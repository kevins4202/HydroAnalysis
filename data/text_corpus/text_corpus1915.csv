multiple inlet rice flood distribution miri and miri plus alternate wetting drying flood management awd and one furrow irrigated with end blocking row system seasonal applied irrigation soil volumetric water holding content water depth grain yield and irrigation water use efficiency iwue were determined for sixteen 16 ha commercial rice fields sown using the same hybrid each year also runoff from one field for each system was measured each year average seasonal irrigation applications were 824 197 mm for casc 641 165 mm for miri 696 181 mm for awd and 631 125 mm for row although a minimum of two awd dry down cycles were performed each year and runoff was the least from miri 5 runoff and awd 3 runoff row 13 runoff was the only system to receive less irrigation p 0 0314 than casc 14 runoff in terms of grain yield only the row fields with an average yield of 8890 417 kg ha 1 differed p 0 0107 from casc 9991 751 kg ha 1 this reduction in row yield was due primarily to herbicide injury in 2018 and resulted in average irrigation water use efficiency iwue values that were not different between irrigation treatments p 0 05 taken together row with end blocking a proved to be a more consistent method of water conservation than miri and awd under field conditions complicated by variable soil textures and b lends itself to automation as the row fields were irrigated regularly on a three to four day schedule rather than depending on human judgement to decide when to irrigate as was required for casc miri and awd keywords rice irrigation cascade rice flood multiple inlet rice irrigation alternate wetting and drying flood management furrow irrigated rice irrigation water use efficiencies irrigation water dynamics 1 introduction the mississippi embayment aquifer system me is a major resource of the united states in particular the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer mrvaa supplies irrigation water to nearly four million hectares of crops as well to aquaculture and other users water levels of the mrvaa are steadily declining owing to excessive irrigation withdrawals clark et al 2011 marston et al 2015 attributed over 70 of all virtual groundwater transfers from the me to rice oryza sativa l produced in arkansas thus rice production plays a significant role in mrvaa decline however rice produced in arkansas using the mrvaa also produces total economic impacts of over 1 7 billion while the production of all agronomic crops in the lmrb supplied by the mrvaa generate total economic impacts of over 11 5 billion alhassan et al 2019 because the united states is a top five rice exporter childs 2021 continued decline of the mrvaa will have both national and international ramifications marston et al 2015 alhassan et al 2019 not to mention impacts on regional ecology barlow and leake 2012 yasarer et al 2020 in addition to its top position in rice production arkansas also ranks third nationally in terms of total area of irrigated cropland hrozencik 2021 using traditional practices rice typically receives three to five times more irrigation water applied to maize soybean and cotton grown in the lmrb reba et al 2014 massey et al 2017 henry et al 2016 farmers in arkansas and across the lmrb are aware of this issue and have been steadily working to reduce rice irrigation inputs by adopting practices such as zero grade level basin miri awd and row hardke 2019 rice production in the united states is a small but not insignificant source of methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o gases usepa 2021 near term efforts to address global climate change often focus on reducing ch4 smith and mizrahi 2013 thus as the largest producer of rice the majority of which is still grown using a traditional continuous cascade flood hardke 2019 rice producers in arkansas and across the lmrb have an opportunity to reduce ch4 emissions by adopting practices such as awd as even a single dry down period can reduce ch4 by up to 40 linquist et al 2018 farmers rely on economic information when making decisions as to which production practices to employ liu et al 2018 a growing body of farm based economic research exists for different irrigation and conservation practices applicable to the production of rice vories et al 2005 watkins et al 2006 atwill et al 2020 soybean bryant et al 2017 wood et al 2017 pringle et al 2019 maize spencer et al 2019 and cotton plumblee et al 2019 in the lmrb however only a limited number of farm based studies have been conducted in the lmrb that measure greenhouse gas emissions linquist et al 2018 and fewer still have directly compared all major rice irrigation systems under the same conditions where measurements of irrigation use greenhouse gas emissions yield and economics were performed this study sought to help address this need the objectives were to compare three rice irrigation management systems awd miri row to the conventional practice of continuous flood using a cascade distribution casc under commercial conditions in terms of irrigation water use efficiencies water dynamics greenhouse gas emissions and economics irrigation efficiency and water dynamics are presented here gas emissions and economic results are to be published in separate reports 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and soil properties this study was conducted during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons on 16 fields that are part of a 6000 ha rice soybean farm near victoria arkansas the cooperating producer is a fourth generation farmer with a history of participating in agricultural research fig 1 depicts the arrangement of the adjoining 400 400 m fields that averaged 15 6 0 7 ha the fields have been cropped to a 1 1 or 1 2 rice soybean rotation for many seasons in 2010 the fields were precision graded to have 0 1 slope with no cross slope each field was surrounded by an elevated pad i e roadway and drained by two slotted board risers that served as flood control structures i e water outlets the 16 fields were arranged in four blocks of four fields each block was irrigated by a separate groundwater well connected to a network of underground pipes so that each field was irrigated via its own hydrant i e water inlet well capacities averaged approximately 150 l s 1 resulting in irrigation delivery rates of about 9 5 l s 1 ha 1 groundwater was derived from the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer a weather station campbell scientific logan ut was located on site and provided standard meteorological parameters e g air temperature rainfall solar radiation relative humidity study area soils are classified as a sharkey steele complex characterized by clay to silty clays interspersed with loamy sands and fine sandy loams nrcs web soil survey to determine if the precision grading in 2010 significantly impacted surface soil features of the study area textural assessments were performed post harvest in 2018 and 2019 using soil electromagnetic conductivity dualem inc sunderland on the conductivity results indicate that the percentages of soil textures remained largely as reported in the 1971 nrcs soil survey data not shown and thus the nrcs textural classes were used in subsequent analyses 2 2 agronomics farm personnel performed all field operations including soil preparation planting pest management fertilization and harvest tractors sprayers and combines were equipped with differential gps guidance systems and machine data collection software john deere moline il table 1 summarizes the agronomic practices of this two year study following a 2016 soybean crop all fields but the four used for row treatments were prepared for rice planting using a kelly diamond disc chain harrow to remove raised beds the rice hybrid xp753 ricetec alvin tx was planted at rates of 25 8 and 26 6 kg ha 1 using an air seeder john deere molin il on 01 02 april 2017 and 09 10 april 2018 respectively the levee areas in the casc miri and awd fields were not seeded and were not included in yield calculations rice harvest was performed using john deere moline in combines equipped with moisture and yield monitors these monitors were calibrated multiple times each harvest season with the latter also regularly compared against an on site certified truck scale to ensure accuracy each field was harvested separately i e less than full loads were taken to scales the truck weight receipts were ultimately used to determine yields while the combine data was used to prepare yield maps at the farmer s request row treatments returned to these same fields in both study years for the remaining 12 fields casc miri and awd treatments were randomly assigned in 2017 and were rotated in a clockwise direction in 2018 fig 1 a prior to flood initiation each spring six levees buns were constructed about 60 m apart on each casc miri and awd field in terms of fertilization conventional rice production in arkansas uses a delayed flood system where the majority of nitrogen fertilizer is applied immediately prior to flood initiation at v3 v4 hardke 2018 in 2017 row received a total of 678 kg ha 1 urea in six applications compared to 532 kg ha 1 applied in four applications to flooded treatments in 2018 row received the same 414 kg ha 1 urea applied to the other treatments but this was performed in a 3 way rather than 2 way application though fertilization programs varied in 2017 and 2018 the three flooded treatments casc miri awd always received the same fertilizer amounts and timings table 1 all irrigation treatments received ammonium sulfate as a starter fertilizer with 2017 or without 2018 urea 46 0 0 the urea fertilizer was treated with a urease inhibitor midtech r d inc st paul mn to reduce nitrogen losses 2 3 pest management as guidelines for row are still being refined pest control practices generally followed those recommended for flooded rice production hardke 2018 typically hybrid rice requires no treatments for disease and no fungicides were applied in this study a confounding factor related to palmer amaranth control occurred in the 2018 row fields a newly commercialized herbicide caused significant rice injury hardke et al 2019 resulting in measurable yield loss as compared to the 2017 row treatments thus a considerable but unknown portion of the 2018 row yield losses are attributable to this herbicide injury 2 4 irrigation management and measurement the same conscientious farm employee was assigned by the farmer to irrigate the 2017 and 2018 study fields research personnel determined the timings and durations of the awd treatment unlike the other three treatments where irrigation was applied largely on an as needed basis row irrigation was applied every three to four days to ensure that soil in the upper aerobic zone remained moist season long irrigation applications were measured using a mccrometer hemet ca propeller flowmeter installed in every field at the beginning of each irrigation season the 25 cm diameter flowmeters were installed as per manufacturer instructions to ensure accurate readings flowmeter readings were recorded manually on a near daily basis rainfall was measured manually using an all weather rain gauge forestry suppliers jackson ms located at block 400 season long runoff from a subset of fields was measured each growing season runoff from four fields in block 100 2017 and block 200 2018 was measured at each outlet using an isco model 6712 sampler equipped with model 750 area velocity av flow module to continuously measure flow rates teledyne isco lincoln ne each system was powered by using a 12 v system that consisted of two 550 cca deep cycle marine batteries maintained with a solar charging regulator and 20 w solar panel the runoff equipment and field setup were similar to that depicted by aryal et al 2018 the av flow sensors were attached to scissor type mounting rings installed in one of the 45 cm inner diameter steel outlet pipes of each randomly selected field field surveys were performed to apportion the amount of runoff represented by the outlet from which runoff was quantified flow data were processed using flowlink ver 5 1 software teledyne isco lincoln ne within each field a continuous data logging system measured a volumetric soil moisture content tdr 315 acclima meridian id at two depths 8 and 15 cm and b flood water height using an ultrasonic sensor 7589 sxcl maxsonar wrmt maxbotix inc fort mill s c each system was installed in the third paddy of each awd casc and miri field additionally a similar station was installed at the top aerobic zone and bottom saturated zone of each row field each ultrasonic sensor was installed on top of 20 cm x 45 cm pvc field tube irri 2021 which allowed water heights to be measured above and below the soil surface soil moisture and water level data were stored on cr1000 loggers campbell scientific inc logan ut as part of a wireless sensor network described in detail by chiu and reba 2020 all four replications of a treatment were irrigated simultaneously for all treatments and years irrigation was initiated within one day of the preflood urea applications made on 27 may 2017 and 27 may 2018 irrigation was terminated on 10 august 2017 and 15 august 2018 resulting in 76 day and 81 day irrigation periods respectively table 1 irrigation ceased about two weeks prior to harvest on levee fields and about one week prior on row fields irrigation water use efficiency iwue values were calculated similar to vories et al 2005 where iwue kg ha 1 mm 1 rough rice yield kg ha 1 applied irrigation mm rough paddy rice grain yields were normalized to 14 moisture descriptions of the irrigation management systems are given below 2 5 irrigation management treatments continuous flood using cascade distribution casc this is the most common rice irrigation practice in the lmrb and thus served as the study control here irrigation was delivered to the top paddy of each field using a single riser a flowmeter followed by a length of pvc pipe that ended in a 90 elbow was attached to the riser the elbow ensured that accurate i e full pipe flow measurements were made farm staff determined when to irrigate by visually inspecting the water levels in each paddy with the goal of maintaining a 5 10 cm flood across each field irrigation ceased when all paddies were deemed sufficiently filled continuous flood using multiple inlet distribution miri as described by vories et al 2005 irrigation water was delivered to each paddy simultaneously via 38 cm width x 10 mil thickness lay flat plastic tubing delta plastics little rock ar the tubing was installed perpendicular to the levees and multiple 5 cm diameter holes punched in the tubing to allow water flow into each paddy the tubing was attached to a flowmeter that was installed in a riser as with casc the farm employee visually inspected water levels in each paddy and initiated irrigation as necessary to maintain a 5 10 cm flood irrigation was halted when paddies were deemed sufficiently filled by the farm employee miri safe alternate wetting drying flood management awd poly tubing was installed and irrigation water applied as with miri except the flood was allowed to periodically subside to mud in the upper portions of the upper three paddies the dry down cycles were initiated after an initial two to three week holding period to stabilize nitrogen fertilizer and to allow for canopy closure henry et al 2017 while the timing extent and duration of the dry down periods was impacted by the prevailing weather especially rainfall the goal was to impose at least two dry down periods prior to rice heading when mud was exposed in the upper one third to one half of the upper three paddies irrigation was resumed and continued until all paddies were refilled furrow irrigation row rice was grown on raised seedbeds that were approximately 10 cm tall and 96 cm wide poly tubing 38 cm x 10 mil delta plastics little rock ar was used to deliver water to every furrow along each bed computerized hole selection software pipe planner delta plastics little rock ar was used to determine optimal hole size required to evenly distribute irrigation to each field irrigation began on the same day as the other three treatments and occurred every three to four days when rice at the bottom of the row fields was sufficiently tall to withstand continuous inundation boards were installed in the water outlets to reduce field runoff end blocking occurred about three to four weeks after flood initiation on 27 may table 1 when combined with field slope end blocking effectively creates three soil moisture regimes an upper aerobic zone a bottom flooded zone and a mid field section that cycles between aerobic and saturated conditions fig 1 b 2 6 statistical analysis the glimmix procedure of sas was used to conduct analysis of variance statistical analytical system release 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc for each response variable data were analyzed as a mixed model with irrigation treatment as a fixed effect and year and block year as random effects degrees of freedom were estimated using the kenward roger method kenward and roger 1997 for irrigation water applied planned comparisons casc vs awd casc vs miri casc vs row awd vs miri awd vs row and miri vs row were made using the contrast statement simple linear regression using excel ver 2107 microsoft redmond wa was performed to evaluate the relationships between irrigation applications and field soil clay contents 3 results and discussion 3 1 overview table 2 provides a summary of environmental conditions during 2017 and 2018 owing to a dry spring flush irrigation was applied on 08 may 2018 to all fields to facilitate seed germination and to activate herbicides the amounts of flush irrigation which averaged 73 24 mm n 16 were not included in the 2018 seasonal irrigation values or subsequent statistical analyses a weak to moderate r 0 457 relationship fig a 1 was found to exist between the amounts of irrigation water applied to each field and corresponding clay plus clay loam contents table a 1 henry et al 2016 reported conflicting results regarding the influence of soil texture on rice irrigation in arkansas depending on the dataset used farmers applied less p 0 01 or the same p 0 08 irrigation amounts to clay versus silt loam soils soil texture and irrigation management interact to influence irrigation application especially for practices that reduce flood depth that in turn reduce deep percolation losses in permeable soils bouman et al 1994 when the seasonal irrigation water applications were ranked highest to lowest the largest application and potential outlier was the value of 1380 mm irrigation applied to miri field 103 in 2018 table a 1 this value was more than double the two year miri average of 650 mm observed in the present study table 3 and also exceeded average miri values reported by atwill et al 2020 henry et al 2016 massey et al 2017 and vories et al 2005 however the value fell within the range of values 300 to 1500 mm n 73 reported by these same authors inspection of the cumulative seasonal irrigation applied to miri field 103 relative to the other 2018 miri treatments fig 2 a and other irrigation systems in block 100 fig 2 b indicate no repeated episodes of excessive irrigation as might occur when irrigation was not shut off in a timely manner rather field 103 was irrigated approximately 37 times over the 81 day irrigation season whereas miri field 401 was irrigated 19 times fig a 2 large variations in flood depth measured using ultrasonic sensors located in the third paddy of each levee field occurred in miri field 103 relative to miri field 401 moreover miri field 103 had an average water level decline rate of 1 65 1 41 mm h 1 n 6 versus 0 64 0 95 mm h 1 n 4 for miri field 104 taken together these results demonstrate the large variability in irrigation applications that can occur in adjacent fields even while being managed by experienced field personnel regardless data for miri field 103 irrigation application yield and iwue were omitted from the statistical analyses presented below 3 2 cascade casc flood distribution table 3 provides 2 year averages for seasonal irrigation applied in 2017 and 2018 results from other fields studies are also provided for comparison average and standard deviation values for casc 824 197 mm compare favorably with long term studies involving straight levee rice fields for example henry et al 2016 reported that during 2005 2012 arkansas farmers applied 820 270 mm n 39 using casc in mississippi farmers applied an average of 980 320 mm n 165 during 2002 2013 massey et al 2017 in shorter duration studies atwill et al 2020 vories et al 2005 and cooke et al 1996 similarly report that producers applied 896 320 mm n 19 911 256 mm n 14 and 737 270 mm n 82 respectively thus present study casc results reflect those of irrigation applied by producers to other straight levee rice fields in the lmrb fig 2 b depicts the season long irrigation applications made to casc field 102 relative to the other treatments in block 100 in 2018 season long runoff from two casc fields ranged from 60 to 220 mm table 4 depending on the denominator used this runoff represents an average of 14 10 of the applied irrigation or 11 7 of applied irrigation plus rainfall received during the irrigation period with casc flood distribution each up field paddy must be filled before water flows to the next paddy making runoff losses difficult to avoid even under well managed conditions vories et al 2005 massey et al 2019 3 3 multiple inlet rice irrigation miri flood distribution the average and standard deviation values for miri 641 165 mm n 7 agree with average seasonal irrigation applications of 708 233 mm n 19 798 307 mm n 18 795 296 mm n 41 and 688 171 mm n 14 reported by atwill et al 2020 henry et al 2016 massey et al 2017 and vories et al 2005 respectively table 3 miri conserves water by improving a application efficiency and b rainfall capture massey et al 2018 and has an expected irrigation savings in the lmrb of 24 relative to casc massey et al 2017 for the present study othe calculated miri irrigation savings were 22 2 thus it was expected that the savings would be significant similar to the significant savings reported by atwill et al 2020 massey et al 2017 and vories et al 2005 however the savings were not significant p 0 0562 when assessed at α 0 05 the lack of significant difference is likely due to the smaller sample size of this short term study season long runoff from two miri fields ranged from 25 to 30 mm table 4 this runoff represented an average of 5 of the applied irrigation or 3 1 of applied irrigation plus rainfall received during the irrigation season these values were approximately one third those measured for casc likely reflecting greater control of the rice flood achieved with miri vories et al 2005 it is notable that standard errors associated with published miri results table 3 are generally lower than those of casc and may also reflect improved control of flood management afforded by miri 3 4 awd flood management compared to casc and miri there is limited data available on awd irrigation management of commercial rice fields in the lmrb massey et al 2014 first reported an additional 30 savings beyond miri when awd was used in conjunction with miri in mississippi rice fields atwill et al 2020 reported a difference p 0 0001 in irrigation applications made by mississippi farmers using casc 708 233 mm and awd 546 159 mm representing a 23 reduction in a two year university trial conducted by chlapecka et al 2021 in arkansas using large field plots and the same rice hybrid as the present study i e xp753 irrigation applied using casc averaged approximately 765 mm while awd using 45 kpa as the irrigation threshold received an average of about 420 mm representing a significant p 0 05 savings of approximately 45 in the present study irrigation applications made using awd 696 181 mm were not different p 0 1600 than casc 824 197 mm table 3 the awd irrigation applications were also not different p 0 05 from miri fig 3 depicts variations in volumetric soil water content vwc at 15 cm as a function of irrigation management and field location in 2018 the average vwc values for casc field 102 awd field 101 and miri field 103 were 46 7 0 7 41 2 1 6 and 42 4 0 6 respectively for the 81 d irrigation period fig 3 a thus although the vwc profiles reflect that a minimum of two wetting drying cycles were imposed on the awd field corresponding seasonal irrigation applications were 670 and 880 mm for casc field 102 39 5 clay and awd field 101 15 9 clay respectively moreover season long methane flux was less from awd field 203 in 2017 and awd field 204 in 2018 compared to miri field 204 in 2017 and miri field 203 in 2018 reba et al in preparation taken together these data suggest that soil texture may take precedence over irrigation management in determining season long irrigation application and methane flux rates mirroring some of the complexity reported by henry et al 2016 season long runoff from two awd fields ranged from 10 to 40 mm table 4 this runoff represented an average of 3 2 of the applied irrigation or 2 2 of applied irrigation plus rainfall received during the irrigation period awd flood management reduces irrigation applications because a a shallower than average flood depth is maintained and b resulting increased freeboard increases rainfall capture bouman et al 2005 massey et al 2014 in turn reduced irrigation coupled with increased rainfall capture reduces the amount of runoff leaving the field like miri the awd values were approximately one third the runoff measured for casc 3 5 row furrow irrigation a producer in stoddard county missouri is credited with developing a furrow irrigated rice system adapted to production conditions of the lmrb tracy et al 1991 stevens et al 2020 this system is somewhat related to the non puddled aerobic rice approach described by bouman et al 2005 yet nearly 30 years since first practiced in missouri only limited information exists on the amounts of irrigation typically applied to commercial scale row fields tracy et al 1991 reported a range of 330 530 mm for missouri trials conducted between 1988 and 1990 research conducted by chlapecka et al 2021 on large field plots having furrow lengths up to 366 m long found that when row was scheduled using a 45kpa irrigation threshold irrigation applications were reduced by 34 relative to casc p 0 05 in the present study row applications averaged 632 125 mm n 8 a value that was 23 less p 0 03142 than casc table 5 fig 3 b compares vwc values 15 cm in the third paddy of casc field 102 to those of the aerobic zone fig 1 b of row field 104 average vwc values for the casc field and the row field were 46 7 0 7 and 45 2 3 4 respectively thus the soil moisture remained consistently saturated with casc management while the row treatment cycled between saturation and less than saturated at three to four day intervals reflecting the regular irrigation patterned employed on row fields during this study season long runoff from two row fields ranged from 15 to 130 mm table 4 representing 13 14 of the applied irrigation or 10 12 of applied irrigation plus rainfall received during the irrigation period these values are similar to casc but numerically higher than miri and awd likely reflecting increased early season runoff losses associated with delayed end blocking of the row fields fig 1 b 3 6 grain yield irrigation water use efficiency iwue fig 4 depicts yield maps from machine harvests in 2017 and 2018 the maps have the same orientation as fig 1 a key feature is the herbicide injury in the 2018 row fields due to the previously mentioned issue which resulted in row treatments yielding 15 less p 0 0107 less than casc this herbicide labelling issue has since been resolved hardke et al 2019 no yield differences between the other irrigation treatments were detected p 0 05 end blocking creates one of the most agronomically challenging aspects of row irrigation a continuum of soil moisture ranging from aerobic to continuously flooded hardke and chlapecka 2021 and stevens et al 2020 reported that the largest grain yields typically occur at the bottoms of row fields fig 3 c shows how vwc differed at the top and bottom of row field 104 and how these were similar to casc field 102 fig 3 b these differences did not always appear to translate into lower yields in the 2017 harvest maps depicted in fig 4 a no differences in iwue were observed between any of the irrigation treatments table 5 awd has been associated with significant p 0 0001 iwue improvements relative to casc and miri in mississippi atwill et al 2020 where awd iwue values averaged 16 7 4 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 in the present study awd iwue values averaged 15 60 4 23 kg ha 1 mm 1 and were not statistically different from the other treatments presumably this was at least partially due to the aforementioned role that soil texture variability plays in determining on farm irrigation applications bouman et al 1994 henry et al 2016 despite the row yield reductions observed in 2018 fig 4 there was no measurable impact on iwue p 0 1120 this was largely due to the 23 increase in water savings p 0 0399 achieved when using row relative to casc by comparison chlapecka et al 2021 reported that row iwue was increased by 42 relative to casc the iwue values in table a 1 demonstrate a wide range of productivity for example the ten fields receiving the lowest irrigation applications received 47 less p 0 0001 irrigation water and had iwue values 42 larger p 0 0001 than the ten fields receiving the highest irrigation amounts as previously indicated not all of this variation can be attributed to irrigation management however a challenge in large scale irrigation management relates to logistics namely having adequate staff available to optimally manage each field given the level of variability observed some level of automation may be required to assist large scale producers in further refining irrigation management as necessary for optimal yields and continued improvements in water use efficiency use of a pump shutoff timer spring wound or as part of a more sophisticated automation system when coupled with field sensors may suffice to allow refinements that avoid over and under irrigation 4 conclusion this farm based research adds to a growing body of literature on water saving rice irrigation practices available to lmrb producers namely row with end blocking in the present study row reduced on farm applications by 23 relative to the industry standard casc while maintaining iwue row represents a major shift away from levees and its use has grown recently owing to reduced labor associated with rice levees and increased flexibility in responding to changing market weather and production conditions this research also provides evidence of environmental benefits beyond water conservation miri and awd appeared to reduce field runoff compared to casc while runoff from row was similar to casc however taken together row with end blocking a proved to be a more consistent method of water conservation than miri and awd under field conditions complicated by variable soil textures and b lends itself to automation as the row fields were irrigated regularly on a three to four day schedule rather than depending on human judgement to decide when to irrigate as was required for casc miri and awd declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

9575,this two year field study compared the industry standard rice oryza sativa l irrigation practice a continuous flood delivered using cascade distribution casc to two related levee based systems multiple inlet rice flood distribution miri and miri plus alternate wetting drying flood management awd and one furrow irrigated with end blocking row system seasonal applied irrigation soil volumetric water holding content water depth grain yield and irrigation water use efficiency iwue were determined for sixteen 16 ha commercial rice fields sown using the same hybrid each year also runoff from one field for each system was measured each year average seasonal irrigation applications were 824 197 mm for casc 641 165 mm for miri 696 181 mm for awd and 631 125 mm for row although a minimum of two awd dry down cycles were performed each year and runoff was the least from miri 5 runoff and awd 3 runoff row 13 runoff was the only system to receive less irrigation p 0 0314 than casc 14 runoff in terms of grain yield only the row fields with an average yield of 8890 417 kg ha 1 differed p 0 0107 from casc 9991 751 kg ha 1 this reduction in row yield was due primarily to herbicide injury in 2018 and resulted in average irrigation water use efficiency iwue values that were not different between irrigation treatments p 0 05 taken together row with end blocking a proved to be a more consistent method of water conservation than miri and awd under field conditions complicated by variable soil textures and b lends itself to automation as the row fields were irrigated regularly

me is a major resource of the united states in particular the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer mrvaa supplies irrigation water to nearly four million hectares of crops as well to aquaculture and other users water levels of the mrvaa are steadily declining owing to excessive irrigation withdrawals clark et al 2011 marston et al 2015 attributed over 70 of all virtual groundwater transfers from the me to rice oryza sativa l produced in arkansas thus rice production plays a significant role in mrvaa decline however rice produced in arkansas using the mrvaa also produces total economic

2016 farmers in arkansas and across the lmrb are aware of this issue and have been steadily working to reduce rice irrigation inputs by adopting practices such as zero grade level basin miri awd and

arkansas and across the lmrb have an opportunity to reduce ch4 emissions by adopting practices such as awd as even a single dry down period can reduce ch4 by up to 40 linquist et al 2018 farmers rely on economic information when making decisions as to which production practices to employ liu et al 2018 a growing body of farm based economic research exists for different irrigation and conservation

plumblee et al 2019 in the lmrb however only a limited number of farm based studies have been conducted in the lmrb that measure greenhouse gas emissions linquist et al 2018 and fewer still have directly compared all major rice irrigation systems under the same conditions where measurements of irrigation use greenhouse gas emissions yield and economics were performed this study sought to help address this need the objectives were to compare three rice irrigation management systems awd miri row to the conventional practice of continuous flood using a cascade distribution casc under commercial conditions in terms of irrigation water use efficiencies water dynamics greenhouse gas emissions and economics irrigation efficiency and water dynamics are presented here gas emissions and economic results are to be published in separate reports 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and soil properties this study was conducted during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons on 16 fields that are part of a 6000 ha rice soybean farm near victoria arkansas the cooperating producer is a fourth generation farmer with a history of participating in agricultural research fig 1 depicts the arrangement of the adjoining 400 400 m fields that averaged 15 6 0 7 ha the fields have been cropped to a 1 1 or 1 2 rice soybean rotation for many seasons in 2010 the fields were precision graded to have 0 1 slope with no cross slope each field was surrounded by an elevated pad i e roadway and drained by two slotted board risers that served as flood control structures i e water outlets the 16 fields were arranged in four blocks of four fields each block was irrigated by a separate groundwater well connected to a network of underground pipes so that each field was irrigated via its own hydrant i e water inlet well capacities averaged approximately 150 l s 1 resulting in irrigation delivery rates of about 9 5 l s 1 ha 1 groundwater was derived from the mississippi river valley

area soils are classified as a sharkey steele complex characterized by clay to silty clays interspersed with loamy sands and fine sandy loams nrcs web soil survey to determine if the precision grading in 2010 significantly impacted surface soil features of the study area textural assessments were performed post harvest in 2018 and 2019 using soil electromagnetic conductivity dualem inc sunderland on the conductivity results indicate that the percentages of soil textures remained largely as reported in the 1971 nrcs soil survey data not shown and thus the nrcs textural classes were used in subsequent analyses 2 2 agronomics farm personnel performed all field operations including soil preparation planting pest management fertilization and harvest tractors sprayers and combines were equipped with differential gps guidance systems and machine data collection software john deere moline il table 1 summarizes the agronomic practices of this two year study following a 2016 soybean crop all fields but the four used for row treatments were prepared for rice planting using a kelly diamond disc chain harrow to remove raised beds the rice hybrid xp753 ricetec alvin tx was planted at rates of 25 8 and 26 6 kg ha 1 using an air seeder john deere molin il on 01 02 april 2017 and 09 10 april 2018 respectively the levee areas in the casc miri and awd fields were not seeded and were not included in yield calculations rice harvest was performed using john deere moline in combines equipped with moisture and yield monitors these monitors were calibrated multiple times each harvest season with the latter also regularly compared against an on site certified truck scale to ensure accuracy each field was harvested separately i e less than full loads were taken to scales the truck weight receipts were ultimately used to determine yields while the combine data was used to prepare yield maps at the farmer s request row treatments returned to these same fields in both study years for the remaining 12 fields casc miri and awd treatments were randomly assigned in 2017 and were rotated in a clockwise direction in 2018 fig 1 a prior to flood initiation each spring six levees buns were constructed about 60 m apart on each casc miri and awd field in terms of fertilization conventional rice production in arkansas uses a delayed flood system where the majority of nitrogen fertilizer is applied immediately prior to flood initiation at v3 v4 hardke 2018 in 2017 row received a total of 678 kg ha 1 urea in six applications compared to 532 kg ha 1 applied in four applications to flooded treatments in 2018 row received the same 414 kg ha 1 urea applied to the other treatments but this was performed in a 3 way rather than 2 way application though fertilization programs varied in 2017 and 2018 the three flooded treatments casc miri awd always received the same fertilizer amounts and timings table 1 all irrigation treatments received ammonium sulfate as a starter fertilizer with 2017 or without 2018 urea 46 0 0 the urea fertilizer was treated with a urease inhibitor midtech r d inc st paul mn to reduce nitrogen losses 2 3 pest management as guidelines for row are still being refined pest control practices generally followed those recommended for flooded rice production hardke 2018 typically hybrid rice requires no treatments for disease and no fungicides were applied in this study a confounding factor related to palmer amaranth control occurred in the 2018 row fields a newly commercialized herbicide caused significant rice injury hardke et al 2019 resulting in measurable yield loss as compared to the 2017 row treatments thus a considerable but unknown portion of the 2018 row yield losses are attributable to this herbicide injury 2 4 irrigation management and measurement the same conscientious farm employee was assigned by the farmer to irrigate the 2017 and 2018 study fields research personnel determined the timings and durations of the awd treatment unlike the other three treatments where irrigation was applied largely on an as needed basis row irrigation was applied every three to four days to ensure that soil in the upper aerobic zone remained moist season long irrigation applications were measured using a mccrometer hemet ca propeller flowmeter installed in every field at the beginning of each irrigation season the 25 cm diameter flowmeters were installed as per manufacturer instructions to ensure accurate readings flowmeter readings were recorded manually on a near daily basis rainfall was measured manually using an all weather rain gauge forestry suppliers jackson ms located at block 400 season long runoff from a subset of fields was measured each growing season runoff from four fields in block 100 2017 and block 200 2018 was measured at each outlet using an isco model 6712 sampler equipped with model 750 area velocity av flow module to continuously measure flow rates teledyne isco lincoln ne each system was powered by using a 12 v system that consisted of two 550 cca deep cycle marine batteries maintained with a solar charging regulator and 20 w solar panel the runoff equipment and field setup were similar to that depicted by aryal et al 2018 the av flow sensors were attached to scissor type mounting rings installed in one of the 45 cm inner diameter steel outlet pipes of each randomly selected field field surveys were performed to apportion the amount of runoff represented by the outlet from which runoff was quantified flow data were processed using flowlink ver 5 1 software teledyne isco lincoln ne within each field a continuous data logging system measured a volumetric soil moisture content tdr 315 acclima meridian id at two depths 8 and 15 cm and b flood water height using an ultrasonic sensor 7589 sxcl maxsonar wrmt maxbotix inc fort mill s c each system was installed in the third paddy of each awd casc and miri field additionally a similar station was installed at the top aerobic zone and bottom saturated zone of each row field each ultrasonic sensor was installed on top of 20 cm x 45 cm pvc field tube irri 2021 which allowed water heights to be measured above and below the soil surface soil moisture and water level data were stored on cr1000 loggers campbell scientific inc logan ut as part of a wireless sensor network described in detail by chiu and reba 2020 all four replications of a treatment were irrigated simultaneously for all treatments and years irrigation was initiated within one day of the preflood urea applications made on 27 may 2017 and 27 may 2018 irrigation was terminated on 10 august 2017 and 15 august 2018 resulting in 76 day and 81 day irrigation periods respectively table 1 irrigation ceased about two weeks prior to harvest on levee fields and about one week prior on row fields irrigation water use efficiency iwue values were calculated similar to vories et al 2005 where iwue kg ha 1 mm 1 rough rice yield kg ha 1 applied irrigation mm rough paddy rice grain yields were normalized to 14 moisture descriptions of the irrigation management systems are given below 2 5 irrigation management treatments continuous flood using cascade distribution casc this is the most common rice irrigation practice in the lmrb and thus served as the study control here irrigation was delivered to the top paddy of each field using a single riser a flowmeter followed by a length of pvc pipe that ended in a 90 elbow was attached to the riser the elbow ensured that accurate i e full pipe flow measurements were made farm staff determined when to irrigate by visually inspecting the water levels in each paddy with the goal of maintaining a 5 10 cm flood across each field irrigation ceased when all paddies were deemed sufficiently filled continuous flood using multiple inlet distribution miri as described by vories et al 2005 irrigation water was delivered to each paddy simultaneously via 38 cm width x 10 mil thickness lay flat plastic tubing delta plastics little rock ar the tubing was installed perpendicular to the levees and multiple 5 cm diameter holes punched in the tubing to allow water flow into each paddy the tubing was attached to a flowmeter that was installed in a riser as with casc the farm employee visually inspected water levels in each paddy and initiated irrigation as necessary to maintain a 5 10 cm flood irrigation was halted when paddies were deemed sufficiently filled by the farm employee miri safe alternate wetting drying flood management awd poly tubing was installed and irrigation water applied as with miri except the flood was allowed to periodically subside to mud in the upper portions of the upper three paddies the dry down cycles were initiated after an initial two to three week holding period to stabilize nitrogen fertilizer and to allow for canopy closure henry et al 2017 while the timing extent and duration of the dry down periods was impacted by the prevailing weather especially rainfall the goal was to impose at least two dry down periods prior to rice heading when mud was exposed in the upper one third to one half of the upper three paddies irrigation was resumed and continued until all paddies were refilled furrow irrigation row rice was grown on raised seedbeds that were approximately 10 cm tall and 96 cm wide poly tubing 38 cm x 10 mil delta plastics little rock ar was used to deliver water to every furrow along each bed computerized hole selection software pipe planner delta plastics little rock ar was used to determine optimal hole size required to evenly distribute irrigation to each field irrigation began on the same day as the other three treatments and occurred every three to four days when rice at the bottom of the row fields was sufficiently tall to withstand continuous inundation boards were installed in the water outlets to reduce field runoff end blocking occurred about three to four weeks after flood initiation on 27 may table 1 when combined with field slope end blocking effectively creates three soil moisture regimes an upper aerobic zone a bottom flooded zone and a mid field section that cycles between aerobic and saturated conditions fig 1 b 2 6 statistical analysis the glimmix procedure of sas was used to conduct analysis of variance statistical analytical system release 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc for each response variable data were analyzed as a mixed model with irrigation treatment as a fixed effect and year and block year as random effects degrees of freedom were estimated using the kenward roger method kenward and roger 1997 for irrigation water applied planned comparisons casc vs awd casc vs miri casc vs row awd vs miri awd vs row and miri vs row were made using the contrast statement simple linear regression using excel ver 2107 microsoft redmond wa was performed to evaluate the relationships between irrigation applications and field soil clay contents 3 results and discussion 3 1 overview table 2 provides a summary of environmental conditions during 2017 and 2018 owing to a dry spring flush irrigation was applied on 08 may 2018 to all fields to facilitate seed germination and to activate herbicides the amounts of flush irrigation which averaged 73 24 mm n 16 were not included in the 2018 seasonal irrigation values or subsequent statistical analyses a weak to moderate r 0 457 relationship fig a 1 was found to exist between the amounts of irrigation water applied to each field and corresponding clay plus clay loam contents table a 1 henry et al 2016 reported conflicting results regarding the influence of soil texture on rice irrigation in arkansas depending on the dataset used farmers applied less p 0 01 or the same p 0 08 irrigation amounts to clay versus silt loam soils soil texture and irrigation management interact to influence irrigation application especially for practices that reduce flood depth that in turn reduce deep percolation losses in permeable soils bouman et al 1994 when the seasonal irrigation water applications were ranked highest to lowest the largest application and potential outlier was the value of 1380 mm irrigation applied to miri field 103 in 2018 table a 1 this value was more than double the two year miri average of 650 mm observed in the present study table 3 and also exceeded average miri values reported by atwill et al 2020 henry et al 2016 massey et al 2017 and vories et al 2005 however the value fell within the range of values 300 to 1500 mm n 73 reported by these same authors inspection of the cumulative seasonal irrigation applied to miri field 103 relative to the other 2018 miri treatments fig 2 a and other irrigation systems in block 100 fig 2 b indicate no repeated episodes of excessive irrigation as might occur when irrigation was not shut off in a timely manner rather field 103 was irrigated approximately 37 times over the 81 day irrigation season whereas miri field 401 was irrigated 19 times fig a 2 large variations in flood depth measured using ultrasonic sensors located in the third paddy of each levee field occurred in miri field 103 relative to miri field 401 moreover miri field 103 had an average water level decline rate of 1 65 1 41 mm h 1 n 6 versus 0 64 0 95 mm h 1 n 4 for miri field 104 taken together these results demonstrate the large variability in irrigation applications that can occur in adjacent fields even while being managed by experienced field personnel regardless data for miri field 103 irrigation application yield and iwue were omitted from the statistical analyses presented below 3 2 cascade casc flood distribution table 3 provides 2 year averages for seasonal irrigation applied in 2017 and 2018 results from other fields studies are also provided for comparison average and standard deviation values for casc 824 197 mm compare favorably with long term studies involving straight levee rice fields for example henry et al 2016 reported that during 2005 2012 arkansas farmers applied 820 270 mm n 39 using casc in mississippi farmers applied an average of 980 320 mm n 165 during 2002 2013 massey et al 2017 in shorter duration studies atwill et al 2020 vories et al 2005 and cooke et al 1996 similarly report that producers applied 896 320 mm n 19 911 256 mm n 14 and 737 270 mm n 82 respectively thus present study casc results reflect those of irrigation applied by producers to other straight levee rice fields in the lmrb fig 2 b depicts the season long irrigation applications made to casc field 102 relative to the other treatments in block 100 in 2018 season long runoff from two casc fields ranged from 60 to 220 mm table 4 depending on the denominator used this runoff represents an average of 14 10 of the applied irrigation or 11 7 of applied irrigation plus rainfall received during the irrigation period with casc flood distribution each up field paddy must be filled before water flows to the next paddy making runoff losses difficult to avoid even under well managed conditions vories et al 2005 massey et al 2019 3 3 multiple inlet rice irrigation miri flood distribution the average and standard deviation values for miri 641 165 mm n 7 agree with average seasonal irrigation applications of 708 233 mm n 19 798 307 mm n 18 795 296 mm n 41 and 688 171 mm n 14 reported by atwill et al 2020 henry et al 2016 massey et al 2017 and vories et al 2005 respectively table 3 miri conserves water by improving a application efficiency and b rainfall capture massey et al 2018 and has an expected irrigation savings in the lmrb of 24 relative to casc massey et al 2017 for the present study othe calculated miri irrigation savings were 22 2 thus it was expected that the savings would be significant similar to the significant savings reported by atwill et al 2020 massey et al 2017 and vories et al 2005 however the savings were not significant p 0 0562 when assessed at α 0 05 the lack of significant difference is likely due to the smaller sample size of this short term study season long runoff from two miri fields ranged from 25 to 30 mm table 4 this runoff represented an average of 5 of the applied irrigation or 3 1 of applied irrigation plus rainfall received during the irrigation season these values were approximately one third those measured for casc likely reflecting greater control of the rice flood achieved with miri vories et al 2005 it is notable that standard errors associated with published miri results table 3 are generally lower than those of casc and may also reflect improved control of flood management afforded by miri 3 4 awd flood management compared to casc and miri there is limited data available on awd irrigation management of commercial rice fields in the lmrb massey et al 2014 first reported an additional 30 savings beyond miri when awd was used in conjunction with miri in mississippi rice fields atwill et al 2020 reported a difference p 0 0001 in irrigation applications made by mississippi farmers using casc 708 233 mm and awd 546 159 mm representing a 23 reduction in a two year university trial conducted by chlapecka et al 2021 in arkansas using large field plots and the same rice hybrid as the present study i e xp753 irrigation applied using casc averaged approximately 765 mm while awd using 45 kpa as the irrigation threshold received an average of about 420 mm representing a significant p 0 05 savings of approximately 45 in the present study irrigation applications made using awd 696 181 mm were not different p 0 1600 than casc 824 197 mm table 3 the awd irrigation applications were also not different p 0 05 from miri fig 3 depicts variations in volumetric soil water content vwc at 15 cm as a function of irrigation management and field location in 2018 the average vwc values for casc field 102 awd field 101 and miri field 103 were 46 7 0 7 41 2 1 6 and 42 4 0 6 respectively for the 81 d irrigation period fig 3 a thus although the vwc profiles reflect that a minimum of two wetting drying cycles were imposed on the awd field corresponding seasonal irrigation applications were 670 and 880 mm for casc field 102 39 5 clay and awd field 101 15 9 clay respectively moreover season long methane flux was less from awd field 203 in 2017 and awd field 204 in 2018 compared to miri field 204 in 2017 and miri field 203 in 2018 reba et al in preparation taken together these data suggest that soil texture may take precedence over irrigation management in determining season long irrigation application and methane flux rates mirroring some of the complexity reported by henry et al 2016 season long runoff from two awd fields ranged from 10 to 40 mm table 4 this runoff represented an average of 3 2 of the applied irrigation or 2 2 of applied irrigation plus rainfall received during the irrigation period awd flood management reduces irrigation applications because a a shallower than average flood depth is maintained and b resulting increased freeboard increases rainfall capture bouman et al 2005 massey et al 2014 in turn reduced irrigation coupled with increased rainfall capture reduces the amount of runoff leaving the field like miri the awd values were approximately one third the runoff measured for casc 3 5 row furrow irrigation a producer in stoddard county missouri is credited with developing a furrow irrigated rice system adapted to production conditions of the lmrb tracy et al 1991 stevens et al 2020 this system is somewhat related to the non puddled aerobic rice approach described by bouman et al 2005 yet nearly 30 years since first practiced in missouri only limited information exists on the amounts of irrigation typically applied to commercial scale row fields tracy et al 1991 reported a range of 330 530 mm for missouri trials conducted between 1988 and 1990 research conducted by chlapecka et al 2021 on large field plots having furrow lengths up to 366 m long found that when row was scheduled using a 45kpa irrigation threshold irrigation applications were reduced by 34 relative to casc p 0 05 in the present study row applications averaged 632 125 mm n 8 a value that was 23 less p 0 03142 than casc table 5 fig 3 b compares vwc values 15 cm in the third paddy of casc field 102 to those of the aerobic zone fig 1 b of row field 104 average vwc values for the casc field and the row field were 46 7 0 7 and 45 2 3 4 respectively thus the soil moisture remained consistently saturated with casc management while the row treatment cycled between saturation and less than saturated at three to four day intervals reflecting the regular irrigation patterned employed on row fields during this study season long runoff from two row fields ranged from 15 to 130 mm table 4 representing 13 14 of the applied irrigation or 10 12 of applied irrigation plus rainfall received during the irrigation period these values are similar to casc but numerically higher than miri and awd likely reflecting increased early season runoff losses associated with delayed end blocking of the row fields fig 1 b 3 6 grain yield irrigation water use efficiency iwue fig 4 depicts yield maps from machine harvests in 2017 and 2018 the maps have the same orientation as fig 1 a key feature is the herbicide injury in the 2018 row fields due to the previously mentioned issue which resulted in row treatments yielding 15 less p 0 0107 less than casc this herbicide labelling issue has since been resolved hardke et al 2019 no yield differences between the other irrigation treatments were detected p 0 05 end blocking creates one of the most agronomically challenging aspects of row irrigation a continuum of soil moisture ranging from aerobic to continuously flooded hardke and chlapecka 2021 and stevens et al 2020 reported that the largest grain yields typically occur at the bottoms of row fields fig 3 c shows how vwc differed at the top and bottom of row field 104 and how these were similar to casc field 102 fig 3 b these differences did not always appear to translate into lower yields in the 2017 harvest maps depicted in fig 4 a no differences in iwue were observed between any of the irrigation treatments table 5 awd has been associated with significant p 0 0001 iwue improvements relative to casc and miri in mississippi atwill et al 2020 where awd iwue values averaged 16 7 4 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 in the present study awd iwue values averaged 15 60 4 23 kg ha 1 mm 1 and were not statistically different from the other treatments presumably this was at least partially due to the aforementioned role that soil texture variability plays in determining on farm irrigation applications bouman et al 1994 henry et al 2016 despite the row yield reductions observed in 2018 fig 4 there was no measurable impact on iwue p 0 1120 this was largely due to the 23 increase in water savings p 0 0399 achieved when using row relative to casc by comparison chlapecka et al 2021 reported that row iwue was increased by 42 relative to casc the iwue values in table a 1 demonstrate a wide range of productivity for example the ten fields receiving the lowest irrigation applications received 47 less p 0 0001 irrigation water and had iwue values 42 larger p 0 0001 than the ten fields receiving the highest irrigation amounts as previously indicated not all of this variation can be attributed to irrigation management however a challenge in large scale irrigation management relates to logistics namely having adequate staff available to optimally manage each field given the level of variability observed some level of automation may be required to assist large scale producers in further refining irrigation management as necessary for optimal yields and continued improvements in water use efficiency use of a pump shutoff timer spring wound or as part of a more sophisticated automation system when coupled with field sensors may suffice to allow refinements that avoid over and under irrigation 4 conclusion this farm based research adds to a growing body of literature on water saving rice irrigation practices available to lmrb producers namely row with end blocking in the present study row reduced on farm applications by 23 relative to the industry standard casc while maintaining iwue row represents a major shift away from levees and its use has grown recently owing to reduced labor associated with rice levees and increased flexibility in responding to changing market weather and production conditions this research also provides evidence of environmental benefits beyond water conservation miri and awd appeared to reduce field runoff compared to casc while runoff from row was similar to casc however taken together row with end blocking a proved to be a more consistent method of water conservation than miri and awd under field conditions complicated by variable soil textures and b lends itself to automation as the row fields were irrigated regularly on a three to four day schedule rather than depending on human judgement to decide when to irrigate as was required for casc miri and awd declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

9576,water productivity of crops must be increased to meet global demand for farm products while conserving limited water resources throughout the western united states highly productive agricultural regions face more frequent and severe droughts and must allocate limited water resources among competing uses irrigated agriculture accounts for the majority of consumptive water use and has a proportionately important role in managing water shortage water productivity accounting helps inform objective decision making regarding these allocations at the regional local and farm scales publicly available data from several government agencies were re analyzed and combined to quantify interannual changes in consumptive water use water productivity was determined using county level crop survey data satellite based maps of evapotranspiration and weather records for 21 counties located in the eastern snake plain in the us state of idaho for nine years during the period 2009 2019 changes in water productivity over this period suggest trends that correspond to crop specific irrigation practices interannual variability in water supply and regional attempts to curtail water consumption and improve water use efficiency results indicate that at regional scales water productivity for alfalfa can increase despite or as a result of water limited conditions increasing from 0 5 to 1 75 kg ha 1 m 3 in some individual counties over the 10 year period which may indicate increasingly efficient water use water productivity of barley and wheat crops also varied year to year but did not demonstrate clear independence from total water consumption instead irrigated areas and crops with adequate water supply follow a general trend of increased yield with increased water consumption and the resulting water productivity approximately follows a linear function of actual evapotranspiration keywords water allocation regional planning quantifying consumptive water use crop irrigation requirements groundwater management 1 introduction sustainable development goals at regional national and international levels all indicate that agricultural production must be maintained or increased while consuming fewer resources cai et al 2011 tilman et al 2002 in water limited regions this implies that water productivity wp needs to increase in one of two ways wp increases because greater yields are obtained using the same water allocation or wp increases by sustaining the same crop yield with reduced water application bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 molden et al 2010 trout et al 2020 depleted aquifers increased regulation of water resources and competition between water use sectors all motivate irrigators to reduce irrigation and use available water strategically jovanovic et al 2020 qin et al 2019 increasingly frequent droughts curtailment of water rights access and perennial uncertainty about water availability contribute to greater competition among water usage sectors arellano gonzalez and moore 2020 medellín azuara et al 2016 irrigators and water managers are under pressure to achieve greater water use efficiency mitigate drought and groundwater overdraft and manage cross sector competition for water resources owen 2014 in order to support these monumental tasks a relevant and practical measure of water productivity is needed to guide water allocation strategies and to evaluate conservation measures a major challenge in quantifying wp is the collection of accurate and extensive data on yield and agricultural water use in the united states crop yields are typically reported on a county basis for major crops and made available through the national agriculture statistics service usda nass this coverage is not completely comprehensive because data are solicited through self reporting surveys aggregation of survey data must be sufficient to ensure anonymity of individual producers and because of practical and budgetary constraints on the extensive nature of these surveys boryan et al 2011 similarly water consumption is also reported by water managers to state agencies such as water resources departments who are mandated to balance pre existing water rights with long term sustainability escriva bou et al 2016 water information is almost invariably reported on the basis of diversion the amount of water removed from surface or ground water supply and is almost never reported in terms of the actual water consumed water is consumed by evaporation from reservoirs lakes and vegetation and this quantity of water is no longer available for beneficial uses including ancillary environmental services in regions with extensive irrigated agriculture the largest portion of consumed water is crop evapotranspiration etc accounting for more than 80 of all consumptive use globally qin et al 2019 siebert and döll 2010 water diversion records cannot directly account for inefficient distribution systems that effectively return some quantity of water to regional storage through run off and infiltration despite this diagnostic approaches to reduce water consumption have focused on increasing water use efficiency and rely on mitigating water losses from distribution and application clemmens and molden 2007 evans and sadler 2008 knox et al 2012 focusing on efficiency alone does not address the central problems of managing limited water supply contor and taylor 2013 grafton et al 2018 perry et al 2009 especially at the scale of managing region water supply kliskey et al 2019 ryu et al 2012 senay et al 2017 furthermore more efficient irrigation systems can increase risk of crop failure and reduce yield trout et al 2020 while precision irrigation strategies may sometimes increase actual water consumption contor and taylor 2013 grafton et al 2018 perry et al 2009 estimates of consumptive use are also critically important in regions which depend on dwindling groundwater resources ghosh et al 2014 tuthill jr et al 2013 application losses such as deep infiltration can contribute significantly to groundwater recharge and intermittent surface storage singh 2014 while difficult to quantify the return flows resulting from irrigation inefficiency often play an important role in meeting interannual water needs within a local area through soil water storage and by meeting non irrigation water requirements the complex and interconnected nature of water resource management necessitate a measure of water productivity that accounts for actual consumption and specifically must quantify the amount of water lost through crop transpiration and soil evaporation significant efforts were made over the past century to develop methods to quantify actual crop irrigation requirements based on consumptive use in order to schedule irrigation and apply water at the same rate as lost through et gowda et al 2016 hargreaves 1994 for many years the predominant technical method to quantify actual crop water requirements has been standardized reference et equations which utilize local weather monitoring and calibrated crop coefficients for individual crops grown in a region droogers and allen 2002 irmak et al 2003 jensen and allen 2016 increasingly information about the actual et eta is available through models based on satellite images of surface color and temperature anderson et al 2012 blankenau et al 2020 blatchford et al 2019 melton et al 2012 used in conjunction with surface weather observations these remote sensing models effectively provide a map of actual et across the entire land surface with a special focus on crop water management several researchers have demonstrated applications which modeled crop yields to estimate water productivity and crop water stress at regional scales cai and sharma 2010 calera et al 2017 campos et al 2018 xue et al 2017 however estimating crop yields by modeling requires substantial effort and technical skills in order to correctly calibrate models and validate against observed data as a result these kinds of modeling applications will always be limited by the budget and technical labor resources available to those state agencies tasked with regulating water resources and irrigation bailey and boryan 2010 calera et al 2017 prokopy et al 2017 another approach to estimate wp can be achieved by combining remote sensing data with ground based yield records without requiring predictive models this simpler approach is chiefly limited by the availability of yield and remote sensing data several researchers have demonstrated the use of local yield data to calculate wp ahmed et al 2010 li et al 2017 el marsafawy et al 2018 wang et al 2018 however the reliability of wp estimates depends on the consistency and accuracy of crop yield data the availability of high resolution commercial satellite imagery may suggest that eta can be estimated at sub field spatial scales however similarly high resolution yield data is difficult to obtain in the united states readily available crop surveys provide annual yield data that are aggregated at county and state levels water productivity calculated from this aggregated yield data and remotely sensed eta can shed light on interannual trends occurring in these sub regional areas the eastern snake plain esp is located within the greater the columbia river basin in southeast idaho usa and is one such semi arid region supporting highly productive agriculture expanding and sustaining extensive irrigated agriculture in this region has required decades of effort to manage the abundant yet increasingly over allocated water resources kliskey et al 2019 ryu et al 2012 wulfhorst and glenn 2002 it was recognized in the 1980s that overdrafting of groundwater was impacting other water users

eastern snake plain is semi arid with the majority of precipitation received in the winter so that irrigation is required to grow most crops lindholm 1996 xu and li 2016 the snake plain is the most important area of agricultural production in idaho the major crops being potatoes sugar beets malting barley wheat and alfalfa alfalfa is also important to a large and growing dairy industry on the eastern snake plain bjorneberg and king 2014 chance et al 2018 this study addresses four goals the first is to assess wp for geographic areas spatial scales at which water allocation decisions are made overall resource allocation decisions are made by idaho s department of water resources but in practice smaller entities such as canal companies and groundwater districts play an important role in seasonal and day to day management the second goal is to assess annual changes in wp for the decade 2009 2019 major changes to water policy and planning are implemented on annual timeframes and this decade 2009 2019 brackets the period around an agreement made in 2015 between surface water and groundwater users to limit groundwater pumping the third study goal is to control for the effect of interannual variability in weather and evaporative demand on wp finally this study combines published data which are readily available to water managers and demonstrates that relatively simple tools can be used to identify trends and changes in wp these tools can provide practical and quantitative information and guide water resource planning the spatial extent and resolution of the analysis was constrained by the availability of the required data crop survey data is aggregated at the county level and maps of modeled actual et are available for the entire eastern snake plain in nine years during the period 2009 2019 fig 1 2 methods water productivity was calculated from yield records and evapotranspiration totals available in public data sources county level yield statistics for alfalfa wheat and barley are available for the majority of the 21 eastern snake plain counties in each of the years investigated tabulated and published by usda nass yield data were obtained from the

the metric model uses landsat images of apparent surface temperature infrared thermal which are rescaled from a native 60 or 100 m spatial resolution in post processing to a 30 m output resolution combined with supporting ground based information the metric model calculates eta by determining spatial variability of sensible heat flux and latent heat flux for an entire landsat scene image and calibrating each scene with hot and cold pixels corresponding to areas with low and high et rates respectively allen et al 2011 2007 anderson et al 2012 the idwr data are trained model outputs

morton et al 2013 following the study goal of using publicly available data the metric maps were used as published without further accuracy assessment daily reference et data were used to normalize actual et maps and control for interannual and regional variability in crop water requirements time series of daily reference et were obtained from the usbr agrimet data portal https www usbr gov pn agrimet accessed may 2021 from 18 weather stations located throughout the eastern snake plain eleven of these stations reported for the entire period 2009 2019 records from the other seven stations were available from 2014 to 2019 the annual total reference et was summed for all stations inclusive of winter months in order to better reflect the total water availability on a regional scale and because growing season for all crops do not coincide this ratio of actual to reference et is the fraction of annual evaporative demand that is actually consumed through evaporation it is similar but not the same as crop coefficients that are typically used in estimating daily crop water requirements quality control was assumed for the available reference et data allen 1996 palmer and hamel 2009 maps of reference et were then generated for the entire eastern snake plain in each year 2009 2018 the annual station total reference et was interpolated spatially using an ordinary kriging method in the gis software with all station data available in each year used to generate the corresponding map all cultivated areas considered in this study are located in relatively flat topography along the snake river plain with few large topographic blocking features such as internal mountain ranges in absence of any other general regional patterns the smooth continuous interpolation generated by ordinary kriging was considered sufficiently representative of spatial trends in reference et ershadi et al 2013 huntington et al 2016 kirchengast et al 2014 yorgey et al 2017 the interpolated reference et rasters and actual eta rasters were then used to calculate maps of the ratio of actual to reference et and are designated subsequently as eta etr yield and crop area data were obtained

production yield per acre acres planted and acres harvested statistics were downloaded for the following crops alfalfa hay spring and winter wheat malting barley sugar beets potatoes and corn crop yield records were imported directly into matlab usda nass also publishes spatial data describing specific crop area allocations bailey and boryan 2010 rasters of crop area designations were obtained

were represented in the majority of years 2009 2019 in the majority of the 21 counties so these three crops were selected for further analysis cropscape layers were used to conditionally sample i e mask the eta and eta etr rasters by the designated area of each crop to obtain a map of the consumptive water use and et ratio for each crop the zonal statistics tool was then used in the qgis to calculate the mean median and standard deviation of eta for all pixels within each county boundary the resulting statistics of consumptive water use for each combination of crop county and year were imported into matlab for further analysis 2 2 water productivity analysis consumptive water use eta the ratio eta etr and yield per acre statistics were collated in matlab which was used to perform unit conversions to calculate derivative statistics and to plot data for this study water productivity is narrowly defined as yield per cultivated area per volume of water consumed eta data were reported in depth annual total in millimeters yield per area was reported in tons acre for alfalfa bushels per acre for wheat and barley 60 us lbs per wheat bushel 48 us lbs per barley bushel to equate the different crops all units were converted to report wp in kilograms dry yield per hectare per cubic meter water consumed kgyield ha 1 met 3 in graphical presentation of the data isolines depicting wp for constant yield are shown to indicate a stationary process in which wp decreases in proportion to increasing water consumption these isolines allow the reader to discriminate interannual and spatial trends over years and locations with different weather and water availability 3 results and discussion as defined here water productivity is a function of yield and consumptive water use from the perspective of maximizing production one strategy to improve wp is to increase yield however the relationship between yield and wp is not equally linear for the three crops studied for county averaged wheat production fig 2 wp generally increases linearly with yield this trend is also clearly defined for barley fig 3 although there is a significant departure from the constant yield assumption in camas county where yields were less than 2000 kg ha 1 in the case of alfalfa a linear trend is apparent for yields greater than 10 000 kg ha 1 but there is no clear relationship at lower amounts of yield cases where data points exceed the linear yield wp relationship indicate that production is outperforming an expectation of maintaining yield under reduced water consumption the results in fig 4 indicate that alfalfa production sometimes exhibits increased water productivity when water application is limited evaluating wp with respect to et can clarify when and how this phenomena changes over time if yields are held constant with decreasing eta water productivity effectively increases this might occur incrementally if actual et is reduced by deficit irrigation or it might happen over the course of a growing season when the irrigation is curtailed mid season although precision irrigation methods are designed to maintain yields while reducing water use yields necessarily decline as actual et approaches a minimum required for photosynthesis and drought stress increases reduced irrigation increases the risk of yield reduction in any given year especially if the shortfall occurs early in crop development but water limitations are not equally damaging for all crops and at all times throughout the season for example alfalfa is harvested repeatedly throughout the season 2 4 cuttings annually are typical in the eastern snake plain so strategic irrigation in the early season can maximize production with however much water is available as a result even if irrigation is limited in any given year alfalfa can generate the greatest potential yields possible from the water available for irrigation in these cases any incremental and late season eta is effectively eliminated and wp is maximized fig 5 similarly the flexibility of various combinations of winter and spring wheat grown with or without supplemental irrigation is evident in the range of eta values seen in fig 6 with some part of any given year s wheat crop planted in winter or spring soil water is recharged in the winter boosting yields for irrigated and dryland production alike the combination of irrigated and dryland wheat also contributes to increased water productivity in contrast barley is the least flexible of these three crops and the relatively high level of investment required to irrigate barley may prevent further gains in wp plotting water productivity with respect to eta figs 5 6 and 7 reveals differences in the patterns of consumptive use in alfalfa wheat and barley across a range of regional differences in irrigation and water availability in each figure the counties with the largest area planted to each crop are plotted indicated in the legends in descending order of planted area for alfalfa fig 5 clustering of wp for counties with eta averaging 700 1000 mm annually suggests a crop water requirement that maximizes production for counties with higher eta rates the trends within each county suggest that wp drops faster than expected compared to the isolines of constant yield for example the trend of wp for twin falls blue triangles is much shallower than the nearest isolines indicating that wp does not increase with decreasing eta as much as constant yield would suggest on the other hand wp in the three counties with eta consistently less than 700 mm year camas oneida and bannock follow or exceed a trend suggested by constant yield in particular wp in camas county is highly variable suggesting that annual eta less than 500 mm is associated with increased risk of low yields another way of interpreting this is that alfalfa production can sometimes outperform the constant yield expectation when less water is available in contrast to alfalfa fig 6 shows wheat wp is optimal when eta is between 500 mm and 800 mm fig 6 without the variability observed at lower eta seen with alfalfa the interannual trends for each individual county closely match the isolines with the exception of cassia county for barley optimal wp is indicated in a narrower range of 600 700 mm annual eta fig 7 trends in barley wp for most individual counties mostly follow the constant yield isolines with possible exceptions of jerome and caribou counties a limited number of yield reports from some counties limits the interpretation of interannual trends unlike barley alfalfa is often grown at field margins such as in the corners of center pivots and irrigated with lower cost irrigation systems such as flood and hand move sprinklers as a result some of the observed gains in wp may have resulted from improving irrigation efficiency or from shifting alfalfa production from marginal areas to center pivot irrigation with better application uniformity it should be noted that the higher wp values for alfalfa 1 2 kg ha 1 m 3 as opposed to those observed in wheat and barley 0 5 1 5 kg ha 1 m 3 reflect that alfalfa hay includes all dry matter production while barley and wheat yields only include harvest grain weight figs 8 9 and 10 use the wp data and isolines to visualize how wp changes over time fig 8 shows trends in alfalfa wp for three counties with individual data points labeled by year in the case of camas county noted in fig 5 for highly variable wp it is evident that wp in 2016 and 2018 is much higher than previous seasons this can be attributed to higher yield since the highest wp value in 2016 occurs when eta is in the middle of that county s observed range of 250 500 mm this may be indicative of improved irrigation methods better utilization or timing in harvests or some other improved agronomic practice in contrast there is no clear directional trend for alfalfa wp in jefferson county although wp generally increases with lower eta it does not match the constant yield isoline and indicates that wp gains may be limited for areas with water consumption at the upper end of the observed range alfalfa wp trends in bonneville county approximately follow the constant yield isolines these kinds of observations should be verified by local water managers and irrigators to identify how irrigation practices may be linked to the observed changes in wp over time for wheat and barley trends in wp changes generally follow the isolines figs 9 and 10 the change in wheat wp from 2015 to 2016 in oneida county suggests that management may be improving wp more than a constant yield would suggest this kind of trend merits ongoing evaluation to verify if new management or water prioritization is a long term positive trend similarly barley wp in minidoka county increased in 2018 and 2019 over that expected by the constant yield isolines in order to control for the influence of weather across the eastern snake plain region and between years wp for each crop are plotted against the fraction of evaporative demand i e eta etr shown in figs 11 12 and 13 normalizing by reference et clarifies the differences between the three crops for alfalfa the two driest counties camas and oneida annual eta falls below 50 of reference et in all years and is usually below 25 of reference et fig 11 in the other five counties where eta is between 50 and 70 of the annual total reference et alfalfa wp is clustered around 1 1 5 kg ha 1 m 3 in counties with less water available alfalfa yield is lower and wp can drop below 1 kg ha 1 m 3 but in limited cases exceeds 1 7 kg ha 1 m 3 by calculating wp in terms of water consumption it is evident that marginal alfalfa production can exceed wp in counties with more readily available water supply it is worth noting again that because this ratio compares the actual and reference et totals for the entire year more time spent when crop et is reduced contributes to reducing the eta etr fraction for alfalfa this may be periods between harvests when canopy is regrowing and in dry years eta may be greatly decreased by early drought induced dormancy both wheat and barley indicate similar optimal water consumption rates with regard to reference et with an average annual eta 50 55 of reference et while greater amounts of eta correspond to higher yield these data suggest there is an optimal level of irrigation which maximizes water productivity optimizing production per unit water consumed is particularly relevant during drought or when water supply is curtailed for wheat and barley figs 12 and 13 wp greater than 1 kg ha 1 m 3 is only observed when eta exceeds 40 of reference et when reduced water supply is anticipated irrigation amounts and scheduling can be reallocated to those crops which are the most productive for the available water supply the resultant wp quantifies beneficial use on a per acre basis using readily available local predictions of monthly reference et the eta etr ratio provides a straightforward and objective definition of minimum crop water requirement and optimal allocation for any location throughout the growing season at the scale of local water management and for individual farm operations plotting the wp of individual crops quantifies how productivity changes while controlling for interannual variability in water availability and weather the range of the wp at the lower end of eta observed in the semi arid eastern snake plain region indicates that while yield will be reduced when water shortages occur productivity on the basis of water consumption may actually increase especially in areas and crops with which marginal production can be prioritized clearly defined clustering and peaks in the wp plot as shown for barley help identify a minimum crop water requirement to optimize productivity alternately crops which demonstrate high productivity across the range of consumed fraction are likely to be adaptable to different regions and when water shortages occur while financial considerations will dictate maximizing yield or market value for a given piece of land wp analysis can project the most productive allocation strategy as water shortages become increasingly prevalent at regional scales calculating wp across many years quantifies the changes resulting from resource allocation and curtailment decisions quantifying wp provides a single metric that combines information about productivity water consumption and interannual changes that respond to management decisions projecting an assumption such as constant yield shown as isolines in figs 5 10 provides objective assessment criteria across various locations crop types and over time although this study only compared productivity for three crops aggregated by counties this same analysis could be applied equally well in other applications examples of specific applications that are critical in managing water resources include quantifying differences between groundwater and surface water irrigated fields in wp and consumptive water use singh 2014 differentiating productivity among places of use designated by senior and junior water rights grantham and viers 2014 re analyzing soil productivity classification based on observation of actual consumptive use rather than depending on water use efficiency measures grafton et al 2018 calculating wp with this method can be applied using economic water productivity income per land area caloric or nutritional water productivity or other quantitative measures of beneficial use economic water productivity in particular is a useful tool for predicting changes in land use chance et al 2018 inform better crop insurance practices barnett and mahul 2007 and to advise growers considering replanting to more resilient or more valuable crops yorgey et al 2017 in particular decisions to replant fields from annual to perennial crops would benefit farm planning as evidenced by shifts in acres planted to orchard crops such as almonds arellano gonzalez and moore 2020 there is a widespread perception that production of water intensive crops could shift from regions with limited and overallocated water supply such as california s san joaquin valley to areas with an abundance of water for irrigation such oregon s willamette valley or idaho s snake plain leaving aside the role of regulatory and legal oversight water managers still need tools to consider the practical definition of beneficial use and to quantify how specific decisions on water allocation will generate measurable benefits particularly as water demand outstrips supply an honest evaluation of water productivity requires a quantitative framework that controls for interannual variability weather influences and regional differences the simple analyses shown here demonstrate that publicly available data can readily quantify beneficial use of water resources for entire regions 4 conclusions while these data do not exhibit consistent trends in reduced water consumption or yield for the period 2009 2019 evaluating water productivity allows some conclusions to be drawn regarding trends in irrigated farming on the eastern snake plain consumptive water use generally declined for most crops following the 2015 agreement between groundwater and surface users and this was reflected in higher wp for all crops in the years 2016 2019 at least for alfalfa wheat and barley any concurrent reduction in yield was minimal confirmed by the general increase in wp however for those counties where the majority of fields are well watered the increase in wp was less than would be expected by a constant yield assumption in drier counties a dramatic increase in water productivity was noted especially for alfalfa production however it remains to be seen if these trends will persist increasing drought conditions especially in spring 2021 may test of the lower limit of productivity in these areas where water supply is uncertain and limited the simplified water productivity metric presented above utilizes remotely sensed maps of actual evapotranspiration and public crop yield records aggregated at the county level the combination of these data allows a statistical interrogation of interannual trends and some semi quantitative comparison between different geographic areas within irrigated areas of the eastern snake plain the demonstrated water productivity methodology can be directly applied in any geographic area where both aggregated yield records and consumptive water use estimates are available the simplified water productivity metric allows water managers to readily interpret remotely sensed typically satellite based data and could be a valuable guide for long term resource management at regional and hydrologic basin scales this methodology can be readily adapted to analyze the role of other factors in shifting water productivity

9576,water productivity of crops must be increased to meet global demand for farm products while conserving limited water resources throughout the western united states highly productive agricultural regions face more frequent and severe droughts and must allocate limited water resources among competing uses irrigated agriculture accounts for the majority of consumptive water use and has a proportionately important role in managing water shortage water productivity accounting helps inform objective decision making regarding these allocations at the regional local and farm scales publicly available data from several government agencies were re analyzed and combined to quantify interannual changes in consumptive water use water productivity was determined using county level crop survey data satellite based maps of evapotranspiration and weather records for 21 counties located in the eastern snake plain in the us state of idaho for nine years during the period 2009 2019 changes in water productivity over this period suggest trends that correspond to crop specific irrigation practices interannual variability in water supply and regional attempts to curtail water consumption and improve water use efficiency results indicate that at regional scales water productivity for alfalfa can increase despite or as a result of water limited conditions increasing from 0 5 to 1 75 kg ha 1 m 3 in some individual counties over the 10 year period which may indicate increasingly efficient water use water productivity of barley and wheat crops also varied year to year but did not demonstrate clear independence from total water consumption instead irrigated areas and crops with adequate water supply follow a general trend of increased yield with increased water consumption and the resulting water productivity approximately follows a linear function of actual evapotranspiration keywords water allocation regional planning quantifying consumptive water use crop irrigation requirements groundwater management 1 introduction sustainable development goals at regional national and international levels all indicate that agricultural production must be maintained or increased while consuming fewer resources cai et al 2011 tilman et al 2002 in water limited regions this implies that water productivity wp needs to increase in one of two ways wp increases because greater yields are obtained using the same water allocation or wp increases by sustaining the same crop yield with reduced water application bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 molden et al 2010 trout et al 2020 depleted aquifers increased regulation of water resources and competition between water use sectors all motivate irrigators to reduce irrigation and use available water strategically jovanovic et al 2020 qin et al 2019 increasingly frequent droughts curtailment of water rights access and perennial uncertainty about water availability contribute to greater competition among water usage sectors arellano gonzalez and moore 2020 medellín azuara et al 2016 irrigators and water managers are under pressure to achieve greater water use efficiency mitigate drought and groundwater overdraft and manage cross sector competition for water resources owen 2014 in order to support these monumental tasks a relevant and practical measure of water productivity is needed to guide water allocation strategies and to evaluate conservation measures a major challenge in quantifying wp is the collection of accurate and extensive data on yield and agricultural water use in the united states crop yields are typically reported on a county basis for major crops and made available through the national agriculture statistics service usda nass this coverage is not completely comprehensive because data are solicited through self reporting surveys aggregation of survey data must be sufficient to ensure anonymity of individual producers and because of practical and budgetary constraints on the extensive nature of these surveys boryan et al 2011 similarly water consumption is also reported by water managers to state agencies such as water resources departments who are mandated to balance pre existing water rights with long term sustainability escriva bou et al 2016 water information is almost invariably reported on the basis of diversion the amount of water removed from surface or ground water supply and is almost never reported in terms of the actual water consumed water is consumed by evaporation from reservoirs lakes and vegetation and this quantity of water is no longer available for beneficial uses including ancillary environmental services in regions with extensive irrigated agriculture the largest portion of consumed water is crop evapotranspiration etc accounting for more than 80 of all consumptive use globally qin et al 2019 siebert and döll 2010 water diversion records cannot directly account for inefficient distribution systems that effectively return some quantity of water to regional storage through run off and infiltration despite this diagnostic approaches to reduce water consumption have focused on increasing water use efficiency and rely on mitigating water losses from distribution and application clemmens and molden 2007 evans and sadler 2008 knox et al 2012 focusing on efficiency alone does not address the central problems of managing limited water supply contor and taylor 2013 grafton et al 2018 perry et al 2009 especially at the scale of managing region water supply kliskey et al 2019 ryu et al 2012 senay et al 2017 furthermore more efficient irrigation systems can increase risk of crop failure and reduce yield trout et al 2020 while precision irrigation strategies may sometimes increase actual water consumption contor and taylor 2013 grafton et al 2018 perry et al 2009 estimates of consumptive use are also critically important in regions which depend on dwindling groundwater resources ghosh et al 2014 tuthill jr et al 2013 application losses such as deep infiltration can contribute significantly to groundwater recharge and intermittent surface storage singh 2014 while difficult to quantify the return flows resulting from irrigation inefficiency often play an important role in meeting interannual water needs within a local area through soil water storage and by meeting non irrigation water requirements the complex and interconnected nature of water resource management necessitate a measure of water productivity that accounts for actual consumption and specifically must quantify the amount of water lost through crop transpiration and soil evaporation significant efforts were made over the past century to develop methods to quantify actual crop irrigation requirements based on consumptive use in order to schedule irrigation and apply water at the same rate as lost through et gowda et al 2016 hargreaves 1994 for many years the predominant technical method to quantify actual crop water requirements has been standardized reference et equations which utilize local weather monitoring and calibrated crop coefficients for individual crops grown in a region droogers and allen 2002 irmak et al 2003 jensen and allen 2016 increasingly information about the actual et eta is available through models based on satellite images of surface color and temperature anderson et al 2012 blankenau et al 2020 blatchford et al 2019 melton et al 2012 used in conjunction with surface weather observations these remote sensing models effectively provide a map of actual et across the entire land surface with a special focus on crop water management several researchers have demonstrated applications which modeled crop yields to estimate water productivity and crop water stress at regional scales cai and sharma 2010 calera et al 2017 campos et al 2018 xue et al 2017 however estimating crop yields by modeling requires substantial effort and technical skills in order to correctly calibrate models and validate against observed data as a result these kinds of modeling applications will always be limited by the budget and technical labor resources available to those state agencies tasked with regulating water resources and irrigation bailey and boryan 2010 calera et al 2017 prokopy et al 2017 another approach to estimate wp can be achieved by combining remote sensing data with ground based yield records without requiring predictive models this simpler approach is chiefly limited by the availability of yield and remote sensing data several researchers have demonstrated the use of local yield data to calculate wp ahmed et al 2010 li et al 2017 el marsafawy et al 2018 wang et al 2018 however the reliability of wp estimates depends on the consistency and accuracy of crop yield data the availability of high resolution commercial satellite imagery may suggest that eta can be estimated at sub field spatial scales however similarly high resolution yield data is difficult to obtain in the united states readily available crop surveys provide annual yield data that are aggregated at county and state levels water productivity calculated from this aggregated yield data and remotely sensed eta can shed light on interannual trends occurring in these sub regional areas the eastern snake plain esp is located within the greater the columbia river basin in southeast idaho usa and is

made overall resource allocation decisions are made by idaho s department of water resources but in practice smaller entities such as canal companies and groundwater districts play an important role in seasonal and day to day management the second goal is to assess annual changes in wp for the decade 2009 2019 major changes to water policy and planning are implemented on annual timeframes and this decade 2009 2019 brackets the period around an agreement made in 2015 between surface water and groundwater users to limit groundwater pumping the third study goal is to control for the effect of interannual variability in weather and evaporative demand on wp finally this study combines published data which are readily available to water managers and demonstrates that relatively simple tools can be used to identify trends and changes in wp these tools can provide practical and quantitative information and guide water resource planning the spatial extent and resolution of the analysis was constrained by the availability of the required data crop survey data is aggregated at the county level and maps of modeled actual et are available for the entire eastern snake plain in nine years during the period 2009 2019 fig 1 2 methods water productivity was calculated from yield records and evapotranspiration totals available in public data sources county level yield statistics for alfalfa wheat and barley are available for the majority of the 21 eastern snake plain counties in each of the years investigated tabulated and published by usda nass yield data were obtained from the nass database and crop area maps were obtained from the nass cropscape layers water productivity was calculated for the years 2009 2010 2011 2013 2015 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 which are the years for which eta maps were published by the idaho department of water resources daily reference et data were obtained from the bureau of reclamation usbr agrimet network inclusive of all weather stations on the eastern snake plain and used to generate an interpolated map of annual total reference et all spatial data were processed using qgis software version 3 16 6 open source geospatial foundation

consumptive water use cwu data were obtained as gridded maps of actual evapotranspiration eta from the idaho department of water resources idwr map and gis data hub https data idwr opendata arcgis com

the metric model uses landsat images of apparent surface temperature infrared thermal which are rescaled from a native 60 or 100 m spatial resolution in post processing to a 30 m output resolution combined with supporting ground based information the metric model calculates eta by determining spatial variability of sensible heat flux and latent heat flux for an entire landsat scene image and calibrating each scene with hot and cold pixels corresponding to areas with low and high et rates respectively allen et al 2011 2007 anderson et al 2012 the idwr data are trained model outputs

morton et al 2013 following the study goal of using publicly available data the metric maps were used as published without further accuracy assessment daily reference et data were used to normalize actual et maps and control for interannual and regional variability in crop water requirements time series of daily reference et were obtained from the usbr agrimet data portal https www usbr gov pn agrimet accessed may 2021 from 18 weather stations located throughout the eastern snake plain eleven of these stations reported for the entire period 2009 2019 records from the other seven stations were available from 2014 to 2019 the annual total reference et was summed for all stations inclusive of winter months in order to better reflect the total water availability on a regional scale and because growing season for all crops do not coincide this ratio of actual to reference et is the fraction of annual evaporative demand that is actually consumed through evaporation it is similar but not the same as crop coefficients that are typically used in estimating daily crop water requirements quality control was assumed for the available reference et data allen 1996 palmer and hamel 2009 maps of reference et were then generated for the entire eastern snake plain in each year 2009 2018 the annual station total reference et was interpolated spatially using an ordinary kriging method in the gis software with all station data available in each year used to generate the corresponding map all cultivated areas considered in this study are located in relatively flat topography along the snake river plain with few large topographic blocking features such as internal mountain ranges in absence of any other general regional patterns the smooth continuous interpolation generated by ordinary kriging was considered sufficiently representative of spatial trends in reference et ershadi et al 2013 huntington et al 2016 kirchengast et al 2014 yorgey et al 2017 the interpolated reference et rasters and actual eta rasters were then used to calculate maps of the ratio of actual to reference et and are designated subsequently as eta etr yield and crop area data were obtained

production yield per acre acres planted and acres harvested statistics were downloaded for the following crops alfalfa hay spring and winter wheat malting barley sugar beets potatoes and corn crop yield records were imported directly into matlab usda nass also publishes spatial data describing specific crop area allocations bailey and boryan 2010 rasters of crop area designations were obtained

were represented in the majority of years 2009 2019 in the majority of the 21 counties so these three crops were selected for further analysis cropscape layers were used to conditionally sample i e mask the eta and eta etr rasters by the designated area of each crop to obtain a map of the consumptive water use and et ratio for each crop the zonal statistics tool was then used in the qgis to calculate the mean median and standard deviation of eta for all pixels within each county boundary the resulting statistics of consumptive water use for each combination of crop county and year were imported into matlab for further analysis 2 2 water productivity analysis consumptive water use eta the ratio eta etr and yield per acre statistics were collated in matlab which was used to perform unit conversions to calculate derivative statistics and to plot data for this study water productivity is narrowly defined as yield per cultivated area per volume of water consumed eta data were reported in depth annual total in millimeters yield per area was reported in tons acre for alfalfa bushels per acre for wheat and barley 60 us lbs per wheat bushel 48 us lbs per barley bushel to equate the different crops all units were converted to report wp in kilograms dry yield per hectare per cubic meter water consumed kgyield ha 1 met 3 in graphical presentation of the data isolines depicting wp for constant yield are shown to indicate a stationary process in which wp decreases in proportion to increasing water consumption these isolines allow the reader to discriminate interannual and spatial trends over years and locations with different weather and water availability 3 results and discussion as defined here water productivity is a function of yield and consumptive water use from the perspective of maximizing production one strategy to improve wp is to increase yield however the relationship between yield and wp is not equally linear for the three crops studied for county averaged wheat production fig 2 wp generally increases linearly with yield this trend is also clearly defined for barley fig 3 although there is a significant departure from the constant yield assumption in camas county where yields were less than 2000 kg ha 1 in the case of alfalfa a linear trend is apparent for yields greater than 10 000 kg ha 1 but there is no clear relationship at lower amounts of yield cases where data points exceed the linear yield wp relationship indicate that production is outperforming an expectation of maintaining yield under reduced water consumption the results in fig 4 indicate that alfalfa production sometimes exhibits increased water productivity when water application is limited evaluating wp with respect to et can clarify when and how this phenomena changes over time if yields are held constant with decreasing eta water productivity effectively increases this might occur incrementally if actual et is reduced by deficit irrigation or it might happen over the course of a growing season when the irrigation is curtailed mid season although precision irrigation methods are designed to maintain yields while reducing water use yields necessarily decline as actual et approaches a minimum required for photosynthesis and drought stress increases reduced irrigation increases the risk of yield reduction in any given year especially if the shortfall occurs early in crop development but water limitations are not equally damaging for all crops and at all times throughout the season for example alfalfa is harvested repeatedly throughout the season 2 4 cuttings annually are typical in the eastern snake plain so strategic irrigation in the early season can maximize production with however much water is available as a result even if irrigation is limited in any given year alfalfa can generate the greatest potential yields possible from the water available for irrigation in these cases any incremental and late season eta is effectively eliminated and wp is maximized fig 5 similarly the flexibility of various combinations of winter and spring wheat grown with or without supplemental irrigation is evident in the range of eta values seen in fig 6 with some part of any given year s wheat crop planted in winter or spring soil water is recharged in the winter boosting yields for irrigated and dryland production alike the combination of irrigated and dryland wheat also contributes to increased water productivity in contrast barley is the least flexible of these three crops and the relatively high level of investment required to irrigate barley may prevent further gains in wp plotting water productivity with respect to eta figs 5 6 and 7 reveals differences in the patterns of consumptive use in alfalfa wheat and barley across a range of regional differences in irrigation and water availability in each figure the counties with the largest area planted to each crop are plotted indicated in the legends in descending order of planted area for alfalfa fig 5 clustering of wp for counties with eta averaging 700 1000 mm annually suggests a crop water requirement that maximizes production for counties with higher eta rates the trends within each county suggest that wp drops faster than expected compared to the isolines of constant yield for example the trend of wp for twin falls blue triangles is much shallower than the nearest isolines indicating that wp does not increase with decreasing eta as much as constant yield would suggest on the other hand wp in the three counties with eta consistently less than 700 mm year camas oneida and bannock follow or exceed a trend suggested by constant yield in particular wp in camas county is highly variable suggesting that annual eta less than 500 mm is associated with increased risk of low yields another way of interpreting this is that alfalfa production can sometimes outperform the constant yield expectation when less water is available in contrast to alfalfa fig 6 shows wheat wp is optimal when eta is between 500 mm and 800 mm fig 6 without the variability observed at lower eta seen with alfalfa the interannual trends for each individual county closely match the isolines with the exception of cassia county for barley optimal wp is indicated in a narrower range of 600 700 mm annual eta fig 7 trends in barley wp for most individual counties mostly follow the constant yield isolines with possible exceptions of jerome and caribou counties a limited number of yield reports from some counties limits the interpretation of interannual trends unlike barley alfalfa is often grown at field margins such as in the corners of center pivots and irrigated with lower cost irrigation systems such as flood and hand move sprinklers as a result some of the observed gains in wp may have resulted from improving irrigation efficiency or from shifting alfalfa production from marginal areas to center pivot irrigation with better application uniformity it should be noted that the higher wp values for alfalfa 1 2 kg ha 1 m 3 as opposed to those observed in wheat and barley 0 5 1 5 kg ha 1 m 3 reflect that alfalfa hay includes all dry matter production while barley and wheat yields only include harvest grain weight figs 8 9 and 10 use the wp data and isolines to visualize how wp changes over time fig 8 shows trends in alfalfa wp for three counties with individual data points labeled by year in the case of camas county noted in fig 5 for highly variable wp it is evident that wp in 2016 and 2018 is much higher than previous seasons this can be attributed to higher yield since the highest wp value in 2016 occurs when eta is in the middle of that county s observed range of 250 500 mm this may be indicative of improved irrigation methods better utilization or timing in harvests or some other improved agronomic practice in contrast there is no clear directional trend for alfalfa wp in jefferson county although wp generally increases with lower eta it does not match the constant yield isoline and indicates that wp gains may be limited for areas with water consumption at the upper end of the observed range alfalfa wp trends in bonneville county approximately follow the constant yield isolines these kinds of observations should be verified by local water managers and irrigators to identify how irrigation practices may be linked to the observed changes in wp over time for wheat and barley trends in wp changes generally follow the isolines figs 9 and 10 the change in wheat wp from 2015 to 2016 in oneida county suggests that management may be improving wp more than a constant yield would suggest this kind of trend merits ongoing evaluation to verify if new management or water prioritization is a long term positive trend similarly barley wp in minidoka county increased in 2018 and 2019 over that expected by the constant yield isolines in order to control for the influence of weather across the eastern snake plain region and between years wp for each crop are plotted against the fraction of evaporative demand i e eta etr shown in figs 11 12 and 13 normalizing by reference et clarifies the differences between the three crops for alfalfa the two driest counties camas and oneida annual eta falls below 50 of reference et in all years and is usually below 25 of reference et fig 11 in the other five counties where eta is between 50 and 70 of the annual total reference et alfalfa wp is clustered around 1 1 5 kg ha 1 m 3 in counties with less water available alfalfa yield is lower and wp can drop below 1 kg ha 1 m 3 but in limited cases exceeds 1 7 kg ha 1 m 3 by calculating wp in terms of water consumption it is evident that marginal alfalfa production can exceed wp in counties with more readily available water supply it is worth noting again that because this ratio compares the actual and reference et totals for the entire year more time spent when crop et is reduced contributes to reducing the eta etr fraction for alfalfa this may be periods between harvests when canopy is regrowing and in dry years eta may be greatly decreased by early drought induced dormancy both wheat and barley indicate similar optimal water consumption rates with regard to reference et with an average annual eta 50 55 of reference et while greater amounts of eta correspond to higher yield these data suggest there is an optimal level of irrigation which maximizes water productivity optimizing production per unit water consumed is particularly relevant during drought or when water supply is curtailed for wheat and barley figs 12 and 13 wp greater than 1 kg ha 1 m 3 is only observed when eta exceeds 40 of reference et when reduced water supply is anticipated irrigation amounts and scheduling can be reallocated to those crops which are the most productive for the available water supply the resultant wp quantifies beneficial use on a per acre basis using readily available local predictions of monthly reference et the eta etr ratio provides a straightforward and objective definition of minimum crop water requirement and optimal allocation for any location throughout the growing season at the scale of local water management and for individual farm operations plotting the wp of individual crops quantifies how productivity changes while controlling for interannual variability in water availability and weather the range of the wp at the lower end of eta observed in the semi arid eastern snake plain region indicates that while yield will be reduced when water shortages occur productivity on the basis of water consumption may actually increase especially in areas and crops with which marginal production can be prioritized clearly defined clustering and peaks in the wp plot as shown for barley help identify a minimum crop water requirement to optimize productivity alternately crops which demonstrate high productivity across the range of consumed fraction are likely to be adaptable to different regions and when water shortages occur while financial considerations will dictate maximizing yield or market value for a given piece of land wp analysis can project the most productive allocation strategy as water shortages become increasingly prevalent at regional scales calculating wp across many years quantifies the changes resulting from resource allocation and curtailment decisions quantifying wp provides a single metric that combines information about productivity water consumption and interannual changes that respond to management decisions projecting an assumption such as constant yield shown as isolines in figs 5 10 provides objective assessment criteria across various locations crop types and over time although this study only compared productivity for three crops aggregated by counties this same analysis could be applied equally well in other applications examples of specific applications that are critical in managing water resources include quantifying differences between groundwater and surface water irrigated fields in wp and consumptive water use singh 2014 differentiating productivity among places of use designated by senior and junior water rights grantham and viers 2014 re analyzing soil productivity classification based on observation of actual consumptive use rather than depending on water use efficiency measures grafton et al 2018 calculating wp with this method can be applied using economic water productivity income per land area caloric or nutritional water productivity or other quantitative measures of beneficial use economic water productivity in particular is a useful tool for predicting changes in land use chance et al 2018 inform better crop insurance practices barnett and mahul 2007 and to advise growers considering replanting to more resilient or more valuable crops yorgey et al 2017 in particular decisions to replant fields from annual to perennial crops would benefit farm planning as evidenced by shifts in acres planted to orchard crops such as almonds arellano gonzalez and moore 2020 there is a widespread perception that production of water intensive crops could shift from regions with limited and overallocated water supply such as california s san joaquin valley to areas with an abundance of water for irrigation such oregon s willamette valley or idaho s snake plain leaving aside the role of regulatory and legal oversight water managers still need tools to consider the practical definition of beneficial use and to quantify how specific decisions on water allocation will generate measurable benefits particularly as water demand outstrips supply an honest evaluation of water productivity requires a quantitative framework that controls for interannual variability weather influences and regional differences the simple analyses shown here demonstrate that publicly available data can readily quantify beneficial use of water resources for entire regions 4 conclusions while these data do not exhibit consistent trends in reduced water consumption or yield for the period 2009 2019 evaluating water productivity allows some conclusions to be drawn regarding trends in irrigated farming on the eastern snake plain consumptive water use generally declined for most crops following the 2015 agreement between groundwater and surface users and this was reflected in higher wp for all crops in the years 2016 2019 at least for alfalfa wheat and barley any concurrent reduction in yield was minimal confirmed by the general increase in wp however for those counties where the majority of fields are well watered the increase in wp was less than would be expected by a constant yield assumption in drier counties a dramatic increase in water productivity was noted especially for alfalfa production however it remains to be seen if these trends will persist increasing drought conditions especially in spring 2021 may test of the lower limit of productivity in these areas where water supply is uncertain and limited the simplified water productivity metric presented above utilizes remotely sensed maps of actual evapotranspiration and public crop yield records aggregated at the county level the combination of these data allows a statistical interrogation of interannual trends and some semi quantitative comparison between different geographic areas within irrigated areas of the eastern snake plain the demonstrated water productivity methodology can be directly applied in any geographic area where both aggregated yield records and consumptive water use estimates are available the simplified water productivity metric allows water managers to readily interpret remotely sensed typically satellite based data and could be a valuable guide for long term resource management at regional and hydrologic basin scales this methodology can be readily adapted to analyze the role of other factors in shifting water productivity

9577,irrigation is the most impacting and uncertain human intervention on the water resource the possibility of retrieving information on irrigation practices through remote sensing technology opens unprecedented perspectives on the monitoring of anthropized basins this study is aimed at assessing the impact of different approaches to model the contribution of the evapotranspiration in retrieving the amounts of water applied for irrigation through a soil moisture based sm based inversion algorithm such a contribution is conclusive especially over semi arid regions three modeling approaches relying on both calculated and remotely sensed actual and potential evapotranspiration et and pet data sets were implemented to represent the evapotranspiration rate within the sm based inversion method which allows backward estimation of irrigation through the soil water balance inversion by combining the different evapotranspiration data sources and modeling approaches seven experiments aimed at inverting dispatch disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change downscaled smap soil moisture active passive soil moisture at 1 km to estimate irrigation over four heavily irrigated agricultural districts located in spain aragon and catalonia were compared the results highlighted that the application of the fao56 guidelines parametrization relying on the use of optical data as proposed by the authors in a previous study remains the most reliable configuration in fact the implementation of a simplified approach not considering the transpiration component of the specific crop led to irrigation underestimates finally it is interesting to note that the application of the method with remotely sensed et from modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer produced reliable district aggregated irrigation estimates thus opening the perspective of an algorithm configuration forced with remote sensing data only graphical abstract ga1 keywords irrigation amounts remote sensing soil water content actual evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration water balance inversion 1 introduction irrigation is widely recognized as the main driver of water availability dynamics over anthropized basins wada et al 2014 more than 70 of global surface and sub surface water withdrawals are attributable to irrigation foley et al 2011 in some countries the rates of water depletions linked to such practices reach percentages up to 90 of the available freshwater gleick et al 2012 ouaadi et al 2021 during the last decades irrigation allowed a strong intensification of the agricultural production which is expected to be further exacerbated until the limits of the sustainability in the near future because of the combined action of several factors e g climate change population growth and consequent food demand rising living standard and dietary changes ozdogan et al 2010 massari et al 2021b on the basis of the abovementioned considerations it is clear that irrigation represents a human activity whose impact on the natural water cycle is not negligible despite this irrigation dynamics are still highly uncertain worldwide hence any effort towards a rational management of irrigation water seems useless until the following questions keep on remaining mostly unsolved i when and where do irrigation practices actually occur and ii how much water is used for irrigation recently remote sensing technology shed a light on this topic providing observations helpful to develop techniques and methods aimed at answering both questions i and ii the irrigation detection i e timing and mapping through satellite data has been investigated in studies exploiting microwave data gao et al 2018 malbéteau et al 2018 dari et al 2021 2022 optical data

al 2019 zaussinger et al 2019 dari et al 2020 zohaib and choi 2020 zappa et al 2021 data sets have been recently exploited in irrigation estimates studies in particular brocca et al 2018 proposed for the first time an irrigation quantification method based on the inversion of the soil moisture signal such an approach is an evolution of the sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2014 originally developed to estimate rainfall from soil moisture observations i e by using the soil as a natural rain gauge the method was tested with coarse resolution soil moisture data from smap soil moisture active passive smos soil moisture and ocean salinity ascat advanced scatterometer and amsr2 advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 thus highlighting the potential of the method in retrieving irrigation amounts nevertheless limitations due to the low spatial resolution were pointed out jalilvand et al 2019 implemented the sm2rain algorithm to estimate irrigation quantities in iran through amsr2 ascat and smos soil moisture data in that study the not negligible role played by the evapotranspiration term within the algorithm especially in applications over semi arid regions was highlighted on this basis dari et al 2020 further developed the method by implementing the guidelines provided by the fao food and agriculture organization paper n 56 allen et al 1998 within the sm2rain algorithm with the aim of obtaining a better modeling of the evapotranspiration term the algorithm was applied over north east of spain with 1 km resolution dispatch disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change merlin et al 2013 downscaled smos and smap soil moisture satisfactory results in reproducing both irrigation magnitudes and their spatial distributions were obtained nevertheless in literature alternative methods to the sm2rain algorithm and exploiting remotely sensed soil moisture do exist as an example the approach relying on the discrepancies between satellite and modeled soil moisture originally proposed by zaussinger et al 2019 has been recently updated by zappa et al 2021 by including evapotranspiration and drainage losses the method was tested in northern germany with high resolution 500 m soil moisture observations from sentinel 1 an agreement between estimated irrigation spatio temporal dynamics and the benchmark quantified by a mean pearson correlation equal to 0 64 was found finally data assimilation techniques exploiting remote sensing soil moisture data are also used in irrigation quantification studies see e g lievens et al 2017 abolafia rosenzweig et al 2019 modanesi et al 2021b in this work the methodology proposed in dari et al 2020 is further developed more in detail the soil moisture based sm based inversion approach derived by the sm2rain algorithm is tested by implementing the method with evapotranspiration data from multiple sources the main objectives of the study are i to evaluate the loss of accuracy in reproducing the actual irrigation amounts when less data demanding approaches to reproduce the et rates are used and ii to investigate the reliability of a configuration forced with remote sensing data only in order to do this the estimates produced by the experiment exploiting smap soil moisture proposed in dari et al 2020 are compared with results obtained by carrying out six new simulations over the same pilot area each simulation is characterized by a different configuration adopted to model the evapotranspiration contribution not negligible in this kind of applications several potential and actual evapotranspiration henceforth pet and et data sets derived from the penman monteith allen et al 1998 and hargreaves hargreaves and samani 1982 1985 methods or from modis moderate resolution imaging

soil moisture observations retrieved by the smap satellite and disaggregated through the dispatch algorithm at the spatial resolution of 1 km were exploited in the performed experiments smap is a nasa national aeronautics and spatial administration mission launched at the beginning of 2015 originally the smap equipment was designed to retrieve surface soil moisture measurements at three different spatial resolutions 36 km 9 km and 3 km through the synergy between an l band radar 1 26 ghz and an l band radiometer 1 4 ghz nevertheless the premature failure of the radar determined the impossibility of delivering the 3 km product until the replacement of smap radar derived data with sentinel 1a sentinel 1b sar derived observations das et al 2019 the data set used in this study is a 1 km product obtained by disaggregating the 36 km version through the dispatch downscaling algorithm the method allows to redistribute the high resolution soil moisture within the pixel of the coarser resolution data in a conservative way i e by maintaining the average value unaltered the disaggregation relies on the link existing between the surface soil moisture and the soil evaporative efficiency see namely the ratio of et to pet in order to compute the see land surface temperature lst and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data at 1 km spatial resolution retrieved by the

al 2008 2017 applied over the iberian peninsula whose output is a gridded product at 5 km spatial resolution and at an hourly time interval the data set is built by interpolating a first guess produced by a numerical weather prediction model with ground measurements in this case ground observed data were taken from the aemet agencia estatal de meteorología network while era interim european reanalysis interim data delivered by the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf were used as a first guess with the only exception of rainfall rate for which aemet data were used in this study meteorological data were both directly used as an input in the sm based inversion algorithm in the case of rainfall rate and exploited to compute pet according to two different formulations safran air relative humidity rainfall rate air temperature wind speed as well as solar radiation from the era 5 reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 were used for this purpose pet rates were calculated according to the penman monteith allen et al 1998 and the hargreaves hargreaves and samani 1982 1985 equations in accordance to the fao food and agricultural organization method allen et al 1998 the original penman monteith formulation penman 1948 monteith 1965 is parametrized as follows 1 pet pm 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 in which δ kpa c indicates the slope of the vapor pressure curve r n mj m2day is the net radiation at the crop surface g mj m2day represents the density of the soil heat flux γ kpa c is the psychrometric constant t c is the daily averaged air temperature at 2 m height u 2 m s indicates the wind speed at 2 m height e s kpa is the saturation vapor pressure and e a kpa is the actual vapor pressure eq 1 relies on the following assumptions a reference grass crop of 12 cm height a fixed albedo equal to 0 23 and a value of the surface resistance equal to 70 s m the hargreaves hargreaves and samani 1982 1985 formula represents an alternative to the penman monteith equation in case of missing weather data i e air relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation it is expressed by 2 pet h 0 0023 t 17 8 t max t min 0 5 r a where t c has the same meaning as above t max c and t min c represent the daily maximum and the daily minimum air temperature at 2 m height respectively and r a mj m2day is the extraterrestrial radiation it is noteworthy that pet data calculated through both approaches described and the meteorological variables used were resampled to the 1 km regular grid adopted in this study and aggregated at a daily time step 3 3 irrigation volumes the benchmark irrigation volumes were deduced by the canals flow data recorded at selected stations of the saih system saih ebro 2021 see fig 1 in particular the stations c081 el ciego and c101 coll de foix along the canal de aragón y cataluña were considered for the northern and southern partitions of the catalan and aragonese district respectively data recorded at the stations c116 cabecera urgell along the canal de urgell and c117 auxiliar urgell along the canal auxiliar de urgell were exploited for the urgell area it is noteworthy that the irrigation data for the urgell district is missing for an 8 months period from july 2016 to february 2017 for this reason an alternative benchmark value for the year 2016 deduced by the hydrological plan of the spanish part of the ebro river basin referring to the period 2015 2021 was considered for the long term comparison all the above mentioned observation sections are located just downstream different reservoirs used to stock water to be delivered to the crops the algerri balaguer district is fed with water pumped directly from the river at the station e271 of the network hence the volumes of water pumped have been considered in this case in order to be compared with satellite derived estimates the benchmark irrigation volumes were converted to equivalent irrigation thicknesses in mm and reduced by considering the losses attributable to the irrigation infrastructure the irrigation doses in mm were obtained by dividing the volumes by the area of each district the losses were assumed equal to the 30 of the gross value for the urgell to the 15 for both partitions of the catalan and aragonese district and to 10 for the algerri balaguer such coefficients were determined on the basis of the prevalent irrigation technique in each district of the age of the infrastructure and of regional studies cots et al 1993 maté et al 1994 causapé et al 2006 for further details about the irrigation infrastructure in the study area the reader is referred to dari et al 2020 3 4 the sm based inversion approach the proposed approach is an evolution of the sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2014 born with the aim of retrieving rainfall from soil moisture observations and later adapted to estimate irrigation brocca et al 2018 recently further improvements have been implemented on the basis of studies highlighting the essential role played by the evapotranspiration contribution in estimating irrigation especially over semi arid areas jalilvand et al 2019 dari et al 2020 the core idea of the method consists in backwards estimating the amount of water entering the soil w in t by inverting the water balance expressed by 3 w in t z dsm t dt g t sr t e t in which z mm indicates the water capacity of the soil layer calculated as the product between the soil layer depth and its porosity dsm t dt represent the variation of relative soil moisture sm t in time t days g t mm day is the drainage rate sr t mm day represents the surface runoff rate and e t mm day is the et rate the g t term is linked to sm t through a power law equation famiglietti and woods 1994 brocca et al 2014 g t asm t b with a mm and b indicating drainage parameters while the sr t contribution is assumed to be negligible previous studies showed that potential residual errors attributable to such an assumption are small brocca et al 2015 jalilvand et al 2019 in this work the same irrigation estimate scheme was repeated several times by implementing different approaches to model the e t term the experiment setting was common to all the simulations in fact the model parameters a b and z were calibrated over the non irrigated area adjacent to the urgell district orange area in panel b of fig 1 over such portion the only external input is the rainfall rate r t mm day hence w in t r t conversely the irrigation estimates were carried out over the irrigated areas where the water entering into the soil is determined by the sum of r t and the irrigation rate irr t mm day summarizing the model parameters were calibrated by estimating the rainfall amounts over the dryland area according to the following equation 4 r t z dsm t dt a sm t b e t and minimizing the root mean square difference between such amounts and the safran rainfall rates then the spatial median values of the distributions of a b and z were used as fixed values for the irrigation estimate step which was carried out over the irrigated districts both calibration and estimate phases were performed by adopting a 5 day temporal aggregation the irrigation amounts were retrieved by applying eq 3 and removing the rainfall signal from the model output according to the following 5 irr t w in t r t it is noteworthy that negative irr t values which are mainly attributable to rainfall simulation errors jalilvand et al 2019 were set equal to zero in the following section the different approaches implemented to reproduce the e t term are described 3 4 1 performed simulations in this work seven different methods to model the e t term in the proposed sm based inversion algorithm were considered thus determining an equal number of irrigation estimates experiments the performed simulations can be grouped in three main categories on the basis of the approach adopted to obtain the et rate the first implemented approach is the fao56 one according to this method the e t term can be calculated as 6 e t k c t pet t with k c t representing the crop coefficient and pet t indicating the pet rate in this study a modeled k c dynamic both in space and time developed through parametrizations based on remotely sensed data was used i e soil moisture ndvi and fcover for further details the reader is referred to appendix a the above mentioned approach was implemented by exploiting pet data from three different sources calculated according to eq 1 to eq 2 and modis derived in the second approach the e t term was modeled as the potential rate limited by the available water content i e by multiplying pet with soil moisture henceforth sm limited approach 7 e t sm t pet t in analogy with the previous approach three experiments depending on the pet data source i e pet pm pet h and modis derived pet were carried out the sm limited approach was used in former applications aimed at retrieving rainfall rates brocca et al 2015 it is a simplification of the fao56 approach useful when crop data are not available but consequently the main limitation is the missing modeling of the transpiration component for the specific crop type finally an additional approach by using modis et data directly in the algorithm was adopted in this case 8 e t et t in which et t mm day is the estimated et rate from modis the performed simulations together with their identification codes and their main features are summarized in table 2 it is noteworthy that the calibration step for the irrigation estimates through the fao56 approach was carried out by implementing the sm limited approach as over the dryland area the bare soil evaporation component is predominant dari et al 2020 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the percent bias pbias the pearson correlation coefficient r and the root mean square error rmse calculated by considering the 5 day aggregated results were used as evaluation metrics for the performed experiments for both kge and r higher values limited by a maximum equal to 1 indicate better results conversely good performances in terms of pbias and rmse are obtained when such scores assume low values 3 5 the budyko framework the budyko framework budyko 1974 was used here to analyze how the water supplied to the irrigation districts is partitioned between evapotranspiration and surface and sub surface flows the method was formulated to perform long term water balances at the catchment scale which is the canonical way of application of the approach see e g sposito 2017 stisen et al 2021 massari et al 2021a in this study the framework was used to understand which evapotranspiration formulation among those considered was consistent with the processes happening over three of the four pilot irrigated areas the urgell was not considered because of the missing data in the benchmark irrigation time series according to the budyko approach on a graph plotting the evaporative index i e the et to rainfall ratio against the aridity index i e the pet to rainfall ratio it is possible to detect two particular conditions namely the energy limit and the water limit the energy limit is reached when the evapotranspiration process happens at the potential rate while the water limit is reached when the et rate is equal to the rainfall rate hence the evapotranspiration process is limited by energy if the aridity index is lower than 1 and by water if the aridity index is higher than 1 all the abovementioned considerations are true under natural conditions stisen et al 2021 used the budyko framework to evaluate the performances of remotely sensed evapotranspiration data sets over 23 european catchments the authors found that in some cases over highly anthropized basins remotely sensed evapotranspiration data exceeded the water limit this is attributable to irrigation representing an additional input not considered in the balance but tracked by remote sensing data hence we applied the budyko framework to the pilot irrigation districts where this behaviour is expected to be exacerbated as only irrigated areas are considered a conceptualization of the idea is provided in fig 3 panel a shows the natural condition while the real one is provided in panel b under natural conditions the input rainfall is partitioned between evapotranspiration and a term summarizing surface and sub surface flows however in the real situation the additional input provided by irrigation can impact on the other two terms it is noteworthy that under both natural and real conditions incoming flows exist too and they can be impacted by irrigation in some cases however this particular case is not shown in fig 3 in order to not add complexity to the conceptual scheme in this work the budyko approach was tested with all the evapotranspiration sources used by considering both rainfall and rainfall plus irrigation as reference input water when considering rainfall only it is expected that evapotranspiration sources well accounting for irrigation show a shift with respect to the water limit conversely the water limit is supposed to be respected when the sum of rainfall plus irrigation is considered 4 results 4 1 comparison of the performed experiments this section describes and compares the performances in estimating irrigation obtained by implementing the seven different evapotranspiration modeling approaches into the sm based inversion algorithm table 3 provides the values of the parameters a b and z adopted for each irrigation estimate experiment carried out as previously clarified in all the simulations using pet data i e fao56 pm fao56 h fao56 m sm pm sm h and sm m the calibration step was performed through the sm limited approach hence the parameters values were the same for each pet source see table 3 the 5 day aggregated time series of district averaged irrigation amounts estimated according to the different approaches implemented as well as the benchmark values are provided in fig 4 the black line indicates the irrigation estimates obtained through the fao56 pm simulation namely the result obtained in dari et al 2020 the mutual relationships between the modeling approaches during the highest intensity irrigation seasons were often maintained the results of the approach exploiting modis et tended to be placed between those referring to the sm limited approach lower limit and to the fao56 approach upper limit nevertheless over the south catalan and aragonese portion the results of the et m simulation were very close to those obtained through the fao56 pm experiment all the simulations converged during the winter season thus suggesting that false irrigation alarms if detected were not attributable to the evapotranspiration term fig 5 allows a better evaluation of underestimates and overestimates associated to the performed simulations as it shows the differences between the estimated irrigation amounts and the benchmark values for all the districts a pattern of not negligible underestimation during the highest intensity irrigation season associated to the sm limited approach was recurring generally the simulations carried out by implementing the fao56 approach provided irrigation estimates closer to the benchmark even though over the algerri balaguer differences higher than 10 mm 5 day were found the simulation whose results tended to overestimate the most the benchmark was fao56 m this result was common over all the districts and revealed that remote sensing derived modis pet rates were generally higher than those calculated starting from meteorological data i e pet pm and pet h in fact modis pet resulted 46 6 and 41 5 higher than pet pm considering the cumulated potential evapotranspiration rates in 2016 and in january september 2017 respectively the comparison with pet h revealed that modis pet was 28 1 and 29 7 higher considering the cumulated rates in 2016 and january september 2017 respectively see appendix b fig 6 provides a quantitative assessment of each simulation s performance according to all the metrics the fao56 pm and fao56 h experiments provided the best results even though with satisfactory performances in terms of kge and r the overestimates occurring when using the fao56 approach with modis pet i e the fao56 m simulation resulted in a pbias value ranging between 24 52 over the urgell district and 45 56 over the south catalan and aragonese district and in rmse values going from 4 522 mm 5 day over the south catalan and aragonese district to 7 332 mm 5 day over the algerri balaguer district according to all the evaluation metrics the worst results were provided by the sm pm and sm h simulations the sm m experiment provided slightly better results with respect to the other two belonging to the sm limited approach an interesting result is provided by looking at the performances in reproducing the actual irrigation of the et m simulation in fact by using a remotely sensed data set of et values of kge r and rmse very close to those referring to the fao56 pm and fao56 h simulations were often obtained in some cases especially over the catalan and aragonese district the approach using modis et even outperformed the simulations adopting the fao56 method implemented with both penman monteith and hargreaves formulations however the pbias values highlighted a tendency of the et m experiment in systematically underestimating the actual irrigation occurring over the urgell the algerri balaguer and the north catalan and aragonese districts the rmse heatmap revealed the difficulty of all the performed simulations in quantitatively reproducing the benchmark irrigation over the algerri balaguer district long term comparisons i e by considering the whole 2016 and the period from january to september 2017 were also carried out the results are shown in fig 7 globally the fao56 pm simulation still provided the best result followed by the fao56 h experiment overestimates associated to the fao56 m simulation and underestimates referring to the sm limited approach were confirmed it is noteworthy that during 2016 the et m experiment provided good results even better than those of the fao56 pm simulation conversely it determined not negligible underestimates for all the districts except for the south catalan and aragonese during january september 2017 the weight of the contribution of evapotranspiration term in determining the model output according to the different experiments carried out is summarized in the radar plots of fig 8 which provide the percentages of the direct contribution of the evapotranspiration term to the total direct contribution means the amount of water retrieved by the model and provided by the evapotranspiration term when the soil moisture variation is higher than zero i e after rainfall or irrigation events dari et al 2020 the mutual relationships between the weights of the evapotranspiration term according to each simulation were maintained over all the districts in fact by ranking the evapotranspiration contributions within each simulation from the minimum to the maximum the following order recurs sm pm sm h fao56 pm sm m fao56 h et m fao56 m the only exception was detected over the south catalan and aragonese district where the evapotranspiration contribution associated to the fao56 pm experiment exceeded that of the sm m simulation hence the weight of the direct effect of the evapotranspiration was maximum in the fao56 m simulation over all the pilot districts percentages ranging from 70 5 for the algerri balaguer district to 75 0 for the urgell district of the total were found conversely the minimum value of the evapotranspiration contribution was found for the sm pm simulation with percentages varying between 40 4 for the north catalan and aragonese district and 45 4 for the urgell district of the total 4 2 the budyko framework the considered evapotranspiration modeling approaches were evaluated by applying the budyko framework in two conceptual experiments results are provided in fig 9 each point is representative of a simulation and it is obtained by calculating the corresponding evaporative and aridity indices the reader is referred to table 2 for the evapotranspiration modeling adopted depending on the et or pet data source all the terms involved in the analysis were first averaged in time and then in space prior to the calculation of the indices explaining the water partitioning according to each simulation results obtained by considering rainfall only and rainfall plus irrigation as water input are provided in the left and right panels respectively when considering rainfall only it was expected that the water limit was overcome the modeling approaches relying on remotely sensed et or pet data i e fao56 m sm m et m showed such behaviour the evaporative index associated to the fao56 m simulation even reached a value higher than 2 simulations exploiting pet data calculated through meteorological data i e fao56 pm fao56 h sm pm sm h highlighted the limitations of the sm limited approach with respect to the fao56 one in fact by considering the evapotranspiration process only limited by the available soil water content the crop specific transpiration component is actually neglected as a result independently on the use of the penman monteith or the hargreaves formulations the representative points stayed above the water limit if the fao56 approach was adopted and under the limit if the sm limited approach was implemented the right panel of fig 9 shows the results obtained by considering the simulated irrigation also as a water input in this case all the representative points remained under the water limit this is an expected and coherent result since the additional irrigation related amounts were considered it is noteworthy that the addition of irrigation amounts within the balances determined a shift towards the energy limited domain 5 discussion this study was aimed at investigating the impact of evapotranspiration data from several sources on the irrigation amounts estimated through the sm based inversion algorithm in order to do this the experiment using smap soil moisture proposed in dari et al 2020 here identified as the fao56 pm simulation was modified by implementing the methodology with evapotranspiration data from various sources the aim of the additional experiments was to assess if less data demanding formulations i e hargreaves instead of penman monteith or remote sensing observations provide still reliable irrigation estimates in general the use of the sm limited approach instead of the fao56 led to not negligible underestimates this issue was exacerbated when using calculated pet rates rather than modis derived ones as it can be seen by recurring patterns of unsatisfactory metric values for the sm pm and sm h simulations in fig 6 this result is attributable to the missing representation of the transpiration component occurring when adopting the sm limited approach which is more appropriate for bare soil conditions a result emerging from all the analyses carried out was that modis pet rates were higher than those calculated through both penman monteith and hargreaves formulations on the basis of safran and era5 data in fact the highest irrigation overestimates were found for the fao56 m experiment this condition was confirmed by looking at the calibrated parameters provided in table 3 for the simulations exploiting modis pet data i e fao56 m and sm m the drainage parameter a was equal to 0 hence there was no drainage this result probably does not reflect the reality but it is determined by the high modis pet rates in fact during the calibration step the algorithm is used to reproduce rainfall over a non irrigated area if evapotranspiration rates are too high the model is constrained to simulate the absence of drainage as all rainfall water is depleted by evapotranspiration the radar plots of fig 8 as well as the results of the application of the budyko framework to the experiments using modis data see fig 9 provided further confirmations in this sense nevertheless the r values for the fao56 m and sm m ranged from 0 571 to 0 809 and from 0 492 to 0 678 respectively see fig 6 hence the irrigation dynamics remained satisfactorily reproduced if modis pet was used thus suggesting a potential exploitation of this kind of data after further modeling improvements for instance a bias correction accounting for uncertainties associated with modis derived fluxes could be implemented modanesi et al 2021a it is interesting to note that the use of the hargreaves equation rather than the penman monteith one which requires the knowledge of a higher number of meteorological variables had a low impact on the retrieved irrigation amounts all the evaluation metrics provided in fig 6 highlighted comparable performances of the fao56 pm and fao56 h experiments indicating that hargreaves is a good approach to estimate pet as it is widely used both in the literature and by agronomical engineers moreover in this study the hargreaves equation was implemented without adjusting the coefficient 0 0023 to specific climatic conditions thus introducing a potential source of uncertainty in fact several studies showed improvements in the equation reliability when regionalizing such coefficient see e g xu and singh 2002 gavilán et al 2006 mendicino and senatore 2013 gomariz castillo et al 2017 nevertheless the results in terms of irrigation estimates remained satisfactory another interesting result is provided by the direct ingestion of modis et data within the sm based inversion algorithm this approach does not require any modeling of the evapotranspiration contribution and opens the perspective of forcing the algorithm with remote sensing data only on the other hand in this case the evapotranspiration term is not linked to soil moisture with the risk of obtaining irrigation estimates not responsive to the behaviour of soil moisture however the et m simulation provided better results with respect to the experiments based on the sm limited approach and alternatively lower or comparable performances with respect to fao56 pm and fao56 h considering the long term magnitudes see fig 7 et m provided better results with respect to the reference simulation i e fao56 pm over the urgell and both partitions of the catalan and aragonese district in 2016 conversely a scarcer reproduction of the occurred irrigation during january september 2017 with respect to the results provided by the fao56 pm simulation was obtained over all the districts except for the south catalan and aragonese district this issue was probably due to evapotranspiration underestimates in modis observations during 2017 suggesting again the potential use of this data after the implementation of a properly calibrated correction factor it is important to underline that the use of remotely sensed data as an input for surface energy balance models as for instance metric mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration is another possible option for further improvements towards reliable evapotranspiration rates estimates within the proposed method see e g lian and huang 2016 lian et al 2018 the two conceptual experiments carried out within the budyko framework corroborated the abovementioned considerations when pet rates derived by meteorological data sets were used the water balance carried out by considering rainfall as the only water input revealed additional contributions attributable to irrigation for the fao56 modeling approach while the representative points referring to the sm limited approach remained below the water limit see left panel of fig 9 conversely when modis derived observations were exploited the representative points stayed above the water limit independently of the implemented approach to model the evapotranspiration term this circumstance suggests that an irrigation related information is enclosed in modis data moreover the deviations from the water limit detected for the simulations exploiting remotely sensed evapotranspiration can be not negligible as an et r value higher than 2 was found for the fao56 m configuration stisen et al 2021 pointed out that shifts with respect to the water limits detected for basins located in southern europe are attributable to irrigation practices even though their effect can be mitigated at the catchment scale hence if irrigated areas only are considered as in this case it is expected that the irrigation impacts are exacerbated deviations from the water limit were absent in the results referring to the conceptual experiment involving irrigation also see right panel of fig 9 thus meaning that if human induced additional inputs are considered the real system behaves following the laws of physics 6 conclusions in this study evapotranspiration data from multiple sources were tested for irrigation quantification through the sm based inversion algorithm and results were compared with a reference experiment described in dari et al 2020 more in detail the analyses carried out in this study were aimed at assessing the loss of accuracy if any in reproducing the actual irrigation amounts by implementing simplified approaches or using remote sensing data to account for the evapotranspiration contribution within the proposed algorithm on the basis of previously discussed results three main conclusions can be drawn 1 when pet rates were calculated starting from meteorological data the sm limited approach was not suitable to derive the et rates as such approach neglects the vegetation transpiration component 2 the fao56 approach implemented with the hargreaves formula provided similar results with respect to its rigorous application which requires the use of the penman monteith equation this result was supported by all the evaluation metrics used i e 5 days aggregated kge pbias r and rmse hence the hargreaves formulation is a valid and less computational costly alternative to penman monteith in this kind of application 3 potential in implementing the method with remotely sensed data only was highlighted see e g the et m experiment in fact especially during 2016 the use of modis et in the sm based inversion algorithm provided reliable long term district averaged estimates this is a promising result making further development efforts worth results provide guidance for further improvements of the method to be implemented with very high resolution up to plot scale soil moisture data from sentinel 1 within the esa irrigation project whose main aim is to develop remote sensing based techniques to detect and estimate irrigation under this perspective the further development of a finer modeling of the evapotranspiration term using modis et e g by introducing an adjustment factor as well as the testing of other remotely sensed evapotranspiration data sets e g obtained by merging sentinel 2 and sentinel 3 observations are foreseen steps towards a reliable sm based inversion algorithm configuration forced with remotely sensed data only declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

visit https esairrigationplus org the authors wish to thank the saih ebro for providing the irrigation volumes data used to derive the benchmark values adopted in this study appendix a remote sensing based parametrization of k c in the fao56 approach see fig a 1 in this section the methodology to obtain the dynamic k c both in space and time used in the simulations adopting the fao56 approach is described the procedure proposed in dari et al 2020 mainly relies on remotely sensed data according to the dual crop approach allen et al 1998 k c can be expressed as a 1 k c k s k cb k e in which k s is a reduction factor accounting for stress conditions k cb indicates the basal crop coefficient and k e accounts for the soil evaporation in the proposed approach the stress occurring under water limited conditions is defined on the basis of the available water content k s is defined as follows a 2 k s sm t p sm t p k s 1 sm t p with p indicating a soil moisture threshold below which the crop starts experiencing stress a p value equal to 0 45 i e a surface soil moisture equal to the 45 of the saturation value was adopted several studies pointed out the linear relation linking the k cb value to the ndvi see e g er raki et al 2007 on this basis the k cb was obtained by normalizing the ndvi time series copernicus ndvi v2 2 product between their minimum and maximum values the evaporation from the soil surface was modeled as follows a 3 k e 1 f c sm t where f c indicates the fraction of vegetation cover copernicus fcover v2 product hence over the bare soil portion of each pixel the evaporation is assumed to be regulated by the soil moisture the implementation of the above mentioned parametrizations allowed to obtain a dynamic k c varying in both space and time as an example the spatial distributions of the mean k c during the highest intensity irrigation seasons of 2016 and 2017 are provided in figure a 1 of course the proposed remote sensing based parametrization has some limitations for instance the use of the enhanced vegetation index evi to derive the k cb could help in overcoming some uncertainties associated to the ndvi as the saturation condition reached even when the lai keeps on increasing simonneaux et al 2008 uncertainties linked to the p threshold were thoroughly assessed in dari et al 2020 where the authors pointed out a not negligible sensitivity of the results to this parameter during the highest intensity irrigation season under this perspective the implementation of a dynamic soil moisture threshold both in space and time represents a step forward foreseen for the proposed modeling in summary several improvements to the proposed empirical parametrization can be implemented but the current structure already proved its reliability and utility in modeling the k c over wide and multi cropped areas appendix b comparison of pet rates see figs b 1 and b 2 this section provides a triple comparison between pe t pm pe t h and modis pet figure b 1 shows a 3d scatter plot reporting the potential evapotranspiration rates from each source and spatially averaged over the irrigated areas the colour quantifies the differences between modis pet and pe t pm left side and between modis pet and pe t h right side the data are 5 day aggregated the same information but distributed in time is provided in figure b 2 modis pet was constantly higher than pe t pm and pe t h and the differences with respect to the potential evapotranspiration rates calculated through penman monteith and hargreaves were maximum in summer the districts averaged cumulated modis pet rates in 2016 and january september 2017 were 1474 63 mm and 1209 36 mm respectively the analogous values of pe t pm rates were 1006 09 mm and 854 60 mm while those referring to pe t h were 1151 48 mm and 932 60 mm 
9577,irrigation is the most impacting and uncertain human intervention on the water resource the possibility of retrieving information on irrigation practices through remote sensing technology opens unprecedented perspectives on the monitoring of anthropized basins this study is aimed at assessing the impact of different approaches to model the contribution of the evapotranspiration in retrieving the amounts of water applied for irrigation through a soil moisture based sm based inversion algorithm such a contribution is conclusive especially over semi arid regions three modeling approaches relying on both calculated and remotely sensed actual and potential evapotranspiration et and pet data sets were implemented to represent the evapotranspiration rate within the sm based inversion method which allows backward estimation of irrigation through the soil water balance inversion by combining the different evapotranspiration data sources and modeling approaches seven experiments aimed at inverting dispatch disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change downscaled smap soil moisture active passive soil moisture at 1 km to estimate irrigation over four heavily irrigated agricultural districts located in spain aragon and catalonia were compared the results highlighted that the application of the fao56 guidelines parametrization relying on the use of optical data as proposed by the authors in a previous study remains the most reliable configuration in fact the implementation of a simplified approach not considering the transpiration component of the specific crop led to irrigation underestimates finally it is interesting to note that the application of the method with remotely sensed et from modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer produced reliable district aggregated irrigation estimates thus opening the perspective of an algorithm configuration forced with remote sensing data only graphical abstract ga1 keywords irrigation amounts remote sensing soil water content actual evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration water balance inversion 1 introduction irrigation is widely recognized as the main driver of water availability dynamics over anthropized basins wada et al 2014 more than 70 of global surface and sub surface water withdrawals are attributable to irrigation foley et al 2011 in some countries the rates of water depletions linked to such practices reach percentages up to 90 of the available freshwater gleick et al 2012 ouaadi et al 2021 during the last decades irrigation allowed a strong intensification of the agricultural production which is expected to be further exacerbated until the limits of the sustainability in the near future because of the combined action of several factors e g climate change population growth and consequent food demand rising living standard and dietary changes ozdogan et al 2010 massari et al 2021b on the basis of the abovementioned considerations it is clear that irrigation represents a human activity whose impact on the natural water cycle is not negligible despite this irrigation dynamics are still highly uncertain worldwide hence any effort towards a rational management of irrigation water seems useless until the following questions keep on remaining mostly unsolved i when and where do irrigation practices actually occur and ii how much water is used for irrigation recently remote sensing technology shed a light on this topic providing observations helpful to develop techniques and methods aimed at answering both questions i and ii

observations is a more challenging task both remotely sensed evapotranspiration romaguera et al 2014 van eekelen et al 2015 peña arancibia et al 2016 and soil moisture brocca et al 2018 jalilvand et al 2019 zaussinger et al 2019 dari et al 2020 zohaib and choi 2020 zappa et al 2021 data sets have been recently exploited in irrigation estimates studies in particular brocca et al 2018 proposed for the first time an irrigation quantification method based on the inversion of the soil moisture signal such an approach is an evolution of the sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2014 originally developed to estimate rainfall from soil moisture observations i e by using the soil as a natural rain gauge the method was tested with coarse resolution soil moisture data from smap soil moisture active passive smos soil moisture and ocean salinity ascat advanced scatterometer and amsr2 advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 thus highlighting the potential of the method in retrieving irrigation amounts nevertheless limitations due to the low spatial resolution were pointed out jalilvand et al 2019 implemented the sm2rain algorithm to estimate irrigation quantities in iran through amsr2 ascat and smos soil moisture data in that study the not negligible role played by the evapotranspiration term within the algorithm especially in applications over semi arid regions was highlighted on this basis dari et al 2020 further developed the method by implementing the guidelines provided by the fao food and agriculture organization paper n 56 allen et al 1998 within the sm2rain algorithm with the aim of obtaining a better modeling of the evapotranspiration term the algorithm was applied over north east of spain with 1 km resolution dispatch disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change merlin et al 2013 downscaled smos and smap soil moisture satisfactory results in reproducing both irrigation magnitudes and their spatial distributions were obtained nevertheless in literature alternative methods to the sm2rain algorithm and exploiting remotely sensed soil moisture do exist as an example the approach relying on the discrepancies between satellite and modeled soil moisture originally proposed by zaussinger et al 2019 has been recently updated by zappa et al 2021 by including evapotranspiration and drainage losses the method was tested in northern germany with high resolution 500 m soil moisture observations from sentinel 1 an agreement between estimated irrigation spatio temporal dynamics and the benchmark quantified by a mean pearson correlation equal to 0 64 was found finally data assimilation techniques exploiting remote sensing soil moisture data are also used in irrigation quantification studies see e g lievens et al 2017 abolafia rosenzweig et al 2019 modanesi et al 2021b in this work the methodology proposed in dari et al 2020 is further developed more in detail the soil moisture based sm based inversion approach derived by the sm2rain algorithm is tested by implementing the method with evapotranspiration data from multiple sources the main objectives of the study are i to evaluate the loss of accuracy in reproducing the actual irrigation amounts when less data demanding approaches to reproduce the et rates are used and ii to investigate the reliability of a configuration forced with remote sensing data only in order to do this the estimates produced by the experiment exploiting smap soil moisture proposed in dari et al 2020 are compared with results obtained by carrying out six new simulations over the same pilot area each simulation is characterized by a different configuration adopted to model the evapotranspiration contribution not negligible in this kind of applications several potential and actual evapotranspiration henceforth pet and et data sets derived from the penman monteith allen et al 1998 and hargreaves hargreaves and samani 1982 1985 methods or from modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer observations are exploited finally an evaluation of the results based on the budyko framework budyko 1974 useful to investigate if the considered evapotranspiration formulations are consistent with the physical processes happening over the pilot area is provided 2 study area the pilot area is located in spain and falls within the basin of the main mediterranean river of the iberian peninsula i e the ebro river the analyses presented in this study are focused on a 10 000 km2 area enclosing the widest irrigated portion of the basin the main features of the study area are provided in fig 1 more in detail panel a shows the position with respect to the ebro basin and to the iberian peninsula panel b shows the organization of the irrigation infrastructure and panel c provides the digital elevation model dem of the selected tile three pilot irrigation districts have been considered the catalan and aragonese district the algerri balaguer district and the urgell district the catalan and aragonese district has been further divided into its northern and southern portions it is supplied by the canal de aragón y cataluña shown in red in panel b of fig 1 the algerri balaguer district is fed with water from the canal de algerri balaguer which is represented in magenta while the urgell district receives water from the canal de urgell in blue and the canal auxiliar de urgell in light blue the districts differ from each other in terms of adopted irrigation technique and frequency as well as density of the irrigation infrastructure bazzi et al 2019 dari et al 2020 the most widespread crop types are summer cereals forage and fruit trees dari et al 2021 panel b of fig 1 also provides the extension of the irrigated areas whose partitioning is specified in panel c the secondary irrigation canals represented in cyan the measurement stations belonging to the saih sistema automático de información hidrológica ebro network used to derive the benchmark irrigation amounts and a wide semi arid area represented in orange which has been used as calibration domain for the proposed algorithm since it is not irrigated see section 3 4 for further details the dem shown in panel c has a spatial resolution of 25 m it is provided by the copernicus land monitoring service eu dem v1 1 product in the near future an expansion of the irrigated areas towards east is foreseen the project includes the realization of a new canal the canal segarra garrigues allowing the conversion of a dryland area to a new irrigation district however the strong contrast currently existing between the irrigated portions and the surrounding semi arid environment makes the considered area an ideal case study for both irrigation detection gao et al 2018 bazzi et al 2019 dari et al 2021 and quantification dari et al 2020 purposes information about soil properties is provided in both fig 2 and table 1 more in detail fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of the soil textural features bulk density and percentages of clay sand and silt contents the maps have a spatial resolution of 250 m they are derived from the isric international soil reference and information centre soil grids data set v2 0 updated from its previous version hengl et al 2017 table 1 summarizes the spatially averaged sand silt and clay contents as well as bulk density over the four irrigation districts and the dryland area used as a calibration domain the study site is mainly silty and in general analogous soil properties can be observed over irrigation districts and the rainfed area used as a calibration domain 3 materials and methods 3 1 remote sensing data sets remotely sensed data sets of soil moisture evapotranspiration and vegetation parameters were used in this work soil moisture observations retrieved by the smap satellite and disaggregated through the dispatch algorithm at the spatial resolution of 1 km were exploited in the performed experiments smap is a nasa national aeronautics and spatial administration mission launched at the beginning of 2015 originally the smap equipment was designed to retrieve surface soil moisture measurements at three different spatial resolutions 36 km 9 km and 3 km through the synergy between an l band radar 1 26 ghz and an l band radiometer 1 4 ghz nevertheless the premature failure of the radar determined the impossibility of delivering the 3 km product until the replacement of smap radar derived data with sentinel 1a sentinel 1b sar derived observations das et al 2019 the data set used in this study is a 1 km product obtained by disaggregating the 36 km version through the dispatch downscaling algorithm the method allows to redistribute the high resolution soil moisture within the pixel of the coarser resolution data in a conservative way i e by maintaining the average value unaltered the disaggregation relies on the link existing between the surface soil moisture and the soil evaporative efficiency see namely the ratio of et to pet in order to compute the see land surface temperature lst and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data at 1 km spatial resolution retrieved by the modis sensor are used remote sensing based evapotranspiration data sets derived from modis observations were exploited they consist in the et and pet data from the mod16a2 product cleugh et al 2006 mu et al 2007 sampled at a spatial resolution of 500 m and aggregated at 8 day temporal frequency daily et and pet rates were computed through the modis16 et processing algorithm based on the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 meteorological data and modis observations are used as an input non satellite input variables are taken from the merra gmao modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications global modeling and assimilation office data set at about 50 km spatial resolution rienecker et al 2011 while the 1 km modis retrieved variables used are land cover type 2 friedl et al 2002 fpar lai fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation leaf area index data myneni et al 2002 and albedo salomon et al 2006 both et and pet rates are obtained as the sum of the evaporation from the soil surface and the evapotranspiration from the canopy surface with the latter further divided into the evaporation component from the wet canopy surface and the transpiration component from the dry canopy surface mu et al 2013 vegetation indices derived from optical remote sensing were also used they are the fraction of vegetation cover fcover v2 and the ndvi v2 2 data sets both products obtained after processing observations of the spot vegetation satellite pour l observation de la terre vegetation sensor and of its successor proba v project for on board autonomy vegetation dierckx et al 2014 sterckx et al 2014 have a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal one of 10 days with a 10 daily compositing temporal basis the fcover data vary between 0 bare soil pixel and 1 fully vegetated pixel while ndvi data have a physical range of 0 08 0 92 both products are provided by the copernicus global land service cgls 3 2 meteorological data sets the meteorological variables used in this study mainly come from the safran système d analyse fournissant des renseignements atmosphériques à la neige analysis system durand et al 1993 quintana seguí et al 2008 2017 applied over the iberian peninsula whose output is a gridded product at 5 km spatial resolution and at an hourly time interval the data set is built by interpolating a first guess produced by a numerical weather prediction model with ground measurements in this case ground observed data were taken from the aemet agencia estatal de meteorología network while era interim european reanalysis interim data delivered by the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf were used as a first guess with the only exception of rainfall rate for which aemet data were used in this study meteorological data were both directly used as an input in the sm based inversion algorithm in the case of rainfall rate and exploited to compute pet according to two different formulations safran air relative humidity rainfall rate air temperature wind speed as well as solar radiation from the era 5 reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 were used for this purpose pet rates were calculated according to the penman monteith allen et al 1998 and the hargreaves hargreaves and samani 1982 1985 equations in accordance to the fao food and agricultural organization method allen et al 1998 the original penman monteith formulation penman 1948 monteith 1965 is parametrized as follows 1 pet pm 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 in which δ kpa c indicates the slope of the vapor pressure curve r n mj m2day is the net radiation at the crop surface g mj m2day represents the density of the soil heat flux γ kpa c is the psychrometric constant t c is the daily averaged air temperature at 2 m height u 2 m s indicates the wind speed at 2 m height e s kpa is the saturation vapor pressure and e a kpa is the actual vapor pressure eq 1 relies on the following assumptions a reference grass crop of 12 cm height a fixed albedo equal to 0 23 and a value of the surface resistance equal to 70 s m the hargreaves hargreaves and samani 1982 1985 formula represents an alternative to the penman monteith equation in case of missing weather data i e air relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation it is expressed by 2 pet h 0 0023 t 17 8 t max t min 0 5 r a where t c has the same meaning as above t max c and t min c represent the daily maximum and the daily minimum air temperature at 2 m height respectively and r a mj m2day is the extraterrestrial radiation it is noteworthy that pet data calculated through both approaches described and the meteorological variables used were resampled to the 1 km regular grid adopted in this study and aggregated at a daily time step 3 3 irrigation volumes the benchmark irrigation volumes were deduced by the canals flow data recorded at selected stations of the saih system saih ebro 2021 see fig 1 in particular the stations c081 el ciego and c101 coll de foix along the canal de aragón y cataluña were considered for the northern and southern partitions of the catalan and aragonese district respectively data recorded at the stations c116 cabecera urgell along the canal de urgell and c117 auxiliar urgell along the canal auxiliar de urgell were exploited for the urgell area it is noteworthy that the irrigation data for the urgell district is missing for an 8 months period from july 2016 to february 2017 for this reason an alternative benchmark value for the year 2016 deduced by the hydrological plan of the spanish part of the ebro river basin referring to the period 2015 2021 was considered for the long term comparison all the above mentioned observation sections are located just downstream different reservoirs used to stock water to be delivered to the crops the algerri balaguer district is fed with water pumped directly from the river at the station e271 of the network hence the volumes of water pumped have been considered in this case in order to be compared with satellite derived estimates the benchmark irrigation volumes were converted to equivalent irrigation thicknesses in mm and reduced by considering the losses attributable to the irrigation infrastructure the irrigation doses in mm were obtained by dividing the volumes by the area of each district the losses were assumed equal to the 30 of the gross value for the urgell to the 15 for both partitions of the catalan and aragonese district and to 10 for the algerri balaguer such coefficients were determined on the basis of the prevalent irrigation technique in each district of the age of the infrastructure and of regional studies cots et al 1993 maté et al 1994 causapé et al 2006 for further details about the irrigation infrastructure in the study area the reader is referred to dari et al 2020 3 4 the sm based inversion approach the proposed approach is an evolution of the sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2014 born with the aim of retrieving rainfall from soil moisture observations and later adapted to estimate irrigation brocca et al 2018 recently further improvements have been implemented on the basis of studies highlighting the essential role played by the evapotranspiration contribution in estimating irrigation especially over semi arid areas jalilvand et al 2019 dari et al 2020 the core idea of the method consists in backwards estimating the amount of water entering the soil w in t by inverting the water balance expressed by 3 w in t z dsm t dt g t sr t e t in which z mm indicates the water capacity of the soil layer calculated as the product between the soil layer depth and its porosity dsm t dt represent the variation of relative soil moisture sm t in time t days g t mm day is the drainage rate sr t mm day represents the surface runoff rate and e t mm day is the et rate the g t term is linked to sm t through a power law equation famiglietti and woods 1994 brocca et al 2014 g t asm t b with a mm and b indicating drainage parameters while the sr t contribution is assumed to be negligible previous studies showed that potential residual errors attributable to such an assumption are small brocca et al 2015 jalilvand et al 2019 in this work the same irrigation estimate scheme was repeated several times by implementing different approaches to model the e t term the experiment setting was common to all the simulations in fact the model parameters a b and z were calibrated over the non irrigated area adjacent to the urgell district orange area in panel b of fig 1 over such portion the only external input is the rainfall rate r t mm day hence w in t r t conversely the irrigation estimates were carried out over the irrigated areas where the water entering into the soil is determined by the sum of r t and the irrigation rate irr t mm day summarizing the model parameters were calibrated by estimating the rainfall amounts over the dryland area according to the following equation 4 r t z dsm t dt a sm t b e t and minimizing the root mean square difference between such amounts and the safran rainfall rates then the spatial median values of the distributions of a b and z were used as fixed values for the irrigation estimate step which was carried out over the irrigated districts both calibration and estimate phases were performed by adopting a 5 day temporal aggregation the irrigation amounts were retrieved by applying eq 3 and removing the rainfall signal from the model output according to the following 5 irr t w in t r t it is noteworthy that negative irr t values which are mainly attributable to rainfall simulation errors jalilvand et al 2019 were set equal to zero in the following section the different approaches implemented to reproduce the e t term are described 3 4 1 performed simulations in this work seven different methods to model the e t term in the proposed sm based inversion algorithm were considered thus determining an equal number of irrigation estimates experiments the performed simulations can be grouped in three main categories on the basis of the approach adopted to obtain the et rate the first implemented approach is the fao56 one according to this method the e t term can be calculated as 6 e t k c t pet t with k c t representing the crop coefficient and pet t indicating the pet rate in this study a modeled k c dynamic both in space and time developed through parametrizations based on remotely sensed data was used i e soil moisture ndvi and fcover for further details the reader is referred to appendix a the above mentioned approach was implemented by exploiting pet data from three different sources calculated according to eq 1 to eq 2 and modis derived in the second approach the e t term was modeled as the potential rate limited by the available water content i e by multiplying pet with soil moisture henceforth sm limited approach 7 e t sm t pet t in analogy with the previous approach three experiments depending on the pet data source i e pet pm pet h and modis derived pet were carried out the sm limited approach was used in former applications aimed at retrieving rainfall rates brocca et al 2015 it is a simplification of the fao56 approach useful when crop data are not available but consequently the main limitation is the missing modeling of the transpiration component for the specific crop type finally an additional approach by using modis et data directly in the algorithm was adopted in this case 8 e t et t in which et t mm day is the estimated et rate from modis the performed simulations together with their identification codes and their main features are summarized in table 2 it is noteworthy that the calibration step for the irrigation estimates through the fao56 approach was carried out by implementing the sm limited approach as over the dryland area the bare soil evaporation component is predominant dari et al 2020 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the percent bias pbias the pearson correlation coefficient r and the root mean square error rmse calculated by considering the 5 day aggregated results were used as evaluation metrics for the performed experiments for both kge and r higher values limited by a maximum equal to 1 indicate better results conversely good performances in terms of pbias and rmse are obtained when such scores assume low values 3 5 the budyko framework the budyko framework budyko 1974 was used here to analyze how the water supplied to the irrigation districts is partitioned between evapotranspiration and surface and sub surface flows the method was formulated to perform long term water balances at the catchment scale which is the canonical way of application of the approach see e g sposito 2017 stisen et al 2021 massari et al 2021a in this study the framework was used to understand which evapotranspiration formulation among those considered was consistent with the processes happening over three of the four pilot irrigated areas the urgell was not considered because of the missing data in the benchmark irrigation time series according to the budyko approach on a graph plotting the evaporative index i e the et to rainfall ratio against the aridity index i e the pet to rainfall ratio it is possible to detect two particular conditions namely the energy limit and the water limit the energy limit is reached when the evapotranspiration process happens at the potential rate while the water limit is reached when the et rate is equal to the rainfall rate hence the evapotranspiration process is limited by energy if the aridity index is lower than 1 and by water if the aridity index is higher than 1 all the abovementioned considerations are true under natural conditions stisen et al 2021 used the budyko framework to evaluate the performances of remotely sensed evapotranspiration data sets over 23 european catchments the authors found that in some cases over highly anthropized basins remotely sensed evapotranspiration data exceeded the water limit this is attributable to irrigation representing an additional input not considered in the balance but tracked by remote sensing data hence we applied the budyko framework to the pilot irrigation districts where this behaviour is expected to be exacerbated as only irrigated areas are considered a conceptualization of the idea is provided in fig 3 panel a shows the natural condition while the real one is provided in panel b under natural conditions the input rainfall is partitioned between evapotranspiration and a term summarizing surface and sub surface flows however in the real situation the additional input provided by irrigation can impact on the other two terms it is noteworthy that under both natural and real conditions incoming flows exist too and they can be impacted by irrigation in some cases however this particular case is not shown in fig 3 in order to not add complexity to the conceptual scheme in this work the budyko approach was tested with all the evapotranspiration sources used by considering both rainfall and rainfall plus irrigation as reference input water when considering rainfall only it is expected that evapotranspiration sources well accounting for irrigation show a shift with respect to the water limit conversely the water limit is supposed to be respected when the sum of rainfall plus irrigation is considered 4 results 4 1 comparison of the performed experiments this section describes and compares the performances in estimating irrigation obtained by implementing the seven different evapotranspiration modeling approaches into the sm based inversion algorithm table 3 provides the values of the parameters a b and z adopted for each irrigation estimate experiment carried out as previously clarified in all the simulations using pet data i e fao56 pm fao56 h fao56 m sm pm sm h and sm m the calibration step was performed through the sm limited approach hence the parameters values were the same for each pet source see table 3 the 5 day aggregated time series of district averaged irrigation amounts estimated according to the different approaches implemented as well as the benchmark values are provided in fig 4 the black line indicates the irrigation estimates obtained through the fao56 pm simulation namely the result obtained in dari et al 2020 the mutual relationships between the modeling approaches during the highest intensity irrigation seasons were often maintained the results of the approach exploiting modis et tended to be placed between those referring to the sm limited approach lower limit and to the fao56 approach upper limit nevertheless over the south catalan and aragonese portion the results of the et m simulation were very close to those obtained through the fao56 pm experiment all the simulations converged during the winter season thus suggesting that false irrigation alarms if detected were not attributable to the evapotranspiration term fig 5 allows a better evaluation of underestimates and overestimates associated to the performed simulations as it shows the differences between the estimated irrigation amounts and the benchmark values for all the districts a pattern of not negligible underestimation during the highest intensity irrigation season associated to the sm limited approach was recurring generally the simulations carried out by implementing the fao56 approach provided irrigation estimates closer to the benchmark even though over the algerri balaguer differences higher than 10 mm 5 day were found the simulation whose results tended to overestimate the most the benchmark was fao56 m this result was common over all the districts and revealed that remote sensing derived modis pet rates were generally higher than those calculated starting from meteorological data i e pet pm and pet h in fact modis pet resulted 46 6 and 41 5 higher than pet pm considering the cumulated potential evapotranspiration rates in 2016 and in january september 2017 respectively the comparison with pet h revealed that modis pet was 28 1 and 29 7 higher considering the cumulated rates in 2016 and january september 2017 respectively see appendix b fig 6 provides a quantitative assessment of each simulation s performance according to all the metrics the fao56 pm and fao56 h experiments provided the best results even though with satisfactory performances in terms of kge and r the overestimates occurring when using the fao56 approach with modis pet i e the fao56 m simulation resulted in a pbias value ranging between 24 52 over the urgell district and 45 56 over the south catalan and aragonese district and in rmse values going from 4 522 mm 5 day over the south catalan and aragonese district to 7 332 mm 5 day over the algerri balaguer district according to all the evaluation metrics the worst results were provided by the sm pm and sm h simulations the sm m experiment provided slightly better results with respect to the other two belonging to the sm limited approach an interesting result is provided by looking at the performances in reproducing the actual irrigation of the et m simulation in fact by using a remotely sensed data set of et values of kge r and rmse very close to those referring to the fao56 pm and fao56 h simulations were often obtained in some cases especially over the catalan and aragonese district the approach using modis et even outperformed the simulations adopting the fao56 method implemented with both penman monteith and hargreaves formulations however the pbias values highlighted a tendency of the et m experiment in systematically underestimating the actual irrigation occurring over the urgell the algerri balaguer and the north catalan and aragonese districts the rmse heatmap revealed the difficulty of all the performed simulations in quantitatively reproducing the benchmark irrigation over the algerri balaguer district long term comparisons i e by considering the whole 2016 and the period from january to september 2017 were also carried out the results are shown in fig 7 globally the fao56 pm simulation still provided the best result followed by the fao56 h experiment overestimates associated to the fao56 m simulation and underestimates referring to the sm limited approach were confirmed it is noteworthy that during 2016 the et m experiment provided good results even better than those of the fao56 pm simulation conversely it determined not negligible underestimates for all the districts except for the south catalan and aragonese during january september 2017 the weight of the contribution of evapotranspiration term in determining the model output according to the different experiments carried out is summarized in the radar plots of fig 8 which provide the percentages of the direct contribution of the evapotranspiration term to the total direct contribution means the amount of water retrieved by the model and provided by the evapotranspiration term when the soil moisture variation is higher than zero i e after rainfall or irrigation events dari et al 2020 the mutual relationships between the weights of the evapotranspiration term according to each simulation were maintained over all the districts in fact by ranking the evapotranspiration contributions within each simulation from the minimum to the maximum the following order recurs sm pm sm h fao56 pm sm m fao56 h et m fao56 m the only exception was detected over the south catalan and aragonese district where the evapotranspiration contribution associated to the fao56 pm experiment exceeded that of the sm m simulation hence the weight of the direct effect of the evapotranspiration was maximum in the fao56 m simulation over all the pilot districts percentages ranging from 70 5 for the algerri balaguer district to 75 0 for the urgell district of the total were found conversely the minimum value of the evapotranspiration contribution was found for the sm pm simulation with percentages varying between 40 4 for the north catalan and aragonese district and 45 4 for the urgell district of the total 4 2 the budyko framework the considered evapotranspiration modeling approaches were evaluated by applying the budyko framework in two conceptual experiments results are provided in fig 9 each point is representative of a simulation and it is obtained by calculating the corresponding evaporative and aridity indices the reader is referred to table 2 for the evapotranspiration modeling adopted depending on the et or pet data source all the terms involved in the analysis were first averaged in time and then in space prior to the calculation of the indices explaining the water partitioning according to each simulation results obtained by considering rainfall only and rainfall plus irrigation as water input are provided in the left and right panels respectively when considering rainfall only it was expected that the water limit was overcome the modeling approaches relying on remotely sensed et or pet data i e fao56 m sm m et m showed such behaviour the evaporative index associated to the fao56 m simulation even reached a value higher than 2 simulations exploiting pet data calculated through meteorological data i e fao56 pm fao56 h sm pm sm h highlighted the limitations of the sm limited approach with respect to the fao56 one in fact by considering the evapotranspiration process only limited by the available soil water content the crop specific transpiration component is actually neglected as a result independently on the use of the penman monteith or the hargreaves formulations the representative points stayed above the water limit if the fao56 approach was adopted and under the limit if the sm limited approach was implemented the right panel of fig 9 shows the results obtained by considering the simulated irrigation also as a water input in this case all the representative points remained under the water limit this is an expected and coherent result since the additional irrigation related amounts were considered it is noteworthy that the addition of irrigation amounts within the balances determined a shift towards the energy limited domain 5 discussion this study was aimed at investigating the impact of evapotranspiration data from several sources on the irrigation amounts estimated through the sm based inversion algorithm in order to do this the experiment using smap soil moisture proposed in dari et al 2020 here identified as the fao56 pm simulation was modified by implementing the methodology with evapotranspiration data from various sources the aim of the additional experiments was to assess if less data demanding formulations i e hargreaves instead of penman monteith or remote sensing observations provide still reliable irrigation estimates in general the use of the sm limited approach instead of the fao56 led to not negligible underestimates this issue was exacerbated when using calculated pet rates rather than modis derived ones as it can be seen by recurring patterns of unsatisfactory metric values for the sm pm and sm h simulations in fig 6 this result is attributable to the missing representation of the transpiration component occurring when adopting the sm limited approach which is more appropriate for bare soil conditions a result emerging from all the analyses carried out was that modis pet rates were higher than those calculated through both penman monteith and hargreaves formulations on the basis of safran and era5 data in fact the highest irrigation overestimates were found for the fao56 m experiment this condition was confirmed by looking at the calibrated parameters provided in table 3 for the simulations exploiting modis pet data i e fao56 m and sm m the drainage parameter a was equal to 0 hence there was no drainage this result probably does not reflect the reality but it is determined by the high modis pet rates in fact during the calibration step the algorithm is used to reproduce rainfall over a non irrigated area if evapotranspiration rates are too high the model is constrained to simulate the absence of drainage as all rainfall water is depleted by evapotranspiration the radar plots of fig 8 as well as the results of the application of the budyko framework to the experiments using modis data see fig 9 provided further confirmations in this sense nevertheless the r values for the fao56 m and sm m ranged from 0 571 to 0 809 and from 0 492 to 0 678 respectively see fig 6 hence the irrigation dynamics remained satisfactorily reproduced if modis pet was used thus suggesting a potential exploitation of this kind of data after further modeling improvements for instance a bias correction accounting for uncertainties associated with modis derived fluxes could be implemented modanesi et al 2021a it is interesting to note that the use of the hargreaves equation rather than the penman monteith one which requires the knowledge of a higher number of meteorological variables had a low impact on the retrieved irrigation amounts all the evaluation metrics provided in fig 6 highlighted comparable performances of the fao56 pm and fao56 h experiments indicating that hargreaves is a good approach to estimate pet as it is widely used both in the literature and by agronomical engineers moreover in this study the hargreaves equation was implemented without adjusting the coefficient 0 0023 to specific climatic conditions thus introducing a potential source of uncertainty in fact several studies showed improvements in the equation reliability when regionalizing such coefficient see e g xu and singh 2002 gavilán et al 2006 mendicino and senatore 2013 gomariz castillo et al 2017 nevertheless the results in terms of irrigation estimates remained satisfactory another interesting result is provided by the direct ingestion of modis et data within the sm based inversion algorithm this approach does not require any modeling of the evapotranspiration contribution and opens the perspective of forcing the algorithm with remote sensing data only on the other hand in this case the evapotranspiration term is not linked to soil moisture with the risk of obtaining irrigation estimates not responsive to the behaviour of soil moisture however the et m simulation provided better results with respect to the experiments based on the sm limited approach and alternatively lower or comparable performances with respect to fao56 pm and fao56 h considering the long term magnitudes see fig 7 et m provided better results with respect to the reference simulation i e fao56 pm over the urgell and both partitions of the catalan and aragonese district in 2016 conversely a scarcer reproduction of the occurred irrigation during january september 2017 with respect to the results provided by the fao56 pm simulation was obtained over all the districts except for the south catalan and aragonese district this issue was probably due to evapotranspiration underestimates in modis observations during 2017 suggesting again the potential use of this data after the implementation of a properly calibrated correction factor it is important to underline that the use of remotely sensed data as an input for surface energy balance models as for instance metric mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration is another possible option for further improvements towards reliable evapotranspiration rates estimates within the proposed method see e g lian and huang 2016 lian et al 2018 the two conceptual experiments carried out within the budyko framework corroborated the abovementioned considerations when pet rates derived by meteorological data sets were used the water balance carried out by considering rainfall as the only water input revealed additional contributions attributable to irrigation for the fao56 modeling approach while the representative points referring to the sm limited approach remained below the water limit see left panel of fig 9 conversely when modis derived observations were exploited the representative points stayed above the water limit independently of the implemented approach to model the evapotranspiration term this circumstance suggests that an irrigation related information is enclosed in modis data moreover the deviations from the water limit detected for the simulations exploiting remotely sensed evapotranspiration can be not negligible as an et r value higher than 2 was found for the fao56 m configuration stisen et al 2021 pointed out that shifts with respect to the water limits detected for basins located in southern europe are attributable to irrigation practices even though their effect can be mitigated at the catchment scale hence if irrigated areas only are considered as in this case it is expected that the irrigation impacts are exacerbated deviations from the water limit were absent in the results referring to the conceptual experiment involving irrigation also see right panel of fig 9 thus meaning that if human induced additional inputs are considered the real system behaves following the laws of physics 6 conclusions in this study evapotranspiration data from multiple sources were tested for irrigation quantification through the sm based inversion algorithm and results were compared with a reference experiment described in dari et al 2020 more in detail the analyses carried out in this study were aimed at assessing the loss of accuracy if any in reproducing the actual irrigation amounts by implementing simplified approaches or using remote sensing data to account for the evapotranspiration contribution within the proposed algorithm on the basis of previously discussed results three main conclusions can be drawn 1 when pet rates were calculated starting from meteorological data the sm limited approach was not suitable to derive the et rates as such approach neglects the vegetation transpiration component 2 the fao56 approach implemented with the hargreaves formula provided similar results with respect to its rigorous application which requires the use of the penman monteith equation this result was supported by all the evaluation metrics used i e 5 days aggregated kge pbias r and rmse hence the hargreaves formulation is a valid and less computational costly alternative to penman monteith in this kind of application 3 potential in implementing the method with remotely sensed data only was highlighted see e g the et m experiment in fact especially during 2016 the use of modis et in the sm based inversion algorithm provided reliable long term district averaged estimates this is a promising result making further development efforts worth results provide guidance for further improvements of the method to be implemented with very high resolution up to plot scale soil moisture data from sentinel 1 within the esa irrigation project whose main aim is to develop remote sensing based techniques to detect and estimate irrigation under this perspective the further development of a finer modeling of the evapotranspiration term using modis et e g by introducing an adjustment factor as well as the testing of other remotely sensed evapotranspiration data sets e g obtained by merging sentinel 2 and sentinel 3 observations are foreseen steps towards a reliable sm based inversion algorithm configuration forced with

based parametrization of k c in the fao56 approach see fig a 1 in this section the methodology to obtain the dynamic k c both in space and time used in the simulations adopting the fao56 approach is described the procedure proposed in dari et al 2020 mainly relies on remotely sensed data according to the dual crop approach allen et al 1998 k c can be expressed as a 1 k c k s k cb k e in which k s is a reduction factor accounting for stress conditions k cb indicates the basal crop coefficient and k e accounts for the soil evaporation in the proposed approach the stress occurring under water limited conditions is defined on the basis of the available water content k s is defined as follows a 2 k s sm t p sm t p k s 1 sm t p with p indicating a soil moisture threshold below which the crop starts experiencing stress a p value equal to 0 45 i e a surface soil moisture equal to the 45 of the saturation value was adopted several studies pointed out the linear relation linking the k cb value to the ndvi see e g er raki et al 2007 on this basis the k cb was obtained by normalizing the ndvi time series copernicus ndvi v2 2 product between their minimum and maximum values the evaporation from the soil surface was modeled as follows a 3 k e 1 f c sm t where f c indicates the fraction of vegetation cover copernicus fcover v2 product hence over the bare soil portion of each pixel the evaporation is assumed to be regulated by the soil moisture the implementation of the above mentioned parametrizations allowed to obtain a dynamic k c varying in both space and time as an example the spatial distributions of the mean k c during the highest intensity irrigation seasons of 2016 and 2017 are provided in figure a 1 of course the proposed remote sensing based parametrization has some limitations for instance the use of the enhanced vegetation index evi to derive the k cb could help in overcoming some uncertainties associated to the ndvi as the saturation condition reached even when the lai keeps on increasing simonneaux et al 2008 uncertainties linked to the p threshold were thoroughly assessed in dari et al 2020 where the authors pointed out a not negligible sensitivity of the results to this parameter during the highest intensity irrigation season under this perspective the implementation of a dynamic soil moisture threshold both in space and time represents a step forward foreseen for the proposed modeling in summary several improvements to the proposed empirical parametrization can be implemented but the current structure already proved its reliability and utility in modeling the k c over wide and multi cropped areas appendix b comparison of pet rates see figs b 1 and b 2 this section provides a triple comparison between pe t pm pe t h and modis pet figure b 1 shows a 3d scatter plot reporting the potential evapotranspiration rates from each source and spatially averaged over the irrigated areas the colour quantifies the differences between modis pet and pe t pm left side and between modis pet and pe t h right side the data are 5 day aggregated the same information but distributed in time is provided in figure b 2 modis pet was constantly higher than pe t pm and pe t h and the differences with respect to the potential evapotranspiration rates calculated through penman monteith and hargreaves were maximum in summer the districts averaged cumulated modis pet rates in 2016 and january september 2017 were 1474 63 mm and 1209 36 mm respectively the analogous values of pe t pm rates were 1006 09 mm and 854 60 mm while those referring to pe t h were 1151 48 mm and 932 60 mm 
9578,long term changes in reservoir inflow due to climate changes and human interference violate the assumptions of hydrologic stationarity especially in the reservoir design utilization of uncertain prediction into a reservoir operating rule curves somehow reflects the challenges that imposed by nonstationary conditions this study proposes a hedging based policy incorporated forecast term to manage release decisions in two separate phases hedging is applied firstly regarding to reservoir water level similar to conventional hedging rules and secondary according to an extra simulation in the near future to determine the time interval of future effects an exterior optimization model is introduced to handle the trade off between forecast uncertainty and future information which imposed by forecast horizon future inflows are forecasted introducing a model including a wrapper based feature selection method and adaboost rt as a learning algorithm the results of applying the model to a real six reservoir system in iran showed that incorporating future inflows into the real time decisions significantly improves the total squared relative deficit about 20 and 10 compared to conventional hedging rule curve chrc and standard operation policy as objective function also having a glance at the near future reduces the vulnerability of the system about 5 and 27 respectively against chrc and sop the results also showed that although the sop reaches to a best reliability of satisfying water demands in total system as 31 and 27 better than chrc and the proposed two phase policy but the number of intensified failures was higher than two others which somehow influences on volume based indices like vulnerability keywords hedging policy forecast uncertainty nonstationarity climate change adaboost algorithm teleconnection indices data availability all data models and code are available from the corresponding author by request 1 introduction streamflow stationarity is one of the main assumptions during water resources operating rule extraction which its accuracy is impressed by some factors such as climate change milly et al 2008 from a statistical point of view the long term average of streamflow has a constant probability of occurrence in a stationary condition therefore historical streamflow time series can be used confidently as future flow patterns however this conditions rarely occur as urban development plans climate change deforestation etc can alter the rainfall runoff components which lead to hydrological variations loucks and van beek 2005 many prevalent models satisfy the stationary assumption by using historical time series as well as data generation nonstationarity violates the initial assumption and greatly imposes challenges to the policies resulted from these models in general reservoir operation could be affected severely by the nonstationary the great karun water resources system located in iran suffers from such problems ashrafi and mahmoudi 2022 to overcome this challenge operation policy must somehow take into account inflow nonstationarity aiming to reach higher accuracy therefore many researches are being investigated to somehow solve this problem xu et al 2015 proposed rules for multi stage optimum hedging policy incorporating uncertain predictions for large reservoirs with multi layer flow regulation capacities three predefined rules are derived for determination of optimum solution in miyun reservoir in china the results showed that the reservoir performance under hedging policy benefiting from arima predictions was better than actual operation and sop zhao et al 2014 developed optimum hedging rules for reservoir flood control under hydrological nonstationarity using hydro economic and mathematical analysis they clustered flood volume into three groups based on intensity and allocated some part of reservoir for each one the results showed that hedging policy had better performance to balance marginal value of flood management resources under nonstationarity compared with other policy yang and ng 2017 studied the accuracy of operating rules against the inflow time series and evaluated the sustainability of a policy against nonstationary flows feng et al 2017 investigated the alteration of operating indices under different scenarios of inflow they reflected effects of nonstationarity into variable scenarios such as the shift in the mean the coefficient of variation c v and seasonality results showed that increasing of mean of inflow changes the operating rules and it increases the water release and vice versa while the shift of c v has little impact on operating rules also the seasonality changes operating rules are in opposite directions during refill and drawdown periods liu et al 2019 applied a bayesian deep learning method to study the influence of inflow uncertainty on reservoir operation rules which considers both model parameter uncertainty and inflow uncertainty the uncertainty estimation results showed that the influence of inflow uncertainty on reservoir operation is greater than model parameter uncertainty the results also emphasized in order to keep operating policy balanced some statistical alteration must be made corresponding to inflow components gavahi et al 2019 presented a forecast based adaptive real time operation model atrom for bukan reservoir which consists of an adaptive neuro fuzzy system and an inflow forecast model to determine optimize release rate the results demonstrate that proposed model attains an objective function very close to the best possible value than can be reached by a perfect foresight about the future streamflow jin and lee 2019 aimed to present a discrete hedging rule running through several phases to introduce an effective method for water supply operation the results showed that the derived rules based on beginning storage were placed higher than others which induced earlier rationing of water supply allawi et al 2019 attempted to develop an integrated forecasting based operational model in which the reservoir inflow and evaporation were forecasted and a simulation optimization model generated optimized rule curves findings revealed the necessity of forecast term to achieve more accurate rules peng et al 2019 presented a platform consisting of a rainfall runoff model and a stochastic dynamic programming method for reservoir operation the results demonstrated that hydropower generation can be increased compared to traditional rule curves which indicated that the use of forecast considerably facilitates the performance of operating rules wan et al 2019 established the linkage of rule curves and hedging theory by analyzing three fundamental problems surrounding the design of conventional rule curves namely the law and design of water supply rule curves the determination of flood control storage and the division of refill and drawdown circle the results showed that based on the historical records the rule curves can be interpreted as a specific expression of hedging theory ashrafi et al 2020 compared two polynomial and hedging rules with and without forecast term to identify the effects of inflow forecast in a real time decision making the results highlighted the role of inflows on operation policies they also concluded that the longer forecast horizons could have better effects on real time decision making xu et al 2020 developed a two phase stochastic optimization model to determine the optimal conservation level for flood water by minimizing the risks from both floods and water shortages the results showed that the hedging rules outperformed the capacity constrained pre release rules for conserving flood water without increasing the flood risk all these researches reflect the influence of nonstationarity into some scenarios and acknowledged that the rules must be adjusted against these variation patterns from the other hand adaptive management has been used as an alternative to handle nonstationarity in various resource management topics such as brekke 2009 these studies somehow apply adaptive management in which sequential decision are made based on updated forecast adaptive management reflects forecast uncertainty into an adaptive system and combined common weakness of hydrology and water resource management one of the big challenges of adaptive management is how to approach forecast uncertainty into optimization models vicuna et al 2010 combined climate change scenarios into sample stochastic dynamic programming for three case studies since then hedging policy has been widely discussed in reservoir operation fields draper and lund 2004 used hedging policy to make balance between storage and release benefits you and cai 2008 introduced a two stage model that incorporate future inflow imposed by uncertainty zhao et al 2011 explicitly assign hydrological forecast into a two stage stochastic model followed by forecast uncertainties the effects of three typical constraints i e mass balance nonnegative release and storage constraints were analyzed under both certain and uncertain conditions results showed higher uncertainty level in the future led to stricter hedging to make the model compatible with unknown future conditions although the two stage hedging policy is theoretically crucial a multistage optimization model incorporating forecast uncertainty is required for adaptive operation due to the interaction between current decision and future stages on the other recent studies just incorporated the future conditions in terms of some scenario based solutions which turns variable inflow patterns into some scenarios entering to reservoirs so in order to propose a novel structure for multi stage model which considers future inflow patterns this paper introduces a new multistage reservoir operation model which includes two separate hedging phases using predicted streamflow the first hedging phase is similar to conventional hedging stage based on reservoir water level while in the second phase a future based hedging policy is assigned according to forecast model in each stage more importantly coupled forecast model is updated after each time step using a rolling time framework and inserts forecast term as an input to the reservoir model to develop forecast model a data driven method based on machine learning concepts using feature selection and ensemble learning algorithms is used jain and kumar 2007 this hybrid model is applied to the six reservoir system of great karun in iran to demonstrate its effectiveness the rest of this paper is structured as follows section 2 provides a framework for multistage hedging policy defining two separate hedging stages and introduces an algorithm to incorporate uncertain inflow forecast into the reservoir model as a prerequisite for hybrid model the method for developing forecast model is described in this section also the case study of the great karun system is presented here subsequently the impacts of variable flow pattern effective time horizon of forecast model and operation performances compared to conventional hedging policy and standard operation policy are discussed in the section 3 finally section 4 is presented 2 methodology hedging policy avoids severe damages by accepting smaller deficiency ranges over a long period obviously the basic assumption i e cyclic hydrologic processes is violated in terms of long term nonstationarity where total performances may be declined due to the lack of insight about the future flow patterns shih and revelle 1994 this study aims at driving a two phase hedging rule curve tphrc for a multi reservoir system which incorporate future conditions governing the operation but first a brief description about how to solve the conventional hedging rule curve chrc is given 2 1 conventional hedging rule curve in the discrete hedging policy it is crucial to clarify how to define hedging rules to make the system more flexible two monthly parametric rule curves s target s firm are defined for each reservoir in the system with an independent allocation rate belonged to each zone the optimization problem of multi reservoir system is defined as follows kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 1 minimize z s firm n 12 s ta rget n 12 n 1 n k 1 k t 1 t r k n t d k n t d k n t 2 2 s t 1 n s t n q t n p t n r t n e t n spill t n 3 spill t n max 0 s t 1 n s max n 4 s min n s t n s max n t 1 t where z total squared relative deficit tsrd n

rule curve of reservoir n containing 12 adjustable levels more than which there is spillage eq 1 is solved using a coupled simulation optimization model discussed next as it is partly common with suggested two phase hedging policy the multireservoir operation model presented as eqs 1 4 is solved in the form of a constrained problem so the penalty method is used to replace this problem with an unconstrained problem whose solution ideally converges to the solution of the original problem reid 1996 2 2 two phase hedging rule curve as shown in fig 1 proposed policy consists of two hedging phases in which we catch a glimpse of future conditions in addition to conventional hedging levels in the first phase some allocation coefficients are used in order to manage release rate according to hedging levels which are determined itself looking back at historical time series shih and revelle 1994 at the second phase we catch a glimpse into future conditions as a secondary simulation process is added to the system in other words reservoirs system is simulated again at the beginning of each month and secondary hedging process adjust release rate again looking into near future performances this simulation is based on standard operation policy sop hence two monthly parametric levels are introduced for future performance for each reservoir between the minimum and maximum possible rates these levels are represented by fpl 1 n 12 and fpl 2 n 12 future performance level containing 12 adjustable levels which divide the reservoir performance into three ranges as shown in fig 1 the objective function is similar to eq 1 with the same physical constraints but with more decision variables 5 minimize z s firm n 12 s target n 12 fpl 1 n 12 fpl 2 n 12 n 1 n k 1 k t 1 t r k n t d k n t d k n t 2 to each fpl of each reservoir a secondary allocation coefficient is introduced to modify release rate looking ahead which are quantified in such a way that the two phase hedging rule curve follows three rules below to find an optimal solution for a multi stage multi reservoir operation problem fig 1 1 if reservoir water level is in zone1 i a secondary hedging process must preserve water storage 2 if reservoir water level is in zone2 i b secondary hedging process must make a balance between water storage and release rate 3 if reservoir water level is in zone3 i c secondary hedging process could increase release rate to improve operation performances as much as possible according to fig 1 α i j and β i j are allocation coefficients of first and second phase and i a b c and j a b c stand for the zone of these hedging phases respectively all these rules above are met according to the values of β i j which somehow are dependent on both storage water level and fpl s simultaneously in other words the values of β i j in higher reservoir levels are greater than lower levels which leads to more hedging to compensate this with desirable future conditions and vice versa hence an independent secondary coefficient is defined for each fpl devided by first hedging zones e g β b a is the coefficient when the water level is in zone b s firm s s rarget and fpl is in zone a fpl 1 fpl fpl max in this case the total decision variables are increased as two fpl s are devoted for each reservoir fpls which act as a new trigger for secondary hedging process refer to the reservoir relative deficit as eq 6 kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 6 rd t 1 t d t r t d t where rd stands for the reservoir relative deficit d t is the reservoir demands r t and t are total release and operation period respectively this index is used as a criterion for the additional proposed simulation which is based on sop al jawad and tanyimboh 2017 tphrc consists of two independent simulation process hedging rule according to water level for phase one and according to fpl s of sop simulation for phase two to assess the performance of system against each set of decision variables i e s firm n 12 s target n 12 fpl 1 n 12 fpl 2 n 12 a coupled simulation models are implemented it adopts any random set of decision variables within 0 1 decoded them in the range of normal water level nwl and minimum operation level mol for rule curves and fpl min and fpl max for fpls satisfies the physical constraints and determines the reservoirs release rates according to the following decision steps 7 r t n x α a n t d n t cwl is in zone a α b n t d n t cwl is in zone b α c n t d n t cwl is in zone c 8 r t n main β i a n t r t n x fpv is in zone a i a b c β i b n t r t n x fpv is in zone b i a b c β i c n t r t n x fpv is in zone c i a b c where r t n x is release rate in phase one r t n main is the total release rate as the output of tphrc cwl is current water level and fpv is future performance value next step is to allocate reservoir release to demand nodes which is done using conditional commands embedded in script based on priorities finally following efficiency indexes are determined for further evaluations kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 9 rel 1 i 1 nd df i t 10 rel q t 1 t r t t 1 t d t 11 λ max max max d t r i t i 1 t d t t 1 12 where rel is reliability rel q is quantitative reliability λ max is maximum vulnerability nd is number of deficits df i is duration of failure i and others are according to previous description finally the objective function value is inserted into optimization model to derive the optimal rule curves and fpls a self adaptive genetic algorithm holland 1973 with tournament selection deb et al 2002 and blend crossover eshelman and schaffer 1993 operators is developed all the physical constraints are embedded into this forecast simulation optimization model 2 3 effective forecast horizon to evaluate proposed tphrc in detail the question comes to mind how long the second hedging phase could be effective in other words how long does the forecast horizon affect the decision made in the second phase the system is simulated from the beginning of each month to a certain future horizon using sop policy hence this time interval must be cleared logically obviously the higher this parameter the more information is obtained from the distant future which makes decisions more reliable on the other hand the higher forecast horizon imposes more uncertainty to forecast model which can violate release decision made from reliable values to handle this problem an exterior optimization model is developed in which a matrix of eq 12 is optimized simultaneously with the interior decision variables 12 h h 1 1 h 1 2 h 2 1 h 2 2 h 1 3 h 2 3 h 3 1 h 4 1 h 3 2 h 4 2 h 3 3 h 4 3 where h i j stands for the effective horizons of season i and month j minimum value of h i j could be 1 and the maximum could be 12 as the forecast accuracy drops due to the longer horizon this constraint originates from potential uncertainties imposed to forecast model the exterior optimizer has a same objective function with eq 5 but with a different constraint 13 i 1 12 r i n 12 0 6 n 1 number of inflow node where r i n is the correlation coefficient of forecast model in the month i and inflow node n this constraint is set to avoid all members of matrix h become 12 the longer the h the more uncertainty and of course the more forecast error so the exterior optimizer tends to choose longer h to have better insight about the future while the satisfaction of this constraint causes h to have reasonable accuracy on average which is considered in the form of correlation coefficient since r 0 6 is determined as a criteria for middle range regression taylor 1990 this constraint ensures the average accuracy better than middle range models indeed it keeps the trade off balanced between the longer horizon with better future insight and shorter horizon with less uncertainty to solve this problem similar genetic algorithm is developed which considers fitness function and constraint violation simultaneously the flowchart of procedure for tphrc is shown in fig 2 as we can see this model consists of two independent optimization model the interior is set to find the best operating rules in terms of hedging levels and future performance level while the exterior optimizer finds the matrix h as the effective forecast horizon which determines how long the future condition can affect operation performances it is obvious that for each set of exterior decision variables the interior optimization problem is completely solved resulting to a composite optimization problem 2 4 forecast model this section briefly describes the development of streamflow forecast model as a prerequisite for tphrc to drive the best model a data driven structure is introduced according to fig 3 to forecast the streamflow within the coming 1 12 months ahead through the steps of feature selection learning model and skills evaluation fig 3 consists of two independent sections feature selection and learning model the upper side illustrates a wrapper based feature selection mechanism which uses an evolutionary optimization at the end the adaboost algorithm can be seen as learning algorithm which uses a combination of weaker sub models all these sections are discussed in detail below 2 5 feature selection to identify the effective predictors a wrapper based model dash and liu 1997 consists of a binary ga as optimizer and a multi layer perceptron mcculloch and pitts 1990 as learner is implemented it adopts any random set of potential predictors using the binary numbers of 0 and 1 inserts it to the learning model and returns the evaluation indices of forecast to the optimizer if a member equals to 0 it is eliminated from the potential features vector finally a vector with minimum error and length is determined as effective predictors this problem is mathematically simplified as the following which is a summation of two opposing objectives including forecast error and number of features selected 14 z fs min rrmse 1 γ n f where z fs stands for the objective function of feature selection rrmse is relative root mean square error as a criteria indicating forecast performance n f is the number of features selected and γ is a constant coefficient which reflects the cost of features added to the system this parameter determines how many features are required which acts as an adjustable button for optimization problem the higher γ results in the lower number of selected features with the same objective function an appropriate value of γ which is determined using trial and error could express the trade off between rrmse and n f since conventionally higher n f makes the model more flexible and results in fewer rrmse and vice versa 2 6 learning model streamflow forecast is quite hard to capture all the runoff characteristics due to a wide range of effective parameters which might be neglected within the physical models thus utilization of data driven model is inevitable in which we can use weighted samples to focus learning on the most complicated hydrologic features and merging predictors with weighted votes to develop a robust forecast model to drive such a model an ensemble learning structure in the form of adaboost rt schapire 2013 is introduced to make a weighted connection between effective predictors identified before and streamflow time series through the following semi code determination of threshold 0 1 to identify correct and incorrect predictions determination of initial sample weights 15 w t i 1 n for all i training of all weak learners n with weighted samples calculating absolute relative error for each sample as 16 are t i f t x i y i y i calculating the error rate of f t x and σ t 17 ε t are t i w t i 18 σ t ε t n where n power coefficient linear updating the sample weights and repeat the steps until t t 19 w t 1 i w t i w t β t if are t i 1 otherwise calculating the final output for test data as 20 f fin x t log 1 σ t f t x t log 1 σ t where is threshold to identify incorrect samples w t i is the weight of sample i in time t n is the number of weak learners are t i is the absolute relative error of sample i in time t ε t is the error rate in time t σ t is the powered of ε t β t is the weights updating parameter and f fin is the network output for test data x as adaboost rt algorithm uses a stepwise learning process to gradually improve performances it is required to use a weak learner model to prevent overestimation in other words a strong learner may end up a well fitted model just for training stage which could weaken the results for test data regarding this as the same with the proposed feature selection model multi layer perceptron is applied to estimate correct and incorrect prediction as mlp is known to be a strong learner some of its parameters such as number of neurons are altered to generate a weak learner to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed forecast model three statistical indices including correlation coefficient r willmott wi and relative root mean square error rrmse are implemented willmott 1981 shamseldin 1997 legates and mccabe 1999 in this study two data groups are used to develop forecast model 1 streamflow time series entering the system through inflow nodes and 2 oceanic atmospheric teleconnection indices which are the quantified effects of macro climatic processes on different parts of the earth according to the literature there is an autocorrelation property between the various time lags of streamflow time series which is diminished as the time interval increases considering this property we only used streamflow time series to forecast 1 month ahead ashrafi et al 2020 for higher horizons in which the autocorrelation is less effective oceanic atmospheric teleconnection indices are added to the potential predictors the procedure is as follows a for 1 month ahead streamflow time series are firstly decomposed into components of average and detail using discrete wavelet transform to identify the hidden variation frequencies then the approximate component of last layer with all detail components which are equivalent to initial time series are inserted into feature selection model as potential predictors in 1 month horizon for each component the lags of 1 10 are selected as potential predictors which will be determined precisely in feature selection model next steps are learning and evaluation process cleared before b for longer horizons oceanic atmospheric teleconnection indices are used as potential predictors without any lags the effective lags will be finally determined using correlation coefficients dwt adopts the form of eq 21 polikar 1996 21 ψ a b t γ s 1 s 0 a 2 ψ t b γ 0 s 0 a s 0 a where ψ is the mother wavelet a and b are integers representing the value of dilation and translation of the wavelet respectively s 0 denotes a dilation step whose value is unchanged and is greater than 1 and γ 0 symbolizes the location variable whose value is greater than zero generally for practical reasons the values for s 0 and γ 0 are chosen to be 2 and 1 respectively which is the dwt dyadic grid arrangement i e integer powers of two logarithmic scaling of the translations and dilations mallat 1989 if a time series exhibits discrete properties with a value of x t occurring at a discrete time t the wavelet coefficient becomes partal and küçük 2006 22 w ψ a b 1 2 a 2 t 0 n 1 x t ψ t 2 a b the wavelet coefficient for the dwt is calculated at the scale s 2 a and location γ 2 a b revealing the variety of signals at different scales and locations kamruzzaman et al 2014 since most inflow data is sampled in discrete intervals it makes sense to use dwt kamruzzaman et al 2014 concluded that the haar wavelet makes outputs more compliant with natural oscillations based on quadratic waves a level of decomposition is another fundamental parameter as each decomposition level indicates a band of frequency but the maximum number of levels j max with which a signal can be decomposed is determined using eq 23 de artigas et al 2006 23 j max log 2 n n w 1 where n is the signal length and n w is an indicator of filter associated with mother wavelet 2 7 case study to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model it was implemented for the six reservoir great karun multi reservoir system in iran according to fig 4 as shown there are 10 inflow nodes which the forecast model is developed to estimate the inflows entering the system thorough them table 1 the total demands are classified into four groups of environmental domestic irrigation and others having priorities 1 2 3 and 4 respectively to make the system easier the demands are considered lumped which are located downstream of each reservoir also there are three independent demand nodes at the upstream of dez karun 4 and at the intersection of dez and karun rivers the system configuration is mathematically scripted in visual basic using the hierarchical analysis to express how the system components are connected all rule curves are developed for a 58 year time period from october 1957 to december 2015 to evaluate the performance of operating policies 70 of data are used in optimization and the remaining are used in the simulation to develop the forecast model a similar period from october 1957 to december 2015 of inflow time series and oceanic atmospheric teleconnection indices are used according to table 2 as 70 of them for training 15 for validation and 15 for testing the model recent studies showed that these indices are more effective in this area than others so in order to reduce calculation cost the indices of table 2 are used as potential predictors for longer horizons sigaroodi et al 2014 3 results the proposed forecast model is defined including a wrapper based feature selection model and an adaboost rt ensemble structure the feature selection model uses mlp and binary ga as a central learner and optimizer respectively in the forecast for 1 month ahead the only potential predictors are streamflow wavelet components with corresponding lags through some initial try and error on the dwt parameters and checking the eq 21 the decomposition level was decided to be 4 the dwt was run and eight new variables are gained including four approximate variables and four detail variables for each node the approximate component of layer 4 and the detail components of layers 1 4 were determined as potential predictors since the sum of them was equivalent with initial streamflow these variables with the lags of 1 10 are inserted into the feature selection model in order to identify effective parameter combination against streamflow of 1 month ahead this resulted in 50 5 variables 10 lags binary decision variables which are similar for all ten nodes for horizons more than 1 month 12 teleconnection indices were considered as potential predictors so the number of binary decision variables were chosen as 12 according to sensitivity analyses the population size and the mutation ratio of ga were selected as 180 0 021 for 1 month ahead and 50 0 022 for longer horizons in the both feature selection model the multi layer perceptron with 4 and 10 neurons were used respectively resulted from trial and error this cyclic process was run several times and finally the effective features are achieved for 1 month ahead 24 variables including approximate of layer four and the details of layer one three and four with corresponding lags were determined for all ten streamflow nodes separately for higher horizons the results were shown in table 3 as it was shown oceanic atmospheric teleconnection indices had seasonal effects on streamflow to have better evaluation there are some certain indices in each month which have influence on streamflow so if we separate effective indices for each month the optimization process embedded in feature selection model was not performed properly due to the lack of sample points in other words the number of samples were increased as teleconnection indices were sampled seasonally this condition also prevented us to consider corresponding lags of teleconnection indices into feature selection model so these lags are determined after the effective indices were identified using correlation coefficients evaluation of effective features revealed that there was a similar behavior in all of the streamflow nods as they are all in a relatively similar zones than teleconnection indices sources in addition it was observed that spring flow was mostly influenced by winter rainfalls as similar effective indices has been obtained in this region and confirmed by rahimi et al 2016 similarly the autumn flow was mostly influenced by autumn rainfall in other words the autumn flow was the response of the system to the autumn rainfall this response includes all of the hidden and obvious phenomenon affected rainfall runoff relationship such as soil moisture current base flow former base flow etc investigation of effective indices revealed that the el nino phenomenon played the role of dominant pattern in the autumn the winter indices showed that the streamflow was significantly affected by autumn and winter rainfall it was while there was no effective connection between rainfall and streamflow in summer which might be due to the less influence of rainfall from teleconnection indices in this season the results were confirmed comparing the seasonal volume of rainfall and streamflow in great karun water system which somehow showed the magnitude of rainfall was turned into streamflow following the pattern explained above when the features for each month were identified it was time to drive the effective lags which could determine the forecast horizons so the correlation coefficients of selected features against streamflow of january to december were plotted indeed to strengthen learning process the correlation of streamflow wavelet components as the effective features of 1 month ahead were added for these longer horizons finally significant correlations of lags greater than months 2 12 were selected respectively as effective features of horizons of 2 12 month ahead modaresi et al 2018 luo et al 2019 this was repeated for streamflow of january to december for all the ten streamflow nodes as learning process a series of adaboost rt algorithms are developed divided by forecast horizons for the adaboost rt model the number of weak learners were determined using try and error for example this variable was set to 20 for forecast of 1 month ahead at node 2 another trial and error based parameter was threshold which was set to 19 for 1 month ahead at node 2 this parameter was set to identify the competency of fitted points the higher this value the more errors were ignored influencing regression performance which might cause underestimation from the other hand the small value of required more focus on unsuitable points leading to more efforts increasing the calculation cost the parameter which acts as an adjusting button to have more accuracy with higher cost or lower accuracy with lower cost is determined using trial and error another point was about the dataset each weak learner was trained and validated using 70 and 15 of dataset respectively next in order to identify the points which are not well trained unsuitable points the addition of the train and validation data are used to test these weak learners according to adaboost rt algorithm in other words testing of each weak learner is done with the same data set finally when the weight of weak learners were determined and all of the unsuitable points were inserted into training process the total model including all trained weak learners were retested using final 15 of dataset as mentioned before a multi layer perceptron was used as weak learners at the adaboost rt algorithm since mlp was known as strong learner the number of neurons in hidden layer were set using trial and error in order to create a weak learner for example this number was set to 6 for forecast of 1 month ahead at node 2 all of these steps were repeated for horizons 1 12 in each node three performance criteria i e r wi and rrmse evaluated the model forecast during the verification period these criteria for forecast horizons of 1 and 6 were illustrated in fig 5 as shown adaboost rt algorithm performed well tending to attain slightly better indices especially for shorter horizons than simple learning process embedded into feature selection model for example combining the ability of different learners ultimately improved the rrmse by 12 for 1 month ahead at node 2 also we can see 9 improvement in rrmse for 6 months ahead at node 2 fig 5 showed that the performance of linearity in the case of correlation coefficient was acceptable as for 1 month ahead at node 2 with r 0 89 as it is illustrated extending forecast horizons finally reduced performance indices this was raised from the fact that the longer the horizons the less effects of predictors which were more noticeable in 1 month ahead where the autocorrelation was directly related to the time distance modaresi et al 2018 for higher horizons the autocorrelation effects could be neglected as we can see the selected predictors of these horizons from the other hand oceanic atmospheric teleconnection indices were less affected by time distance due to their integrated cyclic behaviors which maintained them more effective even in longer time horizons kalra et al 2013 sigaroodi et al 2014 the forecasted streamflow by adaboost rt models are compared with observed data at 1 6 and 10 lead time for node 2 in fig 6 as shown forecast models showed generally suitable agreement with observed streamflow in study area even in 10 month horizons although for some of the extreme flood events the models did not perform very well this was originated from the nature of data driven models where the number of sample points could significantly influence on fitting performance modaresi et al 2018 another reason is the complex structure of mlp which have a huge number of internal parameters to be calibrated mcculloch and pitts 1990 since the number of extreme flow sample was not enough the central model mlp could not satisfied the fitting of these points from the other hand one advantage of adaboost rt algorithm is to gradually highlight outliers within the training process so as extreme points generally did not satisfy threshold these sample weights were updated as to increase focus on them which were failed due to the lack of samples as cleared before according to the methodology tphrc consists of 24 rule curves and 24 fpls for each reservoir within the system this totally resulted in 288 decision variables which consists 144 rule curves coordinates and 144 for coordinates of fpls for interior ga model in order to optimize the number of decision variables all hedging coefficients α and β have been eliminated from optimization process these coefficients did not change significantly during optimization process and converged to the following values table 4 the values for α and β are in a way that the triple operational rules mentioned earlier were satisfied in order to keep interaction of first and second phases exterior ga consists of 12 decision variables for effective horizons at the beginning of each month by applying a sensitivity analyses the population size mutation ratio and number of generations were decided as 300 0 04 and 500 for interior ga respectively these parameters were set respectively 60 0 02 and 25 for exterior ga the exterior ga was run several times for which the internal optimization was completely performed finally the best effective forecast horizons were achieved in which the best tphrc variables including monthly coordination of rule curves and future performance levels for each reservoir were determined around the best solution z 1048 meanwhile the violation of exterior ga from constraint guarantying the uniform distribution of forecast horizon in vector h was determined as v constraint 0 resulting in z 1048 fig 7 indicates the optimum rule curves of phase one obtained for each reservoir of the studied system fig 7 represents the triple zones of reservoir which determines the first hedging process more evaluations revealed that the hedging levels in the two phase policy were adjusted to be balanced compared to the conventional hedging rules in other words a desirable future condition in terms of inflow rate led to upper hedging levels and subsequently lower hedging levels in case of undesirable conditions so the release rate was somehow adjusted with secondary hedging process according to the future performance levels gained in a sop simulation when initial hedging was performed according to reservoir water levels using figures above the system is simulated again from the beginning of each month to a certain future horizon using sop simulation fig 8 represents the optimized fpls determining second hedging phase these figures indicate the inflow perspective of near future in a triple sector of desirable middle and critical conditions belonged to the green brown and red colors respectively in the green area the release rate determined in the first phase will be slightly increased multiplying by an incremental coefficient into the allocated demands while in the brown and red colors reflecting undesirable conditions the output of first hedging phase will be decreased using a reducing coefficient which is less in the critical state fig 8 also visualizes how these triple zones have been changed along different months as it is clear the fpls are a kind of rule curve in which the superiority of each zone is directly related to the selection possibility as a result greater green zone reflects desirable future inflow rates which could make the management more flexible while greater brown and red zones reflect undesirable conditions similar to the rising part of a rule curve for example the fpls in december for karun 3 is such that the relative deficit range of 40 is desirable which led to more allocation than first hedging phase meanwhile in the june relative deficit of 11 is considered as red zone reflecting critical conditions in which it is more likely to have a reducing allocation coefficient in the second hedging phase more evaluation indicates that the fpls trend is changed from desirable to critical during the water year which may be due to the distribution of rainfall patterns in the study area as mentioned earlier in the second phase the system was simulated from the beginning of each month to a certain future horizon h i j using sop policy table 5 shows these effective horizons for oct sep resulted from the exterior optimization problem of eq 5 and eq 13 evaluating the effective horizons of table 5 revealed that the average accuracy of forecast model was provided in terms of correlation coefficient which was defined as a constraint in eq 13 for ten inflow nodes it is observed that the upcoming streamflow could influence periodically on operation states as the maximum horizon was gained for the first month of the year then it continued to middle of the year following a downward trend this cycle was repeated for the second half of the year fig 9 shows the system upcoming streamflow followed a sinusoidal pattern which is up down at the beginning of the year the further going forward the upward trend decreased to the point where a down up pattern was formed more evaluations cleared that all the effective horizons were determined in such a way that the trend breaking point was within the range leading to a balanced amount of streamflow at the beginning of the year breaking point was formed at a longer distance resulting in higher effective horizon and farther balance point which could be originated from the higher volume of trend in line flows in the middle of the year flow trends neutralized each other resulting in a closer breaking and balance point this cycle is repeated for april to september effective forecast horizons also followed within year demand fluctuations similar to fig 9 more discussion cleared that the demand fluctuates in the opposite direction where there is a downward pattern at the beginning of the year which is followed by an upward trend at the middle of the year this pattern also results in the same breaking and balance point which confirms the effective forecast horizons of table 5 another point is about the fpls in fig 8 as it is observed more desirable perspectives about coming inflows led to greater green zone or somehow more probability of future positive effects for example in october where upward trend is superior within the 9 month range ahead the green zone or desirable part of fpl is greater in all reservoirs for more investigation the conventional hedging and the standard operation policy were implemented to the selected system and compared with the proposed tphrc table 6 reports the system performance indices for three models for the entire period of simulation the standard operation policy obtained tsrd as 1350 with about 22 6 reliability of satisfying water demands this index was improved by 10 and 20 respectively for chrc and tphrc as it is clear having a glance into the near future condition made the management more flexible the standard policy systematically maximizes the reliability of the system whereas in the chrc and tphrc similar to other hedging strategies the purpose is to minimize the total squared relative deficit which somehow is related to severity of shortages ashrafi 2021 so the vulnerability and quantitative reliability were improved in both hedging policies this table also visualizes that the effects of coming streamflow were more sensitive into these volume based indices which could be inferred from the second hedging phase embedded in tphrc according to the proposed methodology secondary control was based on the fpls which were dependent on relative deficit so this dependency improved vulnerability more than 5 comparing with chrc fig 10 represents how the applied operating rules including chrc sop and tphrc manage the water deficit over the last 10 years of simulation period in these figures the non white cells show failures the total system deficit of each period was also represented using a color spectrum in non white cells one or more deficit is occurred according to these figures the system has less failure following sop rule than others which could be determined by counting white cells but these failures occurred in higher intensities that originated from the definition of the sop from the other hand hedging policy resulted in more failures with lower intensities which was highlighted in tphrc where glancing into the future condition reduced the number of intensified failures reflected in brighter cells the intensity of deficit is so crucial for some demands like irrigation which is informally about 25 30 for great karun system najl et al 2016 on this basis three rules of chrc sop and tphrc could be deeper compared as illustrated in fig 10 the quantity of total failures of sop is less compared to hedging policies however tphrc outperforms the two others in handling the failures the reason could be investigated on the basis of hedging policy to supply demands as much as possible hedging policy tends to evaluate the demands fluctuation during the entire simulation period and keep the water in the reservoir wherever is needed for a balanced allocation which causes lower intensity also comparing two hedging policies of chrc and tphrc the fact is revealed that the awareness about the streamflow in the near future made the system more flexible to increase or decrease water release over the entire period which somehow prevents intensified deficits 4 conclusion in this study a forecast simulation optimization approach was introduced to drive the optimum rule curves for multi reservoir system the proposed hedging based model was developed defining two independent phases the first step was a conventional hedging policy based on reservoir water level whilst the secondary step benefited from an extra simulation process in the near future using sop to develop a forecast model a hybrid structure was introduced including a feature selection model to identify effective parameters and adaboost rt algorithm to perform learning process in order to determine effective forecast horizon an exterior optimizer was defined in which any random values of forecast horizons were optimized simultaneously with the interior decision variables the configuration of system and demands were mathematically scripted in visual basic using a hierarchical analysis to express how the system components are connected all physical constraints were systematically satisfied in the models used in simulation outside the simulation models of phase one and two an elitism ga was developed to optimize the reservoir rule curves and future performance levels with the objective function of total squared relative deficit also a self adaptive ga was developed for exterior optimizer to minimize total squared relative deficit subjected to a desirable forecast performance of effective horizons the model was implemented for a real six reservoir system located in iran finally the performance of the system was compared with the sop and conventional hedging policy the sop had the best reliability in satisfying water demands in reality the operators can decide to operate the system considering historical time series hoping to repeat in the future generally the basis of rule curve optimization is dependent to this event while the probability of historical events is decreasing due to the effects of climate change and land usage which drastically violates the system performances from desirable values these factors were reflected in nonstationary time series using proposed model it is possible to incorporate future conditions into the real time operation but these future effects are restricted to a certain distance due to the limitation of forecast model in this regard there is a trade off between longer distance with more information and more uncertainty and lower distance with less information and less uncertainty using exterior optimizer it is possible to investigate this trade off systematically to determine effective future distance influencing real time decisions in other words by the proposed model a comprehensive platform is provided to optimally merge future conditions with present states using an extra hedging phase which is based on future performance levels furthermore this future awareness increases the system flexibility resulting in lower intensified deficit comparing with conventional hedging and sop for the forecast model it is observed that the feature selection model identified effective parameters against streamflow for different horizons also adaboost rt algorithm performed well into regression problems especially for shorter horizons different climate conditions are usually concealed into operating rules optimized using historical data as a result these rules are just able to handle similar future conditions in other words long term fundamental changes in the system due to the climate change and human interference caused doubts about the assumption of hydrologic stationarity especially in the design period so a hedging rule policy equipped with a forecast model could have better control on the system performance under the nonstationary streamflow conditions moreover to have successful operation in a multi reservoir system each reservoir manager must observe operational rules carefully to gain this purpose all operators need to be aware how the future conditions could affect their local real time decisions to extend the idea behind this paper it is suggested to introduce a different structure to incorporate future conditions into current states it is also suggested to develop a combinatorial policy according to different climate change scenarios and then interpolate future conditions using a forecast model in addition it should be note that the proposed two phase policy could be applied in a real time operation which use a rolling strategy to make the system more flexible challenging with coming dry and wet conditions formatting of funding sources this research did not receive any

9578,long term changes in reservoir inflow due to climate changes and human interference violate the assumptions of hydrologic stationarity especially in the reservoir design utilization of uncertain prediction into a reservoir operating rule curves somehow reflects the challenges that imposed by nonstationary conditions this study proposes a hedging based policy incorporated forecast term to manage release decisions in two separate phases hedging is applied firstly regarding to reservoir water level similar to conventional hedging rules and secondary according to an extra simulation in the near future to determine the time interval of future effects an exterior optimization model is introduced to handle the trade off between forecast uncertainty and future information which imposed by forecast horizon future inflows are forecasted introducing a model including a wrapper based feature selection method and adaboost rt as a learning algorithm the results of applying the model to a real six reservoir system in iran showed that incorporating future inflows into the real time decisions significantly improves the total squared relative deficit about 20 and 10 compared to conventional hedging rule curve chrc and standard operation policy as objective function also having a glance at the near future reduces the vulnerability of the system about 5 and 27 respectively against chrc and sop the results also showed that although the sop reaches to a best reliability of satisfying water demands in total system as 31 and 27 better than chrc and the proposed two phase policy but the number of intensified failures was higher than two others which somehow influences on volume based indices like vulnerability keywords hedging policy forecast uncertainty nonstationarity climate change adaboost algorithm teleconnection indices data availability all data models and code are available from the corresponding author by request 1 introduction streamflow stationarity is one of the main assumptions during water resources operating rule extraction which its accuracy is impressed by some factors such as climate change milly et al 2008 from a statistical point of view the long term average of streamflow has a constant probability of occurrence in a stationary condition therefore historical streamflow time series can be used confidently as future flow patterns however this conditions rarely occur as urban development plans climate change deforestation etc can alter the rainfall runoff components which lead to hydrological variations loucks and van beek 2005 many prevalent models satisfy the stationary assumption by using historical time series as well as data generation nonstationarity violates the initial assumption and greatly imposes challenges to the policies resulted from these models in general reservoir operation could be affected severely by the nonstationary the great karun water resources system located in iran suffers from such problems ashrafi and mahmoudi 2022 to overcome this challenge operation policy must somehow take into account inflow nonstationarity aiming to reach higher accuracy therefore many researches are being investigated to somehow solve this problem xu et al 2015 proposed rules for multi stage optimum hedging policy incorporating uncertain predictions for large reservoirs with multi layer flow regulation capacities three predefined rules are derived for determination of optimum solution in miyun reservoir in china the results showed that the reservoir performance under hedging policy benefiting from arima predictions was better than actual operation and sop zhao et al 2014 developed optimum hedging rules for reservoir flood control under hydrological nonstationarity using hydro economic and mathematical analysis they clustered flood volume into three groups based on intensity and allocated some part of reservoir for each one the results showed that hedging policy had better performance to balance marginal value of flood management resources under nonstationarity compared with other policy yang and ng 2017 studied the accuracy of operating rules against the inflow time series and evaluated the sustainability of a policy against nonstationary flows feng et al 2017 investigated the alteration of operating indices under different scenarios of inflow they reflected effects of nonstationarity into variable scenarios such as the shift in the mean the coefficient of variation c v and seasonality results showed that increasing of mean of inflow changes the operating rules and it increases the water release and vice versa while the shift of c v has little impact on operating rules also the seasonality changes operating rules are in opposite directions during refill and drawdown periods liu et al 2019 applied a bayesian deep learning method to study the influence of inflow uncertainty on reservoir operation rules which considers both model parameter uncertainty and inflow uncertainty the uncertainty estimation results showed that the influence of inflow uncertainty on reservoir operation is greater than model parameter uncertainty the results also emphasized in order to keep operating policy balanced some statistical alteration must be made corresponding to inflow components gavahi et al 2019 presented a forecast based adaptive real time operation model atrom for bukan reservoir which consists of an adaptive neuro fuzzy system and an inflow forecast model to determine optimize release rate the results demonstrate that proposed model attains an objective function very close to the best possible value than can be reached by a perfect foresight about the future streamflow jin and lee 2019 aimed to present a discrete hedging rule running through several phases to introduce an effective method for water supply operation the results showed that the derived rules based on beginning storage were placed higher than others which induced earlier rationing of water supply allawi et al 2019 attempted to develop an integrated forecasting based operational model in which the reservoir inflow and evaporation were forecasted and a simulation optimization model generated optimized rule curves findings revealed the necessity of forecast term to achieve more accurate rules peng et al 2019 presented a platform consisting of a rainfall runoff model and a stochastic dynamic programming method for reservoir operation the results demonstrated that hydropower generation can be increased compared to traditional rule curves which indicated that the use of forecast considerably facilitates the performance of operating rules wan et al 2019 established the linkage of rule curves and hedging theory by analyzing three fundamental problems surrounding the design of conventional rule curves namely the law and design of water supply rule curves the determination of flood control storage and the division of refill and drawdown circle the results showed that based on the historical records the rule curves can be interpreted as a specific expression of hedging theory ashrafi et al 2020 compared two polynomial and hedging rules with and without forecast term to identify the effects of inflow forecast in a real time decision making the results highlighted the role of inflows on operation policies they also concluded that the longer forecast horizons could have better effects on real time decision making xu et al 2020 developed a two phase stochastic optimization model to determine the optimal conservation level for flood water by minimizing the risks from both floods and water shortages the results showed that the hedging rules outperformed the capacity constrained pre release rules for conserving flood water without increasing the flood risk all these researches reflect the influence of nonstationarity into some scenarios and acknowledged that the rules must be adjusted against these variation patterns from the other hand adaptive management has been used as an alternative to handle nonstationarity in various resource management topics such as brekke 2009 these studies somehow apply adaptive management in which sequential decision are made based on updated forecast adaptive management reflects forecast uncertainty into an adaptive system and combined common weakness of hydrology and water resource management one of the big challenges of adaptive management is how to approach forecast uncertainty into optimization models vicuna et al 2010 combined climate change scenarios into sample stochastic dynamic programming for three case studies since then hedging policy has been widely discussed in reservoir operation fields draper and lund 2004 used hedging policy to make balance between storage and release benefits you and cai 2008 introduced a two stage model that incorporate future inflow imposed by uncertainty zhao et al 2011 explicitly assign hydrological forecast into a two stage stochastic model followed by forecast uncertainties the effects of three typical constraints i e mass balance nonnegative release and storage constraints were analyzed under both certain and uncertain conditions results showed higher uncertainty level in the future led to stricter hedging to make the model compatible with unknown future conditions although the two stage hedging policy is theoretically crucial a multistage optimization model incorporating forecast uncertainty is required for adaptive operation due to the interaction between current decision and future stages on the other recent studies just incorporated the future conditions in terms of some scenario based solutions which turns variable inflow patterns into some scenarios entering to reservoirs so in order to propose a novel structure for multi stage model which considers future inflow patterns this paper introduces a new multistage reservoir operation model which includes two separate hedging phases using predicted streamflow the first hedging phase is similar to conventional hedging stage based on reservoir water level while in the second phase a future based hedging policy is assigned according to forecast model in each stage more importantly coupled forecast model is updated after each time step using a rolling time framework and inserts forecast term as an input to the reservoir model to develop forecast model a data driven method based on machine learning concepts using feature selection and ensemble learning algorithms is used jain and kumar 2007 this hybrid model is applied to the six reservoir system of great karun in iran to demonstrate its effectiveness the rest of this paper is structured as follows section 2 provides a framework for multistage hedging policy defining two separate hedging stages and introduces an algorithm to incorporate uncertain inflow forecast into the reservoir model as a prerequisite for hybrid model the method for developing forecast model is described in this section also the case study of the great karun system is presented here subsequently the impacts of variable flow pattern effective time horizon of forecast model and operation performances compared to conventional hedging policy and standard operation policy are discussed in the section 3 finally section 4 is presented 2 methodology hedging policy avoids severe damages by accepting smaller deficiency ranges over a long period obviously the basic assumption i e cyclic hydrologic processes is violated in terms of long term nonstationarity where total performances may be declined due to the lack of insight about the future flow patterns shih and revelle 1994 this study aims at driving a two phase hedging rule curve tphrc for a multi reservoir system which incorporate future conditions governing the operation but first a brief description about how to solve the conventional hedging rule curve chrc is given 2 1 conventional hedging rule curve in the discrete hedging policy it is crucial to clarify how to define hedging rules to make the system more flexible two monthly parametric rule curves s target s firm are defined for each reservoir in the system with an independent allocation rate belonged to each zone the optimization problem of multi reservoir system is defined as follows kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 1 minimize z s firm n 12 s ta rget n 12 n 1 n k 1 k t 1 t r k n t d k n t d k n t 2 2 s t 1 n s t n q t n p t n r t n e t n spill t n 3 spill t n max 0 s t 1 n s max n 4 s min n s t n s max n t 1 t where z total squared relative deficit tsrd n

rule curve of reservoir n containing 12 adjustable levels more than which there is spillage eq 1 is solved using a coupled simulation optimization model discussed next as it is partly common with suggested two phase hedging policy the multireservoir operation model presented as eqs 1 4 is solved in the form of a constrained problem so the penalty method is used to replace this problem with an unconstrained problem whose solution ideally converges to the solution of the original problem reid 1996 2 2 two phase hedging rule curve as shown in fig 1 proposed policy consists of two hedging phases in which we catch a glimpse of future conditions in addition to conventional hedging levels in the first phase some allocation coefficients are used in order to manage release rate according to hedging levels which are determined itself looking back at historical time series shih and revelle 1994 at the second phase we catch a glimpse into future conditions as a secondary simulation process is added to the system in other words reservoirs system is simulated again at the beginning of each month and secondary hedging process adjust release rate again looking into near future performances this simulation is based on standard operation policy sop hence two monthly parametric levels are introduced for future performance for each reservoir between the minimum and maximum possible rates these levels are represented by fpl 1 n 12 and fpl 2 n 12 future performance level containing 12 adjustable levels which divide the reservoir performance into three ranges as shown in fig 1 the objective function is similar to eq 1 with the same physical constraints but with more decision variables 5 minimize z s firm n 12 s target n 12 fpl 1 n 12 fpl 2 n 12 n 1 n k 1 k t 1 t r k n t d k n t d k n t 2 to each fpl of each reservoir a secondary allocation coefficient is introduced to modify release rate looking ahead which are quantified in such a way that the two phase hedging rule curve follows three rules below to find an optimal solution for a multi stage multi reservoir operation problem fig 1 1 if reservoir water level is in zone1 i a secondary hedging process must preserve water storage 2 if reservoir water level is in zone2 i b secondary hedging process must make a balance between water storage and release rate 3 if reservoir water level is in zone3 i c secondary hedging process could increase release rate to improve operation performances as much as possible according to fig 1 α i j and β i j are allocation coefficients of first and second phase and i a b c and j a b c stand for the zone of these hedging phases respectively all these rules above are met according to the values of β i j which somehow are dependent on both storage water level and fpl s simultaneously in other words the values of β i j in higher reservoir levels are greater than lower levels which leads to more hedging to compensate this with desirable future conditions and vice versa hence an independent secondary coefficient is defined for each fpl devided by first hedging zones e g β b a is the coefficient when the water level is in zone b s firm s s rarget and fpl is in zone a fpl 1 fpl fpl max in this case the total decision variables are increased as two fpl s are devoted for each reservoir fpls which act as a new trigger for secondary hedging process refer to the reservoir relative deficit as eq 6 kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 6 rd t 1 t d t r t d t where rd stands for the reservoir relative deficit d t is the reservoir demands r t and t are total release and operation period respectively this index is used as a criterion for the additional proposed simulation which is based on sop al jawad and tanyimboh 2017 tphrc consists of two independent simulation process hedging rule according to water level for phase one and according to fpl s of sop simulation for phase two to assess the performance of system against each set of decision variables i e s firm n 12 s target n 12 fpl 1 n 12 fpl 2 n 12 a coupled simulation models are implemented it adopts any random set of decision variables within 0 1 decoded them in the range of normal water level nwl and minimum operation level mol for rule curves and fpl min and fpl max for fpls satisfies the physical constraints and determines the reservoirs release rates according to the following decision steps 7 r t n x α a n t d n t cwl is in zone a α b n t d n t cwl is in zone b α c n t d n t cwl is in zone c 8 r t n main β i a n t r t n x fpv is in zone a i a b c β i b n t r t n x fpv is in zone b i a b c β i c n t r t n x fpv is in zone c i a b c where r t n x is release rate in phase one r t n main is the total release rate as the output of tphrc cwl is current water level and fpv is future performance value next step is to allocate reservoir release to demand nodes which is done using conditional commands embedded in script based on priorities finally following efficiency indexes are determined for further evaluations kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 9 rel 1 i 1 nd df i t 10 rel q t 1 t r t t 1 t d t 11 λ max max max d t r i t i 1 t d t t 1 12 where rel is reliability rel q is quantitative reliability λ max is maximum vulnerability nd is number of deficits df i is duration of failure i and others are according to previous description finally the objective function value is inserted into optimization model to derive the optimal rule curves and fpls a self adaptive genetic algorithm holland 1973 with tournament selection deb et al 2002 and blend crossover eshelman and schaffer 1993 operators is developed all the physical constraints are embedded into this forecast simulation optimization model 2 3 effective forecast horizon to evaluate proposed tphrc in detail the question comes to mind how long the second hedging phase could be effective in other words how long does the forecast horizon affect the decision made in the second phase the system is simulated from the beginning of each month to a certain future horizon using sop policy hence this time interval must be cleared logically obviously the higher this parameter the more information is obtained from the distant future which makes decisions more reliable on the other hand the higher forecast horizon imposes more uncertainty to forecast model which can violate release decision made from reliable values to handle this problem an exterior optimization model is developed in which a matrix of eq 12 is optimized simultaneously with the interior decision variables 12 h h 1 1 h 1 2 h 2 1 h 2 2 h 1 3 h 2 3 h 3 1 h 4 1 h 3 2 h 4 2 h 3 3 h 4 3 where h i j stands for the effective horizons of season i and month j minimum value of h i j could be 1 and the maximum could be 12 as the forecast accuracy drops due to the longer horizon this constraint originates from potential uncertainties imposed to forecast model the exterior optimizer has a same objective function with eq 5 but with a different constraint 13 i 1 12 r i n 12 0 6 n 1 number of inflow node where r i n is the correlation coefficient of forecast model in the month i and inflow node n this constraint is set to avoid all members of matrix h become 12 the longer the h the more uncertainty and of course the more forecast error so the exterior optimizer tends to choose longer h to have better insight about the future while the satisfaction of this constraint causes h to have reasonable accuracy on average which is considered in the form of correlation coefficient since r 0 6 is determined as a criteria for middle range regression taylor 1990 this constraint ensures the average accuracy better than middle range models indeed it keeps the trade off balanced between the longer horizon with better future insight and shorter horizon with less uncertainty to solve this problem similar genetic algorithm is developed which considers fitness function and constraint violation simultaneously the flowchart of procedure for tphrc is shown in fig 2 as we can see this model consists of two independent optimization model the interior is set to find the best operating rules in terms of hedging levels and future performance level while the exterior optimizer finds the matrix h as the effective forecast horizon which determines how long the future condition can affect operation performances it is obvious that for each set of exterior decision variables the interior optimization problem is completely solved resulting to a composite optimization problem 2 4 forecast model this section briefly describes the development of streamflow forecast model as a prerequisite for tphrc to drive the best model a data driven structure is introduced according to fig 3 to forecast the streamflow within the coming 1 12 months ahead through the steps of feature selection learning model and skills evaluation fig 3 consists of two independent sections feature selection and learning model the upper side illustrates a wrapper based feature selection mechanism which uses an evolutionary optimization at the end the adaboost algorithm can be seen as learning algorithm which uses a combination of weaker sub models all these sections are discussed in detail below 2 5 feature selection to identify the effective predictors a wrapper based model dash and liu 1997 consists of a binary ga as optimizer and a multi layer perceptron mcculloch and pitts 1990 as learner is implemented it adopts any random set of potential predictors using the binary numbers of 0 and 1 inserts it to the learning model and returns the evaluation indices of forecast to the optimizer if a member equals to 0 it is eliminated from the potential features vector finally a vector with minimum error and length is determined as effective predictors this problem is mathematically simplified as the following which is a summation of two opposing objectives including forecast error and number of features selected 14 z fs min rrmse 1 γ n f where z fs stands for the objective function of feature selection rrmse is relative root mean square error as a criteria indicating forecast performance n f is the number of features selected and γ is a constant coefficient which reflects the cost of features added to the system this parameter determines how many features are required which acts as an adjustable button for optimization problem the higher γ results in the lower number of selected features with the same objective function an appropriate value of γ which is determined using trial and error could express the trade off between rrmse and n f since conventionally higher n f makes the model more flexible and results in fewer rrmse and vice versa 2 6 learning model streamflow forecast is quite hard to capture all the runoff characteristics due to a wide range of effective parameters which might be neglected within the physical models thus utilization of data driven model is inevitable in which we can use weighted samples to focus learning on the most complicated hydrologic features and merging predictors with weighted votes to develop a robust forecast model to drive such a model an ensemble learning structure in the form of adaboost rt schapire 2013 is introduced to make a weighted connection between effective predictors identified before and streamflow time series through the following semi code determination of threshold 0 1 to identify correct and incorrect predictions determination of initial sample weights 15 w t i 1 n for all i training of all weak learners n with weighted samples calculating absolute relative error for each sample as 16 are t i f t x i y i y i calculating the error rate of f t x and σ t 17 ε t are t i w t i 18 σ t ε t n where n power coefficient linear updating the sample weights and repeat the steps until t t 19 w t 1 i w t i w t β t if are t i 1 otherwise calculating the final output for test data as 20 f fin x t log 1 σ t f t x t log 1 σ t where is threshold to identify incorrect samples w t i is the weight of sample i in time t n is the number of weak learners are t i is the absolute relative error of sample i in time t ε t is the error rate in time t σ t is the powered of ε t β t is the weights updating parameter and f fin is the network output for test data x as adaboost rt algorithm uses a stepwise learning process to gradually improve performances it is required to use a weak learner model to prevent overestimation in other words a strong learner may end up a well fitted model just for training stage which could weaken the results for test data regarding this as the same with the proposed feature selection model multi layer perceptron is applied to estimate correct and incorrect prediction as mlp is known to be a strong learner some of its parameters such as number of neurons are altered to generate a weak learner to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed forecast model three statistical indices including correlation coefficient r willmott wi and relative root mean square error rrmse are implemented willmott 1981 shamseldin 1997 legates and mccabe 1999 in this study two data groups are used to develop forecast model 1 streamflow time series entering the system through inflow nodes and 2 oceanic atmospheric teleconnection indices which are the quantified effects of macro climatic processes on different parts of the earth according to the literature there is an autocorrelation property between the various time lags of streamflow time series which is diminished as the time interval increases considering this property we only used streamflow time series to forecast 1 month ahead ashrafi et al 2020 for higher horizons in which the autocorrelation is less effective oceanic atmospheric teleconnection indices are added to the potential predictors the procedure is as follows a for 1 month ahead streamflow time series are firstly decomposed into components of average and detail using discrete wavelet transform to identify the hidden variation frequencies then the approximate component of last layer with all detail components which are equivalent to initial time series are inserted into feature selection model as potential predictors in 1 month horizon for each component the lags of 1 10 are selected as potential predictors which will be determined precisely in feature selection model next steps are learning and evaluation process cleared before b for longer horizons oceanic atmospheric teleconnection indices are used as potential predictors without any lags the effective lags will be finally determined using correlation coefficients dwt adopts the form of eq 21 polikar 1996 21 ψ a b t γ s 1 s 0 a 2 ψ t b γ 0 s 0 a s 0 a where ψ is the mother wavelet a and b are integers representing the value of dilation and translation of the wavelet respectively s 0 denotes a dilation step whose value is unchanged and is greater than 1 and γ 0 symbolizes the location variable whose value is greater than zero generally for practical reasons the values for s 0 and γ 0 are chosen to be 2 and 1 respectively which is the dwt dyadic grid arrangement i e integer powers of two logarithmic scaling of the translations and dilations mallat 1989 if a time series exhibits discrete properties with a value of x t occurring at a discrete time t the wavelet coefficient becomes partal and küçük 2006 22 w ψ a b 1 2 a 2 t 0 n 1 x t ψ t 2 a b the wavelet coefficient for the dwt is calculated at the scale s 2 a and location γ 2 a b revealing the variety of signals at different scales and locations kamruzzaman et al 2014 since most inflow data is sampled in discrete intervals it makes sense to use dwt kamruzzaman et al 2014 concluded that the haar wavelet makes outputs more compliant with natural oscillations based on quadratic waves a level of decomposition is another fundamental parameter as each decomposition level indicates a band of frequency but the maximum number of levels j max with which a signal can be decomposed is determined using eq 23 de artigas et al 2006 23 j max log 2 n n w 1 where n is the signal length and n w is an indicator of filter associated with mother wavelet 2 7 case study to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model it was implemented for the six reservoir great karun multi reservoir system in iran according to fig 4 as shown there are 10 inflow nodes which the forecast model is developed to estimate the inflows entering the system thorough them table 1 the total demands are classified into four groups of environmental domestic irrigation and others having priorities 1 2 3 and 4 respectively to make the system easier the demands are considered lumped which are located downstream of each reservoir also there are three independent demand nodes at the upstream of dez karun 4 and at the intersection of dez and karun rivers the system configuration is mathematically scripted in visual basic using the hierarchical analysis to express how the system components are connected all rule curves are developed for a 58 year time period from october 1957 to december 2015 to evaluate the performance of operating policies 70 of data are used in optimization and the remaining are used in the simulation to develop the forecast model a similar period from october 1957 to december 2015 of inflow time series and oceanic atmospheric teleconnection indices are used according to table 2 as 70 of them for training 15 for validation and 15 for testing the model recent studies showed that these indices are more effective in this area than others so in order to reduce calculation cost the indices of table 2 are used as potential predictors for longer horizons sigaroodi et al 2014 3 results the proposed forecast model is defined including a wrapper based feature selection model and an adaboost rt ensemble structure the feature selection model uses mlp and binary ga as a central learner and optimizer respectively in the forecast for 1 month ahead the only potential predictors are streamflow wavelet components with corresponding lags through some initial try and error on the dwt parameters and checking the eq 21 the decomposition level was decided to be 4 the dwt was run and eight new variables are gained including four approximate variables and four detail variables for each node the approximate component of layer 4 and the detail components of layers 1 4 were determined as potential predictors since the sum of them was equivalent with initial streamflow these variables with the lags of 1 10 are inserted into the feature selection model in order to identify effective parameter combination against streamflow of 1 month ahead this resulted in 50 5 variables 10 lags binary decision variables which are similar for all ten nodes for horizons more than 1 month 12 teleconnection indices were considered as potential predictors so the number of binary decision variables were chosen as 12 according to sensitivity analyses the population size and the mutation ratio of ga were selected as 180 0 021 for 1 month ahead and 50 0 022 for longer horizons in the both feature selection model the multi layer perceptron with 4 and 10 neurons were used respectively resulted from trial and error this cyclic process was run several times and finally the effective features are achieved for 1 month ahead 24 variables including approximate of layer four and the details of layer one three and four with corresponding lags were determined for all ten streamflow nodes separately for higher horizons the results were shown in table 3 as it was shown oceanic atmospheric teleconnection indices had seasonal effects on streamflow to have better evaluation there are some certain indices in each month which have influence on streamflow so if we separate effective indices for each month the optimization process embedded in feature selection model was not performed properly due to the lack of sample points in other words the number of samples were increased as teleconnection indices were sampled seasonally this condition also prevented us to consider corresponding lags of teleconnection indices into feature selection model so these lags are determined after the effective indices were identified using correlation coefficients evaluation of effective features revealed that there was a similar behavior in all of the streamflow nods as they are all in a relatively similar zones than teleconnection indices sources in addition it was observed that spring flow was mostly influenced by winter rainfalls as similar effective indices has been obtained in this region and confirmed by rahimi et al 2016 similarly the autumn flow was mostly influenced by autumn rainfall in other words the autumn flow was the response of the system to the autumn rainfall this response includes all of the hidden and obvious phenomenon affected rainfall runoff relationship such as soil moisture current base flow former base flow etc investigation of effective indices revealed that the el nino phenomenon played the role of dominant pattern in the autumn the winter indices showed that the streamflow was significantly affected by autumn and winter rainfall it was while there was no effective connection between rainfall and streamflow in summer which might be due to the less influence of rainfall from teleconnection indices in this season the results were confirmed comparing the seasonal volume of rainfall and streamflow in great karun water system which somehow showed the magnitude of rainfall was turned into streamflow following the pattern explained above when the features for each month were identified it was time to drive the effective lags which could determine the forecast horizons so the correlation coefficients of selected features against streamflow of january to december were plotted indeed to strengthen learning process the correlation of streamflow wavelet components as the effective features of 1 month ahead were added for these longer horizons finally significant correlations of lags greater than months 2 12 were selected respectively as effective features of horizons of 2 12 month ahead modaresi et al 2018 luo et al 2019 this was repeated for streamflow of january to december for all the ten streamflow nodes as learning process a series of adaboost rt algorithms are developed divided by forecast horizons for the adaboost rt model the number of weak learners were determined using try and error for example this variable was set to 20 for forecast of 1 month ahead at node 2 another trial and error based parameter was threshold which was set to 19 for 1 month ahead at node 2 this parameter was set to identify the competency of fitted points the higher this value the more errors were ignored influencing regression performance which might cause underestimation from the other hand the small value of required more focus on unsuitable points leading to more efforts increasing the calculation cost the parameter which acts as an adjusting button to have more accuracy with higher cost or lower accuracy with lower cost is determined using trial and error another point was about the dataset each weak learner was trained and validated using 70 and 15 of dataset respectively next in order to identify the points which are not well trained unsuitable points the addition of the train and validation data are used to test these weak learners according to adaboost rt algorithm in other words testing of each weak learner is done with the same data set finally when the weight of weak learners were determined and all of the unsuitable points were inserted into training process the total model including all trained weak learners were retested using final 15 of dataset as mentioned before a multi layer perceptron was used as weak learners at the adaboost rt algorithm since mlp was known as strong learner the number of neurons in hidden layer were set using trial and error in order to create a weak learner for example this number was set to 6 for forecast of 1 month ahead at node 2 all of these steps were repeated for horizons 1 12 in each node three performance criteria i e r wi and rrmse evaluated the model forecast during the verification period these criteria for forecast horizons of 1 and 6 were illustrated in fig 5 as shown adaboost rt algorithm performed well tending to attain slightly better indices especially for shorter horizons than simple learning process embedded into feature selection model for example combining the ability of different learners ultimately improved the rrmse by 12 for 1 month ahead at node 2 also we can see 9 improvement in rrmse for 6 months ahead at node 2 fig 5 showed that the performance of linearity in the case of correlation coefficient was acceptable as for 1 month ahead at node 2 with r 0 89 as it is illustrated extending forecast horizons finally reduced performance indices this was raised from the fact that the longer the horizons the less effects of predictors which were more noticeable in 1 month ahead where the autocorrelation was directly related to the time distance modaresi et al 2018 for higher horizons the autocorrelation effects could be neglected as we can see the selected predictors of these horizons from the other hand oceanic atmospheric teleconnection indices were less affected by time distance due to their integrated cyclic behaviors which maintained them more effective even in longer time horizons kalra et al 2013 sigaroodi et al 2014 the forecasted streamflow by adaboost rt models are compared with observed data at 1 6 and 10 lead time for node 2 in fig 6 as shown forecast models showed generally suitable agreement with observed streamflow in study area even in 10 month horizons although for some of the extreme flood events the models did not perform very well this was originated from the nature of data driven models where the number of sample points could significantly influence on fitting performance modaresi et al 2018 another reason is the complex structure of mlp which have a huge number of internal parameters to be calibrated mcculloch and pitts 1990 since the number of extreme flow sample was not enough the central model mlp could not satisfied the fitting of these points from the other hand one advantage of adaboost rt algorithm is to gradually highlight outliers within the training process so as extreme points generally did not satisfy threshold these sample weights were updated as to increase focus on them which were failed due to the lack of samples as cleared before according to the methodology tphrc consists of 24 rule curves and 24 fpls for each reservoir within the system this totally resulted in 288 decision variables which consists 144 rule curves coordinates and 144 for coordinates of fpls for interior ga model in order to optimize the number of decision variables all hedging coefficients α and β have been eliminated from optimization process these coefficients did not change significantly during optimization process and converged to the following values table 4 the values for α and β are in a way that the triple operational rules mentioned earlier were satisfied in order to keep interaction of first and second phases exterior ga consists of 12 decision variables for effective horizons at the beginning of each month by applying a sensitivity analyses the population size mutation ratio and number of generations were decided as 300 0 04 and 500 for interior ga respectively these parameters were set respectively 60 0 02 and 25 for exterior ga the exterior ga was run several times for which the internal optimization was completely performed finally the best effective forecast horizons were achieved in which the best tphrc variables including monthly coordination of rule curves and future performance levels for each reservoir were determined around the best solution z 1048 meanwhile the violation of exterior ga from constraint guarantying the uniform distribution of forecast horizon in vector h was determined as v constraint 0 resulting in z 1048 fig 7 indicates the optimum rule curves of phase one obtained for each reservoir of the studied system fig 7 represents the triple zones of reservoir which determines the first hedging process more evaluations revealed that the hedging levels in the two phase policy were adjusted to be balanced compared to the conventional hedging rules in other words a desirable future condition in terms of inflow rate led to upper hedging levels and subsequently lower hedging levels in case of undesirable conditions so the release rate was somehow adjusted with secondary hedging process according to the future performance levels gained in a sop simulation when initial hedging was performed according to reservoir water levels using figures above the system is simulated again from the beginning of each month to a certain future horizon using sop simulation fig 8 represents the optimized fpls determining second hedging phase these figures indicate the inflow perspective of near future in a triple sector of desirable middle and critical conditions belonged to the green brown and red colors respectively in the green area the release rate determined in the first phase will be slightly increased multiplying by an incremental coefficient into the allocated demands while in the brown and red colors reflecting undesirable conditions the output of first hedging phase will be decreased using a reducing coefficient which is less in the critical state fig 8 also visualizes how these triple zones have been changed along different months as it is clear the fpls are a kind of rule curve in which the superiority of each zone is directly related to the selection possibility as a result greater green zone reflects desirable future inflow rates which could make the management more flexible while greater brown and red zones reflect undesirable conditions similar to the rising part of a rule curve for example the fpls in december for karun 3 is such that the relative deficit range of 40 is desirable which led to more allocation than first hedging phase meanwhile in the june relative deficit of 11 is considered as red zone reflecting critical conditions in which it is more likely to have a reducing allocation coefficient in the second hedging phase more evaluation indicates that the fpls trend is changed from desirable to critical during the water year which may be due to the distribution of rainfall patterns in the study area as mentioned earlier in the second phase the system was simulated from the beginning of each month to a certain future horizon h i j using sop policy table 5 shows these effective horizons for oct sep resulted from the exterior optimization problem of eq 5 and eq 13 evaluating the effective horizons of table 5 revealed that the average accuracy of forecast model was provided in terms of correlation coefficient which was defined as a constraint in eq 13 for ten inflow nodes it is observed that the upcoming streamflow could influence periodically on operation states as the maximum horizon was gained for the first month of the year then it continued to middle of the year following a downward trend this cycle was repeated for the second half of the year fig 9 shows the system upcoming streamflow followed a sinusoidal pattern which is up down at the beginning of the year the further going forward the upward trend decreased to the point where a down up pattern was formed more evaluations cleared that all the effective horizons were determined in such a way that the trend breaking point was within the range leading to a balanced amount of streamflow at the beginning of the year breaking point was formed at a longer distance resulting in higher effective horizon and farther balance point which could be originated from the higher volume of trend in line flows in the middle of the year flow trends neutralized each other resulting in a closer breaking and balance point this cycle is repeated for april to september effective forecast horizons also followed within year demand fluctuations similar to fig 9 more discussion cleared that the demand fluctuates in the opposite direction where there is a downward pattern at the beginning of the year which is followed by an upward trend at the middle of the year this pattern also results in the same breaking and balance point which confirms the effective forecast horizons of table 5 another point is about the fpls in fig 8 as it is observed more desirable perspectives about coming inflows led to greater green zone or somehow more probability of future positive effects for example in october where upward trend is superior within the 9 month range ahead the green zone or desirable part of fpl is greater in all reservoirs for more investigation the conventional hedging and the standard operation policy were implemented to the selected system and compared with the proposed tphrc table 6 reports the system performance indices for three models for the entire period of simulation the standard operation policy obtained tsrd as 1350 with about 22 6 reliability of satisfying water demands this index was improved by 10 and 20 respectively for chrc and tphrc as it is clear having a glance into the near future condition made the management more flexible the standard policy systematically maximizes the reliability of the system whereas in the chrc and tphrc similar to other hedging strategies the purpose is to minimize the total squared relative deficit which somehow is related to severity of shortages ashrafi 2021 so the vulnerability and quantitative reliability were improved in both hedging policies this table also visualizes that the effects of coming streamflow were more sensitive into these volume based indices which could be inferred from the second hedging phase embedded in tphrc according to the proposed methodology secondary control was based on the fpls which were dependent on relative deficit so this dependency improved vulnerability more than 5 comparing with chrc fig 10 represents how the applied operating rules including chrc sop and tphrc manage the water deficit over the last 10 years of simulation period in these figures the non white cells show failures the total system deficit of each period was also represented using a color spectrum in non white cells one or more deficit is occurred according to these figures the system has less failure following sop rule than others which could be determined by counting white cells but these failures occurred in higher intensities that originated from the definition of the sop from the other hand hedging policy resulted in more failures with lower intensities which was highlighted in tphrc where glancing into the future condition reduced the number of intensified failures reflected in brighter cells the intensity of deficit is so crucial for some demands like irrigation which is informally about 25 30 for great karun system najl et al 2016 on this basis three rules of chrc sop and tphrc could be deeper compared as illustrated in fig 10 the quantity of total failures of sop is less compared to hedging policies however tphrc outperforms the two others in handling the failures the reason could be investigated on the basis of hedging policy to supply demands as much as possible hedging policy tends to evaluate the demands fluctuation during the entire simulation period and keep the water in the reservoir wherever is needed for a balanced allocation which causes lower intensity also comparing two hedging policies of chrc and tphrc the fact is revealed that the awareness about the streamflow in the near future made the system more flexible to increase or decrease water release over the entire period which somehow prevents intensified deficits 4 conclusion in this study a forecast simulation optimization approach was introduced to drive the optimum rule curves for multi reservoir system the proposed hedging based model was developed defining two independent phases the first step was a conventional hedging policy based on reservoir water level whilst the secondary step benefited from an extra simulation process in the near future using sop to develop a forecast model a hybrid structure was introduced including a feature selection model to identify effective parameters and adaboost rt algorithm to perform learning process in order to determine effective forecast horizon an exterior optimizer was defined in which any random values of forecast horizons were optimized simultaneously with the interior decision variables the configuration of system and demands were mathematically scripted in visual basic using a hierarchical analysis to express how the system components are connected all physical constraints were systematically satisfied in the models used in simulation outside the simulation models of phase one and two an elitism ga was developed to optimize the reservoir rule curves and future performance levels with the objective function of total squared relative deficit also a self adaptive ga was developed for exterior optimizer to minimize total squared relative deficit subjected to a desirable forecast performance of effective horizons the model was implemented for a real six reservoir system located in iran finally the performance of the system was compared with the sop and conventional hedging policy the sop had the best reliability in satisfying water demands in reality the operators can decide to operate the system considering historical time series hoping to repeat in the future generally the basis of rule curve optimization is dependent to this event while the probability of historical events is decreasing due to the effects of climate change and land usage which drastically violates the system performances from desirable values these factors were reflected in nonstationary time series using proposed model it is possible to incorporate future conditions into the real time operation but these future effects are restricted to a certain distance due to the limitation of forecast model in this regard there is a trade off between longer distance with more information and more uncertainty and lower distance with less information and less uncertainty using exterior optimizer it is possible to investigate this trade off systematically to determine effective future distance influencing real time decisions in other words by the proposed model a comprehensive platform is provided to optimally merge future conditions with present states using an extra hedging phase which is based on future performance levels furthermore this future awareness increases the system flexibility resulting in lower intensified deficit comparing with conventional hedging and sop for the forecast model it is observed that the feature selection model identified effective parameters against streamflow for different horizons also adaboost rt algorithm performed well into regression problems especially for shorter horizons different climate conditions are usually concealed into operating rules optimized using historical data as a result these rules are just able to handle similar future conditions in other words long term fundamental changes in the system due to the climate change and human interference caused doubts about the assumption of hydrologic stationarity especially in the design period so a hedging rule policy equipped with a forecast model could have better control on the system performance under the nonstationary streamflow conditions moreover to have successful operation in a multi reservoir system each reservoir manager must observe operational rules carefully to gain this purpose all operators need to be aware how the future conditions could affect their local real time decisions to extend the idea behind this paper it is suggested to introduce a different structure to incorporate future conditions into current states it is also suggested to develop a combinatorial policy according to different climate change scenarios and then interpolate future conditions using a forecast model in addition it should be note that the proposed two phase policy could be applied in a real time operation which use a rolling strategy to make the system more flexible challenging with coming dry and wet conditions formatting of funding sources this research did not receive any

9579,wind drift and evaporation losses wdel which can occur as a result of operational and meteorological factors are two of the most significant sprinkler irrigation losses that can occur even in a well managed irrigation system a proper understanding of factors that influence wdel in sprinkle irrigation is critical for developing water conservation strategies that significantly impact the quality and return on investment of irrigation projects the specific objective of this research was to determine the predictive ability of five soft computing approaches artificial neural network ann adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis multivariate adaptive regression spline mars probabilistic linear regression plr and support vector regression svr for predicting wdel on a sprinkler irrigation system under design operational and meteorological conditions datasets were collected from previously published studies conducted under a variety of conditions the results showed that the five approaches yielded statistically different wdel predictions the ann model produced the most accurate wdel predictions compared to the other models with the training and testing dataset the anfis mars plr and svr models performance ranks were found to be inconsistent across a variety of statistical performance criteria hence shannon s entropy based decision theory was used to rank these models the mars model was ranked second 0 896 followed by the anfis model 0 865 the plr model 0 833 and the svr model 0 794 the design variable auxiliary nozzle diameter and climate variable wind speed both had high contribution ratios 17 5 and 12 19 respectively in wdel modeling to produce a robust predictive model in general the developed models particularly the ann model demonstrated a high degree of accuracy in estimating the wdel of sprinkler irrigation systems keywords sprinkler irrigation artificial neural network adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system multivariate adaptive regression spline probabilistic linear regression support vector regression evaporation and drift losses 1 introduction sprinkler irrigation is a method of applying water that saves up to 50 more water than surface irrigation while maintaining a high level of quality affordability and simplicity of installation li et al 2015 water flowing through the air towards the crop canopy or soil surface is a critical component of sprinkler irrigation efficiency as some water does not reach the irrigated surface this water is ineffectively utilized by the crop and is referred to as wind drift and evaporation losses wdel sadeghi et al 2017 stambouli et al 2013 estimating wdel from sprinklers is extremely important irrigation system design too high is costly too low causes crop water stress water rights allocation very contentious and involves enormous sums of money and the overall requirements for irrigation water management are all influenced by irrigation efficiency and as a result the wdel sarwar et al 2021 sprinkler irrigation efficiency depends on various parameters such as the design variables e g sprinkler type sprinkler nozzle diameter and sprinkler spacing and operating variables e g operating pressure sprinkler height and irrigation time as well as weather conditions carrión et al 2001 playán et al 2006 these parameters are responsible for a portion of the discharge water from the sprinkler nozzle that is wasted and does not reach the crop canopy the amount of wdel published in the literature have been reported to range from 2 and 50 with different operating and sprinkler system types under a wide variety of climates playán et al 2005 2017 sarwar et al 2019 nozzle diameter one of the design aspects plays a crucial role in the water drop diameter in other words a large nozzle diameter leads to large drop diameters that are less affected by wdel keller and bliesner 1990 on the other hand raising the nozzle height above the soil surface produces a higher wdel due to the long drop trajectory and increased exposure to wind in operating factors a rise in operating pressure causes a decrease in drop diameters and increased wdel montero et al 2003 wind speed is another essential meteorological factor that breaks droplet trajectory causing a rise in both the droplet evaporation and wdel dechmi et al 2003 playán et al 2006 zapata et al 2007 sanchez et al 2010 wdel is estimated as the difference between the amount of water discharged by sprinklers and the water gathered using measurement techniques and mathematical methods based on physical principles yan et al 2010 king et al 2012 sadeghi et al 2015 many researchers have documented the use of sprinkle irrigation to analyze the wdel during the water application process e g laboratory and field tests uddin 2012 mohamed et al 2021 molaei et al 2021 due to the fact that various studies have varying degrees of accuracy the results obtained vary significantly as a result estimation of the wdel using these devices during field distribution experiments is imprecise and challenging for testing conducted with water collecting devices the issues connected with water collection equipment e g catch cans and common experimental mistakes in the measuring procedure have encouraged the notion that mathematical models are critical in wdel calculation precise estimation of the wdel is important for water management and the optimal design of sprinkler systems maroufpoor et al 2018 in recent decades several studies such as supharatid 2003 kumar et al 2004 cigizoglu and kisi 2006 chang et al 2010 ismail

parameter estimation is accomplished by multiplying the prior distribution by the likelihood permai and tanty 2018 the svr is a high performance learning system based on constrained optimization theory that uses the notion of structural error minimization induction to provide an optimal solution tang et al 2019 for accuracy more than one model is often utilized in which the outputs of different models are compared for example tabari et al 2010 used ann and multivariate non linear regression approaches to estimate daily pan evaporation in a semi arid region of iran similarly kişi 2006 compared the anfis technique to the ann and stephens stewart methods for estimating daily evaporation several prior studies have also proved the mars approach s potential applicability in other problem issues with reasonable prediction accuracy these include scour depth estimates samadi et al 2015 runoff predictions adamowski et al 2012 sharda et al 2008 downscaling daily precipitations nasseri et al 2013 and potential groundwater mapping zabihi et al 2016 application of plr random forest and cross correlation function to investigate the effectiveness rate of the climatic parameters on the amount of potential evapotranspiration of barley during the growth period was studied by zarei et al 2021 the performance of svr with hybrid nature based algorithms in order to model soil cation exchange capacity was investigated by emamgholizadeh and mohammadi 2021 however due to the time consuming and challenging nature of field measurements mathematical algorithms have been developed to rapidly and accurately estimate the wdel of sprinkler irrigation systems operating under a variety of operating situations to the authors best knowledge no studies have compared the capability of the ann anfis mars plr and svr methods for modeling wdel therefore the aims of the study are to 1 investigate the applicability of three machine learning techniques i e ann anfis and svr and two regression techniques i e mars and plr for modeling wdel from sprinkler irrigation systems 2 assess the effectiveness of the ann anfis mars plr and svr s predictive capabilities to select the best prediction technique and 3 determine which relevant factors influencing wdel using the models contribution analysis 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental datasets table 1 shows the experimental data abo ghobar 1993 dechmi et al 2003 sanchez et al 2010 2011 used to develop the ann anfis mars plr and svr models in total 109 data points were gathered in various locations to determine wdel experiments were conducted utilizing sprinklers with double nozzles in detail these experiments are described as follows the wdel from sprinklers was tested in the first experiment abo ghobar 1993 under various meteorological and operating circumstances combinations during the months of april to july 1991 the experiment was carried out at the educational farm riyadh saudi arabia a total of ten types of impact sprinklers with various nozzle sizes were chosen for field irrigation water was collected in the catch cans after 1 2 h of operation depending on the size of the sprayer s nozzle in the second experiment dechmi et al 2003 the effect of a solid set sprinkler system on maize zea mays l yield was investigated the experiment was carried out from may to august 2000 at the zaragoza experimental farm spain the sizes of the nozzles were 4 4 mm for the main and 2 4 mm for the auxiliary and they were positioned 2 30 m above the soil surface the working pressure of the nozzle was maintained at 300 kpa throughout the season resulting in an 11 meter wetted radius in the third experiment sanchez et al 2010 wdel was determined using data gathered from pluviometers above alfalfa and maize that had been irrigated with sprinkler solid set system under similar operational and technical conditions the experiment was conducted at zaragoza s experimental farm spain in 2006 the main nozzle had a jet straightening vane with a diameter of 4 mm while the auxiliary nozzle had a diameter of 2 4 mm in the fourth experiment sanchez et al 2011 the impact sprinklers performance was investigated with regard to the nozzle diameter pressure and meteorological conditions this study was conducted in the zaragoza experimental farm over the course of two years 2003 and 2004 the main nozzle s diameter was 4 4 mm with a spreader nozzle of 2 4 mm all tests were conducted for two hours with a pressure range of 180 420 kpa and low wind conditions in each experiment with the solid set the amount of water collected in catch cans and pluviometers following each irrigation event is recorded and divided by the number of catch cans to obtain the average irrigation depth id c the wdel is calculated using the sprinkler system s irrigation applied depth idd and the id c christiansen 1942 as 1 wdel i d d i d i d d 2 i d d c d a 2 g p n t s s s l where c d is a coefficient of discharge a

these studies a portion of the applied water is lost to evaporation most notably by a drift away from the irrigated region table 1 summarizes the experimental data used to create the models collected at several sites and under various design operational and weather conditions the data sets which are used as input variables to create the suggested models included design operational and meteorological parameters the design and operating parameters are riser height hr operating pressure p main nozzle diameter dm auxiliary nozzle diameter da and the water discharged by both the main qm and auxiliary qa nozzles wind speed ws air temperature t and relative humidity rh are all examples of meteorological parameters to estimate wdel the ann anfis mars plr and svr models were developed all data 109 data points were randomly divided into 70 for training and 30 for testing it is worth noting that all models use the same training and test data sets to allow for fair performance comparison the training data set must have many values to include all of the problem s characters and ensure accuracy it is important also that the training data set contains all of the problem s maximal and lowest values the statistics parameters for the inputs and outputs used to train and test the proposed models are summarized in table 2 maximum mean minimum standard deviation kurtosis coefficient and skewness coefficient are denoted as xm xa xn sx kx and csx respectively maximum values for design and operating parameters hr p dm da qm qa were highly similar in both training and testing sets as were minimum values for both sets the maximum values of ws and rh were greater than 7 m s 1 and 80 respectively the da had the largest kx and csx magnitudes compared to the other variables 2 2 artificial neural network ann ann has a fundamental ability to identify and comprehend complex and nonlinear relationships through experience swingler 2001 three layers of neurons comprise the ann an input layer independent variables i a hidden layer j and an output layer dependent variables k fig 1 to design the optimal ann structure the number of hidden layers the neurons within each hidden layer the learning algorithm and the activation functions must all be carefully chosen dogan et al 2008 table 3 the most widely used algorithm for training feed forward anns is back propagation thirumalaiah and deo 1998 ciĝizoĝlu 2003 jain and srinivasulu 2004 fernando and shamseldin 2009 nonlinear and complex functions are more accurately modeled by having hidden layers in feed forward networks salehi and razavi 2012 accordingly this study used the back propagation learning algorithm to train the ann with a hidden and an output layer the network input and output are automatically standardized to 0 15 0 85 prior to transferring the data to the ann for training this normalization speeds up the training process and significantly enhances the network s generalization capabilities after normalization the input data are processed unidirectionally from the input layer to the hidden layer and finally to the output layer each neuron information processing unit n in the ann is composed of three components input connection links a central processing unit and output connection linkages weights w are assigned to the connections to store information the strength of the link between two neurons in neighboring layers that is then processed by adding bias threshold value b in the central processing unit izadifar 2010 the activation transfer functions f in the hidden and output neurons processing units are then implemented the hyperbolic tangent tanh function is the most often used transfer function in engineering applications dawson and wilby 1998 zanetti et al 2007 the neural network s tanh transfer functions in the hidden and output layers were applied in the study to train the network the tanh transfer function s general functional form is 3 f x 1 exp 2 x 1 exp 2 x the network s output can be expressed as follows haykin 1999 4 y k f j 1 n j w 2 k j f i 1 n i w 1 j i x i b 1 j b 2 k where y k denotes the output x i is the input parameter with normalized value w 1 j i is the input layer s weight in relation to the hidden layer w 2 k j is the hidden layer s weight in relation to the output layer n i and n j denote the input and output neuron numbers respectively b 1 j and b 2 k denote the biases in the hidden and output layers respectively at the end of each forward pass in the forward propagation step the differences error between the output and target values are determined if the error exceeds the acceptable threshold limit the weights are modified layer by layer back propagation step otherwise the training is terminated the optimal number of hidden neurons is determined using a trial and error approach jain et al 2008 following that the trained ann is tested on the unseen data set 2 3 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis the first step of developing an anfis based model involves constructing an initial fuzzy inference system fis whose parameters are adjusted using a hybrid algorithm to develop the final anfis a fuzzy c mean clustering algorithm fcm bezdek et al 1984 was used to develop the initial fis fcm is a valuable tool in compressing the dataset by dividing them into identical clusters that significantly reduce the number of linear and non linear parameters of fis the number of clusters also determines the number of rules in the developed fis table 3 a sugeno type fis also known as the takagi sugeno kang model introduced in 1985 sugeno 1985 is ideal for creating an initial fis for anfis training sugeno fis s computational framework is based on fuzzy logic theory which integrates fuzzy set theory fuzzy if then rules and fuzzy reasoning the fis s fundamental structure is built of three components i a rule base composed of fuzzy if then rules ii a database that specifies the size type and membership functions mf number utilized in fuzzy rules and iii a reasoning mechanism that performs inference jang et al 1997 using several of these fuzzy if then rules fiss can be employed to map nonlinear input and output spaces a sugeno type fis s input and output membership functions are gaussian and linear respectively a gaussian mf defined by two parameters can be mathematically described as follows jang et al 1997 5 gaussian x c σ e 1 2 x c σ 2 where c represents the center of mf and is the width of mf the present study utilizes a sugeno type fis developed using the fcm algorithm as an initial fis to develop the final anfis the optimal number of clusters was determined by performing multiple trials with various clusters and analyzing the root mean square error rmse of the prediction that resulted the number of clusters that produce minimum rmse and create the least difference in rmse values between the training and testing datasets are chosen as adequate sugeno type anfis was produced by utilizing a hybrid algorithm to tune the parameters of the initial sugeno fis sugeno anfis structures are simpler in architecture than mamdani anfis structures however they have superior learning capabilities compared to other anfis structures jang et al 1997 the fuzzy if then rule set for a sugeno first order fis with two inputs α and β one output γ and two fuzzy if then rules are as follows 6 rule 1 if α is p 1 and β is q 1 then f 1 p 1 α q 1 β r 1 7 rule 2 if α is p 2 and β is q 2 then f 2 p 2 α q 2 β r 2 this is illustrated graphically in fig 2 which depicts a sugeno fuzzy inference system based anfis architecture five layers comprise the proposed sugeno anfis a fuzzy layer a product layer a normalized layer a defuzzification layer and a total output layer 2 4 multivariate adaptive regression spline mars mars is a method for non parametric adaptive regression that enables the construction of flexible regression models friedman 1991 mars divides the total solution space into numerous input variable intervals and constructs a regression model by fitting individual splines or basis functions to each interval bera et al 2006 mars based prediction models were developed to predict wdel with nine predictors the mars uses both the forward and backward stepwise approaches to input output mapping in order to forecast wdel values mars utilizes the backward stepwise technique which eliminates irrelevant input factors in generating the output variable to avoid unnecessary complexity and model overfitting the proposed mars model s input output mapping is as follows roy and datta 2017 bf i x max 0 x j α or 8 max 0 α x j 9 y f x β γ k bf i x where i and j are the indices for basis functions and input variables respectively bf i denotes i th basis functions x j represents j th input variables α is a constant known as knot β is a constant value γ k denotes the corresponding coefficients of bf i x the number of basic functions is chosen in accordance with the number of significant variables required to build a robust mars model table 3 in this study 100 forward steps were permitted during mars model construction mars uses internal heuristics to select the minimal number of observations between knots based on sample size and model complexity in the mars forward stepping methodology no penalty is given to the variables ensuring mars can assign the same importance to all of the variables supplied into the model generation process however throughout the backward stepping process mars selects only the most pertinent input variables required to forecast the output variables model overfitting is minimized with this backward step which makes the constructed model as simple as possible 2 5 probabilistic linear regression plr the plr also known as empirical bayesian linear regression captures the input output mapping for the predicted target variable in plr the regression task is executed via the expectation maximization em algorithm dempster et al 1977 or the mackay fixpoint iteration method mackay 1992 for developing the plr model the present study adopts the em algorithm table 3 the em algorithm is relied on maximizing either the log likelihood or log posterior density functions these functions are integrated with certain latent variables during the optimization process a lower bound f em of the objective function l α is implicitly constructed by the em algorithm such that 10 f em q α e q log p d z p z α q z q z log p d z p z α q z dz where q refers to an arbitrary probability distribution in the space z according to dempster et al 1977 the following are the well known results in the literature of em based on jensen s inequality theorem jensen 1906 lemma 1 f em q α l α in which the equality is attained if and only if q z is the posterior distribution p z d now an alternative optimization problem is defined to be optimized instead of optimizing the original objective function l α this alternate optimization problem is formulated as altoptem find α and a distribution q that maximize f em q α the em algorithm will then act as the coordinate ascent solver for the altoptem more specifically the updating of the rule at the ith iteration of the coordinate ascent can be represented as follows 11 e step q t arg max q f em q α t p z d t 12 m step t 1 arg max f em q t arg max e q t log p z it is noted that by lemma 1 at the end of e step 13 f em q t α t l t this provides rise to the following lemma dempster et al 1977 lemma 2 the iteration of the em algorithm continuously increases the log evidence function l and therefore is guaranteed to converge 2 6 support vector regression svr the svr is a nonparametric modeling approach that is capable of building robust prediction tools this approach relies primarily on kernel functions in developing the prediction models for supervised learning the svr approach uses an asymmetrical loss function the main advantage of employing the svr approach for prediction purposes is that the computational efficiency is not affected by the dimensionality of the input space awad and khanna 2015 the detailed description of svr was presented in vapnik 1995 and gunn 1997 a brief outline of svr is presented in this effort for a regression problem a training dataset can be given as 14 p a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 a 3 b 3 a n b n where a i i 1 2 3 n represents a vector consisting of real independent variables b i i 1 2 3 n is the associated scalar real independent variable for the training dataset the regression equation in the feature space can be represented by 15 z a w w a c where w states the weight vector c indicates a constant a represents the feature function and w a is the dot product svr works by minimizing the following function 16 minimize q f c 1 n l ε b z a w 1 2 w 2 and 17 l ε b z a w 0 if b z a w ε b z a w ε otherwise the left hand side term of eq 16 denotes the empirical error in contrast the term c indicates the degree to which the empirical error is optimized in relation to the model complexity given by the second component of eq 16 eq 17 describes a loss function names ε insensitive loss function vapnik et al 1996 through the incorporation of lagrangian multipliers β and β the optimization problem defined in eq 16 is converted into the dual problem only the non zero coefficients in combination with their input vectors a i are termed as the support vectors the final form of the equation comes out as one presented below 18 z a β i β i i 1 n sv β i β i a i a j c using the kernel function k x i x j the svr function can be written as 19 z a β i β i i 1 n sv β i β i k a a i c the karush kuhn tucker condition is applied to compute the term c in eqs 18 and 19 the cost function c the radius of the insensitive tube ε and the kernel parameters k x i x j are considered as the most important parameters that control regression problems utilizing the svr approach table 3 2 7 entropy weight calculation machine learning based prediction models provide inconsistent prediction performances time and again when different performance evaluation indices are employed in other words for instance the performance of the model improves when wilmott s index of agreement ia is taken into consideration in comparison other models might provide higher performance with respect to the rmse as a result several performance indices should be generated on the test dataset to be used within a decision theory framework to determine the best performing model four benefit indices the higher the better and four cost indices the lower the better were utilized in this study to rank the built prediction models performances shannon s entropy was used to determine the ranking the prediction models and performance evaluation indices were combined to generate a decision matrix for instance if there are m prediction models and l performance evaluation indices the decision matrix can be stated mathematically as wu et al 2011 20 wdel ij wdel 11 wdel 12 wdel 1 l wdel 21 wdel 22 wdel 2 l wdel m 1 wdel m 2 wdel ml the decision matrix was then normalized to minimize the index dimensionality effect the performance indices were normalized to values between 0 and 1such that s ij 0 1 i 1 2 m j 1 2 l the standardized matrix s ij is expressed as wu et al 2011 21 s ij wdel ij max wdel i 1 wdel i 2 wdel il for benefit indexes x ij min wdel i 1 wdel i 2 wdel il for cost indexes the entropy based ranking was used to allocate entropy weights to individual prediction models the ranking procedure was as follows li et al 2011 step1 calculation of the entropy value of each index using shannon s information entropy principles entropy value of the j th index was calculated as 22 entropy j k i 1 m f ij ln f ij where 23 f ij s ij i 1 m s ij 24 k 1 ln m step2 calculation of each index s entropy weight j th index s entropy weight was calculated by 25 w entropy j 1 entropy j l j 1 l entropy j this entropy weight reflects the index s importance in the decision making process the greater the entropy based weight the more information is contained in the index and the more essential the index is in decision making step3 the ranking weight for each model is calculated by multiplying the entropy weight of each index by its standardized value a mathematical representation of this step is 26 w entropy i j 1 l s ij w entropy j step4 determination of model ranking 27 max w entropy i min w entropy i for i 1 2 m step5 calculation of entropy weight for individual prediction models 28 w entropy i w entropy i i 1 m w entropy i 2 8 statistical performance criteria five statistical criteria were used to evaluate the accuracy of the five proposed models ann anfis mars plr and svr these statistical criteria are correlation coefficient r ia kling gupta efficiency kge root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and mean absolute relative error mare following are the equations that determine the statistical criteria 29 r i 1 n wdel i a wdel a wdel i a wdel p i 1 n wdel i a wdel a 2 i 1 n wdel i p wdel p 2 30 ia 1 i 1 n wdel i a wdel i p 2 i 1 n wdel i p wdel a wdel i a wdel a 2

is the standard deviation of predicted wdel values ad is the standard deviation of actual wdel values pm is average of predicted wdel values and am is average of predicted wdel values 3 results and discussion 3 1 development of predication models to determine the optimal ann topology statistical parameters were used to analyze multiple networks with varying numbers of neurons in the hidden layer with the addition of more hidden neurons for the training process the ann architectures significantly improved initially the r rmse and mae values for five neurons in the hidden layer were 0 945 2 962 and 2 457 respectively by increasing the number of hidden neurons from five to six the network performance was improved slightly the r value was enhanced by 1 16 while the rmse and mae values were reduced by 10 13 and 10 58 respectively following that raising the number to six resulted in a degraded performance of the ann thus the optimal ann model included an input layer with nine nodes nine inputs a hidden layer with six neurons and an output layer with a single node wdel the optimal network s r ia kge rmse mae and mare were computed as 0 956 0 978 0 925 2 662 2 197 and 22 29 respectively table 4 fig 3 clearly illustrates that the wdel values followed a straight line during the training process demonstrating that the model s predicted and experimental data were in extremely close agreement the fitted line equation for the ann model indicated that the slope α o and intercept α 1 approached one and zero respectively assuming that the equation is y α o x α 1 to determine the optimal anfis network a hybrid learning approach was used to characterize the link between the input variables and output this strategy combines both the backpropagation and least squares methods to quickly train and adapt the fis to determine the optimal mf distribution to design the optimal anfis network the gaussian mf was employed and assessed experimentally multiple models were developed and their associated parameters were studied to calculate the number of clusters two to five clusters were the most effective range for training and testing once the differences in absolute errors between training and testing processes were minimized the anfis model was chosen the anfis s optimal results are summarized in table 4 for the training process r ia kge rmse mae and mare were calculated as 0 871 0 927 0 817 4 462 3 417 and 32 24 respectively according to fig 3 the values of α o and α 1 for the fitted line equation were 0 758 and 3 853 respectively the mars model was developed using the most significant inputs in the wdel as a result several combinations of related input variables were concurrently assessed to determine the wdel values the predicted wdel was straightforward in which based on the mars model s regression equations mars learns and extracts knowledge from the dataset while generating the regression equations and then presents an explicit relationship between the input and output variables the accuracy of the mars model was determined by its performance with the training and testing datasets during the training phase as shown in table 4 the model s performance was found to be satisfactory with the statistical indices for the training dataset mars yielded r 0 858 ia 0 919 kge 0 799 rmse 4 658 mae 3 387 and mare 34 75 results presented in table 4 show that the training and testing statistics indices were not significantly different this demonstrates that the mars model was not considerably overfitting during training development the scatter plots in fig 3 indicated that the values of α o and α 1 for the fitted line equation are 0 736 and 4 197 respectively table 4 summarizes the plr model s statistical parameters additionally fig 3 depicts the plr model s predicted and observed values the plr model had the lowest r 0 822 ia 0 891 and kge 0 729 and the highest rmse 5 169 mae 4 108 and mare 40 17 during the training process as a result the plr model was the worst for the study s wdel estimation in addition the fit line equation yielded the lowest value of αo 0 599 to improve the accuracy of the wdel prediction of the svr model the parameters of the svr were optimized in the training mode the training r rmse and mae were used to set the ε and the c for the selected kernel function and kernel parameter the svr model s predicted wdel values were found to differ from their observed values the r ia kge rmse mae and mare of the svm results were 0 857 0 914 0 775 4 716 3 505 and 31 39 during the training process table 4 in fig 3 the line s equation represents the observed and expected wdel values the αo and α1 are line s equation parameters with αo being 0 712 and α1 being 3 965 3 2 comparison between prediction models the comparison of the predicted wdel values by the developed ann anfis mars plr and svr models to the observed values using the training and testing datasets is shown in figs 3 and 4 in addition table 4 summarizes the statistical criteria used to evaluate each model during training and testing datasets as shown in fig 3 the α o and α 1 values of the fitted line and the scatter plots visual inspection indicated that the ann model s wdel estimations were closer to the observed values than the other models estimations the α o values for the anfis mars plr and svr models were 15 64 18 05 33 36 and 20 81 respectively lower than those for the ann model the α 1 on the other hand increased by factors of 1 47 1 69 3 36 and 1 54 respectively additionally r ia and kge had the highest ann statistical parameters values whilst rmse mae and mare had the lowest values table 3 modeling the wdel using the developed anfis mars plr and svr resulted in lower r ia and kge values and higher rmse mae and mare values than the ann model during the training dataset these four models anfis mars plr and svr were each able to reduce r ia and kge values by 8 97 10 25 14 and 10 32 5 2 6 04 8 89 and 6 51 and 11 68 13 62 21 19 and 16 22 respectively compared to the results of the ann model additionally the rmse was increased to 67 6 74 94 94 14 and 77 13 respectively using the developed anfis mars plr and svr models similarly the mae was enhanced to 55 55 54 16 86 97 and 59 54 respectively mare was also raised to 44 63 55 91 80 19 and 40 82 respectively in terms of prediction accuracy the anfis model came in second followed by the mars svr and plr models using r ia kge and rmse the r values for the anfis model were around 1 46 5 89 and 1 54 higher than those for the mars plr and svr models respectively other statistical parameters in the anfis model outperformed their values in the mars plr and svr models except for mae in the mars model and mare in the svr model that had the lowest values the plr model had the lowest α o 0 599 and the highest α 1 6 808 values showing that there was significantly less scatter and more clustering around the 1 1 line during the training process fig 3 table 4 demonstrates that the plr model had the lowest r ia and kge and highest rmse mae and mare values showing that the plr model provided slightly inaccurate estimates during the testing phase fig 4 the ann model predicted wdel values that were more tightly clustered around the 1 1 line than the other models mainly due to the ann model s α o 0 821 and α 1 3 992 values which were closer to one and zero respectively compared to the other prediction models values for anfis mars plr and svr models the α o values varied between 0 599 and 0 748 whereas the α 1 values ranged between 4 008 and 6 808 the ann model s results for performance statistics provided the best overall results table 4 having the highest r 0 861 ia 0 925 and kge 0 85 values in contrast the rmse 4 356 mae 3 49 and mare 24 15 were the lowest clearly the r ia and kge values for the mars model decreased by 5 63 3 05 and 6 69 respectively compared to the ann model rmse mae and mare values on the other hand increased by 14 79 14 82 and 6 69 respectively the anfis model came in the third rank with slightly higher r ia and kge values of 0 81 0 05 and 0 07 respectively compared to the plr model on the other hand the anfis model had a lower rmse value of 0 38 than the plr models in accordance with mae and mare the plr model had better performance than the anfis model the r ai and kge values for the svm model were the lowest while the rmse and mae values were the highest the whisker boxplots in fig 5 show the absolute error distribution associated with the projected values for the developed models the range of predicted error values was demarcated by quartiles of the absolute errors of prediction the lower quartile 25th percentile represents the boxplot s lower bound while the upper quartile represents the boxplot s top bound 75th percentile the horizontal line within each box shows the median of the prediction model s absolute errors the symbols indicate the average value of the absolute errors the lower whisker extends from the box bottom to the lowest non outlier in the absolute error dataset while the upper whisker extends from the box top to the largest non outlier from fig 5 it appears that the ann model had the smallest extent of errors while the svr model had the largest ones as a result the ann model performed better than the other models with the fewest mean and median absolute errors additionally the ann model had the smallest lower quartile value followed by the mars model anfis s upper quartile value was ranked third following the ann and mars models the svr model generated the maximum mean value of absolute errors whereas the plr produced the maximum median value of absolute errors the models performances were found to be inconsistent across a variety of performance metrics as a result selecting the optimal model was difficult to use these criteria therefore the shannon s entropy based decision theory method which is widely utilized zou et al 2006 liu et al 2010 was used to rank the models for wdel predicting table 5 the major advantage of this method is the avoidance of human influences interfering with indicator weighting which improves the objectivity of the outcomes of the overall assessment taheriyoun et al 2010 ding et al 2017 as a result the method has become increasingly popular in recent years as a decision making tool wu et al 2015 yan et al 2016 feng et al 2019 the predicted outcomes were prioritized according to the weight assignments that were applied to the processes to manage the contradictory performances across the performance criteria this method revealed that the ann model with the highest weight 0 999 was the best performing followed by mars anfis and so on the svr on the other hand was found to be the least ranked model 3 3 contribution analysis due to the superior predictive ability of the ann model ann was utilized to study the contribution of the inputs i e hr p da dm qa qm ws rh and t that were utilized to model the wdel the connection weights acquired from the ann architecture were used to generate the contribution ratios for each input training as a result of this technique it was possible to determine which inputs were most effective at generating the model s output predictions fig 6 illustrates wdel prediction s contribution ratio values for each input variable as illustrated in this figure da 17 5 and hr 16 3 were the most influential factors while qm and ws came in third and fourth with a contribution ratio of 12 57 and 12 19 respectively the t rh and p had a moderate effect with their contribution ratio values of 9 96 9 02 and 8 99 respectively according to playán et al 2005 al ghobari et al 2018 and sarwar et al 2019 t and rh are contributing variables in wdel under a variety of technical and operational conditions molle et al 2012 demonstrate that droplet evaporation is t and rh dependent with evaporation occurring as a result of the difference between the actual and saturation water vapor pressures at a certain ambient air temperature i e vapor pressure deficit when the surrounding air has a high rh the droplets evaporate more slowly due to the low vapor pressure deficit resulting in inadequate energy to convert the droplet s sensible heat to latent heat 4 conclusion wind drift and evaporation losses wdel are the wide range of sprinkler water application losses that are the most important factors required for irrigation system management and design the artificial neural network ann the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis the multivariate adaptive regression spline mars the probabilistic linear regression plr and the support vector regression svr were used to develop models that could predict of wdel using design operational and meteorological variables in sprinkler irrigation these models were trained and tested using datasets from climates and sprinklers published by other researchers according to the statistical evaluation criteria and shannon s entropy based decision theory the ann model outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy the svr model produced high error implying that the prediction values were less accurate in addition the mars model ranked second followed by anfis and plr models the auxiliary nozzle diameter of sprinkler and wind speed were dominating design and climate variables producing a robust predictive model incorporating the air temperature and relative humidity into the modeling process via the vapor pressure deficit is desirable in brief ann was a reliable and powerful prediction tool for modeling wdel in the sprinkler irrigation system using the developed ann model irrigation system managers could adjust various field operations to maximize

9579,wind drift and evaporation losses wdel which can occur as a result of operational and meteorological factors are two of the most significant sprinkler irrigation losses that can occur even in a well managed irrigation system a proper understanding of factors that influence wdel in sprinkle irrigation is critical for developing water conservation strategies that significantly impact the quality and return on investment of irrigation projects the specific objective of this research was to determine the predictive ability of five soft computing approaches artificial neural network ann adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis multivariate adaptive regression spline mars probabilistic linear regression plr and support vector regression svr for predicting wdel on a sprinkler irrigation system under design operational and meteorological conditions datasets were collected from previously published studies conducted under a variety of conditions the results showed that the five approaches yielded statistically different wdel predictions the ann model produced the most accurate wdel predictions compared to the other models with the training and testing dataset the anfis mars plr and svr models performance ranks were found to be inconsistent across a variety of statistical performance criteria hence shannon s entropy based decision theory was used to rank these models the mars model was ranked second 0 896 followed by the anfis model 0 865 the plr model 0 833 and the svr model 0 794 the design variable auxiliary nozzle diameter and climate variable wind speed both had high contribution ratios 17 5 and 12 19 respectively in wdel modeling to produce a robust predictive model in general the developed models particularly the ann model demonstrated a high degree of accuracy in estimating the wdel of sprinkler irrigation systems keywords sprinkler irrigation artificial neural network adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system multivariate adaptive regression spline probabilistic linear regression support vector regression evaporation and drift losses 1 introduction sprinkler irrigation is a method of applying water that saves up to 50 more water than surface irrigation while maintaining a high level of quality affordability and simplicity of installation li et al 2015 water flowing through the air towards the crop canopy or soil surface is a critical component of sprinkler irrigation efficiency as some water does not reach the irrigated surface this water is ineffectively utilized by the crop and is referred to as wind drift and evaporation losses wdel sadeghi et al 2017 stambouli et al 2013 estimating wdel from sprinklers is extremely important irrigation system design too high is costly too low causes crop water stress water rights allocation very contentious and involves enormous sums of money and the overall requirements for irrigation water management are all influenced by irrigation efficiency and as a result the wdel sarwar et al 2021 sprinkler irrigation efficiency depends on various parameters such as the design variables e g sprinkler type sprinkler nozzle diameter and sprinkler spacing and operating variables e g operating pressure sprinkler height and irrigation time as well as weather conditions carrión et al 2001 playán et al 2006 these parameters are responsible for a portion of the discharge water from the sprinkler nozzle that is wasted and does not reach the crop canopy the amount of wdel published in the literature have been reported to range from 2 and 50 with different operating and sprinkler system types under a wide variety of climates playán et al 2005 2017 sarwar et al 2019 nozzle diameter one of the design aspects plays a crucial role in the water drop diameter in other words a large nozzle diameter leads to large drop diameters that are less affected by wdel keller and bliesner 1990 on the other hand raising the nozzle height above the soil surface produces a higher wdel due to the long drop trajectory and increased exposure to wind in operating factors a rise in operating pressure causes a decrease in drop diameters and increased wdel montero et al 2003 wind speed is another essential meteorological factor that breaks droplet trajectory causing a rise in both the droplet evaporation and wdel dechmi et al 2003 playán et al 2006 zapata et al 2007 sanchez et al 2010 wdel is estimated as the difference between the amount of water discharged by sprinklers and the water gathered using measurement techniques and mathematical methods based on physical principles yan et al 2010 king et al 2012 sadeghi et al 2015 many researchers have documented the use of sprinkle irrigation to analyze the wdel during the water application process e g laboratory and field tests uddin 2012 mohamed et al 2021 molaei et al 2021 due to the fact that various studies have varying degrees of accuracy the results obtained vary significantly as a result estimation of the wdel using these devices during field distribution experiments is imprecise and challenging for testing conducted with water collecting devices the issues connected with water collection equipment e g catch cans and common experimental mistakes in the measuring procedure have encouraged the notion that mathematical models are critical in wdel calculation precise estimation of the wdel is important for water management and the optimal design of sprinkler systems maroufpoor et al 2018 in recent decades several studies such as supharatid 2003 kumar et al 2004 cigizoglu and kisi 2006 chang et al 2010 ismail et al 2012 kalra et al 2013 yassin et al 2016 petković et al 2017 mattar 2018 mattar et al 2020 kuzman et al 2021 lakovic et al 2021 and roy et al 2021 reported on successful applications of artificial intelligence techniques in a variety field of water engineering irrigation and agricultural topics artificial neural networks ann adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis multivariate adaptive regression spline mars probabilistic linear regression plr and support vector regression svr are in use because of their ability to handle nonlinear problems high processing speed advanced parallelism self learning and generalization capabilities basheer and hajmeer 2000 these artificial techniques are centered on computational intelligence and machine learning technologies that utilize mathematics and statistics to correlate the system s input parameters to the system s outputs hamdia et al 2015 for instance ann is able to learn from examples recognize data patterns and process information quickly whereas anfis presents a neural networking combination and a fuzzy system dealing with higher level thinking consequently these techniques may provide a feasible alternative to empirical or physically based analytical formulas with a high number of variables hamdia et al 2015 mars is a method for modeling high dimensional data in a flexible way mars does not prescribe a certain type of link between the response and predictor variables instead it expands in product spline functions with the number of spline functions and interactions chosen dynamically by the data friedman 1991 friedman and roosen 1995 mars is a semiparametric technique that frequently bridges the gap between parametric and nonparametric approaches huang et al 2019 plr is a type of regression modeling that employs a bayesian technique for parameter estimation there are three distributions in the bayesian approach a prior a likelihood distribution and a posterior distribution bayesian parameter estimation is accomplished by multiplying the prior distribution by the likelihood permai and tanty 2018 the svr is a high performance learning system based on constrained optimization theory that uses the notion of structural error minimization induction to provide an optimal solution tang et al 2019 for accuracy more than one model is often utilized in which the outputs of different models are compared for example tabari et al 2010 used ann and multivariate non linear regression approaches to estimate daily pan evaporation in a semi arid region of iran similarly kişi 2006 compared the anfis technique to the ann and stephens stewart methods for estimating daily evaporation several prior studies have also proved the mars approach s potential applicability in other problem issues with reasonable prediction accuracy these include scour depth estimates samadi et al 2015 runoff predictions adamowski et al 2012 sharda et al 2008 downscaling daily precipitations nasseri et al 2013 and potential groundwater mapping zabihi et al 2016 application of plr random forest and cross correlation function to investigate the effectiveness rate of the climatic parameters on the amount of potential evapotranspiration of barley during the growth period was studied by zarei et al 2021 the performance of svr with hybrid nature based algorithms in order to model soil cation exchange capacity was investigated by emamgholizadeh and mohammadi 2021 however due to the time consuming and challenging nature of field measurements mathematical algorithms have been developed to rapidly and accurately estimate the wdel of sprinkler irrigation systems operating under a variety of operating situations to the authors best knowledge no studies have compared the capability of the ann anfis mars plr and svr methods for modeling wdel therefore the aims of the study are to 1 investigate the applicability of three machine learning techniques i e ann anfis and svr and two regression techniques i e mars and plr for modeling wdel from sprinkler irrigation systems 2 assess the effectiveness of the ann anfis mars plr and svr s predictive capabilities to select the best prediction technique and 3 determine which relevant factors influencing wdel using the models contribution analysis 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental datasets table 1 shows the experimental data abo ghobar 1993 dechmi et al 2003 sanchez et al 2010 2011 used to develop the ann anfis mars plr and svr models in total 109 data points were gathered in various locations to determine wdel experiments were conducted utilizing sprinklers with double nozzles in detail these experiments are described as follows the wdel from sprinklers was tested in the first experiment abo ghobar 1993 under various meteorological and operating circumstances combinations during the months of april to july 1991 the experiment was carried out at the educational farm riyadh saudi arabia a total of ten types of impact sprinklers with various nozzle sizes were chosen for field irrigation water was collected in the catch cans after 1 2 h of operation depending on the size of the sprayer s nozzle in the second experiment dechmi et al 2003 the effect of a solid set sprinkler system on maize zea mays l yield was investigated the experiment was carried out from may to august 2000 at the zaragoza experimental farm spain the sizes of the nozzles were 4 4 mm for the main and 2 4 mm for the auxiliary and they were positioned 2 30 m above the soil surface the working pressure of the nozzle was maintained at 300 kpa throughout the season resulting in an 11 meter wetted radius in the third experiment sanchez et al 2010 wdel was determined using data gathered from pluviometers above alfalfa and maize that had been irrigated with sprinkler solid set system under similar operational and technical conditions the experiment was conducted at zaragoza s experimental farm spain in 2006 the main nozzle had a jet straightening vane with a diameter of 4 mm while the auxiliary nozzle had a diameter of 2 4 mm in the fourth experiment sanchez et al 2011 the impact sprinklers performance was investigated with regard to the nozzle diameter pressure and meteorological conditions this study was conducted in the zaragoza experimental farm over the course of two years 2003 and 2004 the main nozzle s diameter was 4 4 mm with a spreader nozzle of 2 4 mm all tests were conducted for two hours with a pressure range of 180 420 kpa and low wind conditions in each experiment with the solid set the amount of water collected in catch cans and pluviometers following each irrigation event is recorded and divided by the number of catch cans to obtain the average irrigation depth id c the wdel is calculated using the sprinkler system s irrigation applied depth idd and the id c christiansen 1942 as 1 wdel i d d i d i d d 2 i d d c d a 2 g p n t s s s l where c d is a coefficient of discharge a is the orifice area of the nozzle g is acceleration of gravity n is the exponent of discharge t is the running time and both s s and s l are the sprinkler s allocated area according to the findings of these studies a portion of the applied water is lost to evaporation most notably by a drift away from the irrigated region table 1 summarizes the experimental data used to create the models collected at several sites and under various design operational and weather conditions the data sets which are used as input variables to create the suggested models included design operational and meteorological parameters the design and operating parameters are riser height hr operating pressure p main nozzle diameter dm auxiliary nozzle diameter da and the water discharged by both the main qm and auxiliary qa nozzles wind speed ws air temperature t and relative humidity rh are all examples of meteorological parameters to estimate wdel the ann anfis mars plr and svr models were developed all data 109 data points were randomly divided into 70 for training and 30 for testing it is worth noting that all models use the same training and test data sets to allow for fair performance comparison the training data set must have many values to include all of the problem s characters and ensure accuracy it is important also that the training data set contains all of the problem s maximal and lowest values the statistics parameters for the inputs and outputs used to train and test the proposed models are summarized in table 2 maximum mean minimum standard deviation kurtosis coefficient and skewness coefficient are denoted as xm xa xn sx kx and csx respectively maximum values for design and operating parameters hr p dm da qm qa were highly similar in both training and testing sets as were minimum values for both sets the maximum values of ws and rh were greater than 7 m s 1 and 80 respectively the da had the largest kx and csx magnitudes compared to the other variables 2 2 artificial neural network ann ann has a fundamental ability to identify and comprehend complex and nonlinear relationships through experience swingler 2001 three layers of neurons comprise the ann an input layer independent variables i a hidden layer j and an output layer dependent variables k fig 1 to design the optimal ann structure the number of hidden layers the neurons within each hidden layer the learning algorithm and the activation functions must all be carefully chosen dogan et al 2008 table 3 the most widely used algorithm for training feed forward anns is back propagation thirumalaiah and deo 1998 ciĝizoĝlu 2003 jain and srinivasulu 2004 fernando and shamseldin 2009 nonlinear and complex functions are more accurately modeled by having hidden layers in feed forward networks salehi and razavi 2012 accordingly this study used the back propagation learning algorithm to train the ann with a hidden and an output layer the network input and output are automatically standardized to 0 15 0 85 prior to transferring the data to the ann for training this normalization speeds up the training process and significantly enhances the network s generalization capabilities after normalization the input data are processed unidirectionally from the input layer to the hidden layer and finally to the output layer each neuron information processing unit n in the ann is composed of three components input connection links a central processing unit and output connection linkages weights w are assigned to the connections to store information the strength of the link between two neurons in neighboring layers that is then processed by adding bias threshold value b in the central processing unit izadifar 2010 the activation transfer functions f in the hidden and output neurons processing units are then implemented the hyperbolic tangent tanh function is the most often used transfer function in engineering applications dawson and wilby 1998 zanetti et al 2007 the neural network s tanh transfer functions in the hidden and output layers were applied in the study to train the network the tanh transfer function s general functional form is 3 f x 1 exp 2 x 1 exp 2 x the network s output can be expressed as follows haykin 1999 4 y k f j 1 n j w 2 k j f i 1 n i w 1 j i x i b 1 j b 2 k where y k denotes the output x i is the input parameter with normalized value w 1 j i is the input layer s weight in relation to the hidden layer w 2 k j is the hidden layer s weight in relation to the output layer n i and n j denote the input and output neuron numbers respectively b 1 j and b 2 k denote the biases in the hidden and output layers respectively at the end of each forward pass in the forward propagation step the differences error between the output and target values are determined if the error exceeds the acceptable threshold limit the weights are modified layer by layer back propagation step otherwise the training is terminated the optimal number of hidden neurons is determined using a trial and error approach jain et al 2008 following that the trained ann is tested on the unseen data set 2 3 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis the first step of developing an anfis based model involves constructing an initial fuzzy inference system fis whose parameters are adjusted using a hybrid algorithm to develop the final anfis a fuzzy c mean clustering algorithm fcm bezdek et al 1984 was used to develop the initial fis fcm is a valuable tool in compressing the dataset by dividing them into identical clusters that significantly reduce the number of linear and non linear parameters of fis the number of clusters also determines the number of rules in the developed fis table 3 a sugeno type fis also known as the takagi sugeno kang model introduced in 1985 sugeno 1985 is ideal for creating an initial fis for anfis training sugeno fis s computational framework is based on fuzzy logic theory which integrates fuzzy set theory fuzzy if then rules and fuzzy reasoning the fis s fundamental structure is built of three components i a rule base composed of fuzzy if then rules ii a database that specifies the size type and membership functions mf number utilized in fuzzy rules and iii a reasoning mechanism that performs inference jang et al 1997 using several of these fuzzy if then rules fiss can be employed to map nonlinear input and output spaces a sugeno type fis s input and output membership functions are gaussian and linear respectively a gaussian mf defined by two parameters can be mathematically described as follows jang et al 1997 5 gaussian x c σ e 1 2 x c σ 2 where c represents the center of mf and is the width of mf the present study utilizes a sugeno type fis developed using the fcm algorithm as an initial fis to develop the final anfis the optimal number of clusters was determined by performing multiple trials with various clusters and analyzing the root mean square error rmse of the prediction that resulted the number of clusters that produce minimum rmse and create the least difference in rmse values between the training and testing datasets are chosen as adequate sugeno type anfis was produced by utilizing a hybrid algorithm to tune the parameters of the initial sugeno fis sugeno anfis structures are simpler in architecture than mamdani anfis structures however they have superior learning capabilities compared to other anfis structures jang et al 1997 the fuzzy if then rule set for a sugeno first order fis with two inputs α and β one output γ and two fuzzy if then rules are as follows 6 rule 1 if α is p 1 and β is q 1 then f 1 p 1 α q 1 β r 1 7 rule 2 if α is p 2 and β is q 2 then f 2 p 2 α q 2 β r 2 this is illustrated graphically in fig 2 which depicts a sugeno fuzzy inference system based anfis architecture five layers comprise the proposed sugeno anfis a fuzzy layer a product layer a normalized layer a defuzzification layer and a total output layer 2 4 multivariate adaptive regression spline mars mars is a method for non parametric adaptive regression that enables the construction of flexible regression models friedman 1991 mars divides the total solution space into numerous input variable intervals and constructs a regression model by fitting individual splines or basis functions to each interval bera et al 2006 mars based prediction models were developed to predict wdel with nine predictors the mars uses both the forward and backward stepwise approaches to input output mapping in order to forecast wdel values mars utilizes the backward stepwise technique which eliminates irrelevant input factors in generating the output variable to avoid unnecessary complexity and model overfitting the proposed mars model s input output mapping is as follows roy and datta 2017 bf i x max 0 x j α or 8 max 0 α x j 9 y f x β γ k bf i x where i and j are the indices for basis functions and input variables respectively bf i denotes i th basis functions x j represents j th input variables α is a constant known as knot β is a constant value γ k denotes the corresponding coefficients of bf i x the number of basic functions is chosen in accordance with the number of significant variables required to build a robust mars model table 3 in this study 100 forward steps were permitted during mars model construction mars uses internal heuristics to select the minimal number of observations between knots based on sample size and model complexity in the mars forward stepping methodology no penalty is given to the variables ensuring mars can assign the same importance to all of the variables supplied into the model generation process however throughout the backward stepping process mars selects only the most pertinent input variables required to forecast the output variables model overfitting is minimized with this backward step which makes the constructed model as simple as possible 2 5 probabilistic linear regression plr the plr also known as empirical bayesian linear regression captures the input output mapping for the predicted target variable in plr the regression task is executed via the expectation maximization em algorithm dempster et al 1977 or the mackay fixpoint iteration method mackay 1992 for developing the plr model the present study adopts the em algorithm table 3 the em algorithm is relied on maximizing either the log likelihood or log posterior density functions these functions are integrated with certain latent variables during the optimization process a lower bound f em of the objective function l α is implicitly constructed by the em algorithm such that 10 f em q α e q log p d z p z α q z q z log p d z p z α q z dz where q refers to an arbitrary probability distribution in the space z according to dempster et al 1977 the following are the well known results in the literature of em based on jensen s inequality theorem jensen 1906 lemma 1 f em q α l α in which the equality is attained if and only if q z is the posterior distribution p z d now an alternative optimization problem is defined to be optimized instead of optimizing the original objective function l α this alternate optimization problem is formulated as altoptem find α and a distribution q that maximize f em q α the em algorithm will then act as the coordinate ascent solver for the altoptem more specifically the updating of the rule at the ith iteration of the coordinate ascent can be represented as follows 11 e step q t arg max q f em q α t p z d t 12 m step t 1 arg max f em q t arg max e q t log p z it is noted that by lemma 1 at the end of e step 13 f em q t α t l t this provides rise to the following lemma dempster et al 1977 lemma 2 the iteration of the em algorithm continuously increases the log evidence function l and therefore is guaranteed to converge 2 6 support vector regression svr the svr is a nonparametric modeling approach that is capable of building robust prediction tools this approach relies primarily on kernel functions in developing the prediction models for supervised learning the svr approach uses an asymmetrical loss function the main advantage of employing the svr approach for prediction purposes is that the computational efficiency is not affected by the dimensionality of the input space awad and khanna 2015 the detailed description of svr was presented in vapnik 1995 and gunn 1997 a brief outline of svr is presented in this effort for a regression problem a training dataset can be given as 14 p a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 a 3 b 3 a n b n where a i i 1 2 3 n represents a vector consisting of real independent variables b i i 1 2 3 n is the associated scalar real independent variable for the training dataset the regression equation in the feature space can be represented by 15 z a w w a c where w states the weight vector c indicates a constant a represents the feature function and w a is the dot product svr works by minimizing the following function 16 minimize q f c 1 n l ε b z a w 1 2 w 2 and 17 l ε b z a w 0 if b z a w ε b z a w ε otherwise the left hand side term of eq 16 denotes the empirical error in contrast the term c indicates the degree to which the empirical error is optimized in relation to the model complexity given by the second component of eq 16 eq 17 describes a loss function names ε insensitive loss function vapnik et al 1996 through the incorporation of lagrangian multipliers β and β the optimization problem defined in eq 16 is converted into the dual problem only the non zero coefficients in combination with their input vectors a i are termed as the support vectors the final form of the equation comes out as one presented below 18 z a β i β i i 1 n sv β i β i a i a j c using the kernel function k x i x j the svr function can be written as 19 z a β i β i i 1 n sv β i β i k a a i c the karush kuhn tucker condition is applied to compute the term c in eqs 18 and 19 the cost function c the radius of the insensitive tube ε and the kernel parameters k x i x j are considered as the most important parameters that control regression problems utilizing the svr approach table 3 2 7 entropy weight calculation machine learning based prediction models provide inconsistent prediction performances time and again when different performance evaluation indices are employed in other words for instance the performance of the model improves when wilmott s index of agreement ia is taken into consideration in comparison other models might provide higher performance with respect to the rmse as a result several performance indices should be generated on the test dataset to be used within a decision theory framework to determine the best performing model four benefit indices the higher the better and four cost indices the lower the better were utilized in this study to rank the built prediction models performances shannon s entropy was used to determine the ranking the prediction models and performance evaluation indices were combined to generate a decision matrix for instance if there are m prediction models and l performance evaluation indices the decision matrix can be stated mathematically as wu et al 2011 20 wdel ij wdel 11 wdel 12 wdel 1 l wdel 21 wdel 22 wdel 2 l wdel m 1 wdel m 2 wdel ml the decision matrix was then normalized to minimize the index dimensionality effect the performance indices were normalized to values between 0 and 1such that s ij 0 1 i 1 2 m j 1 2 l the standardized matrix s ij is expressed as wu et al 2011 21 s ij wdel ij max wdel i 1 wdel i 2 wdel il for benefit indexes x ij min wdel i 1 wdel i 2 wdel il for cost indexes the entropy based ranking was used to allocate entropy weights to individual prediction models the ranking procedure was as follows li et al 2011 step1 calculation of the entropy value of each index using shannon s information entropy principles entropy value of the j th index was calculated as 22 entropy j k i 1 m f ij ln f ij where 23 f ij s ij i 1 m s ij 24 k 1 ln m step2 calculation of each index s entropy weight j th index s entropy weight was calculated by 25 w entropy j 1 entropy j l j 1 l entropy j this entropy weight reflects the index s importance in the decision making process the greater the entropy based weight the more information is contained in the index and the more essential the index is in decision making step3 the ranking weight for each model is calculated by multiplying the entropy weight of each index by its standardized value a mathematical representation of this step is 26 w

discussion 3 1 development of predication models to determine the optimal ann topology statistical parameters were used to analyze multiple networks with varying numbers of neurons in the hidden layer with the addition of more hidden neurons for the training process the ann architectures significantly improved initially the r rmse and mae values for five neurons in the hidden layer were 0 945 2 962 and 2 457 respectively by increasing the number of hidden neurons from five to six the network performance was improved slightly the r value was enhanced by 1 16 while the rmse and mae values were reduced by 10 13 and 10 58 respectively following that raising the number to six resulted in a degraded performance of the ann thus the optimal ann model included an input layer with nine nodes nine inputs a hidden layer with six neurons and an output layer with a single node wdel the optimal network s r ia kge rmse mae and mare were computed as 0 956 0 978 0 925 2 662 2 197 and 22 29 respectively table 4 fig 3 clearly illustrates that the wdel values followed a straight line during the training process demonstrating that the model s predicted and experimental data were in extremely close agreement the fitted line equation for the ann model indicated that the slope α o and intercept α 1 approached one and zero respectively assuming that the equation is y α o x α 1 to determine the optimal anfis network a hybrid learning approach was used to characterize the link between the input variables and output this strategy combines both the backpropagation and least squares methods to quickly train and adapt the fis to determine the optimal mf distribution to design the optimal anfis network the gaussian mf was employed and assessed experimentally multiple models were developed and their associated parameters were studied to calculate the number of clusters two to five clusters were the most effective range for training and testing once the differences in absolute errors between training and testing processes were minimized the anfis model was chosen the anfis s optimal results are summarized in table 4 for the training process r ia kge rmse mae and mare were calculated as 0 871 0 927 0 817 4 462 3 417 and 32 24 respectively according to fig 3 the values of α o and α 1 for the fitted line equation were 0 758 and 3 853 respectively the mars model was developed using the most significant inputs in the wdel as a result several combinations of related input variables were concurrently assessed to determine the wdel values the predicted wdel was straightforward in which based on the mars model s regression equations mars learns and extracts knowledge from the dataset while generating the regression equations and then presents an explicit relationship between the input and output variables the accuracy of the mars model was determined by its performance with the training and testing datasets during the training phase as shown in table 4 the model s performance was found to be satisfactory with the statistical indices for the training dataset mars yielded r 0 858 ia 0 919 kge 0 799 rmse 4 658 mae 3 387 and mare 34 75 results presented in table 4 show that the training and testing statistics indices were not significantly different this demonstrates that the mars model was not considerably overfitting during training development the scatter plots in fig 3 indicated that the values of α o and α 1 for the fitted line equation are 0 736 and 4 197 respectively table 4 summarizes the plr model s statistical parameters additionally fig 3 depicts the plr model s predicted and observed values the plr model had the lowest r 0 822 ia 0 891 and kge 0 729 and the highest rmse 5 169 mae 4 108 and mare 40 17 during the training process as a result the plr model was the worst for the study s wdel estimation in addition the fit line equation yielded the lowest value of αo 0 599 to improve the accuracy of the wdel prediction of the svr model the parameters of the svr were optimized in the training mode the training r rmse and mae were used to set the ε and the c for the selected kernel function and kernel parameter the svr model s predicted wdel values were found to differ from their observed values the r ia kge rmse mae and mare of the svm results were 0 857 0 914 0 775 4 716 3 505 and 31 39 during the training process table 4 in fig 3 the line s equation represents the observed and expected wdel values the αo and α1 are line s equation parameters with αo being 0 712 and α1 being 3 965 3 2 comparison between prediction models the comparison of the predicted wdel values by the developed ann anfis mars plr and svr models to the observed values using the training and testing datasets is shown in figs 3 and 4 in addition table 4 summarizes the statistical criteria used to evaluate each model during training and testing datasets as shown in fig 3 the α o and α 1 values of the fitted line and the scatter plots visual inspection indicated that the ann model s wdel estimations were closer to the observed values than the other models estimations the α o values for the anfis mars plr and svr models were 15 64 18 05 33 36 and 20 81 respectively lower than those for the ann model the α 1 on the other hand increased by factors of 1 47 1 69 3 36 and 1 54 respectively additionally r ia and kge had the highest ann statistical parameters values whilst rmse mae and mare had the lowest values table 3 modeling the wdel using the developed anfis mars plr and svr resulted in lower r ia and kge values and higher rmse mae and mare values than the ann model during the training dataset these four models anfis mars plr and svr were each able to reduce r ia and kge values by 8 97 10 25 14 and 10 32 5 2 6 04 8 89 and 6 51 and 11 68 13 62 21 19 and 16 22 respectively compared to the results of the ann model additionally the rmse was increased to 67 6 74 94 94 14 and 77 13 respectively using the developed anfis mars plr and svr models similarly the mae was enhanced to 55 55 54 16 86 97 and 59 54 respectively mare was also raised to 44 63 55 91 80 19 and 40 82 respectively in terms of prediction accuracy the anfis model came in second followed by the mars svr and plr models using r ia kge and rmse the r values for the anfis model were around 1 46 5 89 and 1 54 higher than those for the mars plr and svr models respectively other statistical parameters in the anfis model outperformed their values in the mars plr and svr models except for mae in the mars model and mare in the svr model that had the lowest values the plr model had the lowest α o 0 599 and the highest α 1 6 808 values showing that there was significantly less scatter and more clustering around the 1 1 line during the training process fig 3 table 4 demonstrates that the plr model had the lowest r ia and kge and highest rmse mae and mare values showing that the plr model provided slightly inaccurate estimates during the testing phase fig 4 the ann model predicted wdel values that were more tightly clustered around the 1 1 line than the other models mainly due to the ann model s α o 0 821 and α 1 3 992 values which were closer to one and zero respectively compared to the other prediction models values for anfis mars plr and svr models the α o values varied between 0 599 and 0 748 whereas the α 1 values ranged between 4 008 and 6 808 the ann model s results for performance statistics provided the best overall results table 4 having the highest r 0 861 ia 0 925 and kge 0 85 values in contrast the rmse 4 356 mae 3 49 and mare 24 15 were the lowest clearly the r ia and kge values for the mars model decreased by 5 63 3 05 and 6 69 respectively compared to the ann model rmse mae and mare values on the other hand increased by 14 79 14 82 and 6 69 respectively the anfis model came in the third rank with slightly higher r ia and kge values of 0 81 0 05 and 0 07 respectively compared to the plr model on the other hand the anfis model had a lower rmse value of 0 38 than the plr models in accordance with mae and mare the plr model had better performance than the anfis model the r ai and kge values for the svm model were the lowest while the rmse and mae values were the highest the whisker boxplots in fig 5 show the absolute error distribution associated with the projected values for the developed models the range of predicted error values was demarcated by quartiles of the absolute errors of prediction the lower quartile 25th percentile represents the boxplot s lower bound while the upper quartile represents the boxplot s top bound 75th percentile the horizontal line within each box shows the median of the prediction model s absolute errors the symbols indicate the average value of the absolute errors the lower whisker extends from the box bottom to the lowest non outlier in the absolute error dataset while the upper whisker extends from the box top to the largest non outlier from fig 5 it appears that the ann model had the smallest extent of errors while the svr model had the largest ones as a result the ann model performed better than the other models with the fewest mean and median absolute errors additionally the ann model had the smallest lower quartile value followed by the mars model anfis s upper quartile value was ranked third following the ann and mars models the svr model generated the maximum mean value of absolute errors whereas the plr produced the maximum median value of absolute errors the models performances were found to be inconsistent across a variety of performance metrics as a result selecting the optimal model was difficult to use these criteria therefore the shannon s entropy based decision theory method which is widely utilized zou et al 2006 liu et al 2010 was used to rank the models for wdel predicting table 5 the major advantage of this method is the avoidance of human influences interfering with indicator weighting which improves the objectivity of the outcomes of the overall assessment taheriyoun et al 2010 ding et al 2017 as a result the method has become increasingly popular in recent years as a decision making tool wu et al 2015 yan et al 2016 feng et al 2019 the predicted outcomes were prioritized according to the weight assignments that were applied to the processes to manage the contradictory performances across the performance criteria this method revealed that the ann model with the highest weight 0 999 was the best performing followed by mars anfis and so on the svr on the other hand was found to be the least ranked model 3 3 contribution analysis due to the superior predictive ability of the ann model ann was utilized to study the contribution of the inputs i e hr p da dm qa qm ws rh and t that were utilized to model the wdel the connection weights acquired from the ann architecture were used to generate the contribution ratios for each input training as a result of this technique it was possible to determine which inputs were most effective at generating the model s output predictions fig 6 illustrates wdel prediction s contribution ratio values for each input variable as illustrated in this figure da 17 5 and hr 16 3 were the most influential factors while qm and ws came in third and fourth with a contribution ratio of 12 57 and 12 19 respectively the t rh and p had a moderate effect with their contribution ratio values of 9 96 9 02 and 8 99 respectively according to playán et al 2005 al ghobari et al 2018 and sarwar et al 2019 t and rh are contributing variables in wdel under a variety of technical and operational conditions molle et al 2012 demonstrate that droplet evaporation is t and rh dependent with evaporation occurring as a result of the difference between the actual and saturation water vapor pressures at a certain ambient air temperature i e vapor pressure deficit when the surrounding air has a high rh the droplets evaporate more slowly due to the low vapor pressure deficit resulting in inadequate energy to convert the droplet s sensible heat to latent heat 4 conclusion wind drift and evaporation losses wdel are the wide range of sprinkler water application losses that are the most important factors required for irrigation system management and design the artificial neural network ann the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis the multivariate adaptive regression spline mars the probabilistic linear regression plr and the support vector regression svr were used to develop models that could predict of wdel using design operational and meteorological variables in sprinkler irrigation these models were trained and tested using datasets from climates and sprinklers published by other researchers according to the statistical evaluation criteria and shannon s entropy based decision theory the ann model outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy the svr model produced high error implying that the prediction values were less accurate in addition the mars model ranked second followed by anfis and plr models the auxiliary nozzle diameter of sprinkler and wind speed were dominating design and climate variables producing a robust predictive model incorporating the air temperature and relative humidity into the modeling process via the vapor pressure deficit is desirable in brief ann was a reliable and powerful prediction tool for modeling wdel in the sprinkler irrigation system using the developed ann model irrigation system managers could adjust various field operations to maximize water efficiency during the growth season lowering wdel in various meteorological situations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests
