11365,evapotranspiration et is one of the key parameters in water and energy balance equation according to fao 56 crop evapotranspiration etc is calculated from multiplying reference evapotranspiration et0 by crop coefficient kc but due to excessive simplification of kc curve in the fao approach potential evapotranspiration etp would be miscalculated therefore accurate estimates of etp entail improving kc estimates in this study kc curves of early and late planted winter wheat were obtained based on two main satellite based methods 1 ratio approach 2 vegetation indices vis approach in the ratio approach basal crop coefficient kcb and single crop coefficient kc was directly calculated from the ratio of potential transpiration tp to et0 using swap and etp to et0 using swap and the priestly taylor equation respectively the vi approach makes use of landsat 7 etm and 8 oli and also modis imagery in order to extract soil adjusted vegetation index savi the kcb curves were evaluated against field measured leaf area index lai in 2014 15 growing season after each kc curve was modeled net irrigation requirement nir was calculated on daily and season basis results showed that the swap approach was weak in estimating the kcb and kc curves especially at the late season stage the vi approach could properly detect changes in vegetation cover during an entire growing season but when it came to kc curve modelling the vi approach was limited to the values given in fao 56 however the priestly taylor approach compensated for this limitation therefore yielded more sensible trends in kc curves results indicated that the vi approach reduced estimates of nir of late planted winter wheat compared with the fao recommended approach by 5 37 the priestly taylor approach resulted 21 72 and 0 32 lower nir compared with the fao recommended approach respectively for early and late planted winter wheat the decrease in nir from satellite based approaches derived from more realistic kc curves during the entire growing season overall making use of the satellite based approaches could improve water management on regional scales keywords crop coefficient potential evapotranspiration priestly taylor swap vegetation indices 1 introduction a very large age of the water absorbed by crops is spent on evapotranspiration et therefore accurate estimates of et are necessary for regional water consumption management allen et al 1998 simplified crop growth curve and subsequently introduced an approach for estimating crop evapotranspiration under optimum conditions etp by multiplying reference evapotranspiration et0 by crop coefficient kc kc is the quantitative form of the growth of a crop in time and it is also called crop growth curve two methods of calculating kc are single crop coefficient and dual crop coefficient allen et al 1998 single crop coefficient is directly calculated from the ratio of etp to et0 eq 1 1 k c et p et 0 etp is the upper limit of the crop evapotranspiration etc the upper limit refers to the condition with no water and fertility stress pests salinity and diseases which have negative effects on crop growth process or on the amount of etc allen et al 1998 in the dual crop coefficient approach the transpiration t and evaporation e factors are calculated separately eq 2 so kc is divided into basal crop coefficient kcb and soil evaporation coefficient ke which are representative of t and e respectively 2 k cb k e et p et 0 in the absence of water stress kcb is the ratio of potential transpiration tp to et0 3 k cb t p et 0 kc and kcb curves are plotted using the lengths of the four stages of crop growth and the crop coefficients of different stages but due to the empirical nature of these crop coefficients they might exert error on final etp under different climatic and soil conditions neale et al 1990 consequently this error leads to underestimation or overestimation of net irrigation requirement nir of crops during a growing season therefore irrigation scheduling would face critical problems and a large amount of water is wasted because of unrealistic kc estimates one of the most effective solutions to surface and underground water resources management and optimizing their consumption in agriculture is to determine accurate kc curves for each crop in different climatic conditions kamble et al 2013 etp can be measured using weighing lysimeters eddy correlation and bowen ratio techniques with high accuracy but these methods introduce et for a small area which cannot be generalized to a whole region and also these methods can be time consuming and costly because of these kinds of limitations remote sensing became more practical in etp estimations bastiaanssen et al 1998 making use of satellite imagery in kc calculation is the fastest yet accurate method on a large scale many studies have been done on etc calculation using energy balance equation associated with taking advantage of remotely sensed images jensen and haise 1963 bastiaanssen et al 1998 samani 2000 bastiaanssen et al 2002 these studies only focused on estimating satellite based etc and no kc curves were represented crop growth simulation models are based on more complicated models but more accurate estimates of etp are concluded swap is one of the most popular models it is an agro hydrological model which calculates etp considering water balance and making use of the penman monteith equation kroes et al 2008 penman monteith was introduced as the most accurate equation by fao allen et al 1998 jensen et al 1990 evaluated 20 different evapotranspiration equations using lysimeter data for 11 stations around the world under different climatic conditions the penman monteith equation was concluded as the most accurate of them all however the natural environment is temporally and spatially dynamic and the crop growth simulation models are not based on real world changes of vegetation cover but only mathematical equations therefore assimilating satellite observations such as leaf area index lai which is a crop growth curve by itself into models would exert real world growth rate of crops in time and place on crop growth simulation process the penman monteith equation as a combination formula requires several crop and meteorological input data accordingly this formula was simplified by priestly and taylor 1974 and etp was calculated using only the energy flux part of the penman monteith equation satellite imagery which contains multispectral and thermal bands such as landsat made it possible to calculate priestly taylor based etp with proper accuracy bastiaanssen et al 1998 in sebal algorithm introduced an energy balance based approach for estimating etc using multispectral and thermal bands of landsat imagery afterwards parody and gabriel 2002 in ahas algorithm which was based on sebal showed that etp can be calculated by the means of landsat imagery using the priestly taylor equation green leaves absorb the red portion of the electromagnetic radiation of sunlight from 0 4 to 0 7 μm in order to perform photosynthesis and due to cellular structure of leaves a large amount of near infrared near ir light from 0 7 to 1 1 μm is reflected so the amount of radiation absorbed or reflected is highly depended on intensity of green crops in a surface area weier and herring 2015 therefore different vegetation indices vis such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi rouse et al 1974 soil adjusted vegetation index savi houte et al 1988 weighted difference vegetation index wdvi clevers 1988 etc are developed on this concept and are based on red and near ir bands of different sensors vis are used for monitoring health size and intensity of crops and vi time curve indicates alterations in greenness of a crop so practically it can be identified as crop growth curve kcb curve modelling is possible using satellite based vis with proper accuracy jackson et al 1980 many studies have been conducted calculating crop coefficients and estimating nir from satellite imagery with acceptable accuracy using the relationship between vis and kcb gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 singh and irmak 2009 gontia and tiwari 2010 melton et al 2012 mateos et al 2013 gonzález dugo et al 2013 kamble et al 2013 in this study we compared different methods of kcb and kc estimations based on remote sensing the priestly taylor approach for etp estimation was modified and improved using the combination of landsat and modis imagery and then kc values were calculated four methods of kcb and kc curves simulation are 1 vi approach using landsat and modis images 2 priestly taylor approach using landsat and modis images 3 the swap model approach by assimilating lai into the model and 4 fao recommended approach these approaches were evaluated against field measured lai time series in addition the effect of each approach on nir estimation was investigated and then compared with fao recommended approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in 2014 15 growing season study area was located in the qazvin irrigation network fig 1 with arid climate conditions agricultural planning economic and rural development research institute aperdri and average annual rainfall of 100 mm long term meteorological data study fields were selected from the farms of the hezarjolfa agro industry company hezarjolfa situated at 36 8ʹ n and 50 11ʹ e eastern side of the qazvin irrigation network in abyek country the hezarjolfa agro industry company with 850 ha field area and approximately 1200 m above the sea level is limited to the east by the hezarjolfa village to the south by the abdol abad village to the west by the magsal agro industry company and it is 10 km south of the city of mohammadiye comprising five center pivots and a few classic and surface irrigation systems the climate is semi arid and predominant soil texture is sandy loam wheat barley and canola are usually cultivated in the winter and maize and sugar beet are the spring crops cp 2 wheat and the east side of cp 4 wheat were chosen for nir calculation the meteorological data were obtained from the magsal station located at 500 m to the west from the hezarjolfa agro industry company with latitude of 36 9ʹ n and longitude of 50 10ʹ 12ʹʹ e 2 2 field measurements crop growth curves of winter wheat were studied in this paper winter wheat in cp 4 was planted in 27 september 2014 and the other one was planted in 19 november 2014 and both of them were harvested in 28 june 2015 field measured data were soil hydraulic parameters lai for early and late planted winter wheat table 1 and also the time and depth of irrigation events table 2 lai measurement plots were based on modis pixels such that the least mixed pixel was chosen for further calculations each plot comprised 3 subplots lai samples were collected from each subplot destructively and the average value of every three subplots of each pixel was representative of the lai of the whole plot the sampling was done every 7 to 10 days and samples were transported to laboratory on standard conditions then leaf surface area of each subplot was measured using deltat device uk jonckheere et al 2004 which does the measurement by taking digital photos from leaves and lai was calculated by dividing the measured leaf surface area to the subplot surface area in the end a lai time series during an entire growing season were obtained for early and late planted winter wheat these lai time curves were showing the growth of each crop which were used for kcb curve evaluation samples for estimating soil texture and bulk density were collected by the means of a core sampler in four layers of soil from 0 to 80 cm table 3 the samples were transported to laboratory and soil texture was analyzed using the hydrometer method associated with textural triangle bouyoucos 1962 in order to determine bulk density the samples were dried out in oven at 105 c for 24 h and then weighed the ratio of dry mass of the soil sample to the volume of the sample was defined as bulk density buckman and brady 1960 irrigation time and depth and soil organic matter data were obtained from irrigation register office and soil information office of the hezarjolfa agro industry company respectively for both growing seasons all these data were utilized in swap simulation process 2 3 satellite and meteorological datasets in this study crop coefficients were calculated using landsat 7 etm tir and landsat 8 oli tirs imagery modis daily surface reflectance and land surface temperature lst products associated with digital elevation model dem meteorological data were obtained from the magsal station more details are presented in table 4 2 4 the fao recommended approach for kc and kcb estimations the kcb and kc curves could be plotted by possessing the lengths of the quadruple stages and also crop coefficients of initial kc cb ini middle kc cb mid and late season kc cb end of winter wheat maximum and minimum kc and kcb kc cb max and kc cb min respectively and the lengths of the stages were obtained from allen et al 1998 kc max and kcb max were modified using wind speed and minimum relative humidity eq 62 65 and 70 in fao 56 kc cb ini kc cb mid and kc cb end along with length of the growth stage are shown in table 5 2 5 the ratio approach for kc and kcb estimations in this method kc was directly calculated by dividing etp to et0 eq 1 and kcb by dividing tp to et0 eq 3 daily values of et0 were calculated using the penman monteith equation the ratio approach was conducted in two ways 1 simulating tp and etp using swap after assimilation of remotely sensed lai 2 calculating etp from the priestly taylor equation by using multispectral and thermal bands of landsat and modis in estimating daily net radiation 2 5 1 potential transpiration tp and potential evapotranspiration etp simulation using swap swap calculates tp and etp using the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 1981 4 et p δ λ w r n daily g p 1 air c air λ w e sat e a r air δ γ 1 r crop r air where rn daily is the daily net radiation j m 2 d 1 δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 λw is the latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 g is the soil heat flux j m 2 d 1 p1 is conversion factor

psychrometric constant kpa c 1 rcrop is the crop resistance s m 1 and rair is the air resistance s m 1 for the purpose of tp and etp estimation first the model calculates three parameters including potential evapotranspiration rate of a wet etw0 and dry etp0 canopy completely covering the soil and potential evaporation rate of a wet bare soil ep0 using the penman monteith equation these quantities are calculated by varying values for crop resistance crop height and albedo in the penman monteith equation when the canopy cover is wet rcrop is considered 0 when the canopy cover is dry assuming that the crop has no limitations for water uptake rcrop varies between 30 s d 1 for arable crops and 150 s d 1 for forest trees allen and pruitt 1986 allen et al 1989 when soil is wet with no canopy cover rcrop is 0 and the crop height is 0 1 cm albedo is considered 0 15 under bare soil condition and 0 23 when the ground is covered with crops then the potential evaporation ep and tp were separately calculated using etw0 etp0 and ep0 as follows and etp was obtained by addition of these two parameters 5 e p e p0 e κ gr lai 6 t p 1 w frac et p0 e p w i t h t p 0 where k gr is the extinction coefficient for global solar radiation 0 39 wfrac is the fraction of the day that the crop is wet and it is a function of etw0 and the daily amount of intercepted precipitation pi von hoyningen huene 1981 braden 1985 in this study in order to obtain accurate kc and kcb curves we had to either calibrate the model using numerous types of data series or assimilate satellite derived crop parameters into the model since we did not have access to field measured crop parameters for the whole growing seasons the data assimilation method was preferred eq 5 and eq 6 emphasize the importance of accurate lai values during a growing season in crop coefficient curve simulation an increase in lai causes a decrease in ep which consequently leads to higher values of tp mokhtari et al 2018 found that modis based savi had the best performance in lai estimation in the hezarjolfa fields they derived an empirical regression equation for winter wheat lai estimation using savi extracted from the modis daily surface reflectance product table 1 therefore in this study lai during the entire growing season was calculated by making use of the best fit regression equation presented in mokhtari et al 2018 and then assimilated into swap using a simple sequential updating algorithm vazifedoust et al 2009 therefore more accurate output data was expected 2 5 2 potential evapotranspiration etp calculation using the priestly taylor equation priesty taylor based etp calculation procedure was adapted from parodi and gabriel 2002 instructions and modified in this study the calculations were conducted by the means of landsat 7 and 8 imagery and modis lst product associated with meteorological data obtained from the magsal station eq 7 to eq 12 7 et p 1 26 δ δ γ r n rn was the subtraction of outgoing surface longwave rl and shortwave rs radiations from incoming surface longwave rl and shortwave rs radiations watt m 2 this parameter represents the amount of energy absorbed by the earth s surface δ and γ were calculated using air temperature from meteorological data and atmospheric pressure derived from dem respectively walter et al 2000 rs was calculated as suggested in hargreaves and samani 1982 rs is the fraction of rs which is reflected from the earth s surface and is determined using the broadband surface albedo α α was estimated using a weighted sum of landsat surface reflectance for each band waters et al 2002 rl and rl were obtained considering the stefan boltzman law which describes the radiance of an object in terms of its temperature to the fourth power they were respectively calculated using surface temperature obtained from satellite imagery and daily average air temperature from the magsal station in this study we chose to remove errors caused by converting instantaneous etp to daily etp by directly calculating daily etp from the priestly taylor equation so daily rl was required for this purpose therefore given that the lst derived from landsat thermal bands corresponds to the temperature at the time of image acquisition the modis lst product from both terra and aqua satellites were taken into account table 3 these products are composed of daytime and nighttime lsts which the average of them was assumed to be the daily lst of a pixel terra daytime and nighttime lsts are available at approximately 10 30 am and 10 30 pm local time respectively and aqua data are being acquired at 1 30 pm and 1 30 am for daytime and nighttime lsts respectively spatial resolution of modis imagery was relatively low 1000 m in the lst products and they were unsuitable for the medium sized farms of hezarjolfa therefore assuming that ndvi is constant in a day and has a strong relationship with daily average lst sun and kafatos 2007 the tsharp algorithm kustas et al 2003 agam et al 2007 was used for downscaling daily average modis lst to landsat spatial resolution so it could be used in fields with typical sizes the kc curves were obtained from the priestly taylor approach using following steps winter wheat farms were chosen and subsetted from the images 5 to 6 random polygons were drawn for each farm fig 2 and then time series of etp of each polygon was extracted the kc curves were obtained by dividing the etp time series derived from landsat imagery to et0 of the same days the calculated kc time series were linearly interpolated and smoothed in order to obtain daily kc curve 2 6 the vegetation indices approach for kc and kcb estimation the level of health and growth of a crop could be determined by calculating vis of a pixel over a crop field savi is one of the most widely used indices for estimating crop parameters this index is highly sensitive to variations of lai moran et al 1995 and the fraction of the ground which is covered by vegetation fc heilman et al 1982 jackson and huete 1991 the savi time series is an independent crop growth curve therefore make the extraction of the kcb curve from savi feasible bausch and neale 1987 neale et al 1990 savi has linear relationship with fc along the whole range of vegetation cover huete et al 1985 choudhury et al 1994 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 accordingly in this study eq 8 was used for fc estimation 8 fc savi savi min savi max savi min where savimin and savimax are the minimum and maximum values of savi for fc 0 and fc 1 respectively in this study irrigation and rain intervals were relatively long so the assumption of linear relationship between kcb and fc was true allen et al 2005a b allen et al 2005c paço et al 2012 if fc 0 kcb is minimum and if fc is a value slightly smaller than 1 kcb would be at its maximum level allen and pereira 2009 considering the aforementioned assumptions and the fact that kcb reaches its maximum level before the full ground cover fraction fcmax is occurred eq 9 would be reasonable 9 k cb min k cb max k cb max f c max f c where fcmax was considered 0 85 for winter wheat steduto et al 2012 mateos et al 2013 presented eqs 10a and 10b using the daily soil root zone water balance model in gonzalez dugo et al 2009 10a k c k c bare soil 1 k c bare soil k cb if k cb 1 10b k c 1 k c max 1 k cb max 1 k cb 1 if k cb 1 in order to make the method continuous when kcb is larger than 1 a straight line from 1 1 to kcb max kc max was indicative of the relationship between these two parameters allen et al 2005a showed that kc ini is determined as soon as crops are planted under the conditions of no vegetation cover or sparse vegetation cover therefore kc ini from fao 56 was used as an alternative to kc bare soil the calculation of kcb and kc was done using savi derived from landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli imagery determination of the locations of the polygons was similar to section 2 5 2 fig 2 in addition to landsat imagery the modis daily surface reflectance product table 3 was utilized in order to fill the time gaps between the landsat images the purest pixels were used for the kcb and kc calculations because these pixels showed more sensible trends in savi time series 2 7 net irrigation requirement calculation in this study nir was calculated using eq 11 daily and total nir resulted from each approach was investigated against the fao recommended approach 11 nir k c et 0 p e where pe is the effective rain mm the first term on the right side of eq 11 represents etp 3 results and discussions 3 1 field measurements 3 1 1 leaf area index the field measured lai time series of winter wheat was obtained and illustrated in fig 3 early planted winter wheat cp 4 lai was not available from the planting date until 3 march 2015 fig 3b due to the preparation of the measuring instruments and common bureaucracy problems therefore no lai data were obtained for the initial and half of the development stages the peak lai occurred in the middle of spring for both early and late planted winter wheat however early planted winter wheat reached the peak lai 15 days sooner than the late planted winter wheat and this was because of the earlier planting of the crop cp 2 winter wheat was planted on 17 november 2014 table 1 thus before the initial stage was over and the crop entered the development stage a cold weather hit the region and resulted in winter wheat dormancy and hindered its growth consequently the initial stage was prolonged until it revived from dormancy at the beginning of march where air temperature increased gradually on the other hand winter wheat in cp 4 was planted during the warmth of the beginning of autumn therefore due to proper temperature conditions a short initial stage was expected and it probably entered the middle stage before winter came 3 1 2 relationship between leaf area index and savi regardless of the planting dates the relationship between all the measured lai put together and savi extracted from modis and landsat imagery is illustrated in fig 4 the relationship was approximately linear on the one hand the kcb curves were calculated on the basis of linear equations eq 8 and eq 9 as a function of fc obtained from savi on the other hand lai bears a strong resemblance to fc nielsen et al 2012 ramírez garcía et al 2012 so subsequently it can be implied that the lai variability along the entire growing season had approximately linear relationship with kcb therefore the lai time series were taken into account for validation of the kcb curves the advantage of the landsat imagery to the images acquired by the modis sensor is their higher spatial resolution completely pure pixels were rarely available in the modis images but smaller farms could be studied using the images obtained by oli and etm sensors in this study due to mixed pixels of the modis images a lower coefficient of determination was yielded r2 of 0 765 in modis and 0 82 in landsat the purity of landsat pixels resulted in a wider range of savi variability during the whole growing season however the lai sampling dates did not always coincide with the landsat data acquisition dates in order to estimate lai corresponding to the date of the landsat images the field measured lai curves were interpolated using a weighted linear method viña et al 2011 inevitably this method caused dispersing of the points from the regression line in savi lai curve and consequently the root mean square error rmse slightly increased the regression line in landsat derived savi was more linear than modis derived savi especially in higher values of lai or in other words savi calculated from the modis images saturated at smaller values of lai about 2 5 m2 m 2 against 3 5 m2 m 2 therefore in spite of lower temporal resolution landsat was more efficient in detecting green vegetation cover during the entire growing season 3 2 kcb evaluation kcb curves of early and late planted winter wheat were obtained using the fao recommended vi and ratio approaches for an entire growing season fig 5 late planted winter wheat was planted in late autumn so quickly confronted the cold season after emergence and went into dormancy period therefore it had no time to fully grow up to complete the initial stage the initial stage prolonged until the weather gradually got warmer and the winter wheat dormancy came to an end fig 3a at this point the crop started to grow up quickly the initial stages in the vi and fao based kcb curves have considerable differences fig 5a the initial stage of late planted winter wheat lasted until late february fig 3a while the vi based kcb curve started to rise in late january but the fao recommended and swap approaches properly modeled the length of the initial stage the length of the initial stage in the swap approach was more convenient than the vi approach the curve line started from the value of 0 09 and then gradually entered the next stage in the fao recommended approach this stage was indicated by a horizontal line equal to 0 15 then suddenly and abnormally entered the development stage whereas in real world crops grow gradually the field measured lai curve was stating that the initial stage started from lai 0 fc 0 at the planting date until it germinated and gradually entered the development stage also when soil has no vegetation cover transpiration rate is equal to zero kcb 0 and when a crop grows tp increases subsequently gradual increase of kcb curve in spite of the vi derived kcb curves deficiencies they displayed this fact more properly compared to the other approaches the average value of et0 of the cold season was about 0 95 mm so it can be concluded that this period has no significant effects on nir final values therefore regarding the weaknesses of the vi approach in proper detection of an accurate date corresponding to the start of the development stage it simulated more logical trends in kcb variability at the initial stage of early planted winter wheat the development stage lasted until late april fig 3a all the approaches were successful in accurate simulation of the second stage considering the fact that kcb reaches its maximum value before the maximum vegetation cover occurs the middle stage was indicated by a horizontal line since the winter wheat middle stage occurred in a warm season higher values of et0 and also kcb in this stage was considered the maximum value of kcb along the entire growing season the accurate simulation of kcb was essential for generating more realistic estimates of nir swap derived kcb rose to the maximum value of 1 014 m2 m 2 which considering the well managed and full irrigation conditions of the hezarjolfa study fields no water and fertility stress this value was unreliable fao derived kcb indicated that the middle stage terminated at 10 june 2015 which according to the measured lai curve fig 3a the lai value corresponding to this date was about 1 m2 m 2 which was unreasonably low compared to lai of the beginning of the middle stage which was about 3 5 m2 m 2 so it can be concluded that the fao recommended approach poorly simulated the mid season stage in late planted winter wheat but in the vi approach the lai value at the beginning of the middle stage was approximately same as the lai value at the end of the middle stage about 3 8 m2 m 2 for landsat images and 3 5 m2 m 2 for modis images which was more logical then the middle stage was completed and the kcb curve declined gradually the yellowness of winter wheat at late season caused an increase in the reflectance of the red portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and reduced the near ir reflectance from the crop therefore savi at the end of the growing season decreased but was still larger than the savi value immediately after planting savi values of bare soil consequently kcb end was larger than kcb ini 0 whereas winter wheat harvesting was done when the crop color completely turned to yellow or in other words the crop was dead so tp should have been 0 kcb 0 hence none of the approaches was successful in considering this fact when winter wheat is planted early it would quickly pass the initial stage before the cold season comes and the crop starts the middle stage before dormancy the primary measured values of lai of early planted winter wheat was not available fig 3b therefore according to the early planted winter wheat kcb curves derived from the vi approach fig 5b it can be concluded that winter wheat planted in early autumn passed the initial and development stages in less than 30 days as soon as the winter wheat dormancy started the vi based kcb curves declined smoothly due to the slight decrease in leaf surface area caused by cold air temperature and no irrigation during the cold season then on 3 march 2015 where the first sample was collected the crop confronted the warmness of late winter and started to grow again so the crop growth was incremental until it reached its maximum on 22 april 2015 fig 3b therefore the vi approach performed best compared with other approaches generally according to the trends in the savi variations the middle stage was divided into two steps 1 before dormancy and 2 after dormancy the fao recommended approach couldn t detect the first step swap was significantly underestimating kcb in the period where lai was at its peak second part of the middle stage as it was also observed in late planted winter wheat the model assumed that the winter wheat harvest was done before the crop has completely yellowed so transpiration surface area was considered unusually high kcb end was a value larger than 0 in all the approaches so it did not match the reality as discussed above but in general according to lai time series fig 3a and b the vi approach performed best for the entire growing season in early and late planted winter wheat the length of time between planting date and full vegetation cover vary with climate latitude elevation above sea level crop variety and planting date allen et al 1998 both early and late planted winter wheat were planted under similar conditions of climate cultivar latitude and elevation except planting date therefore the significant difference between kcb curves of early and late planted winter wheat arose from the disparate planting dates overall it would be essential to obtain three growth curves including early mid and late planted curves for each crop in every region in principle fao recommended kcb curves had sudden changes from one growth stage to another while in reality crop grows gradually which its rate varies for different stages due to the fact that satellites continuously observe the changes to earth s surface and field measured lai curves the trends in kcb derived from savi was properly simulated but swap performed poorly and the reason was the mathematical equations which were developed despite our lack of knowledge about every process that affects et 3 3 kc evaluation kc curves of early and late planted winter wheat were obtained using the fao recommended vi and ratio approaches for an entire growing season and the results are illustrated in fig 6 swap was not able to properly simulate late season stage of late planted winter wheat for example the swap derived kc curve was persistently ascending for the whole growing season and the reduction in green vegetation was not considered because of the excessive values of tp at the end of the growing season also the values of the kc of early planted winter wheat started from 1 005 which was unusually for winter wheat in the vi approach landsat and modis derived almost similar trends for each crop because according to section 3 1 2 they both showed high accuracy in savi lai relationship the kc variations along the entire growing season were more logical and were in more compliance with real world vegetation cover variability compared with the fao recommended approach during initial stage under bare soil or partially bare soil conditions the main part of etp is composed of ep allen et al 1998 indicated that kc ini is a function of several atmosphere soil and management parameters such as evaporation power of the atmosphere et0 irrigation depth and frequency therefore calculation of kc ini requires irrigation and soil moisture parameters which cannot be obtained at a reasonable time and cost for a region hence inevitably kc ini and subsequently kc end in vi approach were limited to the values presented in fao 56 and therefore climate and precipitation conditions weren t considered in the model in order to solve this issue we used the priestly taylor equation for etp calculation to directly estimate kc from the ratio of etp to et0 in addition to the bands affected by green vegetation cover variability the priestly taylor approach made use of thermal and shortwave infrared swir bands and also air temperature for estimation of kc therefore more soil moisture and vegetation water content which highly absorb swir light and emit lower thermal energy and also the evaporation power of the atmosphere took part in the kc calculation kc ini at the initial stage of winter wheat was lower than the fao curve due to the small irrigation depths in both early and late planted winter wheat and low temperature and radiation conditions in the winter affecting late planted winter wheat considering the fact that lst and albedo time series was not used in swap kc ini was high in winter wheat fig 6 the advantage of this approach was using the thermal band for simulating the effect of temperature on crop growth process this effect was observable in winter wheat which confronted the dormancy period winter wheat requires average maximum temperature between 20 30 c to grow at optimum rate and prolonged periods below 5 c cause dormancy in winter wheat steduto et al 2012 in our study area air temperature went down below 5 c between 10 december 2014 and 19 february 2015 fig 7 so this period was considered as the dormancy period the dormancy period is also illustrated in early and late planted winter wheat diagrams with grey vertical dashes fig 6a and b therefore results showed that the effect of low temperature on wheat was more explicit in the priestly taylor approach the low temperature caused a decrease in vegetation greenness with delay thus the winter wheat dormancy period was observed with almost a month and a half delay in the vi approach where temperature rose up to about 12 c also the evaporative power of the atmosphere was not considered in the vi approach therefore the decrease in the kc curve was less severe than that of the priestly taylor approach during the dormancy when the weather is cold et is mainly depends on aerodynamic conditions and prevailing low temperature which highly limit the growth of a crop that is while solar radiation and vapor pressure significantly decrease so consequently the rate of et is reduced zhang et al 2004 the trends in etp in both early and late planted winter wheat during the entire growing season are illustrated in fig 8 as soon as winter wheat went into dormancy etp dropped down to approximately 0 mm d 1 and 0 35 mm d 1 in late and early planted winter wheat respectively similar results were found in shao et al 2011 and irmak et al 2015 thermal and swir portions of the radiation are highly influenced by water content of soil and crop so the values of albedo and lst decreased after each irrigation and rain events also albedo and lst are affected by many atmospheric conditions that cause their values to fluctuate during a year hence using the priestly taylor approach requires knowledge about different agricultural management practices corresponding to the crops under assessment and an agricultural background in order to better identify the trends in kc variability however this approach allowed us to extract more logical and realistic kc curves by augmenting the calculation process with more environmental parameters generally in spite of the weaknesses and limitations found in the satellite based methods the vi and priestly taylor approaches they can have better results rather than the fao recommended approach due to continuous observation of changes to earth s surface and atmosphere these approaches are also less costly and require less time to conduct compared to measuring techniques 3 4 net irrigation requirement calculation nir was calculated for winter wheat with two different planting dates on daily and season basis results are presented in table 6 swap had the highest nir for the entire growing season due to the overestimation of kc at the late season stage fig 6 so subsequently nir at this stage was also overestimated fig 9 due to higher spatial resolution and proper temporal resolution landsat imagery is suggested for crop growth curve extraction the landsat based vi approach compared with the fao recommended approach reduced nir of the entire growing season by 5 37 in late planted winter wheat nir resulted from the priestly taylor approach was reduced in both early and late planted winter wheat by 0 32 and 21 72 respectively the decrease in nir derived from the satellite based approaches in late planted winter wheat arose from the decrease in the lengths of the middle stages the irrigation systems were designed based on the kc curve of fao total irrigation depths during early and late planted winter wheat were 40 mm higher and 65 mm lower than fao derived nir respectively which considering the conditions of labor rainfall events and irrigation systems performance the irrigation management were well applied but regarding nir obtained from the priestly taylor approach irrigation depths or number of irrigation events in late planted winter wheat could be reduced in order to prevent water loss it should be noted that any increase in nir does not mean that the method is incorrect but optimizing water consumption is authentic if crop yield does not decrease also it is necessary to actualize kc curves of crops in order to provide adequate water during a whole growing season according to eq 1 etp was directly affected by et0 and kc fluctuations so consequently daily nir was a function of these two parameters kc at the initial and development stages of late planted winter wheat in the priestly taylor approach was lower compared to the other approaches fig 6a subsequently priestly taylor derived nir was the lowest followed by vi landsat vi modis fao and swap fig 9 after late planted winter wheat was planted air temperature started to decrease and a heavy irrigation was occurred therefore the need of the crop to water dropped below the no water requirement line as the warm season started air temperature increased after mid february fig 7 which is why heavy irrigation events are observed in this period in order to provide sufficient water for the crop however considering the priestly taylor curve and also adequate rainfall in the first half of the growing season the farm administration could remove the second to fourth irrigation events and reduce the depths of irrigation water in the second half in order to prevent water loss according to the priestly taylor curve the early planted winter wheat was relatively well irrigated maybe the removal of the second or the third irrigation event would not harm the crop due to the close intervals of rainfall events from about 10th march until 10th april the crop water requirement of early planted winter wheat declined and then as soon as it entered the middle stage in early april the curve started to increase until the end of the growing season the daily crop water requirements of both crops increased at the late season stage which was due to the increasing air temperature associated with low rainfall in principle calculating more accurate kc curves during an entire growing season especially in middle stage period has the most effect in water consumption optimization because on the one hand this stage usually occurs during the warm months and on the other hand kc is at its peak value so high values of etp are compounded during this period generally proper irrigation scheduling and determination of more accurate irrigation depth and frequency could be achieved by calculating kc using satellite imagery 4 conclusions the kc and kcb curves of early and late planted winter wheat were estimated using the fao recommended vi and ratio approaches the vi approach was conducted using modis and landsat imagery and the ratio approach was included the priestly taylor and swap approaches kcb was evaluated against field measured lai results showed that kcb calculated using vis extracted from satellite imagery was in more compliance with the trends in field measured lai rather than other approaches also it was indicated that planting date considerably affects the kcb and kc variations during an entire growing season the kc curves analysis showed that the priestly taylor approach yielded more logical and more realistic curves the vi approach reduced nir compared to the fao recommended approach by 5 37 in late planted winter wheat the priestly taylor approach also reduced nir in both late and early planted winter wheat 21 72 0 32 respectively taking the satellite imagery into account for modelling crop growth curves would improve irrigation scheduling in a farm and better management practices could be implemented on regional scales 
11365,evapotranspiration et is one of the key parameters in water and energy balance equation according to fao 56 crop evapotranspiration etc is calculated from multiplying reference evapotranspiration et0 by crop coefficient kc but due to excessive simplification of kc curve in the fao approach potential evapotranspiration etp would be miscalculated therefore accurate estimates of etp entail improving kc estimates in this study kc curves of early and late planted winter wheat were obtained based on two main satellite based methods 1 ratio approach 2 vegetation indices vis approach in the ratio approach basal crop coefficient kcb and single crop coefficient kc was directly calculated from the ratio of potential transpiration tp to et0 using swap and etp to et0 using swap and the priestly taylor equation respectively the vi approach makes use of landsat 7 etm and 8 oli and also modis imagery in order to extract soil adjusted vegetation index savi the kcb curves were evaluated against field measured leaf area index lai in 2014 15 growing season after each kc curve was modeled net irrigation requirement nir was calculated on daily and season basis results showed that the swap approach was weak in estimating the kcb and kc curves especially at the late season stage the vi approach could properly detect changes in vegetation cover during an entire growing season but when it came to kc curve modelling the vi approach was limited to the values given in fao 56 however the priestly taylor approach compensated for this limitation therefore yielded more sensible trends in kc curves results indicated that the vi approach reduced estimates of nir of late planted winter wheat compared with the fao recommended approach by 5 37 the priestly taylor approach resulted 21 72 and 0 32 lower nir compared with the fao recommended approach respectively for early and late planted winter wheat the decrease in nir from satellite based approaches derived from more realistic kc curves during the entire growing season overall making use of the satellite based approaches could improve water management on regional scales keywords crop coefficient potential evapotranspiration priestly taylor swap vegetation indices 1 introduction a very large age of the water absorbed by crops is spent on evapotranspiration et therefore accurate estimates of et are necessary for regional water consumption management allen et al 1998 simplified crop growth curve and subsequently introduced an approach for estimating crop evapotranspiration under optimum conditions etp by multiplying reference evapotranspiration et0 by crop coefficient kc kc is the quantitative form of the growth of a crop in time and it is also called crop growth curve two methods of calculating kc are single crop coefficient and dual crop coefficient allen et al 1998 single crop coefficient is directly calculated from the ratio of etp to et0 eq 1 1 k c et p et 0 etp is the upper limit of the crop evapotranspiration etc the upper limit refers to the condition with no water and fertility stress pests salinity and diseases which have negative effects on crop growth process or on the amount of etc allen et al 1998 in the dual crop coefficient approach the transpiration t and evaporation e factors are calculated separately eq 2 so kc is divided into basal crop coefficient kcb and soil evaporation coefficient ke which are representative of t and e respectively 2 k cb k e et p et 0 in the absence of water stress kcb is the ratio of potential transpiration tp to et0 3 k cb t p et 0 kc and kcb curves are plotted using the lengths of the four stages of crop growth and the crop coefficients of different stages but due to the empirical nature of these crop coefficients they might exert error on final etp under different climatic and soil conditions neale et al 1990 consequently this error leads to underestimation or overestimation of net irrigation requirement nir of crops during a growing season therefore irrigation scheduling would face critical problems and a large amount of water is wasted because of unrealistic kc estimates one of the most effective solutions to surface and underground water resources management and optimizing their consumption in agriculture is to determine accurate kc curves for each crop in different climatic conditions kamble et al 2013 etp can be measured using weighing lysimeters eddy correlation and bowen ratio techniques with high accuracy but these methods introduce et for a small area which cannot be generalized to a whole region and also these methods can be time consuming and costly because of these kinds of limitations remote sensing became more practical in etp estimations bastiaanssen et al 1998 making use of satellite imagery in kc calculation is the fastest yet accurate method on a large scale many studies have been done on etc calculation using energy balance equation associated with taking advantage of remotely sensed images jensen and haise 1963 bastiaanssen et al 1998 samani 2000 bastiaanssen et al 2002 these studies only focused on estimating satellite based etc and no kc curves were represented crop growth simulation models are based on more complicated models but more accurate estimates of etp are concluded swap is one of the most popular models it is an agro hydrological model which calculates etp considering water balance and making use of the penman monteith equation kroes et al 2008 penman monteith was introduced as the most accurate equation by fao allen et al 1998 jensen et al 1990 evaluated 20 different evapotranspiration equations using lysimeter data for 11 stations around the world under different climatic conditions the penman monteith equation was concluded as the most accurate of them all however the natural environment is temporally and spatially dynamic and the crop growth simulation models are not based on real world changes of vegetation cover but only mathematical equations therefore assimilating satellite observations such as leaf area index lai which is a crop growth curve by itself into models would exert real world growth rate of crops in time and place on crop growth simulation process the penman monteith equation as a combination formula requires several crop and meteorological input data accordingly this formula was simplified by priestly and taylor 1974 and etp was calculated using only the energy flux part of the penman monteith equation satellite imagery which contains multispectral and thermal bands such as landsat made it possible to calculate priestly taylor based etp with proper accuracy bastiaanssen et al 1998 in sebal algorithm introduced an energy balance based approach for estimating etc using multispectral and thermal bands of landsat imagery afterwards parody and gabriel 2002 in ahas algorithm which was based on sebal showed that etp can be calculated by the means of landsat imagery using the priestly taylor equation green leaves absorb the red portion of the electromagnetic radiation of sunlight from 0 4 to 0 7 μm in order to perform photosynthesis and due to cellular structure of leaves a large amount of near infrared near ir light from 0 7 to 1 1 μm is reflected so the amount of radiation absorbed or reflected is highly depended on intensity of green crops in a surface area weier and herring 2015 therefore different vegetation indices vis such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi rouse et al 1974 soil adjusted vegetation index savi houte et al 1988 weighted difference vegetation index wdvi clevers 1988 etc are developed on this concept and are based on red and near ir bands of different sensors vis are used for monitoring health size and intensity of crops and vi time curve indicates alterations in greenness of a crop so practically it can be identified as crop growth curve kcb curve modelling is possible using satellite based vis with proper accuracy jackson et al 1980 many studies have been conducted calculating crop coefficients and estimating nir from satellite imagery with acceptable accuracy using the relationship between vis and kcb gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 singh and irmak 2009 gontia and tiwari 2010 melton et al 2012 mateos et al 2013 gonzález dugo et al 2013 kamble et al 2013 in this study we compared different methods of kcb and kc estimations based on remote sensing the priestly taylor approach for etp estimation was modified and improved using the combination of landsat and modis imagery and then kc values were calculated four methods of kcb and kc curves simulation are 1 vi approach using landsat and modis images 2 priestly taylor approach using landsat and modis images 3 the swap model approach by assimilating lai into the model and 4 fao recommended approach these approaches were evaluated against field measured lai time series in addition the effect of each approach on nir estimation was investigated and then compared with fao recommended approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in 2014 15 growing season study area was located in the qazvin irrigation network fig 1 with arid climate conditions agricultural planning economic and rural development research institute aperdri and average annual rainfall of 100 mm long term meteorological data study fields were selected from the farms of the hezarjolfa agro industry company hezarjolfa situated at 36 8ʹ n and 50 11ʹ e eastern side of the qazvin irrigation network in abyek country the hezarjolfa agro industry company with 850 ha field area and approximately 1200 m above the sea level is limited to the east by the hezarjolfa village to the south by the abdol abad village to the west by the magsal agro industry company and it is 10 km south of the city of mohammadiye comprising five center pivots and a few classic and surface irrigation systems the climate is semi arid and predominant soil texture is sandy loam wheat barley and canola are usually cultivated in the winter and maize and sugar beet are the spring crops cp 2 wheat and the east side of cp 4 wheat were chosen for nir calculation the meteorological data were obtained from the magsal station located at 500 m to the west from the hezarjolfa agro industry company with latitude of 36 9ʹ n and longitude of 50 10ʹ 12ʹʹ e 2 2 field measurements crop growth curves of winter wheat were studied in this paper winter wheat in cp 4 was planted in 27 september 2014 and the other one was planted in 19 november 2014 and both of them were harvested in 28 june 2015 field measured data were soil hydraulic parameters lai for early and late planted winter wheat table 1 and also the time and depth of irrigation events table 2 lai measurement plots were based on modis pixels such that the least mixed pixel was chosen for further calculations each plot comprised 3 subplots lai samples were collected from each subplot destructively and the average value of every three subplots of each pixel was representative of the lai of the whole plot the sampling was done every 7 to 10 days and samples were transported to laboratory on standard conditions then leaf surface area of each subplot was measured using deltat device uk jonckheere et al 2004 which does the measurement by taking digital photos from leaves and lai was calculated by dividing the measured leaf surface area to the subplot surface area in the end a lai time series during an entire growing season were obtained for early and late planted winter wheat these lai time curves were showing the growth of each crop which were used for kcb curve evaluation samples for estimating soil texture and bulk density were collected by the means of a core sampler in four layers of soil from 0 to 80 cm table 3 the samples were transported to laboratory and soil texture was analyzed using the hydrometer method associated with textural triangle bouyoucos 1962 in order to determine bulk density the samples were dried out in oven at 105 c for 24 h and then weighed the ratio of dry mass of the soil sample to the volume of the sample was defined as bulk density buckman and brady 1960 irrigation time and depth and soil organic matter data were obtained from irrigation register office and soil information office of the hezarjolfa agro industry company respectively for both growing seasons all these data were utilized in swap simulation process 2 3 satellite and meteorological datasets in this study crop coefficients were calculated using landsat 7 etm tir and landsat 8 oli tirs imagery modis daily surface reflectance and land surface temperature lst products associated with digital elevation model dem meteorological data were obtained from the magsal station more details are presented in table 4 2 4 the fao recommended approach for kc and kcb estimations the kcb and kc curves could be plotted by possessing the lengths of the quadruple stages and also crop coefficients of initial kc cb ini middle kc cb mid and late season kc cb end of winter wheat maximum and minimum kc and kcb kc cb max and kc cb min respectively and the lengths of the stages were obtained from allen et al 1998 kc max and kcb max were modified using wind speed and minimum relative humidity eq 62 65 and 70 in fao 56 kc cb ini kc cb mid and kc cb end along with length of the growth stage are shown in table 5 2 5 the ratio approach for kc and kcb estimations in this method kc was directly calculated by dividing etp to et0 eq 1 and kcb by dividing tp to et0 eq 3 daily values of et0 were calculated using the penman monteith equation the ratio approach was conducted in two ways 1 simulating tp and etp using swap after assimilation of remotely sensed lai 2 calculating etp from the priestly taylor equation by using multispectral and thermal bands of landsat and modis in estimating daily net radiation 2 5 1 potential transpiration tp and potential evapotranspiration etp simulation using swap swap calculates tp and etp using the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 1981 4 et p δ λ w r n daily g p 1 air c air λ w e sat e a r air δ γ 1 r crop r air where rn daily is the daily net radiation j m 2 d 1 δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 λw is the latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 g is the soil heat flux j m 2 d 1 p1 is conversion factor equal to 86 400 s d 1 air is the air density kg m 3 cair is the heat capacity of moist air j kg 1 c 1 esat is the saturation vapor pressure kpa ea is the actual vapor pressure kpa γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 rcrop is the crop resistance s m 1 and rair is the air resistance s m 1 for the purpose of tp and etp estimation first the model calculates three parameters including potential evapotranspiration rate of a wet etw0 and dry etp0 canopy completely covering the soil and potential evaporation rate of a wet bare soil ep0 using the penman monteith equation these quantities are calculated by varying values for crop resistance crop height and albedo in the penman monteith equation when the canopy cover is wet rcrop is considered 0 when the canopy cover is dry assuming that the crop has no limitations for water uptake rcrop varies between 30 s d 1 for arable crops and 150 s d 1 for forest trees allen and pruitt 1986 allen et al 1989 when soil is wet with no canopy cover rcrop is 0 and the crop height is 0 1 cm albedo is considered 0 15 under bare soil condition and 0 23 when the ground is covered with crops then the potential evaporation ep and tp were separately calculated using etw0 etp0 and ep0 as follows and etp was obtained by addition of these two parameters 5 e p e p0 e κ gr lai 6 t p 1 w frac et p0 e p w i t h t p 0 where k gr is the extinction coefficient for global solar radiation 0 39 wfrac is the fraction of the day that the crop is wet and it is a function of etw0 and the daily amount of intercepted precipitation pi von hoyningen huene 1981 braden 1985 in this study in order to obtain accurate kc and kcb curves we had to either calibrate the model using numerous types of data series or assimilate satellite derived crop parameters into the model since we did not have access to field measured crop parameters for the whole growing seasons the data assimilation method was preferred eq 5 and eq 6 emphasize the importance of accurate lai values during a growing season in crop coefficient curve simulation an increase in lai causes a decrease in ep which consequently leads to higher values of tp mokhtari et al 2018 found that modis based savi had the best performance in lai estimation in the hezarjolfa fields they derived an empirical regression equation for winter wheat lai estimation using savi extracted from the modis daily surface reflectance product table 1 therefore in this study lai during the entire growing season was calculated by making use of the best fit regression equation presented in mokhtari et al 2018 and then assimilated into swap using a simple sequential updating algorithm vazifedoust et al 2009 therefore more accurate output data was expected 2 5 2 potential evapotranspiration etp calculation using the priestly taylor equation priesty taylor based etp calculation procedure was adapted from parodi and gabriel 2002 instructions and modified in this study the calculations were conducted by the means of landsat 7 and 8 imagery and modis lst product associated with meteorological data obtained from the magsal station eq 7 to eq 12 7 et p 1 26 δ δ γ r n rn was the subtraction of outgoing surface longwave rl and shortwave rs radiations from incoming surface longwave rl and shortwave rs radiations watt m 2 this parameter represents the amount of energy absorbed by the earth s surface δ and γ were calculated using air temperature from meteorological data and atmospheric pressure derived from dem respectively walter et al 2000 rs was calculated as suggested in hargreaves and samani 1982 rs is the fraction of rs which is reflected from the earth s surface and is determined using the broadband surface albedo α α was estimated using a weighted sum of landsat surface reflectance for each band waters et al 2002 rl and rl were obtained considering the stefan boltzman law which describes the radiance of an object in terms of its temperature to the fourth power they were respectively calculated using surface temperature obtained from satellite imagery and daily average air temperature from the magsal station in this study we chose to remove errors caused by converting instantaneous etp to daily etp by directly calculating daily etp from the priestly taylor equation so daily rl was required for this purpose therefore given that the lst derived from landsat thermal bands corresponds to the temperature at the time of image acquisition the modis lst product from both terra and aqua satellites were taken into account table 3 these products are composed of daytime and nighttime lsts which the average of them was assumed to be the daily lst of a pixel terra daytime and nighttime lsts are available at approximately 10 30 am and 10 30 pm local time respectively and aqua data are being acquired at 1 30 pm and 1 30 am for daytime and nighttime lsts respectively spatial resolution of modis imagery was relatively low 1000 m in the lst products and they were unsuitable for the medium sized farms of hezarjolfa therefore assuming that ndvi is constant in a day and has a strong relationship with daily average lst sun and kafatos 2007 the tsharp algorithm kustas et al 2003 agam et al 2007 was used for downscaling daily average modis lst to landsat spatial resolution so it could be used in fields with typical sizes the kc curves were obtained from the priestly taylor approach using following steps winter wheat farms were chosen and subsetted from the images 5 to 6 random polygons were drawn for each farm fig 2 and then time series of etp of each polygon was extracted the kc curves were obtained by dividing the etp time series derived from landsat imagery to et0 of the same days the calculated kc time series were linearly interpolated and smoothed in order to obtain daily kc curve 2 6 the vegetation indices approach for kc and kcb estimation the level of health and growth of a crop could be determined by calculating vis of a pixel over a crop field savi is one of the most widely used indices for estimating crop parameters this index is highly sensitive to variations of lai moran et al 1995 and the fraction of the ground which is covered by vegetation fc heilman et al 1982 jackson and huete 1991 the savi time series is an independent crop growth curve therefore make the extraction of the kcb curve from savi feasible bausch and neale 1987 neale et al 1990 savi has linear relationship with fc along the whole range of vegetation cover huete et al 1985 choudhury et al 1994 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 accordingly in this study eq 8 was used for fc estimation 8 fc savi savi min savi max savi min where savimin and savimax are the minimum and maximum values of savi for fc 0 and fc 1 respectively in this study irrigation and rain intervals were relatively long so the assumption of linear relationship between kcb and fc was true allen et al 2005a b allen et al 2005c paço et al 2012 if fc 0 kcb is minimum and if fc is a value slightly smaller than 1 kcb would be at its maximum level allen and pereira 2009 considering the aforementioned assumptions and the fact that kcb reaches its maximum level before the full ground cover fraction fcmax is occurred eq 9 would be reasonable 9 k cb min k cb max k cb max f c max f c where fcmax was considered 0 85 for winter wheat steduto et al 2012 mateos et al 2013 presented eqs 10a and 10b using the daily soil root zone water balance model in gonzalez dugo et al 2009 10a k c k c bare soil 1 k c bare soil k cb if k cb 1 10b k c 1 k c max 1 k cb max 1 k cb 1 if k cb 1 in order to make the method continuous when kcb is larger than 1 a straight line from 1 1 to kcb max kc max was indicative of the relationship between these two parameters allen et al 2005a showed that kc ini is determined as soon as crops are planted under the conditions of no vegetation cover or sparse vegetation cover therefore kc ini from fao 56 was used as an alternative to kc bare soil the calculation of kcb and kc was done using savi derived from landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli imagery determination of the locations of the polygons was similar to section 2 5 2 fig 2 in addition to landsat imagery the modis daily surface reflectance product table 3 was utilized in order to fill the time gaps between the landsat images the purest pixels were used for the kcb and kc calculations because these pixels showed more sensible trends in savi time series 2 7 net irrigation requirement calculation in this study nir was calculated using eq 11 daily and total nir resulted from each approach was investigated against the fao recommended approach 11 nir k c et 0 p e where pe is the effective rain mm the first term on the right side of eq 11 represents etp 3 results and discussions 3 1 field measurements 3 1 1 leaf area index the field measured lai time series of winter wheat was obtained and illustrated in fig 3 early planted winter wheat cp 4 lai was not available from the planting date until 3 march 2015 fig 3b due to the preparation of the measuring instruments and common bureaucracy problems therefore no lai data were obtained for the initial and half of the development stages the peak lai occurred in the middle of spring for both early and late planted winter wheat however early planted winter wheat reached the peak lai 15 days sooner than the late planted winter wheat and this was because of the earlier planting of the crop cp 2 winter wheat was planted on 17 november 2014 table 1 thus before the initial stage was over and the crop entered the development stage a cold weather hit the region and resulted in winter wheat dormancy and hindered its growth consequently the initial stage was prolonged until it revived from dormancy at the beginning of march where air temperature increased gradually on the other hand winter wheat in cp 4 was planted during the warmth of the beginning of autumn therefore due to proper temperature conditions a short initial stage was expected and it probably entered the middle stage before winter came 3 1 2 relationship between leaf area index and savi regardless of the planting dates the relationship between all the measured lai put together and savi extracted from modis and landsat imagery is illustrated in fig 4 the relationship was approximately linear on the one hand the kcb curves were calculated on the basis of linear equations eq 8 and eq 9 as a function of fc obtained from savi on the other hand lai bears a strong resemblance to fc nielsen et al 2012 ramírez garcía et al 2012 so subsequently it can be implied that the lai variability along the entire growing season had approximately linear relationship with kcb therefore the lai time series were taken into account for validation of the kcb curves the advantage of the landsat imagery to the images acquired by the modis sensor is their higher spatial resolution completely pure pixels were rarely available in the modis images but smaller farms could be studied using the images obtained by oli and etm sensors in this study due to mixed pixels of the modis images a lower coefficient of determination was yielded r2 of 0 765 in modis and 0 82 in landsat the purity of landsat pixels resulted in a wider range of savi variability during the whole growing season however the lai sampling dates did not always coincide with the landsat data acquisition dates in order to estimate lai corresponding to the date of the landsat images the field measured lai curves were interpolated using a weighted linear method viña et al 2011 inevitably this method caused dispersing of the points from the regression line in savi lai curve and consequently the root mean square error rmse slightly increased the regression line in landsat derived savi was more linear than modis derived savi especially in higher values of lai or in other words savi calculated from the modis images saturated at smaller values of lai about 2 5 m2 m 2 against 3 5 m2 m 2 therefore in spite of lower temporal resolution landsat was more efficient in detecting green vegetation cover during the entire growing season 3 2 kcb evaluation kcb curves of early and late planted winter wheat were obtained using the fao recommended vi and ratio approaches for an entire growing season fig 5 late planted winter wheat was planted in late autumn so quickly confronted the cold season after emergence and went into dormancy period therefore it had no time to fully grow up to complete the initial stage the initial stage prolonged until the weather gradually got warmer and the winter wheat dormancy came to an end fig 3a at this point the crop started to grow up quickly the initial stages in the vi and fao based kcb curves have considerable differences fig 5a the initial stage of late planted winter wheat lasted until late february fig 3a while the vi based kcb curve started to rise in late january but the fao recommended and swap approaches properly modeled the length of the initial stage the length of the initial stage in the swap approach was more convenient than the vi approach the curve line started from the value of 0 09 and then gradually entered the next stage in the fao recommended approach this stage was indicated by a horizontal line equal to 0 15 then suddenly and abnormally entered the development stage whereas in real world crops grow gradually the field measured lai curve was stating that the initial stage started from lai 0 fc 0 at the planting date until it germinated and gradually entered the development stage also when soil has no vegetation cover transpiration rate is equal to zero kcb 0 and when a crop grows tp increases subsequently gradual increase of kcb curve in spite of the vi derived kcb curves deficiencies they displayed this fact more properly compared to the other approaches the average value of et0 of the cold season was about 0 95 mm so it can be concluded that this period has no significant effects on nir final values therefore regarding the weaknesses of the vi approach in proper detection of an accurate date corresponding to the start of the development stage it simulated more logical trends in kcb variability at the initial stage of early planted winter wheat the development stage lasted until late april fig 3a all the approaches were successful in accurate simulation of the second stage considering the fact that kcb reaches its maximum value before the maximum vegetation cover occurs the middle stage was indicated by a horizontal line since the winter wheat middle stage occurred in a warm season higher values of et0 and also kcb in this stage was considered the maximum value of kcb along the entire growing season the accurate simulation of kcb was essential for generating more realistic estimates of nir swap derived kcb rose to the maximum value of 1 014 m2 m 2 which considering the well managed and full irrigation conditions of the hezarjolfa study fields no water and fertility stress this value was unreliable fao derived kcb indicated that the middle stage terminated at 10 june 2015 which according to the measured lai curve fig 3a the lai value corresponding to this date was about 1 m2 m 2 which was unreasonably low compared to lai of the beginning of the middle stage which was about 3 5 m2 m 2 so it can be concluded that the fao recommended approach poorly simulated the mid season stage in late planted winter wheat but in the vi approach the lai value at the beginning of the middle stage was approximately same as the lai value at the end of the middle stage about 3 8 m2 m 2 for landsat images and 3 5 m2 m 2 for modis images which was more logical then the middle stage was completed and the kcb curve declined gradually the yellowness of winter wheat at late season caused an increase in the reflectance of the red portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and reduced the near ir reflectance from the crop therefore savi at the end of the growing season decreased but was still larger than the savi value immediately after planting savi values of bare soil consequently kcb end was larger than kcb ini 0 whereas winter wheat harvesting was done when the crop color completely turned to yellow or in other words the crop was dead so tp should have been 0 kcb 0 hence none of the approaches was successful in considering this fact when winter wheat is planted early it would quickly pass the initial stage before the cold season comes and the crop starts the middle stage before dormancy the primary measured values of lai of early planted winter wheat was not available fig 3b therefore according to the early planted winter wheat kcb curves derived from the vi approach fig 5b it can be concluded that winter wheat planted in early autumn passed the initial and development stages in less than 30 days as soon as the winter wheat dormancy started the vi based kcb curves declined smoothly due to the slight decrease in leaf surface area caused by cold air temperature and no irrigation during the cold season then on 3 march 2015 where the first sample was collected the crop confronted the warmness of late winter and started to grow again so the crop growth was incremental until it reached its maximum on 22 april 2015 fig 3b therefore the vi approach performed best compared with other approaches generally according to the trends in the savi variations the middle stage was divided into two steps 1 before dormancy and 2 after dormancy the fao recommended approach couldn t detect the first step swap was significantly underestimating kcb in the period where lai was at its peak second part of the middle stage as it was also observed in late planted winter wheat the model assumed that the winter wheat harvest was done before the crop has completely yellowed so transpiration surface area was considered unusually high kcb end was a value larger than 0 in all the approaches so it did not match the reality as discussed above but in general according to lai time series fig 3a and b the vi approach performed best for the entire growing season in early and late planted winter wheat the length of time between planting date and full vegetation cover vary with climate latitude elevation above sea level crop variety and planting date allen et al 1998 both early and late planted winter wheat were planted under similar conditions of climate cultivar latitude and elevation except planting date therefore the significant difference between kcb curves of early and late planted winter wheat arose from the disparate planting dates overall it would be essential to obtain three growth curves including early mid and late planted curves for each crop in every region in principle fao recommended kcb curves had sudden changes from one growth stage to another while in reality crop grows gradually which its rate varies for different stages due to the fact that satellites continuously observe the changes to earth s surface and field measured lai curves the trends in kcb derived from savi was properly simulated but swap performed poorly and the reason was the mathematical equations which were developed despite our lack of knowledge about every process that affects et 3 3 kc evaluation kc curves of early and late planted winter wheat were obtained using the fao recommended vi and ratio approaches for an entire growing season and the results are illustrated in fig 6 swap was not able to properly simulate late season stage of late planted winter wheat for example the swap derived kc curve was persistently ascending for the whole growing season and the reduction in green vegetation was not considered because of the excessive values of tp at the end of the growing season also the values of the kc of early planted winter wheat started from 1 005 which was unusually for winter wheat in the vi approach landsat and modis derived almost similar trends for each crop because according to section 3 1 2 they both showed high accuracy in savi lai relationship the kc variations along the entire growing season were more logical and were in more compliance with real world vegetation cover variability compared with the fao recommended approach during initial stage under bare soil or partially bare soil conditions the main part of etp is composed of ep allen et al 1998 indicated that kc ini is a function of several atmosphere soil and management parameters such as evaporation power of the atmosphere et0 irrigation depth and frequency therefore calculation of kc ini requires irrigation and soil moisture parameters which cannot be obtained at a reasonable time and cost for a region hence inevitably kc ini and subsequently kc end in vi approach were limited to the values presented in fao 56 and therefore climate and precipitation conditions weren t considered in the model in order to solve this issue we used the priestly taylor equation for etp calculation to directly estimate kc from the ratio of etp to et0 in addition to the bands affected by green vegetation cover variability the priestly taylor approach made use of thermal and shortwave infrared swir bands and also air temperature for estimation of kc therefore more soil moisture and vegetation water content which highly absorb swir light and emit lower thermal energy and also the evaporation power of the atmosphere took part in the kc calculation kc ini at the initial stage of winter wheat was lower than the fao curve due to the small irrigation depths in both early and late planted winter wheat and low temperature and radiation conditions in the winter affecting late planted winter wheat considering the fact that lst and albedo time series was not used in swap kc ini was high in winter wheat fig 6 the advantage of this approach was using the thermal band for simulating the effect of temperature on crop growth process this effect was observable in winter wheat which confronted the dormancy period winter wheat requires average maximum temperature between 20 30 c to grow at optimum rate and prolonged periods below 5 c cause dormancy in winter wheat steduto et al 2012 in our study area air temperature went down below 5 c between 10 december 2014 and 19 february 2015 fig 7 so this period was considered as the dormancy period the dormancy period is also illustrated in early and late planted winter wheat diagrams with grey vertical dashes fig 6a and b therefore results showed that the effect of low temperature on wheat was more explicit in the priestly taylor approach the low temperature caused a decrease in vegetation greenness with delay thus the winter wheat dormancy period was observed with almost a month and a half delay in the vi approach where temperature rose up to about 12 c also the evaporative power of the atmosphere was not considered in the vi approach therefore the decrease in the kc curve was less severe than that of the priestly taylor approach during the dormancy when the weather is cold et is mainly depends on aerodynamic conditions and prevailing low temperature which highly limit the growth of a crop that is while solar radiation and vapor pressure significantly decrease so consequently the rate of et is reduced zhang et al 2004 the trends in etp in both early and late planted winter wheat during the entire growing season are illustrated in fig 8 as soon as winter wheat went into dormancy etp dropped down to approximately 0 mm d 1 and 0 35 mm d 1 in late and early planted winter wheat respectively similar results were found in shao et al 2011 and irmak et al 2015 thermal and swir portions of the radiation are highly influenced by water content of soil and crop so the values of albedo and lst decreased after each irrigation and rain events also albedo and lst are affected by many atmospheric conditions that cause their values to fluctuate during a year hence using the priestly taylor approach requires knowledge about different agricultural management practices corresponding to the crops under assessment and an agricultural background in order to better identify the trends in kc variability however this approach allowed us to extract more logical and realistic kc curves by augmenting the calculation process with more environmental parameters generally in spite of the weaknesses and limitations found in the satellite based methods the vi and priestly taylor approaches they can have better results rather than the fao recommended approach due to continuous observation of changes to earth s surface and atmosphere these approaches are also less costly and require less time to conduct compared to measuring techniques 3 4 net irrigation requirement calculation nir was calculated for winter wheat with two different planting dates on daily and season basis results are presented in table 6 swap had the highest nir for the entire growing season due to the overestimation of kc at the late season stage fig 6 so subsequently nir at this stage was also overestimated fig 9 due to higher spatial resolution and proper temporal resolution landsat imagery is suggested for crop growth curve extraction the landsat based vi approach compared with the fao recommended approach reduced nir of the entire growing season by 5 37 in late planted winter wheat nir resulted from the priestly taylor approach was reduced in both early and late planted winter wheat by 0 32 and 21 72 respectively the decrease in nir derived from the satellite based approaches in late planted winter wheat arose from the decrease in the lengths of the middle stages the irrigation systems were designed based on the kc curve of fao total irrigation depths during early and late planted winter wheat were 40 mm higher and 65 mm lower than fao derived nir respectively which considering the conditions of labor rainfall events and irrigation systems performance the irrigation management were well applied but regarding nir obtained from the priestly taylor approach irrigation depths or number of irrigation events in late planted winter wheat could be reduced in order to prevent water loss it should be noted that any increase in nir does not mean that the method is incorrect but optimizing water consumption is authentic if crop yield does not decrease also it is necessary to actualize kc curves of crops in order to provide adequate water during a whole growing season according to eq 1 etp was directly affected by et0 and kc fluctuations so consequently daily nir was a function of these two parameters kc at the initial and development stages of late planted winter wheat in the priestly taylor approach was lower compared to the other approaches fig 6a subsequently priestly taylor derived nir was the lowest followed by vi landsat vi modis fao and swap fig 9 after late planted winter wheat was planted air temperature started to decrease and a heavy irrigation was occurred therefore the need of the crop to water dropped below the no water requirement line as the warm season started air temperature increased after mid february fig 7 which is why heavy irrigation events are observed in this period in order to provide sufficient water for the crop however considering the priestly taylor curve and also adequate rainfall in the first half of the growing season the farm administration could remove the second to fourth irrigation events and reduce the depths of irrigation water in the second half in order to prevent water loss according to the priestly taylor curve the early planted winter wheat was relatively well irrigated maybe the removal of the second or the third irrigation event would not harm the crop due to the close intervals of rainfall events from about 10th march until 10th april the crop water requirement of early planted winter wheat declined and then as soon as it entered the middle stage in early april the curve started to increase until the end of the growing season the daily crop water requirements of both crops increased at the late season stage which was due to the increasing air temperature associated with low rainfall in principle calculating more accurate kc curves during an entire growing season especially in middle stage period has the most effect in water consumption optimization because on the one hand this stage usually occurs during the warm months and on the other hand kc is at its peak value so high values of etp are compounded during this period generally proper irrigation scheduling and determination of more accurate irrigation depth and frequency could be achieved by calculating kc using satellite imagery 4 conclusions the kc and kcb curves of early and late planted winter wheat were estimated using the fao recommended vi and ratio approaches the vi approach was conducted using modis and landsat imagery and the ratio approach was included the priestly taylor and swap approaches kcb was evaluated against field measured lai results showed that kcb calculated using vis extracted from satellite imagery was in more compliance with the trends in field measured lai rather than other approaches also it was indicated that planting date considerably affects the kcb and kc variations during an entire growing season the kc curves analysis showed that the priestly taylor approach yielded more logical and more realistic curves the vi approach reduced nir compared to the fao recommended approach by 5 37 in late planted winter wheat the priestly taylor approach also reduced nir in both late and early planted winter wheat 21 72 0 32 respectively taking the satellite imagery into account for modelling crop growth curves would improve irrigation scheduling in a farm and better management practices could be implemented on regional scales 
11366,traditional leafy vegetables tlvs are vegetables that were introduced in an area a long time ago where they adapted to local conditions and became part of the local culture in sub saharan africa the use of tlvs as a nutrient dense alternative food source to combat micronutrient deficiency of rural resource poor households rrphs has gained attention in debates on food and nutrition security however tlvs are underutilised because of lack of information on their yield response to water and fertiliser to better assess tlvs yield response to water stress the aquacrop model was calibrated using 2013 14 data and validated using 2014 15 data for three repeatedly harvested leafy vegetables amaranthus cruentus amaranth cleome gynandra spider flower and beta vulgaris swiss chard in pretoria south africa experiments were conducted during two consecutive seasons in which the selected leafy vegetables were subjected to two irrigation regimes well watered i30 and severe water stress i80

difference between transpiration water productivity wptr for c4 crops amaranth and spider flower and a c3 crop swiss chard wptr for the c4 crops ranged from 4 61 to 6 86 kg m 3 whereas for the c3 crop wptr ranged from 3 11 to 4 43 kg m 3 it is a challenge to simulate yield response of repeatedly harvested leafy vegetables because the model cannot run sequential harvests at one time therefore each harvest needs to be simulated separately making it cumbersome to design sustainable food production systems that are health driven and inclusive of rrphs we recommend that more vegetables including traditional vegetables should be included in the model database and that sequential harvesting be facilitated keywords crop modelling water productivity biomass evapotranspiration indigenous leafy vegetables 1 introduction globally the agricultural sector is utilising 70 of available fresh water projections indicate that the demand for water will increase due to population growth by the year 2050 more water will be required to produce highly nutritious food for more than 9 billion people ifpri 2016 furthermore climate change will increase temperature and carbon dioxide levels allan et al 2013 an increase in carbon dioxide from 380 to 550 ppm at 25 c has a benefit depending on crop species for c3 crops photosynthesis would increase by 38 which in turn will increase yield however for c4 crops an increase in co2 level may not show an increase in photosynthetic activity but an indirect increase in the efficiency of water use through reduction in stomatal conductance long et al 2006 several authors gido et al 2017 keatinge et al 2011 mabhaudhi et al 2016 uusiku et al 2010 averred that the current food system focus is on enhancing food security through the production of mainstream crops zea mays maize triticum species wheat sorghum bicolor sorghum oryza sativa rice hordeum vulgare barley and pennisetum glaucum millet under water scarcity these crops contribute significantly to dietary energy requirements however they are deficient in micronutrients iron and zinc and vitamin a globally two to three billion people suffer from micronutrient deficiency with sub saharan africa ssa accounting for approximately one billion ifpri 2016 keatinge et al 2011 focusing on cereal production as a solution to combat hunger will not abate the widespread occurrence of micronutrient

cabbage and tomato supported by large established consumer markets this has undervalued the nutritional component of some vegetables keatinge et al 2011 consuming nutrient dense vegetables is a first step in alleviating micronutrient deficiency the world health organisation recommends a vegetable intake of at least 400 g person 1 day 1 for a healthy and nutritious life a requirement that is not

water and fertiliser the threat of becoming extinct when collected from the wild or as weeds next to cropped land and limited insight into the factors affecting their nutritional content mavengahama et al 2013 these factors undermine the potential of tlvs to contribute to nutritional food security traditional leafy vegetables present advantages over alien vegetables their abundance in the wild or

keatinge et al 2011 mavengahama et al 2013 tata ngome et al 2017 uusiku et al 2010 these characteristics make tlvs ideal crops for rrphs in this paper we do not wish to undermine the essential role played by modern cereal crops in combating the energy deficiency of the food security quest following smith 2013 we advocate for a sustainable intensification of food production as the process of delivering safer nutritious food e g tonnes of cereals grams of protein and grams of micronutrients per unit of resource land area water fertiliser and agrochemicals there are approximately 500 million rrphs in ssa and asia who provide 80 of the food produced there ifpri 2016 however they are vulnerable to nutritional food insecurity because of low productivity and over reliance on a few selected vegetables that require high inputs such as water for irrigation and fertiliser introducing tlvs to rrphs as cultivated leafy vegetables have the potential of contributing significantly to the dietary diversification bello and walker 2017 under resource water and fertiliser constrained conditions experiments aimed at assessing the effect of two water stress levels on nutritional water productivity of amaranthus cruentus amaranth cleome gynandra spider flower and beta vulgaris swiss chard var ford hook giant were conducted in south africa during the 2013 14 and 2014 15 seasons we chose amaranth and spider flower because they are underutilised in southern africa but have a high potential of being cultivated as leafy vegetables whereas swiss chard was included as a reference crop because it is a widely accepted leafy vegetable that has been commercialised worldwide the challenge with field experiments is that they yield location specific results that may not be applicable to other locations with different climate and soils conducting experiments for evaluating the yield response of crops to different deficit irrigation strategies is time consuming laborious expensive and complicated therefore a combination of field experimentation and analysis based on crop water productivity models can be helpful to develop and assess different deficit irrigation strategies identify various environmental and management strategies separate evaporation and transpiration from evapotranspiration to assess beneficial use of water by crops and to aid decision making for improved irrigation and cultivation management mustafa et al 2017 to make the results of our field experiments more generic and applicable we selected the model aquacrop http www fao org aquacrop which was developed by the food and agriculture organisation to simulate yield responses of crops to water especially where water is limiting for crop production aquacrop has been utilised in many

to our knowledge the aquacrop model has not been calibrated and validated for spider flower and swiss chard therefore our main objective was to calibrate and validate the model for amaranth spider flower and swiss chard in this study we 1 parameterised aquacrop for selected leafy vegetables under two water stress levels 2 compared tlvs yield response with that of swiss chard and 3 considered the practice of harvesting these selected leafy vegetables repeatedly throughout the growing period which is currently absent as a management practice in aquacrop version 4 0 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site experimental setup irrigation water management and agronomic practices experiments were conducted under a rain shelter at the agricultural research council vegetable and ornamental plants arc vop roodeplaat pretoria 25 60 s 28 35 e 1168 m a s l in the gauteng province of south africa during the 2013 14 and 2014 15 summer seasons the rain shelter has a rain sensor that triggers an electric motor during a rainfall event and the shelter automatically covers the experimental field therefore the experiment experiences normal field conditions except when it is raining mabhaudhi et al 2014 long term climate data 1990 2015 shows a rainfall of approximately 650 mm per year on average concentrated in the summer october march january is the month with the highest average maximum temperature 30 c the experiment was a 3 2 factorial design with three crops amaranth spider flower and swiss chard and two irrigation water regimes i30 well watered and i80 severe water stress irrigation water regimes mean that crops were irrigated back to field capacity after 30 and 80 depletion of plant available water the maximum effective rooting depth 0 6 m for the selected leafy vegetables was determined using neutron probe readings we executed the experiment as a randomised complete block design and it was replicated three times three water samples were sent to the arc institute for soil climate and water to determine the quality salinity ds m 1 of irrigation water irrigation scheduling was based on irrigation water regimes using readings of the calibrated neutron water meter cpn 503 dr hydroprobe aluminium access tubes were installed in the middle of each plot to a depth of 1 m soil water content swc was measured twice a week at fixed depth increments of 0 2 m actual evapotranspiration eta mm was calculated using the soil water balance equation eq 1 1 eta i δw where i is the irrigation amount mm δw is the change in swc mm there was no deep percolation because the rain shelter kept rain out and irrigation was always to restore the top 0 6 m of the profile to field capacity the arc vop gene bank supplied seeds for amaranth and spider flower whereas swiss chard seedlings were procured amaranth and spider flower seeds were sown in seedling trays and covered with vermiculite which was used as a medium for seed germination the seedlings were planted in the field at an inter and intra row spacing of 0 3 m 0 3 m after 8 weeks the residual soil p 127 mg kg 1 and k 132 mg kg 1 values were very high therefore we decided only to apply limestone ammonium nitrate 28 n fertiliser at a recommended rate of 150 kg n ha 1 50 kg n ha 1 was applied at planting and the remaining 100 kg n ha 1 was applied as top dressing at 25 kg n ha 1 after each harvest during the growing period the crop management practices were similar for the 2013 14 and 2014 15 seasons 2 2 aquacrop model description aquacrop is a water driven model that simulates yield response to water i e water productivity prior to aquacrop the doorenbos and kassam 1979 approach was utilised to determine yield response to water for herbaceous and tree crops eq 2 which led to the evolution of the aquacrop model steduto et al 2009 the benefit of aquacrop is that 1 it separates eta into two separate components namely soil evaporation es and transpiration tr this means that it does not consider the non productive use of water es 2 aquacrop uses canopy cover cc instead of leaf area index lai which is directly related to water loss 3 yield is simulated as a function of the harvest index hi and final aboveground biomass eq 3 4 lastly it considers the normalised water productivity wp which is a conservative parameter that is applicable to different environmental and climatic conditions eq 4 foster et al 2017 mirsafi et al 2016 montoya et al 2016 tavakoli et al 2015 aquacrop consists of two types of parameters 1 conservative parameters which do not change with time management and location and 2 non conservative parameters that change with time management and location table 1 montoya et al 2016 parades et al 2015 in addition the model simulates swc in the root zone based on the water balance approach which makes it easy to understand irrigation management strategies tavakoli et al 2015 the model estimates water use based on four stress factors ks canopy expansion stomatal closure early canopy senescence and aeration stress mabhaudhi et al 2014 vanuytrecht et al 2014 in addition aquacrop calculates es and tr using eqs 5 and 6 details underlying

campbell scientific unites states of america logan ut to measure temperature and relative humidity converted into vapour pressure deficit l1 200 pyranometer campbell scientific unites states of america logan ut to measure solar radiation and the penman monteith equation to calculate reference evapotranspiration thereafter meteorological data collected were transmitted wirelessly and downloaded from a computer 2 the lai was measured every two weeks using an lai 2000 canopy analyser licor lincoln ne united states of america however aquacrop uses cc therefore eq 7 was used to convert lai to cc canopy cover values were used to determine maximum cc ccx and the period taken to reach ccx canopy extinction coefficient k values for selected leafy vegetables were obtained from archontoulis et al 2011 the stomatal conductance was measured at 10 25 35 45 55 and 75 days after planting using the sc 1 leaf porometer decagon devices pullman wa united states of america measurements were taken in the afternoon to ensure that the effect of water stress on conductance was captured stomatal conductivity results were used to determine crop sensitivity to water stress for the aquacrop model i e the severe water stressed treatment was used to determine whether selected leafy vegetables are moderately tolerant sensitive or extremely sensitive to water stress 7 cc 1 exp lai k x 100 3 the aboveground biomass agb g m 2 was harvested four times for amaranth and five times for spider flower and swiss chard to avoid border effects only data from the middle rows were utilised 1 8 m2 at every harvest the fresh mass was determined by weighing freshly harvested agb leaves and stems and above ground edible biomass ageb thereafter plant samples agb and ageb were oven dried at 75 c for 3 4 days to determine dry mass agb and ageb total dry biomass was calculated as the sum of subsequent harvests h1 h2 hn eq 8 was used to compute the harvest index hi planting dates

and water for textural class analysis soil physical characteristics sand silt and clay were determined using the united states department of agriculture taxonomic system https hrsl ba ars usda gov soilwater index htm the soil was classified as a sandy loam with 78 3 sand 5 4 silt 16 3 clay and a soil ph h2o of 6 87 field capacity and permanent wilting point were determined using the gravimetric

data collected daily meteorological data lai dry biomass dry raw leaves planting dates harvesting dates crop growth stages soil physical characteristics amount of irrigation water salinity of irrigation water and agronomic practices were used to create files for the aquacrop model climate crop irrigation and soil file vanuytrecht et al 2014 describe these files in details 2 4 model calibration and validation we used the data measured during the 2013 14 season for calibration of the model and the data of the 2014 15 for the validation of the model the calibration processes involved creating the crop file in aquacrop thereafter we entered the initial canopy cover cco determined from planting density ccx days to maturity gdd maximum rooting depth m as well as base and upper temperature c for crop development the model was able to calculate the planting density canopy growth coefficient cgc and the canopy decline coefficient cdc normalised water productivity was chosen based on crop species whether it was a c3 or c4 crop the model output was compared with the measured agb ageb eta cc swc and water productivity wp however aquacrop version 4 0 is not capable of running sequential harvests in a single run to simulate yield response of crops that are harvested several times during a season therefore each harvest was calibrated and validated separately by assuming that after each harvest approximately 1 2 of cc was left on the plot which becomes the cc0 for the subsequent harvest cycle to calibrate for water stress the canopy expansion stomatal closure and aeration stresses were adjusted until the measured data matched the simulated data early canopy senescence was not considered because leafy vegetables do not reach that stage 2 5 statistics after the calibration and validation of aquacrop model the goodness of fit between measured and simulated datasets were assessed using the root mean square error rmse eq 10 rmse standard deviation ratio rsr eq 11 the coefficient of determination r2 and relative deviation d eq 12 moriasi et al 2007 these were calculated using a microsoft excel spreadsheet 2016 10 rmse n 1 oi p 2 0 5 11 rsr rmse stdv 12 d oi pi oi where n is the number of observations oi is the observed value pi is the simulated value stdv is the observed standard deviation the rmse is a frequently used measure of the difference between values predicted by a model and values actually observed from the experiment that is being modelled rsr standardises the rmse using the stdv of the observed values it varies from zero indicating perfect simulation to a large positive value therefore the lower the rsr the better the model simulation performance the coefficient of determination r2 describes the degree of co linearity between simulated and measured data r2 ranges from zero to one with higher values indicating less error variance and values greater than 0 5 are acceptable lastly the relative deviation d assesses the deviation of the simulated values from the observed values the closer the d value to zero the better agreement between observed and simulated values araya et al 2016 2 6 water productivity and transpiration to evapotranspiration ratio water productivity was calculated as agb agb made up of several harvests kg ha 1 per actual evapotranspiration eta made up of several harvests mm and as agb agb made up of several harvests kg ha 1 per estimated transpiration trest made up of several harvests mm to assess the beneficial use of water trest trest was calculated using eq 13 13 trest trsim etsim x etames where trsim mm is the simulated transpiration by the aquacrop model etsim mm is the simulated evapotranspiration by the aquacrop model and etames mm is measured actual evapotranspiration trsim divided by etsim is the transpiration to evapotranspiration ratio t et 3 results 3 1 aquacrop model parameterisation table 1 presents cultivar non conservative and conservative parameters resulting from the calibration of aquacrop for the selected leafy vegetables non conservative parameters included planting density 6667 plants ha 1 maximum canopy cover amaranth 80 spider flower 90 swiss chard 90 effective rooting depth 0 8 m duration of period to recover after transplanting amaranth 64 gdd spider flower 64 gdd and swiss chard 30 gdd and duration of the biomass accumulation period amaranth 342 gdd spider flower 297 gdd and swiss chard 312 gdd these results show that for the c4 plant species amaranth and spider flower the duration of the period to recover after transplanting was longer than for the c3 species swiss chard 30 gdd however the duration of biomass accumulation to harvest was well above 300 gdd for amaranth and swiss chard whereas for spider flower it was 297 gdd this suggests that amaranth and swiss chard took longer to reach their ccx whereas spider flower was quicker by approximately 9 table a 1 presents other non conservative parameters for subsequent harvests during the calibration process measured planting spacing 0 3 m 0 3 m 111 111 plant ha 1 was entered in the crop file and aquacrop computed initial canopy cover cc0 1 67 surprisingly the model overestimated maximum canopy cover ccx but when the cc0 was reduced from 1 67 to 0 1 there was a good fit between measured ccx and simulated ccx table 3 and fig 1 this suggests that aquacrop requires a very small cc0 which raised major concerns during the calibration similarly neutron probe readings showed that the maximum rooting depth zr was 0 6 m however aquacrop underestimated canopy cover cc soil water content swc and evapotranspiration et when this value was used as an input previous experiments conducted at the arc vop showed that the zr for swiss chard was 0 8 m therefore 0 8 m was used and the model managed to simulate cc swc and et for selected leafy vegetables with acceptable accuracy the conservative parameters included the canopy growth coefficient cgc canopy decline coefficient cdc base and upper temperatures and thresholds lower and upper for canopy expansion and stomatal closure the normalised water productivity wp for amaranth and spider flower was 30 g m 2 whereas for swiss chard it was 16 g m 2 3 2 calibration of aquacrop for well watered and water stress conditions 3 2 1 canopy cover fig 1 shows simulated and measured canopy cover cc for the selected leafy vegetables during the 2013 14 growing season for the well watered i30 treatment maximum cc reached during the growing period was 90 for amaranth 96 for spider flower and 93 for swiss chard inducing water stress i80 treatment reduced cc to 62 for amaranth 68 for spider flower and 74 for swiss chard during the growing period the statistical indicators suggest that aquacrop was able to simulate cc with acceptable accuracy for these treatments the median root mean square error rmse was 0 48 highest rmse was 1 58 amaranth i80 rmse standard deviation ratio rsr ranged from 0 03 to 0 52 and the minimum r2 was 0 98 table 3 3 2 2 soil water content and evapotranspiration there was a strong agreement between measured and simulated soil water content swc table 3 the calibration results were as follows rmse ranged from 1 03 to 1 51 mm m 1 rsr from 0 10 to 0 15 and the minimum r2 was 0 87 these statistics suggest that aquacrop was calibrated satisfactorily fig 2 shows that water stress occurred at 12 days after transplanting dat for amaranth 15 dat for spider flower and 20 dat for swiss chard the swc simulated by the model followed the trend of observed values for swc table 4 presents estimated transpiration trest estimated soil evaporation eest measured actual evapotranspiration etames simulated et and transpiration to evapotranspiration ratio t et actual evapotranspiration ranged from 108 to 281 mm tlvs showed lower eta values by 23 for amaranth and 22 for spider flower relative to swiss chard for the i30 treatment the i80 treatment reduced eta by 54 for amaranth 32 for spider flower and 38 for swiss chard relative to the well watered treatments estimated transpiration test values varied between the selected leafy vegetables amaranth exhibited the lowest test values 50 107 mm whereas swiss chard showed the highest test values 105 174 mm amaranth and spider flower indicated lower t et 0 40 0 59 values than swiss chard 0 61 0 62 the goodness of fit between measured and simulated eta was as follows deviation d ranged between 0 11 and 0 07 and the median values were 2 01 mm for rmse 0 27 for rsr and 0 93 for r2 3 2 3 aboveground biomass and aboveground edible biomass for the i30 treatment the selected leafy vegetables showed similar measured total aboveground biomass agb made up of several harvests amaranth 6 13 t ha 1 spider flower 6 58 t ha 1 and swiss chard 6 39 t ha 1 inducing water stress reduced agb by approximately 44 for amaranth 33 for spider flower and 26 for swiss chard relative to the i30 table 5 the goodness of fit statistics showed that the model simulated agb with high accuracy table 5 the minimum rmse was 0 02 t ha 1 and the maximum was 0 06 t ha 1 the rsr ranged from 0 04 to 0 17 and the minimum r2 was 0 93 the harvest index hi for swiss chard was larger than that of amaranth and spider flower which is a consequence of the different plant structure of swiss chard that produces fewer stems and thus has a higher ratio of aboveground edible biomass ageb 3 2 4 water productivity table 6 presents measured and simulated values of actual evapotranspiration water productivity wpeta and transpiration water productivity wpt for the selected leafy vegetables measured wp values were closer to the simulated wp from the experiment relative deviation d ranged from 0 12 to 0 14 whereas the rmse ranged from 0 08 to 0 45 kg m 3 actual evapotranspiration wp for amaranth 2 56 3 18 kg m 3 and spider flower 2 68 2 71 kg m 3 was larger than for swiss chard 2 27 2 70 kg m 3 for amaranth and swiss chard increased water stress from i30 i80 improved wpetames and wptmes whereas for spider flower wpetames i30 2 71 kg m 3 and i80 2 68 kg m 3 remained the same and wptmes improved by approximately 46 our results indicate that by considering the productive use of water tr wptmes of c4 crops amaranth and spider flower improved by approximately 50 whereas wptmes of a c3 crop swiss chard improved by approximately 30 regardless of water stress treatment 3 3 validation of aquacrop for water stress and well watered conditions 3 3 1 canopy cover for the validation year 2014 15 more measured leaf area index lai data converted to cc were collected compared to the calibration year which resulted in more measured data points for cc fig 3 therefore the goodness of fit statistical results for cc validation was higher than for cc calibration table 3 they ranged from 0 94 to 1 65 for rmse 0 04 to 0 79 for rsr and the maximum r2 was 0 98 table 3 illustrates that aquacrop underestimated cc r2 0 64 for amaranth under water stress conditions generally cc was validated satisfactorily for the crops considered 3 3 2 soil water content and evapotranspiration fig 2 indicates that there was a clearer distinction between the i30 and i80 treatments for swc in the validation season compared to the calibration season this is attributed to improved irrigation management for the 2014 15 season compared with the 2013 14 season swiss chard swc for the i80 treatment showed a rapid decline throughout the season 2014 15 total irrigation amount for the 2013 14 season was 129 mm whereas for the 2014 15 season it was 90 mm fig 4 for the validation aquacrop was able to simulate swc for i30 and i80 very well indicating good model performance rmse 1 44 2 19 mm m

by 7 for amaranth 32 for spider flower and 3 for swiss chard than the values for the calibration table 5 increasing water stress from i30 to i80 reduced measured agb by approximately 53 for amaranth 44 for spider flower and 42 for swiss chard the harvest index hi ranged from 0 20 0 92 swiss chard showed a larger hi than amaranth and spider flower similarly the measured ageb ranged from 1 09 to 6 04 t ha 1 which was higher than the ageb for the calibration 1 80 4 15 t ha 1 aquacrop managed to simulate agb and ageb very well rmse 0 03 0 15 t h 1 rsr 0 07 0 79 r2 0 64 0 98 deviation 0 01 0 19 3

deviation ranged from 0 27 to 0 03 whereas the rmse ranged from 0 07 to 0 62 table 6 in contrast the validation results differed with the calibration results 1 increased water stress from i30 i80 reduced wpetames and wptmes and 2 for the well watered treatment i30 wpetames values were similar for amaranth 2 85 kg m 3 spider flower 2 46 kg m 3 and swiss chard 2 12 kg m 3 a similar trend was maintained whereby wptrmeas improved by approximately 50 for c4 crops amaranth and spider flower and by approximately 30 for a c3 crop swiss chard under water stress 4 discussion this was a first attempt to develop parameters for spider flower and swiss chard bello and walker 2017 parameterised aquacrop for amaranth however there were large discrepancies compared to the parameters we developed firstly their upper temperature was 30 c whereas ours was 40 c secondly their maximum effective rooting depth zr was 1 75 m and normalised water productivity wp was 28 t ha 1 2800 g m 2 these values are too high and might be suitable for deep rooted crops such as maize and sorghum zr for maize and sorghum are reported to range from 1 0 to 2 3 m and the wp for c4 crops ranges from 30 to 35 g m 2 in aquacrop araya et al 2016 paredes et al 2014 for the calibration our results showed a good fit between measured and simulated parameters canopy cover cc soil water content swc aboveground biomass agb and actual evapotranspiration eta when the initial canopy cover cc0 was reduced from 1 67 to 0 1 bello and walker 2017 proposed that aquacrop required a smaller value of cc0 because it might make provision for transplanting shock plants are inclined to grow slowly because they need to recover in this study transplanted seedlings were well irrigated to ensure crop establishment which might have assisted plants to develop a larger cc0 than the simulated cc0 bello and walker 2017 similarly the zr was increased from 0 60 to 0 80 m to improve the correspondence between simulated and measured parameters mabhaudhi et al 2014 reported similar findings whereby the actual observed zr for colocasia esculenta l schott taro was 0 45 m but a good match between measured and simulated values for biomass was found at 0 80 m the model is limited in parameters for leafy vegetables studies reported the normalised water productivity wp to range from 13 to 19 g m 2 for c3 crops malik et al 2017 montoya et al 2016 paredes et al 2015 razzaghi et al 2017 tavakoli et al 2015 and from 30 to 34 g m 2 for c4 crops araya et al 2016 bello and walker 2016 greaves and wang 2017 paredes et al 2014 these results show that the level of water stress affected cc development and eta aquacrop underestimated cc for the validation of amaranth and spider flower whereas a good fit was observed for swiss chard fig 3 and table 3 this observation is consistent with findings by bello and walker 2017 for amaranth where there was a poor match between measured and simulated cc rmse 20 82 r2 0 55 although our validation results showed better goodness of fit the contrast between bello and walker 2017 with our results might be that 1 they did not account for the fact that amaranth was harvested repeatedly during the growing period 2 the effective rooting depth was not measured but estimated from literature and 3 they used an empirical equation to convert leaf area index lai to cc which might have underestimated cc studies by greaves and wang 2017 pawar et al 2017 and razzaghi et al 2017 showed that aquacrop was capable of simulating cc for maize cabbage and potato but not under water stressed conditions the strength of aquacrop is its ability to separate eta into soil evaporation es and transpiration tr hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 which enables the assessment of productive tr and non productive es water use the t et ranged from 0 41 to 0 67 swiss chard 0 61 0 67 showed higher ratios than amaranth 0 45 0 50 and spider flower 0 40 0 59 table 3 the higher t et for swiss chard can be accounted for by the quicker development of foliage biomass which shades the soil from direct sunlight therefore reducing the non productive use of water es generally our results suggest that water loss was more through es than tr for amaranth 50 55 and spider flower 41 60 table 3 this contrast can be ascribed to the practice of harvesting biomass repeatedly we suspect that the model assumed that the soil was left bare for a longer period during each harvesting period resulting in higher es losses than tr a study conducted by giménez et al 2017 on soybean tested aquacrop under five water stress levels full irrigation rainfed and deficit irrigation at 1 flowering to grain filling 2 vegetative period and 3 during vegetative to grain filling and found that aquacrop gave smaller tr values and larger es values this is consistent with other studies bello and walker 2017 greaves and wang 2017 and katerji et al 2013 which reported similar findings for the calibration and validation of aquacrop a trend was observed whereby under the well watered treatment i30 the aboveground biomass agb productivity of the selected leafy vegetables was similar except for spider flower which showed a huge increase 9 82 t ha 1 for the validation season larger agb values were witnessed for the validation compared to the calibration season a validation test conducted by bello and walker 2017 on amaranth at three water stress levels full irrigation moderate irrigation and rainfed reported agb ranging from approximately 7 to 13 t ha 1 in contrast with our agb results table 5 the fully irrigated treatment 8 t ha 1 showed similar agb with their rainfed treatment 7 t ha 1 whereas their moderately irrigated treatment indicated the highest 13 t ha 1 agb information relating to the calibration and validation of aquacrop for spider flower and swiss chard agb is limited to this study these results should therefore be considered benchmarks in southern africa rural resource poor households consume amaranth and spider flower as food safety nets the softest stems and leaves are utilised mavengahama et al 2013 therefore it is crucial to consider the aboveground edible biomass ageb which ranged from 1 09 to 4 08 t ha 1 for amaranth and spider flower whereas for swiss chard it ranged from 3 41 to 6 04 t ha 1 swiss chard showed a higher proportion of ageb because its harvest index hi was larger than that of amaranth and spider flower table 5 the validation test under severe water stress i80 represents very dry conditions of which rural resource poor households grow their crops our results show that under water stressed conditions the ageb will decrease by approximately 59 for amaranth 63 for spider and 61 for swiss chard most studies bello and walker 2016 2017 mabhaudhi et al 2014 mirsafi et al 2016 montoya et al 2016 razzaghi et al 2017 conducted on aquacrop for selected crops saffron crocus sativus l tomato solanum lycopersicum pearl millet pennisetum glaucum amaranth amaranthus cruentus irish potato solanum tuberosum taro colocasia esculenta did not assess their wp in addition the majority of wp values reported by literature consider eta as a denominator which includes the non productive es use of water because of difficulty in separating es and tr our study tested aquacrop for its performance in simulating wpeta and wptr table 6 clear trends were absent between the calibration and validation of aquacrop for water productivity wpeta and wptr the calibration results showed that increasing water stress improved wpeta and wptr whereas the validation results revealed the opposite table 6 this can be explained by different meteorological conditions radiation reference evapotranspiration and vapour pressure deficit prevailing during the growing seasons table 2 for the validation season eta of the severe water stress treatment increased by 21 for amaranth 35 for spider flower and 11 for swiss chard table 4 relative to that of the previous season there was a clear distinction between wptr for the c4 crops amaranth and spider flower and the c3 crop swiss chard table 6 this concurs with renault and wallender 2000 van halsema and vincent 2012 and wenhold et al 2012 that c4 crops are more productive than c3 crops per unit of water used it is a challenge to compare wp from different locations because of varying climatic conditions methods used in calculating wp irrigation water management soil fertility management and vapour pressure deficit zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 other studies report the total amount of water applied whereas others report eta for example pawar et al 2017 reported wpeta of cabbage ranging from 50 to 69 kg ha 1 mm 1 however the denominator was total irrigation water applied wenhold et al 2012 benchmarked wpeta of leafy vegetables using a dataset agb per eta that was derived from different literature sources and reported values ranging from 2 to 90 kg ha 1 mm 1 for selected leafy vegetables the merit of our study is that datasets meteorological data crop evapotranspiration above ground biomass used to assess wp were collected from the same location 5 conclusions and recommendations this was the first attempt to calibrate and validate aquacrop for spider flower and swiss chard therefore these results should be considered the benchmark the goodness of fit statistics indicated that the model was calibrated and validated satisfactorily for selected parameters canopy cover soil water content actual evapotranspiration above ground biomass above ground edible biomass and water productivity under well watered and severe water stress conditions the model estimated water loss to be more by evaporation than transpiration which has been alluded by other studies bello and walker 2017 giménez et al 2017 greaves and wang 2017 katerji et al 2013 this may be caused by the practice of harvesting leafy vegetables repeatedly with the soil left bare for extended periods an innovative approach has been applied and tested to enable the simulation of multiple harvests however this approach is cumbersome when simulating large datasets because aquacrop currently can only run each harvest separately these results provide a foundation for further improving aquacrop in simulating yield responses of leafy vegetables and indeed many pasture crops that are also harvested several times in a growing season based on this study we recommend the following the impact of water stress should be validated by testing the calibrated model using datasets from other locations a crop module that can run multiple harvests in a single season s simulation should be included in aquacrop to find a good fit between measured and simulated canopy cover aquacrop required a much smaller initial canopy cover 0 1 compared to estimated canopy cover 1 67 from planting density bello and walker 2017 reported similar findings for the calibration of the model for amaranth we recommend that the food and agricultural organisation should fine tune the model to accept measured initial canopy cover for leafy vegetables the model has a tendency to under estimate soil water depletion which was alluded by mabhaudhi et al 2014 although this can be solved by increasing the effective rooting depth further research is needed to improve and adjust the model on simulating effective rooting depth currently the database of the model caters for mainstream crops limited vegetables solanum lycopersicum tomato and beta vulgaris but then as sugar beet and not as a leafy vegetable with conservative parameters are included in the database tomato contains minimal amounts of micronutrients and vitamins to construct sustainable food systems that are health focused and inclusive of rural resource poor households we recommend that more vegetables including traditional vegetables with conservative parameters are included in the model database we invite the modelling community to consider adding a module that can simulate nutritional content iron zinc and β carotene of crops this will enable crop modelling of nutritional yield and nutritional water productivity aquacrop predicts more evaporation than transpiration which seems unrealistic therefore the current method for partitioning actual evapotranspiration into evaporation and transpiration

11366,traditional leafy vegetables tlvs are vegetables that were introduced in an area a long time ago where they adapted to local conditions and became part of the local culture in sub saharan africa the use of tlvs as a nutrient dense alternative food source to combat micronutrient deficiency of rural resource poor households rrphs has gained attention in debates on food and nutrition security however tlvs are underutilised because of lack of information on their yield response to water and fertiliser to better assess tlvs yield response to water stress the aquacrop model was calibrated using 2013 14 data and validated using 2014 15 data for three repeatedly harvested leafy vegetables amaranthus cruentus amaranth cleome gynandra spider flower and beta vulgaris swiss chard in pretoria south africa experiments were conducted during two consecutive seasons in which the selected leafy vegetables were subjected to two irrigation regimes well watered i30 and severe water stress i80 measured parameters were canopy cover cc soil water content swc aboveground biomass agb actual evapotranspiration eta and water productivity wp statistical indicators root mean square error rmse rmse standard deviation ratio rsr r2 and relative deviation showed good fit between measured and simulated 0 60 r2 0 99 0 94 rmse 5 44 and 0 04 rsr 0 79 values for the well watered treatment however the fit was not as good for the water stressed treatment for cc swc eta and wp nevertheless the model simulated the selected parameters satisfactorily these results revealed that there was a clear difference between transpiration water productivity wptr for c4 crops amaranth and spider flower and a c3 crop swiss chard wptr for the c4 crops ranged from 4 61 to 6 86 kg m 3 whereas for the c3 crop wptr ranged from 3 11 to 4 43 kg m 3 it is a challenge to simulate yield response of repeatedly harvested leafy vegetables because the model cannot run sequential harvests at one time therefore each harvest needs to be simulated separately making it cumbersome to design sustainable food production systems that are health driven and inclusive of rrphs we recommend that more vegetables including traditional vegetables should be included in the model database and that sequential harvesting be facilitated keywords crop modelling water productivity biomass evapotranspiration indigenous leafy vegetables 1 introduction globally the agricultural sector is utilising 70 of available fresh water projections indicate that the demand for water will increase due to population growth by the year 2050 more water will be required to produce highly nutritious food for more than 9 billion people ifpri 2016 furthermore climate change will increase temperature and carbon dioxide levels allan et al 2013 an increase in carbon dioxide from 380 to 550 ppm at 25 c has a benefit depending on crop species for c3 crops photosynthesis would increase by 38 which in turn will increase yield however for c4 crops an increase in co2 level may not show an increase in photosynthetic activity but an indirect increase in the efficiency of water use through reduction in stomatal conductance long et al 2006 several authors gido et al 2017 keatinge et al 2011 mabhaudhi et al 2016 uusiku et al 2010 averred that the current food system focus is on enhancing food security through the production of mainstream crops zea mays maize triticum species wheat sorghum bicolor sorghum oryza sativa rice hordeum vulgare barley and pennisetum glaucum millet under water scarcity these crops contribute significantly to dietary energy requirements however they are deficient in micronutrients iron and zinc and vitamin a globally two to three billion people suffer from micronutrient deficiency with sub saharan africa ssa accounting for approximately one billion ifpri 2016 keatinge et al 2011 focusing on cereal production as a solution to combat hunger will not abate the widespread occurrence of micronutrient deficiency related diseases including stunted growth and impeded cognitive development there is a need to increase the consumption of vegetables as a strategic intervention for addressing micronutrient iron and zinc and vitamin a deficiency this can be done by constructing sustainable food systems that are inclusive of both rich and poor and that are highly nutritious climate smart and health focused bello and walker 2017 ifpri 2016 mabhaudhi et al 2016 tata ngome et al 2017 research funding has focused on the production of vegetables with low β carotene iron and zinc such as cabbage and tomato supported by large established consumer markets this has undervalued the nutritional component of some vegetables keatinge et al 2011 consuming nutrient dense vegetables is a first step in alleviating micronutrient deficiency the world health organisation recommends a vegetable intake of at least 400 g person 1 day 1 for a healthy and nutritious life a requirement that is not met by half of the countries in ssa tata ngome et al 2017 sub saharan africa has a wide variety of traditional leafy vegetables tlvs that are rich in vitamins carotenoids and other micronutrients iron zinc magnesium chivenge et al 2015 gido et al 2017 mabhaudhi et al 2016 tata ngome et al 2017 nyathi et al 2016 however tlvs are underutilised because of lack of information on their yield response to water and fertiliser the threat of becoming extinct when collected from the wild or as weeds next to cropped land and limited insight into the factors affecting their nutritional content mavengahama et al 2013 these factors undermine the potential of tlvs to contribute to nutritional food security traditional leafy vegetables present advantages over alien vegetables their abundance in the wild or next to cereal crops their high nutrient concentration iron zinc β carotene magnesium their drought tolerance their resistance to pests and diseases and the low need to apply water and fertiliser keatinge et al 2011 mavengahama et al 2013 tata ngome et al 2017 uusiku et al 2010 these characteristics make tlvs ideal crops for rrphs in this paper we do not wish to undermine the essential role played by modern cereal crops in combating the energy deficiency of the food security quest following smith 2013 we advocate for a sustainable intensification of food production as the process of delivering safer nutritious food e g tonnes of cereals grams of protein and grams of micronutrients per unit of resource land area water fertiliser and agrochemicals there are approximately 500 million rrphs in ssa and asia who provide 80 of the food produced there ifpri 2016 however they are vulnerable to nutritional food insecurity because of low productivity and over reliance on a few selected vegetables that require high inputs such as water for irrigation and fertiliser introducing tlvs to rrphs as cultivated leafy vegetables have the potential of contributing significantly to the dietary diversification bello and walker 2017 under resource water and fertiliser constrained conditions experiments aimed at assessing the effect of two water stress levels on nutritional water productivity of amaranthus cruentus amaranth cleome gynandra spider flower and beta vulgaris swiss chard var ford hook giant were conducted in south africa during the 2013 14 and 2014 15 seasons we chose amaranth and spider flower because they are underutilised in southern africa but have a high potential of being cultivated as leafy vegetables whereas swiss chard was included as a reference crop because it is a widely accepted leafy vegetable that has been commercialised worldwide the challenge with field experiments is that they yield location specific results that may not be applicable to other locations with different climate and soils conducting experiments for evaluating the yield response of crops to different deficit irrigation strategies is time consuming laborious expensive and complicated therefore a combination of field experimentation and analysis based on crop water productivity models can be helpful to develop and assess different deficit irrigation strategies identify various environmental and management strategies separate evaporation and transpiration from evapotranspiration to assess beneficial use of water by crops and to aid decision making for improved irrigation and cultivation management mustafa et al 2017 to make the results of our field experiments more generic and applicable we selected the model aquacrop http www fao org aquacrop which was developed by the food and agriculture organisation to simulate yield responses of crops to water especially where water is limiting for crop production aquacrop has been utilised in many studies e g abedinpour et al 2012 araya et al 2016 battisti et al 2017 bello and walker 2016 greaves and wang 2017 katerji et al 2013 mirsafi et al 2016 montoya et al 2016 mustafa et al 2017 paredes

saffron and solanum lycopersicum tomato to water stress bello and walker 2017 calibrated the model for amaranth however it was not clear how they accounted for repeatedly harvested leaves of amaranth to our knowledge the aquacrop model has not been calibrated and validated for spider flower and swiss chard therefore our main objective was to calibrate and validate the model for amaranth spider flower and swiss chard in this study we 1 parameterised aquacrop for selected leafy vegetables under two water stress levels 2 compared tlvs yield response with that of swiss chard and 3 considered the practice of harvesting these selected leafy vegetables repeatedly throughout the growing period which is currently absent as a management practice in aquacrop version 4 0 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site experimental setup irrigation water management and agronomic practices experiments were conducted under a rain shelter at the agricultural research council vegetable and ornamental plants arc vop roodeplaat pretoria 25 60 s 28 35 e 1168 m a s l in the gauteng province of south africa during the 2013 14 and 2014 15 summer seasons the rain shelter has a rain sensor that triggers an electric motor during a rainfall event and the shelter automatically covers the experimental field therefore the experiment experiences normal field conditions except when it is raining mabhaudhi et al 2014 long term climate data 1990 2015 shows a rainfall of approximately 650 mm per year on average concentrated in the summer october march january is the month with the highest average maximum temperature 30 c the experiment was a 3 2 factorial design with three crops amaranth spider flower and swiss chard and two irrigation water regimes i30 well watered and i80 severe water stress irrigation water regimes mean that crops were irrigated back to field capacity after 30 and 80 depletion of plant available water the maximum effective rooting depth 0 6 m for the selected leafy vegetables was determined using neutron probe readings we executed the experiment as a randomised complete block design and it was replicated three times three water samples were sent to the arc institute for soil climate and water to determine the quality salinity ds m 1 of irrigation water irrigation scheduling was based on irrigation water regimes using readings of the calibrated neutron water meter cpn 503 dr hydroprobe aluminium access tubes were installed in the middle of each plot to a depth of 1 m soil water content swc was measured twice a week at fixed depth increments of 0 2 m actual evapotranspiration eta mm was calculated using the soil water balance equation eq 1 1 eta i δw where i is the irrigation amount mm δw is the change in swc mm there was no deep percolation because the rain shelter kept rain out and irrigation was always to restore the top 0 6 m of the profile to field capacity the arc vop gene bank supplied seeds for amaranth and spider flower whereas swiss chard seedlings were procured amaranth and spider flower seeds were sown in seedling trays and covered with vermiculite which was used as a medium for seed germination the seedlings were planted in the field at an inter and intra row spacing of 0 3 m 0 3 m after 8 weeks the residual soil p 127 mg kg 1 and k 132 mg kg 1 values were very high therefore we decided only to apply limestone ammonium nitrate 28 n fertiliser at a recommended rate of 150 kg n ha 1 50 kg n ha 1 was applied at planting and the remaining 100 kg n ha 1 was applied as top dressing at 25 kg n ha 1 after each harvest during the growing period the crop management practices were similar for the 2013 14 and 2014 15 seasons 2 2 aquacrop model description aquacrop is a water driven model that simulates yield response to water i e water productivity prior to aquacrop the doorenbos and kassam 1979 approach was utilised to determine yield response to water for herbaceous and tree crops eq 2 which led to the evolution of the aquacrop model steduto et al 2009 the benefit of aquacrop is that 1 it separates eta into two separate components namely soil evaporation es and transpiration tr this means that it does not consider the non productive use of water es 2 aquacrop uses canopy cover cc instead of leaf area index lai which is directly related to water loss 3 yield is simulated as a function of the harvest index hi and final aboveground biomass eq 3 4 lastly it considers the normalised water productivity wp which is a conservative parameter that is applicable to different environmental and climatic conditions eq 4 foster et al 2017 mirsafi et al 2016 montoya et al 2016 tavakoli et al 2015 aquacrop consists of two types of parameters 1 conservative parameters which do not change with time management and location and 2 non conservative parameters that change with time management and location table 1 montoya et al 2016 parades et al 2015 in addition the model simulates swc in the root zone based on the water balance approach which makes it easy to understand irrigation management strategies tavakoli et al 2015 the model estimates water use based on four stress factors ks

into aquacrop model 1 daily meteorological data were obtained from an automatic weather station located 5 m away from the rain shelter meteorological variables included minimum and maximum temperatures oc total radiation mj m 2 day 1 vapour pressure deficit kpa wind speed m s 1 and reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 table 2 the automatic weather station uses the cs 500 vaisala probe campbell scientific unites states of america logan ut to measure temperature and relative humidity converted into vapour pressure deficit l1 200 pyranometer campbell scientific unites states of america logan ut to measure solar radiation and the penman monteith equation to calculate reference evapotranspiration thereafter meteorological data collected were transmitted wirelessly and downloaded from a computer 2 the lai was measured every two weeks using an lai 2000 canopy analyser licor lincoln ne united states of america however aquacrop uses cc therefore eq 7 was used to convert lai to cc canopy cover values were used to determine maximum cc ccx and the period taken to reach ccx canopy extinction coefficient k values for selected leafy vegetables were obtained from archontoulis et al 2011 the stomatal conductance was measured at 10 25 35 45 55 and 75 days after planting using the sc 1 leaf porometer decagon devices pullman wa united states of america measurements were taken in the afternoon to ensure that the effect of water stress on conductance was captured stomatal conductivity results were used to determine crop sensitivity to water stress for the aquacrop model i e the severe water stressed treatment was used to determine whether selected leafy vegetables are moderately tolerant sensitive or extremely sensitive to water stress 7 cc 1 exp lai k x 100 3 the aboveground biomass agb g m 2 was harvested four times for amaranth and five times for spider flower and swiss chard to avoid border effects only data from the middle rows were utilised 1 8 m2 at every harvest the fresh mass was determined by weighing freshly harvested agb leaves and stems and above ground edible biomass ageb thereafter plant samples agb and ageb were oven dried at 75 c for 3 4 days to determine dry mass agb and ageb total dry biomass was calculated as the sum of subsequent harvests h1 h2 hn eq 8 was used to compute the harvest index hi planting dates

and water for textural class analysis soil physical characteristics sand silt and clay were determined using the united states department of agriculture taxonomic system https hrsl ba ars usda gov soilwater index htm the soil was classified as a sandy loam with 78 3 sand 5 4 silt 16 3 clay and a soil ph h2o of 6 87 field capacity and permanent wilting point were determined using the gravimetric method the field capacity fc was 168 mm m 1 permanent wilting point pwp was 37 mm m 1 saturated hydraulic conductivity ks was 840 mm day 1 and the average bulk density of the soil was 1 5 g cm 3 the data collected daily meteorological data lai dry biomass dry raw leaves planting dates harvesting dates crop growth stages soil physical characteristics amount of irrigation water salinity of irrigation water and agronomic practices were used to create files for the aquacrop model climate crop irrigation and soil file vanuytrecht et al 2014 describe these files in details 2 4 model calibration and validation we used the data measured during the 2013 14 season for calibration of the model and the data of the 2014 15 for the validation of the model the calibration processes involved creating the crop file in aquacrop thereafter we entered the initial canopy cover cco determined from planting density ccx days to maturity gdd maximum rooting depth m as well as base and upper temperature c for crop development the model was able to calculate the planting density canopy growth coefficient cgc and the canopy decline coefficient cdc normalised water productivity was chosen based on crop species whether it was a c3 or c4 crop the model output was compared with the measured agb ageb eta cc swc and water productivity wp however aquacrop version 4 0 is not capable of running sequential harvests in a single run to simulate yield response of crops that are harvested several times during a season therefore each harvest was calibrated and validated separately by assuming that after each harvest approximately 1 2 of cc was left on the plot which becomes the cc0 for the subsequent harvest cycle to calibrate for water stress the canopy expansion stomatal closure and aeration stresses were adjusted until the measured data matched the simulated data early canopy senescence was not considered because leafy vegetables do not reach that stage 2 5 statistics after the calibration and validation of aquacrop model the goodness of fit between measured and simulated datasets were assessed using the root mean square error rmse eq 10 rmse standard deviation ratio rsr eq 11 the coefficient of determination r2 and relative deviation d eq 12 moriasi et al 2007 these were calculated using a microsoft excel spreadsheet 2016 10 rmse n 1 oi p 2 0 5 11 rsr rmse stdv 12 d oi pi oi where n is the number of observations oi is the observed value pi is the simulated value stdv is the observed standard deviation the rmse is a frequently used measure of the difference between values predicted by a model and values actually observed from the experiment that is being modelled rsr standardises the rmse using the stdv of the observed values it varies from zero indicating perfect simulation to a large positive value therefore the lower the rsr the better the model simulation performance the coefficient of determination r2 describes the degree of co linearity between simulated and measured data r2 ranges from zero to one with higher values indicating less error variance and values greater than 0 5 are acceptable lastly the relative deviation d assesses the deviation of the simulated values from the observed values the closer the d value to zero the better agreement between observed and simulated values araya et al 2016 2 6 water productivity and transpiration to evapotranspiration ratio water productivity was calculated as agb agb made up of several harvests kg ha 1 per actual evapotranspiration eta made up of several harvests mm and as agb agb made up of several harvests kg ha 1 per estimated transpiration trest made up of several harvests mm to assess the beneficial use of water trest trest was calculated using eq 13 13 trest trsim etsim x etames where trsim mm is the simulated transpiration by the aquacrop model etsim mm is the simulated evapotranspiration by the aquacrop model and etames mm is measured actual evapotranspiration trsim divided by etsim is the transpiration to evapotranspiration ratio t et 3 results 3 1 aquacrop model parameterisation table 1 presents cultivar non conservative and conservative parameters resulting from the calibration of aquacrop for the selected leafy vegetables non conservative parameters included planting density 6667 plants ha 1 maximum canopy cover amaranth 80 spider flower 90 swiss chard 90 effective rooting depth 0 8 m duration of period to recover after transplanting amaranth 64 gdd spider flower 64 gdd and swiss chard 30 gdd and duration of the biomass accumulation period amaranth 342 gdd spider flower 297 gdd and swiss chard 312 gdd these results show that for the c4 plant species amaranth and spider flower the duration of the period to recover after transplanting was longer than for the c3 species swiss chard 30 gdd however the duration of biomass accumulation to harvest was well above 300 gdd for amaranth and swiss chard whereas for spider flower it was 297 gdd this suggests that amaranth and swiss chard took longer to reach their ccx whereas spider flower was quicker by approximately 9 table a 1 presents other non conservative parameters for subsequent harvests during the calibration process measured planting spacing 0 3 m 0 3 m 111 111 plant ha 1 was entered in the crop file and aquacrop computed initial canopy cover cc0 1 67 surprisingly the model overestimated maximum canopy cover ccx but when the cc0 was reduced from 1 67 to 0 1 there was a good fit between measured ccx and simulated ccx table 3 and fig 1 this suggests that aquacrop requires a very small cc0 which raised major concerns during the calibration similarly neutron probe readings showed that the maximum rooting depth zr was 0 6 m however aquacrop underestimated canopy cover cc soil water content swc and evapotranspiration et when this value was used as an input previous experiments conducted at the arc vop showed that the zr for swiss chard was 0 8 m therefore 0 8 m was used and the model managed to simulate cc swc and et for selected leafy vegetables with acceptable accuracy the conservative parameters included the canopy growth coefficient cgc canopy decline coefficient cdc base and upper temperatures and thresholds lower and upper for canopy expansion and stomatal closure the normalised water productivity wp for amaranth and spider flower was 30 g m 2 whereas for swiss chard it was 16 g m 2 3 2 calibration of aquacrop for well watered and water stress conditions 3 2 1 canopy cover fig 1 shows simulated and measured canopy cover cc for the selected leafy vegetables during the 2013 14 growing season for the well watered i30 treatment maximum cc reached during the growing period was 90 for amaranth 96 for spider flower and 93 for swiss chard inducing water stress i80 treatment reduced cc to 62 for amaranth 68 for spider flower and 74 for swiss chard during the growing period the statistical indicators suggest that aquacrop was able to simulate cc with acceptable accuracy for these treatments the median root mean square error rmse was 0 48 highest rmse was 1 58 amaranth i80 rmse standard deviation ratio rsr ranged from 0 03 to 0 52 and the minimum r2 was 0 98 table 3 3 2 2 soil water content and evapotranspiration there was a strong agreement between measured and simulated soil water content swc table 3 the calibration results were as follows rmse ranged from 1 03 to 1 51 mm m 1 rsr from 0 10 to 0 15 and the minimum r2 was 0 87 these statistics suggest that aquacrop was calibrated satisfactorily fig 2 shows that water stress occurred at 12 days after transplanting dat for amaranth 15 dat for spider flower and 20 dat for swiss chard the swc simulated by the model followed the trend of observed values for swc table 4 presents estimated transpiration trest estimated soil evaporation eest measured actual evapotranspiration etames simulated et and transpiration to evapotranspiration ratio t et actual evapotranspiration ranged from 108 to 281 mm tlvs showed lower eta values by 23 for amaranth and 22 for spider flower relative to swiss chard for the i30 treatment the i80 treatment reduced eta by 54 for amaranth 32 for spider flower and 38 for swiss chard relative to the well watered treatments estimated transpiration test values varied between the selected leafy vegetables amaranth exhibited the lowest test values 50 107 mm whereas swiss chard showed the highest test values 105 174 mm amaranth and spider flower indicated lower t et 0 40 0 59 values than swiss chard 0 61 0 62 the goodness of fit between measured and simulated eta was as follows deviation d ranged between 0 11 and 0 07 and the median values were 2 01 mm for rmse 0 27 for rsr and 0 93 for r2 3 2 3 aboveground biomass and aboveground edible biomass for the i30 treatment the selected leafy vegetables showed similar measured total aboveground biomass agb made up of several harvests amaranth 6 13 t ha 1 spider flower 6 58 t ha 1 and swiss chard 6 39 t ha 1 inducing water stress reduced agb by approximately 44 for amaranth 33 for spider flower and 26 for swiss chard relative to the i30 table 5 the goodness of fit statistics showed that the model simulated agb with high accuracy table 5 the minimum rmse was 0 02 t ha 1 and the maximum was 0 06 t ha 1 the rsr ranged from 0 04 to 0 17 and the minimum r2 was 0 93 the harvest index hi for swiss chard was larger than that of amaranth and spider flower which is a consequence of the different plant structure of swiss chard that produces fewer stems and thus has a higher ratio of aboveground edible biomass ageb 3 2 4 water productivity table 6 presents measured and simulated values of actual evapotranspiration water productivity wpeta and transpiration water productivity wpt for the selected leafy vegetables measured wp values were closer to the simulated wp from the experiment relative deviation d ranged from 0 12 to 0 14 whereas the rmse ranged from 0 08 to 0 45 kg m 3 actual evapotranspiration wp for amaranth 2 56 3 18 kg m 3 and spider flower 2 68 2 71 kg m 3 was larger than for swiss chard 2 27 2 70 kg m 3 for amaranth and swiss chard increased water stress from i30 i80 improved wpetames and wptmes whereas for spider flower wpetames i30 2 71 kg m 3 and i80 2 68 kg m 3 remained the same and wptmes improved by approximately 46 our results indicate that by considering the productive use of water tr wptmes of c4 crops amaranth and spider flower improved by approximately 50 whereas wptmes of a c3 crop swiss chard improved by approximately 30 regardless of water stress treatment 3 3 validation of aquacrop for water stress and well watered conditions 3 3 1 canopy cover for the validation year 2014 15 more measured leaf area index lai data converted to cc were collected compared to the calibration year which resulted in more measured data points for cc fig 3 therefore the goodness of fit statistical results for cc validation was higher than for cc calibration table 3 they ranged from 0 94 to 1 65 for rmse 0 04 to 0 79 for rsr and the maximum r2 was 0 98 table 3 illustrates that aquacrop underestimated cc r2 0 64 for amaranth under water stress conditions generally cc was validated satisfactorily for the crops considered 3 3 2 soil water content and evapotranspiration fig 2 indicates that there was a clearer distinction between the i30 and i80 treatments for swc in the validation season compared to the calibration season this is attributed to improved irrigation management for the 2014 15 season compared with the 2013 14 season swiss chard swc for the i80 treatment showed a rapid decline throughout the season 2014 15 total irrigation amount for the 2013 14 season was 129 mm whereas for the 2014 15 season it was 90 mm fig 4 for the validation aquacrop was able to simulate swc for i30 and i80 very well indicating good model performance rmse 1 44 2 19 mm m

by 7 for amaranth 32 for spider flower and 3 for swiss chard than the values for the calibration table 5 increasing water stress from i30 to i80 reduced measured agb by approximately 53 for amaranth 44 for spider flower and 42 for swiss chard the harvest index hi ranged from 0 20 0 92 swiss chard showed a larger hi than amaranth and spider flower similarly the measured ageb ranged from 1 09 to 6 04 t ha 1 which was higher than the ageb for the calibration 1 80 4 15 t ha 1 aquacrop managed to simulate agb and ageb very well rmse 0 03 0 15 t h 1 rsr 0 07 0 79 r2 0 64 0 98 deviation 0 01 0 19 3

deviation ranged from 0 27 to 0 03 whereas the rmse ranged from 0 07 to 0 62 table 6 in contrast the validation results differed with the calibration results 1 increased water stress from i30 i80 reduced wpetames and wptmes and 2 for the well watered treatment i30 wpetames values were similar for amaranth 2 85 kg m 3 spider flower 2 46 kg m 3 and swiss chard 2 12 kg m 3 a similar trend was maintained whereby wptrmeas improved by approximately 50 for c4 crops amaranth and spider flower and by approximately 30 for a c3 crop swiss chard under water stress 4 discussion this was a first attempt to develop parameters for spider flower and swiss chard bello and walker 2017 parameterised aquacrop for amaranth however there were large discrepancies compared to the parameters we developed firstly their upper temperature was 30 c whereas ours was 40 c secondly their maximum effective rooting depth zr was 1 75 m and normalised water productivity wp was 28 t ha 1 2800 g m 2 these values are too high and might be suitable for deep rooted crops such as maize and sorghum zr for maize and sorghum are reported to range from 1 0 to 2 3 m and the wp for c4 crops ranges from 30 to 35 g m 2 in aquacrop araya et al 2016 paredes et al 2014 for the calibration our results showed a good fit between measured and simulated parameters canopy cover cc soil water content swc aboveground biomass agb and actual evapotranspiration eta when the initial canopy cover cc0 was reduced from 1 67 to 0 1 bello and walker 2017 proposed that aquacrop required a smaller value of cc0 because it might make provision for transplanting shock plants are inclined to grow slowly because they need to recover in this study transplanted seedlings were well irrigated to ensure crop establishment which might have assisted plants to develop a larger cc0 than the simulated cc0 bello and walker 2017 similarly the zr was increased from 0 60 to 0 80 m to improve the correspondence between simulated and measured parameters mabhaudhi et al 2014 reported similar findings whereby the actual observed zr for colocasia esculenta l schott taro was 0 45 m but a good match between measured and simulated values for biomass was found at 0 80 m the model is limited in parameters for leafy vegetables studies reported the normalised water productivity wp to range from 13 to 19 g m 2 for c3 crops malik et al 2017 montoya et al 2016 paredes et al 2015 razzaghi et al 2017 tavakoli et al 2015 and from 30 to 34 g m 2 for c4 crops araya et al 2016 bello and walker 2016 greaves and wang 2017 paredes et al 2014 these results show that the level of water stress affected cc development and eta aquacrop underestimated cc for the validation of amaranth and spider flower whereas a good fit was observed for swiss chard fig 3 and table 3 this observation is consistent with findings by bello and walker 2017 for amaranth where there was a poor match between measured and simulated cc rmse 20 82 r2 0 55 although our validation results showed better goodness of fit the contrast between bello and walker 2017 with our results might be that 1 they did not account for the fact that amaranth was harvested repeatedly during the growing period 2 the effective rooting depth was not measured but estimated from literature and 3 they used an empirical equation to convert leaf area index lai to cc which might have underestimated cc studies by greaves and wang 2017 pawar et al 2017 and razzaghi et al 2017 showed that aquacrop was capable of simulating cc for maize cabbage and potato but not under water stressed conditions the strength of aquacrop is its ability to separate eta into soil evaporation es and transpiration tr hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 which enables the assessment of productive tr and non productive es water use the t et ranged from 0 41 to 0 67 swiss chard 0 61 0 67 showed higher ratios than amaranth 0 45 0 50 and spider flower 0 40 0 59 table 3 the higher t et for swiss chard can be accounted for by the quicker development of foliage biomass which shades the soil from direct sunlight therefore reducing the non productive use of water es generally our results suggest that water loss was more through es than tr for amaranth 50 55 and spider flower 41 60 table 3 this contrast can be ascribed to the practice of harvesting biomass repeatedly we suspect that the model assumed that the soil was left bare for a longer period during each harvesting period resulting in higher es losses than tr a study conducted by giménez et al 2017 on soybean tested aquacrop under five water stress levels full irrigation rainfed and deficit irrigation at 1 flowering to grain filling 2 vegetative period and 3 during vegetative to grain filling and found that aquacrop gave smaller tr values and larger es values this is consistent with other studies bello and walker 2017 greaves and wang 2017 and katerji et al 2013 which reported similar findings for the calibration and validation of aquacrop a trend was observed whereby under the well watered treatment i30 the aboveground biomass agb productivity of the selected leafy vegetables was similar except for spider flower which showed a huge increase 9 82 t ha 1 for the validation season larger agb values were witnessed for the validation compared to the calibration season a validation test conducted by bello and walker 2017 on amaranth at three water stress levels full irrigation moderate irrigation and rainfed reported agb ranging from approximately 7 to 13 t ha 1 in contrast with our agb results table 5 the fully irrigated treatment 8 t ha 1 showed similar agb with their rainfed treatment 7 t ha 1 whereas their moderately irrigated treatment indicated the highest 13 t ha 1 agb information relating to the calibration and validation of aquacrop for spider flower and swiss chard agb is limited to this study these results should therefore be considered benchmarks in southern africa rural resource poor households consume amaranth and spider flower as food safety nets the softest stems and leaves are utilised mavengahama et al 2013 therefore it is crucial to consider the aboveground edible biomass ageb which ranged from 1 09 to 4 08 t ha 1 for amaranth and spider flower whereas for swiss chard it ranged from 3 41 to 6 04 t ha 1 swiss chard showed a higher proportion of ageb because its harvest index hi was larger than that of amaranth and spider flower table 5 the validation test under severe water stress i80 represents very dry conditions of which rural resource poor households grow their crops our results show that under water stressed conditions the ageb will decrease by approximately 59 for amaranth 63 for spider and 61 for swiss chard most studies bello and walker 2016 2017 mabhaudhi et al 2014 mirsafi et al 2016 montoya et al 2016 razzaghi et al 2017 conducted on aquacrop for selected crops saffron crocus sativus l tomato solanum lycopersicum pearl millet pennisetum glaucum amaranth amaranthus cruentus irish potato solanum tuberosum taro colocasia esculenta did not assess their wp in addition the majority of wp values reported by literature consider eta as a denominator which includes the non productive es use of water because of difficulty in separating es and tr our study tested aquacrop for its performance in simulating wpeta and wptr table 6 clear trends were absent between the calibration and validation of aquacrop for water productivity wpeta and wptr the calibration results showed that increasing water stress improved wpeta and wptr whereas the validation results revealed the opposite table 6 this can be explained by different meteorological conditions radiation reference evapotranspiration and vapour pressure deficit prevailing during the growing seasons table 2 for the validation season eta of the severe water stress treatment increased by 21 for amaranth 35 for spider flower and 11 for swiss chard table 4 relative to that of the previous season there was a clear distinction between wptr for the c4 crops amaranth and spider flower and the c3 crop swiss chard table 6 this concurs with renault and wallender 2000 van halsema and vincent 2012 and wenhold et al 2012 that c4 crops are more productive than c3 crops per unit of water used it is a challenge to compare wp from different locations because of varying climatic conditions methods used in calculating wp irrigation water management soil fertility management and vapour pressure deficit zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 other studies report the total amount of water applied whereas others report eta for example pawar et al 2017 reported wpeta of cabbage ranging from 50 to 69 kg ha 1 mm 1 however the denominator was total irrigation water applied wenhold et al 2012 benchmarked wpeta of leafy vegetables using a dataset agb per eta that was derived from different literature sources and reported values ranging from 2 to 90 kg ha 1 mm 1 for selected leafy vegetables the merit of our study is that datasets meteorological data crop evapotranspiration above ground biomass used to assess wp were collected from the same location 5 conclusions and recommendations this was the first attempt to calibrate and validate aquacrop for spider flower and swiss chard therefore these results should be considered the benchmark the goodness of fit statistics indicated that the model was calibrated and validated satisfactorily for selected parameters canopy cover soil water content actual evapotranspiration above ground biomass above ground edible biomass and water productivity under well watered and severe water stress conditions the model estimated water loss to be more by evaporation than transpiration which has been alluded by other studies bello and walker 2017 giménez et al 2017 greaves and wang 2017 katerji et al 2013 this may be caused by the practice of harvesting leafy vegetables repeatedly with the soil left bare for extended periods an innovative approach has been applied and tested to enable the simulation of multiple harvests however this approach is cumbersome when simulating large datasets because aquacrop currently can only run each harvest separately these results provide a foundation for further improving aquacrop in simulating yield responses of leafy vegetables and indeed many pasture crops that are also harvested several times in a growing season based on this study we recommend the following the impact of water stress should be validated by testing the calibrated model using datasets from other locations a crop module that can run multiple harvests in a single season s simulation should be included in aquacrop to find a good fit between measured and simulated canopy cover aquacrop required a much smaller initial canopy cover 0 1 compared to estimated canopy cover 1 67 from planting density bello and walker 2017 reported similar findings for the calibration of the model for amaranth we recommend that the food and agricultural organisation should fine tune the model to accept measured initial canopy cover for leafy vegetables the model has a tendency to under estimate soil water depletion which was alluded by mabhaudhi et al 2014 although this can be solved by increasing the effective rooting depth further research is needed to improve and adjust the model on simulating effective rooting depth currently the database of the model caters for mainstream crops limited vegetables solanum lycopersicum tomato and beta vulgaris but then as sugar beet and not as a leafy vegetable with conservative parameters are included in the database tomato contains minimal amounts of micronutrients and vitamins to construct sustainable food systems that are health focused and inclusive of rural resource poor households we recommend that more vegetables including traditional vegetables with conservative parameters are included in the model database we invite the modelling community to consider adding a module that can simulate nutritional content iron zinc and β carotene of crops this will enable crop modelling of nutritional yield and nutritional water productivity aquacrop predicts more evaporation than transpiration which seems unrealistic therefore the current method for partitioning actual evapotranspiration into evaporation and transpiration

reached the maximal values in both seasons under i100asa treatment but however without marked differences in comparing to those recorded i85asa in 2014 season moreover the differences in iwue values exhibited by i100asa and i85asa did not reach the p 0 05 level of significance in 2015 season which could reveal the positive role of asa in alleviating water stress keywords sunflower ascorbic acid

food productivity is decreasing therefore minimizing these losses is a major area of concern to ensure food security among biotic and abiotic stresses that plants encounter drought stress is one of the most adverse factors of plant growth and productivity and considered a severe threat for sustainable crop production in the conditions on changing climate anjum et al 2011 sunflowers are grown in warm to moderate semi arid climatic regions of the world from argentina to canada and from central africa to the commonwealth of independent states fao 2010 sunflower is one of the fantastic oil crops has strategic ballast in human nutrition in egypt and worldwide as well its oil is mightily desired not only for human consumption but for chemical and cosmetic industries also great assertion must be given towards such crop in attempting to close the gap between oil production and consumption so boosting productivity is considered the optimal solution but water shortage is a major yield limiting factor growing menaces of freshwater shortage and more continual and cruel drought due to climate change has catalyzed research into water saving irrigation strategies aiming at producing more crop per drop dodd 2009 morison et al 2008 thus the usage water below full crop water requirements is considered one of the substantial tools to face scarce water supplies through lowering irrigation water amounts fereres and soriano 2007 kang et al 2000 such strategy designed to improve water savings in agriculture bashir and mohamed 2014 but it should be managed with a crop in mind in addition usually using less irrigation water amounts synchronizes with yield and water use efficiency wue reductions several studies indicated that with water stress the shortage in sunflower growth and yield is realized significant reductions in plant height and plant dry matter ahmad et al 2009 leaf area index karam et al 2007 net photosynthetic rate dekov et al 2000 and weight of 1000 seeds head diameter and seed yield chimenti et al 2002 erdem et al 2006 roshdi et al 2006 occurred due to water stress under drought stress sunflower seed yield reduced by 83 0 jabari et al 2007 with 36 deficit in irrigation water 15 decrease in sunflower yield occurred sezen et al 2011 several reactive oxygen species ros such as superoxide radical o2 hydroxyl free radical oh singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 are continuously produced as byproducts of plant cellular metabolism mahalingam and fedoroff 2003 mittler et al 2004 however various environmental stresses lead to excessive production of ros causing redox imbalance progressive oxidative damage peroxidation of plasmalemma dna mutation protein denaturation and ultimately cell death fridovich 1998 sharma et al 2012 it is well documented that various abiotic stresses including drought excess light temperature extremes ultraviolet radiation salinity lead to overproduction of ros elevated levels of ros lead to the inactivation of proteins and inhibit the activity of multiple enzymes involved in metabolic pathways and result in the oxidation of other macromolecules including lipids and dna hossain et al 2014 ros may affect cell membrane properties and cause oxidative damage to proteins lipids nucleic acids carbohydrates which ultimately results in cell death gill and tuteja 2010 thus it is a quite indispensable to quench the surplus ros for plant growth and development however as a defense for survival plants developed non enzymatic antioxidants and the enzymatic scavenging systems to detoxifying ros mittler 2002 mittler et al 2004 indeed plant cells are equipped with excellent antioxidant defense mechanisms to detoxify the harmful effects of ros the antioxidant defenses could be either non enzymatic including ascorbic acid carotenoids glutathione proline and α tocopherols or enzymatic e g superoxide dismutase catalase ascorbate peroxidase glutathione reductase monodehydroascorbate reductase dehydroascorbate reductase glutathione peroxidase guaicol peroxidase and glutathione s transferase these very efficient antioxidant defense systems work in concert to control the cascades of uncontrolled oxidation and protect plant cells from oxidative damage by scavenging of ros gill and tuteja 2010 the biochemical functions of ascorbate or ascorbic acid asa also commonly known as vitamin c involve its roles as an antioxidant enzyme cofactor and electron transport prasad and upadhyay 2011 asa directly neutralizes ros by acting as a secondary antioxidant during the reductive recycling of the oxidized form of α tocopherol noctor and foyer 1998 in plants asa and glutathione are the most abundant soluble antioxidants and are the major antioxidants in photosynthetic and non photosynthetic tissues they are able to detoxify ros by a direct scavenging or by acting as cofactors in the enzymatic reactions that involved ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase enzymes laspina et al 2005 ascorbic acid treatment reduced the damaging action of drought and decreased enzyme activity due to scavenging of reactive oxygen species thereupon it may be effective for the improvement of stressed maize plants in arid and semi arid regions dolatabadian et al 2009 moreover aziz et al 2018 recorded remarkable enhancement in quinoa plants growth with application of asa being reduced adverse effects of drought stress the objective of this study was to evaluate whether treatment of asa could mitigate the adverse effects imposed on sunflower productivity due to water deficiency and boosting irrigation water use efficiency iwue besides determination of the possibility of inclusion of asa in crop irrigation programs as an antioxidative defender to support plants exposed to periods of water stress in areas with limited water resources 2 material and methods 2 1 site description over two years a field experiment was conducted during 2014 and 2015 seasons at the experimental farm of national research centre el nubaria region el behaira governorate egypt latitude 30 30 1 4 n longitude 30 19 10 9 e and mean altitude 21 m above sea level the soil was sandy with ph 8 3 and salt content 0 38 ds m 1 which measured as described by jackson 1973 physical properties and water status of the experimental soil are presented in table 1 the study area belongs to arid regions with no rainfall and hot dry in summer april september table 2 illustrates monthly mean weather factors i e maximum and minimum air temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation for 2014 and 2015 seasons obtained from central laboratory of meteorology ministry of agriculture and land reclamation egypt the preceding cultivated crop was wheat in both seasons 2 2 experimental design and procedures the present study aimed to investigate the interactive performance of ascorbic acid asa and irrigation water levels on sunflower helianthus annuus yield and iwue under the environmental conditions of the studied area el nubaria region as shown in fig 1 the experiment was established within split plots in a randomized complete block design in four replicates where irrigation levels were arranged in the main plots and ascorbic acid treatments were allocated in the sub plots the experimental unit area was 12 25 m2 involving five ridges each of 3 5 m long and 0 7 m wide the experiment included six treatments each represent a combination of irrigation water amount i and ascorbic acid asa levels as follows a three irrigation water amounts i i e 100 85 and 70 of crop evapotranspiration these treatments are denoted as i100 i85 and i70 which are considered as well watered moderately water stressed condition and severely water stressed condition respectively b two ascorbic acid asa levels i e asa zero asa tap water only and asa asa at a rate of 450 ppm amounted to 0 216 l ha 1 using knapsack sprayer with one nozzle and the carrier was 480 0 l water ha 1 each was added plus tween 20 when applied asa was divided into three equal portions 30 40 and 50 days after sowing das tween 20 c58h114o26 is a trade name for polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan monolaurate the six irrigation ascorbic acid treatments involved in the experiment are best denoted as i100asa i100asa i85asa i85asa i70asa and i70asa irrigation water requirement for sunflower was calculated by determining daily reference evapotranspiration et0 developed by fao using fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 for each growing season of sunflower fig 2 from et0 crop evapotranspiration etc was computed using the following equation according to doorenbos et al 1977 1 etc eto kc where etc crop evapotranspiration mm day 1 eto reference evapotranspiration mm day

leaching requirement 15 and ea water application efficiency 90 for trickle irrigation fig 3 shows the seasonal irrigation amounts applied for sunflower based on irrigation treatments plants were irrigated by using drippers of 2 0 l h 1 capacity irrigation water was obtained from an irrigation channel passing through the experimental area with ph 7 4 and ec 0 35 ds m 1 sunflower seeds cv sakha 53 were sown on 21 may 2014 and 2015 in hills 3 5 seeds per hill with 20 cm distance on the ridge at 15 das plants were thinned to secure one plant per hill all other recommended cultural practices were applied throughout the two seasons 2 3 sampling and assessments 2 3 1 plant parameters at 65 das four guarded plants were chosen randomly from each plot to estimate leaf area index lai and the 4th leaves from the top were used for measuring both total chlorophyll mg g 1 fresh wt according to arnon 1949 and free proline content μg g 1 fresh wt according to bates et al 1973 at harvest dates 6th august and 12th august in 2014 and 2015 respectively whole plants of each plot were harvested to estimate head weight and seed yield ha 1 oil percentage in seeds was measured by extraction using soxhlet apparatus with hexane as an organic solvent according to a o a c 1995 and then oil yield ha 1 was calculated 2 3 2 irrigation water use efficiency iwue iwue was computed to evaluate treatments with respect to maximum yield produced per unit of water used by crop plants seed moisture content was about 15 0 and the iwue was expressed as sunflower seed yield kg per applied water m3 throughout the growing season 2 4 statistical analysis data were subjected to analysis of variance anova according to gomez and gomez 1984 using costat software program version 6 303 2004 for comparing among means duncan s multiple range test at 0 05 probability level was used 3 results 3 1 chlorophyll and proline content results illustrated in table 3 show degradation in chlorophyll content and accumulation in proline content in sunflower leaves under water stress in this concern significant differences were detected among irrigation ascorbic acid treatments in both total chlorophyll and proline contents during 2014 and 2015 seasons in both seasons each decrease in water supply less than the normal well watered treatment lowered total chlorophyll but caused increment in proline content on the contrary these effects were significantly minimized and less evident when plants were treated with asa i e increasing total chlorophyll and lowering proline content when asa was involved comparing to i100asa reductions in total chlorophyll reached 27 1 and 42 7 as an average of the two seasons due to i85asa and i70asa treatments respectively such reductions however turned less with the implication of asa since 11 2 and 35 5 reductions were recorded via i85asa and i70asa respectively under i85asa and i70asa treatments proline contents were higher by 95 0 and 240 8 respectively over i100asa treatment as averages of 2014 and 2015 seasons involvement of asa on the contrary exhibited reductions in proline content to be 62 6 for i85asa and 155 1 for i70asa also the reductions of proline content under i85asa and i70asa amounted to 16 6 and 25 1 comparing to i85asa and i70asa treatments respectively obviously the role of asa in this respect is more evident under harsh water deficit where there is a positive relationship between proline content reduction and water shortage degree in the presence of asa 3 2 crop parameters leaf area index lai head weight seed yield ha 1 and oil yield ha 1 of sunflower were varied markedly among irrigation ascorbic acid treatments each decrease in water supply resulted in marked reduction in the aforementioned traits whether ascorbic acid asa is applied or not this is true in 2014 and 2015 seasons table 4 values of the forenamed traits however tended to be more with asa application so the lowest values were detected with application of i70asa the highest values on the other hand were gained by the treatment i100asa i e supplying plants with sufficient water i100 plus application of asa this superior treatment exceeded other ones for lai and oil yield ha 1 in both seasons and for head weight and seed yield ha 1 in the second season the superiority reached the maximum when comparing with severely water stressed condition without asa application i70asa well watered plants of sunflower via i100asa treatment grew well and possessed higher yields compared to that of suffering from deficit water via i85asa or i70asa the i100asa treatment surpassed i70asa by 135 2 93 8 94 0 and 141 0 as averages of the two seasons for lai head weight seed yield ha 1 and oil yield ha 1 respectively obviously those well watered plants treated with asa produced leaf areas as lai and oil yield ha 1 significantly higher than all other treatments additionally it is noted that application of asa was most pronounced in well watered i100 plots under this condition application of asa markedly increased lai and oil yield ha 1 in both seasons head weight and seed yield ha 1 in the second season under moderately water stressed condition i85 application of asa had positive and significant effects on lai in both seasons head weight in the second one and seed yield ha 1 as well as oil yield ha 1 in the first season it is worthy noted that comparable seed and oil yields ha 1 in addition to head weight produced in 2014 season under sufficient water supply i100asa could be achieved under moderately water stressed condition with applying asa i85asa moderate water deficit plus applying ascorbic acid i e i85asa treatment improved lai by about 19 9 as an average of the two seasons than moderate water deficit without ascorbic acid i e i85asa head weight substantially affected by irrigation ascorbic acid treatments table 4 plants received sufficient water and ascorbic acid i100asa possessed the heaviest head weight in 2014 and 2015 seasons by comparing the irrigation treatments when ascorbic is sprayed with their non sprayed counterpart ones it is shown that applying ascorbic acid caused as average 11 8 and 8 9 increases in head weight in 2014 and 2015 respectively such effect was more pronounced under i85asa i e moderately water stressed condition in both seasons under severely water stressed condition i70 however application of asa had no significant effect on the forenamed four traits except on head weight in second season 3 3 water saving and yield changes considering i100aas well watered condition without asa application as a reference treatment there are increments in sunflower seed yield amounted to 0 37 t ha 1 13 4 in 2014 season and 0 27 t ha 1 8 9 in 2015 season when plants well watered also in conjunction to applying asa i e i100as treatment on the same basic water is saved but seed yield is reduced with each of the rest four treatments stressed conditions compared to the reference one i100as the water saved and the seed yield reductions in 2014 and 2015 seasons are calculated and presented in table 5 in this regard supplying plants with water below full crop water requirements at moderate rate via i85asa or i85asa each saved 15 0 of water yield reductions ranged between 5 8 23 9 in 2014 and 17 5 20 9 in 2015 respectively more decrease in water supply via i70asa led to severe yield losses reached 31 2 42 7 in both seasons it is interesting to note that implication of asa in the treatment tend to minimize the reduction in seed yield i85asa and i85asa for example each saved same percentage of water 15 0 but the reduction in seed yield relative to i100aas associated i85asa was less than that produced under i85asa treatment the same could be noticed for i70asa and i70asa each saved 30 of water the difference is always in favor of irrigation treatment with ascorbic acid 3 4 irrigation water use efficiency iwue depending on irrigation ascorbic acid treatments iwue values expressed as kg seed yield ha 1 of applied water m3 ha 1 for 2014 and 2015 seasons were different fig 4 the maximal iwue obtained with i100asa in both seasons but significantly equaled with i85asa in 2014 moreover the differences in iwue between i100asa and i85asa did not reach the p 0 05 level of significance in 2015 with the superiority of i85asa in 2014 the beneficial effect of asa implication on iwue was pronounced under moderately water stressed in the first season and well watered condition in both seasons furthermore with lowering irrigation water less than i85asa iwue tended to decrease as for i70asa or i70asa 4 discussion 4 1 chlorophyll and proline content the results of the present study showed the association between water stress and both reduction in chlorophyll content and increasing proline content of sunflower leaves table 3 such findings are in accordance with those found by manivannan et al 2007 who reported that water stress caused large decline in sunflower leaf contents of chlorophyll a b total chlorophyll and carotenoid but increased proline content while reduced the activity of proline oxidase concerning chlorophyll content of sunflower leaves there was a substantial adverse impact of water deficit for example effect of i85asa and i70asa treatments table 3 leaves of water stressed sunflower plants contained chlorophyll content significantly less comparing to those grown under well watered condition kiani et al 2008 chlorophyll is one of the major chloroplast components for photosynthesis and relative chlorophyll content has a positive relationship with photosynthetic rate anjum et al 2011 low concentrations of photosynthetic pigments can directly limit photosynthetic potential and hence primary production from a physiological perspective leaf chlorophyll content is a parameter of significant interest in its own right the decrease in chlorophyll content under drought stress has been considered a typical symptom of oxidative stress and may be the result of pigment photo oxidation and chlorophyll degradation photosynthetic pigments are important to plants mainly for harvesting light and production of reducing powers anjum et al 2011 under water deficit stress chloroplast ultrastructures are the first targets to be damaged in the cellular levels since it is the major site of ros production munné bosch and peñuelas 2003 as reviewed it is well documented that various abiotic stresses including drought lead to the overproduction of ros in plants which are highly reactive and toxic and ultimately results in oxidative stress gill and tuteja 2010 the generation of ros is one of the earliest biochemical responses of eukaryotic cells to biotic and abiotic stresses the production of ros in plants known as the oxidative burst is an early event of plant defense response to water stress and acts as a secondary massager to trigger subsequent defense reaction in plants anjum et al 2011 herein treating plants with asa under such conditions kept chlorophyll less affected table 3 asa is among non enzymatic antioxidants that plants use to protect themselves from oxidative damage by scavenging and eliminating of ros gill and tuteja 2010 prasad and upadhyay 2011 asa is an antioxidant able to detoxify ros by a direct scavenging or by acting as cofactors in the enzymatic reactions that involved ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase enzymes laspina et al 2005 asa participates in a variety of processes including photosynthesis cell wall growth and cell expansion resistance to environmental stresses and synthesis of ethylene gibberellins anthocyanine and hydroxyl proline galal et al 2000 smirnoff and wheeler 2000 moreover asa as an antioxidant can quench ros resulted in water stress diminishing lipid peroxidation and consequently maintaining chlorophyll content at acceptable level for plant growth as illustrated in table 3 irrigating sunflower plants below full crop water requirements showed increasing proline content especially with severely water stressed conditions water stress caused increase in proline content while reduced the activity of proline oxidase in sunflower leaves manivannan et al 2007 herein as the irrigation water decreases by 1 0 proline content increases by 9 59 with i85asa and 12 14 with i70asa relative to i100asa as an average of 2014 and 2015 seasons proline is among non enzymatic antioxidants that plants use to protect themselves from oxidative damage by scavenging of ros gill and tuteja 2010 proline enrichment in the stressed plants is a general response to various abiotic stresses hence it has been developed as effective indices for stress tolerance identification abdel nasser and abdel aal 2002 accumulation of proline increases in water stressed leaves of several crops such as barley bean sunflower chickpea and cotton however large increases in proline occur at moderate to severe stress levels khanna chopra 2003 the high capability of proline to quench singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxy radicals oh can be well understood by its chemical properties pyrrolidine which forms the 5 membered ring of proline has a remarkably low ionization potential and therefore proline is capable of forming charge transfer complex and can quench singlet oxygen effectively proline reacts with oh under hydrogen abstraction by forming the most stable radical which carries the spin on the c 5 atom proline composes of cc or co double bonds within the structure which plays as a central core to protect plants against singlet oxygen and free radical induced damages therefore proline accumulation in high amounts in plants under stress could be well understood by its property to scavenge ros matysik et al 2002 moreover proline accumulation in stressed plants has been well established to play a key role as osmoregulation defense mechanism leading to prevent the cell osmotic pressure and survive in the extreme conditions sankar et al 2007 high proline accumulations in plant cells may reflect the reduction in lipid peroxidation products acting as free radical scavenger and its binding with redox active metal ions can prevent the biological tissues damaging by oh free radicals hsu et al 2003 in the present study asa modulated proline content towards counteracting the impact of water deficit in this respect as the irrigation water decreases by 1 0 in conjunction with asa application proline content increases only by 6 31 with i85asa and 7 82 with i70asa as an average of 2014 and 2015 seasons these suggest that an integration and coordination relationship might be between asa and proline for protecting plants against stressful condition 4 2 crop parameters as previously detected the investigated sunflower crop parameters contained in table 4 i e lai and head weight as well as seed and oil yields responded significantly to different irrigation ascorbic acid treatments in this regard well watered plants grew well and produced higher yields compared to those suffering from water deficit i e via i85asa or i70asa sunflower plants are drought resistant but yield and oil content are reduced if they are exposed to drought stress during the main growing and flowering periods i e irrigation is a key factor for obtaining high yields fao 2010 although sunflower is known as a drought tolerant crop or grown under dry land conditions substantial yield increases are achieved by irrigation and many researchers have reported decreasing its performance under water stress conditions erdem et al 2006 nezami et al 2008 water stress significantly reduced root length stem length total leaf area fresh and dry weight of sunflower plants manivannan et al 2007 furthermore plant height head diameter number of seeds per head 1000 seed weight biological yield seed yield harvest index and oil yield of sunflower under drought stress declined with increasing water stress soleimanzadeh et al 2010 soriano et al 2004 however attaching asa to moderate water deficit treatment via i85asa achieved acceptable growth and yields being produced head weight seed yield ha 1 significantly equivalents to those of i100asa treatment in 2014 season in addition to surpassing i85asa treatment for lai in both seasons head weight in the second season and seed yield in the first season thus it seems that there is a complementary effect between lowering irrigation water by 15 0 moderate rate and spraying asa for enhancing sunflower yield this indicates that growing sunflower under moderately water stressed condition 15 of water supply could be saved if asa is applied with no significant decrease in yield thus the treatment of i85asa may considered as a promising practice under areas suffering from water shortage ascorbic acid induced growth improvement through increase leaf area dolatabadian and jouneghani 2009 which is the photosynthesizing tissue of the plant moreover the positive effect of ascorbic acid may be attribute to its crucial role in improvement flag leaf area and leaf chlorophyll content which in turn enhance vegetative and reproductive growth carbohydrates accumulation and seed set athar et al 2009 smirnoff 2000 xu et al 2015 observed that foliar application of ascorbic acid ameliorates the adverse of water stress due to stomata closure nutrient uptake total chlorophyll content protein synthesis photosynthesis and plant growth the benefits of exogenous asa application in order to attenuate water deficit stress include increased nutrient uptake improved leaf and root growth reduced lipid peroxidation and relieved oxidative stress as well as it might provide a suitably attractive target for the enhancement of crop production khan et al 2011 4 3 water saving and yield changes data allocated in table 5 showed that ascorbic acid has beneficial effect on sunflower seed yield not only under water stressed condition but also under state of water availability although no water saving in this connection well watered plants produced more seed yield if asa was applied i100asa than without i100asa moreover in the case when saving water by 15 0 amounted to 807 5 m3ha 1 in 2014 season and 730 2 m3ha 1 in 2015 one for i85asa treatment the reduction of seed yield ranged between 16 6 24 3 in both seasons on the other hand in spite of the fact that water saving of 30 amounted to 1615 3 m3ha 1 in 2014 season and 1460 4 m3ha 1 in 2015 one in the case of i70asa treatment but more reductions about 39 2 45 2 were recorded could not be accepted in seed yield in general such results reveal the potency of asa to save water under low water supply in sunflower fields maintaining high leaf relative water content at low water potentials by asa may indicate greater strength of the cell wall and its ability to withstand against the loss of water plant growth improvement under water stress treatments could be associated with asa induced improvement in leaf relative water naz et al 2016 ascorbic acid can ameliorate the negative effects of water stress by acting as a growth factor to accelerate shoot and root growth under water stress and reduce the loss of turgidity in flag leaves under water stress hafez and gharib 2016 4 4 irrigation water use efficiency iwue data illustrated in fig 4 showed that severely water deficit i e i70asa diminished iwue than under well watered condition in general iwue tended to increase with alleviating water stress by applying asa so the maximal values of iwue were recorded with i100asa i100asa and i85asa asa application was more benefit on iwue under moderately water stressed and well watered conditions these results could be explained in the viewpoint of seed yields produced under such conditions more than under other ones resulting in higher iwue values it can be considered that at low wue photosynthetic carbon assimilation is decreased due to decreasing flow of co2 into mesophyll tissue and the closure of stomata chaves et al 2003 flexas et al 2004 as there was a positive significant correlation between wue and total dry weight canavar et al 2014 this elucidates that increasing leaf relative water content is an indication of an increase in swelling pressure in plant cells leading to increase in growth jiang and huang 2002 ünyayar et al 2009 this increase has been noted to be related probably to the actual rate of photosynthetic co2 assimilation stomatal conductance and co2 supply lawlor and cornic 2002 and osmotic adjustment following drought stomata close progressively with a parallel decline in net photosynthesis and water use efficiency anjum et al 2011 our findings pointed out that the potency of asa treated sunflower plants can relatively convert applied water into production of seeds under moderate deficit water conditions as well watered one whereas i85asa treatment was on par with i100asa for iwue thus irrigating asa treated sunflower plants with moderately water deficit may maintain a proper status of stomata closure due to improving leaf relative water content and cell turgidity plant growth improvement under water stress treatments could be associated with asa induced improvement in leaf relative water naz et al 2016 reducing the loss of turgidity hafez and gharib 2016 5 conclusion farmers are often obliged in arid land regions to irrigate their crops using less water than needed in this situation losses in economic yields realized thus our study advises them to introduce asa in irrigation program to relatively mitigate the detrimental impact associated low water supply herein the use of asa as a save and cheap foliar spray during the intermittent dry spells especially in vegetative crop growth stage is regarded necessary even if there is sufficient irrigation water they can use moderately water stressed plus asa pattern via i85asa treatment with saving 15 of irrigation water used to irrigate more fields hence the treatment of i85asa may considered a promising practice under areas suffering from water shortage for sunflower crop management acknowledgements the authors

11367,ascorbic acid asa is considered as one of the most important and profusely known occurring water soluble antioxidants in plants however it is not well known to what extent this antioxidant might contribute in alleviating the adverse effects of water deficit on plant growth yield and irrigation water use efficiency iwue in attempt to clarify whether exogenous application of asa could alleviate the adverse effects of water deficit on sunflower plants two seasons 2014 and 2015 of field experimentation were conducted using six combinations of two asa levels asa and asa i e zero and 450 ppm asa respectively and three irrigation water amounts i100 i85 and i70 i e 100 85 and 70 of crop evapotranspiration respectively under water shortage leaf chlorophyll content increased but proline content lowered in asa treated plants compared to the untreated ones lower values of lai head weight seed yield ha 1 and oil yield ha 1 were recorded with decreasing water supply while the highest values were gained when supplying plants with sufficient water i100 plus application of asa i e asa i e i100asa plants under the latter treatment grew well and possessed higher yields compared to that of suffering from deficit water without asa application i e i85asa or i70asa head weight and seed as well as oil yields ha 1 produced in 2014 season under sufficient water supply without asa application i100asa could be achieved under moderately water stressed condition in conjunction with applying asa i85asa implication of asa tends to minimize the reduction in seed yield due to insufficient water supply where i85asa and i85asa each saved same percentage of water 15 0 but the reduction in seed yield associated the former treatment was less than that under the latter one on the other hand iwue reached the maximal values in both seasons under i100asa treatment but however without marked differences in comparing to those recorded i85asa in 2014 season moreover the differences in iwue values exhibited by i100asa and i85asa did not reach the p 0 05 level of significance in 2015 season which could reveal the positive role of asa in alleviating water stress keywords sunflower ascorbic acid water deficit yield irrigation water use efficiency 1 introduction plants in nature are continuously exposed to several biotic and abiotic stresses due to the detrimental impacts of these stresses food productivity is decreasing therefore minimizing these losses is a major area of concern to ensure food security among biotic and abiotic stresses that plants encounter drought stress is one of the most adverse factors of plant growth and productivity and considered a severe threat for sustainable crop production in the conditions on changing climate anjum et al 2011 sunflowers are grown in warm to moderate semi arid climatic regions of the world from argentina to canada and from central africa to the commonwealth of independent states fao 2010 sunflower is one of the fantastic oil crops has strategic ballast in human nutrition in egypt and worldwide as well its oil is mightily desired not only for human consumption but for chemical and cosmetic industries also great assertion must be given towards such crop in attempting to close the gap between oil production and consumption so boosting productivity is considered the optimal solution but water shortage is a major yield limiting factor growing menaces of freshwater shortage and more continual and cruel drought due to climate change has catalyzed research into water saving irrigation strategies aiming at producing more crop per drop dodd 2009 morison et al 2008 thus the usage water below full crop water requirements is considered one of the substantial tools to face scarce water supplies through lowering irrigation water amounts fereres and soriano 2007 kang et al 2000 such strategy designed to improve water savings in agriculture bashir and mohamed 2014 but it should be managed with a crop in mind in addition usually using less irrigation water amounts synchronizes with yield and water use efficiency wue reductions several studies indicated that with water stress the shortage in sunflower growth and yield is realized significant reductions in plant height and plant dry matter ahmad et al 2009 leaf area index karam et al 2007 net photosynthetic rate dekov et al 2000 and weight of 1000 seeds head diameter and seed yield chimenti et al 2002 erdem et al 2006 roshdi et al 2006 occurred due to water stress under drought stress sunflower seed yield reduced by 83 0 jabari et al 2007 with 36 deficit in irrigation water 15 decrease in sunflower yield occurred sezen et al 2011 several reactive oxygen species ros such as superoxide radical o2 hydroxyl free radical oh singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 are continuously produced as byproducts of plant cellular metabolism mahalingam and fedoroff 2003 mittler et al 2004 however various environmental stresses lead to excessive production of ros causing redox imbalance progressive oxidative damage peroxidation of plasmalemma dna mutation protein denaturation and ultimately cell death fridovich 1998 sharma et al 2012 it is well documented that various abiotic stresses including drought excess light temperature extremes ultraviolet radiation salinity lead to overproduction of ros elevated levels of ros lead to the inactivation of proteins and inhibit the activity of multiple enzymes involved in metabolic pathways and result in the oxidation of other macromolecules including lipids and dna hossain et al 2014 ros may affect cell membrane properties and cause oxidative damage to proteins lipids nucleic acids carbohydrates which ultimately results in cell death gill and tuteja 2010 thus it is a quite indispensable to quench the surplus ros for plant growth and development however as a defense for survival plants developed non enzymatic antioxidants and the enzymatic scavenging systems to detoxifying ros mittler 2002 mittler et al 2004 indeed plant cells are equipped with excellent antioxidant defense mechanisms to detoxify the harmful effects of ros the antioxidant defenses could be either non enzymatic including ascorbic acid carotenoids glutathione proline and α tocopherols or enzymatic e g superoxide dismutase catalase ascorbate peroxidase glutathione reductase monodehydroascorbate reductase dehydroascorbate reductase glutathione peroxidase guaicol peroxidase and glutathione s transferase these very efficient antioxidant defense systems work in concert to control the cascades of uncontrolled oxidation and protect plant cells from oxidative damage by scavenging of ros gill and tuteja 2010 the biochemical functions of ascorbate or ascorbic acid asa also commonly known as vitamin c involve its roles as an antioxidant enzyme cofactor and electron transport prasad and upadhyay 2011 asa directly neutralizes ros by acting as a secondary antioxidant during the reductive recycling of the oxidized form of α tocopherol noctor and foyer 1998 in plants asa and glutathione are the most abundant soluble antioxidants and are the major antioxidants in photosynthetic and non photosynthetic tissues they are able to detoxify ros by a direct scavenging or by acting as cofactors in the enzymatic reactions that involved ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase enzymes laspina et al 2005 ascorbic acid treatment reduced the damaging action of drought and decreased enzyme activity due to scavenging of reactive oxygen species thereupon it may be effective for the improvement of stressed maize plants in arid and semi arid regions dolatabadian et al 2009 moreover aziz et al 2018 recorded remarkable enhancement in quinoa plants growth with application of asa being reduced adverse effects of drought stress the objective of this study was to evaluate whether treatment of asa could mitigate the adverse effects imposed on sunflower productivity due to water deficiency and boosting irrigation water use efficiency iwue besides determination of the possibility of inclusion of asa in crop irrigation programs as an antioxidative defender to support plants exposed to periods of water stress in areas with limited water resources 2 material and methods 2 1 site description over two years a field experiment was conducted during 2014 and 2015 seasons at the experimental farm of national research centre el nubaria region el behaira governorate egypt latitude 30 30 1 4 n longitude 30 19 10 9 e and mean altitude 21 m above sea level the soil was sandy with ph 8 3 and salt content 0 38 ds m 1 which measured as described by jackson 1973 physical properties and water status of the experimental soil are presented in table 1 the

wind speed and solar radiation for 2014 and 2015 seasons obtained from central laboratory of meteorology ministry of agriculture and land reclamation egypt the preceding cultivated crop was wheat in both seasons 2 2 experimental design and procedures the present study aimed to investigate the interactive performance of ascorbic acid asa and irrigation water levels on sunflower helianthus annuus yield and iwue under the environmental conditions of the studied area el nubaria region as shown in fig 1 the experiment was established within split plots in a randomized complete block design in four replicates where irrigation levels were arranged in the main plots and ascorbic acid treatments were allocated in the sub plots the experimental unit area was 12 25 m2 involving five ridges each of 3 5 m long and 0 7 m wide the experiment included six treatments each represent a combination of irrigation water amount i and ascorbic acid asa levels as follows a three irrigation water amounts i i e 100 85 and 70 of crop evapotranspiration these treatments are denoted as i100 i85 and i70 which are considered as well watered moderately water stressed condition and severely water stressed condition respectively b two ascorbic acid asa levels i e asa zero asa tap water only and asa asa at a rate of 450 ppm amounted to 0 216 l ha 1 using knapsack sprayer with one nozzle and the carrier

sorbitan monolaurate the six irrigation ascorbic acid treatments involved in the experiment are best denoted as i100asa i100asa i85asa i85asa i70asa and i70asa irrigation water requirement for sunflower was calculated by determining daily reference evapotranspiration et0 developed by fao using fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 for each growing season of sunflower fig 2 from et0

irrigated by using drippers of 2 0 l h 1 capacity irrigation water was obtained from an irrigation channel passing through the experimental area with ph 7 4 and ec 0 35 ds m 1 sunflower seeds cv sakha 53 were sown on 21 may 2014 and 2015 in hills 3 5 seeds per hill with 20 cm distance on the ridge at 15 das plants were thinned to secure one plant per hill all other recommended cultural practices were applied throughout the two seasons 2 3 sampling and assessments 2 3 1 plant parameters at 65 das four guarded plants were chosen randomly from each plot to estimate leaf area index lai and the 4th leaves from the top were used for measuring both total chlorophyll mg g 1 fresh wt according to arnon 1949 and free proline content μg g 1 fresh wt according to bates et al 1973 at harvest dates 6th august and 12th august in 2014 and 2015 respectively whole plants of each plot were harvested to estimate head weight and seed yield ha 1 oil percentage in seeds was measured by extraction using soxhlet apparatus with hexane as an organic solvent according to a o a c 1995 and then oil yield ha 1 was calculated 2 3 2 irrigation water use efficiency iwue iwue was computed to evaluate treatments with respect to maximum yield produced per unit of water used by crop plants seed moisture content was about 15 0 and the iwue was expressed as sunflower seed yield kg per applied water m3 throughout the growing season 2 4 statistical analysis data were subjected to analysis of variance anova according to gomez and gomez 1984 using costat software program version 6 303 2004 for comparing among means duncan s multiple range test at 0 05 probability level was used 3 results 3 1 chlorophyll and proline content results illustrated in table 3 show degradation in chlorophyll content and accumulation in proline content in sunflower leaves under water stress in this concern significant differences were detected among irrigation ascorbic acid treatments in both total chlorophyll and proline contents during 2014 and 2015 seasons in both seasons each decrease in water supply less than the normal well watered treatment lowered total chlorophyll but caused increment in proline content on the contrary these effects were significantly minimized and less evident when plants were treated with asa i e increasing total chlorophyll and lowering proline content when asa was involved comparing to i100asa reductions in total chlorophyll reached 27 1 and 42 7 as an average of the two seasons due to i85asa and i70asa treatments respectively such reductions however turned less with the implication of asa since 11 2 and 35 5 reductions were recorded via i85asa and i70asa respectively under i85asa and i70asa treatments proline contents were higher by 95 0 and 240 8 respectively over i100asa treatment as averages of 2014 and 2015 seasons involvement of asa on the contrary exhibited reductions in proline content to be 62 6 for i85asa and 155 1 for i70asa also the reductions of proline content under i85asa and i70asa amounted to 16 6 and 25 1 comparing to i85asa and i70asa treatments respectively obviously the role of asa in this respect is more evident under harsh water deficit where there is a positive relationship between proline content reduction and water shortage degree in the presence of asa 3 2 crop parameters leaf area index lai head weight seed yield ha 1 and oil yield ha 1 of sunflower were varied markedly among irrigation ascorbic acid treatments each decrease in water supply resulted in marked reduction in the aforementioned traits whether ascorbic acid asa is applied or not this is true in 2014 and 2015 seasons table 4 values of the forenamed traits however tended to be more with asa application so the lowest values were detected with application of i70asa the highest values on the other hand were gained by the treatment i100asa i e supplying plants with sufficient water i100 plus application of asa this superior treatment exceeded other ones for lai and oil yield ha 1 in both seasons and for head weight and seed yield ha 1 in the second season the superiority reached the maximum when comparing with severely water stressed condition without asa application i70asa well watered plants of sunflower via i100asa treatment grew well and possessed higher yields compared to that of suffering from deficit water via i85asa or i70asa the i100asa treatment surpassed i70asa by 135 2 93 8 94 0 and 141 0 as averages of the two seasons for lai head weight seed yield ha 1 and oil yield ha 1 respectively obviously those well watered plants treated with asa produced leaf areas as lai and oil yield ha 1 significantly higher than all other treatments additionally it is noted that application of asa was most pronounced in well watered i100 plots under this condition application of asa markedly increased lai and oil yield ha 1 in both seasons head weight and seed yield ha 1 in the second season under moderately water stressed condition i85 application of asa had positive and significant effects on lai in both seasons head weight in the second one and seed yield ha 1 as well as oil yield ha 1 in the first season it is worthy noted that comparable seed and oil yields ha 1 in addition to head weight produced in 2014 season under sufficient water supply i100asa could be achieved under moderately water stressed condition with applying asa i85asa moderate water deficit plus applying ascorbic acid i e i85asa treatment improved lai by about 19 9 as an average of the two seasons than moderate water deficit without ascorbic acid i e i85asa head weight substantially affected by irrigation ascorbic acid treatments table 4 plants received sufficient water and ascorbic acid i100asa possessed the heaviest head weight in 2014 and 2015 seasons by comparing the irrigation treatments when ascorbic is sprayed with their non sprayed counterpart ones it is shown that applying ascorbic acid caused as average 11 8 and 8 9 increases in head weight in 2014 and 2015 respectively such effect was more pronounced under i85asa i e moderately water stressed condition in both seasons under severely water stressed condition i70 however application of asa had no significant effect on the forenamed four traits except on head weight in second season 3 3 water saving and yield changes considering i100aas well watered condition without asa application as a reference treatment there are increments in sunflower seed yield amounted to 0 37 t ha 1 13 4 in 2014 season and 0 27 t ha 1 8 9 in 2015 season when plants well watered also in conjunction to applying asa i e i100as treatment on the same basic water is saved but seed yield is reduced with each of the rest four treatments stressed conditions compared to the reference one i100as the water saved and the seed yield reductions in 2014 and 2015 seasons are calculated and presented in table 5 in this regard supplying plants with water below full crop water requirements at moderate rate via i85asa or i85asa each saved 15 0 of water yield reductions ranged between 5 8 23 9 in 2014 and 17 5 20 9 in 2015 respectively more decrease in water supply via i70asa led to severe yield losses reached 31 2 42 7 in both seasons it is interesting to note that implication of asa in the treatment tend to minimize the reduction in seed yield i85asa and i85asa for example each saved same percentage of water 15 0 but the reduction in seed yield relative to i100aas associated i85asa was less than that produced under i85asa treatment the same could be noticed for i70asa and i70asa each saved 30 of water the difference is always in favor of irrigation treatment with ascorbic acid 3 4 irrigation water use efficiency iwue depending on irrigation ascorbic acid treatments iwue values expressed as kg seed yield ha 1 of applied water m3 ha 1 for 2014 and 2015 seasons were different fig 4 the maximal iwue obtained with i100asa in both seasons but significantly equaled with i85asa in 2014 moreover the differences in iwue between i100asa and i85asa did not reach the p 0 05 level of significance in 2015 with the superiority of i85asa in 2014 the beneficial effect of asa implication on iwue was pronounced under moderately water stressed in the first season and well watered condition in both seasons furthermore with lowering irrigation water less than i85asa iwue tended to decrease as for i70asa or i70asa 4 discussion 4 1 chlorophyll and proline content the results of the present study showed the association between water stress and both reduction in chlorophyll content and increasing proline content of sunflower leaves table 3 such findings are in accordance with those found by manivannan et al 2007 who reported that water stress caused large decline in sunflower leaf contents of chlorophyll a b total chlorophyll and carotenoid but increased proline content while reduced the activity of proline oxidase concerning chlorophyll content of sunflower leaves there was a substantial adverse impact of water deficit for example effect of i85asa and i70asa treatments table 3 leaves of water stressed sunflower plants contained chlorophyll content significantly less comparing to those grown under well watered condition kiani et al 2008 chlorophyll is one of the major chloroplast components for photosynthesis and relative chlorophyll content has a positive relationship with photosynthetic rate anjum et al 2011 low concentrations of photosynthetic pigments can directly limit photosynthetic potential and hence primary production from a physiological perspective leaf chlorophyll content is a parameter of significant interest in its own right the decrease in chlorophyll content under drought stress has been considered a typical symptom of oxidative stress and may be the result of pigment photo oxidation and chlorophyll degradation photosynthetic pigments are important to plants mainly for harvesting light and production of reducing powers anjum et al 2011 under water deficit stress chloroplast ultrastructures are the first targets to be damaged in the cellular levels since it is the major site of ros production munné bosch and peñuelas 2003 as reviewed it is well documented that various abiotic stresses including drought lead to the overproduction of ros in plants which are highly reactive and toxic and ultimately results in oxidative stress gill and tuteja 2010 the generation of ros is one of the earliest biochemical responses of eukaryotic cells to biotic and abiotic stresses the production of ros in plants known as the oxidative burst is an early event of plant defense response to water stress and acts as a secondary massager to trigger subsequent defense reaction in plants anjum et al 2011 herein treating plants with asa under such conditions kept chlorophyll less affected table 3 asa is among non enzymatic antioxidants that plants use to protect themselves from oxidative damage by scavenging and eliminating of ros gill and tuteja 2010 prasad and upadhyay 2011 asa is an antioxidant able to detoxify ros by a direct scavenging or by acting as cofactors in the enzymatic reactions that involved ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase enzymes laspina et al 2005 asa participates in a variety of processes including photosynthesis cell wall growth and cell expansion resistance to environmental stresses and synthesis of ethylene gibberellins anthocyanine and hydroxyl proline galal et al 2000 smirnoff and wheeler 2000 moreover asa as an antioxidant can quench ros resulted in water stress diminishing lipid peroxidation and consequently maintaining chlorophyll content at acceptable level for plant growth as illustrated in table 3 irrigating sunflower plants below full crop water requirements showed increasing proline content especially with severely water stressed conditions water stress caused increase in proline content while reduced the activity of proline oxidase in sunflower leaves manivannan et al 2007 herein as the irrigation water decreases by 1 0 proline content increases by 9 59 with i85asa and 12 14 with i70asa relative to i100asa as an average of 2014 and 2015 seasons proline is among non enzymatic antioxidants that plants use to protect themselves from oxidative damage by scavenging of ros gill and tuteja 2010 proline enrichment in the stressed plants is a general response to various abiotic stresses hence it has been developed as effective indices for stress tolerance identification abdel nasser and abdel aal 2002 accumulation of proline increases in water stressed leaves of several crops such as barley bean sunflower chickpea and cotton however large increases in proline occur at moderate to severe stress levels khanna chopra 2003 the high capability of proline to quench singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxy radicals oh can be well understood by its chemical properties pyrrolidine which forms the 5 membered ring of proline has a remarkably low ionization potential and therefore proline is capable of forming charge transfer complex and can quench singlet oxygen effectively proline reacts with oh under hydrogen abstraction by forming the most stable radical which carries the spin on the c 5 atom proline composes of cc or co double bonds within the structure which plays as a central core to protect plants against singlet oxygen and free radical induced damages therefore proline accumulation in high amounts in plants under stress could be well understood by its property to scavenge ros matysik et al 2002 moreover proline accumulation in stressed plants has been well established to play a key role as osmoregulation defense mechanism leading to prevent the cell osmotic pressure and survive in the extreme conditions sankar et al 2007 high proline accumulations in plant cells may reflect the reduction in lipid peroxidation products acting as free radical scavenger and its binding with redox active metal ions can prevent the biological tissues damaging by oh free radicals hsu et al 2003 in the present study asa modulated proline content towards counteracting the impact of water deficit in this respect as the irrigation water decreases by 1 0 in conjunction with asa application proline content increases only by 6 31 with i85asa and 7 82 with i70asa as an average of 2014 and 2015 seasons these suggest that an integration and coordination relationship might be between asa and proline for protecting plants against stressful condition 4 2 crop parameters as previously detected the investigated sunflower crop parameters contained in table 4 i e lai and head weight as well as seed and oil yields responded significantly to different irrigation ascorbic acid treatments in this regard well watered plants grew well and produced higher yields compared to those suffering from water deficit i e via i85asa or i70asa sunflower plants are drought resistant but yield and oil content are reduced if they are exposed to drought stress during the main growing and flowering periods i e irrigation is a key factor for obtaining high yields fao 2010 although sunflower is known as a drought tolerant crop or grown under dry land conditions substantial yield increases are achieved by irrigation and many researchers have reported decreasing its performance under water stress conditions erdem et al 2006 nezami et al 2008 water stress significantly reduced root length stem length total leaf area fresh and dry weight of sunflower plants manivannan et al 2007 furthermore plant height head diameter number of seeds per head 1000 seed weight biological yield seed yield harvest index and oil yield of sunflower under drought stress declined with increasing water stress soleimanzadeh et al 2010 soriano et al 2004 however attaching asa to moderate water deficit treatment via i85asa achieved acceptable growth and yields being produced head weight seed yield ha 1 significantly equivalents to those of i100asa treatment in 2014 season in addition to surpassing i85asa treatment for lai in both seasons head weight in the second season and seed yield in the first season thus it seems that there is a complementary effect between lowering irrigation water by 15 0 moderate rate and spraying asa for enhancing sunflower yield this indicates that growing sunflower under moderately water stressed condition 15 of water supply could be saved if asa is applied with no significant decrease in yield thus the treatment of i85asa may considered as a promising practice under areas suffering from water shortage ascorbic acid induced growth improvement through increase leaf area dolatabadian and jouneghani 2009 which is the photosynthesizing tissue of the plant moreover the positive effect of ascorbic acid may be attribute to its crucial role in improvement flag leaf area and leaf chlorophyll content which in turn enhance vegetative and reproductive growth carbohydrates accumulation and seed set athar et al 2009 smirnoff 2000 xu et al 2015 observed that foliar application of ascorbic acid ameliorates the adverse of water stress due to stomata closure nutrient uptake total chlorophyll content protein synthesis photosynthesis and plant growth the benefits of exogenous asa application in order to attenuate water deficit stress include increased nutrient uptake improved leaf and root growth reduced lipid peroxidation and relieved oxidative stress as well as it might provide a suitably attractive target for the enhancement of crop production khan et al 2011 4 3 water saving and yield changes data allocated in table 5 showed that ascorbic acid has beneficial effect on sunflower seed yield not only under water stressed condition but also under state of water availability although no water saving in this connection well watered plants produced more seed yield if asa was applied i100asa than without i100asa moreover in the case when saving water by 15 0 amounted to 807 5 m3ha 1 in 2014 season and 730 2 m3ha 1 in 2015 one for i85asa treatment the reduction of seed yield ranged between 16 6 24 3 in both seasons on the other hand in spite of the fact that water saving of 30 amounted to 1615 3 m3ha 1 in 2014 season and 1460 4 m3ha 1 in 2015 one in the case of i70asa treatment but more reductions about 39 2 45 2 were recorded could not be accepted in seed yield in general such results reveal the potency of asa to save water under low water supply in sunflower fields maintaining high leaf relative water content at low water potentials by asa may indicate greater strength of the cell wall and its ability to withstand against the loss of water plant growth improvement under water stress treatments could be associated with asa induced improvement in leaf relative water naz et al 2016 ascorbic acid can ameliorate the negative effects of water stress by acting as a growth factor to accelerate shoot and root growth under water stress and reduce the loss of turgidity in flag leaves under water stress hafez and gharib 2016 4 4 irrigation water use efficiency iwue data illustrated in fig 4 showed that severely water deficit i e i70asa diminished iwue than under well watered condition in general iwue tended to increase with alleviating water stress by applying asa so the maximal values of iwue were recorded with i100asa i100asa and i85asa asa application was more benefit on iwue under moderately water stressed and well watered conditions these results could be explained in the viewpoint of seed yields produced under such conditions more than under other ones resulting in higher iwue values it can be considered that at low wue photosynthetic carbon assimilation is decreased due to decreasing flow of co2 into mesophyll tissue and the closure of stomata chaves et al 2003 flexas et al 2004 as there was a positive significant correlation between wue and total dry weight canavar et al 2014 this elucidates that increasing leaf relative water content is an indication of an increase in swelling pressure in plant cells leading to increase in growth jiang and huang 2002 ünyayar et al 2009 this increase has been noted to be related probably to the actual rate of photosynthetic co2 assimilation stomatal conductance and co2 supply lawlor and cornic 2002 and osmotic adjustment following drought stomata close progressively with a parallel decline in net photosynthesis and water use efficiency anjum et al 2011 our findings pointed out that the potency of asa treated sunflower plants can relatively convert applied water into production of seeds under moderate deficit water conditions as well watered one whereas i85asa treatment was on par with i100asa for iwue thus irrigating asa treated sunflower plants with moderately water deficit may maintain a proper status of stomata closure due to improving leaf relative water content and cell turgidity plant growth improvement under water stress treatments could be associated with asa induced improvement in leaf relative water naz et al 2016 reducing the loss of turgidity hafez and gharib 2016 5 conclusion farmers are often obliged in arid land regions to irrigate their crops using less water than needed in this situation losses in economic yields realized thus our study advises them to introduce asa in irrigation program to relatively mitigate the detrimental impact associated low water supply herein the use of asa as a save and cheap foliar spray during the intermittent dry spells especially in vegetative crop growth stage is regarded necessary even if there is sufficient irrigation water they can use moderately water stressed plus asa pattern via i85asa treatment with saving 15 of irrigation water used to irrigate more fields hence the treatment of i85asa may considered a promising practice under areas suffering from water shortage for sunflower crop management acknowledgements the authors

deduction of the optimal solution for an estimation problem and parallelly reduced the time of computation ghorbani et al 2017 much attention has been given to the nature inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithms enabling them to enhance the performance of other standalone ai models yang 2010 several wrapper types of nature inspired optimization algorithms evidenced to enhance the predictability performance abdullah et al 2014 gromov and shulga 2012 sudheer et al 2013 the recently developed firefly algorithm fa optimization technique is gaining research interest as several studies have reported a favourable enhancement in the accuracy of their modelling yaseen et al 2017 in comparison with other optimization approaches fa is more robust and reliable due to the possibility of simultaneously and effectively resolving both the global and local optima in the learning process of the ai models despite the robustness of the fa its application in evapotranspiration process prediction forecasting is yet to be explored hence and for the best knowledge of the authors this is the first implementation of the hybridized data intelligent model i e anfis fa for reference evapotranspiration over burkina faso region west africa the current research question is what is the potential of the hybrid anfis fa model to mimic the physical mechanism between the climatological information and reference evapotranspiration the developed hybrid intelligent model investigated over three different metrological stations characterized with diverse climatological features this is to explore the generalization capacity of the predictive model the finding of this research is very capital for the agricultural and irrigation prospective as an alternative modelling strategy and particularly within the context of africa where there is a serious problem in data monitoring and metrological data availability 2 case study and data description in this study three meteorological stations data daily time scale of bobo dioulasso bur dedougou and ouahigouya stations situated in the sudanian sahelian sudanian and sahelian of burkina faso respectively were used to build the hybrid intelligent model for evapotranspiration prediction fig 1 displays the location of the three stations the daily minimal and maximal temperature maximal relative humidity solar radiation wind speed and vapor pressure deficit between 1998 and 2012 with no gap collected from africa rice center were used as predictor variables table 1 shows the daily values of the predictor variables over the study period it can be seen that the bobo dioulasso station presents the lowest temperature maximal and minimal followed by bur dedougou and ouahigouya station respectively suggesting an increasing gradient of the temperature from sudanian to sahelian zone also it can be observed the same pattern for the relative humidity as well concerning the daily mean wind speed we have noticed an opposite trend bobo dioulasso 1 7 m s bur dedougou 1 5 m s and ouahigouya 1 1 m s it is worth to state the selection of the current region to be study due to the lack of reliable meteorological data monitoring in addition to have a detailed and comprehended vision of the predictability of soft computing models on this region 3 methodology 3 1 adaptive neuron fuzzy inference system anfis among several machine learning models anfis model which is based on fuzzy set theory applied in several multiple disciplinary field of science and engineering anfis combines fuzzy systems and the learning skill of neural networks cortés et al 2012 ho et al 2011 lohani et al 2012 three main types models of anfis are broadly recognized which are presenting in the following mamdani sugeno and tsumoto kaur and kaur 2012 mayilvaganan and naidu 2011 in general sugeon s model is the predominant used over the other types takagi and sugeno 1985 theoretically the membership function controls the input attributes of the fuzzy logic model çekmiş et al 2014 nodes and rules are represented the normal anfis architecture on the other hand the rules certificate the mimicking processes among the inputs and targeted output various types of mfs e g gaussian triangular trapezoidal used for training anfis model however in the current research gaussian mf is selected due to its flexibility awadallah et al 2009 mf u n i can be formulated as follows 1 u ni exp x c i 2 2 σ j 2 where x defines the input matrix at i and σj and ci are the provisional quantitative parameters the anfis model is subjected to the fuzzy based rules i e if then the rules are formulated as explained in eq 2 and 3 with two input variables and one output 2 rule 1 if x is p 1 and y is q 1 then f 1 p 1 x q 1 y r 1 3 rule 2 if x is p 2 and y is q 2 then f 2 p 2 x q 2 y r 2 p i and qi are fuzzy sets and fi represents the output within the fuzzy region p i q i and r i are the parameters used for designing the network training processes a general description of the anfis model is demonstrated in fig 2 a the modeled reference evapotranspiration problem is subjected to several hydrological and climatological factors and thus the nature of this problem is highly non linear and non stationary to solve this the anfis model is used perceptively in order to extract information and convert it to fuzzy systems the optimality of modelling anfis model relies on tuning the internal parameters i e σj and cj of the gaussian membership function hence new evolutionary nature inspired optimization algorithm called firefly optimization algorithm fa is adopted to determine the internal parameters of anfis membership function 3 2 hybrid model based on anfis fa the social behaviour of fireflies light flashing inspired the development of the firefly optimization algorithm fa yang 2010 the characteristic behaviour of the fireflies irrespective of their gender gave rise to three essential rules in the fa structure these rules are based on the fact that fireflies are presumed to be unisex with a distinctive attribute of attracting each order the rate of attraction of one firefly to the order depends on the intensity of the light flashed by the attracting firefly and the intensity of the light emitted by the fireflies is directly related to the amount of light it is emitting with regard to these stipulated rules the function of the fa model is related to the brightness and intensity of light emitted by the firefly equations 4 and 5 present the mathematical representation of the intensity and attractiveness of a firefly respectively the ability of any firefly to attract another firefly depends on its unique intensity β yang 2010 4 i i 0 e y r 2 5 w r w 0 e y r 2 where the light intensity is represented by i and attractiveness at a distance is represented by w r i 0 and w 0 represent the intensity of the emitted light and the attractiveness at a distance r 0 from the firefly y represents the light absorption coefficient eq 6 provides the distance r between any two fireflies i and j yang 2010 6 r i j x i x j k 1 d x i k x j k where x i and x j are the location of fireflies i and j in a cartesian coordinate system as mentioned firefly is attracted by another and vice versa thus the movement of firefly a by another firefly b is represented in eq 7 yang 2010 7 δ x i β 0 e y r 2 where α ε i and β 0 e y r 2 are the randomized and attraction terms respectively α ε i represents the randomization coefficient and random number vector respectively the value of α lies within 0 and 1 from eq 7 the movement of the next firefly is at its position i δ x i the optimal design of the anfis fa model requires the adjustment of some fa parameters such as the movement and light absorption coefficients α and γ respectively as well as the attraction coefficient base β0 the values of γ β0 and α in this paper were set at 1 1 8 and 0 5 respectively these values were determined after a series of trial and error processes the details of the fa procedure are provided by yang 2010 table 2 showed a series of input combinations put together based on the information obtained from metrological data all the input combinations were targeted at one response which is the reference evapotranspiration prior to the application of the anfis model the range of membership function mf parameters required for its optimization was defined during the training process the root mean square error rmse was determined and used as the yardstick for the monitoring of the accuracy of the anfis fa model during the proper optimization process the fa scheme was used to optimize the antecedent parameters of the anfis model consisting mainly of the mf parameters to initiate the first anfis fa iteration a generation of an initial population of firefly was randomly employed in a way that each firefly is represented in the anfis set s the light intensity of the fireflies was the basis for the computation of their degree of attractiveness thereby collectively comparing the attractiveness of the fireflies having compared the attractiveness of all the fireflies the particular firefly with the maximum brightness is selected and other fireflies are naturally attracted to it similarly the performance of the anfis fa was further evaluated by determining the rmse which is regarded as a fitness function in the hybrid model the anfis fa was continuously trained until either of a maximum number of iterations or an acceptable fitness function value is achieved the proposed flowchart of the hybrid anfis fa model is illustrated in fig 2b for appropriate data division 80 of the data were used to train the models and the remaining 20 for model testing for each of the three stations 3 3

discussion the capability of the new hybrid anfis fa model was evaluated to predict reference evapotranspiration using various input combinations anfis fa was verified against anfis based model fig 2a and b give the anfis structure and the flow chart serving the development of the hybrid anfis fa respectively six different input combinations corresponding to six models m1 m2 m6 defined in table 2 used to build the developed predictive models the combinations are m1 tmax m2 tmax and rs m3 tmax rhmax and rs m4 tmax tmin rhmax and rs m5 tmax tmin rhmax and rs u2 and m6 tmax tmin rhmax and rs u2 vpd the first input combination m1 includes only the maximum temperature owing to the fact that this climatological variable is the main trigger for the eto amount hargreaves and samani 1985 the developed hybrid anfis fa and the classical anfis models compared through the prediction skills using different statistic metrics eqs 9 17 including absolute error criteria best of goodness scatter

the daily predicted evapotranspiration by the applied models e t o c i and e t o p i are the mean values of the actual and predicted eto and n is the length of the data series the pertinence of using several statistic metrics justified by the fact that each metric summarizes a large number of data into a single value thus stressing only a certain aspect of the error characteristics of the model performance chai and draxler 2014 tables 3 5 tabulate the prediction performance of the classical anfis and the hybrid anfis fa predictive models over the testing phase for bobo dioulasso bur dedougou and ouahigouya respectively for bobo dioulasso station the rmse mae values ranged between 0 846 0 609 to 0 375 0 215 mm and 0 741 0 543 to 0 255 0 202 mm for anfis and anfis fa models respectively based on the tabulated results anfis fa model outclassed anfis based model with respect to si mape rmsre mre and bias metrics the best accuracy achieved for the sixth input combination m6 through including all the available climatological information whereas m1 that integrated only the daily maximum temperature attained the worst prediction results this is best can be explained due to the high correlation of the eto to multiple climate information note that every additive climatological variable enhances the prediction accuracy as clearly indicated using the rs m2 up the last variable vpd m6 with more reliable numerical presentation and for the anfis and anfis fa models respectively bobo dioulasso station achieves the si rmse values ranged between 0 159 0 062 0 846 0 329 and 0 139 0 045 0 740 0 242 mae bias values are ranged between 0 609 0 205 0 023 0 058 and 0 543 0 196 0 006 0 039 bur dedougou station attains the si rmse values are ranged between 0 149 0 061 0 827 0 343 and 0 143 0 043 0 799 0 240 respectively mae bias values ranged between 0 635 0 189 0 080 0 004 and 0 617 0 190 0 060 0 038 the third metrological station i e ouahigouya station presents the si rmse values are ranged between 0 208 0 096 1 123 0 519 and 0 205 0 074 1 106 0 401 mae bias values ranged between 0 907 0 297 0 292 0 155 and 0 891 0 319 0 210 0 040 what can be comprehended from these numerical results that the anfis fa model exhibits more reliable prediction accuracy and satisfies the base research question over all the three inspected metrological stations the anfis fa model attains the precise results and m6 input combination performed the best on the other hand the first input combination m1 gave the poorest results this is clearly indicating the necessity of initiating a monitoring station to maintain the data collection however the current available data perform an efficient intelligent predictive model by comparing the hybrid anfis fa with anfis results the proposed anfis fa model provides the best performance even though the similarity trend were observed when passing from one single input model to full climatic data information this fact is suggesting that more inputs data will increase the performance of the model from these results it can be drawn that the modelling is more accurate at the station of bur dedougou sudanian sahelian area and worst at ouahigouya station sahelian zone thus the climatic area influences the results of model simulation or prediction these results show obviously that modelling is site specific and depends on climate zone as mentioned by bodian et al 2016 lamine et al 2015 thus researchers and development agencies have to take precaution before generalizing model application it is worth to discuss the influence of the vpd in addition to the other variables of the sixth input combination in comparison with the individual maximum temperature information m1 for instance at bobo dioulasso there is a noticeable augmentation in the prediction precision presented by 67 for the root mean square error using the hybrid anfis fa model it is moderate percentage evidenced the variability of the vapor pressure deficit integrated with other variables as predictors for the eto the scatter plots of the optimal anfis and anfis fa models over the testing period for all stations presented in fig 3 the determination coefficient r2 and the slope of the different regressions are used to evaluate the agreement between the actual and predicted reference evapotranspiration results show the superiority of the anfis fa for all three stations r2 0 9661 0 9183 0 972 0 9159 and 0 9502 0 8783 for anfis fa anfis at bobo dioulasso bur dedougou and ouahigouya station respectively the slopes of the different regression equations exhibit also the same pattern suggesting the significance of the fa optimization algorithm for the anfis model optimization results indicate that estimates of hybrid anfis fa models closer to the manual calculation of penman monteith evapotranspiration and anfis fa superior to the classical anfis fig 4 displays the percentage of relative error distribution of predicting eto values the percentage errors depended on the model and location for the best model and location anfis fa model 6 at bobo dioulasso the absolute percentage error value found to be around 10 some higher absolute percentage error values noticed but not significant compared to the whole testing period when considering anfis m6 and the same location it can be noticed a more important percentage relative error exceeds 20 with several peak events reached 40 suggesting that anfis fa improved substantially the prediction of the reference evapotranspiration by reducing drastically the committed errors the same conclusions can be drawn to the other investigated metrological stations i e bur dedougou and ouahigouya in terms of the anfis fa superiority in giving less error when predicting eto further analysis taylor diagram td taylor 2001 is examined for the developed predictive models td uses standard deviation and the coefficient of correlation r of observed and simulated data to make classification the best model is the one with r 1 and presenting the same amplitude of variation than the observed data fig 5 presents the taylor diagrams for all investigated input combinations of anfis and anfis fa and for all stations bobo dioulasso bur dedougou and ouahigouya overall the integration of the nature inspired firefly optimizer with anfis improved substantially the performance of the modelling by increasing the best fit of goods and reducing the absolute error measurements the m6 gave the best results and over all the stations with remarkable modelling outcomes for bur dedougou station these findings confirmed the importance of all climate variables in predicting or computing the reference evapotranspiration each of the climate variables might impact positively or negatively the variation of evapotranspiration therefore efforts need to be made in order to monitor all climate variables in case of scarce data in this area the third input combination m3 gave an acceptable result and can be used as an alternative the applied modelling strategy gives a standard and reliable predictive model that can be used for the west africa area that can be extremely valuable for water management authorities over the past decade the classical anfis model was used to estimate the evaporation or reference evapotranspiration afterward certain hybrid anfis models wavelet anfis anfis sc anfis gp etc established to improve its modelling capability and results showed the improvement of results recently a novel optimizer method the firefly method used to improve the capability of artificial intelligent method and valuable results achieved for example ghorbani et al 2017 compared the traditional multilayer perceptron mlp and support vector machine svm models to the mlp fa for predicting pan evaporation in the north of iran they concluded that mlp fa model outperformed the classical mlp and svm models suggesting the role played by firefly method in optimizing results of the classical models this study as demonstrated by ghorbani et al 2017 confirms the power of the firefly method to improve the accuracy of the ai modelling 5 conclusion prediction of reference evapotranspiration for better evaluation of crop water needs is a remarkable responsibility for agriculture and irrigation engineers and agronomist thus providing and exploring a robust intelligent model to increase the accuracy of classical models is the passionate of the new trend researches in this research a new adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system integrated with firefly optimization algorithm was developed and tested for the prediction of reference evapotranspiration in burkina faso region west africa data of three climatic stations bobo dioulasso bur dedougou and ouahigouya was utilized to build the hybrid predictive model anfis fa and the benchmark model various input combinations including maximum temperature minimum temperature maximum relative humidity solar radiation wind speed and vapor pressure deficit were considered in this study based on these variables six models were defined to establish the forgoing predictive models the most accurate results were achieved by using all of the variables as input combination for both anfis fa and anfis this is best can be explained due to the complexity pattern on the eto that required informative attributes furthermore the results corroborated the superiority of the anfis fa model compared with the classical anfis model and showed the potential value of an integrated anfis firefly optimized model to improve the capability of the anfis based model significantly the results of this study showed that the performance of the modelling depends on climate zone therefore similar studies in other regions of varying climatic conditions need to be explored in order to reinforce the finding of this study furthermore the implemented hybrid model for the eto prediction exhibited the motivation to explore on other climatological and agricultural processes such as temperature solar radiation and crops productivity prediction 
11368,reference evapotranspiration eto is one of the major components of the hydrological cycle that is very essential in water resources planning irrigation and drainage management and several other hydrology processes in irrigation system and design the prediction of eto is vital and indispensable for the quantification of crop water needs this study investigates the capabilities of hybridized

in sahelian sudano sahelian and sudanian zone are used for modelling development six different climatic input variable combinations corresponding to 6 models are inspected the daily penman monteith reference evapotranspiration for the time period 1998 2012 are used to train and test the models several numerical indicators in addition to taylor diagram are considered to evaluate the performance of the models results indicated that the hybrid anfis fa model outperformed the classical anfis based model for all three stations and the model with full inputs climatic data gave the best results furthermore anfis fa is performed the best for bur dedougou sahalian soudanian region and less at ouahigouya sahalian region in quantitative terms and for instance bur dedougou station anfis fa model increased the prediction accuracy remarkably si 0 043 r2 0 97 mape 0 035 and rmse 0 24 compared with anfis based model si 0 068 r2 0 89 mape 0 037 and rmse 0 378 results revealed the influence of utilizing nature inspired firefly algorithm to substantially improve performance of the classical anfis model optimization for the applied application also the applied modelling strategy can bring a

accurate prediction could be achieved through a combination of energy balance aerodynamics they approved the fao penman monteith p m equation as the standard equation for eto estimation penman 1948 in the last two decades the application of soft computing models such as artificial intelligent ai models have been proposed to be implemented and solve this hydrological process abdullah et al 2015 fahimi et al 2016 ai models are a programming technique mimics the biological brain nerve cells neurons performance in terms of interaction ai models have been evidenced their capabilities in a wide range of application of science and engineering fields the increase in science studies necessitated the development of mathematical models for handling the enormous volume of natural and artificial phenomena different categories of ai models such as artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm fuzzy logic fl and evolutionary computing ec approaches have been successfully used and are now seen as the best techniques of handling several scientific tasks of hydrology such as optimization modelling forecasting and prediction nourani et al 2014 yaseen et al 2015b the implementation of ai models is based on training validation and testing methodology the training stage involves the optimal parameter determination which proceeds mainly in a similar way continues until the minimum error and norm weights are attained the validation stage is accomplished during the training process to overcome the overfitting issues the performance of the testing phase is regarded as the major process where the models are tested in terms of meeting predefined modelling objectives the popularity of ai models in scientific research has been evolved massively during this course of study and yet more researches attention is being directed towards including hydrological studies adeloye et al 2012 kumar et al 2011 naoum and tsanis 2003 the efficiency of the ai models have been verified in

kisi 2008 based on the latest review research of ai based eto modelling the semantic based neural architecture has achieved a high level of accuracy for eto modelling with respect to the forecasting

abyaneh et al 2011 baba et al 2013 cai et al 2004 citakoglu et al 2014 cobaner 2011 karimaldini et al 2012 kisi et al 2015 ladlani et al 2014 patil and deka 2017 shiri et al 2012 tabari et al 2012 the anfis model has the potential of integrating the advantage of the fuzzy features in parallel with adaptive neural network system in processing non linear and uncertainty problem jang 1993 the anfis based model can benefit from the ability of the fuzzy logic system in handling the vagueness and imprecision in the predictor data set however anfis model was demonstrated some limitations due to the internal parameter optimization tuning hence integrating this model with natural inspired algorithm is the innovation solution to overcome these limitations most recently the performance of hybrid systems has been enhanced in terms of precision for modelling hydrological and climatological application due to the integration of the good attributes of the components models into the hybrid model fahimi et al 2016 the integration of several optimization algorithms in eto modelling through embedment into a standalone ai based model has improved the performance of the models as it allowed the deduction of the optimal solution for an estimation problem and parallelly reduced the time of computation ghorbani et al 2017 much attention has been given to the nature inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithms enabling them to enhance the performance of other standalone ai models yang 2010 several wrapper types of nature inspired optimization algorithms evidenced to enhance the predictability performance abdullah et al 2014 gromov and shulga 2012 sudheer et al 2013 the recently developed firefly algorithm fa optimization technique is gaining research interest as several studies have reported a favourable enhancement in the accuracy of their modelling yaseen et al 2017 in comparison with other optimization approaches fa is more robust and reliable due to the possibility of simultaneously and effectively resolving both the global and local optima in the learning process of the ai models despite the robustness of the fa its application in evapotranspiration process prediction forecasting is yet to be explored hence and for the best knowledge of the authors this is the first implementation of the hybridized data intelligent model i e anfis fa for reference evapotranspiration over burkina faso region west africa the current research question is what is the potential of the hybrid anfis fa model to mimic the physical mechanism between the climatological information and reference evapotranspiration the developed hybrid intelligent model investigated over three different metrological stations characterized with diverse climatological

factors and thus the nature of this problem is highly non linear and non stationary to solve this the anfis model is used perceptively in order to extract information and convert it to fuzzy systems the optimality of modelling anfis model relies on tuning the internal parameters i e σj and cj of the gaussian membership function hence new evolutionary nature inspired optimization algorithm called firefly optimization algorithm fa is adopted to determine the internal parameters of anfis membership function 3 2 hybrid model based on anfis fa the social behaviour of fireflies light flashing inspired the development of the firefly optimization algorithm fa yang 2010 the characteristic behaviour of the fireflies irrespective of their gender gave rise to three essential rules in the fa structure these rules are based on the fact that fireflies are presumed to be unisex with a distinctive attribute of attracting each order the rate of attraction of one firefly to the order depends on the intensity of the light flashed by the attracting firefly and the intensity of the light emitted by the fireflies is directly related to the amount of light it is emitting with regard to these stipulated rules the function of the fa model is related to the brightness and intensity of light emitted by the firefly equations 4 and 5 present the mathematical representation of the intensity and attractiveness of a firefly respectively the ability of any firefly to attract another firefly depends on its unique intensity β yang 2010 4 i i 0 e y r 2 5 w r w 0 e y r 2 where the light intensity is represented by i and attractiveness at a distance is represented by w r i 0 and w 0 represent the intensity of the emitted light and the attractiveness at a distance r 0 from the firefly y represents the light absorption coefficient eq 6 provides the distance r between any two fireflies i and j yang 2010 6 r i j x i x j k 1 d x i k x j k where x i and x j are the location of fireflies i and j in a cartesian coordinate system as mentioned firefly is attracted by another and vice versa thus the movement of firefly a by another firefly b is represented in eq 7 yang 2010 7 δ x i β 0 e y r 2 where α ε i and β 0 e y r 2 are the randomized and attraction terms respectively α ε i represents the randomization coefficient and random number vector respectively the value of α lies within 0 and 1 from eq 7 the movement of the next firefly is at its position i δ x i the optimal design of the anfis fa model requires the adjustment of some fa parameters such as the movement and light absorption coefficients α and γ respectively as well as the attraction coefficient base β0 the values of γ β0 and α in this paper were set at 1 1 8 and 0 5 respectively these values were determined after a series of trial and error processes the details of the fa procedure are provided by yang 2010 table 2 showed a series of input combinations put together based on the information obtained from metrological data all the input combinations were targeted at one response which is the reference evapotranspiration prior to the application of the anfis model the range of membership function mf parameters required for its optimization was defined during the training process the root mean square error rmse was determined and used as the yardstick for the monitoring of the accuracy of the anfis fa model during the proper optimization process the fa scheme was used to optimize the antecedent parameters of the anfis model consisting mainly of the mf parameters to initiate the first anfis fa iteration a generation of an initial population of firefly was randomly employed in a way that each firefly is represented in the anfis set s the light intensity of the fireflies was the basis for the computation of their degree of attractiveness thereby collectively comparing the attractiveness of the fireflies having compared the attractiveness of all the fireflies the particular firefly with the maximum brightness is selected and other fireflies are naturally attracted to it similarly the performance of the anfis fa was further evaluated by determining the rmse which is regarded as a fitness function in the hybrid model the anfis fa was continuously trained until either of a maximum number of iterations or an acceptable fitness function value is achieved the proposed flowchart of the hybrid anfis fa model is illustrated in fig 2b for appropriate data division 80 of the data were used to train the models and the remaining 20 for model testing for each of the three stations 3 3

discussion the capability of the new hybrid anfis fa model was evaluated to predict reference evapotranspiration using various input combinations anfis fa was verified against anfis based model fig 2a and b give the anfis structure and the flow chart serving the development of the hybrid anfis fa respectively six different input combinations corresponding to six models m1 m2 m6 defined in table 2 used to build the developed predictive models the combinations are m1 tmax m2 tmax and rs m3 tmax rhmax and rs m4 tmax tmin rhmax and rs m5 tmax tmin rhmax and rs u2 and m6 tmax tmin rhmax and rs u2 vpd the first input combination m1 includes only the maximum temperature owing to the fact that this climatological variable is the main trigger for the eto amount hargreaves and samani 1985 the

the daily predicted evapotranspiration by the applied models e t o c i and e t o p i are the mean values of the actual and predicted eto and n is the length of the data series the pertinence of using several statistic metrics justified by the fact that each metric summarizes a large number of data into a single value thus stressing only a certain aspect of the error characteristics of the model performance chai and draxler 2014 tables 3 5 tabulate the prediction performance of the classical anfis and the hybrid anfis fa predictive models over the testing phase for bobo dioulasso bur dedougou and ouahigouya respectively for bobo dioulasso station the rmse mae values ranged between 0 846 0 609 to 0 375 0 215 mm and 0 741 0 543 to 0 255 0 202 mm for anfis and anfis fa models respectively based on the tabulated results anfis fa model outclassed anfis based model with respect to si mape rmsre mre and bias metrics the best accuracy achieved for the sixth input combination m6 through including all the available climatological information whereas m1 that integrated only the daily maximum temperature attained the worst prediction results this is best can be explained due to the high correlation of the eto to multiple climate information note that every additive climatological variable enhances the prediction accuracy as clearly indicated using the rs m2 up the last variable vpd m6 with more reliable numerical presentation and for the anfis and anfis fa models respectively bobo dioulasso station achieves the si rmse values ranged between 0 159 0 062 0 846 0 329 and 0 139 0 045 0 740 0 242 mae bias values are ranged between 0 609 0 205 0 023 0 058 and 0 543 0 196 0 006 0 039 bur dedougou station attains the si rmse values are ranged between 0 149 0 061 0 827 0 343 and 0 143 0 043 0 799 0 240 respectively mae bias values ranged between 0 635 0 189 0 080 0 004 and 0 617 0 190 0 060 0 038 the third metrological station i e ouahigouya station presents the si rmse values are ranged between 0 208 0 096 1 123 0 519 and 0 205 0 074 1 106 0 401 mae bias values ranged between 0 907 0 297 0 292 0 155 and 0 891 0 319 0 210 0 040 what can be comprehended from these numerical results that the anfis fa model exhibits more reliable prediction accuracy and satisfies the base research question over all the three inspected metrological stations the anfis fa model attains the precise results and m6 input combination performed the best on the other hand the first input combination m1 gave the poorest results this is clearly indicating the necessity of initiating a monitoring station to maintain the data collection however the current available data perform an efficient intelligent predictive model by comparing the hybrid anfis fa with anfis results the proposed anfis fa model provides the best performance even though the similarity trend were observed when passing from one single input model to full climatic data information this fact is suggesting that more inputs data will increase the performance of the model from these results it can be drawn that the modelling is more accurate at the station of bur dedougou sudanian sahelian area and worst at ouahigouya station sahelian zone thus the climatic area influences the results of model simulation or prediction these results show obviously that modelling is site specific and depends on climate zone as mentioned by bodian et al 2016 lamine et al 2015 thus researchers and development agencies have to take precaution before generalizing model application it is worth to discuss the influence of the vpd in addition to the other variables of the sixth input combination in comparison with the individual maximum temperature information m1 for instance at bobo dioulasso there is a noticeable augmentation in the prediction precision presented by 67 for the root mean square error using the hybrid anfis fa model it is moderate percentage evidenced the variability of the vapor pressure deficit integrated with other variables as predictors for the eto the scatter plots of the optimal anfis and anfis fa models over the testing period for all stations presented in fig 3 the determination coefficient r2 and the slope of the different regressions are used to evaluate the agreement between the actual and predicted reference evapotranspiration results show the superiority of the anfis fa for all three stations r2 0 9661 0 9183 0 972 0 9159 and 0 9502 0 8783 for anfis fa anfis at bobo dioulasso bur dedougou and ouahigouya station respectively the slopes of the different regression equations exhibit also the same pattern suggesting the significance of the fa optimization algorithm for the anfis model optimization results indicate that estimates of hybrid anfis fa models closer to the manual calculation of penman monteith evapotranspiration and anfis fa superior to the classical anfis fig 4 displays the percentage of relative error distribution of predicting eto values the percentage errors depended on the model and location for the best model and location anfis fa model 6 at bobo dioulasso the absolute percentage error value found to be around 10 some higher absolute percentage error values noticed but not significant compared to the whole testing period when considering anfis m6 and the same location it can be noticed a more important percentage relative error exceeds 20 with several peak events reached 40 suggesting that anfis fa improved substantially the prediction of the reference evapotranspiration by reducing drastically the committed errors the same conclusions can be drawn to the other investigated metrological stations i e bur dedougou and ouahigouya in terms of the anfis fa superiority in giving less error when predicting eto further analysis taylor diagram td taylor 2001 is examined for the developed predictive models td uses standard deviation and the coefficient of correlation r of observed and simulated data to make classification the best model is the one with r 1 and presenting the same amplitude of variation than the observed data fig 5 presents the taylor diagrams for all investigated input combinations of anfis and anfis fa and for all stations bobo dioulasso bur dedougou and ouahigouya overall the integration of the nature inspired firefly optimizer with anfis improved substantially the performance of the modelling by increasing the best fit of goods and reducing the absolute error measurements the m6 gave the best results and over all the stations with remarkable modelling outcomes for bur dedougou station these findings confirmed the importance of all climate variables in predicting or computing the reference evapotranspiration each of the climate variables might impact positively or negatively the variation of evapotranspiration therefore efforts need to be made in order to monitor all climate variables in case of scarce data in this area the third input combination m3 gave an acceptable result and can be used as an alternative the applied modelling strategy gives a standard and reliable predictive model that can be used for the west africa area that can be extremely valuable for water management authorities over the past decade the classical anfis model was used to estimate the evaporation or reference evapotranspiration afterward certain hybrid anfis models wavelet anfis anfis sc anfis gp etc established to improve its modelling capability and results showed the improvement of results recently a novel optimizer method the firefly method used to improve the capability of artificial intelligent method and valuable results achieved for example ghorbani et al 2017 compared the traditional multilayer perceptron mlp and support vector machine svm models to the mlp fa for predicting pan evaporation in the north of iran they concluded that mlp fa model outperformed the classical mlp and svm models suggesting the role played by firefly method in optimizing results of the classical models this study as demonstrated by ghorbani et al 2017 confirms the power of the firefly method to improve the accuracy of the ai modelling 5 conclusion prediction of reference evapotranspiration for better evaluation of crop water needs is a remarkable responsibility for agriculture and irrigation engineers and agronomist thus providing and exploring a robust intelligent model to increase the accuracy of classical models is the passionate of the new trend researches in this research a new adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system integrated with firefly optimization algorithm was developed and tested for the prediction of reference evapotranspiration in burkina faso region west africa data of three climatic stations bobo dioulasso bur dedougou and ouahigouya was utilized to build the hybrid predictive model anfis fa and the benchmark model various input combinations including maximum temperature minimum temperature maximum relative humidity solar radiation wind speed and vapor pressure deficit were considered in this study based on these variables six models were defined to establish the forgoing predictive models the most accurate results were achieved by using all of the variables as input combination for both anfis fa and anfis this is best can be explained due to the complexity pattern on the eto that required informative attributes furthermore the results corroborated the superiority of the anfis fa model compared with the classical anfis model and showed the potential value of an integrated anfis firefly optimized model to improve the capability of the anfis based model significantly the results of this study showed that the performance of the modelling depends on climate zone therefore similar studies in other regions of varying climatic conditions need to be explored in order to reinforce the finding of this study furthermore the implemented hybrid model for the eto prediction exhibited the motivation to explore on other climatological and agricultural processes such as temperature solar radiation and crops productivity prediction 
11369,almond prunnus dulcis mill has been traditionally associated to marginal land cultivation and rain fed agriculture in south spain however in the last years this crop is being progressively introduced in more productive agricultural areas within the guadalquivir river basin where the available water resources are not enough to satisfy the adequate crop water requirements considering this limitation a more precise irrigation scheduling to maximize the yield is required infrared thermal imaging emerges as alternative to other traditional methodologies to assess the crop water status especially when deficit irrigation di strategies are being applied the aim of this study was to define the methodology to assess the almond water status by means of thermal information the trial was conducted during 2014 during the kernel filling period in an almond experimental orchard sw spain with 5 year old trees subjected to three irrigation regimes i a full irrigation treatment c 100 which received 100 of etc ii a regulated deficit irrigation rdi 50 which received 100 of etc except during the kernel filling period when this treatment was irrigated with 50 of etc iii and a low frequency deficit irrigation treatment lfdi which received 100 of etc except during the kernel filling period when it was subjected to continuous periods of irrigation restriction defined in terms of the threshold values of shaded leaf water potential ψ leaf three daily curves of canopy temperature t c stomatal conductance to water vapour g s and ψ leaf with measurements at 8 00 11 00 14 00 17 00 and 20 00 were developed additionally crop water stress index cwsi temperature difference between canopy and the surrounding air δt canopy air and the relative index to stomatal conductance i g obtained at different scales canopy and row were estimated significant correlations of infrared thermal information vs ψ leaf and g s were obtained p 0 05 and p 0 01 in particular by using the thermal readings taken at 11 30 14 30 at 17 30 h especially robust were the relationships obtained between t c and cwsi with ψ leaf at 11 30 h and between t c and cwsi with g s and ψ leaf at 14 30 h finally considering the infrared thermal monitoring procedure readings at tree and row level similar values of t c were obtained and therefore the images taken at row level offered a better information with a higher feasibility in terms of image processing keywords thermography thermal indexes water stress leaf gas exchange and leaf water potential 1 introduction irrigated agriculture in the south of europe and more concretely in semi arid areas such as andalusia s spain is crucial for their development especially in those rural regions with a lower economic potential in this line for the case of andalusia irrigated agriculture generates more than 60 of rural employments and represents 64 of agricultural production currently 1 176 000 ha are devoted to irrigated agriculture corresponding to 24 of total andalusian agricultural surface and this being 33 of the irrigated agriculture in spain ara 2011 climatic conditions in this area are characterized by the scarcity and irregularity of rainfall coinciding the dry period with the season of highest evapotranspiration moreover the last forecast predictions argue significant water resources depletions with an important declining in the soil water reserves more accused periods of rainfall restrictions and increasing in the average temperatures ipcc 2014 in this agreement it is expected that this situation promotes an imbalance between the irrigation demand and the available water resources in the mediterranean agriculture daccache et al 2012 olesen et al 2011 this fact will suppose an important constraint for the competitiveness between agriculture and other more productive sectors such as the industry or tourism in addition the introduction of alternative crops in order to maximize the profitability of agroecosystems will be required together with different strategies to improve the agricultural water management garcía tejero et al 2014a in this context almond prunus dulcis mill is the third crop in terms of surface in spain representing globally almost 40 and 84 within the eu however only 5 of the global production is developed in spain faostat 2016 concretely the surface of almond in andalusia is about 152 000 ha and within them 95 are associated to marginal and rain fed agriculture because of the climate limitations where annual rainfalls does not exceed of 300 mm with low nut yields capdr 2016 however in the last few years the agricultural surface devoted to almond crop has significant increased specially in areas where this crop was not traditionally cultivated these new orchards being cultivated under intensive and irrigation practices thus almond can be found under very different agricultural systems from the most marginal situations to the most intensive orchards which promotes a wide range of yields from 150 to 2600 kg ha 1 capdr 2016 according to goldhamer and fereres 2016 irrigation is the most limiting factor for this crop with crop water requirements oscillating between 900 and 1350 mm goldhamer and girona 2012 in this agreement goldhamer and fereres 2016 reported values close to 4000 kg ha 1 depending on the cultivar for irrigation doses around 1250 mm with yield reductions close to 14 when the irrigation doses were close to 1000 mm more recently lópez lópez et al 2018 in a long term experience developed in the province of córdoba andalusia south spain reported maximum yield values 2500 kg ha 1 in mature almond trees cv guara when these trees were irrigated receiving the maximum crop water requirements close to 10 000 m3 ha 1 in spite of this almond is considered a drought resistant crop because of its xeromorphic properties torrecillas et al 1996 and many authors have reported different results related to the effects of deficit irrigation di strategies puerto et al 2013 phogat et al 2017 spinelli et al 2016 among others more recently lópez lópez et al 2018 discussed the effects of water deficits in almond trees in terms of water use evaluating different deficit irrigation di strategies during three consecutive years these authors found that almond trees under different moderate di strategies were able of keeping canopy volumes similar to those trees that were fully irrigated these being directly related with the almond capability to obtain yield values under moderate deficit irrigation similar to those reported by fully irrigated trees this fact being accompanied with similar soil water depletions and transpiration level taking into account the maximum crop water demand the water scarcity in semi arid areas and the proper response of this crop to moderate water stress di would be a suitable alternative to reach equilibrium between the available water resources and a proper crop development with final yields able to ensure the competitiveness and feasibility of this crop garcía tejero et al 2016a however the application of di strategies requires a proper knowledge about the crop physiological status with the aim of ensuring the correct crop development without significant compromising the yield and fruit quality especially when water stress is applied in different crop stages spinelli et al 2016 in this sense according to puerto et al 2013 when a di strategy is applied in fruit trees this is mainly developed supplying a specific water withholding taken as reference the crop water requirements by means of the crop evapotranspiration etc without taking into account the effects of canopy architecture the degree of canopy cover or the soil management among others or without considering the crop physiological status when this water stress is applied in this regard the most proper irrigation scheduling should consider the whole of soil plant atmosphere system although in terms or representativeness the live component plant would be offering the most valuable information inasmuch as this reflects the most integrative information mainly in terms of final yield traditionally crop water monitoring has been developed by using punctual measurements of stem ψ stem or leaf ψ leaf water potential at midday or pre dawn ψ pd shackel 2011 nortes et al 2005 or monitoring the gas exchange parameters such as transpiration e stomatal conductance g s or net photosynthetic rate a gomes laranjo et al 2006 according to remorini and massai 2003 ψstem is not only a proper indicator of plant water status as well as the crop productivity in the same vein mirás avalos et al 2016 reported that water potential is a suitable indicator of almond water status although its usefulness is reduced because of a minimum number of replications are required and the representativeness in the whole plant is reduced in the last years the use of remote sensing in agriculture and more concretely infrared thermal imaging to monitor the crop water status has been progressively introduced costa et al 2013 this technique has been properly described as a good methodology for crop water monitoring in different woody crops such as citrus garcía tejero et al 2011 gonzalez dugo et al 2014 young almonds garcía tejero et al 2012 vines garcía tejero et al 2016b or olives egea et al 2017 this technique is based on the leaf energy balance when a water stress situation is applied plants responds with a partial stomatal closure reducing the stomatal conductance limiting the leaf transpiration and promoting an attenuation of the evaporative cooling process resulting in higher leaf canopy temperature values jones 1999 2004 this technique can be applied at different monitoring scales from leaf or canopy to orchard or basin level poblete echeverría et al 2014 2016 the selection of the most proper methodology will be related with the desired goal and the economic availability costa et al 2013 in this sense the use of thermography at orchard scale by using satellites images allows to take decisions related to crop variability or irrigation scheduling but some constraints must be taken into account on one hand thermal images taking by satellites have the difficulty of depending of the moment in which the satellite passes above the orchard and on the other hand the spatial and spectral resolution is not proper these constraints could be solved by using of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs despite its economically restrictions in this sense the use of thermal images at orchard scale taken by means of uavs requires having the proper technology and this fact can increase the cost of this tool becoming less accessible the use of this technology by the contrast these sensors can be used at plant level with thermal cameras much more profitable easing the accessibility to this technique by the irrigation communities or technicians likewise the main constraints of this technique are focused in the image processing many times requiring high time consuming and the correct interpretation of the infrared thermal information garcía tejero et al 2015a because of this many times different relationships between infrared thermal information and other physiological parameters such as g s a e or ψ stem are required jones 2004 jones et al 2009 although these relationships are not always enough robust because of the high dependence of the meteorological conditions jones 1999 2004 the monitoring proceedings costa et al 2013 the cultivar costa et al 2012 garcía tejero et al 2016b or even the crop phenological stage cohen et al 2015 up to day several authors have developed strategies to optimize this technique developing different protocols and strategies to take thermal readings under field conditions jones et al 2009 pou et al 2014 poblete echeverría et al 2014 2016 garcía tejero et al 2012 2016b and describing different relationships between infrared thermal information and physiological parameters we hypothesize that thermography could be a suitable technique to monitor almond water status especially when this is subjected to di programs the aim of the present work was to evaluate the performance of thermography under field conditions at two monitoring levels plant and row to assess the crop water status in almond trees cv guara determining the best moment of the day to obtain the thermal information and the most robust thermal index to interpret properly the crop water status 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site the trial was

in 2009 the trees were spaced 6 7 m and drip irrigated using two pipe lines with emitters of 2 3 l h 1 and 14 emitters per tree the soil is silty loam typical fluvisol usda 2010 2 5 m deep fertile and

soil water content values at field capacity 0 033 mpa and wilting point 1 5 mpa were 0 35 and 0 12 m3 m 3 respectively with an allowable soil water depletion level of 0 27 m3 m 3 the climatology in the study area is attenuated meso mediterranean with an annual et0 rate of 1400 mm and accumulated rainfall of 540 mm mainly distributed from october to april 2 2 irrigation treatments three irrigation treatments were applied i a full irrigated treatment c 100 which received 100 of the crop evapotranspiration et c during the irrigation period 60 304 day of the year doy ii a regulated deficit irrigation rdi 50 which received 100 of etc except during the kernel filling period and pre harvest when this treatment was irrigated at 50 of etc according to this the kernel filling period took place from 171 to 227 doy and pre harvest from 228 to 243 doy this period coinciding with the time in which the kernel has finished its growth and the nut split period begins just before the irrigation withholding 250 doy seven days before the harvesting 257 doy iii and a low frequency deficit irrigation lfdi which received the 100 et c during the irrigation period except during the kernel filling stage and pre harvest when this treatment was irrigated according the registered values of ψ leaf measured in shaded leaves in this sense during the kernel filling period from 171 to 227 doy this treatment was subjected to irrigation restriction cycles with the following irrigation dynamic once started the kernel filling period irrigation was supressed till reaching values of ψ leaf close to 2 0 mpa then trees were re watered with the same periodicity and amount of water as c 100 approximately during 5 7 days till reaching similar values of ψ leaf to those registered in c 100 once this threshold value was reached this treatment was subjected to a new restriction period until the threshold of ψ leaf 2 0 mpa was again surpassed this dynamic of irrigation restriction cycles was maintained during whole stage of kernel filling period until harvesting irrigation doses were calculated according to the methodology proposed by allen et al 1998 obtaining the values of reference evapotranspiration according to the penman monteith equation by using a weather station installed in the same experimental orchard and using the crop coefficients obtained by garcía tejero et al 2015b which ranged between 0 6 and 1 2 according to this irrigation doses applied to c 100 rdi 50 and lfdi were 6 850 4 400 and 4 180 m3 ha 1 respectively table 1 2 3 plant measurements during the experimental period three daily curves of canopy temperature tc stomatal conductance to water vapour gs and leaf water potential ψleaf were obtained during the kernel filling and pre harvest period these readings were taken at 08 30 11 30 14 30 17 30 and 20 00 h local time during the days 29th july curve 1 210 doy 5th august curve 2 217 doy and 27th august curve 3 239 doy these days coincided with the irrigation restriction periods of lfdi with the aim of registering the crop physiological status during periods of maximum water stress in this treatment in this sense curve 2 was developed a week after curve 1 the reason was that when curve 1 was developed lfdi has been subjected to seven days of irrigation restriction taking into account the obtained results during this curve it was decided to extend this period once more week in order to register the crop physiological response under a situation of maximum stress finally between curve 2 and 3 there was a recovery period from 218 to 225 doy being the curve 3 developed after 14 days without irrigation in similar conditions at curve 2 table 2 shows the values of air temperature tair relative humidity rh and vapour pressure deficit vpd registered during the sampling days and for each monitoring hour measurements of ψ leaf were conducted by using a pressure chamber soil moisture equipment corp sta barbara ca usa monitoring 12 trees per irrigation treatment one leaf per tree located in the north side of the tree and being totally mature fresh and shaded at 1 5 m of height approximately additionally the stomatal conductance to water vapor g s was measured in these same trees by using a porometer sc 1 decagon devices inc wa usa on one leaf completely exposed to the sun per monitored tree and at 1 5 m

each pixel corresponds to an effective temperature reading jones 2004 two methodologies were tested to monitor the canopy temperature i 12 images were taken at tree level one image per tree assessed thee being the same trees in which the measurements of ψ leaf and g s were developed for each daily curve treatment and moment of the day and ii during curves 1 and 2 thermal images were taken at row level so that the trees monitored in the same image were subjected to the same irrigation treatment fig 1 these images at tree level were taken in the sunlit side of the trees with the imager placed at 2 m of the canopy fig 1 background temperature was determined by measuring the temperature of a crumpled sheet of aluminium foil placed close to the leaves of interest using ε 1 jones et al 2002 to facilitate the further analysis of these images a cooled white screen was used as background this being placed behind of each monitored tree to simplify the isolation of the canopy surface through image processing thermal images at tree level were analysed with the software developed by garcía tejero et al 2012 this software allows to remove those areas or pixels considered stem and the background fig 2 for the case of the images taken at row level these were analysed using the software thermacam research pro flir systems usa selecting a specific area on the left and on the right and obtaining the average value of tc for each area fig 3 this methodology is much faster than the previous described by garcía tejero et al 2012 although it does not discriminates the representative areas with the same feasibility and the areas selection is done according to the visual perspective of the operator considering the tc values obtained at tree level three different thermal indicators were calculated the difference between canopy and the surrounding air δt canopy air the crop water stress index cwsi and the index of the relative stomatal conductance these being calculated as follows costa et al 2013 1 δtcanopy air tc tair 2 c w s i δ t c a n o p y a i r δ t w e t δ t d r y δ t w e t 3 i g δ t d r y δ t c a n o p y a i r δ t c a n o p y a i r δ t w e t where δt canopy air δt dry and δt wet are the differences between canopy and air temperature for the crop in the moment of the measurement when the crop has the stomata fully closed and when it is fully transpiring respectively tc is the canopy temperature and tair the temperature of the surrounding air to obtain the reference values of δtwet there was estimated the non water stress baseline δtcanopy air a b vpd according to idso et al 1981 using a δt dry value equal to 5 c as it was proposed by jackson et al 1981 non water stress baseline was estimated using the canopy temperature readings obtained from full irrigated trees c 100 2 4 experimental design and statistical analysis the experimental design was of randomized blocks with four replications per irrigation treatment each replication had 15 trees 3 rows and 5 trees per row being monitored the three central rows for each replication n 12 for each measurement day an exploratory descriptive analysis of data ψ leaf g s and t c was conducted by applying a levene s test to check the variance homogeneity of the studied variables significant differences between irrigation treatments p 0 05 in the studied variables were identified by applying a one way anova and a tukey s test for treatment separation with the spss statistical software spss inc 15 0 statistical package chicago il usa to evaluate the non water stress baselines a linear correlation analysis was made n 15 to evaluate the relationships between variables a linear correlation analysis between the values of thermal indicators t c δt canopy air cwsi and i g and the crop physiological variables ψ leaf and g s was made by using the average values for each treatment and sampling time n 9 the obtained correlation coefficients were used to identify which would be the best time to carry out t c readings and the most representative thermal index as a proxy for crop physiology traits finally comparative study between the t c readings taken at tree and row level was conducted by means of a linear correlation analysis between these values using the average values for each treatment and the whole data obtained during the two first daily curves n 30 3 results and discussion 3 1 daily evolution of crop physiological status fig 4 shows the evolution of ψ leaf g s and t c measured at tree level during the three daily curves developed during the irrigation period in which the water stress regimes were imposed on overall as the climatic conditions along the day became more adverse ψ leaf reached more negative values with a final recovery at the end of the day by contrast g s increased during the first readings until reaching a maximum point in which a significant decrease was observed this coinciding with the moment of the day in which the climatic conditions were more extreme after this point a slight recovery of g s was found with the last measurements of the day in relation to tc this variable showed a more dependent trend on the climatic conditions along the day reaching the maximum values in those moments in which the t air values were the highest during curves 1 and 2 the lowest values of ψ leaf were reached at 17 30 h coinciding with the highest vpd values registered during these days and with the moments in which the t c values were maximum considering the obtained values for each treatment no differences were observed at 8 30 h but these were appearing along the day without observing a total recovery between the di treatments and c 100 at 20 00 h it is remarkable that the observed differences in terms of ψ leaf were higher during the curve 2 this being associated with the more severe climatic conditions detected and the imposed water restriction period for lfdi in this curve which had been prolonged for a further seven days in comparison to curve 1 regarding to g s during curve 1 all the treatments showed a growing tendency reaching the maximum values at 14 30 h vpd 2 61 kpa however during the curve 2 the maximum values were observed at 11 30 h vpd 1 82 from which g s decreased showing a partial recovering in c 100 at the end of the day this difference observed for the case of g s could be associated with the more severe climatic conditions registered during the curve 2 in comparison to the previous one finally it is noticeable that the depletion in t c was accompanied with a slight recovery of gs and the slight recovery of ψ leaf and g s during the readings at 20 00 h regarding to the values obtained during the curve 3 it was obtained three weeks after curve 2 when climate conditions were similar to those observed in the previous one and lfdi was subjected to 15 days of irrigation restriction in this sense it was observed a similar trend to that detected in curve 2 with the highest values of g s observed at 11 30 vpd 1 31 kpa with a significant reduction in all the treatments at 14 30 h followed by a partial recovery at 17 30 h and a new descend at the end of the day this decreasing trend occurred at 14 30 h being this response associated with a partial stomatal closure when climatic conditions specially the vpd values are strongly elevated even more this descend in the values of g s promoted that the readings of ψ leaf between 11 30 and 14 30 were similar and the partial recovery of g s at 17 30 was accompanied with a significant lessen values of ψ leaf relating to the t c readings these were highly determined by the climatic conditions on overall t c readings in the three studied treatments were below to air temperature t air except the readings taken at 08 30 and 11 30 h for the curves 2 and 3 the highest differences in t c between treatments were detected specially in the readings taken at 11 30 14 30 and 17 00 although these were not as patent as for the case of ψ leaf on overall and taking into account the monitored physiological variables it can be assumed that ψ leaf was the parameter that reflected the highest differences between treatments in this sense during the curve 1 significant differences were observed between c 100 and the remaining treatments at 11 30 and 14 30 h with an abrupt descend in the readings conducted at 17 30 2 0 mpa without differences between the three irrigation treatments during the curve 2 the ψ leaf values registered in c 100 were significant different than those registered in the remaining treatments during all day except at 8 30 h not being reached the threshold value of 1 5 mpa in c 100 finally it also draws attention that during curve 3 c 100 reached again ψ leaf values close to 2 0 mpa as it was fitted for the curve 1 it is remarkable that whereas ψ leaf was able to show significant differences between treatments this fact was not as patent in terms of g s because of the low capacity of almond to regulate the stomatal closure under drought conditions in this regard almond trees present a fast recovery of water potential but a delay in the values of g s as it has been stated by authors such as torrecillas et al 1996 or romero et al 2004 in this line in physiological terms when almond is subjected to a mild to moderate water stress situation a stomatal conductance reduction is not as patent as the effects in terms of water potential because of its low capability of regulating the stomata when a water stress situation is applied as it has been discussed by some authors such as wartinger et al 1990 egea et al 2011 or ecchi 2013 in this agreement previously to observe a significant reduction in g s almond responds with significant descends in terms of leaf or stem water potential garcía tejero et al 2012 2015b consequently almond would be able to maintain acceptable levels of g s promoting significant descends in the crop water potential but keeping optimum values of carbon assimilation photosynthetic rate and hence increasing the intrinsic water use efficiency mccutchan and shackel 1992 rouhi et al 2007 gomes laranjo et al 2006 reported values of ψ leaf for different cultivars which ranged between 1 72 and 2 0 mpa in glorieta 1 71 and 2 40 mpa in ferragnes 1 91 and 2 34 mpa in francoli 1 97 and 2 26 mpa in lauranne and 1 88 and 1 92 mpa in masbovera in this line these values correspond to measurements done at midday in well watered trees which are in line with the threshold range between 1 5 and 2 0 mpa considered and obtained in this work for c 100 obviously this water potential depletion affects to leaf gas exchange in this sense for full irrigated conditions daily cycle of gas exchange is almost constant when no radiation limitation occur torrecillas et al 1988 klein et al 2001 romero et al 2006 and vapour pressure deficit vpd is not higher than 2 k pa romero et al 2006 however in our case the values of vpd were higher than this value during the three curves when the readings were taken between 11 30 and 20 00 h which would explain the daily variation of g s in this study nevertheless torrecillas et al 1988 reported partial stomata closure in the daily cycle this being higher at midday than in the morning klein et al 2001 and reduce the sensibility to evaporative demand romero et al 2006 regarding to the recovery capability of the di treatments the most noticeable was the absence of differences between treatments at the beginning of the day 8 30 h these values being around 0 5 mpa that is although during the day the crop was subjected to water stress conditions this showed an optimum recovery capacity during the evening and night although this fact occurred faster in c 100 as was observed in the readings taking at 20 00 h this fact could be related to the experimental orchard location very close to the guadalquivir river course 100 m this would explain this certain capability of recovering being the trees able to take water during the night from deeper soil layers 3 2 relationships between thermal parameters and physiological variables with the aim of stablishing the most appropriate moment to take the thermal readings and the best thermal indicator in order to determine the plant water status different relationships were obtained between the thermal parameters and the related physiological variables these relationships being obtained for each monitoring time previously the non water stress baseline was defined which was calculated using the canopy temperature readings obtained from full irrigated trees and the values of air temperature and vapour pressure deficit in each monitoring time fig 5 we used the methodology proposed by idso et al 1981 and jackson et al 1981 to derive non water stressed baselines from the δtcanopy air values obtained from the c 100 trees n 15 and vpd values registered for each time and monitoring day table 2 it was noticeable that if these functions had been defined separately for each curve the slopes of them 1 84 1 88 and 1 85 for curves 1 3 respectively were very similar according to berni et al 2009 for the case of olive the slope values could be affected by errors in the estimation of tc and the measurement of tair although more interesting conclusion was the one derived from the comparison between the effect of net radiation and wind speed in the interception point suggesting that the slopes obtained for different non water stressed baselines estimated from a theorist proposed model by them were very similar to the obtained from empirical information and the highest variations were observed in the interception point similar results were reported by testi et al 2008 in pistachio trees evidencing that daily variations in net radiation resulted in parallel baselines not being affected the slope of baseline in our case the non water stress baselines obtained independently for each curve showed very similar slopes focusing the differences in the interception points 1 25 3 64 and 4 22 for curves 1 3 respectively once defined the non water stress baseline the values of cwsi and i g were estimated in order to normalize the t c readings and to define the most advisable thermal index to assess the almond water status using thermal information according to garcía tejero et al 2016b there are many variables such as the air temperature vapour pressure deficit the radiation level or its angle of incidence on the leaf surface that will influence decisively on the absolute value of tc and have to be considered these indexes normalize the absolute values of temperature obtaining a second value in which the effects of this set of potentially influential variables are partially minimized garcía tejero et al 2015a once the t c readings were normalized with the air temperature and cwsi i g calculated the different relationships with ψ leaf and g s were defined for each monitoring time considered in the three daily curves table 3 according to the results the most significant relationships were for the readings taken at 11 30 14 30 and 17 30 h although some differences were found depending on the thermal indicator and the physiological parameter considered thus it is remarkable that at 11 30 h the best relationships were fixed between the thermal information and ψ leaf whereas the relationships for g s were not significant therefore at 11 30 h t c as well as cwsi showed the most significant relationships when these relationships were obtained for the readings taken at 14 30 h t c and cwsi reported the most significant relationships again and in this case these were noteworthy as for g s as for ψ leaf evidencing that the measurements taken at 14 30 h would be more representative than those fixed at 11 30 h the robustness of these relationships decreased for the readings taken at 17 30 and 20 00 being not recommendable the readings during the evening and at the end of the day previous literature showed that infrared thermal imaging can be used to assess the crop water status under field conditions jones et al 2002 möller et al 2007 garcöa tejero et al 2016b however for a proper management of deficit irrigation strategies it is essential to identify the most appropriate and robust thermal index as well as the best time of the day to perform the infrared thermal readings in our case we hypothesized that the most appropriate moment would be in those hours of the day at which the most significant differences in terms of t c and the physiological traits ψ leaf and g s were detected that is the most significant differences between treatments were detected for the readings taken at 11 30 14 30 and 17 30 h and especially in terms of ψ leaf coinciding this period of the day with the moments under the highest air evaporative demand in this context many authors have demonstrated that the best time of the day to do more robust and physiologically meaningful temperature readings was at midday gonzalez dugo et al 2014 pou et al 2014 bellvert et al 2014 garcía tejero et al 2011 2016b our findings show that thermal information was highly correlated with ψ leaf and g s at 14 30 h table 3 and 11 30 h exclusively for the case of ψ leaf the different indicators studied have advantages and disadvantages that must be taken into account when they are used for water stress monitoring at field level regarding the simplicity and the time consuming aspects the absolute value of t c and the δt canopy air would be more recommendable because they are easy to calculate moreover these have been successfully used in water stress monitoring of relevant woody crops such as citrus garcía tejero et al 2011 almonds garcía tejero et al 2012 vines garcía tejero et al 2016a b or olives garcía tejero et al 2017 t c would not be the best water stress indicator because of the high variability of this parameter in relation to the weather conditions in this sense δt canopy air would be more representative especially if this is used taking the derived information from the non water stress baselines the simplicity of this indicator could favour its usage as a preliminary indicator of stress however it is necessary to consider that this parameter is more influenced by weather conditions than cwsi and hence it can have major limitations for remote sensing characterization for crop water status whereas the cwsi would be more robust especially under more variable environmental conditions along the day in this line fig 6 shows the relationships between t c δt canopy air and cwsi with ψ leaf by using the readings taken at 11 30 14 30 and 17 30 h according to this results showed the higher robustness of cwsi in comparison to the absolute values of t c being a good thermal indicator to monitor the crop water status and estimate the values of ψ leaf in almond when these readings are taken within the range of 11 30 and 17 30 h similar results were obtained by gonzalez dugo et al 2014 when they suggested the advantages of taking the thermal readings at midday in order to find the best results in terms of irrigation scheduling and crop water monitoring although in their case thermal readings were taken by means of uav this strategy being specially recommended to study the crop variability regarding the range of values obtained for cwsi it is remarkable that in spite of these values should be within the range of 0 1 in our case some values were below to 0 this fact could be promoted by two questions the necessity of stablishing references values of twet and tdry or maybe by the fact of improving the non water stress baselines functions by using different equations for different phenological stages different moments along the day similar situations have been reported by other authors such as egea et al 2017 or garcía tejero et al 2017 in olives when these authors used non water stress baselines calculated by using thermal data from well irrigated trees and taking as reference value of tdry tair 5 c these assumptions could promote little deviations of cwsi out of the range of 0 1 3 3 strategies to assess the canopy temperature readings at two different levels finally once determined the best moment along the day to assess the almond water status by means of infrared thermal readings and the most robust thermal indexes two different methodologies were assessed to take the images the first of them at tree level and the other at row level for this during the curves 1 and 2 together with the thermal readings taken at tree level images at row level were taken to monitor the canopy of consecutive trees subjected to the same irrigation strategy whereas the first strategy allows to monitor a representative area of one tree being processed in order to delete those pixels that does not correspond with the canopy the second strategy allows to monitor a higher number of trees but the further discrimination to analyse the images is less precise than the previous one tables 4 and 5 show examples of the images taken under these two procedures at different moments along the days and the average values of tc obtained at tree and row level these measurements were related with the aim of corroborate if the thermal information obtained at tree level and requiring an image processing was similar to those obtained using the images taken at row level with a processing of images faster than that required when these are taken at tree level as it can be observed the relationships were highly significant p 0 01 and very similar to the function y x evidencing that the obtained measurements at row level were very similar than those obtained for each monitored tree fig 7 these results demonstrate that the procedure of capturing images and their subsequent analysis could be done easier without committing the quality and robustness of the provided information although any crop has a set of inherent characteristics when we want to use the infrared thermal imaging for monitor the crop water status one of the most important characteristic to be taken into account will be the crop morphology in addition there are some limitations usually associated with the procedure of capturing and processing data requiring in many cases the use of complex software thus reducing the operational and affordability of such these techniques the aim of these methodologies is to exclude those parts of the tree that not are susceptible of being monitored branches trunk etc garcía tejero et al 2012 hand operated cameras allow taking images of individual plants or portions of them but during the capturing process different elements soil shady areas sky or portions of adjacent plants can be reflected requiring a subsequent time consuming processing images garcía tejero et al 2015a this difficulty is specially marked in woody crops with discontinuous canopies and a ground cover less than 100 jiménez bello et al 2011 some authors such as zarco tejada et al 2009 or garcía tejero et al 2012 have described different methods to overcome such limitations although all of them have previously required different images processing either through editing software and image processing either through processes of classification of pixels or through relatively laborious statistical analysis however attempting to the obtained results in the present work the thermal information provided by the images taken at row level was very similar to that reported after processing the images taken at tree level this fact supposes an important consideration in order to standardize the methodology of this technique when this is going to be used by field operators to assess the crop water status aiming to perform irrigation scheduling 4 conclusions considering the aims previously defined in the present work cwsi would be the most appropriate thermal index to monitor the almond water status in this sense the normalization achieved using the cwsi significantly improved the possibility of estimating the values of leaf water status especially when thermal readings are taken between 11 30 and 17 30 h these coinciding with daily period of maximum evapotranspirative demand on the other hand considering the different scales to take the thermal readings the results allow us concluding that the images taken at row level were enough robust to be used to estimate the water status being the canopy temperature values very similar to those obtained at tree level nevertheless some aspects should be considered in future works such as the estimation of different baselines for the different phenological stages in almond and the effect of the moment of the day in these types of functions therefore infrared thermal imaging supposes an alternative tool as a non invasive technique in modern agriculture addressing in improvement in the water resources management irrigation scheduling and the crop water monitoring according to the findings of the present work the infrared approach has a great advantage due to the robustness of the provided information the versatility of the measurements that are taken and the feasibility in developing experiments at different scales thus infrared thermography is a suitable technique to monitor the almond water status especially when this is subjected to

11369,almond prunnus dulcis mill has been traditionally associated to marginal land cultivation and rain fed agriculture in south spain however in the last years this crop is being progressively introduced in more productive agricultural areas within the guadalquivir river basin where the available water resources are not enough to satisfy the adequate crop water requirements considering this limitation a more precise irrigation scheduling to maximize the yield is required infrared thermal imaging emerges as alternative to other traditional methodologies to assess the crop water status especially when deficit irrigation di strategies are being applied the aim of this study was to define the methodology to assess the almond water status by means of thermal information the trial was conducted during 2014 during the kernel filling period in an almond experimental orchard sw spain with 5 year old trees subjected to three irrigation regimes i a full irrigation treatment c 100 which received 100 of etc ii a regulated deficit irrigation rdi 50 which received 100 of etc except during the kernel filling period when this treatment was irrigated with 50 of etc iii and a low frequency deficit irrigation treatment lfdi which received 100 of etc except during the kernel filling period when it was subjected to continuous periods of irrigation restriction defined in terms of the threshold values of shaded leaf water potential ψ leaf three daily curves of canopy temperature t c stomatal conductance to water vapour g s and ψ leaf with measurements at 8 00 11 00 14 00 17 00 and 20 00 were developed additionally crop water stress index cwsi temperature difference between canopy and the surrounding air δt canopy air and the relative index to stomatal conductance i g obtained at different scales canopy and row were estimated significant correlations of infrared thermal information vs ψ leaf and g s were obtained p 0 05 and p 0 01 in particular by using the thermal readings taken at 11 30 14 30 at 17 30 h especially robust were the relationships obtained between t c and cwsi with ψ leaf at 11 30 h and between t c and cwsi with g s and ψ leaf at 14 30 h finally considering the infrared thermal monitoring procedure readings at tree and row level similar values of t c were obtained and therefore the images taken at row level offered a better information with a higher feasibility in terms of image processing keywords thermography thermal indexes water stress leaf gas exchange and leaf water potential 1 introduction irrigated agriculture in the south of europe and more concretely in semi arid areas such as andalusia s spain is crucial for their development especially in those rural regions with a lower economic potential in this line for the case of andalusia irrigated agriculture generates more than 60 of rural employments and represents 64 of agricultural production currently 1 176 000 ha are devoted to irrigated agriculture corresponding to 24 of total andalusian agricultural surface and this being 33 of the irrigated agriculture in spain ara 2011 climatic conditions in this area are characterized by the scarcity and irregularity of rainfall coinciding the dry period with the season of highest evapotranspiration moreover the last forecast predictions argue significant water resources depletions with an important declining in the soil water reserves more accused periods of rainfall restrictions and increasing in the average temperatures ipcc 2014 in this agreement it is expected that this situation promotes an imbalance between the irrigation demand and the available water resources in the mediterranean agriculture daccache et al 2012 olesen et al 2011 this fact will suppose an important constraint for the competitiveness between agriculture and other more productive sectors such as the industry or tourism in addition the introduction of alternative crops in order to maximize the profitability of agroecosystems will be required together with different strategies to improve the agricultural water management garcía tejero et al 2014a in this context almond prunus dulcis mill is the third crop in terms of surface in spain representing globally almost 40 and 84 within the eu however only 5 of the global production is developed in spain faostat 2016 concretely the surface of almond in andalusia is about 152 000 ha and within them 95 are associated to marginal and rain fed agriculture because of the climate limitations where annual rainfalls does not exceed of 300 mm with low nut yields capdr 2016 however in the last few years the agricultural surface devoted to almond crop has significant increased specially in areas where this crop was not traditionally cultivated these new orchards being cultivated under intensive and irrigation practices thus almond can be found under very different agricultural systems from the most marginal situations to the most intensive orchards which promotes a wide range of yields from 150 to 2600 kg ha 1 capdr 2016 according to goldhamer and fereres 2016 irrigation is the most limiting factor for this crop with crop water requirements oscillating between 900 and 1350 mm goldhamer and girona 2012 in this agreement goldhamer and fereres 2016 reported values close to 4000 kg ha 1 depending on the cultivar for irrigation doses around 1250 mm with yield reductions close to 14 when the irrigation doses were close to 1000 mm more recently lópez lópez et al 2018 in a long term experience developed in the province of córdoba andalusia south spain reported maximum yield values 2500 kg ha 1 in mature almond trees cv guara when these trees were irrigated receiving the maximum crop water requirements close to 10 000 m3 ha 1 in spite of this almond is considered a drought resistant crop because of its xeromorphic properties torrecillas et al 1996 and many authors have reported different results related to the effects of deficit irrigation di strategies puerto et al 2013 phogat et al 2017 spinelli et al 2016 among others more recently lópez lópez et al 2018 discussed the effects of water deficits in almond trees in terms of water use evaluating different deficit irrigation di strategies during three consecutive years these authors found that almond trees under different moderate di strategies were able of keeping canopy volumes similar to those trees that were fully irrigated these being directly related with the almond capability to obtain yield values under moderate deficit irrigation similar to those reported by fully irrigated trees this fact being accompanied with similar soil water depletions and transpiration level taking into account the maximum crop water demand the water scarcity in semi arid areas and the proper response of this crop to moderate water stress di would be a suitable alternative to reach equilibrium between the available water resources and a proper crop development with final yields able to ensure the competitiveness and feasibility of this crop garcía tejero et al 2016a however the application of di strategies requires a proper knowledge about the crop physiological status with the aim of ensuring the correct crop development without significant compromising the yield and fruit quality especially when water stress is applied in different crop stages spinelli et al 2016 in this sense according to puerto et al 2013 when a di strategy is applied in fruit trees this is mainly developed supplying a specific water withholding taken as reference the crop water requirements by means of the crop evapotranspiration etc without taking into account the effects of canopy architecture the degree of canopy cover or the soil management among others or without considering the crop physiological status when this water stress is applied in this regard the most proper irrigation scheduling should consider the whole of soil plant atmosphere system although in terms or representativeness the live component plant would be offering the most valuable information inasmuch as this reflects the most integrative information mainly in terms of final yield traditionally crop water monitoring has been developed by using punctual measurements of stem ψ stem or leaf ψ leaf water potential at midday or pre dawn ψ pd shackel 2011 nortes et al 2005 or monitoring the gas exchange parameters such as transpiration e stomatal conductance g s or net photosynthetic rate a gomes laranjo et al 2006 according to remorini and massai 2003 ψstem is not only a proper indicator of plant water status as well as the crop productivity in the same vein mirás avalos et al 2016 reported that water potential is a suitable indicator of almond water status although its usefulness is reduced because of a minimum number of replications are required and the representativeness in the whole plant is reduced in the last years the use of remote sensing in agriculture and more concretely infrared thermal imaging to monitor the crop water status has been progressively introduced costa et al 2013 this technique has been properly described as a good methodology for crop water monitoring in different woody crops such as citrus garcía tejero et al 2011 gonzalez dugo et al 2014 young almonds garcía tejero et al 2012 vines garcía tejero et al 2016b or olives egea et al 2017 this technique is based on the leaf energy balance when a water stress situation is applied plants responds with a partial stomatal closure reducing the stomatal conductance limiting the leaf transpiration and promoting an attenuation of the evaporative cooling process resulting in higher leaf canopy temperature values jones 1999 2004 this technique can be applied at different monitoring scales from leaf or canopy to orchard or basin level poblete echeverría et al 2014 2016 the selection of the most proper methodology will be related with the desired goal and the economic availability costa et al 2013 in this sense the use of thermography at orchard scale by using satellites images allows to take decisions related to crop variability or irrigation scheduling but some constraints must be taken into account on one hand thermal images taking by satellites have the difficulty of depending of the moment in which the satellite passes above the orchard and on the other hand the spatial and spectral resolution is not proper these constraints could be solved by using of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs despite its economically restrictions in this sense the use of thermal images at orchard scale taken by means of uavs requires having the proper technology and this fact can increase the cost of this tool becoming less accessible the use of this technology by the contrast these sensors can be used at plant level with thermal cameras much more profitable easing the accessibility to this technique by the irrigation communities or technicians likewise the main constraints of this technique are focused in the image processing many times requiring high time consuming and the correct interpretation of the infrared thermal information garcía tejero et al 2015a because of this many times different relationships between infrared thermal information and other physiological parameters such as g s a e or ψ stem are required jones 2004 jones et al 2009 although these relationships are not always enough robust because of the high dependence of the meteorological conditions jones 1999 2004 the monitoring proceedings costa et al 2013 the cultivar costa et al 2012 garcía tejero et al 2016b or even the crop phenological stage cohen et al 2015 up to day several authors have developed strategies to optimize this technique developing different protocols and strategies to take thermal readings under field conditions jones et al 2009 pou et al 2014 poblete echeverría et al 2014 2016 garcía tejero et al 2012 2016b and describing different relationships between infrared thermal information and physiological parameters we hypothesize that thermography could be a suitable technique to monitor almond water status especially when this is subjected to di programs the aim of the present work was to evaluate the performance of thermography under field conditions at two monitoring levels plant and row to assess the crop water status in almond trees cv guara determining the best moment of the day to obtain the thermal information and the most robust thermal index to interpret properly the crop water status 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site the trial was

irrigation treatments were applied i a full irrigated treatment c 100 which received 100 of the crop evapotranspiration et c during the irrigation period 60 304 day of the year doy ii a regulated deficit irrigation rdi 50 which received 100 of etc except during the kernel filling period and pre harvest when this treatment was irrigated at 50 of etc according to this the kernel filling period took place from 171 to 227 doy and pre harvest from 228 to 243 doy this period coinciding with the time in which the kernel has finished its growth and the nut split period begins just before the irrigation withholding 250 doy seven days before the harvesting 257 doy iii and a low frequency deficit irrigation lfdi which received the 100 et c during the irrigation period except during the kernel filling stage and pre harvest when this treatment was irrigated according the registered values of ψ leaf measured in shaded leaves in this sense during the kernel filling period from 171 to 227 doy this treatment was subjected to irrigation restriction cycles with the following irrigation dynamic once started the kernel filling period irrigation was supressed till reaching values of ψ leaf close to 2 0 mpa then trees were re watered with the same periodicity and amount of water as c 100 approximately during 5 7 days till reaching similar values of ψ leaf to those registered in c 100 once this threshold value was reached this treatment was subjected to a new restriction period until the threshold of ψ leaf 2 0 mpa was again surpassed this dynamic of irrigation restriction cycles was maintained during whole stage of kernel filling period until harvesting irrigation doses were calculated according to the methodology proposed by allen et al 1998 obtaining the values of reference evapotranspiration according to the penman monteith equation by using a weather station installed in the same experimental orchard and using the crop coefficients obtained by garcía tejero et al 2015b which ranged between 0 6 and 1 2 according to this irrigation doses applied to c 100 rdi 50 and lfdi were 6 850 4 400 and 4 180 m3 ha 1 respectively table 1 2 3 plant measurements during the experimental period three daily curves of canopy temperature tc stomatal conductance to water vapour gs and leaf water potential ψleaf were obtained during the kernel filling and pre harvest period these readings were taken at 08 30 11 30 14 30 17 30 and 20 00 h local time during the days 29th july curve 1 210 doy 5th august curve 2 217 doy and 27th august curve 3 239 doy these days coincided with the irrigation restriction periods of lfdi with the aim of registering the crop physiological status during periods of maximum water stress in this treatment in this sense curve 2 was developed a week after curve 1 the reason was that when curve 1 was developed lfdi has been subjected to seven days of irrigation restriction taking into account the obtained results during this curve it was decided to extend this period once more week in order to register the crop physiological response under a situation of maximum stress finally between curve 2 and 3 there was a recovery period from 218 to 225 doy being the curve 3 developed after 14 days without irrigation in similar conditions at curve 2 table 2 shows the values of air temperature tair relative humidity rh and vapour pressure deficit vpd registered during the sampling days and for each monitoring hour measurements of ψ leaf were conducted by using a pressure chamber soil moisture equipment corp sta barbara ca usa monitoring 12 trees per irrigation treatment one leaf per tree located in the north side of the tree and being totally mature fresh and shaded at 1 5 m of height approximately additionally the stomatal conductance to water vapor g s was measured in these same trees by using a porometer sc 1 decagon devices inc wa usa on one leaf completely exposed to the sun per monitored tree and at 1 5 m of height tc was measured by using a thermacam flir sc660 flir systems usa 7 13 μm 640 480 pixels throughout the day 8 30 h 11 30 h 14 30 h 17 30 h and 20 00 h local time with emissivity ε set at 0 96 each pixel corresponds to an effective temperature reading jones 2004 two methodologies were tested to monitor the canopy temperature i 12 images were taken at tree level one image per tree assessed thee being the same trees in which the measurements of ψ leaf and g s were developed for each daily curve treatment and moment of the day and ii during curves 1 and 2 thermal images were taken at row level so that the trees monitored in the same image were subjected to the same irrigation treatment fig 1 these images at tree level were taken in the sunlit side of the trees with the imager placed at 2 m of the canopy fig 1 background temperature was determined by measuring the temperature of a crumpled sheet of aluminium foil placed close to the leaves of interest using ε 1 jones et al 2002 to facilitate the further analysis of these images a cooled white screen was used as background this being placed behind of each monitored tree to simplify the isolation of the canopy surface through image processing thermal images at tree level were analysed with the software developed by garcía tejero et al 2012 this software allows to remove those areas or pixels considered stem and the background fig 2 for the case of the images taken at row level these were analysed using the software thermacam research pro flir systems usa selecting a specific area on the left and on the right and obtaining the average value of tc for each area fig 3 this methodology is much faster than the previous described by garcía tejero et al 2012 although it does not discriminates the representative areas with the same feasibility and the areas selection is done according to the visual perspective of the operator considering the tc values obtained at tree level three different thermal indicators were calculated the difference between canopy and the surrounding air δt canopy air the crop water stress index cwsi and the index of the relative stomatal conductance these being calculated as follows costa et al 2013 1 δtcanopy air tc tair 2 c w s i δ t c a n o p y a i r δ t w e t δ t d r y δ t w e t 3 i g δ t d r y δ t c a n o p y a i r δ t c a n o p y a i r δ t w e t where δt canopy air δt dry and δt wet are the differences between canopy and air temperature for the crop in the moment of the measurement when the crop has the stomata fully closed and when it is fully transpiring respectively tc is the canopy temperature and tair the temperature of the surrounding air to obtain the reference values of δtwet there was estimated the non water stress baseline δtcanopy air a b vpd according to idso et al 1981 using a δt dry value equal to 5 c as it was proposed by jackson et al 1981 non water stress baseline was estimated using the canopy temperature readings obtained from full irrigated trees c 100 2 4 experimental design and statistical analysis the experimental design was of randomized blocks with four replications per irrigation treatment each replication had 15 trees 3 rows and 5 trees per row being monitored the three central rows for each replication n 12 for each measurement day an exploratory descriptive analysis of data ψ leaf g s and t c was conducted by applying a levene s test to check the variance homogeneity of the studied variables significant differences between irrigation treatments p 0 05 in the studied variables were identified by applying a one way anova and a tukey s test for treatment separation with the spss statistical software spss inc 15 0 statistical package chicago il usa to evaluate the non water stress baselines a linear correlation analysis was made n 15 to evaluate the relationships between variables a linear correlation analysis between the values of thermal indicators t c δt canopy air cwsi and i g and the crop physiological variables ψ leaf and g s was made by using the average values for each treatment and sampling time n 9 the obtained correlation coefficients were used to identify which would be the best time to carry out t c readings and the most representative thermal index as a proxy for crop physiology traits finally comparative study between the t c readings taken at tree and row level was conducted by means of a linear correlation analysis between these values using the average values for each treatment and the whole data obtained during the two first daily curves n 30 3 results and discussion 3 1 daily evolution of crop physiological status fig 4 shows the evolution of ψ leaf g s and t c measured at tree level during the three daily curves developed during the irrigation period in which the water stress regimes were imposed on overall as the climatic conditions along the day became more adverse ψ leaf reached more negative values with a final recovery at the end of the day by contrast g s increased during the first readings until reaching a maximum point in which a significant decrease was observed this coinciding with the moment of the day in which the climatic conditions were more extreme after this point a slight recovery of g s was found with the last measurements of the day in relation to tc this variable showed a more dependent trend on the climatic conditions along the day reaching the maximum values in those moments in which the t air values were the highest during curves 1 and 2 the lowest values of ψ leaf were reached at 17 30 h coinciding with the highest vpd values registered during these days and with the moments in which the t c values were maximum considering the obtained values for each treatment no differences were observed at 8 30 h but these were appearing along the day without observing a total recovery between the di treatments and c 100 at 20 00 h it is remarkable that the observed differences in terms of ψ leaf were higher during the curve 2 this being associated with the more severe climatic conditions detected and the imposed water restriction period for lfdi in this curve which had been prolonged for a further seven days in comparison to curve 1 regarding to g s during curve 1 all the treatments showed a growing tendency reaching the maximum values at 14 30 h vpd 2 61 kpa however during the curve 2 the maximum values were observed at 11 30 h vpd 1 82 from which g s decreased showing a partial recovering in c 100 at the end of the day this difference observed for the case of g s could be associated with the more severe climatic conditions registered during the curve 2 in comparison to the previous one finally it is noticeable that the depletion in t c was accompanied with a slight recovery of gs and the slight recovery of ψ leaf and g s during the readings at 20 00 h regarding to the values obtained during the curve 3 it was obtained three weeks after curve 2 when climate conditions were similar to those observed in the previous one and lfdi was subjected to 15 days of irrigation restriction in this sense it was observed a similar trend to that detected in curve 2 with the highest values of g s observed at 11 30 vpd 1 31 kpa with a significant reduction in all the treatments at 14 30 h followed by a partial recovery at 17 30 h and a new descend at the end of the day this decreasing trend occurred at 14 30 h being this response associated with a partial stomatal closure when climatic conditions specially the vpd values are strongly elevated even more this descend in the values of g s promoted that the readings of ψ leaf between 11 30 and 14 30 were similar and the partial recovery of g s at 17 30 was accompanied with a significant lessen values of ψ leaf relating to the t c readings these were highly determined by the climatic conditions on overall t c readings in the three studied treatments were below to air temperature t air except the readings taken at 08 30 and 11 30 h for the curves 2 and 3 the highest differences in t c between treatments were detected specially in the readings taken at 11 30 14 30 and 17 00 although these were not as patent as for the case of ψ leaf on overall and taking into account the monitored physiological variables it can be assumed that ψ leaf was the parameter that reflected the highest differences between treatments in this sense during the curve 1 significant differences were observed between c 100 and the remaining treatments at 11 30 and 14 30 h with an abrupt descend in the readings conducted at 17 30 2 0 mpa without differences between the three irrigation treatments during the curve 2 the ψ leaf values registered in c 100 were significant different than those registered in the remaining treatments during all day except at 8 30 h not being reached the threshold value of 1 5 mpa in c 100 finally it also draws attention that during curve 3 c 100 reached again ψ leaf values close to 2 0 mpa as it was fitted for the curve 1 it is remarkable that whereas ψ leaf was able to show significant differences between treatments this fact was not as patent in terms of g s because of the low capacity of almond to regulate the stomatal closure under drought conditions in this regard almond trees present a fast recovery of water potential but a delay in the values of g s as it has been stated by authors such as torrecillas et al 1996 or romero et al 2004 in this line in physiological terms when almond is subjected to a mild to moderate water stress situation a stomatal conductance reduction is not as patent as the effects in terms of water potential because of its low capability of regulating the stomata when a water stress situation is applied as it has been discussed by some authors such as wartinger et al 1990 egea et al 2011 or ecchi 2013 in this agreement previously to observe a significant reduction in g s almond responds with significant descends in terms of leaf or stem water potential garcía tejero et al 2012 2015b consequently almond would be able to maintain acceptable levels of g s promoting significant descends in the crop water potential but keeping optimum values of carbon assimilation photosynthetic rate and hence increasing the intrinsic water use efficiency mccutchan and shackel 1992 rouhi et al 2007 gomes laranjo et al 2006 reported values of ψ leaf for different cultivars which ranged between 1 72 and 2 0 mpa in glorieta 1 71 and 2 40 mpa in ferragnes 1 91 and 2 34 mpa in francoli 1 97 and 2 26 mpa in lauranne and 1 88 and 1 92 mpa in masbovera in this line these values correspond to measurements done at midday in well watered trees which are in line with the threshold range between 1 5 and 2 0 mpa considered and obtained in this work for c 100 obviously this water potential depletion affects to leaf gas exchange in this sense for full irrigated conditions daily cycle of gas exchange is almost constant when no radiation limitation occur torrecillas et al 1988 klein et al 2001 romero et al 2006 and vapour pressure deficit vpd is not higher than 2 k pa romero et al 2006 however in our case the values of vpd were higher than this value during the three curves when the readings were taken between 11 30 and 20 00 h which would explain the daily variation of g s in this study nevertheless torrecillas et al 1988 reported partial stomata closure in the daily cycle this being higher at midday than in the morning klein et al 2001 and reduce the sensibility to evaporative demand romero et al 2006 regarding to the recovery capability of the di treatments the most noticeable was the absence of differences between treatments at the beginning of the day 8 30 h these values being around 0 5 mpa that is although during the day the crop was subjected to water stress conditions this showed an optimum recovery capacity during the evening and night although this fact occurred faster in c 100 as was observed in the readings taking at 20 00 h this fact could be related to the experimental orchard location very close to the guadalquivir river course 100 m this would explain this certain capability of recovering being the trees able to take water during the night from deeper soil layers 3 2 relationships between thermal parameters and physiological variables with the aim of stablishing the most appropriate moment to take the thermal readings and the best thermal indicator in order to determine the plant water status different relationships were obtained between the thermal parameters and the related physiological variables these relationships being obtained for each monitoring time previously the non water stress baseline was defined which was calculated using the canopy temperature readings obtained from full irrigated trees and the values of air temperature and vapour pressure deficit in each monitoring time fig 5 we used the methodology proposed by idso et al 1981 and jackson et al 1981 to derive non water stressed baselines from the δtcanopy air values obtained from the c 100 trees n 15 and vpd values registered for each time and monitoring day table 2 it was noticeable that if these functions had been defined separately for each curve the slopes of them 1 84 1 88 and 1 85 for curves 1 3 respectively were very similar according to berni et al 2009 for the case of olive the slope values could be affected by errors in the estimation of tc and the measurement of tair although more interesting conclusion was the one derived from the comparison between the effect of net radiation and wind speed in the interception point suggesting that the slopes obtained for different non water stressed baselines estimated from a theorist proposed model by them were very similar to the obtained from empirical information and the highest variations were observed in the interception point similar results were reported by testi et al 2008 in pistachio trees evidencing that daily variations in net radiation resulted in parallel baselines not being affected the slope of baseline in our case the non water stress baselines obtained independently for each curve showed very similar slopes focusing the differences in the interception points 1 25 3 64 and 4 22 for curves 1 3 respectively once defined the non water stress baseline the values of cwsi and i g were estimated in order to normalize the t c readings and to define the most advisable thermal index to assess the almond water status using thermal information according to garcía tejero et al 2016b there are many variables such as the air temperature vapour pressure deficit the radiation level or its angle of incidence on the leaf surface that will influence decisively on the absolute value of tc and have to be considered these indexes normalize the absolute values of temperature obtaining a second value in which the effects of this set of potentially influential variables are partially minimized garcía tejero et al 2015a once the t c readings were normalized with the air temperature and cwsi i g calculated the different relationships with ψ leaf and g s were defined for each monitoring time considered in the three daily curves table 3 according to the results the most significant relationships were for the readings taken at 11 30 14 30 and 17 30 h although some differences were found depending on the thermal indicator and the physiological parameter considered thus it is remarkable that at 11 30 h the best relationships were fixed between the thermal information and ψ leaf whereas the relationships for g s were not significant therefore at 11 30 h t c as well as cwsi showed the most significant relationships when these relationships were obtained for the readings taken at 14 30 h t c and cwsi reported the most significant relationships again and in this case these were noteworthy as for g s as for ψ leaf evidencing that the measurements taken at 14 30 h would be more representative than those fixed at 11 30 h the robustness of these relationships decreased for the readings taken at 17 30 and 20 00 being not recommendable the readings during the evening and at the end of the day previous literature showed that infrared thermal imaging can be used to assess the crop water status under field conditions jones et al 2002 möller et al 2007 garcöa tejero et al 2016b however for a proper management of deficit irrigation strategies it is essential to identify the most appropriate and robust thermal index as well as the best time of the day to perform the infrared thermal readings in our case we hypothesized that the most appropriate moment would be in those hours of the day at which the most significant differences in terms of t c and the physiological traits ψ leaf and g s were detected that is the most significant differences between treatments were detected for the readings taken at 11 30 14 30 and 17 30 h and especially in terms of ψ leaf coinciding this period of the day with the moments under the highest air evaporative demand in this context many authors have demonstrated that the best time of the day to do more robust and physiologically meaningful temperature readings was at midday gonzalez dugo et al 2014 pou et al 2014 bellvert et al 2014 garcía tejero et al 2011 2016b our findings show that thermal information was highly correlated with ψ leaf and g s at 14 30 h table 3 and 11 30 h exclusively for the case of ψ leaf the different indicators studied have advantages and disadvantages that must be taken into account when they are used for water stress monitoring at field level regarding the simplicity and the time consuming aspects the absolute value of t c and the δt canopy air would be more recommendable because they are easy to calculate moreover these have been successfully used in water stress monitoring of relevant woody crops such as citrus garcía tejero et al 2011 almonds garcía tejero et al 2012 vines garcía tejero et al 2016a b or olives garcía tejero et al 2017 t c would not be the best water stress indicator because of the high variability of this parameter in relation to the weather conditions in this sense δt canopy air would be more representative especially if this is used taking the derived information from the non water stress baselines the simplicity of this indicator could favour its usage as a preliminary indicator of stress however it is necessary to consider that this parameter is more influenced by weather conditions than cwsi and hence it can have major limitations for remote sensing characterization for crop water status whereas the cwsi would be more robust especially under more variable environmental conditions along the day in this line fig 6 shows the relationships between t c δt canopy air and cwsi with ψ leaf by using the readings taken at 11 30 14 30 and 17 30 h according to this results showed the higher robustness of cwsi in comparison to the absolute values of t c being a good thermal indicator to monitor the crop water status and estimate the values of ψ leaf in almond when these readings are taken within the range of 11 30 and 17 30 h similar results were obtained by gonzalez dugo et al 2014 when they suggested the advantages of taking the thermal readings at midday in order to find the best results in terms of irrigation scheduling and crop water monitoring although in their case thermal readings were taken by means of uav this strategy being specially recommended to study the crop variability regarding the range of values obtained for cwsi it is remarkable that in spite of these values should be within the range of 0 1 in our case some values were below to 0 this fact could be promoted by two questions the necessity of stablishing references values of twet and tdry or maybe by the fact of improving the non water stress baselines functions by using different equations for different phenological stages different moments along the day similar situations have been reported by other authors such as egea et al 2017 or garcía tejero et al 2017 in olives when these authors used non water stress baselines calculated by using thermal data from well irrigated trees and taking as reference value of tdry tair 5 c these assumptions could promote little deviations of cwsi out of the range of 0 1 3 3 strategies to assess the canopy temperature readings at two different levels finally once determined the best moment along the day to assess the almond water status by means of infrared thermal readings and the most robust thermal indexes two different methodologies were assessed to take the images the first of them at tree level and the other at row level for this during the curves 1 and 2 together with the thermal readings taken at tree level images at row level were taken to monitor the canopy of consecutive trees subjected to the same irrigation strategy whereas the first strategy allows to monitor a representative area of one tree being processed in order to delete those pixels that does not correspond with the canopy the second strategy allows to monitor a higher number of trees but the further discrimination to analyse the images is less precise than the previous one tables 4 and 5 show examples of the images taken under these two procedures at different moments along the days and the average values of tc obtained at tree and row level these measurements were related with the aim of corroborate if the thermal information obtained at tree level and requiring an image processing was similar to those obtained using the images taken at row level with a processing of images faster than that required when these are taken at tree level as it can be observed the relationships were highly significant p 0 01 and very similar to the function y x evidencing that the obtained measurements at row level were very similar than those obtained for each monitored tree fig 7 these results demonstrate that the procedure of capturing images and their subsequent analysis could be done easier without committing the quality and robustness of the provided information although any crop has a set of inherent characteristics when we want to use the infrared thermal imaging for monitor the crop water status one of the most important characteristic to be taken into account will be the crop morphology in addition there are some limitations usually associated with the procedure of capturing and processing data requiring in many cases the use of complex software thus reducing the operational and affordability of such these techniques the aim of these methodologies is to exclude those parts of the tree that not are susceptible of being monitored branches trunk etc garcía tejero et al 2012 hand operated cameras allow taking images of individual plants or portions of them but during the capturing process different elements soil shady areas sky or portions of adjacent plants can be reflected requiring a subsequent time consuming processing images garcía tejero et al 2015a this difficulty is specially marked in woody crops with discontinuous canopies and a ground cover less than 100 jiménez bello et al 2011 some authors such as zarco tejada et al 2009 or garcía tejero et al 2012 have described different methods to overcome such limitations although all of them have previously required different images processing either through editing software and image processing either through processes of classification of pixels or through relatively laborious statistical analysis however attempting to the obtained results in the present work the thermal information provided by the images taken at row level was very similar to that reported after processing the images taken at tree level this fact supposes an important consideration in order to standardize the methodology of this technique when this is going to be used by field operators to assess the crop water status aiming to perform irrigation scheduling 4 conclusions considering the aims previously defined in the present work cwsi would be the most appropriate thermal index to monitor the almond water status in this sense the normalization achieved using the cwsi significantly improved the possibility of estimating the values of leaf water status especially when thermal readings are taken between 11 30 and 17 30 h these coinciding with daily period of maximum evapotranspirative demand on the other hand considering the different scales to take the thermal readings the results allow us concluding that the images taken at row level were enough robust to be used to estimate the water status being the canopy temperature values very similar to those obtained at tree level nevertheless some aspects should be considered in future works such as the estimation of different baselines for the different phenological stages in almond and the effect of the moment of the day in these types of functions therefore infrared thermal imaging supposes an alternative tool as a non invasive technique in modern agriculture addressing in improvement in the water resources management irrigation scheduling and the crop water monitoring according to the findings of the present work the infrared approach has a great advantage due to the robustness of the provided information the versatility of the measurements that are taken and the feasibility in developing experiments at different scales thus infrared thermography is a suitable technique to monitor the almond water status especially when this is subjected to deficit irrigation strategies acknowledgements part of this work was sponsored by the research project integrated management of almond and other nuts crops ava ava201601 18 within the operational
