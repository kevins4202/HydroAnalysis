provide safe water however hssfs require time for the growth of the biological layer schmutzdecke to achieve maximum performance especially when groundwater is used as it normally has few nutrients in this ripening period pathogenic microorganisms can pass through the filter in this context this study reports the performance of two hssf settings intermittent i hssf and continuous c hssf flows followed by disinfection with sodium hypochlorite to treat groundwater with escherichia coli giardia muris cysts and cryptosporidium parvum oocysts the weekly introduction of river water was tested as a filter ripening agent and this procedure reduced the ripening time in approximately 80 days filtered water disinfection improved the water quality and inactivated protozoa the costs and operational challenges addressed in this study can provide support to hssf technology transfer in rural communities worldwide graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords social technology pathogens schmutzdecke disinfection drinking water slow sand filtration 1 introduction almost a fifth of the world s population does not have access to water supply services mainly in rural areas and suburban regions pinderhughes 2004 untreated groundwater catchment for consumption is common in these areas precarious conditions of use and conservation of wells can contaminate drinking water causing health problems to the supplied community water treatments in a household level are essential to ensure human rights to safe water established by the united nations un unga 2015 consumption of contaminated water usually leads to diarrhoea that can cause approximately 485 000 deaths per year in low to medium income countries who 2019 diarrhoea and pneumonia are the two main causes of infant mortality who 2013 the presence of pathogens i e protozoa bacteria and viruses in drinking water is a health risk especially regarding the adverse events caused by climate changes which represent a threat from outbreaks of infectious diseases transmitted by water efstratiou et al 2017 protozoa more specifically giardia spp and cryptosporidium spp are responsible for gastrointestinal diseases with outbreaks recorded in several locations worldwide efstratiou et al 2017 observed 82 of the documented outbreaks between 2011 and 2016 reporting water supply system problems as the transmission route according to jadhav et al 2015 a household water treatment system can reduce the risk of waterborne disease transmission as well as best practices such as water source protection and safe storage household water treatment should be accessible to anyone easy to operate and maintain as well as culturally accepted das et al 2015 reported the difficulty of breaking habits and convincing communities to accept interventions for groundwater treatment when untreated water appears visually clear among the efforts for developing technologies adapted to local contexts is the so called point of use pou sobsey et al 2008 or household water treatment and safe storage hwts eawag and sandec 2008 in the 1990s david manz adapted the conventional slow sand filter for household level and intermittent flow which resulted in the household slow sand filter hssf this technology has been spread by several organizations and over 300 000 hssfs have been installed in more than 69 countries cawst 2012 hssf consists of combining physical and biological processes according to jadhav et al 2015 physical mechanisms include the retention of larger particles in the pores of the filter medium and adsorption which enable organic removal whereas the biological mechanisms include predation elimination natural death inactivation and partial reduction of organic carbon due to the microorganism metabolism therefore hssf treats water by combining physical processes with biological activity present on the sand filter surface schmutzdecke nevertheless achieving optimum technology performance requires a ripening period for the biological layer growth especially when groundwater is used in general groundwater has few nutrients when compared to surface water maciel and sabogal paz 2020 during the ripening time the treatment efficiency is reduced thus increasing the risk of pathogens passing through the pores of the filter media speeding up of the ripening period in hssf to treat groundwater is essential for safe water supply however ripening poses as a challenge especially considering simple solutions adapted to isolated communities in developing countries calixto et al 2020 according to bradley et al 2011 hssf can significantly increase the ripening time i e up to 200 days when groundwater is treated it should be noted that the hssf performance changes due to filter cleaning as biological layer growth is required thus filtered water must be disinfected for both the ripening period and complete maturing studies have aimed at optimizing hssf performance introducing biomass in the filter layer baig et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 calixto et al 2020 or iron oxide tellen et al 2010 bradley et al 2011 ahammed and davra 2011 comparisons are also made between different flows e g continuous and intermittent young rojanschi and madramootoo 2014 maciel and sabogal paz 2020 sabogal paz et al 2020 and the structure of the filter body in different materials such as concrete and plastic stauber et al 2012 arnold 2015 it is important to highlight that stored filtered water can be contaminated due to hygiene habits and the type of storage used by the user as observed by duke et al 2006 therefore disinfection of drinking water is required specifically in household disinfection with chlorine up to 6 log of bacteria or viruses and up to 5 log of some protozoa can be removed as long as the water turbidity remains below 1 0 ut who 2017 who 2019 highlights the importance of specific chlorine dosage in water for each location based on the chlorine demand in the water to be treated and also monitoring to ensure the maintenance of free chlorine concentrations between 0 2 and 0 5 mg l 1 chlorination with sodium hypochlorite is commonly used for water disinfection however this technology generates by products and is not always accepted by isolated communities due to changes in both taste and odour of water schmidt and cairncross 2009 this is often aggravated when chlorine is incorrectly applied i e excessive dosage by the population boiling water is a common technique in rural communities to obtain safe water clasen et al 2008 however the volume of treated water is limited 5 0 l day 1 and energy consumption gas electricity and wood can be considerable and even economically unfeasible in this context hssf followed by chlorination may be more practical than boiling filtered water moreover chlorinated water remains safe for a longer time considering this background this study evaluated the performance of two models of hssfs in full scale and in duplicate two filters in continuous flow and two filters in intermittent flow for the treatment of groundwater containing high concentrations of e coli g muris cysts and c parvum oocysts situation that can happen for example by leaking septic tanks two operation phases were evaluated with and without ripening agents river water to speed up the hssf ripening ripening consisted of a controlled introduction of river water to the filters for providing nutrients and improved conditions for developing the biological layer in a short time the ripening agent was selected because it can be easily accessible in rural areas thus river water emerged as a possible solution for an exploratory study when groundwater is used for supply and hssf as a treatment rapid biological layer ripening of the filter is essential in order to reduce the microbiological risk of the effluent in our study filtered water was disinfected with sodium hypochlorite daily and the microbiological quality was evaluated before and after chlorination the costs and operational challenges of assembling using and maintaining the hssfs were analysed in terms of facilitating technology transfer in rural communities in developing countries 2 materials and methods four hssfs were tested two in continuous flow and two in intermittent flow in duplicate as an improved version of the hssfs investigated by terin and sabogal paz 2019 including the disinfection system of filtered water using sodium hypochlorite hssf had a daily production of 48 l each hssfs were tested with and without a ripening agent river water for biological layer maturation research steps are described in table 1 2 1 stage 1 construction modified polyvinylchloride mpvc pipe used in water supply networks with a nominal diameter of 250 mm was used to form the hssf body pvc pipes and fittings were used to complete the filter structure the filtering surface was covered with a non woven synthetic blanket 100 polyester of 2 8 mm thickness a drawing of the prototypes in continuous c hssf1 and c hssf2 and intermittent i hssf3 and i hssf4 flows is shown in fig 1 filtering material was obtained from construction local stores washed with well water dried in the sun and sieved as recommended by cawst 2012 granulometric tests were applied according to brazilian standard nbr 11799 abnt 2016 a support layer consisted of 7 5 cm of coarse gravel 12 15 mm 2 6 g cm 3 density and 41 porosity 5 cm of fine gravel 5 8 mm 2 7 g cm 3 density and 44 porosity and 5 cm of coarse sand 1 5 3 mm 2 6 g cm 3 density and 45 porosity the upper layer consisted of 50 cm of fine sand 0 075 1 0 mm d10 0 19 mm uc 2 08 0 16 0 1 mm 2 7 g cm 3 density and 37 porosity c hssfs and i hssfs were operated at filtration rates of 0 91 m3 m 2 day 1 and between 0 to 8 64 m3 m 2 day 1 respectively in order to estimate the total volume of water stored in the filter the sum of the stationary water volume in the upper layer of the filter medium was added with the void volume of the filter layers and the internal volume of the filtered water outlet pipe the volume of the layers multiplied by the porosity of the respective materials was considered when calculating the void volume after assembling each empty prototype was weighed the estimated weight of the filled hssf was obtained considering the specific masses volumes and porosities of the filtering material material costs used in the filters were calculated according to three different budgets in são paulo state brazil in january 2020 2 2 stage 2 characterization after assembling the filters tracer tests were conducted to analyse the flow of each prototype a 100 mg l 1 sodium chloride nacl solution was used as a tracer and the conductivity of the filtered water was recorded by the logger lite program vernier sofware technology usa the tests were performed in triplicate for each filter in the i hssf tests two 16 l feeds of the salt solution were added followed by two batches of the same volume with water from the well to remove the whole tracer the tracer versus filtrate volume curves were obtained as in elliott et al 2008 and bradley et al 2011 moreover the morrill dispersion index mdi and modified morrill dispersion index mmdi proposed by lynn et al 2013 were calculated in the c hssfs nacl solution fed the filter and the recording of the tracer concentration in the filtered water over time enabled the analysis of the degree model according to levenspiel 1999 data were normalized by curve f and derived curve e by origin 8 6 software originlab eua likewise the residence time the correlation of the results the n continuous stirred tank reactors n cstrs and the analysis of the experimental curves for the distribution of hydraulic retention time with the uniparametric theoretical models small and large dispersion were also calculated 2 3 stage 3 operation the 4 hssfs were fed over 374 days which were divided into two phases the first operation phase comprehended the first 246 days and the filters were fed only with studied water the hssfs were cleaned and the operation was restarted the second phase lasted 128 days and included accelerating the growth of the biological layer by replacing the studied water weekly with river water river water was used as a ripening agent and the equivalent of one void volume was introduced into the filter studied water was a mixture of well water and escherichia coli atcc 11229 a lyophilized e coli strain was activated replicated and cultivated periodically in nutrient medium 70122 nutrient broth n 1 sigma aldrich for an approximately 10³ ufc 100ml 1 daily inoculation in the studied water a mixture of 200 l of studied water well water and e coli was prepared daily 100 l studied water was pumped into an elevated reservoir to supply the two c hssfs and the remaining water was reserved for manual feeds of the two i hssfs a needle valve corrected the filtered water flow in the i hssfs and these filters were fed 16 l three times a day i e a 14 hour break and two 5 hour breaks filling the bucket installed on top of each filter fig 1 temperature filtration rate turbidity dissolved oxygen do ph and total organic carbon toc were analysed according to the methodologies of apha et al 2012 microbiological analyses of e coli were performed by the membrane filtration technique with growth in chromocult coliform agar merck kgaa a disinfection system was joined to the filtered water outlet by a 50 l reservoir and a 2 sodium hypochlorite solution was dosed towards maintaining 0 5 mg l 1 of residual chlorine daily the free chlorine concentration was measured using the chlorine reagent kit hach tm 2105569 br after the first phase the 4 hssfs were cleaned to match the conditions for the beginning of the new operation i e without schmutzdecke and the procedure was i the non woven blanket was scraped and the top layer of the sand bed was removed washed and relocated ii the hssfs were filled with sodium hypochlorite 4 0 mg l 1 and kept in 2 days of contact time and iii chlorine was removed by introducing well water for 7 consecutive days in the second phase river water espraiado river são carlos sp brazil was introduced to the filters weekly to facilitate the formation of the schmutzdecke due to possible peaks of turbidity in the river water a pre treatment including sedimentation for 24 h and a passage of river water through a non woven blanket 100 polyester and 2 8 mm thickness were applied this pre treated river water replaced 16 l of the studied water in each hssf weekly i e volume corresponding to approximately once the void volume ten days before the end of the first phase giardia muris cysts and cryptosporidium parvum oocysts were inoculated daily directly into the stationary zone of the hssfs i e liquid over the fine sand top protozoa suspensions were purchased from waterbornetm usa prior inoculation a 5 µl aliquot of each suspension was evaluated under a microscope bx51 olympus in triplicate to know the number of oo cysts to inoculate approximately 500 oo cysts per each hssf a sample concentration was performed by membrane filtration for protozoa detection in filtered water according to a protocol described in franco et al 2016 in this case samples passed through a membrane of mixed cellulose esters 3 μm porosity and diameter 47 mm which were scraped with tween 80 0 1 heated to 45 c collected content from the membrane was centrifuged at 1500xg for 15 min next the supernatant was discarded leaving 0 5 ml the pellet was resuspended 50 µl aliquot of the resuspended pellet 0 5 ml was prepared on microscopic slides and consequently a multiplication factor of 10 for each oo cyst detected was applied slides were evaluated using a commercial kit merifluor meridian bioscience usa with an addition of 4 6 diamino 2 phenyl indole dapi fluoroshield sigma aldrich and propidium iodide pi sigma aldrich the oo cysts were counted by fluorescence microscopy bx51 olympus microscope combined with confirmatory tests in dapi and differential interferential contrast dic an analytical quality assay validated the protozoa detection method when evaluating the target organisms recoveries according to usepa 2012 four 1 l filtered water samples were inoculated with a known number of oo cysts using an accuspyke kit waterbornetm usa and a blank test recovery percentages were calculated by the proportion between the quantified organisms and those present in the sample protozoa inoculation and reduction efficiency in hssf started on the last days of the first phase ripe filter and in better operating conditions and during the whole second phase protozoa inactivation by chlorine disinfection was evaluated in the last two months of hssf operation in the second phase the oo cyst viability was estimated according to the permeability of the parasite membrane using pi as vital dye in each test the filtered water produced in one day by each filter 48l was divided into two equal parts 24 l and one of them received chlorine dosage to assess the disinfection performance in relation to parasite inactivation the 24 l without chlorine evaluated the hssf performance in removing inactivating oo cysts after that the protozoa detection method was applied to both 24 l samples above and positive oo cysts for pi stained and negative oo cysts for pi unstained were counted 2 4 applied statistics hssf performance was statistically analysed by the past program palaeontological statistics manufactured by hammer et al 2001 and the normality of the data checked by shapiro wilk test with 95 confidence interval when the data were non parametric the c hssf and i hssf efficiencies and the comparison between the disinfected filtered water were compared using the mann whitney non parametric test bivariate analysis checked the correlation between e coli reduction efficiency in filtered water for different operation phases with temperature to do this the spearman correlation coefficient for non parametric analyses was used with 95 confidence interval 3 results and discussion 3 1 hssf construction the construction of the filter included cutting chamfering drilling and sealing the parts a plumber or a bricklayer normally uses tools and skills needed to build a filter it should be noted that the hssf version reported by smith 2013 required skills in cutting and folding the material used therefore communities must have professionals who are experts in making the proposed prototype the hssf body weight was 13 kg and it reached 92 kg when filter media was introduced according to the results the tested prototypes were lighter than other existing hssfs cawst 2010 smith 2013 facilitating the movement of the prototype for field tests nevertheless hssf became 7 times heavier after the granular media had been introduced in this context the empty hssf must be transported to the final place inside the residence before being filled by the filtering materials napotnik and jellison 2014 stated that both transport and movement of the finished hssf with body and filter media can reduce the filtration rate by the filter bed compaction hssf estimated costs filter media filter body pipes valves and fittings were us 76 for i hssf and us 98 for c hssf in january 2020 for a family with a us 250 monthly income equivalent to a minimum wage in brazil in 2020 our hssf prototypes correspond to at least 2 5 of the annual income in nepal for example the cawst hssf model costs were 15 of the annual income yung 2003 according to maciel and sabogal paz 2020 their prototypes had a cost of us 97 per unit which was a similar value in our study water stored in the i hssfs was 16 24 l sum of stationary water volume void volume and internal volume in the hssf outlet pipe introducing a feeding volume smaller than the void volume is recommended for a microbiological reduction elliott et al 2008 therefore each filter was fed three times per day with 16 l on the other hand water stored in the c hssfs was 18 9 l this value divided by the daily flow resulted in a theoretical hydraulic retention time of 567 34 min that was later compared with the tracer tests 3 2 characterization of hssfs the results of the tracer assays on c hssfs and i hssfs are shown in fig 2 the graphs obtained in i hssfs are similar to those found by elliott et al 2008 with an average vertical line close to the accumulated volume of 32 l two feeds a change in the tracer concentration can also be observed introducing well water that aims to remove it regarding mdi the values were 2 19 0 01 for i hssf3 and 2 21 0 07 for i hssf4 this index considers the passage time of 10 and 90 of the tracer mass in the filter therefore when closer to 1 0 it is close to the ideal plug flow reactor usepa 1986 and tchobanoglous et al 2003 consider mdi 2 a plug flow reactor the hssf model studied by elliot et al 2008 bradley et al 2011 and yong rojanschi and madramootoo 2015 obtained mdi values of 1 3 1 4 and 1 8 respectively according to the flow rate variation in the i hssf model studied by lynn et al 2013 they adapted the mdi to the mmdi i e index that took into account the accumulated volume of filtered water and found values around 2 9 in our study the mmdi was 2 47 0 03 for i hssf3 and 2 56 0 13 for i hssf4 values close to those found by lynn et al 2013 the residence time distribution was 578 4 4 min for c hssf1 and 578 9 3 min for c hssf2 these values are close to the theoretical hydraulic retention time 567 34 min previously shown data adjustment for the n continuous stirred tank reactors model and for the low and high dispersion intensity models are shown in table 2 the n cstr model provided the best results in both prototypes therefore 8 perfect complete mix reactors in series are required for c hssf1 and 13 are necessary for c hssf2 the c hssf model tested by terin and sabogal paz 2019 obtained n 6 filter cross sectional area 0 049 m2 and the one tested by sabogal paz et al 2020 yielded n 17 filter cross sectional area 0 0075 m2 therefore the difference in results may be associated with the filters geometry the largest number of reactors in series indicates a reactor close to the plug flow levenspiel 1999 when evaluating the development of the biological layer in the hssf sabogal paz et al 2020 suggested that the plug flow reactor may allow the same treatment time to be available for all water parcels that enter the filter improving the performance of the hssf 3 3 hssf operation e coli reductions are shown in fig 3 the data showed that c hssfs displayed stability ripening after 100 days with around 3 log reductions in the first operation phase in the second phase the same efficiency was achieved in approximately 20 days i hssf had almost 1 5 log reduction in the first operation phase however the weekly inclusion of river water i e ripening agent in the second phase increased the efficiency of i hssf in reducing microorganisms i e close to 2 log the application of the wilcoxon statistical test to compare the e coli data from filtered water resulted in p values of 0 018 between continuous filters and 0 264 between intermittent filters the same test between the different hssf configurations resulted in significantly lower values indicating the similarity between the duplicates bivariate statistical analyses between the operation time and e coli reduction showed a correlation p 0 05 in the first 20 days of operation in all hssfs in the second phase and only in c hssf1 in the first phase this indicates that there was a speed up of filter performance in the second phase maciel and sabogal paz 2020 in their bivariate analyses also observed that the time after hssf maintenance correlated positively with microbiological removal based on their data young rojanschi and madramootoo 2014 proposed modelling e coli reduction as a function of time for hssfs in continuous and intermittent flows for each hssf the aforementioned authors considered the initial reduction in bacteria a the reduction after ripening b and the ripening factor characteristic c the results obtained from our data are shown in table 3 after applying the aforementioned modelling c hssfs showed greater e coli reductions than i hssfs at the beginning of the first and second phases at the end of the same phases bacterial reductions increased in all filters however showing a better performance for c hssfs c hssfs presented a filtration rate about 10 times lower than i hssfs and this lower filtration rate may have helped the adsorption filtration and microbiological treatment processes in our study it is possible that the second phase the microbiological mechanisms i e faster schmutzdecke formation helped to reduce e coli the ripening factor of all hssfs was significantly higher in the first phase than in the second therefore the river water use as a ripening agent changed the e coli reduction curve decreasing the ripening factor in the modelling performed by young rojanschi and madramootoo 2014 with lake water as influent water ripening factors of 2 to 4 were obtained in intermittent and continuous hssfs respectively disinfection with sodium hypochlorite led to a reduction in the remaining e coli in the filtered water in all hssfs analysed they were no longer detected hussain et al 2015 also achieved a total coliform reduction evaluating the hssf followed by solar disinfection e coli data of filtered water in the first week of hssf operation were compared between the two phases the mann whitney test resulted in values of p 0 698 for all hssfs therefore it is emphasised that cleaning the hssf leaves the filter in conditions close to the beginning of the operation in both studied phases toc removal for each hssf over the two phases is shown in fig 4 the toc of influent water was 6 8 0 96 mg l 1 in the first phase and 7 96 1 21 mg l 1 in the second in this case the first phase showed 30 toc removal after 140 operation days in the c hssf1 and only after 176 days in the c hssf2 on the other hand the second phase achieved the same performance after 29 operation days in c hssfs and 99 days in i hssfs campos et al 2002 affirmed that the unstable organic carbon in slow sand filtration could be used by microorganisms for microbial biomass grow thus providing its removal in our study the second phase which included the ripening agent river water to speed up the biological layer growth reduced the time to obtain 30 toc removal i e 111 operation days for c hssf1 147 days for c hssf2 and 77 days for both i hssf3 and i hssf4 when compared to the first phase disinfected water showed toc removal similar to filtered water for all the hssfs and the mann whitney statistical test revealed no significant differences p values 0 67 for c hssf1 0 63 for c hssf2 0 51 for i hssf3 and 0 96 for i hssf4 monitored parameters throughout the operating time turbidity ph temperature head loss and filtration rate are summarized in table 4 in the first phase the turbidity was 0 53 0 13 ntu for the studied water despite low values filtered water samples presented removal with values of 9 5 41 in c hssf1 8 7 36 in c hssf2 14 8 36 in i hssf3 and 16 5 42 in i hssf4 in general when influent water turbidity is low the removal is also low sabogal paz et al 2020 the mann whitney statistical test detected significant differences between filtered and chlorinated water only in c hssf1 in the second phase the studied water showed 0 62 0 41 ntu turbidity and the filtered and chlorinated water presented higher values this increase was due to the ripening agent river water introduced weekly with 21 07 25 32 ntu however only one day per week were there turbidity peaks of a maximum of 4 28 ntu in c hssfs and 12 3 ntu in i hssfs and the others days the filtered and chlorinated water remained below 1 0 ntu regarding ph the filtered water of the c hssfs showed slightly higher values than those of i hssfs filter media leaching as pointed out by sabogal paz et al 2020 can explain the ph increase disinfection altered the ph values however the treated water was within the recommended range between 6 5 and 8 5 who 2017 hssfs internal temperature was higher in the second phase than the first as the room temperature was 24 3 7 c in the first phase and 26 1 2 2 c in the second filter ripening is known to improve at higher temperatures unger and collins 2006 arnold et al 2016 therefore the temperature between phases may have influenced our results with favourable conditions to speed up the biological layer in the second phase nevertheless this difference was very low 2 c and bivariate statistical analyses between the values of e coli reduction and temperature showed no correlation p 0 05 head losses and filtration rates varied slightly over time as low values of standard deviations were found the variation head loss in relation to the filter media thickness dh l 1 was higher for i hssfs than c hssfs it should be noted that the low flow rate of c hssfs 33 ml min 1 resulted in a small head loss variation between the piezometers i e in order of millimetres while the instant high flow rate of i hssf 300 ml min 1 caused high head loss variation among piezometers i e in order of centimetres young rojanschi and madramootoo 2014 also observed this difference in hssfs and they point out that the piezometers of the filters in continuous flow were not sensitive enough to detect the head loss the particle size of the studied water was 909 298 nm in the first phase and 354 140 nm in the second phase however filtered water showed a slight variation of this parameter table 4 do analyses in the filter depth are shown in fig 5 lower do concentrations were found close to the surface indicating consumption by the schmutzdecke do values were reduced with the depth and young rojanschi and madramootoo 2015 observed this phenomenon do profiles are similar between duplicates c hssf1 versus c hssf2 and i hssf3 versus i hssf4 and different between continuous and intermittent flow configurations with higher values for c hssfs the pause periods may explain the higher do consumption in i hssfs do profile in the initial 21 days of the first phase showed a different layout from the other days in all hssfs on the other hand in the second phase the do layout for the same period was similar in this case there were differences in the do profile between the phases in which the second phase had a do profile closer to the days when the hssf was mature in the first days of operation according to adin 2003 do concentration can be an excellent indicator for the biological layer ripening the analytical quality test for the protozoan detection method is shown in table 5 when the results are compared with the criteria established by usepa 2012 the data obtained met the minimum recovery of 22 for giardia but it did not meet the variation coefficient of 39 for cryptosporidium the method did not meet the minimum of 38 recovery and met the variation coefficient of 37 when performing analytical quality tests of a similar protocol to the one used in our research maciel and sabogal paz 2016 found recoveries of 80 20 4 for giardia spp and 5 200 for c parvum indicating a variability of the protozoa detection according to the tested environmental matrix hssf efficiency to protozoa reduction was performed when the filters were mature near the end of the operation the results are shown in table 6 the maximum protozoa reductions occurred at the end of the first season obtaining a total removal 5 log of g muris in all hssfs and 1 67 log to total removal 5 log of c parvum the end of the second phase also showed a total reduction of cysts in c hssf1 c hssf2 and i hssf3 but not for i hssf4 i e 1 55 log the results suggest that a filter mature has a higher performance in protozoa reduction due to the microbiological treatment promoted by the schmutzdecke palmateer et al 1999 achieved a reduction of 99 98 3 log of cryptosporidium and 100 5log of giardia after 22 days of massive inoculation in i hssf model although the hssfs significantly reduced the amount of pathogens in the water they did not guarantee a complete reduction mainly for c parvum due to its small size and ability to compress when it passes through the filter bed giglio and sabogal paz 2018 thus suitable disinfection is required higher bacterial reduction compared with protozoa may be explained by the fact that giardia and cryptosporidium are present in their resistance form cysts and oocysts respectively when in the environment usually these forms show a double layered membrane protecting the parasites from adverse external conditions consequently they can tolerate the filtration process stress i e predation competition and lack of nutrients with less impact than bacteria ramo et al 2017 berglund et al 2017 in addition the initial concentration of microorganisms inoculated in the study water may have influenced the efficiency of the filter since a high reduction of oo cysts was observed when a high concentration of them was inoculated in the water as reported by palmateer et al 1999 and adeyemo et al 2015 thus low concentration in raw water may underestimate the real protozoa removal rates the protozoan membrane permeability was evaluated using pi as an indicator of the viability of the protozoa and the results are shown in fig 6 at the end of the second phase potentially viable unstained g muris cysts were detected in 25 of the filtered water samples and in 20 of the disinfected water samples in the hssfs potentially viable c parvum oocysts were detected in 60 of filtered water and 12 of disinfected water samples the findings indicated that the disinfection reduced the amount of protozoa viable i e 5 for cysts and 48 for oocysts therefore exposure to chlorine may have altered the membrane permeability contributing to the water treatment however the existence of uncolored oo cysts in disinfected water shows that chlorination was not fully efficient in removing the microbiological risk chlorine doses even higher than the one used in our study i e 0 5 mg l 1 do not inactivate oocysts completely according to keegan et al 2008 on the other hand pi can also underestimate the treatment efficiency as non viable cells may be negative for pi roussean et al 2018 regarding protozoa reduction more research is needed to provide safe water to the target population the main challenges observed in our study during the routine hssf operation aiming at technology transfer in rural areas were i the change in the quality of filtered water on the day of the addition of when the ripening agent i e river water was added ii risks of chlorine splashing on clothes during disinfection and iii maintaining the three daily feeding commitments for the i hssfs an alternative to motivate user acceptance for weekly river water feeds ripening agent introduction would be to reserve the water from that day for less noble purposes e g general cleaning since on that day the water quality is poor when disinfecting using gloves and aprons and training the user can minimize any problems the daily hssf operation routine requires discipline and commitment from the user evidently these behaviour changes require training monitoring and follow up as observed by vanderzwaag et al 2009 and sisson et al 2013 4 conclusions c hssfs efficiency was better than i hssfs in reducing the microbiological risk found in groundwater the weekly feeding of hssfs with river water accelerated the ripening process in approximately 80 days thus improving the treatment efficiency compared to the operation without the ripening agent disinfection with sodium hypochlorite improved the quality of the filtered water and generated an increase in the protozoa membrane permeability

provide safe water however hssfs require time for the growth of the biological layer schmutzdecke to achieve maximum performance especially when groundwater is used as it normally has few nutrients in this ripening period pathogenic microorganisms can pass through the filter in this context this study reports the performance of two hssf settings intermittent i hssf and continuous c hssf flows followed by disinfection with sodium hypochlorite to treat groundwater with escherichia coli giardia muris cysts and cryptosporidium parvum oocysts the weekly introduction of river water was tested as a filter ripening agent and this procedure reduced the ripening time in approximately 80 days filtered water disinfection improved the water quality and inactivated protozoa the costs and operational challenges addressed in this study can provide support to hssf technology transfer in rural communities worldwide graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords social technology pathogens schmutzdecke disinfection drinking water slow sand filtration 1 introduction almost a fifth of the world s population does not have access to water supply services mainly in rural areas and suburban regions pinderhughes 2004 untreated groundwater catchment for consumption is common in these areas precarious conditions of use and conservation of wells can contaminate drinking water causing health problems to the supplied community water treatments in a household level are essential to ensure human rights to safe water established by the united nations un unga 2015 consumption of contaminated water usually leads to diarrhoea that can cause approximately 485 000 deaths per year in low to medium income countries who 2019 diarrhoea and pneumonia are the two main causes of infant mortality who 2013 the presence of pathogens i e protozoa bacteria and viruses in drinking water is a health risk especially regarding the adverse events caused by climate changes which represent a threat from outbreaks of infectious diseases transmitted by water efstratiou et al 2017 protozoa more specifically giardia spp and cryptosporidium spp are responsible for gastrointestinal diseases with outbreaks recorded in several locations worldwide efstratiou et al 2017 observed 82 of the documented outbreaks between 2011 and 2016 reporting water supply system problems as the transmission route according to jadhav et al 2015 a household water treatment system can reduce the risk of waterborne disease transmission as well as best practices such as water source protection and safe storage household water treatment should be accessible to anyone easy to operate and maintain as well as culturally accepted das et al 2015 reported the difficulty of breaking habits and convincing communities to accept interventions for groundwater treatment when untreated water appears visually clear among the efforts for developing technologies adapted to local contexts is the so called point of use pou sobsey et al 2008 or household water treatment and safe storage hwts eawag and sandec 2008 in the 1990s david manz adapted the conventional slow sand filter for household level and intermittent flow which resulted in the household slow sand filter hssf this technology has been spread by several organizations and over 300 000 hssfs have been installed in more than 69 countries cawst 2012 hssf consists of combining physical and biological processes according to jadhav et al 2015 physical mechanisms include the retention of larger particles in the pores of the filter medium and adsorption which enable organic removal whereas the biological mechanisms include predation elimination natural death inactivation and partial reduction of organic carbon due to the microorganism metabolism therefore hssf treats water by combining physical processes with biological activity present on the sand filter surface schmutzdecke nevertheless achieving optimum technology performance requires a ripening period for the biological layer growth especially when groundwater is used in general groundwater has few nutrients when compared to surface water maciel and sabogal paz 2020 during the ripening time the treatment efficiency is reduced thus increasing the risk of pathogens passing through the pores of the filter media speeding up of the ripening period in hssf to treat groundwater is essential for safe water supply however ripening poses as a challenge especially considering simple solutions adapted to isolated communities in developing countries calixto et al 2020 according to bradley et al 2011 hssf can significantly increase the ripening time i e up to 200 days when groundwater is treated it should be noted that the hssf performance changes due to filter cleaning as biological layer growth is required thus filtered water must be disinfected for both the ripening period and complete maturing studies have aimed at optimizing hssf performance introducing biomass in the filter layer baig et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 calixto et al 2020 or iron oxide tellen et al 2010 bradley et al 2011 ahammed and davra 2011 comparisons are also made between different flows e g continuous and intermittent young rojanschi and madramootoo 2014 maciel and sabogal paz 2020 sabogal paz et al 2020 and the structure of the filter body in different materials such as concrete and plastic stauber et al 2012 arnold 2015 it is important to highlight that stored filtered water can be contaminated due to hygiene habits and the type of storage used by the user as observed by duke et al 2006 therefore disinfection of drinking water is required specifically in household disinfection with chlorine up to 6 log of bacteria or viruses and up to 5 log of some protozoa can be removed as long as the water turbidity remains below 1 0 ut who 2017 who 2019 highlights the importance of specific chlorine dosage in water for each location based on the chlorine demand in the water to be treated and also monitoring to ensure the maintenance of free chlorine concentrations between 0 2 and 0 5 mg l 1 chlorination with sodium hypochlorite is commonly used for water disinfection however this technology generates by products and is not always accepted by isolated communities due to changes in both taste and odour of water schmidt and cairncross 2009 this is often aggravated when chlorine is incorrectly applied i e excessive dosage by the population boiling water is a common technique in rural communities to obtain safe water clasen et al 2008 however the volume of treated water is limited 5 0 l day 1 and energy consumption gas electricity and wood can be considerable and even economically unfeasible in this context hssf followed by chlorination may be more practical than boiling filtered water moreover chlorinated water remains safe for a longer time considering this background this study evaluated the performance of two models of hssfs in full scale and in duplicate two filters in continuous flow and two filters in intermittent flow for the treatment of groundwater containing high concentrations of e coli g muris cysts and c parvum oocysts situation that can happen for example by leaking septic tanks two operation phases were evaluated with and without ripening agents river water to speed up the hssf ripening ripening consisted of a controlled introduction of river water to the filters for providing nutrients and improved conditions for developing the biological layer in a short time the ripening agent was selected because it can be easily accessible in rural areas thus river water emerged as a possible solution for an exploratory study when groundwater is used for supply and hssf as a treatment rapid biological layer ripening of the filter is essential in order to reduce the microbiological risk of the effluent in our study filtered water was disinfected with sodium hypochlorite daily and the microbiological quality was evaluated before and after chlorination the costs and operational challenges of assembling using and maintaining the hssfs were analysed in terms of facilitating technology transfer in rural communities in developing countries 2 materials and methods four hssfs were tested two in continuous flow and two in intermittent flow in duplicate as an improved version of the hssfs investigated by terin and sabogal paz 2019 including the disinfection system of filtered water using sodium hypochlorite hssf had a daily production of 48 l each hssfs were tested with and without a ripening agent river water for biological layer maturation research steps are described in table 1 2 1 stage 1 construction modified polyvinylchloride mpvc pipe used in water supply networks with a nominal diameter of 250 mm was used to form the hssf body pvc pipes and fittings were used to complete the filter structure the filtering surface was covered with a non woven synthetic blanket 100 polyester of 2 8 mm thickness a drawing of the prototypes in continuous c hssf1 and c hssf2 and intermittent i hssf3 and i hssf4 flows is shown in fig 1 filtering material was obtained from construction local stores washed with well water dried in the sun and sieved as recommended by cawst 2012 granulometric tests were applied according to brazilian standard nbr 11799 abnt 2016 a support layer consisted of 7 5 cm of coarse gravel 12 15 mm 2 6 g cm 3 density and 41 porosity 5 cm of fine gravel 5 8 mm 2 7 g cm 3 density and 44 porosity and 5 cm of coarse sand 1 5 3 mm 2 6 g cm 3 density and 45 porosity the upper layer consisted of 50 cm of fine sand 0 075 1 0 mm d10 0 19 mm uc 2 08 0 16 0 1 mm 2 7 g cm 3 density and 37 porosity c hssfs and i hssfs were operated at filtration rates of 0 91 m3 m 2 day 1 and between 0 to 8 64 m3 m 2 day 1 respectively in order to estimate the total volume of water stored in the filter the sum of the stationary water volume in the upper layer of the filter medium was added with the void volume of the filter layers and the internal volume of the filtered water outlet pipe the volume of the layers multiplied by the porosity of the respective materials was considered when calculating the void volume after assembling each empty prototype was weighed the estimated weight of the filled hssf was obtained considering the specific masses volumes and porosities of the filtering material material costs used in the filters were calculated according to three different budgets in são paulo state brazil in january 2020 2 2 stage 2 characterization after assembling the filters tracer tests were conducted to analyse the flow of each prototype a 100 mg l 1 sodium chloride nacl solution was used as a tracer and the conductivity of the filtered water was recorded by the logger lite program vernier sofware technology usa the tests were performed in triplicate for each filter in the i hssf tests two 16 l feeds of the salt solution were added followed by two batches of the same volume with water from the well to remove the whole tracer the tracer versus filtrate volume curves were obtained as in elliott et al 2008 and bradley et al 2011 moreover the morrill dispersion index mdi and modified morrill dispersion index mmdi proposed by lynn et al 2013 were calculated in the c hssfs nacl solution fed the filter and the recording of the tracer concentration in the filtered water over time enabled the analysis of the degree model according to levenspiel 1999 data were normalized by curve f and derived curve e by origin 8 6 software originlab eua likewise the residence time the correlation of the results the n continuous stirred tank reactors n cstrs and the analysis of the experimental curves for the distribution of hydraulic retention time with the uniparametric theoretical models small and large dispersion were also calculated 2 3 stage 3 operation the 4 hssfs were fed over 374 days which were divided into two phases the first operation phase comprehended the first 246 days and the filters were fed only with studied water the hssfs were cleaned and the operation was restarted the second phase lasted 128 days and included accelerating the growth of the biological layer by replacing the studied water weekly with river water river water was used as a ripening agent and the equivalent of one void volume was introduced into the filter studied water was a mixture of well water and escherichia coli atcc 11229 a lyophilized e coli strain was activated replicated and cultivated periodically in nutrient medium 70122 nutrient broth n 1 sigma aldrich for an approximately 10³ ufc 100ml 1 daily inoculation in the studied water a mixture of 200 l of studied water well water and e coli was prepared daily 100 l studied water was pumped into an elevated reservoir to supply the two c hssfs and the remaining water was reserved for manual feeds of the two i hssfs a needle valve corrected the filtered water flow in the i hssfs and these filters were fed 16 l three times a day i e a 14 hour break and two 5 hour breaks filling the bucket installed on top of each filter fig 1 temperature filtration rate turbidity dissolved oxygen do ph and total organic carbon toc were analysed according to the methodologies of apha et al 2012 microbiological analyses of e coli were performed by the membrane filtration technique with growth in chromocult coliform agar merck kgaa a disinfection system was joined to the filtered water outlet by a 50 l reservoir and a 2 sodium hypochlorite solution was dosed towards maintaining 0 5 mg l 1 of residual chlorine daily the free chlorine concentration was measured using the chlorine reagent kit hach tm 2105569 br after the first phase the 4 hssfs were cleaned to match the conditions for the beginning of the new operation i e without schmutzdecke and the procedure was i the non woven blanket was scraped and the top layer of the sand bed was removed washed and relocated ii the hssfs were filled with sodium hypochlorite 4 0 mg l 1 and kept in 2 days of contact time and iii chlorine was removed by introducing well water for 7 consecutive days in the second phase river water espraiado river são carlos sp brazil was introduced to the filters weekly to facilitate the formation of the schmutzdecke due to possible peaks of turbidity in the river water a pre treatment including sedimentation for 24 h and a passage of river water through a non woven blanket 100 polyester and 2 8 mm thickness were applied this pre treated river water replaced 16 l of the studied water in each hssf weekly i e volume corresponding to approximately once the void volume ten days before the end of the first phase giardia muris cysts and cryptosporidium parvum oocysts were inoculated daily directly into the stationary zone of the hssfs i e liquid over the fine sand top protozoa suspensions were purchased from waterbornetm usa prior inoculation a 5 µl aliquot of each suspension was evaluated under a microscope bx51 olympus in triplicate to know the number of oo cysts to inoculate approximately 500 oo cysts per each hssf a sample concentration was performed by membrane filtration for protozoa detection in filtered water according to a protocol described in franco et al 2016 in this case samples passed through a membrane of mixed cellulose esters 3 μm porosity and diameter 47 mm which were scraped with tween 80 0 1 heated to 45 c collected content from the membrane was centrifuged at 1500xg for 15 min next the supernatant was discarded leaving 0 5 ml the pellet was resuspended 50 µl aliquot of the resuspended pellet 0 5 ml was prepared on microscopic slides and consequently a multiplication factor of 10 for each oo cyst detected was applied slides were evaluated using a commercial kit merifluor meridian bioscience usa with an addition of 4 6 diamino 2 phenyl indole dapi fluoroshield sigma aldrich and propidium iodide pi sigma aldrich the oo cysts were counted by fluorescence microscopy bx51 olympus microscope combined with confirmatory tests in dapi and differential interferential contrast dic an analytical quality assay validated the protozoa detection method when evaluating the target organisms recoveries according to usepa 2012 four 1 l filtered water samples were inoculated with a known number of oo cysts using an accuspyke kit waterbornetm usa and a blank test recovery percentages were calculated by the proportion between the quantified organisms and those present in the sample protozoa inoculation and reduction efficiency in hssf started on the last days of the first phase ripe filter and in better operating conditions and during the whole second phase protozoa inactivation by chlorine disinfection was evaluated in the last two months of hssf operation in the second phase the oo cyst viability was estimated according to the permeability of the parasite membrane using pi as vital dye in each test the filtered water produced in one day by each filter 48l was divided into two equal parts 24 l and one of them received chlorine dosage to assess the disinfection performance in relation to parasite inactivation the 24 l without chlorine evaluated the hssf performance in removing inactivating oo cysts after that the protozoa detection method was applied to both 24 l samples above and positive oo cysts for pi stained and negative oo cysts for pi unstained were counted 2 4 applied statistics hssf performance was statistically analysed by the past program palaeontological statistics manufactured by hammer et al 2001 and the normality of the data checked by shapiro wilk test with 95 confidence interval when the data were non parametric the c hssf and i hssf efficiencies and the comparison between the disinfected filtered water were compared using the mann whitney non parametric test bivariate analysis checked the correlation between e coli reduction efficiency in filtered water for different operation phases with temperature to do this the spearman correlation coefficient for non parametric analyses was used with 95 confidence interval 3 results and discussion 3 1 hssf construction the construction of the filter included cutting chamfering drilling and sealing the parts a plumber or a bricklayer normally uses tools and skills needed to build a filter it should be noted that the hssf version reported by smith 2013 required skills in cutting and folding the material used therefore communities must have professionals who are experts in making the proposed prototype the hssf body weight was 13 kg and it reached 92 kg when filter media was introduced according to the results the tested prototypes were lighter than other existing hssfs cawst 2010 smith 2013 facilitating the movement of the prototype for field tests nevertheless hssf became 7 times heavier after the granular media had been introduced in this context the empty hssf must be transported to the final place inside the residence before being filled by the filtering materials napotnik and jellison 2014 stated that both transport and movement of the finished hssf with body and filter media can reduce the filtration rate by the filter bed compaction hssf estimated costs filter media filter body pipes valves and fittings were us 76 for i hssf and us 98 for c hssf in january 2020 for a family with a us 250 monthly income equivalent to a minimum wage in brazil in 2020 our hssf prototypes correspond to at least 2 5 of the annual income in nepal for example the cawst hssf model costs were 15 of the annual income yung 2003 according to maciel and sabogal paz 2020 their prototypes had a cost of us 97 per unit which was a similar value in our study water stored in the i hssfs was 16 24 l sum of stationary water volume void volume and internal volume in the hssf outlet pipe introducing a feeding volume smaller than the void volume is recommended for a microbiological reduction elliott et al 2008 therefore each filter was fed three times per day with 16 l on the other hand water stored in the c hssfs was 18 9 l this value divided by the daily flow resulted in a theoretical hydraulic retention time of 567 34 min that was later compared with the tracer tests 3 2 characterization of hssfs the results of the tracer assays on c hssfs and i hssfs are shown in fig 2 the graphs obtained in i hssfs are similar to those found by elliott et al 2008 with an average vertical line close to the accumulated volume of 32 l two feeds a change in the tracer concentration can also be observed introducing well water that aims to remove it regarding mdi the values were 2 19 0 01 for i hssf3 and 2 21 0 07 for i hssf4 this index considers the passage time of 10 and 90 of the tracer mass in the filter therefore when closer to 1 0 it is close to the ideal plug flow reactor usepa 1986 and tchobanoglous et al 2003 consider mdi 2 a plug flow reactor the hssf model studied by elliot et al 2008 bradley et al 2011 and yong rojanschi and madramootoo 2015 obtained mdi values of 1 3 1 4 and 1 8 respectively according to the flow rate variation in the i hssf model studied by lynn et al 2013 they adapted the mdi to the mmdi i e index that took into account the accumulated volume of filtered water and found values around 2 9 in our study the mmdi was 2 47 0 03 for i hssf3 and 2 56 0 13 for i hssf4 values close to those found by lynn et al 2013 the residence time distribution was 578 4 4 min for c hssf1 and 578 9 3 min for c hssf2 these values are close to the theoretical hydraulic retention time 567 34 min previously shown data adjustment for the n continuous stirred tank reactors model and for the low and high dispersion intensity models are shown in table 2 the n cstr model provided the best results in both prototypes therefore 8 perfect complete mix reactors in series are required for c hssf1 and 13 are necessary for c hssf2 the c hssf model tested by terin and sabogal paz 2019 obtained n 6 filter cross sectional area 0 049 m2 and the one tested by sabogal paz et al 2020 yielded n 17 filter cross sectional area 0 0075 m2 therefore the difference in results may be associated with the filters geometry the largest number of reactors in series indicates a reactor close to the plug flow levenspiel 1999 when evaluating the development of the biological layer in the hssf sabogal paz et al 2020 suggested that the plug flow reactor may allow the same treatment time to be available for all water parcels that enter the filter improving the performance of the hssf 3 3 hssf operation e coli reductions are shown in fig 3 the data showed that c hssfs displayed stability ripening after 100 days with around 3 log reductions in the first operation phase in the second phase the same efficiency was achieved in approximately 20 days i hssf had almost 1 5 log reduction in the first operation phase however the weekly inclusion of river water i e ripening agent in the second phase increased the efficiency of i hssf in reducing microorganisms i e close to 2 log the application of the wilcoxon statistical test to compare the e coli data from filtered water resulted in p values of 0 018 between continuous filters and 0 264 between intermittent filters the same test between the different hssf configurations resulted in significantly lower values indicating the similarity between the duplicates bivariate statistical analyses between the operation time and e coli reduction showed a correlation p 0 05 in the first 20 days of operation in all hssfs in the second phase and only in c hssf1 in the first phase this indicates that there was a speed up of filter performance in the second phase maciel and sabogal paz 2020 in their bivariate analyses also observed that the time after hssf maintenance correlated positively with microbiological removal based on their data young rojanschi and madramootoo 2014 proposed modelling e coli reduction as a function of time for hssfs in continuous and intermittent flows for each hssf the aforementioned authors considered the initial reduction in bacteria a the reduction after ripening b and the ripening factor characteristic c the results obtained from our data are shown in table 3 after applying the aforementioned modelling c hssfs showed greater e coli reductions than i hssfs at the beginning of the first and second phases at the end of the same phases bacterial reductions increased in all filters however showing a better performance for c hssfs c hssfs presented a filtration rate about 10 times lower than i hssfs and this lower filtration rate may have helped the adsorption filtration and microbiological treatment processes in our study it is possible that the second phase the microbiological mechanisms i e faster schmutzdecke formation helped to reduce e coli the ripening factor of all hssfs was significantly higher in the first phase than in the second therefore the river water use as a ripening agent changed the e coli reduction curve decreasing the ripening factor in the modelling performed by young rojanschi and madramootoo 2014 with lake water as influent water ripening factors of 2 to 4 were obtained in intermittent and continuous hssfs respectively disinfection with sodium hypochlorite led to a reduction in the remaining e coli in the filtered water in all hssfs analysed they were no longer detected hussain et al 2015 also achieved a total coliform reduction evaluating the hssf followed by solar disinfection e coli data of filtered water in the first week of hssf operation were compared between the two phases the mann whitney test resulted in values of p 0 698 for all hssfs therefore it is emphasised that cleaning the hssf leaves the filter in conditions close to the beginning of the operation in both studied phases toc removal for each hssf over the two phases is shown in fig 4 the toc of influent water was 6 8 0 96 mg l 1 in the first phase and 7 96 1 21 mg l 1 in the second in this case the first phase showed 30 toc removal after 140 operation days in the c hssf1 and only after 176 days in the c hssf2 on the other hand the second phase achieved the same performance after 29 operation days in c hssfs and 99 days in i hssfs campos et al 2002 affirmed that the unstable organic carbon in slow sand filtration could be used by microorganisms for microbial biomass grow thus providing its removal in our study the second phase which included the ripening agent river water to speed up the biological layer growth reduced the time to obtain 30 toc removal i e 111 operation days for c hssf1 147 days for c hssf2 and 77 days for both i hssf3 and i hssf4 when compared to the first phase disinfected water showed toc removal similar to filtered water for all the hssfs and the mann whitney statistical test revealed no significant differences p values 0 67 for c hssf1 0 63 for c hssf2 0 51 for i hssf3 and 0 96 for i hssf4 monitored parameters throughout the operating time turbidity ph temperature head loss and filtration rate are summarized in table 4 in the first phase the turbidity was 0 53 0 13 ntu for the studied water despite low values filtered water samples presented removal with values of 9 5 41 in c hssf1 8 7 36 in c hssf2 14 8 36 in i hssf3 and 16 5 42 in i hssf4 in general when influent water turbidity is low the removal is also low sabogal paz et al 2020 the mann whitney statistical test detected significant differences between filtered and chlorinated water only in c hssf1 in the second phase the studied water showed 0 62 0 41 ntu turbidity and the filtered and chlorinated water presented higher values this increase was due to the ripening agent river water introduced weekly with 21 07 25 32 ntu however only one day per week were there turbidity peaks of a maximum of 4 28 ntu in c hssfs and 12 3 ntu in i hssfs and the others days the filtered and chlorinated water remained below 1 0 ntu regarding ph the filtered water of the c hssfs showed slightly higher values than those of i hssfs filter media leaching as pointed out by sabogal paz et al 2020 can explain the ph increase disinfection altered the ph values however the treated water was within the recommended range between 6 5 and 8 5 who 2017 hssfs internal temperature was higher in the second phase than the first as the room temperature was 24 3 7 c in the first phase and 26 1 2 2 c in the second filter ripening is known to improve at higher temperatures unger and collins 2006 arnold et al 2016 therefore the temperature between phases may have influenced our results with favourable conditions to speed up the biological layer in the second phase nevertheless this difference was very low 2 c and bivariate statistical analyses between the values of e coli reduction and temperature showed no correlation p 0 05 head losses and filtration rates varied slightly over time as low values of standard deviations were found the variation head loss in relation to the filter media thickness dh l 1 was higher for i hssfs than c hssfs it should be noted that the low flow rate of c hssfs 33 ml min 1 resulted in a small head loss variation between the piezometers i e in order of millimetres while the instant high flow rate of i hssf 300 ml min 1 caused high head loss variation among piezometers i e in order of centimetres young rojanschi and madramootoo 2014 also observed this difference in hssfs and they point out that the piezometers of the filters in continuous flow were not sensitive enough to detect the head loss the particle size of the studied water was 909 298 nm in the first phase and 354 140 nm in the second phase however filtered water showed a slight variation of this parameter table 4 do analyses in the filter depth are shown in fig 5 lower do concentrations were found close to the surface indicating consumption by the schmutzdecke do values were reduced with the depth and young rojanschi and madramootoo 2015 observed this phenomenon do profiles are similar between duplicates c hssf1 versus c hssf2 and i hssf3 versus i hssf4 and different between continuous and intermittent flow configurations with higher values for c hssfs the pause periods may explain the higher do consumption in i hssfs do profile in the initial 21 days of the first phase showed a different layout from the other days in all hssfs on the other hand in the second phase the do layout for the same period was similar in this case there were differences in the do profile between the phases in which the second phase had a do profile closer to the days when the hssf was mature in the first days of operation according to adin 2003 do concentration can be an excellent indicator for the biological layer ripening the analytical quality test for the protozoan detection method is shown in table 5 when the results are compared with the criteria established by usepa 2012 the data obtained met the minimum recovery of 22 for giardia but it did not meet the variation coefficient of 39 for cryptosporidium the method did not meet the minimum of 38 recovery and met the variation coefficient of 37 when performing analytical quality tests of a similar protocol to the one used in our research maciel and sabogal paz 2016 found recoveries of 80 20 4 for giardia spp and 5 200 for c parvum indicating a variability of the protozoa detection according to the tested environmental matrix hssf efficiency to protozoa reduction was performed when the filters were mature near the end of the operation the results are shown in table 6 the maximum protozoa reductions occurred at the end of the first season obtaining a total removal 5 log of g muris in all hssfs and 1 67 log to total removal 5 log of c parvum the end of the second phase also showed a total reduction of cysts in c hssf1 c hssf2 and i hssf3 but not for i hssf4 i e 1 55 log the results suggest that a filter mature has a higher performance in protozoa reduction due to the microbiological treatment promoted by the schmutzdecke palmateer et al 1999 achieved a reduction of 99 98 3 log of cryptosporidium and 100 5log of giardia after 22 days of massive inoculation in i hssf model although the hssfs significantly reduced the amount of pathogens in the water they did not guarantee a complete reduction mainly for c parvum due to its small size and ability to compress when it passes through the filter bed giglio and sabogal paz 2018 thus suitable disinfection is required higher bacterial reduction compared with protozoa may be explained by the fact that giardia and cryptosporidium are present in their resistance form cysts and oocysts respectively when in the environment usually these forms show a double layered membrane protecting the parasites from adverse external conditions consequently they can tolerate the filtration process stress i e predation competition and lack of nutrients with less impact than bacteria ramo et al 2017 berglund et al 2017 in addition the initial concentration of microorganisms inoculated in the study water may have influenced the efficiency of the filter since a high reduction of oo cysts was observed when a high concentration of them was inoculated in the water as reported by palmateer et al 1999 and adeyemo et al 2015 thus low concentration in raw water may underestimate the real protozoa removal rates the protozoan membrane permeability was evaluated using pi as an indicator of the viability of the protozoa and the results are shown in fig 6 at the end of the second phase potentially viable unstained g muris cysts were detected in 25 of the filtered water samples and in 20 of the disinfected water samples in the hssfs potentially viable c parvum oocysts were detected in 60 of filtered water and 12 of disinfected water samples the findings indicated that the disinfection reduced the amount of protozoa viable i e 5 for cysts and 48 for oocysts therefore exposure to chlorine may have altered the membrane permeability contributing to the water treatment however the existence of uncolored oo cysts in disinfected water shows that chlorination was not fully efficient in removing the microbiological risk chlorine doses even higher than the one used in our study i e 0 5 mg l 1 do not inactivate oocysts completely according to keegan et al 2008 on the other hand pi can also underestimate the treatment efficiency as non viable cells may be negative for pi roussean et al 2018 regarding protozoa reduction more research is needed to provide safe water to the target population the main challenges observed in our study during the routine hssf operation aiming at technology transfer in rural areas were i the change in the quality of filtered water on the day of the addition of when the ripening agent i e river water was added ii risks of chlorine splashing on clothes during disinfection and iii maintaining the three daily feeding commitments for the i hssfs an alternative to motivate user acceptance for weekly river water feeds ripening agent introduction would be to reserve the water from that day for less noble purposes e g general cleaning since on that day the water quality is poor when disinfecting using gloves and aprons and training the user can minimize any problems the daily hssf operation routine requires discipline and commitment from the user evidently these behaviour changes require training monitoring and follow up as observed by vanderzwaag et al 2009 and sisson et al 2013 4 conclusions c hssfs efficiency was better than i hssfs in reducing the microbiological risk found in groundwater the weekly feeding of hssfs with river water accelerated the ripening process in approximately 80 days thus improving the treatment efficiency compared to the operation without the ripening agent disinfection with sodium hypochlorite improved the quality of the filtered water and generated an increase in the protozoa membrane permeability despite the costs and operational challenges encountered the hssf can improve the quality of life in rural communities providing safe water worldwide declaration of competing interest the authors

17551,as an important raw material and intermediate of widely used antibiotics cefazolin and cefazedone 2 mecapto 5 methyl 1 3 4 thiadizaole mmtd in antibiotic wastewater is hardly decyclized during wastewater treatment posing great risk to the environment this work proposed a green coupling oxidation process to enhance ring opening of mmtd during antibiotic wastewater treatment in particular the significant role of humic substances hs as pre coupling reagent was emphasized real hs and different model hs especially quinones not only efficiently pre coupled mmtd 95 but also promoted the mmtd removal by mno2 from 72 4 to 92 4 mass spectrometric analysis indicated that mmtd pre coupled to hs would be oxidized with ring opening to environmental friendly sulfonated hs while direct oxidation of mmtd produced mmtd dimers or sulfonated mmtd that would not undergo ring opening theoretical calculations indicated that pre coupling to hs enabled the ring opening oxidation by increasing the nucleophilicity and decreasing ring opening barrier of thiadiazole based on the density function theory dft the global nucleophilicity index nu followed the trend of hs mmtd mmtd dimer sulfonated mmtd while the ring opening barrier followed the trend of hs mmtd 274 kj mol first ring of mmtd dimers 286 kj mol mmtd 338 kj mol theoretical calculations further confirmed that the cross coupled hs mmtd intermediate was more likely to be decyclized than intermediates from direct oxidation moreover nitrogen acetaldehyde group sulfate and co2 were the products of thiadiazole ring degradation pre

environmental problems 2 mecapto 5 methyl 1 3 4 thiadizaole mmtd is an important raw material and metabolic intermediate of most widely used first generation cephalosporins antibiotics cefazolin kariyone et al 1970 and cefazedone sterilizers zinc thiazole and corrosion inhibitors 1 3 4 thiadizaole based thioglycosides vudhgiri et al 2017 cephalosporins took 50 8 of chinese antibacterial drugs market in 2016 including over 500 tons of cefazolin the cspc pharm company leads about 30 of chinese cefazolin market share and daily produces about 100 tons of wastewater during cefazolin production containing about 4 58 mm mmtd table s1 based on this calculation producing every 5 tons of cefazolin would subject 1 ton mmtd to wastewater treatment mmtd enters the environment as residual of antibiotic wastewater treatment as overdosed residual precursor in finished product won et al 1998 and as toxic pharmaceutical metabolite 13 of cefazedone is excreted in the form of mmtd wang and lin 2012 zhang et al 2010 cephalosporins and their metabolites entering the aqueous environment may cause antibiotic resistance genes qin et al 2020 and teratogens beaudoin 1973 in aquatic biological systems furthermore mmtd is hundred times more risk than cefazolin or cefazedone in causing embryo deformities chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2010 therefore the removal of toxic antibiotic metabolites especially mmtd is becoming an urgent issue for wastewater treatment the main structure of mmtd is thiadiazole ring recently the removal of many thiadiazoles by photolysis gurkan et al 2012 liu et al 2009 zerovalent iron shen et al 2015 and ozonation lopez et al 2002 valdes and zaror 2005 valdes et al 2003 has been reported thiadiazole rings are difficult to be broken or mineralized in these advanced oxidation process many accumulative by products gurkan et al 2012 liu et al 2009 lopez et al 2002 valdes and zaror 2005 valdes et al 2003 are detected thiadiazoles subjected to biochemical treatment may inhibit bio degradation due to their sterilizing role in destructing microbial community therefore wastewater containing thiadiazoles may not meet wastewater discharge standers after advanced bio and oxidation treatment for the poor total organic carbon toc removal efficiencies liu et al 2009 residual thiadiazoles with the intact ring in antibiotic wastewater are discharged into the receiving water bodies posing great risk to the environment there are two ways to enhance the ring opening degradation of thiadiazole compounds to develop some advanced catalysts duan et al 2018 nie et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 or to explore the transformation pathways of thiadiazole compounds with the presence of different intermediates mmtd is a special kind of thiadiazole that contains a thiol group thiol groups are easy to be attacked by electrophiles e g quinone or oxidants forming dimers including self coupled s s dimers and cross coupled dimers bialk et al 2005 gulkowska et al 2012 gulkowska et al 2013 kong et al 2013 zhong et al 2019b or sulfonic acid du et al 2018 respectively both coupling and oxidative degradation processes can change the electronic population of organic compounds therefore influence the hydrophilicity gulkowska et al 2013 li et al 2015 zhong et al 2019a degradability freed et al 2008 and toxicity du et al 2017 of these compounds interestingly coupling and oxidative degradation are co existing processes coupling polymerization of phenol olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 aniline tang et al 2010 bisphenol s wang et al 2017 17β estradiol sun et al 2016 yu et al 2020 and sulfamethazine gao et al 2012 was observed in typical advanced oxidation processes including photochemical oxidation persulfate uv hydrogen peroxide uv peroxymonosulfate uv thermo activated oxidation persulfate heat fenton like oxidation zerovalent iron citrate and directly oxidized by mno2 thus oxidative degradation and coupling may be different ways to change the electronic population of organic compounds as coupling may significantly change the electronic population of mmtd pre coupling of mmtd is a possible pathway to promote the ring opening degradation of mmtd however the transformation pathways intermediates and final products of mmtd during oxidation treatment were not yet systematically studied the role of different mmtd intermediates on the further ring opening degradation of thiadiazoles was not clear the aim of this work was to propose a coupling oxidation process that enhance ring opening of mmtd during wastewater treatment in particular the promotion of mmtd ring opening by pre coupling to hs was emphatically studied the removal of mmtd under different oxidizing conditions air atmosphere weak oxidizing conditions ozonation fenton oxidation was explored the role of hs including diphenols phenol aniline benzoic acid in determining the removal kinetics pathways and products during weak oxidation was examined firstly a serial of removal experiments was studied with high performance liquid chromatography hplc to explore how hs influenced the removal of mmtd products and intermediates were identified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry esi tof ms to elucidate the different transformation pathways of mmtd with and without the presence of hs which consequently influenced the final products secondly theoretic calculation based on density functional theory dft was applied to study the transformation including electronic population regioselectivity ring breaking energy nucleophilicity electrophilicity and structural stability of different intermediates and products and schematic transformation pathways of mmtd with and without the presence of hs during coupling and oxidation were proposed accordingly finally the environmental existence hydrophilicity octanol water ratio and reactivity of mmtd with and without hs after coupling oxidation process were compared to reveal the synthetic effect of coupling and oxidative degradation and to demonstrate the significant role of hs in reducing the environmental risk of mmtd as an environmentally friendly and easily separated pre coupling agent pre coupling by hs providing new ideas and strategies for the green and sustainable treatment of antibiotic wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents 2 mercapto 5 methyl 1 3 4

substances denoted as hs were obtained from xilong scientific guangdong china δ mno2 was prepared according to hashemzadeh et al 2009 all other reagents were in analytic grade and were from beijing chemical works beijing china unless stated otherwise deionized water di was generated by a milli q advantage a10 ultrapure water purification system milllipore billerica ma a stock solution of 5 g l humic substances were obtained by dissolving unpurified humic acid with 1 g l koh and filtered to remove humin impurities the solution was then adjusted to ph 6 8 by 0 01 m hcl finally diluted to 5 g l and stored at 4 a stock solution of 7 5 mm mmtd were also stored at 4 for daily use 2 2 removal of mmtd under different oxidizing conditions the removal of mmtd in three different oxidizing systems was studied respectively including in air with the presence of hs in mno2 oxidation with without the presence of 4mcat in ozone and in fenton oxidation the removal efficiencies of low concentrations mmtd with the presence of different model humic substances and real humic substances were studied in a long term reaction model humic substances included 4mcat cat cl hq ba bp bap syr va 4coma ga 2 3bena real humic substances was first dispersed in water ph 6 8 the reaction was operated in a 100 ml conical flask under magnetic stirring 500 rpm at room temperature the solution contained an initial concentration of 1 5 mm mmtd and 1 0 mm different model humic substances with a background electrolyte of 1 0 mm kcl the reaction was operated under unadjusted ph values and ph 8 0 respectively after 2 days the liquor was sampled and immediately tested by hplc uv method note s1 for real humic substances 5 500 mg l the reaction was operated in a 1 l flask under magnetic stirring 500 rpm at room temperature the solution contained initial concentrations of 0 15 15 mm mmtd and 5 500 mg l real humic substances with a background electrolyte of 1 mm kcl at initial ph 6 8 on the 7th day the ph values were adjusted to 8 0 by 0 1 m koh the liquor was daily sampled and analyzed immediately by hplc uv method the organic matter was coagulated on the 14th day by adding 400 mg l pfs fresh flocs were gathered and analyzed by sem and eds note s3 methods flocs were also air dried at 60 for further xps note s4 xrd note s5 and ftir note s6 analyses the removal of low concentrations mmtd by mno2 was studied with and without the presence of 4mcat the reaction was operated in a 100 ml conical flask under magnetic stirring 500 rpm at room temperature the liquor contained an initial concentration of 1 5 mm mmtd and 0 1 g l commercial mno2 with a background electrolyte of 1 mm kcl the initial concentrations of 4mcat was 2 mm the reactions were sampled with a time interval of 40 min and immediately analyzed by hplc uv method note s1 the toc removal and cod removal of mmtd by mno2 with and without the presence of 4mcat was evaluated because 4mcat was also organic compound and would contribute to the toc and cod the toc and cod removal of 4mcat by mno2 was also tested to reduce the system error the initial concentrations of mmtd in this test was 5 mm close to that of real mmtd contaminated wastewater table s2 the initial concentrations of 4mcat was 10 mm 0 1 g l mno2 was added to the mmtd and 4mcat mixture and the toc and cod removal was tested after 2 h reaction these samples were ultra centrifugated to remove mno2 and in situ formed flocs before testing the tests were run in duplicates the transformation and toc removal of high concentration mmtd by ozonation fenton oxidation was studied the reaction was operated in a 500 ml conical flask under magnetic stirring 500 rpm at room temperature for ozonation the o3 was generated from pure oxygen by an ozone generator whose power was 23 1 w the pure oxygen inlet flow was 100 ml min and the out let contained 60 4 ppm o3 for fenton oxidation the initial ph value was adjusted to 3 2 10 0 g l 30 hydrogen peroxide and 5 0 g l feso4 7h2o was added to the system and the reaction was quenched by diluting with 1 0 g l ki before testing the liquor contained an initial concentration of 5 73 mm mmtd whose toc was 200 ppm the reactions were sampled and immediately analyzed by hplc uv note s1 and toc toc vcph analyzer shimadzu japan the tests were run in duplicates 2 3 transformation kinetics and product identification the transformation kinetics of mmtd with the presence of model humic substances were studied the reaction was operated in a 100 ml conical flask under magnetic stirring 500 rpm at room temperature the initial concentrations of mmtd ranged from 0 75 7 5 mm model humic substances ranged from 1 to 5 mm ph values ranged from 4 to 10 background electrolyte ranged from 1 to 10 mm the reactions were sampled with a time interval of 40 min and immediately tested by hplc uv method note s1 the removal kinetics was fitted by a zero order kinetic model based on a mono substitution assumption and steady state assumption note s8 the transformation products of mmtd with the presence of model humic substances and metal oxides were identified by esi tof ms method note s2 after 4 h treatment different model humic substances included 4mcat cat cl hq 2 5clq va syr ga and 2 3bena alkaline conditions different metal oxides included commercial mno2 δ mno2 fe o2 forming in situ fe2o3 shen et al 2015 in some cases more than one model humic substances or metal oxides may be used to treat mmtd the predominated peaks of each sample were further analyzed by ms ms spectrum note s2 2 4 density functional theory method the physical and chemical properties of mmtd coupling products intermediates and reagents were calculated by dft method the structures and frontier molecules orbitals including ehomo elumo etc of these molecules were calculated at a level of b3lyp 6 31 g d on gaussian 16 frisch et al 2016 and the cartesian coordinates of mmtd different polyphenols and their intermediates and final products were given in tables s5 s6 the most nucleophilic f or electrophilic f sites of some reagents and intermediates calculated by the fukui function using hirschfeld charge the fundamental gap hardness gazquez et al 1993 nucleophilicity index based on the ehomo of trichloroethylene luis r domingo 2008 were displayed on multiwfn 3 6 lu and chen 2012 note s7 enthalpy changes gibbs free energy changes were obtained by frequency analysis based on the optimized structure the octanol water ratio kow was obtained by an implicit solvation model based on density eq 1 the cn bond energy was calculated after scanning the cn bond by generating symmetric broken orbital matrix but the ring opened structure was not optimized for its high instability 1 l o g k o w δ g o c t

smd method 3 results 3 1 removal of mmtd with the presence of hs humic substances hs are naturally occurring adsorbent in aquatic environments which have positive effect on the removal of micropollutants by nanofiltration ogutverici et al 2016 coagulation rebhun et al 1998 adsorption ortiz martinez et al 2016 etc and may promote the removal of mmtd under aerobic conditions the removal efficiencies of mmtd with the presence of real hs and different model humic substances model hs is shown in fig 1 the influences of polyphenol structures substituent groups initial concentrations of hs and mmtd and ph values were discussed the removal of mmtd by real hs was related to the ph values and the initial concentrations of real hs at a ratio of mmtd hs 2 5 w w mmtd was hardly removed by real hs at neutral conditions ph 6 8 but largely reduced by 66 9 6 5 7 6 100 μm mmtd with a slight increase in the ph values ph 8 0 fig s1 hs is composed of fulvic acid humic acid participate at ph 2 and humin insoluble which are easy to be separated by changing ph values guimaraes et al 2013 higher ph values indicated better solubility of hs which made little contributions to the adsorption of mmtd to real hs fig s2 at the same mmtd hs ratio the removal of mmtd under alkaline conditions decreased with a rising real hs initial concentration which was 66 9 25 2 and 6 5 with the presence of 5 mg l 50 mg l and 500 mg l real hs respectively the mmtd hs solutions were coagulated by poly ferric sulfate pfs in the mmtd hs flocs the missing peaks in xps s2p and ftir frequency 743 cm 1 spectra and the sem patterns indicated that mmtd was incorporated into real hs by forming c s bonds fig s3 the chemical reactions between hs and mmtd were studied with the help of different model hs transformation of mmtd with the presence of different model hs was studied under unadjusted ph and alkaline ph values the selection of unadjusted ph values was to simulate the real wastewater whose buffering effect was too weak to retain the ph values after adding different model hs the selection of alkaline ph values was to explore how the removal of mmtd was promoted under ph 8 0 with the presence of real hs polyphenols were the most reactive model hs in transforming mmtd the transformation of mmtd by 4mcat cat and cl hq under neutral conditions was up to 95 95 and 98 respectively along with the transformation of mmtd the diphenol structures were oxidized to its quinone form for example colorless 4mcat was oxidized to methyl o quinone brownish which was suspected to be reactive in the transformation of mmtd forming reddish products under alkaline conditions the transformation of mmtd by 4mcat was inhibited to 60 but those by cat or cl hq was not much changed the inhibition was probably a result of the decrease in the redox potential of oxygen under alkaline conditions phenol bp aniline ba and 4 aminophenol bap had little contribution in the transformation of mmtd under neutral conditions the transformation of mmtd by ba bp and bap was 1 9 3 4 and 1 7 respectively the transformation of mmtd by bap was increased to 10 4 under alkaline conditions aromatic acid strongly inhibited the transformation of mmtd under unadjusted ph values ph 2 syr 4coma va ga and 2 3bena could not transform mmtd ga and 2 3bena could transform mmtd by 19 and 6 under alkaline conditions ph 8 0 respectively the removal of mmtd was accompanied by a formation of ga polymers yellowish giannakopoulos et al 2017 moreover the presence of 4mcat also largely promoted the transformation of mmtd by typical metal oxides mno2 after adding 2 mm 4mcat the 4 hour removal of mmtd was increased from 72 4 to 92 4 fig s4 the increased mmtd removal demonstrated a synthetic effect of mno2 and 4mcat on one hand presence of mno2 provided stronger oxidizing conditions than oxygen therefore accelerated the generation of 4mcatq stone and morgan 1984 and promoted the coupling of mmtd to 4mcatq on the other hand presence of 4mcat may result in more products of mmtd with 4mcat during mno2 mediated weak oxidation lu and huang 2009 3 2 removal of mmtd by coupling to 4mcat diphenols were used to study the transformation kinetics of mmtd with the presence of hs due to their high mmtd transformation efficiencies and close properties to real hs jianmei zou 2020 the removal efficiency of mmtd by different diphenols was cl hq 4mcat cat fig 2 because cl hq posed great risk to the environment kalinichenko et al 2017 and because cl hq showed strong absorbance at wavelength 311 nm 4mcat was chosen to study the removal kinetics of mmtd the influences of atmosphere ph values background electrolyte and initial concentrations were considered in this section the concentration of mmtd was denoted as mmtd oxygen played an important role in the removal of mmtd by 4mcat no removal of mmtd was observed under n2 atmosphere with the presence of 4mcat but 4mcat pre oxidized to 4mcatq can transform mmtd under n2 atmosphere indicating mmtd was removed by 4mcatq fig s5 protons and high background electrolyte also inhibited the transformation of mmtd fig s6 high ph values probably inhibited the transformation of mmtd by reducing the redox potential of oxygen interestingly cations had larger effect on the transformation of mmtd than anions did especially monovalent cations although oxygen exhibited higher oxidizing ability under acidic conditions zhong et al 2019a the transformation of mmtd was largely decided by the mmtd speciation scheme 0 instead of the concentrations of quinoid structures note s8 the transformation rate of mmtd r mmtd increased with increasing mmtd or 4mcat initial concentrations fig 3 the transformation of mmtd was zero order but the rate constants of were related to the mmtd initial concentrations when mmtd initial ranged from 75 to 300 μm the removal rate of mmtd is around 5 10 3 mmtd initial min 1 with the presence of 2 mm 4mcat therefore the removal kinetic was atypical zero order reaction pseudo zero order where the rate constant was 0 7 orders proportional to the initial concentrations of 4mcat and 1 order proportional to that of mmtd a kinetic model was built on step by step chemical reactions and steady state assumptions note s9 the presence of model hs not only fully transformed mmtd but also increased the toc and cod removal of mmtd in the oxidation stage a simulated wastewater containing 5 mm mmtd and 5 mm model hs was treated by 0 1 g l mno2 fig s7 where model hs had high contributions to the cod 54 8 and toc 61 1 of the simulated wastewater mno2 efficiently reduced the total toc and cod of the simulated wastewater by 81 0 and 69 6 forming flocs mno2 can only reduce the toc cod values of model hs and mmtd by 19 3 20 5 and 12 8 13 6 respectively adsorption predominated the removal of model hs or mmtd by mno2 therefore with the presence of both model hs and mmtd the sheer drop in toc and cod demonstrated that more transformation pathways were involved in the mmtd model hs mno2 system the transformation mechanism was carefully discussed in this paper 3 3 products and intermediates identification mmtd can form dimers in aerobic solutions fig s8 m z 263 the automatic dimerization of mmtd was inevitable but had little contribution to the mmtd removal fig s5 coupling of mmtd to different model hs and oxidation of mmtd and coupled mmtd was discussed fig 4 a showed the transformation products of mmtd with the presence of 4mcat the peaks at m z 253 383 513 were predominated and represented for mono mmtd substituted 4mcatq di mmtd substituted 4mcatq tri mmtd substituted 4mcatq respectively the maximum substitution number of mmtd on 4mcatq was 3 indicating that these mmtd are directly bound to the quinone ring by substituting h when treated by cat the peaks at m z 239 indicated the incorporation of mmtd to cat structures fig s9 when treated by cl hq the peaks at m z 239 and 369 not only indicated the removal of mmtd but also the dechlorination of the quinone ring fig s9 under alkaline conditions the peak at m z 163 and 179 that represented for oxidized mmtd with sh oxidized to s o 2h and s o 2oh alessio 2004 bibi et al 2015 was found with the presence of ga fig 4 b many other mono mmtd substituted aromatic acids were found under same conditions but were hardly observed for their weak intensity fig s10 mmtd was not transformed under acidic conditions with the presence of ga naturally occurring metal oxides were typically weak oxidants which can further transform mmtd and all its coupled products mass spectra of mmtd transformed by synthesized mno2 jiang jin 2015 commercial mno2 and in situ formed fe2o3 shen et al 2015 were similar only the mmtd dimers were partly transformed by fe2o3 but completely transformed by different mno2 fig s11 in fig 4 c the peaks at m z 97 and 211 predominated when treating mmtd with metal oxides the molecular formula and the structure of the product at 211 were analyzed by a secondary mass spectrum and was found as a result of sulfonation on the mercaptan group of mmtd from sh to s so3h fig s12 the peak at 97 was typical hso4 ion and was probably a result of the decyclization of thiadiazole ring oxidation of mmtd by mno2 occurred in a wide ph range fig s13 during the oxidation coupled mmtd were transformed to sulfonated quinones fig 4 d the coupling of mmtd to 4mcat and oxidation by mno2 was operated separately to obtain more referenceable intermediates the peaks at m z 97 211 and 463 were predominated the former two were the products of residual mmtd after coupling to 4mcat the peak at 463 was a result of decyclization of tri mmtd substituted 4mcatq with one of the thiadiazole ring degraded to sulfonate group weaker peaks at m z 203 and 333 also indicated the degradation of thiadiazole ring mono mmtd substituted 4mcatq and di mmtd substituted 4mcatq were no longer observed interestingly after coupling to 4mcat thiadiazole ring can be decyclized without the presence of metal oxides the peak at m z 333 fig 4 a was a result of thiadiazole decyclization of di mmtd substituted 4mcatq adding metal oxides may just accelerate the oxidation process by providing stronger oxidizing conditions coupling of mmtd was inevitable before its finial oxidation but the products were different with and without the presence of model hs therefore we called that mmtd may be degraded via a coupling oxidation process which was a possible fate of mmtd in the environment 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism of mmtd coupling mmtd was transformed via coupling oxidation process in weak oxidation systems the schematic transformation of mmtd coupling was given in schemes 1 3 notably because quinone q was prone to be reduced to hydroquinone q 2h intermediate that would be rapidly deprotonate to produce q h under esi negative mode wang et al 2016 many cross coupling products m were observed in the form of m h the enthalpy change of each step was calculated by dft method optimization frequency 25 more detailed enthalpy changes were provided in figs s14 and s15 the chemical structures of each product and intermediate were deduced by ms ms spectra fig s12 and condensed electrophilicity fukui function f of the quinones table s2 hs played an important role in coupling mmtd quinoid structures and phenolic structures are the two most important hs structures in the coupling process however different structures may play different role in coupling mmtd quinoid structures can couple many micropollutants via nucleophilic addition gulkowska et al 2012 gulkowska et al 2013 park et al 1999 according to the quantum chemical calculation based on density function theory dft mmtd was more likely to be incorporated into 4mcatq catq via nucleophilic addition under aerobic neutral conditions scheme 2 and into cl q via nucleophilic substitution scheme 3 cl q are easy to be base hydrolyzed to hydroxyquinone oh q zhao et al 2012 which was a possible intermediate during nucleophilic substitution in some cases cl q can go nucleophilic addition du et al 2017 but was only nucleophilically substituted with the presence of mmtd the nucleophilic addition substitution on the quinone ring is typical 1 4 addition which is also called michael addition du et al 2016 proved that michael adducts were relatively stable under alkaline and neutral conditions ph 2 and the nucleophilic substitution was a typical sn2 reaction although low ph values promoted the oxidation of 4mcat cat to its quinoid form ionization inhibited the transformation of mmtd radical coupling was another mmtd coupling pathway when the system is with metal oxides the surface metal valance state was reduced to generate mmtd radicals zhong et al 2019a which were coupled to form mmtd dimers the major intermediates in the coupling stage were quinone and semiquinone radical coupling did not generate reactive oxygen species the dimerization of mmtd by mno2 was accompanied by the reduction of surface mn moieties however in scheme 1 hydroxyl radical was employed to reduce computing time also a small fraction of mmtd radicals was generated with the presence of semiquinone radicals semiquinone radical was generated from model hs contained a di oh substituted or tri oh substituted benzene structure including ga 2 3bena hydrolyzed bap beiginejad et al 2013 etc via autoxidation along with the generation of semiquinone radicals was an observable polymerization of model hs take ga as an example ga generated semiquinone radicals via autoxidation giannakopoulos et al 2005 yoshioka et al 2003 under alkaline conditions with the consequential formation of ga polymers giannakopoulos et al 2017 kamel et al 1977 yellowish and quinones caregnato et al 2008 the autoxidation pathway of quinone and phenolic compounds was given in chemical eq 1 the in situ generated ga radicals were active in transferring electrons and generating reactive oxygen species ros wang and eriksson 2001 including mmtd radicals where the energy barrier for radical reactions the value can be expressed by enthalpy change was almost 0 kcal mol figure s14 scheme 2 mmtd radicals ehomo lumo α 5 30 ev were more stable than ga radicals ehomo lumo α 5 03 ev shouji et al 1996 besides generating mmtd radicals ga radicals may also be further oxidized to ga quinones park et al 1999 or bind to pronated heterocyclic ring here was thiadiazole ring via hydrogen bond soobrattee et al 2005 turek et al 2016 the contribution of ga radicals in coupling mmtd was relatively small but provided a possible explanation for the better removal of mmtd by real hs at higher ph values the as generated mmtd radical can go homo coupling forming dimers scheme 1 or cross coupling with semiquinone radicals forming ga mmtd adducts etc when the system is in presence of non quinoid hs dimerization predominated the radical coupling of mmtd radicals only a small fraction of cross coupled mmtd was observed 2 aroh o h h 2 o ar o o 2 o 2 ar o cross coupling and dimerization were the two dominated mmtd coupling pathways the former one occurred with the presence of quinoid hs via nucleophilic addition substitution while the later one majorly occurred without the presence of model hs via radical coupling the coupling stage involves no reactive oxygen species 4 2 mechanism of mmtd and coupled mmtd further oxidation cross coupled mmtd mmtd dimers and mmtd can be oxidized by mno2 the chemical formula relative intensity and potential transformation pathways of different intermediates during mno2 oxidation were given in table s3 in the oxidation stage different mmtd and its coupling products can be transformed to different products the further oxidation of mmtd and coupled mmtd was shown in schemes 4 and 5 firstly a minor fraction of mmtd can be directly oxidized to sulfonic thiadiazole by the metal oxidants or enzymes here was mno2 scheme 4 alessio 2004 bibi et al 2015 secondly both mmtd self coupling products and cross coupling products can be sequentially oxidized to breakdown the thiadiazole ring but to different final products nitrogen liu et al 2011 acetaldehyde may be further oxidized to acetic acid sulfate and co2 were the products of thiadiazole ring opening degradation and sulfonated mmtd or sulfonated 4mcat remained interestingly there was no strict order between o addition and nitrogen elimination decyclization of thiadiazole ring occurred after adding 1 4 o to mmtd according to the fukui function the non cyclic s denoted as s1 cyclic s was denoted as s2 was the most nucleophilic reactive site to the first o addition table s4 a decyclization pathway of thiadiazole ring was proposed as scheme 5 to begin with serval o was added to coupled mmtd in the second step a cn bond bond energy was around 274 kj mol fig s16 was broken after a proton addition simultaneously the o added to s1 was rearranged to form s2 c o ch3 fig s18 the cn2 structure was highly unstable and would eliminate nitrogen immediately fig s17 liu et al 2011 highly unstable cn2 structure confirmed that cn bond was not broken by o addition otherwise the peaks at m z 269 should not be observed the thiadiazole ring opening followed by nitrogen elimination was thermodynamically feasible δg 0 but may include more than one transition states then after the nitrogen elimination and several more oxygen addition the s2 c o ch3 bond was hydrolyzed to eliminate acetaldehyde the leaving acetaldehyde may be further oxidized to acetic acid or even co2 by mno2 not identified in lc ms for their low molecular weight finally s2 was left in the form of sulfate anions the c between s1 and s2 was not detected in the mass spectra for its low molecular weight formaldehyde formic acid and carbon dioxide were the possible form of the remaining c as the oxidizing condition was provided by mno2 carbon dioxide was the most possible form of c no further oxidization of sulfonated mmtd was observed however two different thiadiazole rings combined to the same 4mcat may simultaneously eliminate nitrogen m z 359 mmtd coupling was inevitable before further oxidized by mno2 according to the dft calculation the cn bond energy in the thiadiazole was decreased by 20 from 338 kj mol to 274 kj mol after coupling to model hs and was decreased by 15 from 338 kj mol to 286 kj mol after dimerization fig s16 however a thiadiazole ring remained in the form of sulfonated mmtd without the presence of model hs therefore the role of model hs in the coupling oxidation should be further discussed 4 3 role of hs in promoting thiadiazole decyclization although some advanced oxidation process e g ozonation fenton oxidation wang et al 2017 can quickly transform mmtd either the toc removal is very poor figs s19 and s20 or the operating cost is high table s7 coupling combined with oxidation technologies can efficiently transform mmtd breakdown the thiadiazole ring fig 4 and remove the toc by 80 9 of the mmtd wastewater fig s7 as coupling was a common transformation pathway of many micropollutants in aquatic environments this work provided a new idea that coupling may also promote the degradation of mmtd during aquatic weak oxidation coupling of mmtd decreased the thiadiazole ring breaking energy which means the decyclization of mmtd was promoted during coupling oxidation in comparison with direct oxidation dimerization and cross coupling were the two coupling pathways of mmtd compared to dimerization cross coupling to model hs would further decrease the ring breaking energy dimerization majorly occurred when the system was in the absence of model hs while cross coupling occurred conversely the reactivity and hydrophilicity of predominated mmtd intermediates and products in different pathways were predicted by dft method and was given in table s2 pre coupling to model hs avoided the formation of two difficult to oxidize intermediates mmtd dimers and sulfonated mmtd higher ehomo lumo and hardness indicated that an organic molecule is less reactive as was shown in table 1 the ehomo lumo of mmtd 4mcatq mmtd catq and mmtd quinone was 3 06 ev 3 10 ev 3 23 ev respectively all to be far lower than that of mmtd dimer 4 65 ev and sulfonated mmtd 4 91 ev higher nucleophilicity index indicated that the organic molecule is more likely to lose electrons and to be oxidized the nucleophilicity index of mmtd 4mcatq mmtd catq and mmtd quinone was 2 48 ev 2 37 ev 2 14 ev respectively which was higher than that of mmtd dimers 1 89 ev and sulfonated mmtd 1 39 ev this result also explained why no further oxidation of sulfonated mmtd was observed sulfonated mmtd kow 2 45 10 4 was neither easy to be further oxidized nor to be precipitated for its increased hydrophilicity compared to mmtd kow 2 54 although sulfonated mmtd was not likely to across cell membrane the thiadiazole ring it contained may pose other risk to the environment conversely hs pre coupled with mmtd may be returned to nature in forms of sulfonated hs which was much more environmentally friendly hs took part in the transformation of mmtd as a good radical generator good electron transfer intermediate and possible substrate pre coupling to model hs not only further decreased the thiadiazole ring breaking energy but also avoided the formation of difficult to oxidize and difficult to precipitate sulfonated mmtd which was preferred coupling pathways than dimerization fig 5 moreover the apparent transformation rate of mmtd by mno2 was much increased with the presence of model hs the presence and absence of hs largely affected the transformation rate pathways and products distribution by directly determining the coupling pathways of mmtd using real hs to couple mmtd can reduce the costs and simplify the separation process in developing coupling oxidation technologies however real hs in this work cannot efficiently remove mmtd for its low quinoid percentage the real hs applied in this work majorly coupled mmtd by generating semiquinone radicals chen et al 2010 see section 4 1 adding too many real hs may not only scavenge oxygen cristale et al 2017 and active site of mno2 li and hu 2016 but also quench many other reactive oxygen species bokare and choi 2015 coelho et al 2011 porras et al 2014 nowadays both natural hs and synthetic hs are available zou et al jianmei zou 2020 found that catechin can be polymerized to form hs with the presence of amino acid which is a possible way to produce hs with high quinoid percentage we believed that using synthetic hs with high quinoid percentage may reduce the costs and avoid the dimerization of mmtd at the same time in developing coupling oxidation technologies moreover compared to advanced oxidation processes coupling oxidation not only increased the toc removal and reduced the operating cost but also increased the selectivity of mmtd transformation dissolved organic solvents would not be transformed during coupling oxidation therefore subjecting easy to degrade organic solvents to bio degradation may also reduce the operating cost of complicated wastewater matrix 5 conclusion mmtd entering environment as pharmaceutical intermediate and metabolite of cefazolin and cefazedone is hundred times riskier than the antibiotics themselves however the transformation and final products of mmtd during wastewater treatment was not paid enough attention to our research found that mmtd can be efficiently transformed under weak oxidation conditions pre coupled to humic substances and further oxidized by metal oxides was a possible transformation pathway of mmtd which was named as a two step coupling oxidation process 1 mmtd can be removed with the presence of model hs or mno2 the coupling rate of mmtd was largely related to the presence of model hs mmtd initial concentration and the presence of protons metal cations mmtd was hardly transformed in air quinoid can efficiently cross couple mmtd 95 via nucleophilic substitution addition while phenolic structures cannot 20 when mmtd initial ranged from 75 to 300 μm the transformation rate of mmtd is around 5 10 3 mmtd initial min 1 with the presence of 2 mm 4mcat which followed zero order transformation kinetics the coupling of mmtd to humic substances would be inhibited by protons and metal cations via ionization moreover the presence of 4mcat increased the 4 hour removal of mmtd by mno2 from 72 4 to 92 4 which also changed the coupling pathways and final products the presence of 4mcat also increased the 2 hour toc removal of high concentrated mmtd by mno2 which was from 12 8 to 80 9 2 according to the esi tof ms and enthalpy change mmtd was cross coupled to quinoid via nucleophilic addition substitution and to semiquinone radicals via radical coupling under alkaline conditions with the presence of metal oxides mmtd was majorly dimerized to mmtd dimers intermediate via radical coupling a minor fraction of thiol group in mmtd would be directly oxidized to sulfonic acid and remained in the system both dimerized mmtd and model hs pre coupled mmtd would be further oxidized with the presence of mno2 mmtd dimers were oxidized to sulfonated mmtd while hs pre coupled mmtd were oxidized to sulfonated hs 3 cross coupling to model hs ehomo lumo 3 06 3 23 ev avoided the formation of two difficult to oxidized intermediates mmtd dimers ehomo lumo 4 65 ev and sulfonated mmtd ehomo lumo 4 91 ev compared to mmtd dimers nu 1 89 ev quinone coupled mmtd nu 2 14 2 48 ev were more reactive in the oxidation stage moreover no further oxidation of sulfonated mmtd was observed the thiadiazole ring contained in sulfonated mmtd may pose risk to the environment while no thiadiazole ring remained when coupled hs returned to nature in forms of sulfonated hs 4 thiadiazole ring in the coupled products was decyclized during the further oxidation after adding an o to the non cyclic s the thiadiazole ring was opened by a proton attack on α carbon with the γ carbon n bond broken at cn bond cleavage was the rearrangement of o to γ carbon and elimination of nitrogen on α carbon right after nitrogen elimination hydrolyzation occurred on α carbon to eliminate the proton and the s c o ch3 bond was hydrolyzed to acetaldehyde h c o ch3 and s oh which would be further oxidized to sulfonic acid group finally the carbon and cyclic s were released in the forms of carbon dioxide and sulfate ring atoms left the thiadiazole ring in the order of nitrogen acetaldehyde group sulfate carbon dioxide only the non cyclic s remained in the coupled products in fact pre coupling enabled the further decyclization of thiadiazole by decreasing the ring breaking energy 338 kj mol where coupled to 4mcat decreased the energy by 20 274 kj mol and dimerization decreased the energy by 15 286 kj mol thiadiazole decyclization indicated fully degradation of mmtd which was not achieved in ozonation as thiadiazole poses potential risk to the environment breaking the thiadiazole ring ensured that mmtd is no longer a threat the aim of wastewater treatment is to reproduce some natural degradation or separation processes of pollutants in a relatively short period kim et al 2007 due to the low toc removal of mmtd in some advanced oxidation process e g ozonation coupling oxidation is a promising process in efficiently transform mmtd at low energy cost and can be used to develop novel green technologies in treating pharmaceutical wastewater humic substances is an important reagent in developing coupling oxidation technologies although adding dissolved humic acid may increase the chemical oxidation demand cod and total organic carbon toc of pharmaceutical wastewater coupling to humic acid actually accelerated the degradation and further decreased the environmental risk of the emerging pollutants during weak oxidation moreover the transformed hs can be removed via coagulation which was a common step of current pharmaceutical wastewater treatment processes author contributions the manuscript

17551,as an important raw material and intermediate of widely used antibiotics cefazolin and cefazedone 2 mecapto 5 methyl 1 3 4 thiadizaole mmtd in antibiotic wastewater is hardly decyclized during wastewater treatment posing great risk to the environment this work proposed a green coupling oxidation process to enhance ring opening of mmtd during antibiotic wastewater treatment in particular the significant role of humic substances hs as pre coupling reagent was emphasized real hs and different model hs especially quinones not only efficiently pre coupled mmtd 95 but also promoted the mmtd removal by mno2 from 72 4 to 92 4 mass spectrometric analysis indicated that mmtd pre coupled to hs would be oxidized with ring opening to environmental friendly sulfonated hs while direct oxidation of mmtd produced mmtd dimers or sulfonated mmtd that would not undergo ring opening theoretical calculations indicated that pre coupling to hs enabled the ring opening oxidation by increasing the nucleophilicity and decreasing ring opening barrier of thiadiazole based on the density function theory dft the global nucleophilicity index nu followed the trend of hs mmtd mmtd dimer sulfonated mmtd while the ring opening barrier followed the trend of hs mmtd 274 kj mol first ring of mmtd dimers 286 kj mol mmtd 338 kj mol theoretical calculations further confirmed that the cross coupled hs mmtd intermediate was more likely to be decyclized than intermediates from direct oxidation moreover nitrogen acetaldehyde group sulfate and co2 were the products of thiadiazole ring degradation pre

environmental problems 2 mecapto 5 methyl 1 3 4 thiadizaole mmtd is an important raw material and metabolic intermediate of most widely used first generation cephalosporins antibiotics cefazolin kariyone et al 1970 and cefazedone sterilizers zinc thiazole and corrosion inhibitors 1 3 4 thiadizaole based thioglycosides vudhgiri et al 2017 cephalosporins took 50 8 of chinese antibacterial drugs market in 2016 including over 500 tons of cefazolin the cspc pharm company leads about 30 of chinese cefazolin market share and daily produces about 100 tons of wastewater during cefazolin production containing about 4 58 mm mmtd table s1 based on this calculation producing every 5 tons of cefazolin would subject 1 ton mmtd to wastewater treatment mmtd enters the environment as residual of antibiotic wastewater treatment as overdosed residual precursor in finished product won et al 1998 and as toxic pharmaceutical metabolite 13 of cefazedone is excreted in the form of mmtd wang and lin 2012 zhang et al 2010 cephalosporins and their metabolites entering the aqueous environment may cause antibiotic resistance genes qin et al 2020 and teratogens beaudoin 1973 in aquatic biological systems furthermore mmtd is hundred times more risk than cefazolin or cefazedone in causing embryo deformities chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2010 therefore the removal of toxic antibiotic metabolites especially mmtd is becoming an urgent issue for wastewater treatment the main structure of mmtd is thiadiazole ring recently the removal of many thiadiazoles by photolysis gurkan et al 2012 liu et al 2009 zerovalent iron shen et al 2015 and ozonation lopez et al 2002 valdes and zaror 2005 valdes et al 2003 has been reported thiadiazole rings are difficult to be broken or mineralized in these advanced oxidation process many accumulative by products gurkan et al 2012 liu et al 2009 lopez et al 2002 valdes and zaror 2005 valdes et al 2003 are detected thiadiazoles subjected to biochemical treatment may inhibit bio degradation due to their sterilizing role in destructing microbial community therefore wastewater containing thiadiazoles may not meet wastewater discharge standers after advanced bio and oxidation treatment for the poor total organic carbon toc removal efficiencies liu et al 2009 residual thiadiazoles with the intact ring in antibiotic wastewater are discharged into the receiving water bodies posing great risk to the environment there are two ways to enhance the ring opening degradation of thiadiazole compounds to develop some advanced catalysts duan et al 2018 nie et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 or to explore the transformation pathways of thiadiazole compounds with the presence of different intermediates mmtd is a special kind of thiadiazole that contains a thiol group thiol groups are easy to be attacked by electrophiles e g quinone or oxidants forming dimers including self coupled s s dimers and cross coupled dimers bialk et al 2005 gulkowska et al 2012 gulkowska et al 2013 kong et al 2013 zhong et al 2019b or sulfonic acid du et al 2018 respectively both coupling and oxidative degradation processes can change the electronic population of organic compounds therefore influence the hydrophilicity gulkowska et al 2013 li et al 2015 zhong et al 2019a degradability freed et al 2008 and toxicity du et al 2017 of these compounds interestingly coupling and oxidative degradation are co existing processes coupling polymerization of phenol olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 aniline tang et al 2010 bisphenol s wang et al 2017 17β estradiol sun et al 2016 yu et al 2020 and sulfamethazine gao et al 2012 was observed in typical advanced oxidation processes including photochemical oxidation persulfate uv hydrogen peroxide uv peroxymonosulfate uv thermo activated oxidation persulfate heat fenton like oxidation zerovalent iron citrate and directly oxidized by mno2 thus oxidative degradation and coupling may be different ways to change the electronic population of organic compounds as coupling may significantly change the electronic population of mmtd pre coupling of mmtd is a possible pathway to promote the ring opening degradation of mmtd however the transformation pathways intermediates and final products of mmtd during oxidation treatment were not yet systematically studied the role of different mmtd intermediates on the further ring opening degradation of thiadiazoles was not clear the aim of this work was to propose a coupling oxidation process that enhance ring opening of mmtd during wastewater treatment in particular the promotion of mmtd ring opening by pre coupling to hs was emphatically studied the removal of mmtd under different oxidizing conditions air atmosphere weak oxidizing conditions ozonation fenton oxidation was explored the role of hs including diphenols phenol aniline benzoic acid in determining the removal kinetics pathways and products during weak oxidation was examined firstly a serial of removal experiments was studied with high performance liquid chromatography hplc to explore how hs influenced the removal of mmtd products and intermediates were identified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry esi tof ms to elucidate the different transformation pathways of mmtd with and without the presence of hs which consequently influenced the final products secondly theoretic calculation based on density functional theory dft was applied to study the transformation including electronic population regioselectivity ring breaking energy nucleophilicity electrophilicity and structural stability of different intermediates and products and schematic transformation pathways of mmtd with and without the presence of hs during coupling and oxidation were proposed accordingly finally the environmental existence hydrophilicity octanol water ratio and reactivity of mmtd with and without hs after coupling oxidation process were compared to reveal the synthetic effect of coupling and oxidative degradation and to demonstrate the significant role of hs in reducing the environmental risk of mmtd as an environmentally friendly and easily separated pre coupling agent pre coupling by hs providing new ideas and strategies for the green and sustainable treatment of antibiotic wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents 2 mercapto 5 methyl 1 3 4

l and stored at 4 a stock solution of 7 5 mm mmtd were also stored at 4 for daily use 2 2 removal of mmtd under different oxidizing conditions the removal of mmtd in three different oxidizing systems was studied respectively including in air with the presence of hs in mno2 oxidation with without the presence of 4mcat in ozone and in fenton oxidation the removal efficiencies of low concentrations mmtd with the presence of different model humic substances and real humic substances were studied in a long term reaction model humic substances included 4mcat cat cl hq ba bp bap syr va 4coma ga 2 3bena real humic substances was first dispersed in water ph 6 8 the reaction was operated in a 100 ml conical flask under magnetic stirring 500 rpm at room temperature the solution contained an initial concentration of 1 5 mm mmtd and 1 0 mm different model humic substances with a background electrolyte of 1 0 mm kcl the reaction was operated under unadjusted ph values and ph 8 0

fresh flocs were gathered and analyzed by sem and eds note s3 methods flocs were also air dried at 60 for further xps note s4 xrd note s5 and ftir note s6 analyses the removal of low concentrations mmtd by mno2 was studied with and without the presence of 4mcat the reaction was operated in a 100 ml conical flask under magnetic stirring 500 rpm at room temperature the liquor contained an initial concentration of 1 5 mm mmtd and 0 1 g l commercial mno2 with a background electrolyte of 1 mm kcl the initial concentrations of 4mcat was 2 mm the reactions were sampled with a time interval of 40 min and immediately analyzed by hplc uv method note s1 the toc removal and cod removal of mmtd by mno2 with and without the presence of 4mcat was evaluated because 4mcat was also organic compound and would contribute to the toc and cod the toc and cod removal of 4mcat by mno2 was also tested to reduce the system error the initial concentrations of mmtd in this test was 5 mm close to that of real mmtd contaminated wastewater table s2 the initial concentrations of 4mcat was 10 mm 0 1 g l mno2 was added to the mmtd and 4mcat mixture and the toc and cod removal was tested after 2 h reaction these samples were ultra centrifugated to remove mno2 and in situ formed flocs before testing the tests were run in duplicates the transformation and toc removal of high concentration mmtd by ozonation fenton oxidation was studied the reaction was operated in a 500 ml conical flask under magnetic stirring 500 rpm at room temperature for ozonation the o3 was generated from pure oxygen by an ozone generator whose power was 23 1 w the pure oxygen inlet flow was 100 ml min and the out let contained 60 4 ppm o3 for fenton oxidation the initial ph value was adjusted to 3 2 10 0 g l 30 hydrogen peroxide and 5 0 g l feso4 7h2o was added to the system and the reaction was quenched by diluting with 1 0 g l ki before testing the liquor contained an initial concentration of 5 73 mm mmtd whose toc was 200 ppm the reactions were sampled and immediately analyzed by hplc uv note s1 and toc toc vcph analyzer shimadzu japan the tests were run in duplicates 2 3 transformation kinetics and product identification the transformation kinetics of mmtd with the presence of model humic substances were studied the reaction was operated in a 100 ml conical flask under magnetic stirring 500 rpm at room temperature the initial concentrations of mmtd ranged from 0 75 7 5 mm model humic substances ranged from 1 to 5 mm ph values ranged from 4 to 10 background electrolyte ranged from 1 to 10 mm the reactions were sampled with a time interval of 40 min and immediately tested by hplc uv method note s1 the removal kinetics was fitted by a zero order kinetic model based on a mono substitution assumption and steady state assumption note s8 the transformation products of mmtd with the presence of model humic substances and metal oxides were identified by esi tof ms method note s2 after 4 h treatment different model humic substances included 4mcat cat cl hq 2 5clq va syr ga and 2 3bena alkaline conditions different metal oxides included commercial mno2 δ mno2 fe o2 forming in situ fe2o3 shen et al 2015 in some cases more than one model humic substances or metal oxides may be used to treat mmtd the predominated peaks of each sample were further analyzed by ms ms spectrum note s2 2 4 density functional theory method the physical and chemical properties of mmtd coupling products intermediates and reagents were calculated by dft method the structures and frontier molecules orbitals including ehomo elumo etc of these molecules were calculated at a level of b3lyp 6 31 g d on gaussian 16 frisch et al 2016 and the cartesian coordinates of mmtd different polyphenols and their intermediates and final products were given in tables s5 s6 the most nucleophilic f or electrophilic f sites of some reagents and intermediates calculated by the fukui function using hirschfeld charge

smd method 3 results 3 1 removal of mmtd with the presence of hs humic substances hs are naturally occurring adsorbent in aquatic environments which have positive effect on the removal of micropollutants by nanofiltration ogutverici et al 2016 coagulation rebhun et al 1998 adsorption ortiz martinez et al 2016 etc and may promote the removal of mmtd under aerobic conditions the removal efficiencies of mmtd with the presence of real hs and different model humic substances model hs is shown in fig 1 the influences of polyphenol structures substituent groups initial concentrations of hs and mmtd and ph values were discussed the removal of mmtd by real hs was related to the ph values and the initial concentrations of real hs at a ratio of mmtd hs 2 5 w w mmtd was hardly removed by real hs at neutral conditions ph 6 8 but largely reduced by 66 9 6 5 7 6 100 μm mmtd with a slight increase in the ph values ph 8 0 fig s1 hs is composed of fulvic acid humic acid participate at ph 2 and humin insoluble which are easy to be separated by changing ph values guimaraes et al 2013 higher ph values indicated better solubility of hs which made little contributions to the adsorption of mmtd to real hs fig s2 at the same mmtd hs ratio the removal of mmtd under alkaline conditions decreased with a rising real hs initial concentration which was 66 9 25 2 and 6 5 with the presence of 5 mg l 50 mg l and 500 mg l real hs respectively the mmtd hs solutions were coagulated by poly ferric sulfate pfs in the mmtd hs flocs the missing peaks in xps s2p and ftir frequency 743 cm 1 spectra and the sem patterns indicated that mmtd was incorporated into real hs by forming c s bonds fig s3 the chemical reactions between hs and mmtd were studied with the help of different model hs transformation of mmtd with the presence of different model hs was studied under unadjusted ph and alkaline ph values the selection of unadjusted ph values was to simulate the real wastewater whose buffering effect was too weak to retain the ph values after adding different model hs the selection of alkaline ph values was to explore how the removal of mmtd was promoted under ph 8 0 with the presence of real hs polyphenols were the most reactive model hs in transforming mmtd the transformation of mmtd by 4mcat cat and cl hq under neutral conditions was up to 95 95 and 98 respectively along with the transformation of mmtd the diphenol structures were oxidized to its quinone form for example colorless 4mcat was oxidized to methyl o quinone brownish which was suspected to be reactive in the transformation of mmtd forming reddish products under alkaline conditions the transformation of mmtd by 4mcat was inhibited to 60 but those by cat or cl hq was not much changed the inhibition was probably a result of the decrease in the redox potential of oxygen under alkaline conditions phenol bp aniline ba and 4 aminophenol bap had little contribution in the transformation of mmtd under neutral conditions the transformation of mmtd by ba bp and bap was 1 9 3 4 and 1 7 respectively the transformation of mmtd by bap was increased to 10 4 under alkaline conditions aromatic acid strongly inhibited the transformation of mmtd under unadjusted ph values ph 2 syr 4coma va ga and 2 3bena could not transform mmtd ga and 2 3bena could transform mmtd by 19 and 6 under alkaline conditions ph 8 0 respectively the removal of mmtd was accompanied by a formation of ga polymers yellowish giannakopoulos et al 2017 moreover the presence of 4mcat also largely promoted the transformation of mmtd by typical metal oxides mno2 after adding 2 mm 4mcat the 4 hour removal of mmtd was increased from 72 4 to 92 4 fig s4 the increased mmtd removal demonstrated a synthetic effect of mno2 and 4mcat on one hand presence of mno2 provided stronger oxidizing conditions than oxygen therefore accelerated the generation of 4mcatq stone and morgan 1984 and promoted the coupling of mmtd to 4mcatq on the other hand presence of 4mcat may result in more products of mmtd with 4mcat during mno2 mediated weak oxidation lu and huang 2009 3 2 removal of mmtd by coupling to 4mcat diphenols were used to study the transformation kinetics of mmtd with the presence of hs due to their high mmtd transformation efficiencies and close properties to real hs jianmei zou 2020 the removal efficiency of mmtd by different diphenols was cl hq 4mcat cat fig 2 because cl hq posed great risk to the environment kalinichenko et al 2017 and because cl hq showed strong absorbance at wavelength 311 nm 4mcat was chosen to study the removal kinetics of mmtd the influences of atmosphere ph values background electrolyte and initial concentrations were considered in this section the concentration of mmtd was denoted as mmtd oxygen played an important role in the removal of mmtd by 4mcat no removal of mmtd was observed under n2 atmosphere with the presence of 4mcat but 4mcat pre oxidized to 4mcatq can transform mmtd under n2 atmosphere indicating mmtd was removed by 4mcatq fig s5 protons and high background electrolyte also inhibited the transformation of mmtd fig s6 high ph values probably inhibited the transformation of mmtd by reducing the redox potential of oxygen interestingly cations had larger effect on the transformation of mmtd than anions did especially monovalent cations although oxygen exhibited higher oxidizing ability under acidic conditions zhong et al 2019a the transformation of mmtd was largely decided by the mmtd speciation scheme 0 instead of the concentrations of quinoid structures note s8 the transformation rate of mmtd r mmtd increased with increasing mmtd or 4mcat initial concentrations fig 3 the transformation of mmtd was zero order but the rate constants of were related to the mmtd initial concentrations when mmtd initial ranged from 75 to 300 μm the removal rate of mmtd is around 5 10 3 mmtd initial min 1 with the presence of 2 mm 4mcat therefore the removal kinetic was atypical zero order reaction pseudo zero order where the rate constant was 0 7 orders proportional to the initial concentrations of 4mcat and 1 order proportional to that of mmtd a kinetic model was built on step by step chemical reactions and steady state assumptions note s9 the presence of model hs not only fully transformed mmtd but also increased the toc and cod removal of mmtd in the oxidation stage a simulated wastewater containing 5 mm mmtd and 5 mm model hs was treated by 0 1 g l mno2 fig s7 where model hs had high contributions to the cod 54 8 and toc 61 1 of the simulated wastewater mno2 efficiently reduced the total toc and cod of the simulated wastewater by 81 0 and 69 6 forming flocs mno2 can only reduce the toc cod values of model hs and mmtd by 19 3 20 5 and 12 8 13 6 respectively adsorption predominated the removal of model hs or mmtd by mno2 therefore with the presence of both model hs and mmtd the sheer drop in toc and cod demonstrated that more transformation pathways were involved in the mmtd model hs mno2 system the transformation mechanism was carefully discussed in this paper 3 3 products and intermediates identification mmtd can form dimers in aerobic solutions fig s8 m z 263 the automatic dimerization of mmtd was inevitable but had little contribution to the mmtd removal fig s5 coupling of mmtd to different model hs and oxidation of mmtd and coupled mmtd was discussed fig 4 a showed the transformation products of mmtd with the presence of 4mcat the peaks at m z 253 383 513 were predominated and represented for mono mmtd substituted 4mcatq di mmtd substituted 4mcatq tri mmtd substituted 4mcatq respectively the maximum substitution number of mmtd on 4mcatq was 3 indicating that these mmtd are directly bound to the quinone ring by substituting h when treated by cat the peaks at m z 239 indicated the incorporation of mmtd to cat structures fig s9 when treated by cl hq the peaks at m z 239 and 369 not only indicated the removal of mmtd but also the dechlorination of the quinone ring fig s9 under alkaline conditions the peak at m z 163 and 179 that represented for oxidized mmtd with sh oxidized to s o 2h and s o 2oh alessio 2004 bibi et al 2015 was found with the presence of ga fig 4 b many other mono mmtd substituted aromatic acids were found under same conditions but were hardly observed for their weak intensity fig s10 mmtd was not transformed under acidic conditions with the presence of ga naturally occurring metal oxides were typically weak oxidants which can further transform mmtd and all its coupled products mass spectra of mmtd transformed by synthesized mno2 jiang jin 2015 commercial mno2 and in situ formed fe2o3 shen et al 2015 were similar only the mmtd dimers were partly transformed by fe2o3 but completely transformed by different mno2 fig s11 in fig 4 c the peaks at m z 97 and 211 predominated when treating mmtd with metal oxides the molecular formula and the structure of the product at 211 were analyzed by a secondary mass spectrum and was found as a result of sulfonation on the mercaptan group of mmtd from sh to s so3h fig s12 the peak at 97 was typical hso4 ion and was probably a result of the decyclization of thiadiazole ring oxidation of mmtd by mno2 occurred in a wide ph range fig s13 during the oxidation coupled mmtd were transformed to sulfonated quinones fig 4 d the coupling of mmtd to 4mcat and oxidation by mno2 was operated separately to obtain more referenceable intermediates the peaks at m z 97 211 and 463 were predominated the former two were the products of residual mmtd after coupling to 4mcat the peak at 463 was a result of decyclization of tri mmtd substituted 4mcatq with one of the thiadiazole ring degraded to sulfonate group weaker peaks at m z 203 and 333 also indicated the degradation of thiadiazole ring mono mmtd substituted 4mcatq and di mmtd substituted 4mcatq were no longer observed interestingly after coupling to 4mcat thiadiazole ring can be decyclized without the presence of metal oxides the peak at m z 333 fig 4 a was a result of thiadiazole decyclization of di mmtd substituted 4mcatq adding metal oxides may just accelerate the oxidation process by providing stronger oxidizing conditions coupling of mmtd was inevitable before its finial oxidation but the products were different with and without the presence of model hs therefore we called that mmtd may be degraded via a coupling oxidation process which was a possible fate of mmtd in the environment 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism of mmtd coupling mmtd was transformed via coupling oxidation process in weak oxidation systems the schematic transformation of mmtd coupling was given in schemes 1 3 notably because quinone q was prone to be reduced to hydroquinone q 2h intermediate that would be rapidly deprotonate to produce q h under esi negative mode wang et al 2016 many cross coupling products m were observed in the form of m h the enthalpy change of each step was calculated by dft method optimization frequency 25 more detailed enthalpy changes were provided in figs s14 and s15 the chemical structures of each product and intermediate were deduced by ms ms spectra fig s12 and condensed electrophilicity fukui function f of the quinones table s2 hs played an important role in coupling mmtd quinoid structures and phenolic structures are the two most important hs structures in the coupling process however different structures may play different role in coupling mmtd quinoid structures can couple many micropollutants via nucleophilic addition gulkowska et al 2012 gulkowska et al 2013 park et al 1999 according to the quantum chemical calculation based on density function theory dft mmtd was more likely to be incorporated into 4mcatq catq via nucleophilic addition under aerobic neutral conditions scheme 2 and into cl q via nucleophilic substitution scheme 3 cl q are easy to be base hydrolyzed to hydroxyquinone oh q zhao et al 2012 which was a possible intermediate during nucleophilic substitution in some cases cl q can go nucleophilic addition du et al 2017 but was only nucleophilically substituted with the presence of mmtd the nucleophilic addition substitution on the quinone ring is typical 1 4 addition which is also called michael addition du et al 2016 proved that michael adducts were relatively stable under alkaline and neutral conditions ph 2 and the nucleophilic substitution was a typical sn2 reaction although low ph values promoted the oxidation of 4mcat cat to its quinoid form ionization inhibited the transformation of mmtd radical coupling was another mmtd coupling pathway when the system is with metal oxides the surface metal valance state was reduced to generate mmtd radicals zhong et al 2019a which were coupled to form mmtd dimers the major intermediates in the coupling stage were quinone and semiquinone radical coupling did not generate reactive oxygen species the dimerization of mmtd by mno2 was accompanied by the reduction of surface mn moieties however in scheme 1 hydroxyl radical was employed to reduce computing time also a small fraction of mmtd radicals was generated with the presence of semiquinone radicals semiquinone radical was generated from model hs contained a di oh substituted or tri oh substituted benzene structure including ga 2 3bena hydrolyzed bap beiginejad et al 2013 etc via autoxidation along with the generation of semiquinone radicals was an observable polymerization of model hs take ga as an example ga generated semiquinone radicals via autoxidation giannakopoulos et al 2005 yoshioka et al 2003 under alkaline conditions with the consequential formation of ga polymers giannakopoulos et al 2017 kamel et al 1977 yellowish and quinones caregnato et al 2008 the autoxidation pathway of quinone and phenolic compounds was given in chemical eq 1 the in situ generated ga radicals were active in transferring electrons and generating reactive oxygen species ros wang and eriksson 2001 including mmtd radicals where the energy barrier for radical reactions the value can be expressed by enthalpy change was almost 0 kcal mol figure s14 scheme 2 mmtd radicals ehomo lumo α 5 30 ev were more stable than ga radicals ehomo lumo α 5 03 ev shouji et al 1996 besides generating mmtd radicals ga radicals may also be further oxidized to ga quinones park et al 1999 or bind to pronated heterocyclic ring here was thiadiazole ring via hydrogen bond soobrattee et al 2005 turek et al 2016 the contribution of ga radicals in coupling mmtd was relatively small but provided a possible explanation for the better removal of mmtd by real hs at higher ph values the as generated mmtd radical can go homo coupling forming dimers scheme 1 or cross coupling with semiquinone radicals forming ga mmtd adducts etc when the system is in presence of non quinoid hs dimerization predominated the radical coupling of mmtd radicals only a small fraction of cross coupled mmtd was observed 2 aroh o h h 2 o ar o o 2 o 2 ar o cross coupling and dimerization were the two dominated mmtd coupling pathways the former one occurred with the presence of quinoid hs via nucleophilic addition substitution while the later one majorly occurred without the presence of model hs via radical coupling the coupling stage involves no reactive oxygen species 4 2 mechanism of mmtd and coupled mmtd further oxidation cross coupled mmtd mmtd dimers and mmtd can be oxidized by mno2 the chemical formula relative intensity and potential transformation pathways of different intermediates during mno2 oxidation were given in table s3 in the oxidation stage different mmtd and its coupling products can be transformed to different products the further oxidation of mmtd and coupled mmtd was shown in schemes 4 and 5 firstly a minor fraction of mmtd can be directly oxidized to sulfonic thiadiazole by the metal oxidants or enzymes here was mno2 scheme 4 alessio 2004 bibi et al 2015 secondly both mmtd self coupling products and cross coupling products can be sequentially oxidized to breakdown the thiadiazole ring but to different final products nitrogen liu et al 2011 acetaldehyde may be further oxidized to acetic acid sulfate and co2 were the products of thiadiazole ring opening degradation and sulfonated mmtd or sulfonated 4mcat remained interestingly there was no strict order between o addition and nitrogen elimination decyclization of thiadiazole ring occurred after adding 1 4 o to mmtd according to the fukui function the non cyclic s denoted as s1 cyclic s was denoted as s2 was the most nucleophilic reactive site to the first o addition table s4 a decyclization pathway of thiadiazole ring was proposed as scheme 5 to begin with serval o was added to coupled mmtd in the second step a cn bond bond energy was around 274 kj mol fig s16 was broken after a proton addition simultaneously the o added to s1 was rearranged to form s2 c o ch3 fig s18 the cn2 structure was highly unstable and would eliminate nitrogen immediately fig s17 liu et al 2011 highly unstable cn2 structure confirmed that cn bond was not broken by o addition otherwise the peaks at m z 269 should not be observed the thiadiazole ring opening followed by nitrogen elimination was thermodynamically feasible δg 0 but may include more than one transition states then after the nitrogen elimination and several more oxygen addition the s2 c o ch3 bond was hydrolyzed to eliminate acetaldehyde the leaving acetaldehyde may be further oxidized to acetic acid or even co2 by mno2 not identified in lc ms for their low molecular weight finally s2 was left in the form of sulfate anions the c between s1 and s2 was not detected in the mass spectra for its low molecular weight formaldehyde formic acid and carbon dioxide were the possible form of the remaining c as the oxidizing condition was provided by mno2 carbon dioxide was the most possible form of c no further oxidization of sulfonated mmtd was observed however two different thiadiazole rings combined to the same 4mcat may simultaneously eliminate nitrogen m z 359 mmtd coupling was inevitable before further oxidized by mno2 according to the dft calculation the cn bond energy in the thiadiazole was decreased by 20 from 338 kj mol to 274 kj mol after coupling to model hs and was decreased by 15 from 338 kj mol to 286 kj mol after dimerization fig s16 however a thiadiazole ring remained in the form of sulfonated mmtd without the presence of model hs therefore the role of model hs in the coupling oxidation should be further discussed 4 3 role of hs in promoting thiadiazole decyclization although some advanced oxidation process e g ozonation fenton oxidation wang et al 2017 can quickly transform mmtd either the toc removal is very poor figs s19 and s20 or the operating cost is high table s7 coupling combined with oxidation technologies can efficiently transform mmtd breakdown the thiadiazole ring fig 4 and remove the toc by 80 9 of the mmtd wastewater fig s7 as coupling was a common transformation pathway of many micropollutants in aquatic environments this work provided a new idea that coupling may also promote the degradation of mmtd during aquatic weak oxidation coupling of mmtd decreased the thiadiazole ring breaking energy which means the decyclization of mmtd was promoted during coupling oxidation in comparison with direct oxidation dimerization and cross coupling were the two coupling pathways of mmtd compared to dimerization cross coupling to model hs would further decrease the ring breaking energy dimerization majorly occurred when the system was in the absence of model hs while cross coupling occurred conversely the reactivity and hydrophilicity of predominated mmtd intermediates and products in different pathways were predicted by dft method and was given in table s2 pre coupling to model hs avoided the formation of two difficult to oxidize intermediates mmtd dimers and sulfonated mmtd higher ehomo lumo and hardness indicated that an organic molecule is less reactive as was shown in table 1 the ehomo lumo of mmtd 4mcatq mmtd catq and mmtd quinone was 3 06 ev 3 10 ev 3 23 ev respectively all to be far lower than that of mmtd dimer 4 65 ev and sulfonated mmtd 4 91 ev higher nucleophilicity index indicated that the organic molecule is more likely to lose electrons and to be oxidized the nucleophilicity index of mmtd 4mcatq mmtd catq and mmtd quinone was 2 48 ev 2 37 ev 2 14 ev respectively which was higher than that of mmtd dimers 1 89 ev and sulfonated mmtd 1 39 ev this result also explained why no further oxidation of sulfonated mmtd was observed sulfonated mmtd kow 2 45 10 4 was neither easy to be further oxidized nor to be precipitated for its increased hydrophilicity compared to mmtd kow 2 54 although sulfonated mmtd was not likely to across cell membrane the thiadiazole ring it contained may pose other risk to the environment conversely hs pre coupled with mmtd may be returned to nature in forms of sulfonated hs which was much more environmentally friendly hs took part in the transformation of mmtd as a good radical generator good electron transfer intermediate and possible substrate pre coupling to model hs not only further decreased the thiadiazole ring breaking energy but also avoided the formation of difficult to oxidize and difficult to precipitate sulfonated mmtd which was preferred coupling pathways than dimerization fig 5 moreover the apparent transformation rate of mmtd by mno2 was much increased with the presence of model hs the presence and absence of hs largely affected the transformation rate pathways and products distribution by directly determining the coupling pathways of mmtd using real hs to couple mmtd can reduce the costs and simplify the separation process in developing coupling oxidation technologies however real hs in this work cannot efficiently remove mmtd for its low quinoid percentage the real hs applied in this work majorly coupled mmtd by generating semiquinone radicals chen et al 2010 see section 4 1 adding too many real hs may not only scavenge oxygen cristale et al 2017 and active site of mno2 li and hu 2016 but also quench many other reactive oxygen species bokare and choi 2015 coelho et al 2011 porras et al 2014 nowadays both natural hs and synthetic hs are available zou et al jianmei zou 2020 found that catechin can be polymerized to form hs with the presence of amino acid which is a possible way to produce hs with high quinoid percentage we believed that using synthetic hs with high quinoid percentage may reduce the costs and avoid the dimerization of mmtd at the same time in developing coupling oxidation technologies moreover compared to advanced oxidation processes coupling oxidation not only increased the toc removal and reduced the operating cost but also increased the selectivity of mmtd transformation dissolved organic solvents would not be transformed during coupling oxidation therefore subjecting easy to degrade organic solvents to bio degradation may also reduce the operating cost of complicated wastewater matrix 5 conclusion mmtd entering environment as pharmaceutical intermediate and metabolite of cefazolin and cefazedone is hundred times riskier than the antibiotics themselves however the transformation and final products of mmtd during wastewater treatment was not paid enough attention to our research found that mmtd can be efficiently transformed under weak oxidation conditions pre coupled to humic substances and further oxidized by metal oxides was a possible transformation pathway of mmtd which was named as a two step coupling oxidation process 1 mmtd can be removed with the presence of model hs or mno2 the coupling rate of mmtd was largely related to the presence of model hs mmtd initial concentration and the presence of protons metal cations mmtd was hardly transformed in air quinoid can efficiently cross couple mmtd 95 via nucleophilic substitution addition while phenolic structures cannot 20 when mmtd initial ranged from 75 to 300 μm the transformation rate of mmtd is around 5 10 3 mmtd initial min 1 with the presence of 2 mm 4mcat which followed zero order transformation kinetics the coupling of mmtd to humic substances would be inhibited by protons and metal cations via ionization moreover the presence of 4mcat increased the 4 hour removal of mmtd by mno2 from 72 4 to 92 4 which also changed the coupling pathways and final products the presence of 4mcat also increased the 2 hour toc removal of high concentrated mmtd by mno2 which was from 12 8 to 80 9 2 according to the esi tof ms and enthalpy change mmtd was cross coupled to quinoid via nucleophilic addition substitution and to semiquinone radicals via radical coupling under alkaline conditions with the presence of metal oxides mmtd was majorly dimerized to mmtd dimers intermediate via radical coupling a minor fraction of thiol group in mmtd would be directly oxidized to sulfonic acid and remained in the system both dimerized mmtd and model hs pre coupled mmtd would be further oxidized with the presence of mno2 mmtd dimers were oxidized to sulfonated mmtd while hs pre coupled mmtd were oxidized to sulfonated hs 3 cross coupling to model hs ehomo lumo 3 06 3 23 ev avoided the formation of two difficult to oxidized intermediates mmtd dimers ehomo lumo 4 65 ev and sulfonated mmtd ehomo lumo 4 91 ev compared to mmtd dimers nu 1 89 ev quinone coupled mmtd nu 2 14 2 48 ev were more reactive in the oxidation stage moreover no further oxidation of sulfonated mmtd was observed the thiadiazole ring contained in sulfonated mmtd may pose risk to the environment while no thiadiazole ring remained when coupled hs returned to nature in forms of sulfonated hs 4 thiadiazole ring in the coupled products was decyclized during the further oxidation after adding an o to the non cyclic s the thiadiazole ring was opened by a proton attack on α carbon with the γ carbon n bond broken at cn bond cleavage was the rearrangement of o to γ carbon and elimination of nitrogen on α carbon right after nitrogen elimination hydrolyzation occurred on α carbon to eliminate the proton and the s c o ch3 bond was hydrolyzed to acetaldehyde h c o ch3 and s oh which would be further oxidized to sulfonic acid group finally the carbon and cyclic s were released in the forms of carbon dioxide and sulfate ring atoms left the thiadiazole ring in the order of nitrogen acetaldehyde group sulfate carbon dioxide only the non cyclic s remained in the coupled products in fact pre coupling enabled the further decyclization of thiadiazole by decreasing the ring breaking energy 338 kj mol where coupled to 4mcat decreased the energy by 20 274 kj mol and dimerization decreased the energy by 15 286 kj mol thiadiazole decyclization indicated fully degradation of mmtd which was not achieved in ozonation as thiadiazole poses potential risk to the environment breaking the thiadiazole ring ensured that mmtd is no longer a threat the aim of wastewater treatment is to reproduce some natural degradation or separation processes of pollutants in a relatively short period kim et al 2007 due to the low toc removal of mmtd in some advanced oxidation process e g ozonation coupling oxidation is a promising process in efficiently transform mmtd at low energy cost and can be used to develop novel green technologies in treating pharmaceutical wastewater humic substances is an important reagent in developing coupling oxidation technologies although adding dissolved humic acid may increase the chemical oxidation demand cod and total organic carbon toc of pharmaceutical wastewater coupling to humic acid actually accelerated the degradation and further decreased the environmental risk of the emerging pollutants during weak oxidation moreover the transformed hs can be removed via coagulation which was a common step of current pharmaceutical wastewater treatment processes author contributions the manuscript

17552,in this study the fate of organophosphate esters opes in conventional and advanced drinking water treatment plants dwtps was investigated in field scale in addition the risk of opes by drinking water was assessed the average total ope concentrations in raw and treated water were lower in the rainy season 94 3 and 57 1 ng l respectively than dry season 163 and 84 2 ng l respectively advanced dwtps showed better removal efficiencies of major opes rather than those in conventional dwtps the average removal rates for two chlorinated opes including tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep and tris 1 chloro 2 propyl phosphate tcipp were negative tcep 87 tcipp 41 for a conventional dwtp but positive tcep 46 tcipp 49 for advanced dwtps using granular activated carbon filtration the average removal rates for advanced dwtps were statistically higher for the alkyl aryl opes tri n butyl phosphate tnbp 67 and tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate tboep 63 than those for the conventional dwtps tnbp 21 tboep 25 the hazardous quotient hq of major opes were lower for advanced dwtps and water irrigated from upstream sties reservoir compared to that of conventional dwtps and water irrigated from downstream sites we believe that this is the first comparison of ope removal efficiencies achieved in conventional and advanced dwtps keywords organophosphate esters seasonal occurrence removal drinking water treatment plant risk assessment 1 introduction these days the occurrence of trace pollutants in water system is being a social and environmental issues and various pollutants are regarding as emerging contaminants among these organophosphate esters opes used as flame retardants and plasticizers are considered emerging compounds because of their ubiquitous detection as the alternatives to brominated flame retardants bfrs resulting from the restrictions on and the phasing out of polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes marklund et al 2005 greaves and letcher 2016 in addition opes have relatively high water solubility 280 7000 mg l and cause concern according to their frequent detection in freshwater systems around the world benotti et al 2009 rodil et al 2012 because the river water is used as sources of drinking water in most cities ope levels in river water can pose risks to people consuming the drinking water produced by many dwtps lee and schwab 2005 deblonde et al 2011 lee et al 2016 choo et al 2018 to date ope studies have been performed in river water and reported the concentrations ranging from 62 8 to 961 ng l in south korea choo et al 2018 13 20 650 ng l in the uk cristale et al 2013 and 1060 ng l in australia teo et al 2015 like the case of river water the high concentration and detection frequencies of opes were also reported in drinking water li et al 2014 lee et al 2016 however despite the existence of purification processes the ope levels in drinking water china 85 1 325 ng l south korea below the limit of detection to 1660 ng l were similar or slightly lower than those in river water that was widely used as drinking water source suggesting that efforts need to be made to ensure the ope decontamination of water sources supplying dwtps and their efficient removal in dwtps previous studies of ope removal from water have been mostly focused on wastewater treatment plants wwtps and the removal efficiencies varied according to the types of opes comprising alkyl aryl and chlorinated opes andresen and bester 2006 cristale et al 2013 schreder and la guardia 2014 kim et al 2016 liang and liu 2016 in a wwtp o3 and uv h2o2 treatments can effectively eliminate alkyl opes including tri n butyl phosphate tnbp and tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate tboep in laboratory and field studies yuan et al 2015 cristale et al 2016 on the other hand only few studies investigated on removal of chlorinated opes despite chlorinated opes being the dominant opes in water lee et al 2016 park et al 2018 chlorinated opes such as tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep and tris 1 chloro 2 propyl phosphate tcipp are not efficiently removed during typical waste water treatment processes such as ozonation and biodegradation processes cristale et al 2013 kim et al 2016 liang and liu 2016 only one field scale study on ope removal in dwtps is available and the effective removal of chlorinated opes giving a removal efficiency of up to 90 was reported by combination of slow passage through soil with a 10 15 d residence time and passage through an activated carbon filter andresen and bester 2006 however the combination of natural purification processes is difficult to apply in modern dwtps which requires a large amount of capacity in a short time their fate and removal especially for chlorinated opes in dwtps should be re evaluated in the modern water treatment process compared to conventional processes therefore the main objectives of this study was to investigate the removal efficiency of chlorinated alkyl aryl opes in conventional and advanced dwtps in field scale in addition the seasonal changes and distribution of opes in raw and treated water were examined finally ope daily intakes dis and hazard quotients hqs via the consumption of drinking water treated in the study area were estimated and compared according to the different drinking water sources 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals nine opes were used in the study triethyl phosphate

were purchased from accustandard new haven ct usa tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate tboep and tris 2 ethylhexyl phosphate tehp were obtained from wellington laboratories guelph canada deuterated opes tcep d12 tcipp d18 tdcipp d15 and tpp d15 were purchased from cambridge isotope laboratories andover ma usa and were used as internal standards phenanthrene d10 accustandard was used as a recovery standard 2 2 sampling campaign five dwtps dwtp a e along the nakdong river south korea that receive river water and another dwtp f in the same province that receives reservoir water were selected to investigate ope occurrence from dwtps with different drinking water sources the location and treatment processes used in each dwtp are shown in fig 1 and detailed information of dwtps is given in table s1 despite of using river water as drinking water source there are many point sources like wwtps and industrial complexes etc along the nakdong river basin resulting the chemical contamination problems in drinking water of this area especially there are two large national industrial complexes near the dwtp c and d fig 1 dwtp a was a conventional dwtp using chlorination coagulation sedimentation and filtration processes dwtp b f used conventional processes and also advanced processes such as granular activated carbon gac filters and ozonation processes the raw and treated water samples were collected from the dwtps in june august october and december 2017 i e in and out samples in each six dwtp for four times a total of 48 samples were collected to assess ope contamination and the risks posed to humans by opes in drinking water in addition in dwtp f the water samples in each treatment process were collected in december 2017 to determine the ope removal efficiency of each treatment process i e in and out samples in six treatment steps a total of seven samples were collected 2 l of water samples were collected in a pre cleaned glass bottle the samples were stored in an icebox at 4 c while being transported and then at 20 c until analysis 2 3 analytical procedure and analysis the analytical and instrumental methods used to determine the nine opes in the water samples have been described in detail previously choo et al 2018 park et al 2018 briefly 100 500 ml of unfiltered water sample was spiked with 10 ng of each internal standard and then solid phase

in fig 2 the raw and treated water samples collected from dwtp a e in august had the lowest average concentrations of total opes raw 86 3 ng l treated 43 2 ng l which might be related with the dilution effects due to the heavy precipitation rates in summer season of south korea august 138 3 mm as reported by several studies vega et al 1998 chen et al 2016 sun et al 2018 after then the average ope concentrations of raw and treated water gradually increased since the early part of the dry season october 102 and 71 0 ng l december 153 and 91 5 ng l june 172 and 76 9 ng l respectively according to much lower precipitation values october 82 5 mm december 10 6 mm june 49 8 mm rather than those in summer season however no seasonal variations were found in the ope concentrations in the dwtp f samples raw 96 3 8 23 ng l treated 63 8 2 38 ng l where receives water from a reservoir fig 1 this suggests that the ope concentrations in the influent raw water source the reservoir were relatively stable and unaffected by environmental factors particularly precipitation compared with the concentrations in nakdong river water consistent with the results of a previous study of an urban lake in germany regnery and püttmann 2010a b 3 2 removal of opes during drinking water treatment processes the removal efficiencies of six frequently detected opes tcipp tcep tep tnbp tboep and tphp which had detection frequencies up to 80 for the dwtps are shown in fig 3 tep had relatively low removal efficiencies 0 325 15 0 in all of the dwtps poor removal efficiencies 40 were found for tep in wwtps in a previous study and this was found to be caused by its less resistancy to degradation than the other opes cao et al 2012 cristale et al 2013 choo et al 2018 the conventional dwtp dwtp a and advanced dwtps dwtp b f had rather different removal efficiencies for the other opes the alkyl opes tnbp and tboep the aryl ope tphp and the chlorinated opes tcipp and tcep as can be seen from fig 3 negative total ope removal efficiencies of 29 6 to 1 92 were found for the conventional dwtp dwtp a particularly for the chlorinated opes removal efficiencies 70 0 to 13 5 for tcipp and 139 to 75 9 for tcep this indicated that conventional water treatment processes chlorination sedimentation and filtration did not effectively remove chlorinated opes the results for dwtp a were similar to results for conventional wwtps found in previous studies in which negative removal efficiencies of 80 to 10 and poor resistance of tcipp and tcep to biodegradation and ozonation in wwtps using anaerobic anoxic aerobic bioreactors and activated sludge treatments were found liang and liu 2016 kim et al 2017 it has been suggested that tcipp and tcep adsorbed to particles can re dissolve in the aqueous phase during water treatment processes because they are relatively soluble and that tcipp and tcep can form from precursor compounds during water treatment processes bester 2007 liang and liu 2016 kim et al 2017 our results could be explained by either or both of these on the other hand positive removal efficiencies of 23 2 69 1 were found for chlorinated opes tcipp 21 5 70 1 tcep 13 7 82 0 in the five advanced dwtps dwtp b f in addition markedly higher removal efficiencies were found for the alkyl opes tnbp 44 3 89 5 tboep 30 7 91 9 and aryl ope tphp 22 2 87 8 for the five advanced dwtps while the tnbp tboep and tphp removal efficiencies for the conventional dwtp dwtp a were 40 13 3 26 7 18 8 33 0 and 13 1 32 8 for tnbp tboep and tphp respectively mann whitney u test p 0 05 we compared the ope removal between conventional and advanced dwtps for the first time and these results indicated that advanced treatment processes i e ozonation and gac filtration are important for removing the major opes especially it is pertinent to show the differences in the removal rate of chlorinated opes through the advanced treatment processes as research is generally lacking on their effective removal in drinking water treatment plants additionally the effects of the advanced drinking water treatment processes that could remove opes pre chlorine pre ozone sedimentation filtration post ozone and gac filtration treatments on the removal efficiencies were assessed by analyzing water samples taken before and after each process in dwtp f which received water from a reservoir meaning the ope concentrations in the influent were more stable than the concentrations in river water as shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 4 by chemicals and figure s1 by process all nine opes were mostly removed by a combination of gac filtration which removed 37 0 pre ozone treatment which removed 15 2 filtration which removed 7 55 and sedimentation which removed 6 14 gac filtration and ozonation together removed around 50 of the total ope concentrations from the raw water in particular tcipp and tcep were mostly removed by the gac process with 84 and 49 efficiencies respectively followed by filtration tcipp 13 tcep 16 and sedimentation tcipp 10 tcep 12 processes high tcipp and tcep removal efficiencies of up to 90 have been found in only one previous study of conventional dwtps in that study the chlorinated opes tcipp and tcep were removed effectively by a combination of slow percolation through soil with a residence time of 10 15 d and activated carbon filtration andresen and bester 2006 these results suggested that gac filtration used in dwtp b f could be the key process involved in removing chlorinated opes in advanced dwtps however the negative removal of tcipp and tcep can be still seen in other conventional processes of dwtp f including prechlorine tcipp 14 8 tcep 0 2 preozone tcipp 2 27 tcep 3 74 and postozone tcipp 20 7 tcep 6 82 alkyl and aryl opes were most effectively removed in the pre ozonation treatment which gave tnbp tboep tphp and tep removal efficiencies of 43 1 40 9 46 5 and 7 77 respectively and the post ozonation treatment which gave tnbp tboep tphp and tep removal efficiencies of 21 8 21 3 1 74 and 11 6 respectively because ozone selectively attacks aromatic rings and aliphatic chains the chlorinated opes were more recalcitrant less reactive in the ozonation treatments as was also found in previous studies cristale et al 2016 kim et al 2017 effective alkyl and aryl ope removal during ozonation treatment in wwtps has been found to occur through direct oxidation by molecular o3 indirect oxidation by oh radicals generated in chain reactions between ozone and hydroxide ions and direct photolysis by uv in laboratory studies yuan et al 2015 and wastewater monitoring field studies cristale et al 2016 liang and liu 2016 3 3 risk assessment of opes via the water consumption and the risk effect of different water sources the potential risks posed by opes in drinking water to humans of different ages consuming the drinking water were assessed by calculating dis for total opes and individual opes using the median and highest concentrations as shown in table s3 the median and highest estimated total ope dis in ng kg body weight day were 2 28 and 4 16 respectively for toddlers 1 87 and 3 42 respectively for children 1 13 and 2 06 respectively for teenagers and 1 62 and 2 95 respectively for adults in addition the hq which indicates non carcinogenic risks was calculated from the dis and reported rfds for the main individual opes for the different dwtps as shown in fig 5 and table s4 the estimated hqs for the individual opes for drinking water consumption ranged from 10 5 to 10 3 indicating that the risks were acceptable defined as hq 1 with a three five order of magnitude safety margin even though the non carcinogenic risks posed by opes in drinking water were found to be negligible the hqs increased from dwtp b to d i e as the source of water moved from the mid part to the downstream part of the nakdong river especially the highest hqs were observed in dwtp d which might be resulted from industrial complexes located between dwtp c and d on the other hand the lowest hqs were found for dwtp b and f which received upstream river water and a reservoir in a mountainous area respectively this implies that ope contamination of the raw water source directly affected drinking water safety even though opes were removed during the treatment processes we also found a direct relationship between the total ope concentrations in raw and treated water spearman correlation r 0 588 p 0 01 exceptionally dwtp a which has only coagulation and filteration located in upstream of nakdong river showed similar hq values to drinking water produced by the dwtps receiving raw water from the mid and downstream dwtp c e suggesting the importance of gac filtration and ozonation treatment to enhance drinking water safety 4 conclusion little information is available on ope concentrations in water processed in dwtps and on opfr removal efficiencies achieved in dwtps this is the first study in which ope removal efficiencies for conventional and advanced drinking water treatment processes have been determined and in which the effects of different raw water sources upstream to downstream in a river and a reservoir on ope concentrations in drinking water have been compared opes were not removed effectively the mean removal efficiency was 40 in the advanced treatment processes but chlorinated opes including tcipp and tcep were removed more effectively by gac filtration than the other processes alkyl opes tnbp and tboep and an aryl ope tphp were removed more effectively by ozonation treatments than by the other processes the risks posed to humans by opes in drinking water varied greatly depending on the raw water source and treatment processes used suggesting that it is important to manage the sources of raw water carefully to ensure the safety of drinking water further laboratory and field studies should be performed to investigate the effects of different treatment processes raw water

17552,in this study the fate of organophosphate esters opes in conventional and advanced drinking water treatment plants dwtps was investigated in field scale in addition the risk of opes by drinking water was assessed the average total ope concentrations in raw and treated water were lower in the rainy season 94 3 and 57 1 ng l respectively than dry season 163 and 84 2 ng l respectively advanced dwtps showed better removal efficiencies of major opes rather than those in conventional dwtps the average removal rates for two chlorinated opes including tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep and tris 1 chloro 2 propyl phosphate tcipp were negative tcep 87 tcipp 41 for a conventional dwtp but positive tcep 46 tcipp 49 for advanced dwtps using granular activated carbon filtration the average removal rates for advanced dwtps were statistically higher for the alkyl aryl opes tri n butyl phosphate tnbp 67 and tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate tboep 63 than those for the conventional dwtps tnbp 21 tboep 25 the hazardous quotient hq of major opes were lower for advanced dwtps and water irrigated from upstream sties reservoir compared to that of conventional dwtps and water irrigated from downstream sites we believe that this is the first comparison of ope removal efficiencies achieved in conventional and advanced dwtps keywords organophosphate esters seasonal occurrence removal drinking water treatment plant risk assessment 1 introduction these days the occurrence of trace pollutants in water system is being a social and environmental issues and various pollutants are regarding as emerging contaminants among these organophosphate esters opes used as flame retardants and plasticizers are considered emerging compounds because of their ubiquitous detection as the alternatives to brominated flame retardants bfrs resulting from the restrictions on and the phasing out of polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes marklund et al 2005 greaves and letcher 2016 in addition opes have relatively high water solubility 280 7000 mg l and cause concern according to their frequent detection in freshwater systems around the world benotti et al 2009 rodil et al 2012 because the river water is used as sources of drinking water in most cities ope levels in river water can pose risks to people consuming the drinking water produced by many dwtps lee and schwab 2005 deblonde et al 2011 lee et al 2016 choo et al 2018 to date ope studies have been performed in river water and reported the concentrations ranging from 62 8 to 961 ng l in south korea choo et al 2018 13 20 650 ng l in the uk cristale et al 2013 and 1060 ng l in australia teo et al 2015 like the case of river water the high concentration and detection frequencies of opes were also reported in drinking water li et al 2014 lee et al 2016 however despite the existence of purification processes the ope levels in drinking water china 85 1 325 ng l south korea below the limit of detection to 1660 ng l were similar or slightly lower than those in river water that was widely used as drinking water source suggesting that efforts need to be made to ensure the ope decontamination of water sources supplying dwtps and their efficient removal in dwtps previous studies of ope removal from water have been mostly focused on wastewater treatment plants wwtps and the removal efficiencies varied according to the types of opes comprising alkyl aryl and chlorinated opes andresen and bester 2006 cristale et al 2013 schreder and la guardia 2014 kim et al 2016 liang and liu 2016 in a wwtp o3 and uv h2o2 treatments can effectively eliminate alkyl opes including tri n butyl phosphate tnbp and tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate tboep in laboratory and field studies yuan et al 2015 cristale et al 2016 on the other hand only few studies investigated on removal of chlorinated opes despite chlorinated opes being the dominant opes in water lee et al 2016 park et al 2018 chlorinated opes such as tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep and tris 1 chloro 2 propyl phosphate tcipp are not efficiently removed during typical waste water treatment processes such as ozonation and biodegradation processes cristale et al 2013 kim et al 2016 liang and liu 2016 only one field scale study on ope removal in dwtps is available and the effective removal of chlorinated opes giving a removal efficiency of up to 90 was reported by combination of slow passage through soil with a 10 15 d residence time and passage through an activated carbon filter andresen and bester 2006 however the combination of natural purification processes is difficult to apply in modern dwtps which requires a large amount of capacity in a short time their fate and removal especially for chlorinated opes in dwtps should be re evaluated in the modern water treatment process compared to conventional processes therefore the main objectives of this study was to investigate the removal efficiency of chlorinated alkyl aryl opes in conventional and advanced dwtps in field scale in addition the seasonal changes and distribution of opes in raw and treated water were examined finally ope daily intakes dis and hazard quotients hqs via the consumption of drinking water treated in the study area were estimated and compared according to the different drinking water sources 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals nine opes were used in the study triethyl phosphate

2 2 sampling campaign five dwtps dwtp a e along the nakdong river south korea that receive river water and another dwtp f in the same province that receives reservoir water were selected to investigate ope occurrence from dwtps with different drinking water sources the location and treatment processes used in each dwtp are shown in fig 1 and detailed information of dwtps is given in table s1 despite of using river water as drinking water source there are many point sources like wwtps and industrial complexes etc along the nakdong river basin resulting the chemical contamination

sedimentation and filtration processes dwtp b f used conventional processes and also advanced processes such as granular activated carbon gac filters and ozonation processes the raw and treated water samples were collected from the dwtps in june august october and december 2017 i e in and out samples in each six dwtp for four times a total of 48 samples were collected to assess ope contamination and the risks posed to humans by opes in drinking water in addition in dwtp f the water samples in each treatment process were collected in december 2017 to determine the ope removal efficiency of

advanced dwtps dwtp b f had rather different removal efficiencies for the other opes the alkyl opes tnbp and tboep the aryl ope tphp and the chlorinated opes tcipp and tcep as can be seen from fig 3 negative total ope removal efficiencies of 29 6 to 1 92 were found for the conventional dwtp dwtp a particularly for the chlorinated opes removal efficiencies 70 0 to 13 5 for tcipp and 139 to 75 9 for tcep this indicated that conventional water treatment processes chlorination sedimentation and filtration did not effectively remove chlorinated opes the results for dwtp a were similar to results for conventional wwtps found in previous studies in which negative removal efficiencies of 80 to 10 and poor resistance of tcipp and tcep to biodegradation and ozonation in wwtps using anaerobic anoxic aerobic bioreactors and activated sludge treatments were found liang and liu 2016 kim et al 2017 it has been suggested that tcipp and tcep adsorbed to particles can re dissolve in the aqueous phase during water treatment processes because they are relatively soluble and that tcipp and tcep can form from precursor compounds during water treatment processes bester 2007 liang and liu 2016 kim et al 2017 our results could be explained by either or both of these on the other hand positive removal efficiencies of 23 2 69 1 were found for chlorinated opes tcipp 21 5 70 1 tcep 13 7 82 0 in the five advanced dwtps dwtp b f in addition markedly higher removal efficiencies were found for the alkyl opes tnbp 44 3 89 5 tboep 30 7 91 9 and aryl ope tphp 22 2 87 8 for the five advanced dwtps while the tnbp tboep and tphp removal efficiencies for the conventional dwtp dwtp a were 40 13 3 26 7 18 8 33 0 and 13 1 32 8 for tnbp tboep and tphp respectively mann whitney u test p 0 05 we compared the ope removal between conventional and advanced dwtps for the first time and these results indicated that advanced treatment processes i e ozonation and gac filtration are important for removing the major opes especially it is pertinent to show the differences in the removal rate of chlorinated opes through the advanced treatment processes as research is generally lacking on their effective removal in drinking water treatment plants additionally the effects of the advanced drinking water treatment processes that could remove opes pre chlorine pre ozone sedimentation filtration post ozone and gac filtration treatments on the removal efficiencies were assessed by analyzing water samples taken before and after each process in dwtp f which received water from a reservoir meaning the ope concentrations in the influent were more stable than the concentrations in river water as shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 4 by chemicals and figure s1 by process all nine opes were mostly removed by a combination of gac filtration which removed 37 0 pre ozone treatment which removed 15 2 filtration which removed 7 55 and sedimentation which removed 6 14 gac filtration and ozonation together removed around 50 of the total ope concentrations from the raw water in particular tcipp and tcep were mostly removed by the gac process with 84 and 49 efficiencies respectively followed by filtration tcipp 13 tcep 16 and sedimentation tcipp 10 tcep 12 processes high tcipp and tcep removal efficiencies of up to 90 have been found in only one previous study of conventional dwtps in that study the chlorinated opes tcipp and tcep were removed effectively by a combination of slow percolation through soil with a residence time of 10 15 d and activated carbon filtration andresen and bester 2006 these results suggested that gac filtration used in dwtp b f could be the key process involved in removing chlorinated opes in advanced dwtps however the negative removal of tcipp and tcep can be still seen in other conventional processes of dwtp f including prechlorine tcipp 14 8 tcep 0 2 preozone tcipp 2 27 tcep 3 74 and postozone tcipp 20 7 tcep 6 82 alkyl and aryl opes were most effectively removed in the pre ozonation treatment which gave tnbp tboep tphp and tep removal efficiencies of 43 1 40 9 46 5 and 7 77 respectively and the post ozonation treatment which gave tnbp tboep tphp and tep removal efficiencies of 21 8 21 3 1 74 and 11 6 respectively because ozone selectively attacks aromatic rings and aliphatic chains the chlorinated opes were more recalcitrant less reactive in the ozonation treatments as was also found in previous studies cristale et al 2016 kim et al 2017 effective alkyl and aryl ope removal during ozonation treatment in wwtps has been found to occur through direct oxidation by molecular o3 indirect oxidation by oh radicals generated in chain reactions between ozone and hydroxide ions and direct photolysis by uv in laboratory studies yuan et al 2015 and wastewater monitoring field studies cristale et al 2016 liang and liu 2016 3 3 risk assessment of opes via the water consumption and the risk effect of different water sources the potential risks posed by opes in drinking water to humans of different ages consuming the drinking water were assessed by calculating dis for total opes and individual opes using the median and highest concentrations as shown in table s3 the median and highest estimated total ope dis in ng kg body weight day were 2 28 and 4 16 respectively for toddlers 1 87 and 3 42 respectively for children 1 13 and 2 06 respectively for teenagers and 1 62 and 2 95 respectively for adults in addition the hq which indicates non carcinogenic risks was calculated from the dis and reported rfds for the main individual opes for the different dwtps as shown in fig 5 and table s4 the estimated hqs for the individual opes for drinking water consumption ranged from 10 5 to 10 3 indicating that the risks were acceptable defined as hq 1 with a three five order of magnitude safety margin even though the non carcinogenic risks posed by opes in drinking water were found to be negligible the hqs increased from dwtp b to d i e as the source of water moved from the mid part to the downstream part of the nakdong river especially the highest hqs were observed in dwtp d which might be resulted from industrial complexes located between dwtp c and d on the other hand the lowest hqs were found for dwtp b and f which received upstream river water and a reservoir in a mountainous area respectively this implies that ope contamination of the raw water source directly affected drinking water safety even though opes were removed during the treatment processes we also found a direct relationship between the total ope concentrations in raw and treated water spearman correlation r 0 588 p 0 01 exceptionally dwtp a which has only coagulation and filteration located in upstream of nakdong river showed similar hq values to drinking water produced by the dwtps receiving raw water from the mid and downstream dwtp c e suggesting the importance of gac filtration and ozonation treatment to enhance drinking water safety 4 conclusion little information is available on ope concentrations in water processed in dwtps and on opfr removal efficiencies achieved in dwtps this is the first study in which ope removal efficiencies for conventional and advanced drinking water treatment processes have been determined and in which the effects of different raw water sources upstream to downstream in a river and a reservoir on ope concentrations in drinking water have been compared opes were not removed effectively the mean removal efficiency was 40 in the advanced treatment processes but chlorinated opes including tcipp and tcep were removed more effectively by gac filtration than the other processes alkyl opes tnbp and tboep and an aryl ope tphp were removed more effectively by ozonation treatments than by the other processes the risks posed to humans by opes in drinking water varied greatly depending on the raw water source and treatment processes used suggesting that it is important to manage the sources of raw water carefully to ensure the safety of drinking water further laboratory and field studies should be performed to investigate the effects of different treatment processes raw water

17553,ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob of the betaproteobacterial genera nitrosomonas and nitrosospira are key nitrifying microorganisms in many natural and engineered ecosystems since many aob remain uncultured fluorescence in situ hybridization fish with rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes has been one of the most widely used approaches to study the community composition abundance and other features of aob directly in environmental samples however the established and widely used aob specific 16s rrna targeted fish probes were designed up to two decades ago based on much smaller rrna gene sequence datasets than available today several of these probes cover their target aob lineages incompletely and suffer from a weak target specificity which causes cross hybridization of probes that should detect different aob lineages here a set of new highly specific 16s rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes was developed and experimentally evaluated that complements the existing probes and enables the specific detection and differentiation of the known major phylogenetic clusters of betaproteobacterial aob the new probes were successfully applied to visualize and quantify aob in activated sludge and biofilm samples from seven pilot and full scale wastewater treatment systems based on its improved target group coverage and specificity the refined probe set will facilitate future in situ analyses of aob graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fluorescence in situ hybridization ammonia oxidizing bacteria nitrification wastewater treatment plants oligonucleotide probes 1 introduction nitrification a key process in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle is the microbially mediated oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and subsequently to nitrate for many decades nitrification was perceived as a process always performed by two functional groups of aerobic chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms in cooperation the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and archaea aoa which oxidize ammonia to nitrite and the nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob that oxidize nitrite to nitrate bock and wagner 2001 daims et al 2016 könneke et al 2005 only recently complete ammonia oxidizers comammox organisms have been discovered which carry out the entire nitrification process alone daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 currently all known canonical aob oxidizing ammonia to nitrite belong to one of two phylogenetic lineages within the proteobacteria gammaproteobacterial aob include the genus nitrosococcus which is halophilic and occurs in marine habitats and salt lakes campbell et al 2011 and the genus nitrosoglobus which contains acidotolerant aob from acidic soils hayatsu et al 2017 in contrast the aob that usually dominate in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems belong to the family nitrosomonadaceae within the now obsolete parks et al 2018 taxonomic class of betaproteobacteria prosser et al 2014 here we refer to these organisms as β aob all cultivated and described members of the family nitrosomonadaceae are chemolithoautotrophic aob from the genera nitrosomonas and nitrosospira prosser et al 2014 representatives of β aob are found in almost all oxic environments but are particularly successful in nutrient rich habitats such as fertilized soils or eutrophic freshwater sediments and also the majority of wastewater treatment plants wwtps bollmann et al 2014 di et al 2010 fan et al 2011 verhamme et al 2011 the low abundance of aoa in activated sludge from most municipal wwtps gao et al 2013 mußmann et al 2011 wells et al 2009 has recently been attributed to their sensitivity to copper limitation caused by chemical complexation of copper by organic compounds gwak et al 2019 this effect likely contributes to the commonly observed predominance of β aob in these engineered environments despite their ubiquity β aob have proven to be exceptionally fastidious and recalcitrant to cultivation hence the number of β aob isolates with standing in nomenclature parte 2014 remains low n 14 despite their broad environmental distribution and high ecological significance to overcome this problem researchers use cultivation independent molecular techniques for studying various aspects of aob diversity and ecophysiology one of the most commonly applied molecular methods is rrna targeted fluorescence in situ hybridization fish this approach uses rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes which are covalently linked to fluorescent dyes and hybridize to the ribosomal rna of specific microbial populations amann et al 1995 delong et al 1989 the resulting fluorescence signal allows the in situ detection and visualization of target organisms in environmental samples fish has numerous applications in microbial ecology which include the in situ abundance quantification of populations daims and wagner 2007 wagner et al 1994 and quantitative analyses of the spatial distribution of microorganisms in biofilms and other structurally complex samples almstrand et al 2013 daims et al 2006 dolinšek et al 2013 schillinger et al 2012 welch et al 2016 combinations of fish with chemical imaging techniques like microautoradiography lee et al 1999 raman microspectroscopy fernando et al 2019 huang et al 2007 and nanometer scale secondary ion mass spectroscopy nanosims berry et al 2013 musat et al 2012 even permit cultivation independent physiological studies of discrete microbial populations fish can also be used together with bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging boncat which is another powerful approach to detect metabolically active microorganisms in situ hatzenpichler et al 2014 fish has been applied since 1995 wagner et al 1995 in numerous studies to investigate β aob in aquatic systems especially wwtps and has proven to be of immense value in this context for example nitrosomonas formerly nitrosococcus mobilis was identified as the dominant aob in an industrial wwtp juretschko et al 1998 and later isolated from activated sludge by fish assisted screening and propagation of sorted microcolonies fujitani et al 2015 fish and image analysis were used to quantify the spatial localization patterns of β aob in nitrifying biofilms almstrand et al 2013 gruber dorninger et al 2015 maixner et al 2006 by combining fish detection with microsensor measurements of substrate concentration gradients both the distribution and activities of β aob in biofilms were studied okabe et al 1999 schramm et al 1998 application of this approach to calculate volumetric reaction rates even revealed the in situ whole cell kinetics of uncultured β aob nitrosospira spp schramm et al 1999 in another study fish and quantitative pcr qpcr were used to detect β aob in granular activated sludge these data were the basis for two ecophysiological models which address the observed and unexpected higher in situ abundances of nob over aob in the granules winkler et al 2012 fish was also used to quantify the abundance dynamics of diverse β aob and anaerobic ammonium oxidizers anammox in ammonium or urea fed enrichments revealing different substrate preferences of the populations sliekers et al 2004 and to analyze the spatial organization of β aob and anammox organisms in nitrogen removing biofilms pynaert et al 2003 since the validation of methods is crucial a recent comparison of fish and qpcr as tools to quantify the abundance of β aob deserves attention it revealed that fish and amoa targeted qpcr yielded consistent results whereas qpcr of 16s rrna genes underestimated the abundance of β aob baptista et al 2014 these and many other studies used a well established set of rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes to detect all β aob or their sublineages by fish adamczyk et al 2003 juretschko et al 2002 1998 mobarry et al 1996 wagner et al 1995 however the most commonly used probes were designed based on a much more limited set of 16s rrna sequences from β aob than is available now and they do not cover the entire diversity of β aob represented in current databases moreover inconsistent in situ hybridization patterns were observed which suggested that some of these probes hybridize to β aob outside the expected target groups gruber dorninger et al 2015 an incomplete probe coverage and weak specificity can introduce a significant bias in studies that rely on these probes to detect and quantify β aob and to distinguish different β aob lineages hence an updated set of β aob specific fish probes is urgently needed here we introduce new β aob specific rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes which complement and refine the existing probe set and enable the identification visualization and quantification of all currently known β aob lineages following probe design and evaluation the specificity and applicability of the new probes were tested with activated sludge and biofilm samples from municipal and industrial wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 in silico design of 16s rrna targeted probes and phylogenetic analyses the new rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes table 1 were designed using the probe design and probe match functions of the arb software package version 6 0 6 ludwig et al 2004 and the silva ref nr99 release 132 ssu rrna sequence database quast et al 2013 the database was amended with 46 additional full length 16s rrna gene sequences of β aob from full scale wwtps in denmark dueholm et al 2020 which were retrieved from the midas database mcilroy et al 2015 nierychlo et al 2020 the probe match tool of arb was also used to evaluate the target group coverage and specificity of the previously published and the new fish probes for β aob these analyses and the probe specificity checks outside of the β aob used silva ref nr99 release 138 amended with the 46 sequences from midas see above a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was calculated based on an alignment sina aligner pruesse et al 2012 of 505 reference sequences of β aob from the aforementioned databases using w iq tree trifinopoulos et al 2016 with 1000 bootstrap iterations a previous phylogenetic study had found that different treeing methods including maximum likelihood yielded consistent tree topologies at the level of the major β aob lineages and with the 16s rrna gene as marker purkhold et al 2003 tim3e g4 was determined by modelfinder to be the best fitting base substitution model for the calculation kalyaanamoorthy et al 2017 the resulting tree was visualized with itol letunic and bork 2019 bacterial 16s rrna amplicon sequence data v1 3 region from 88 samples from the five danish wastewater treatment plants table 2 were retrieved from the midas database mcilroy et al 2015 and used to determine the mean amplicon abundances of β aob classified as nitrosomonas and nitrosospira amplicon reads were dereplicated and formatted for use in the usearch unoise workflow edgar 2016a dereplicated reads were used to generate amplicon sequence variants using the usearch version 10 unoise3 tool with default settings taxonomy was assigned using the sintax classifier edgar 2016b in usearch version 11 using the silva release 138 taxonomy the results were analyzed in r r core team 2016 using the ampvis2 r package 2 5 https github com madsalbertsen ampvis2 2 2 cultivation and fixation of β aob pure cultures pure cultures of the β aob nitrosospira briensis nsp1 nitrosospira multiformis ni13 nitrosomonas europaea nm50 nitrosomonas eutropha nm57 nitrosomonas oligotropha nm75 and nitrosomonas sp nm51 an unnamed species from the nitrosomonas marina lineage were grown as described earlier koops et al 1991 nitrosomonas communis nm2 was grown in a modified aob medium according to zhou et al 2019 all cultures were harvested 40 ml during the logarithmic growth phase and centrifuged 4000 g room temperature 20 min to collect the biomass the supernatant was removed and the cell pellets were resuspended in a 3 w v formaldehyde solution for fixation 1 h at room temperature as detailed elsewhere daims et al 2005 the fixed cultures were washed twice in a 1 pbs phosphate buffered saline solution centrifuged 12 000 g at room temperature for 8 min and then resuspended in a 1 1 mixture of 1 pbs and 96 v v ethanol and stored at 20 c until further processing daims et al 2005 2 3 sampling and fixation of activated sludge activated sludge or biofilm detached suspended particles samples taken at several wwtps in austria germany and denmark were analyzed table 2 the samples were centrifuged 20 817 g 4 c 15 min the supernatant was removed and the sludge was resuspended in a 2 v v samples from sbbr1 knb and ing or 4 v v all other samples formaldehyde solution for fixation 3 h 4 c lukumbuzya et al 2019 nielsen 2009 the sludge samples were subsequently washed twice in 1 pbs resuspended in a 1 1 mixture of 1 pbs and 96 v v ethanol and stored at 20 c until further processing 2 4 recombinant 16s rrna expression for clone fish we could not obtain cells of the isolates nitrosomonas cryotolerans targeted by the new probe nm cr 998 and nitrosomonas sp nm143 targeted by probe nm 143 1010 table 1 furthermore no isolate is available from a nitrosomonas communis related cluster detected in some wwtps in denmark table 2 for which we designed the new probe nm ni 1026 table 1 in order to evaluate the new probes that are specific for these β aob and their close relatives the respective 16s rrna was heterologously expressed in e coli for clone fish schramm et al 2002 briefly synthetic strings dna fragments thermofisher scientific of full length 16s rrna genes were cloned into e coli novablue competent cells using the novagen petblue 1 perfectly blunt cloning kit merck the e coli cells were grown to an od of 0 3 0 4 1 mm of iptg was added to the cultures and the cells were incubated 1 h 200 r p m 37 c subsequently chloramphenicol 170 mg l l was added to increase the intracellular accumulation of rna including the heterologously expressed 16s rrna schramm et al 2002 and the cells were incubated at 4 c for 4 hours finally the cells were fixed in formaldehyde as described above for the β aob isolates 2 5 fluorescence in situ hybridization microscopy and digital image analysis fish of all β aob pure cultures e coli cells containing recombinant 16s rrna clone fish and activated sludge samples was performed according to the standard protocol for fish with rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes table 1 daims et al 2005 manz et al 1992 briefly probe solutions had a concentration of 5 pmol µl 1 and were applied at a ratio of 1 10 v v in hybridizaton buffer if applicable unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides table 1 were used in equimolar concentrations as the probes hybridizations were performed at 46 c for 2 hours after hybridization samples were washed in washing buffer for 10 min at 48 c and shortly dipped into ice cold milliq water all hybridized samples were also stained with dapi 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole for this purpose 10 µl of 10 mg ml dapi was spotted onto hybridized samples incubated for 5 min at room temperature and subsequently washed away by dipping samples in 96 v v ethanol samples were analysed immediately or stored at 20 c fluorescence micrographs of probe labelled cells were acquired using an inverted leica tcs sp8x confocal laser scanning microscope clsm the clsm was equipped with a uv 405 diode and a supercontinuum white light laser two photomultiplier pmt detectors three hybrid hyd detectors and the leica application suite af 3 2 1 9702 or leica application suite x 3 5 6 21594 the settings for excitation and emission wavelengths were adjusted to match the respective fluorochromes table 1 as described elsewhere for multicolor fish lukumbuzya et al 2019 the digital image analysis and visualization software daime version 2 2 daims et al 2006 was used to project 3d confocal z stacks to evaluate probe dissociation profiles β aob pure cultures or e coli cells for clone fish were hybridized to the respective probes with increasing concentrations of formamide 0 to 70 v v in the hybridization buffer and corresponding salt concentrations in the wash buffer manz et al 1992 if applicable competitor oligonucleotides table 1 were included images for inferring probe dissociation profiles were recorded using the same clsm settings for all parameters laser power confocal pinhole size and smart gain the probe dissociation profiles were determined based on the mean fluorescence intensities of the probe labelled cells by using the respective tool of the daime software the data were plotted in r and approximated probe dissociation curves were obtained by non linear regression with a sigmoidal model for the quantification of relative biovolume fractions activated sludge samples were hybridized to a β aob specific probe mix and to the eub338 i iii probe mix table 1 both labeled with different fluorochromes daims and wagner 2007 the two β aob specific probe mixtures used consisted of previously published or newly designed probes respectively table 1 in the old β aob probe mix all probes were labelled with cy3 and their fluorescence signals were recorded together in the same image in the new β aob probe mix the probes were labelled individually with different dyes and the recorded images of these fluorescence signals were merged in silico for quantifying the relative biovolume fractions of β aob ten to 40 pairs of images containing the specific probe or eub338 i iii probe signals respectively were acquired at random positions in a sample daims and wagner 2007 the clsm settings were adjusted so that cells in the specific probe images had the same size as their counterparts in the eub338 i iii images daims et al 2005 the respective tool of the daime software was used to measure the biovolume fractions of β aob based on these image pairs 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of existing fish probes targeting β aob most previous studies using fish to detect β aob in situ relied on a set of 16s rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes which were designed as long as 16 to 25 years ago this set consists of the probe nsm156 for various nitrosomonas spp neu for halophilic and halotolerant nitrosomonas spp cl6a192 for the nitrosomonas oligotropha lineage nmv for n mobilis ncom1025 for nitrosomonas communis nsv443 for the nitrosospira lineage and the two broad range probes nso190 and nso1225 for most β aob adamczyk et al 2003 juretschko 2000 juretschko et al 1998 mobarry et al 1996 wagner et al 1995 in the present study we matched the sequences of these probes against a recent 16s rrna gene sequence database see 2 1 which contained 505 non redundant full length sequences from cultured and uncultured β aob this in silico analysis revealed considerable gaps in the target group coverage for some of the probes whereas others still showed a surprisingly good coverage table 3 in particular the broad range probe nso1225 still covers the vast majority of β aob whereas probe nso190 originally also designed to target all β aob has a highly incomplete coverage according to current databases probe nsm156 which should target the genus nitrosomonas mobarry et al 1996 still covers a large fraction of this genus probe cl6a192 for the n oligotropha lineage cluster 6a covers only 50 of its target group table 3 furthermore unexpected hybridization patterns had previously been observed for the probes cl6a192 neu and ncom1025 although these probes target different lineages of β aob a large proportion of their signals overlapped in fish experiments with activated sludge gruber dorninger et al 2015 these observations are consistent with a lack of specificity of probes neu and ncom1025 which becomes apparent when non target β aob sequences with 1 2 weak nucleotide mismatches to the probes are taken into account table 3 such weak mismatches are often difficult to discriminate in fish without competitor oligonucleotides in this case probe neu potentially covers 30 of cluster 6a the target group of probe cl6a192 and would probably also bind to members of the n mobilis lineage within cluster 7 notably this unspecific hybridization of probe neu would not be prevented by the published competitor table 1 probe ncom1025 would also potentially detect the majority of the n mobilis lineage and could thus bind to the same organisms as probe neu table 3 in our study unspecific probe hybridization was confirmed in tests using biofilm and activated sludge samples from two bioreactors a sequencing batch biofilm reactor sbbr1 and the wwtp of klosterneuburg austria knb fig 1 a c table 2 moreover in one additional sludge from an industrial wwtp cp kelco table 2 the probe mix consisting of previously published aob probes table 1 detected numerous microbial cells that were arranged as tetrads within loose aggregates fig 2 a the morphology of these organisms was very dissimilar from the usual size and shape of the β aob cells and cell clusters which were also present in this sludge fig 2a moreover a test hybridization revealed that the tetrad shaped cells were also labelled by probe gam42a fig s1 suggesting that these organisms were gammaproteobacteria and unspecifically labelled by the previously published aob probes in summary the in silico evaluation and test hybridizations demonstrated that several of the previously published fish probes for β aob suffer from an insufficient target group coverage and specificity as a consequence further use of the affected probes for the in situ identification and quantification of the respective β aob groups should be performed with caution by taking into account their actual specificities table 3 3 2 design of a refined β aob cluster specific 16s rrna targeted oligonucleotide probe set based on 16s rrna and amoa gene phylogenies a subdivision of the β aob into distinct lineages clusters was suggested previously koops et al 2003 purkhold et al 2003 2000 stephen et al 1996 in that phylogenetic framework members of the genus nitrosospira belong to the clusters 0 to 4 whereas the remaining clusters 5 to 8 are formed by different lineages of the genus nitrosomonas purkhold et al 2000 two additional separate lineages were formed by nitrosomonas cryotolerans and the estuary isolate nitrosomonas sp nm143 purkhold et al 2003 2000 notably the obtained tree topologies did not support a clear separation of the nitrosospira and nitrosomonas genera instead the analyses indicated that the currently defined genus nitrosomonas is not monophyletic within the β aob purkhold et al 2003 2000 since the individual nitrosomonas clusters nevertheless represent stable lineages in bootstrap analyses purkhold et al 2003 and a thorough phylogenetic and taxonomic reevaluation of the β aob is still pending we retain the established nomenclature in this study using the β aob clusters as a framework we designed six new 16s rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes that are specific for nitrosomonas cluster 6 including both 6a with n oligotropha and n ureae and 6b with n marina and n aestuarii cluster 7 with n europaea n eutropha and n mobilis cluster 8 with n communis and n nitrosa the n cryotolerans cluster the n sp nm143 cluster and a new environmental cluster dk wwtp related to cluster 8 fig 3 in addition the old probe nsv443 which offered good coverage of the target clade but unsatisfactory target specificity was replaced with the new probe nsp441 for the genus nitrosospira comprising clusters 0 4 fig 3 for most of the new probes we designed competitor oligonucleotides that help discriminate non target organisms which possess only one or few weak base mismatches to the probe sequence in their 16s rrna these competitors were used as unlabeled oligonucleotides and in equimolar concentrations as the labeled probes in fish experiments details of the probes their target groups and the competitors are listed in table 1 according to an in silico analysis the new probes in combination with the designated competitors table 1 display a very good coverage and specificity for their target β aob clusters including cultured isolates as well as environmental sequences from uncultured β aob table 3 notably the newly designed probes with competitors also display a very high specificity with respect to non target matches outside of the β aob in silico evaluation based on the silva ssu nr release 138 and the arb probe match tool with 0 2 weighted mismatches as search criterion merely for probe nm 143 1010 less than ten non target betaproteobacterial sequences were found that are not covered by the competitor for this probe table 1 and probe nsp441 table 1 might hybridize with less than 60 non target betaproteobacteria mainly from the genera hydrogenophaga and gallionella however the number for nsp441 is low compared to the previously published probe nsv443 that would potentially detect more than 500 non target organisms considering that any environmental sample likely contains non target organisms which are not present in the current sequence databases we recommend to use the newly designed β aob cluster specific probes in combination with the broad range probe nso1225 table 3 labelled with a different fluorochrome cells detected by both probes should represent the targeted β aob lineage in order to identify the optimal hybridization stringency for each probe the dissociation profiles of the probes were determined by performing fish at increasing hybridization and washing stringencies manz et al 1992 where possible pure culture cells of the target β aob were used in these experiments as isolates of n cryotolerans n sp nm143 and the uncultured cluster dk wwtp were not available their 16s rrna genes were heterologously expressed in e coli schramm et al 2002 to determine the dissociation profiles of the respective probes for all probes we obtained sigmoid dissociation profiles that were suitable to identify the highest stringency which still yields bright fluorescence signals with the target organisms fig s2 and s3 table 1 probes that need different hybridization stringencies can be used in the same experiment by performing the most stringent hybridization and washing steps first and then the other steps in order of decreasing stringency e g daims et al 2005 all probes were also hybridized to non target β aob cells or the respective recombinant e coli cells to test for unspecific hybridization in these experiments no fluorescence signal was observed for any probe at the optimal stringency and in the presence of the competitor oligonucleotides fig s4 3 3 detection and quantification of β aob in activated sludge the applicability of the new probe set was tested in fish experiments with nitrifying activated sludge samples from different wwtps in austria germany and denmark table 2 in particular the newly designed probes targeting nitrosomonas cluster 6 nm ol 703 and cluster 7 nm eu 136 were applied to the same sludge samples that we had already used to confirm the cross hybridization of the previously published probes cl6a192 neu and ncom1025 fig 1 with the two new probes no overlapping fluorescence signals were observed and the hybridization patterns appeared to be completely consistent fig 1b d this result is in agreement with the in silico analysis which predicted that probes nm ol 703 and nm eu 136 do not target the same sequences in the database table 3 furthermore when the new aob probe mix table 1 was used to detect β aob in the sludge from cp kelco the conspicuous tetrad shaped cells detected by the old aob probe mix were not labelled anymore instead the new probe mix detected exclusively cells and cell clusters that displayed the typical morphology of β aob which has been observed in numerous studies of nitrifiers in wwtps and isolated β aob e g daims et al 2001 juretschko et al 1998 koops and pommerening röser 2001 fig 2b the new probe nm ni 1026 which targets the novel uncultured lineage dk wwtp fig 3 was applied to activated sludge from wwtp esbjerg east where it showed specific signals with a morphology similar to that typically portrayed by β aob fig 4 we did not have access to environmental samples that were suitable for fish and contained the target β aob of the new probes nm cr 998 nm 143 1010 nm co 1457 and nsp441 however these probes were successfully evaluated using pure β aob cultures or clone fish in addition they did not unspecifically detect other bacterial populations in activated sludge or biofilm fig 1 for nm co 1457 fig s5 for nm cr 998 nm 143 1010 and nsp441 under the assumption that those probes which could only be tested by clone fish will also bind to the native ribosomes of their target organisms all probes should be suitable for fish analyses of environmental aob communities a quantitative comparison of the old and new aob probe mixes table 1 was carried out with activated sludge samples from seven wwtps table 4 for six of these sludge samples highly similar biovolume fractions of β aob were measured by quantitative fish with either probe set table 4 only for the cp kelco sludge we obtained a much lower biovolume fraction of β aob with the newly designed probe set than with the previously published probes table 4 this difference is most likely explained by the better specificity of the newly designed probes which did not stain the abundant tetrad shaped cells in this sludge fig 2 for all samples and experiments high congruency values 90 were obtained table 4 this value indicates that the fluorescence signals in the β aob probe mix images occupied almost exactly the same area as their counterparts in the general bacterial probe eub338 i iii images thus the β aob probes did not detect large amounts of non bacterial cells and did not bind excessively to non microbial particles in the samples for the five danish wwtps the results of quantitative fish gained independent support from similarly low relative abundances of β aob in bacterial 16s rrna gene amplicon datasets table 4 our results confirm that the new β aob probe mix table 1 is suitable to detect and quantify β aob in wwtps and importantly the data for cp kelco show that the new mix also offers a better specificity for β aob than the previously published probes fig 2 fig s1 4 conclusion the newly designed 16s rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes offer a similar or better coverage of different β aob lineages than the established probes table 3 and they do not show the unspecific hybridization patterns that were observed for some of the previously designed probes when applied to complex microbial communities figs 1 and 2 however they are not designed to completely replace the established fish probes for β aob for example probes nso1225 and nsm156 still offer an excellent coverage of their target groups table 3 which is why no new broad range probe for β aob was designed in this study instead the new probes can be applied in combination with selected previously published probes to achieve the currently best possible total coverage of β aob and to identify specific β aob lineages with a high confidence by fish hence the new probe set will facilitate future studies of β aob community composition and population dynamics it will also enable specific analyses of the spatial localization of members of the different β aob lineages in flocs and biofilms such spatial analyses can reveal potential niche differentiation and symbiotic interactions with other microorganisms but were previously hampered by unspecific hybridization patterns of some of the old probes although we used only activated sludge and biofilm samples from wwtps to test the probes in this study the new probe set can likely also be applied to other types of samples that are suitable for rrna targeted fish in summary the new probes will improve virtually all spatial and functional analyses of β aob that use fish to gain insights which can only be obtained by in situ approaches declaration of competing interest the authors

17553,ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob of the betaproteobacterial genera nitrosomonas and nitrosospira are key nitrifying microorganisms in many natural and engineered ecosystems since many aob remain uncultured fluorescence in situ hybridization fish with rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes has been one of the most widely used approaches to study the community composition abundance and other features of aob directly in environmental samples however the established and widely used aob specific 16s rrna targeted fish probes were designed up to two decades ago based on much smaller rrna gene sequence datasets than available today several of these probes cover their target aob lineages incompletely and suffer from a weak target specificity which causes cross hybridization of probes that should detect different aob lineages here a set of new highly specific 16s rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes was developed and experimentally evaluated that complements the existing probes and enables the specific detection and differentiation of the known major phylogenetic clusters of betaproteobacterial aob the new probes were successfully applied to visualize and quantify aob in activated sludge and biofilm samples from seven pilot and full scale wastewater treatment systems based on its improved target group coverage and specificity the refined probe set will facilitate future in situ analyses of aob graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fluorescence in situ hybridization ammonia oxidizing bacteria nitrification wastewater treatment plants oligonucleotide probes 1 introduction nitrification a key process in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle is the microbially mediated oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and subsequently to nitrate for many decades nitrification was perceived as a process always performed by two functional groups of aerobic chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms in cooperation the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and archaea aoa which oxidize ammonia to nitrite and the nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob that oxidize nitrite to nitrate bock and wagner 2001 daims et al 2016 könneke et al 2005 only recently complete ammonia oxidizers comammox organisms have been discovered which carry out the entire nitrification process alone daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 currently all known canonical aob oxidizing ammonia to nitrite belong to one of two phylogenetic lineages within the proteobacteria gammaproteobacterial aob include the genus nitrosococcus which is halophilic and occurs in marine habitats and salt lakes campbell et al 2011 and the genus nitrosoglobus which contains acidotolerant aob from acidic soils hayatsu et al 2017 in contrast the aob that usually dominate in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems belong to the family nitrosomonadaceae within the now obsolete parks et al 2018 taxonomic class of betaproteobacteria prosser et al 2014 here we refer to these organisms as β aob all cultivated and described members of the family nitrosomonadaceae are chemolithoautotrophic aob from the genera nitrosomonas and nitrosospira prosser et al 2014 representatives of β aob are found in almost all oxic environments but are particularly successful in nutrient rich habitats such as fertilized soils or eutrophic freshwater sediments and also the majority of wastewater treatment plants wwtps bollmann et al 2014 di et al 2010 fan et al 2011 verhamme et al 2011 the low abundance of aoa in activated sludge from most municipal wwtps gao et al 2013 mußmann et al 2011 wells et al 2009 has recently been attributed to their sensitivity to copper limitation caused by chemical complexation of copper by organic compounds gwak et al 2019 this effect likely contributes to the commonly observed predominance of β aob in these engineered environments despite their ubiquity β aob have proven to be exceptionally fastidious and recalcitrant to cultivation hence the number of β aob isolates with standing in nomenclature parte 2014 remains low n 14 despite their broad environmental distribution and high ecological significance to overcome this problem researchers use cultivation independent molecular techniques for studying various aspects of aob diversity and ecophysiology one of the most commonly applied molecular methods is rrna targeted fluorescence in situ hybridization fish this approach uses rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes which are covalently linked to fluorescent dyes and hybridize to the ribosomal rna of specific microbial populations amann et al 1995 delong et al 1989 the resulting fluorescence signal allows the in situ detection and visualization of target organisms in environmental samples fish has numerous applications in microbial ecology which include the in situ abundance quantification of populations daims and wagner 2007 wagner et al 1994 and quantitative analyses of the spatial distribution of microorganisms in biofilms and other structurally complex samples almstrand et al 2013 daims et al 2006 dolinšek et al 2013 schillinger et al 2012 welch et al 2016 combinations of fish with chemical imaging techniques like microautoradiography lee et al 1999 raman microspectroscopy fernando et al 2019 huang et al 2007 and nanometer scale secondary ion mass spectroscopy nanosims berry et al 2013 musat et al 2012 even permit cultivation independent physiological studies of discrete microbial populations fish can also be used together with bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging boncat which is another powerful approach to detect metabolically active microorganisms in situ hatzenpichler et al 2014 fish has been applied since 1995 wagner et al 1995 in numerous studies to investigate β aob in aquatic systems especially wwtps and has proven to be of immense value in this context for example nitrosomonas formerly nitrosococcus mobilis was identified as the dominant aob in an industrial wwtp juretschko et al 1998 and later isolated from activated sludge by fish assisted screening and propagation of sorted microcolonies fujitani et al 2015 fish and image analysis were used to quantify the spatial localization patterns of β aob in nitrifying biofilms almstrand et al 2013 gruber dorninger et al 2015 maixner et al 2006 by combining fish detection with microsensor measurements of substrate concentration gradients both the distribution and activities of β aob in biofilms were studied okabe et al 1999 schramm et al 1998 application of this approach to calculate volumetric reaction rates even revealed the in situ whole cell kinetics of uncultured β aob nitrosospira spp schramm et al 1999 in another study fish and quantitative pcr qpcr were used to detect β aob in granular activated sludge these data were the basis for two ecophysiological models which address the observed and unexpected higher in situ abundances of nob over aob in the granules winkler et al 2012 fish was also used to quantify the abundance dynamics of diverse β aob and anaerobic ammonium oxidizers anammox in ammonium or urea fed enrichments revealing different substrate preferences of the populations sliekers et al 2004 and to analyze the spatial organization of β aob and anammox organisms in nitrogen removing biofilms pynaert et al 2003 since the validation of methods is crucial a recent comparison of fish and qpcr as tools to quantify the abundance of β aob deserves attention it revealed that fish and amoa targeted qpcr yielded consistent results whereas qpcr of 16s rrna genes underestimated the abundance of β aob baptista et al 2014 these and many other studies used a well established set of rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes to detect all β aob or their sublineages by fish adamczyk et al 2003 juretschko et al 2002 1998 mobarry et al 1996 wagner et al 1995 however the most commonly used probes were designed based on a much more limited set of 16s rrna sequences from β aob than is available now and they do not cover the entire diversity of β aob represented in current databases moreover inconsistent in situ hybridization patterns were observed which suggested that some of these probes hybridize to β aob outside the expected target groups gruber dorninger et al 2015 an incomplete probe coverage and weak specificity can introduce a significant bias in studies that rely on these probes to detect and quantify β aob and to distinguish different β aob lineages hence an updated set of β aob specific fish probes is urgently needed here we introduce new β aob specific rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes which complement and refine the existing probe set and enable the identification visualization and quantification of all currently known β aob lineages following probe design and evaluation the specificity and applicability of the new probes were tested with activated sludge and biofilm samples from municipal and industrial wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 in silico design of 16s rrna targeted probes and phylogenetic analyses the new rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes table 1 were designed using the probe design and probe match functions of the arb software package version 6 0 6 ludwig et al 2004 and the silva ref nr99 release 132 ssu rrna sequence database quast et al 2013 the database was amended with 46 additional full length 16s rrna gene sequences of β aob from full scale wwtps in denmark dueholm et al 2020 which were retrieved from the midas database mcilroy et al 2015 nierychlo et al 2020 the probe match tool of arb was also used to evaluate the target group coverage and specificity of the previously published and the new fish probes for β aob these analyses and the probe specificity checks outside of the β aob used silva ref nr99 release 138 amended with the 46 sequences from midas see above a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was calculated based on an alignment sina aligner pruesse et al 2012 of 505 reference sequences of β aob from the aforementioned databases using w iq tree trifinopoulos et al 2016 with 1000 bootstrap iterations a previous phylogenetic study had found that different treeing methods including maximum likelihood yielded consistent tree topologies at the level of the major β aob lineages and with the 16s rrna gene as marker purkhold et al 2003 tim3e g4 was determined by modelfinder to be the best fitting base substitution model for the calculation kalyaanamoorthy et al 2017 the resulting tree was visualized with itol letunic and bork 2019 bacterial 16s rrna amplicon sequence data v1 3 region from 88 samples from the five danish wastewater treatment plants table 2 were retrieved from the midas database mcilroy et al 2015 and used to determine the mean amplicon abundances of β aob classified as nitrosomonas and nitrosospira amplicon reads were dereplicated and formatted for use in the usearch unoise workflow edgar 2016a dereplicated reads were used to generate amplicon sequence variants using the usearch version 10 unoise3 tool with default settings taxonomy was assigned using the sintax classifier edgar 2016b in usearch version 11 using the silva release 138 taxonomy the results were analyzed in r r core team 2016 using the ampvis2 r package 2 5 https github com madsalbertsen ampvis2 2 2 cultivation and fixation of β aob pure cultures pure cultures of the β aob nitrosospira briensis nsp1 nitrosospira multiformis ni13 nitrosomonas europaea nm50 nitrosomonas eutropha nm57 nitrosomonas oligotropha nm75 and nitrosomonas sp nm51 an unnamed species from the nitrosomonas marina lineage were grown as described earlier koops et al 1991 nitrosomonas communis nm2 was grown in a modified aob medium according to zhou et al 2019 all cultures were harvested 40 ml during the logarithmic growth phase and centrifuged 4000 g room temperature 20 min to collect the biomass the supernatant was removed and the cell pellets were resuspended in a 3 w v formaldehyde solution for fixation 1 h at room temperature as detailed elsewhere daims et al 2005 the fixed cultures were washed twice in a 1 pbs phosphate buffered saline solution centrifuged 12 000 g at room temperature for 8 min and then resuspended in a 1 1 mixture of 1 pbs and 96 v v ethanol and stored at 20 c until further processing daims et al 2005 2 3 sampling and fixation of activated sludge activated sludge or biofilm detached suspended particles samples taken at several wwtps in austria germany and denmark were analyzed table 2 the samples were centrifuged 20 817 g 4 c 15 min the supernatant was removed and the sludge was resuspended in a 2 v v samples from sbbr1 knb and ing or 4 v v all other samples formaldehyde solution for fixation 3 h 4 c lukumbuzya et al 2019 nielsen 2009 the sludge samples were subsequently washed twice in 1 pbs resuspended in a 1 1 mixture of 1 pbs and 96 v v ethanol and stored at 20 c until further processing 2 4 recombinant 16s rrna expression for clone fish we could not obtain cells of the isolates nitrosomonas cryotolerans targeted by the new probe nm cr 998 and nitrosomonas sp nm143 targeted by probe nm 143 1010 table 1 furthermore no isolate is available from a nitrosomonas communis related cluster detected in some wwtps in denmark table 2 for which we designed the new probe nm ni 1026 table 1 in order to evaluate the new probes that are specific for these β aob and their close relatives the respective 16s rrna was heterologously expressed in e coli for clone fish schramm et al 2002 briefly synthetic strings dna fragments thermofisher scientific of full length 16s rrna genes were cloned into e coli novablue competent cells using the novagen petblue 1 perfectly blunt cloning kit merck the e coli cells were grown to an od of 0 3 0 4 1 mm of iptg was added to the cultures and the cells were incubated 1 h 200 r p m 37 c subsequently chloramphenicol 170 mg l l was added to increase the intracellular accumulation of rna including the heterologously expressed 16s rrna schramm et al 2002 and the cells were incubated at 4 c for 4 hours finally the cells were fixed in formaldehyde as described above for the β aob isolates 2 5 fluorescence in situ hybridization microscopy and digital image analysis fish of all β aob pure cultures e coli cells containing recombinant 16s rrna clone fish and activated sludge samples was performed according to the standard protocol for fish with rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes table 1 daims et al 2005 manz et al 1992 briefly probe solutions had a concentration of 5 pmol µl 1 and were applied at a ratio of 1 10 v v in hybridizaton buffer if applicable unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides table 1 were used in equimolar concentrations as the probes hybridizations were performed at 46 c for 2 hours after hybridization samples were washed in washing buffer for 10 min at 48 c and shortly dipped into ice cold milliq water all hybridized samples were also stained with dapi 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole for this purpose 10 µl of 10 mg ml dapi was spotted onto hybridized samples incubated for 5 min at room temperature and subsequently washed away by dipping samples in 96 v v ethanol samples were analysed immediately or stored at 20 c fluorescence micrographs of probe labelled cells were acquired using an inverted leica tcs sp8x confocal laser scanning microscope clsm the clsm was equipped with a uv 405 diode and a supercontinuum white light laser two photomultiplier pmt detectors three hybrid hyd detectors and the leica application suite af 3 2 1 9702 or leica application suite x 3 5 6 21594 the settings for excitation and emission wavelengths were adjusted to match the respective fluorochromes table 1 as described elsewhere for multicolor fish lukumbuzya et al 2019 the digital image analysis and visualization software daime version 2 2 daims et al 2006 was used to project 3d confocal z stacks to evaluate probe dissociation profiles β aob pure cultures or e coli cells for clone fish were hybridized to the respective probes with increasing concentrations of formamide 0 to 70 v v in the hybridization buffer and corresponding salt concentrations in the wash buffer manz et al 1992 if applicable competitor oligonucleotides table 1 were included images for inferring probe dissociation profiles were recorded using the same clsm settings for all parameters laser power confocal pinhole size and smart gain the probe dissociation profiles were determined based on the mean fluorescence intensities of the probe labelled cells by using the respective tool of the daime software the data were plotted in r and approximated probe dissociation curves were obtained by non linear regression with a sigmoidal model for the quantification of relative biovolume fractions activated sludge samples were hybridized to a β aob specific probe mix and to the eub338 i iii probe mix table 1 both labeled with different fluorochromes daims and wagner 2007 the two β aob specific probe mixtures used consisted of previously published or newly designed probes respectively table 1 in the old β aob probe mix all probes were labelled with cy3 and their fluorescence signals were recorded together in the same image in the new β aob probe mix the probes were labelled individually with different dyes and the recorded images of these fluorescence signals were merged in silico for quantifying the relative biovolume fractions of β aob ten to 40 pairs of images containing the specific probe or eub338 i iii probe signals respectively were acquired at random positions in a sample daims and wagner 2007 the clsm settings were adjusted so that cells in the specific probe images had the same size as their counterparts in the eub338 i iii images daims et al 2005 the respective tool of the daime software was used to measure the biovolume fractions of β aob based on these image pairs 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of existing fish probes targeting β aob most previous studies using fish to detect β aob in situ relied on a set of 16s rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes which were designed as long as 16 to 25 years ago this set consists of the probe nsm156 for various nitrosomonas spp neu for halophilic and halotolerant nitrosomonas spp cl6a192 for the nitrosomonas oligotropha lineage nmv for n mobilis ncom1025 for nitrosomonas communis nsv443 for the nitrosospira lineage and the two broad range probes nso190 and nso1225 for most β aob adamczyk et al 2003 juretschko 2000 juretschko et al 1998 mobarry et al 1996 wagner et al 1995 in the present study we matched the sequences of these probes against a recent 16s rrna gene sequence database see 2 1 which contained 505 non redundant full length sequences from cultured and uncultured β aob this in silico analysis revealed considerable gaps in the target group coverage for some of the probes whereas others still showed a surprisingly good coverage table 3 in particular the broad range probe nso1225 still covers the vast majority of β aob whereas probe nso190 originally also designed to target all β aob has a highly incomplete coverage according to current databases probe nsm156 which should target the genus nitrosomonas mobarry et al 1996 still covers a large fraction of this genus probe cl6a192 for the n oligotropha lineage cluster 6a covers only 50 of its target group table 3 furthermore unexpected hybridization patterns had previously been observed for the probes cl6a192 neu and ncom1025 although these probes target different lineages of β aob a large proportion of their signals overlapped in fish experiments with activated sludge gruber dorninger et al 2015 these observations are consistent with a lack of specificity of probes neu and ncom1025 which becomes apparent when non target β aob sequences with 1 2 weak nucleotide mismatches to the probes are taken into account table 3 such weak mismatches are often difficult to discriminate in fish without competitor oligonucleotides in this case probe neu potentially covers 30 of cluster 6a the target group of probe cl6a192 and would probably also bind to members of the n mobilis lineage within cluster 7 notably this unspecific hybridization of probe neu would not be prevented by the published competitor table 1 probe ncom1025 would also potentially detect the majority of the n mobilis lineage and could thus bind to the same organisms as probe neu table 3 in our study unspecific probe hybridization was confirmed in tests using biofilm and activated sludge samples from two bioreactors a sequencing batch biofilm reactor sbbr1 and the wwtp of klosterneuburg austria knb fig 1 a c table 2 moreover in one additional sludge from an industrial wwtp cp kelco table 2 the probe mix consisting of previously published aob probes table 1 detected numerous microbial cells that were arranged as tetrads within loose aggregates fig 2 a the morphology of these organisms was very dissimilar from the usual size and shape of the β aob cells and cell clusters which were also present in this sludge fig 2a moreover a test hybridization revealed that the tetrad shaped cells were also labelled by probe gam42a fig s1 suggesting that these organisms were gammaproteobacteria and unspecifically labelled by the previously published aob probes in summary the in silico evaluation and test hybridizations demonstrated that several of the previously published fish probes for β aob suffer from an insufficient target group coverage and specificity as a consequence further use of the affected probes for the in situ identification and quantification of the respective β aob groups should be performed with caution by taking into account their actual specificities table 3 3 2 design of a refined β aob cluster specific 16s rrna targeted oligonucleotide probe set based on 16s rrna and amoa gene phylogenies a subdivision of the β aob into distinct lineages clusters was suggested previously koops et al 2003 purkhold et al 2003 2000 stephen et al 1996 in that phylogenetic framework members of the genus nitrosospira belong to the clusters 0 to 4 whereas the remaining clusters 5 to 8 are formed by different lineages of the genus nitrosomonas purkhold et al 2000 two additional separate lineages were formed by nitrosomonas cryotolerans and the estuary isolate nitrosomonas sp nm143 purkhold et al 2003 2000 notably the obtained tree topologies did not support a clear separation of the nitrosospira and nitrosomonas genera instead the analyses indicated that the currently defined genus nitrosomonas is not monophyletic within the β aob purkhold et al 2003 2000 since the individual nitrosomonas clusters nevertheless represent stable lineages in bootstrap analyses purkhold et al 2003 and a thorough phylogenetic and taxonomic reevaluation of the β aob is still pending we retain the established nomenclature in this study using the β aob clusters as a framework we designed six new 16s rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes that are specific for nitrosomonas cluster 6 including both 6a with n oligotropha and n ureae and 6b with n marina and n aestuarii cluster 7 with n europaea n eutropha and n mobilis cluster 8 with n communis and n nitrosa the n cryotolerans cluster the n sp nm143 cluster and a new environmental cluster dk wwtp related to cluster 8 fig 3 in addition the old probe nsv443 which offered good coverage of the target clade but unsatisfactory target specificity was replaced with the new probe nsp441 for the genus nitrosospira comprising clusters 0 4 fig 3 for most of the new probes we designed competitor oligonucleotides that help discriminate non target organisms which possess only one or few weak base mismatches to the probe sequence in their 16s rrna these competitors were used as unlabeled oligonucleotides and in equimolar concentrations as the labeled probes in fish experiments details of the probes their target groups and the competitors are listed in table 1 according to an in silico analysis the new probes in combination with the designated competitors table 1 display a very good coverage and specificity for their target β aob clusters including cultured isolates as well as environmental sequences from uncultured β aob table 3 notably the newly designed probes with competitors also display a very high specificity with respect to non target matches outside of the β aob in silico evaluation based on the silva ssu nr release 138 and the arb probe match tool with 0 2 weighted mismatches as search criterion merely for probe nm 143 1010 less than ten non target betaproteobacterial sequences were found that are not covered by the competitor for this probe table 1 and probe nsp441 table 1 might hybridize with less than 60 non target betaproteobacteria mainly from the genera hydrogenophaga and gallionella however the number for nsp441 is low compared to the previously published probe nsv443 that would potentially detect more than 500 non target organisms considering that any environmental sample likely contains non target organisms which are not present in the current sequence databases we recommend to use the newly designed β aob cluster specific probes in combination with the broad range probe nso1225 table 3 labelled with a different fluorochrome cells detected by both probes should represent the targeted β aob lineage in order to identify the optimal hybridization stringency for each probe the dissociation profiles of the probes were determined by performing fish at increasing hybridization and washing stringencies manz et al 1992 where possible pure culture cells of the target β aob were used in these experiments as isolates of n cryotolerans n sp nm143 and the uncultured cluster dk wwtp were not available their 16s rrna genes were heterologously expressed in e coli schramm et al 2002 to determine the dissociation profiles of the respective probes for all probes we obtained sigmoid dissociation profiles that were suitable to identify the highest stringency which still yields bright fluorescence signals with the target organisms fig s2 and s3 table 1 probes that need different hybridization stringencies can be used in the same experiment by performing the most stringent hybridization and washing steps first and then the other steps in order of decreasing stringency e g daims et al 2005 all probes were also hybridized to non target β aob cells or the respective recombinant e coli cells to test for unspecific hybridization in these experiments no fluorescence signal was observed for any probe at the optimal stringency and in the presence of the competitor oligonucleotides fig s4 3 3 detection and quantification of β aob in activated sludge the applicability of the new probe set was tested in fish experiments with nitrifying activated sludge samples from different wwtps in austria germany and denmark table 2 in particular the newly designed probes targeting nitrosomonas cluster 6 nm ol 703 and cluster 7 nm eu 136 were applied to the same sludge samples that we had already used to confirm the cross hybridization of the previously published probes cl6a192 neu and ncom1025 fig 1 with the two new probes no overlapping fluorescence signals were observed and the hybridization patterns appeared to be completely consistent fig 1b d this result is in agreement with the in silico analysis which predicted that probes nm ol 703 and nm eu 136 do not target the same sequences in the database table 3 furthermore when the new aob probe mix table 1 was used to detect β aob in the sludge from cp kelco the conspicuous tetrad shaped cells detected by the old aob probe mix were not labelled anymore instead the new probe mix detected exclusively cells and cell clusters that displayed the typical morphology of β aob which has been observed in numerous studies of nitrifiers in wwtps and isolated β aob e g daims et al 2001 juretschko et al 1998 koops and pommerening röser 2001 fig 2b the new probe nm ni 1026 which targets the novel uncultured lineage dk wwtp fig 3 was applied to activated sludge from wwtp esbjerg east where it showed specific signals with a morphology similar to that typically portrayed by β aob fig 4 we did not have access to environmental samples that were suitable for fish and contained the target β aob of the new probes nm cr 998 nm 143 1010 nm co 1457 and nsp441 however these probes were successfully evaluated using pure β aob cultures or clone fish in addition they did not unspecifically detect other bacterial populations in activated sludge or biofilm fig 1 for nm co 1457 fig s5 for nm cr 998 nm 143 1010 and nsp441 under the assumption that those probes which could only be tested by clone fish will also bind to the native ribosomes of their target organisms all probes should be suitable for fish analyses of environmental aob communities a quantitative comparison of the old and new aob probe mixes table 1 was carried out with activated sludge samples from seven wwtps table 4 for six of these sludge samples highly similar biovolume fractions of β aob were measured by quantitative fish with either probe set table 4 only for the cp kelco sludge we obtained a much lower biovolume fraction of β aob with the newly designed probe set than with the previously published probes table 4 this difference is most likely explained by the better specificity of the newly designed probes which did not stain the abundant tetrad shaped cells in this sludge fig 2 for all samples and experiments high congruency values 90 were obtained table 4 this value indicates that the fluorescence signals in the β aob probe mix images occupied almost exactly the same area as their counterparts in the general bacterial probe eub338 i iii images thus the β aob probes did not detect large amounts of non bacterial cells and did not bind excessively to non microbial particles in the samples for the five danish wwtps the results of quantitative fish gained independent support from similarly low relative abundances of β aob in bacterial 16s rrna gene amplicon datasets table 4 our results confirm that the new β aob probe mix table 1 is suitable to detect and quantify β aob in wwtps and importantly the data for cp kelco show that the new mix also offers a better specificity for β aob than the previously published probes fig 2 fig s1 4 conclusion the newly designed 16s rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes offer a similar or better coverage of different β aob lineages than the established probes table 3 and they do not show the unspecific hybridization patterns that were observed for some of the previously designed probes when applied to complex microbial communities figs 1 and 2 however they are not designed to completely replace the established fish probes for β aob for example probes nso1225 and nsm156 still offer an excellent coverage of their target groups table 3 which is why no new broad range probe for β aob was designed in this study instead the new probes can be applied in combination with selected previously published probes to achieve the currently best possible total coverage of β aob and to identify specific β aob lineages with a high confidence by fish hence the new probe set will facilitate future studies of β aob community composition and population dynamics it will also enable specific analyses of the spatial localization of members of the different β aob lineages in flocs and biofilms such spatial analyses can reveal potential niche differentiation and symbiotic interactions with other microorganisms but were previously hampered by unspecific hybridization patterns of some of the old probes although we used only activated sludge and biofilm samples from wwtps to test the probes in this study the new probe set can likely also be applied to other types of samples that are suitable for rrna targeted fish in summary the new probes will improve virtually all spatial and functional analyses of β aob that use fish to gain insights which can only be obtained by in situ approaches declaration of competing interest the authors

17554,submerged macrophyte restoration is the key stage in the reestablishment of an aquatic ecosystem previous studies have paid considerable attention to the effect of multiple environmental factors on submerged macrophytes meanwhile few studies have been conducted regarding the spatial and seasonal characteristics of water and sediment properties and their long term relationship with submerged macrophytes after the implementation of the submerged macrophytes restoration project on a monthly basis we monitored the spatial and seasonal variation in water parameters sediment properties and the submerged macrophyte characteristics of west lake in hangzhou from august 2013 to july 2019 from these measurements we characterized the relationship between environmental factors and submerged macrophytes water nutrient concentrations continuously decreased with time and the accumulation of sediment nutrients was accelerated as the submerged macrophyte communities developed on a long term scale the results indicated that the difference in water parameters was due to seasonal changes and land use types in the watershed the differences in the sediment properties were mainly attributed to seasonal changes and changes in the flow field redundancy analysis showed that the influence of water nutrients on the submerged macrophyte distribution was greater than that of sediment nutrients the result also suggested that the developed root system high stoichiometric homeostasis coefficients of p and compensation ability of substantial leaf tissue may lead to a large distribution of vallisneria natans in west lake in hangzhou the correlation of water parameters and sediment properties with submerged macrophytes for a long time was very important as the restoration was achieved to ensure the stability of the aquatic ecosystem after performing the submerged macrophyte restoration a greater emphasis must be placed on reestablishing the entire ecosystem including the restoration of aquatic animals and fish stocks we expect these findings to serve as a reference for researchers and government agencies in the field of aquatic ecosystem restoration graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water and sediment properties submerged macrophyte distribution spatial and seasonal variation redundancy analysis west lake in hangzhou 1 introduction human activity has influenced the water status on the surface of earth resulting in water eutrophication which is characterized by nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants conley et al 2009 schindler et al 2008 with the increase in the loading of nitrogen and phosphorus due to industrial emissions agricultural fertilization and domestic resources many shallow lakes have realized toxic algal blooms which leads to the global decline of aquatic biodiversity blindow 1992 and ecological function smith and schindler 2009 vitousek et al 2002 with a worse scenario occurring in developing countries vass et al 2015 wu et al 2006 transforming from being dominated by submerged macrophytes these shallow lakes may exhibit an alternative stable state characterized by turbid phytoplankton overgrowth because of the increasing input of nutrients scheffer 1989 to reverse the emergence of phytoplankton dominated lakes returning to lakes dominated by submerged macrophytes simultaneously achieving positive circulation and self regulation is important many studies have indicated that submerged macrophytes play an important role in ecological restoration owing to their ecological function which includes controlling sediments resuspension rolland et al 2015 facilitating nutrient uptake from the surrounding environment granéli and solander 1988 and providing a habitat and food for aquatic animals engelhardt and ritchie 2001 wood et al 2017 submerged phytoremediation technology has been widely accepted by researchers and government departments to improve water quality and aquatic ecosystems therefore more governmental agencies globally have carried out many large scale submerged macrophyte restoration projects birk et al 2012 song et al 2018 that attempt to enhance water quality promote species diversity and relax the influence of anthropogenic eutrophication on the aquatic system the goal of these projects is to interrupt the turbid phytoplankton overgrowth and the stable water status transforming the aquatic system into clean water status however the frequently dynamic variation of submerged macrophyte and phytoplankton in composition and abundance in shallow lakes should be got more concerns for sustaining lake functioning and stability sayer et al 2009 sayer et al 2010 phytoplankton biomass was associated with water nutrients and zooplankton in seasonal variation lau and lane 2002a with present of the low level submerged macrophyte coverage only water nutrients limitation while nutrients and zooplankton which both limiting phytoplankton biomass in macrophyte free shallow lakes lau and lane 2002b the ecological niche of aquatic macrophytes is defined by sediment properties and the conditions of the surrounding medium and water vukov et al 2017 owing to severe influence of the terrestrial elements of the associated watershed lacoul and freedman 2006 these factors can represent the environmental status of the water system and reflect historical human activity edwards et al 2000 physical and chemical characteristics of both the water column and sediment may explain the variation in submerged macrophytes boedeltje et al 2001 compared with phytoplankton submerged macrophyte growth was more dependent on the sediment nutrient source whereby sediments may supply nutrients when the open water nutrient level was reduced the growth distribution and species composition of the macrophyte vegetation was more closely related to the current velocity and water depth than the chemical factors in the river or stream owing to anthropic impact steffen et al 2014 and also the physical and chemical properties of the sediment including density ph and total nitrogen tn antunes et al 2012 due to overdevelopment of lake basins and excessive pollutants inputs guo 2007 any alteration of submerged macrophytes community could have a large effect on the ecosystem processes and functions alexander et al 2008 beck et al 2010 the interaction among water parameters sediment properties and submerged macrophytes plays a vital role in regulating ecosystem structure and maintaining the water quality level scheffer et al 2001 bornette et al 2011 stable clear water level and the diverse submerged macrophytes community only could appear through a long term restoration after the reduction of external nutrient load hilt et al 2018 although several investigations have focused on the impacts of environmental conditions including water quality parameters sediment properties and nutrient content on submerged macrophytes in large shallow lakes pan et al 2011 rodrigo et al 2013 few studies have established the spatial and temporal variability of water column quality sediment properties and species composition of the submerged macrophytes over the long term detailed monitoring of the environment surrounding aquatic systems over a long period of time may provide further evidence to explain the observed pattern in this study we investigated the overlying water quality properties of sediments and submerged macrophyte characteristics continuously over a 6 years period 2013 2019 in west lake in hangzhou our goals were the following 1 understand the variation in water quality sediment properties and submerged macrophyte characteristics at long time scales 2 understand the spatial and seasonal variation of water parameters sediment properties and submerged macrophyte distribution after ecological restoration efforts 3 determine the main environmental factors that influence submerged macrophytes and 4 investigate the reasons for the extent of the submerged macrophyte community and the dominant species in west lake in hangzhou the results of this study are expected to provide theoretical guidance for the management and maintenance of submerged plants in west lake in hangzhou and similar lakes after restoration 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design and field sampling west lake 120 12 58 16 27 e 30 22 73 25 97 n is located in zhejiang province in western china a typically urban shallow lake which is still faces eutrophication problems because of the factors such as small storage capacity long hydraulic retention time and the excessively anthropogenic and natural nutrient inputs in the past few decades lin et al 2020 pei and wang 2003 song et al 2003 it has been classified as a world heritage site in 2011 the lake is recognized as a typical shallow and eutrophic lake with a surface water area of 6 5 km2 and a mean depth of 2 27 m zhang et al 2016b longhongjian stream and chishanxi stream were two important sources of west lake containing the two streams mainstream and tributary which originates from longjing spring and yuegui mountain respectively longhongjian stream pour into west lake at the west side of its sublake maojiabu mixed evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forest accounts for approximately 70 20 by tea plantation and 10 by residential transportation area and water body of total watershed area of longhongjian stream han et al 2018 compared to chishanxi stream the watershed of longhongjian stream has more drainage area of forest land and tea plantation however wuguitan and xiaonanhu only have watershed area of forest and residential area fig 1 longhongjian stream watershed of tea plantation and forest areas contributed to a dominated proportion of the tn export into west lake han et al 2018 the watershed of five sublakes can be classified into combined forest residential and large scale tea plantation land maojiabu combined forest residential and small scale tea plantation land yuhuwan and only combined forest and residential land wuguitan xilihu and xiaonanhu in addition water quality of the two streams into west lake was improved because of watershed management water tn no3 n and tp of longhongjian stream in 2013 and 2019 were 8 10 mgl 1 7 25 mgl 1 0 11 mgl 1 and 5 60 mgl 1 3 70 mgl 1 0 08 mgl 1 respectively in july 2013 the submerged macrophytes restoration project was implemented under the support of the management agency of west lake in hangzhou and the research group from institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences as the technical director and the surface of sediment was covered by a layer of modified clay minerals with a thickness of 10 cm which can enhance the survival rate of vegetation before planting wang et al 2018 the recovery area of submerged macrophytes in three sublakes of west lake maojiabu wuguitan and yuhuwan was 10 346 m2 3220 m2 and 1855 m2 respectively the selected submerged macrophytes species in the restoration project were vallisneria natans hydrilla verticillata potamogeton crispus and ceratophyllum demersum sampling sites are located in five sublakes of west lake namely maojiabu xilihu wuguitan yuhuwan and xiaonanhu totaling 16 sampling sites and the watershed of longhongjian stream and chishanxi stream as shown in fig 1 results from xilihu are listed in the supplementary data field sampling was conducted each month in 2013 2019 for each sampling site water parameters including temperature t ph electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp were determined by a ysi pro plus multi parameter water quality meter ysi incorporated yellow springs ohio usa the water depth was measured with a hand held depth sounder while simultaneously the secchi depth sd was measured by a white and black secchi disk the water turbidity was measured by a turbidimeter in situ water column samples were collected below the overlying water at a depth of 0 5 m and surface sediment was collected by a peterson dredge with three replicates then the three samples were mixed to create one sample the sediment samples were stored in air sealed plastic bags and kept at 4 c before laboratory tests the fresh sediment parameters including t ph and orp were measured in situ by the orp depolarization automatic analyzer nanjin china at each site three replicates submerged macrophyte samples were collected by a pronged grab 25 cm 35 cm the submerged macrophyte species were identified based on the flora of china volume liu et al 2013 submerged macrophyte samples were collected and washed by lake water to remove the adhered sediments invertebrates and alga in addition fresh plant biomass kgm 2 was calculated and the statistics of the species richness were collected for each site the fresh plant biomass was determined by coverage 2 2 laboratory analysis water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm millipore filters to determine the chlorophyll a chl a concentration using an extraction of 90 acetone the water filtrate by 0 45 mm cellulose acetate membranes was used to measure the concentrations of ammonia nh4 n nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp by colorimetry the concentration of chemical oxygen demand codcr was determined by potassium dichromate method the sediment samples were dried smashed and sieved with a standard 80 mesh screen the sediment powder was used to determine the sediment total nitrogen and total phosphorus by the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion method and molybdenum blue method respectively 2 3 data analyses all statistical analyses were conducted using spss 19 0 software the data were checked to determine whether they exhibited a normal distribution by a shapiro wilk test in advance of the statistical analyses the non normally distributed data underwent logarithmic square root or box cox transformations before the statistical analyses tukey s post hoc analysis of the two way anova test was used to determine the difference in water quality level sediment properties and submerged macrophyte characteristics for different sections and sampling seasons the relationship between the surrounding environmental factors and submerged macrophyte characteristics were assessed using pearson correlation analyses stepwise multiple regression analysis and redundancy analysis rda were applied to identify the primary variance of the environmental factors in the submerged macrophyte characteristics significance in the difference of variance was established with a p value 0 05 figures were made using origin 9 0 and canoca 5 0 software 3 results 3 1 monthly variations of water chemical parameters on long time scales the water codcr exhibited a rising trend over the course of the experiment with the highest concentration detected in september 2017 whereas the lowest concentration was detected in november 2013 fig 2 2a1 a4 the water tn tp nh4 n no3 n and chl a values show a continuously decreasing trend during the monitoring period figs 2 1 and 2 2 water chl a in the summer of 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 were significantly lower than that in 2014 and 2015 fig 2 1d1 d3 d4 the water no2 n dropped slightly during the study fig 2 1c1 c4 it can be seen from table s2 that the submerged macrophytes characteristics exhibited an obviously improvement the biomass of vegetation increased from 0 31 kgm 2 in july 2013 to 1 45 kgm 2 in july 2019 in west lake the water nh4 n no3 n tn and tp were declined from 0 15 mgl 1 1 83 mgl 1 2 75 mgl 1 and 0 07 mgl 1 in 2013 to 0 06 mgl 1 0 35 mgl 1 1 51 mgl 1 and 0 02 mgl 1 in 2019 respectively table 1 3 2 monthly variations of sediment chemical properties on long time scales the sediment chemical properties exhibited rising trends during the part of monitoring period from january 2014 to july 2019 in particular the sediment tn concentration showed the largest increase fig 3 1 then the sediment chemical concentrations exhibited downward trends the sediment tn and organic matter om concentrations in maojiabu and wuguitan were generally lower than those in yuhuwan and xiaonanhu fig 3 1a1 a4 c1 c4 3 3 monthly variations of submerged macrophytes on long time scales the species richness of submerged macrophytes showed a continuously increasing trend in all sections of west lake fig 4 1 the coverage and biomass of submerged macrophytes in maojiabu also exhibited an significantly increasing trend on the interannual scale table s1 whereas there was a slight reduction in wuguitan and yuhuwan from november 2015 to july 2017 then beginning to increase fig 4 1b1 b3 c1 c3 table s2 showed that submerged macrophytes characteristics exhibited obviously increases the biomass of vegetation increased from 0 31 kgm 2 in july 2013 to 1 45 kgm 2 in july 2019 in west lake 3 4 spatial and seasonal characteristics of water parameters two way anova results of water physical characteristics in terms of water depth and sd were significantly different among the four sections of west lake the water depth and sd in xiaonanhu were generally greater than in other sections the highest mean depth of water was found in xiaonanhu 2 46 0 14 m and the highest mean sd of water was also found in xiaonanhu water sd values in maojiabu yuhuwan and xiaonanhu in winter were significantly higher than those in summer all three sections also exhibited significantly higher values in winter than in autumn except for yuhuwan fig 2 3 a c the water do of maojiabu in winter was significantly higher than that in summer fig 2 3e whereas the water ph of yuhuwan in summer was significantly higher than that in autumn fig 2 3b the water ec values of wuguitan yuhuwan and xiaonanhu in autumn were significantly higher than those in spring fig 2 3f the water turbidity of all sections in summer and autumn was much greater than that in spring and winter fig 2 3g the water orp of all sections in spring was significantly lower than that in other seasons fig 2 3h for water nutrients two way anova results indicated that the water nh4 n of maojiabu was significantly greater than that of wuguitan and xiaonanhu in summer whereas the water nh4 n of all sections except for maojiabu in autumn and winter were generally greater than those in spring and summer fig 2 4 e the water codcr was generally greater in spring compared with that in the other seasons fig 2 4a maojiabu has the highest mean value of water no3 n in all seasons than other lake areas fig 2 4b on the contrary the water no2 n was the lowest in all seasons among all lake areas fig 2 4f in winter the mean value of water tn in all sections was lower than that in the other seasons whereas the water tn of maojiabu in spring and autumn was significantly higher than that in summer and winter fig 2 4c compared with the other seasons the water tp was a bit higher in the summer fig 2 4g 3 5 spatial and seasonal characteristic of sediment properties among the four sections there were significant differences in the sediment orp tn tp and om the sediment orp in all sections was greater in summer than in the other seasons except in xiaonanhu fig 3 2 c the sediment tn of xilihu and yuhuwan were generally greater than in other sections and the sediment tn of maojiabu was significantly lower than that in xilihu and yuhuwan fig s1a the sediment om of xilihu was significantly higher in all seasons comparing with the other sections fig s1c notably the sediment nutrients tn tp om of maojiabu were clearly the lowest whereas the second lowest section was wuguitan fig 3 2d e f the highest concentrations of sediment tn tp and om were found in winter fig 3 2f 3 6 spatial and seasonal characteristic of submerged macrophytes in all sections of west lake except xiaonanhu a total of eight submerged macrophyte species were found during the 6 years survey namely vallisneria natans hydrilla verticillata potamogeton crispus ceratophyllum demersum myriophyllum spicatum potamogeton maackianus najas marina and najas minor submerged macrophyte richness exhibited no significant difference among all sections but exhibited significant differences with respect to season summer greater than spring and winter among all sections maojiabu exhibited the highest values in richness coverage and biomass of the submerged macrophytes in summer autumn and winter there was a significant spatial difference of lake areas in coverage and biomass of submerged macrophyte and maojiabu significantly has the highest mean value of the vegetation coverage and biomass in autumn and winter compared with wuguitan fig 4 2 the distribution and biomass of vallisneria natans were the largest except for spring at which time potamogeton crispus has the highest distribution and was the dominant species in spring there was no distribution of hydrilla verticillata in any of the sections in west lake compared with other submerged macrophytes species potamogeton maackianus and najas marina were less distributed fig 5 3 7 relationship of submerged macrophytes with water quality and sediment properties results of the pearson correlation analysis between water sediment parameters and submerged macrophyte characteristics show that the submerged macrophyte richness was negatively correlated to water do orp no3 n tn and sediment orp but positively correlated to water ph temperature codcr sediment temperature ph tp and tn owing to the derivation of the biomass from the coverage both coverage and biomass maintained consistency coverage and biomass had a significant positive correlation to water turbidity sediment temperature and orp but opposite to the water orp and sediment om table 2 stepwise multiple regression results to determine the influence of environmental factors on submerged macrophyte characteristics stepwise regression analyses indicated that all environmental factors could explain 55 2 79 0 of the variance in the submerged macrophyte characteristics for the water and sediment chemical characteristics environmental physical factors could account for 42 7 96 4 and 80 2 87 0 of the variance respectively table 3 the first and second ordination axes of the rda eigenvalues were 0 4008 and 0 2010 respectively the total variation was 0 87349 with explanatory variables accounting for 78 7 of the variance and the adjusted explained variation was 29 1 explaining 40 08 of the species environment variance the correlation of the first axis between the species and environmental factors was 0 8790 the correlation of the second axis between the species and environmental factors of 0 9311 accounted for 60 17 of the species environment variance the major environmental factors related to the species distribution of submerged macrophytes were water ph tn no3 n no2 n and sediment orp and tn fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 monthly variations of water chemical parameters on long time scales for water chemical quality water codcr exhibited an increasing trend in the long term fig 2 2 this result could be due to the imputation of water from the yuhuangshan water treatment plant through two inlets located at the sampling positions fig 1 originating from river supplement the continuous entry of new water act as a vital role for modifying the water parameters and the vegetation abundance vanessa et al 2020 most of the nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants were removed from the original water of the qiantang river by the water treatment plant then the water was directed into west lake the water nh4 n tn and tp exhibited a significant decrease and the water quality remained in the clear state in addition the restoration of the submerged macrophytes in west lake was achieved which provided more ecological niches and then promoting the presence of zooplankton species with different functional traits indicating the vital impact of the submerged macrophytes in increasing the biodiversity of the aquatic system bakker et al 2013 in july 2013 the submerged macrophytes restoration project was implemented in west lake in hangzhou the recovery area of submerged macrophytes in three sublakes of west lake maojiabu wuguitan and yuhuwan was 10 346 m2 3220 m2 and 1855 m2 respectively in 2019 the cover area of submerged macrophytes in maojiabu wuguitan and yuhuwan was 292 038 m2 49 840 m2 and 56 795 m2 as the grow and vast propagation along with the development of submerged macrophytes communities the role of macrophytes as water quality regulators becomes more significant lau and lane 2002b sager 2009 liu et al 2020 moreover the management agencies of west lake in hangzhou have carried out several management practices including sewage interception engineering vegetation restoration of lakeshore zone submerged macrophytes harvest and watershed management which work together improving the water quality in addition water quality of the two streams into west lake was improved because of watershed management 4 2 monthly variations of sediment chemical parameters on long time scales for the sediment chemical properties the tn tp and om exhibit an increasing trend that could be attributed to the gradual development of the submerged macrophyte community which transfers the nitrogen and organic matter into sediment through biodeposition lei et al 2008 in addition metabolism in aquatic macrophytes was confirmed resulting in the accumulation of organic matter in the sediment smits et al 1990 submerged macrophytes can inhibit the release of nitrogen and phosphorus from the sediment and reduce the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus partly enhancing the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus in the sediment by the decomposition of its litter 4 3 monthly variations of submerged macrophytes on long time scales the long term characteristics of submerged macrophytes results demonstrated that ecological restoration engineering was beneficial to the reestablishment of the submerged macrophyte community in west lake date on mean density ind l 1 and recorded species number of zooplankton families was showed in table s3 west lake had the greatest number of species 40 in march 2019 overall and the fewest 12 in march 2017 number of species increased from april 2016 to march 2019 in west lake and generally exhibited a higher value in warm seasons compared to cold seasons table s3 it is interesting that the density of rotifers and protozoan showed a slightly increasing but the cladocerans and copepod declined similarly phytoplankton species number increased table s4 and the most abundant zooplankton functional groups were diatom followed by chorophyta cyanobacteria dinoflagellate cryptomonas chrysophyceae and euglena table s5 which indicated water maintain the clean and stable status dixit et al 1992 kingstone et al 1992 dixit et al 1998 the annual coverage and biomass of the submerged macrophytes in yuhuwan and wuguitan had a slight decrease table s1 which might be attributed to the lack of a purse seine setting in these areas to prevent herbivorous fishes 4 4 spatial and seasonal characteristics of water parameters seasonal changes had a significant effect on the water physical and chemical parameters including do ph conductivity temperature sd codcr nh4 n no2 n tn and tp the water sd and turbidity of most sections in winter was generally greater than that in summer and autumn which could be attributed to the mass outbreak of zooplankton and phytoplankton due to higher temperatures pomati et al 2019 the water codcr of all sections in spring was significantly greater than that in other seasons this result could be ascribed to the two stages of aquatic plant litter decomposition chimney and pietro 2006 xie et al 2004 in the first stage not much nutrients were released to water from october to next february with the lower temperature rather than were kept in the remains of the plant in the second stage increasing decaying ratio of plants because of the warm weather from march to april a lot of nutrients were released to water zhang et al 2013 owing to the large scale distribution of potamogeton crispus in spring and summer water nh4 n in autumn and winter was significantly greater than in spring and summer this might imply that potamogeton crispus began to decompose during autumn and winter zhou et al 2019 in addition high density potamogeton crispus can reduce the ammonia concentration of the overlying water zhou et al 2017 fan et al 2016 for the water no3 n maojiabu exhibited generally greater values than the other lake areas this could be explained by the highest distribution of submerged macrophytes in maojiabu especially vallisneria natans with developed root systems during summer these submerged macrophyte communities with functional root characteristics can transport more oxygen to the ambient sediment of the root by o2 secretion and promote sediment nitrification zhang and scherer 2002 in conclusion maojiabu has the lowest mean value of water no2 n among all lake areas the water tn of maojiabu in spring and autumn was significantly higher than in other seasons this result could be attributed to the land use types of the stream longhongjian located in maojiabu fig 1 there are a number of longjing tea gardens that belong to the watershed applying chemical fertilizers in the harvest seasons spring and autumn the water quality of the lakes was closely related to land use types of the watershed oyarzún and huber 2003 trebitz et al 2019 the water tp in summer was a bit higher than in other seasons perhaps attributed to the following owing to the increase in temperature the activities of the microorganisms including bacteria benthic alga and phytoplankton were improved resulting in the release of fe al p due to the reduction of fe iii from fe ooh to fe ii induced by the low redox potential condition in addition p was released from the orthophosphate and hydroxide in the sediment through the intensive mineralization of organics zhang et al 2016b 4 5 spatial and seasonal characteristics of sediment properties except xiaonanhu which had almost no submerged macrophyte distribution the sediment orp of other sections in summer was generally greater than in other seasons consistent with this result yuan et al reported that the positive correlation between the submerged macrophyte biomass and the sediment orp may be attributed to the increased oxygen availability yuan et al 2018 after the westward project of west lake the flow field has been divided into three parts namely the upstream lake areas to the west of the yang gong causeway the midstream lake areas between the yang gong causeway and su causeway and the downstream lake areas to the east of the su causeway the result of the greater values of sediment tn and om in xilihu which resides in the midstream lake area compared with the other sections which reside in the upstream lake area is similar to the reported results liu et al 2018a moreover another reason could be that xilihu used to be rice fields and the surface sediment nutrients can reflect the deposition and sedimentation of organic material and pollutants over decades and centuries liu et al 2015 the fact that the sediment tp and om of all sections in winter were greater than those in other seasons could be attributed to the greater nutrient accumulation caused by the low flows in winter dalu et al 2019 liu et al 2018b sediment nutrients tn tp om of maojiabu were clearly the lowest of all the sections because maojiabu has the largest number of submerged macrophytes in which vallisneria natans is dominant promoting the nutrient uptake from the sediment barko and smart 1986 rattray et al 1991 in addition the management agency of west lake carried out the proper harvest of submerged macrophytes removing some of the nutrients from the sediment indirectly 4 6 relationship between submerged macrophytes and water quality and sediment properties several reports demonstrated that water quality and sediment properties were correlated with the submerged macrophyte characteristics in shallow lakes liu et al 2008 zhang et al 2016a in this study submerged macrophyte richness exhibits a significantly negative correlation with water do and orp reflecting the good quality of the water both species richness coverage and biomass of submerged macrophytes exhibited significantly increasing from 2013 to 2019 and the water nh4 n no3 n tn and tp showed significantly decreasing along with the propagation of submerged macrophytes after the ecological engineering was carried out fig 6 which demonstrated that submerged macrophytes can improve water quality and keep the clear water status moreover the result of multivariate regression analysis also testified the improving effect of submerged macrophytes on water quality table 4 moreover submerged macrophytes species richness exhibited significantly negative correlation with water orp no3 n tn and sediment orp and opposite relationship with water t and sediment t tn and tp the results testified more species richness of submerged macrophytes could utilize more kinds of water nutrients and thus maintain the clear water states the absorbed nutrients by macrophytes were removed through harvest or transferred to sediment through decomposition in addition water quality of the two streams into west lake was improved because of the related watershed management water tn no3 n and tp of longhongjian stream in 2013 and 2019 were 8 10 mgl 1 7 25 mgl 1 0 11 mgl 1 and 5 60 mgl 1 3 70 mgl 1 0 08 mgl 1 respectively and the water quality improvement was partly contributed to lake management strategies including external pollutants control and water diversion project the concentration of tn and tp was 2 34 mgl 1 and 0 15 mgl 1 respectively from water treatment plant we found that there is no significant relationship between the submerged macrophyte richness and biomass and water transparency sd even though many studies reported that the submerged macrophyte richness and biomass had a positive correlation with water sd hu et al 2008 romo et al 2004 sand jensen et al 2000 although water sd exhibited positive relationship but insignificant with submerged macrophytes characteristics the water quality was improved considering the water tn tp and chl a variation after completion the restoration project yang et al reported that there is a suitable water depth 2 1 m for which it is possible to maximize submerged biomass and the submerged macrophyte biomass could decrease gradually with continuously increasing water depth yang et al 2019 this could be due to the water depth of west lake mean value of depth is 1 67 0 41 m being lower than that in the other lakes located in yangtze river where in some sections the lakebed can be seen meanwhile the water depth has not been the primary limiting condition when submerged macrophytes can obtain adequate light results of the rda between the submerged macrophyte coverage and environmental factors indicated that water tn no3 n no2 n and ph and sediment orp and tn were the main factors determining the submerged macrophyte distribution this result implies that water nutrients have a stronger influence than sediment nutrient on submerged macrophytes consistent with previous studies kuntz et al 2014 xing et al 2013 in this study the mean values of sediment tn and tp were 5 94 2 54 and 2 03 0 62 mg g 1 respectively much greater than the sediment tn and tp 2 03 and 0 56 mg g 1 respectively of the lakes located in yangtze river this result illustrated that sediment nutrient could not influence the submerged macrophyte distribution in addition the coverage of myriophyllum spicatum was positively correlated to the water tn and no3 n whereas it was negatively correlated to the sediment tn however the coverage of hydrilla verticillata vallisneria natans and potamogeton maackianus exhibited contrary results this result could be attributed to the fact that myriophyllum spicatum is a canopy type submerged macrophyte as opposed to hydrilla verticillata vallisneria natans and potamogeton maackianus obtaining nutrients from a water column higher than the sediment on the contrary benthic submerged macrophytes especially vallisneria natans have developed a root system that can obtain more nutrients from the sediment the dominance of these four species of submerged macrophytes in west lake could be due to the high stoichiometric homeostasis coefficients of p of these four species which tends to lead to a more stable regime su et al 2019 the largest distribution of vallisneria natans may be due to the facts that vallisneria natans can compensate substantial leaf tissue as it suffers partial loss and this ability is enhanced when the sediment is at a high nutrient level this also explained the coexistence of vallisneria natans with herbivores especially in freshwater ecosystems li et al 2010 5 conclusion water parameters and sediment properties of west lake exhibited significant differences with respect to location and season the differences in the water physical parameters codcr and tp in water were ascribed to seasonal changes whereas the differences in the water tn was attributed to the different land use type of each watershed section moreover the differences in the sediment properties were due to the season changes and flow field of west lake this research builds upon the successful implementation of the submerged macrophyte restoration of west lake along with the propagation of submerged macrophytes after the ecological engineering was carried out submerged macrophytes can improve water quality and keep the clear water status in particular the largest submerged macrophyte distribution was exhibited in maojiabu which has grown into stable communities compared with the other sections results of the research illustrated that the gradual increase in the submerged macrophytes communities can enhance the ecological functions that govern the water nutrient concentrations nh4 n tn and tp sustainably decreasing and maintaining the clear state of the water meanwhile the water nutrient concentration has a stronger influence than the sediment nutrient concentration on the submerged macrophyte distribution based on its characteristics including a developed root system high stoichiometric homeostasis coefficients of p and the compensation ability of the substantial leaf tissue vallisneria natans has become the dominant species of west lake however the sediment chemical properties tn tp and om exhibit an increasing trend with the restoration of the submerged macrophytes in west lake especially tn this point implies that the gradually developing submerged macrophyte communities can accelerate the accumulation of sediment nutrient and merely establishing the submerged macrophytes communities is largely insufficient in aquatic ecological rehabilitation to ensure the stability of the aquatic ecosystem after performing the submerged macrophyte restoration a greater emphasis must be placed on reestablishing the entire ecosystem including the restoration of aquatic animals and fish stocks declaration of competing

17554,submerged macrophyte restoration is the key stage in the reestablishment of an aquatic ecosystem previous studies have paid considerable attention to the effect of multiple environmental factors on submerged macrophytes meanwhile few studies have been conducted regarding the spatial and seasonal characteristics of water and sediment properties and their long term relationship with submerged macrophytes after the implementation of the submerged macrophytes restoration project on a monthly basis we monitored the spatial and seasonal variation in water parameters sediment properties and the submerged macrophyte characteristics of west lake in hangzhou from august 2013 to july 2019 from these measurements we characterized the relationship between environmental factors and submerged macrophytes water nutrient concentrations continuously decreased with time and the accumulation of sediment nutrients was accelerated as the submerged macrophyte communities developed on a long term scale the results indicated that the difference in water parameters was due to seasonal changes and land use types in the watershed the differences in the sediment properties were mainly attributed to seasonal changes and changes in the flow field redundancy analysis showed that the influence of water nutrients on the submerged macrophyte distribution was greater than that of sediment nutrients the result also suggested that the developed root system high stoichiometric homeostasis coefficients of p and compensation ability of substantial leaf tissue may lead to a large distribution of vallisneria natans in west lake in hangzhou the correlation of water parameters and sediment properties with submerged macrophytes for a long time was very important as the restoration was achieved to ensure the stability of the aquatic ecosystem after performing the submerged macrophyte restoration a greater emphasis must be placed on reestablishing the entire ecosystem including the restoration of aquatic animals and fish stocks we expect these findings to serve as a reference for researchers and government agencies in the field of aquatic ecosystem restoration graphical abstract image

influenced the water status on the surface of earth resulting in water eutrophication which is characterized by nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants conley et al 2009 schindler et al 2008 with the increase in the loading of nitrogen and phosphorus due to industrial emissions agricultural fertilization and domestic resources many shallow lakes have realized toxic algal blooms which leads to the global decline of aquatic biodiversity blindow 1992 and ecological function smith and schindler 2009 vitousek et al 2002 with a worse scenario occurring in developing countries vass et al 2015 wu et al 2006 transforming from being dominated by submerged macrophytes these shallow lakes may exhibit an alternative stable state characterized by turbid phytoplankton overgrowth because of the increasing input of nutrients scheffer 1989 to reverse the emergence of phytoplankton dominated lakes returning to lakes dominated by submerged macrophytes simultaneously achieving positive circulation and self regulation is important many studies have indicated that submerged macrophytes play an important role in ecological restoration owing to their ecological function which includes controlling sediments resuspension rolland et al 2015 facilitating nutrient uptake from the surrounding environment granéli and solander 1988 and providing a habitat and food for aquatic animals engelhardt and ritchie 2001 wood et al 2017 submerged phytoremediation technology has been widely accepted by researchers and government departments to improve water quality and aquatic ecosystems therefore more governmental agencies globally have carried out many large scale submerged macrophyte restoration projects birk et al 2012 song et al 2018 that attempt to enhance water quality promote species diversity and relax the influence of anthropogenic eutrophication on the aquatic system the goal of these projects is to interrupt the turbid phytoplankton overgrowth and the stable water status transforming the aquatic system into clean water status however the frequently dynamic variation of submerged macrophyte and phytoplankton in composition and abundance in shallow lakes should be got more concerns for sustaining lake functioning and stability sayer et al 2009 sayer et al 2010 phytoplankton biomass was associated with water nutrients and zooplankton in seasonal variation lau and lane 2002a with present of the low level submerged macrophyte coverage only water nutrients limitation while nutrients and zooplankton which both limiting phytoplankton biomass in macrophyte free shallow lakes lau and lane 2002b the ecological niche of aquatic macrophytes is defined by sediment properties and the conditions of the surrounding medium and water vukov et al 2017 owing to severe influence of the terrestrial elements of the associated watershed lacoul and freedman 2006 these factors can represent the environmental status of the water system and reflect historical human activity edwards et al 2000 physical and chemical characteristics of both the water column and sediment may explain the variation in submerged macrophytes boedeltje et al 2001 compared with phytoplankton submerged macrophyte growth was more dependent on the sediment nutrient source whereby sediments may supply nutrients when the open water nutrient level was reduced the growth distribution and species composition of the macrophyte vegetation was more closely related to the current velocity and water depth than the chemical factors in the river or stream owing to anthropic impact steffen et al 2014 and also the physical and chemical properties of the sediment including density ph and total nitrogen tn antunes et al 2012 due to overdevelopment of lake basins and excessive pollutants inputs guo 2007 any alteration of submerged macrophytes community could have a large effect on the ecosystem processes and functions alexander et al 2008 beck et al 2010 the interaction among water parameters sediment properties and submerged macrophytes plays a vital role in regulating ecosystem structure and maintaining the water quality level scheffer et al 2001 bornette et al 2011 stable clear water level and the diverse submerged macrophytes community only could appear through a long term restoration after the reduction of external nutrient load hilt et al 2018 although several investigations have focused on the impacts of environmental conditions including water quality parameters sediment properties and nutrient content on submerged macrophytes in large shallow lakes pan et al 2011 rodrigo et al 2013 few studies have established the spatial and temporal variability of water column quality sediment properties and species composition of the submerged macrophytes over the long term detailed monitoring of the environment surrounding aquatic systems over a long period of time may provide further evidence to explain the observed pattern in this study we investigated the overlying water quality properties of sediments and submerged macrophyte characteristics continuously over a 6 years period 2013 2019 in west lake in hangzhou our goals were the following 1 understand the variation in water quality sediment properties and submerged macrophyte characteristics at long time scales 2 understand the spatial and seasonal variation of water parameters sediment properties and submerged macrophyte distribution after ecological restoration efforts 3 determine the main environmental factors that influence submerged macrophytes and 4 investigate the reasons for the extent of the submerged macrophyte community and the dominant species in west lake in hangzhou the results of this study are expected to provide theoretical guidance for the management and maintenance of submerged plants in west lake in hangzhou and similar lakes after restoration 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design and field sampling west lake 120 12 58 16 27 e 30 22 73 25 97 n is located in zhejiang province in western china a typically urban shallow lake which is still faces eutrophication problems because of the factors such as small storage capacity long hydraulic retention time and the excessively anthropogenic and natural nutrient inputs in the past few decades lin et al 2020 pei and wang 2003 song et al 2003 it has been classified as a world heritage site in 2011 the lake is recognized as a typical shallow and eutrophic lake with a surface water area of 6 5 km2 and a mean depth of 2 27 m zhang et al 2016b longhongjian stream and chishanxi stream were two important sources of west lake containing the two streams mainstream and tributary which originates from longjing spring and yuegui mountain respectively longhongjian stream pour into west lake at the west side of its sublake maojiabu mixed evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forest accounts for approximately 70 20 by tea plantation and 10 by residential transportation area and water body of total watershed area of longhongjian stream han et al 2018 compared to chishanxi stream the watershed of longhongjian stream has more drainage area of forest land and tea plantation however wuguitan and xiaonanhu only have watershed area of forest and residential area fig 1 longhongjian stream watershed of tea plantation and forest areas contributed to a dominated proportion of the tn export into west lake han et al 2018 the watershed of five sublakes can be classified into combined forest residential and large scale tea plantation land maojiabu combined forest residential and small scale tea plantation land yuhuwan and only combined forest and residential land wuguitan xilihu and xiaonanhu in addition water quality of the two streams into west lake was improved because of watershed management water tn no3 n and tp of longhongjian stream in 2013 and 2019 were 8 10 mgl 1 7 25 mgl 1 0 11 mgl 1 and 5 60 mgl 1 3 70 mgl 1 0 08 mgl 1 respectively in july 2013 the submerged macrophytes restoration project was implemented under the support of the management agency of west lake in hangzhou and the research group from institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences as the technical director and the surface of sediment was covered by a layer of modified clay minerals with a thickness of 10 cm which can enhance the survival rate of vegetation before planting wang et al 2018 the recovery area of submerged macrophytes in three sublakes of west lake maojiabu wuguitan and yuhuwan was 10 346 m2 3220 m2 and 1855 m2 respectively the selected submerged macrophytes species in the restoration project were vallisneria natans hydrilla verticillata potamogeton crispus and ceratophyllum demersum sampling sites are located in five sublakes of west lake namely maojiabu xilihu wuguitan yuhuwan and xiaonanhu totaling 16 sampling sites and the watershed of longhongjian stream and chishanxi stream as shown in fig 1 results from xilihu are listed in the supplementary data field sampling was conducted each month in 2013 2019 for each sampling site water parameters including temperature t ph electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp were determined by a ysi pro plus multi parameter water quality meter ysi incorporated yellow springs ohio usa the water depth was measured with a hand held depth sounder while simultaneously the secchi depth sd was measured by a white and black secchi disk the water turbidity was measured by a turbidimeter in situ water column samples were collected below the overlying water at a depth of 0 5 m and surface sediment was collected by a peterson dredge with three replicates then the three samples were mixed to create one sample the sediment samples were stored in air sealed plastic bags and kept at 4 c before laboratory tests the fresh sediment parameters including t ph and orp were measured in situ by the orp depolarization automatic analyzer nanjin china at each site three replicates submerged macrophyte samples were collected by a pronged grab 25 cm 35 cm the submerged macrophyte species were identified based on the flora of china volume liu et al 2013 submerged macrophyte samples were collected and washed by lake water to remove the adhered sediments invertebrates and alga in addition fresh plant biomass kgm 2 was calculated and the statistics of the species richness were collected for each site the fresh plant biomass was determined by coverage 2 2 laboratory analysis water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm millipore filters to determine the chlorophyll a chl a concentration using an extraction of 90 acetone the water filtrate by 0 45 mm cellulose acetate membranes was used to measure the concentrations of ammonia nh4 n nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp by colorimetry the concentration of chemical oxygen demand codcr was determined by potassium dichromate method the sediment samples were dried smashed and sieved with a standard 80 mesh screen the sediment powder was used to determine the sediment total nitrogen and total phosphorus by the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion method and molybdenum blue method respectively 2 3 data analyses all statistical analyses were conducted using spss 19 0 software the data were checked to determine whether they exhibited a normal distribution by a shapiro wilk test in advance of the statistical analyses the non normally distributed data underwent logarithmic square root or box cox transformations before the statistical analyses tukey s post hoc analysis of the two way anova test was used to determine the difference in water quality level sediment properties and submerged macrophyte characteristics for different sections and sampling seasons the relationship between the surrounding environmental factors and submerged macrophyte characteristics were assessed using pearson correlation analyses stepwise multiple regression analysis and redundancy analysis rda were applied to identify the primary variance of the environmental factors in the submerged macrophyte characteristics significance in the difference of variance was established with a p value 0 05 figures were made using origin 9 0 and canoca 5 0 software 3 results 3 1 monthly variations of water chemical parameters on long time scales the water codcr exhibited a rising trend over the course of the experiment with the highest concentration detected in september 2017 whereas the lowest concentration was detected in november 2013 fig 2 2a1 a4 the water tn tp nh4 n no3 n and chl a values show a continuously decreasing trend during the monitoring period figs 2 1 and 2 2 water chl a in the summer of 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 were significantly lower than that in 2014 and 2015 fig 2 1d1 d3 d4 the water no2 n dropped slightly during the study fig 2 1c1 c4 it can be seen from table s2 that the submerged macrophytes characteristics exhibited an obviously improvement the biomass of vegetation increased from 0 31 kgm 2 in july 2013 to 1 45 kgm 2 in july 2019 in west lake the water nh4 n no3 n tn and tp were declined from 0 15 mgl 1 1 83 mgl 1 2 75 mgl 1 and 0 07 mgl 1 in 2013 to 0 06 mgl 1 0 35 mgl 1 1 51 mgl 1 and 0 02 mgl 1 in 2019 respectively table 1 3 2 monthly variations of sediment chemical properties on long time scales the sediment chemical properties exhibited rising trends during the part of monitoring period from january 2014 to july 2019 in particular the sediment tn concentration showed the largest increase fig 3 1 then the sediment chemical concentrations exhibited downward trends the sediment tn and organic matter om concentrations in maojiabu and wuguitan were generally lower than those in yuhuwan and xiaonanhu fig 3 1a1 a4 c1 c4 3 3 monthly variations of submerged macrophytes on long time scales the species richness of submerged macrophytes showed a continuously increasing trend in all sections of west lake fig 4 1 the coverage and biomass of submerged macrophytes in maojiabu also exhibited an significantly increasing trend on the interannual scale table s1 whereas there was a slight reduction in wuguitan and yuhuwan from november 2015 to july 2017 then beginning to increase fig 4 1b1 b3 c1 c3 table s2 showed that submerged macrophytes characteristics exhibited obviously increases the biomass of vegetation increased from 0 31 kgm 2 in july 2013 to 1 45 kgm 2 in july 2019 in west lake 3 4 spatial and seasonal characteristics of water parameters two way anova results of water physical characteristics in terms of water depth and sd were significantly different among the four sections of west lake the water depth and sd in xiaonanhu were generally greater than in other sections the highest mean depth of water was found in xiaonanhu 2 46 0 14 m and the highest mean sd of water was also found in xiaonanhu water sd values in maojiabu yuhuwan and xiaonanhu in winter were significantly higher than those in summer all three sections also exhibited significantly higher values in winter than in autumn except for yuhuwan fig 2 3 a c the water do of maojiabu in winter was significantly higher than that in summer fig 2 3e whereas the water ph of yuhuwan in summer was significantly higher than that in autumn fig 2 3b the water ec values of wuguitan yuhuwan and xiaonanhu in autumn were significantly higher than those in spring fig 2 3f the water turbidity of all sections in summer and autumn was much greater than that in spring and winter fig 2 3g the water orp of all sections in spring was significantly lower than that in other seasons fig 2 3h for water nutrients two way anova results indicated that the water nh4 n of maojiabu was significantly greater than that of wuguitan and xiaonanhu in summer whereas the water nh4 n of all sections except for maojiabu in autumn and winter were generally greater than those in spring and summer fig 2 4 e the water codcr was generally greater in spring compared with that in the other seasons fig 2 4a maojiabu has the highest mean value of water no3 n in all seasons than other lake areas fig 2 4b on the contrary the water no2 n was the lowest in all seasons among all lake areas fig 2 4f in winter the mean value of water tn in all sections was lower than that in the other seasons whereas the water tn of maojiabu in spring and autumn was significantly higher than that in summer and winter fig 2 4c compared with the other seasons the water tp was a bit higher in the summer fig 2 4g 3 5 spatial and seasonal characteristic of sediment properties among the four sections there were significant differences in the sediment orp tn tp and om the sediment orp in all sections was greater in summer than in the other seasons except in xiaonanhu fig 3 2 c the sediment tn of xilihu and yuhuwan were generally greater than in other sections and the sediment tn of maojiabu was significantly lower than that in xilihu and yuhuwan fig s1a the sediment om of xilihu was significantly higher in all seasons comparing with the other sections fig s1c notably the sediment nutrients tn tp om of maojiabu were clearly the lowest whereas the second lowest section was wuguitan fig 3 2d e f the highest concentrations of sediment tn tp and om were found in winter fig 3 2f 3 6 spatial and seasonal characteristic of submerged macrophytes in all sections of west lake except xiaonanhu a total of eight submerged macrophyte species were found during the 6 years survey namely vallisneria natans hydrilla verticillata potamogeton crispus ceratophyllum demersum myriophyllum spicatum potamogeton maackianus najas marina and najas minor submerged macrophyte richness exhibited no significant difference among all sections but exhibited significant differences with respect to season summer greater than spring and winter among all sections maojiabu exhibited the highest values in richness coverage and biomass of the submerged macrophytes in summer autumn and winter there was a significant spatial difference of lake areas in coverage and biomass of submerged macrophyte and maojiabu significantly has the highest mean value of the vegetation coverage and biomass in autumn and winter compared with wuguitan fig 4 2 the distribution and biomass of vallisneria natans were the largest except for spring at which time potamogeton crispus has the highest distribution and was the dominant species in spring there was no distribution of hydrilla verticillata in any of the sections in west lake compared with other submerged macrophytes species potamogeton maackianus and najas marina were less distributed fig 5 3 7 relationship of submerged macrophytes with water quality and sediment properties results of the pearson correlation analysis between water sediment parameters and submerged macrophyte characteristics show that the submerged macrophyte richness was negatively correlated to water do orp no3 n tn and sediment orp but positively correlated to water ph temperature codcr sediment temperature ph tp and tn owing to the derivation of the biomass from the coverage both coverage and biomass maintained consistency coverage and biomass had a significant positive correlation to water turbidity sediment temperature and orp but opposite to the water orp and sediment om table 2 stepwise multiple regression results to determine the influence of environmental factors on submerged macrophyte characteristics stepwise regression analyses indicated that all environmental factors could explain 55 2 79 0 of the variance in the submerged macrophyte characteristics for the water and sediment chemical characteristics environmental physical factors could account for 42 7 96 4 and 80 2 87 0 of the variance respectively table 3 the first and second ordination axes of the rda eigenvalues were 0 4008 and 0 2010 respectively the total variation was 0 87349 with explanatory variables accounting for 78 7 of the variance and the adjusted explained variation was 29 1 explaining 40 08 of the species environment variance the correlation of the first axis between the species and environmental factors was 0 8790 the correlation of the second axis between the species and environmental factors of 0 9311 accounted for 60 17 of the species environment variance the major environmental factors related to the species distribution of submerged macrophytes were water ph tn no3 n no2 n and sediment orp and tn fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 monthly variations of water chemical parameters on long time scales for water chemical quality water codcr exhibited an increasing trend in the long term fig 2 2 this result could be due to the imputation of water from the yuhuangshan water treatment plant through two inlets located at the sampling positions fig 1 originating from river supplement the continuous entry of new water act as a vital role for modifying the water parameters and the vegetation abundance vanessa et al 2020 most of the nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants were removed from the original water of the qiantang river by the water treatment plant then the water was directed into west lake the water nh4 n tn and tp exhibited a significant decrease and the water quality remained in the clear state in addition the restoration of the submerged macrophytes in west lake was achieved which provided more ecological niches and then promoting the presence of zooplankton species with different functional traits indicating the vital impact of the submerged macrophytes in increasing the biodiversity of the aquatic system bakker et al 2013 in july 2013 the submerged macrophytes restoration project was implemented in west lake in hangzhou the recovery area of submerged macrophytes in three sublakes of west lake maojiabu wuguitan and yuhuwan was 10 346 m2 3220 m2 and 1855 m2 respectively in 2019 the cover area of submerged macrophytes in maojiabu wuguitan and yuhuwan was 292 038 m2 49 840 m2 and 56 795 m2 as the grow and vast propagation along with the development of submerged macrophytes communities the role of macrophytes as water quality regulators becomes more significant lau and lane 2002b sager 2009 liu et al 2020 moreover the management agencies of west lake in hangzhou have carried out several management practices including sewage interception engineering vegetation restoration of lakeshore zone submerged macrophytes harvest and watershed management which work together improving the water quality in addition water quality of the two streams into west lake was improved because of watershed management 4 2 monthly variations of sediment chemical parameters on long time scales for the sediment chemical properties the tn tp and om exhibit an increasing trend that could be attributed to the gradual development of the submerged macrophyte community which transfers the nitrogen and organic matter into sediment through biodeposition lei et al 2008 in addition metabolism in aquatic macrophytes was confirmed resulting in the accumulation of organic matter in the sediment smits et al 1990 submerged macrophytes can inhibit the release of nitrogen and phosphorus from the sediment and reduce the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus partly enhancing the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus in the sediment by the decomposition of its litter 4 3 monthly variations of submerged macrophytes on long time scales the long term characteristics of submerged macrophytes results demonstrated that ecological restoration engineering was beneficial to the reestablishment of the submerged macrophyte community in west lake date on mean density ind l 1 and recorded species number of zooplankton families was showed in table s3 west lake had the greatest number of species 40 in march 2019 overall and the fewest 12 in march 2017 number of species increased from april 2016 to march 2019 in west lake and generally exhibited a higher value in warm seasons compared to cold seasons table s3 it is interesting that the density of rotifers and protozoan showed a slightly increasing but the cladocerans and copepod declined similarly phytoplankton species number increased table s4 and the most abundant zooplankton functional groups were diatom followed by chorophyta cyanobacteria dinoflagellate cryptomonas chrysophyceae and euglena table s5 which indicated water maintain the clean and stable status dixit et al 1992 kingstone et al 1992 dixit et al 1998 the annual coverage and biomass of the submerged macrophytes in yuhuwan and wuguitan had a slight decrease table s1 which might be attributed to the lack of a purse seine setting in these areas to prevent herbivorous fishes 4 4 spatial and seasonal characteristics of water parameters seasonal changes had a significant effect on the water physical and chemical parameters including do ph conductivity temperature sd codcr nh4 n no2 n tn and tp the water sd and turbidity of most sections in winter was generally greater than that in summer and autumn which could be attributed to the mass outbreak of zooplankton and phytoplankton due to higher temperatures pomati et al 2019 the water codcr of all sections in spring was significantly greater than that in other seasons this result could be ascribed to the two stages of aquatic plant litter decomposition chimney and pietro 2006 xie et al 2004 in the first stage not much nutrients were released to water from october to next february with the lower temperature rather than were kept in the remains of the plant in the second stage increasing decaying ratio of plants because of the warm weather from march to april a lot of nutrients were released to water zhang et al 2013 owing to the large scale distribution of potamogeton crispus in spring and summer water nh4 n in autumn and winter was significantly greater than in spring and summer this might imply that potamogeton crispus began to decompose during autumn and winter zhou et al 2019 in addition high density potamogeton crispus can reduce the ammonia concentration of the overlying water zhou et al 2017 fan et al 2016 for the water no3 n maojiabu exhibited generally greater values than the other lake areas this could be explained by the highest distribution of submerged macrophytes in maojiabu especially vallisneria natans with developed root systems during summer these submerged macrophyte communities with functional root characteristics can transport more oxygen to the ambient sediment of the root by o2 secretion and promote sediment nitrification zhang and scherer 2002 in conclusion maojiabu has the lowest mean value of water no2 n among all lake areas the water tn of maojiabu in spring and autumn was significantly higher than in other seasons this result could be attributed to the land use types of the stream longhongjian located in maojiabu fig 1 there are a number of longjing tea gardens that belong to the watershed applying chemical fertilizers in the harvest seasons spring and autumn the water quality of the lakes was closely related to land use types of the watershed oyarzún and huber 2003 trebitz et al 2019 the water tp in summer was a bit higher than in other seasons perhaps attributed to the following owing to the increase in temperature the activities of the microorganisms including bacteria benthic alga and phytoplankton were improved resulting in the release of fe al p due to the reduction of fe iii from fe ooh to fe ii induced by the low redox potential condition in addition p was released from the orthophosphate and hydroxide in the sediment through the intensive mineralization of organics zhang et al 2016b 4 5 spatial and seasonal characteristics of sediment properties except xiaonanhu which had almost no submerged macrophyte distribution the sediment orp of other sections in summer was generally greater than in other seasons consistent with this result yuan et al reported that the positive correlation between the submerged macrophyte biomass and the sediment orp may be attributed to the increased oxygen availability yuan et al 2018 after the westward project of west lake the flow field has been divided into three parts namely the upstream lake areas to the west of the yang gong causeway the midstream lake areas between the yang gong causeway and su causeway and the downstream lake areas to the east of the su causeway the result of the greater values of sediment tn and om in xilihu which resides in the midstream lake area compared with the other sections which reside in the upstream lake area is similar to the reported results liu et al 2018a moreover another reason could be that xilihu used to be rice fields and the surface sediment nutrients can reflect the deposition and sedimentation of organic material and pollutants over decades and centuries liu et al 2015 the fact that the sediment tp and om of all sections in winter were greater than those in other seasons could be attributed to the greater nutrient accumulation caused by the low flows in winter dalu et al 2019 liu et al 2018b sediment nutrients tn tp om of maojiabu were clearly the lowest of all the sections because maojiabu has the largest number of submerged macrophytes in which vallisneria natans is dominant promoting the nutrient uptake from the sediment barko and smart 1986 rattray et al 1991 in addition the management agency of west lake carried out the proper harvest of submerged macrophytes removing some of the nutrients from the sediment indirectly 4 6 relationship between submerged macrophytes and water quality and sediment properties several reports demonstrated that water quality and sediment properties were correlated with the submerged macrophyte characteristics in shallow lakes liu et al 2008 zhang et al 2016a in this study submerged macrophyte richness exhibits a significantly negative correlation with water do and orp reflecting the good quality of the water both species richness coverage and biomass of submerged macrophytes exhibited significantly increasing from 2013 to 2019 and the water nh4 n no3 n tn and tp showed significantly decreasing along with the propagation of submerged macrophytes after the ecological engineering was carried out fig 6 which demonstrated that submerged macrophytes can improve water quality and keep the clear water status moreover the result of multivariate regression analysis also testified the improving effect of submerged macrophytes on water quality table 4 moreover submerged macrophytes species richness exhibited significantly negative correlation with water orp no3 n tn and sediment orp and opposite relationship with water t and sediment t tn and tp the results testified more species richness of submerged macrophytes could utilize more kinds of water nutrients and thus maintain the clear water states the absorbed nutrients by macrophytes were removed through harvest or transferred to sediment through decomposition in addition water quality of the two streams into west lake was improved because of the related watershed management water tn no3 n and tp of longhongjian stream in 2013 and 2019 were 8 10 mgl 1 7 25 mgl 1 0 11 mgl 1 and 5 60 mgl 1 3 70 mgl 1 0 08 mgl 1 respectively and the water quality improvement was partly contributed to lake management strategies including external pollutants control and water diversion project the concentration of tn and tp was 2 34 mgl 1 and 0 15 mgl 1 respectively from water treatment plant we found that there is no significant relationship between the submerged macrophyte richness and biomass and water transparency sd even though many studies reported that the submerged macrophyte richness and biomass had a positive correlation with water sd hu et al 2008 romo et al 2004 sand jensen et al 2000 although water sd exhibited positive relationship but insignificant with submerged macrophytes characteristics the water quality was improved considering the water tn tp and chl a variation after completion the restoration project yang et al reported that there is a suitable water depth 2 1 m for which it is possible to maximize submerged biomass and the submerged macrophyte biomass could decrease gradually with continuously increasing water depth yang et al 2019 this could be due to the water depth of west lake mean value of depth is 1 67 0 41 m being lower than that in the other lakes located in yangtze river where in some sections the lakebed can be seen meanwhile the water depth has not been the primary limiting condition when submerged macrophytes can obtain adequate light results of the rda between the submerged macrophyte coverage and environmental factors indicated that water tn no3 n no2 n and ph and sediment orp and tn were the main factors determining the submerged macrophyte distribution this result implies that water nutrients have a stronger influence than sediment nutrient on submerged macrophytes consistent with previous studies kuntz et al 2014 xing et al 2013 in this study the mean values of sediment tn and tp were 5 94 2 54 and 2 03 0 62 mg g 1 respectively much greater than the sediment tn and tp 2 03 and 0 56 mg g 1 respectively of the lakes located in yangtze river this result illustrated that sediment nutrient could not influence the submerged macrophyte distribution in addition the coverage of myriophyllum spicatum was positively correlated to the water tn and no3 n whereas it was negatively correlated to the sediment tn however the coverage of hydrilla verticillata vallisneria natans and potamogeton maackianus exhibited contrary results this result could be attributed to the fact that myriophyllum spicatum is a canopy type submerged macrophyte as opposed to hydrilla verticillata vallisneria natans and potamogeton maackianus obtaining nutrients from a water column higher than the sediment on the contrary benthic submerged macrophytes especially vallisneria natans have developed a root system that can obtain more nutrients from the sediment the dominance of these four species of submerged macrophytes in west lake could be due to the high stoichiometric homeostasis coefficients of p of these four species which tends to lead to a more stable regime su et al 2019 the largest distribution of vallisneria natans may be due to the facts that vallisneria natans can compensate substantial leaf tissue as it suffers partial loss and this ability is enhanced when the sediment is at a high nutrient level this also explained the coexistence of vallisneria natans with herbivores especially in freshwater ecosystems li et al 2010 5 conclusion water parameters and sediment properties of west lake exhibited significant differences with respect to location and season the differences in the water physical parameters codcr and tp in water were ascribed to seasonal changes whereas the differences in the water tn was attributed to the different land use type of each watershed section moreover the differences in the sediment properties were due to the season changes and flow field of west lake this research builds upon the successful implementation of the submerged macrophyte restoration of west lake along with the propagation of submerged macrophytes after the ecological engineering was carried out submerged macrophytes can improve water quality and keep the clear water status in particular the largest submerged macrophyte distribution was exhibited in maojiabu which has grown into stable communities compared with the other sections results of the research illustrated that the gradual increase in the submerged macrophytes communities can enhance the ecological functions that govern the water nutrient concentrations nh4 n tn and tp sustainably decreasing and maintaining the clear state of the water meanwhile the water nutrient concentration has a stronger influence than the sediment nutrient concentration on the submerged macrophyte distribution based on its characteristics including a developed root system high stoichiometric homeostasis coefficients of p and the compensation ability of the substantial leaf tissue vallisneria natans has become the dominant species of west lake however the sediment chemical properties tn tp and om exhibit an increasing trend with the restoration of the submerged macrophytes in west lake especially tn this point implies that the gradually developing submerged macrophyte communities can accelerate the accumulation of sediment nutrient and merely establishing the submerged macrophytes communities is largely insufficient in aquatic ecological rehabilitation to ensure the stability of the aquatic ecosystem after performing the submerged macrophyte restoration a greater emphasis must be placed on reestablishing the entire ecosystem including the restoration of aquatic animals and fish stocks declaration of competing
