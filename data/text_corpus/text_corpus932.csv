4660,boreal river systems globally provide specialized habitats and conduits for the transfer of nutrients iron and trace elements tes from wetlands and groundwaters to lakes and oceans many large boreal rivers are also the site of controversy due to their dual purpose providing ecosystem services for indigenous peoples and supporting industrial activity however water quality monitoring in these systems is more complex than realized this work demonstrates the impacts of delayed tributary mixing in a typical large boreal river on the properties and transport of fe bearing colloids and water quality monitoring in two subsequent autumns the forms and concentrations of fe colloids were conserved through the mixing zone for more than 100 km despite salinity changes delayed mixing for ca 60 80 and more than 100 km led to te concentration differences of more than five fold across the river using traditional samples from the middle of the river the coincidence of mixing zones with areas of potential industrial impact obscured the potential contributions of some tes and caused the erroneous attribution of other tes to industry at concentrations that were double upstream values adequate water quality monitoring and source attribution in large boreal rivers thus requires high resolution spatial sampling both across the river and upstream downstream of potential natural and industrial sources since mixing behavior and water quality in large boreal rivers are highly sensitive to hydrologic changes such as seasonal fluctuations drought floods and climate change fluctuations in water quality and associated mixing behaviours render traditional monitoring approaches unsuitable keywords athabasca river climate change colloids field flow fractionation large river confluences trace elements 1 introduction the boreal forest is the largest terrestrial biome in the world and contains more wetlands than any other region these bogs fens marshes and swamps are estimated to constitute over 20 of the land area in canadian boreal forests and up to 28 in the russian taiga ncasi 2007 terenteva et al 2017 many boreal wetlands release large quantities of dissolved organic matter dom iron fe and associated trace elements tes into surrounding rivers through the discharge of waters received from precipitation uplands and groundwaters indeed heightened releases of dom and fe from these wetlands have been recently observed at the global scale causing an increased browning of boreal freshwaters freeman et al 2004 kritzberg and ekström 2012 björnerås et al 2017 these releases can have marked impacts on downstream water quality by limiting the depth of light penetration and providing elevated levels of both nutrients and potentially toxic tes that impact the richness distributions and survival of various aquatic species shotyk 1987 vuori 1995 rice et al 2008 the formation of carcinogenic disinfection byproducts also poses challenges for the treatment of these waters reckhow et al 1990 because dom associated fe particles are resistant to agglomeration and sedimentation under high salinity conditions greater releases of this growth limiting nutrient from boreal rivers will increase the growth of potentially harmful algae blooms when delivered to oceans pokrovsky and schott 2002 silver et al 2010 trick et al 2010 krachler et al 2016 herzog et al 2017 laglera et al 2019 the majority of research into the transport of fe bearing colloids from wetlands to oceans has focused on their properties and behaviour at the point of origin in wetlands or permafrost zones during immediate release into small streams and lakes or in estuaries however the transport of fe bearing colloids is also controlled by several processes in rivers including 1 agglomeration to form particulates caused by photodegradation biodegradation changing physicochemical conditions and brownian coagulation and 2 the sedimentation of particulates caused by decreasing flow velocity farley and morel 1986 filella and buffle 1993 oleinikova et al 2017a 2017b hence the behaviour of these fe bearing colloids during transport through rivers is also critical the agglomeration and sedimentation of fe bearing colloids may occur abruptly in areas where physicochemical conditions change such as the mixing of fe laden tributaries with larger mainstem flows the number of particles and colloids may also change at confluences increasing the number of collisions and amplifying the role of brownian coagulation buffle and leppard 1995 stordal et al 1996 these changes can lead to the loss of organic matter fe and other elements during mixing aucour et al 2003 mora et al 2016 on the other hand the size and surface properties of some fe bearing colloids could limit interactions and agglomeration leading to more conservative transport and mixing baalousha 2009 krachler et al 2010 indeed the size based distribution of fe amongst different colloidal forms controls its transport through estuaries during mixing with the sea transport is conservative for dom associated fe that is ca 3 nm whereas approximately 80 of the primarily inorganic and larger fe oxyhydroxides are removed by agglomeration and settling stolpe and hassellöv 2007 krachler et al 2010 kritzberg et al 2014 the behavior of dom is also broadly conservative in boreal and subarctic estuaries pokrovsky et al 2014 a better understanding of the properties and behaviour of fe bearing colloids during the mixing of dom and fe laden tributaries with large boreal rivers is therefore needed to determine its role in limiting or enhancing the transport of fe and associated tes from their origins to the ocean mixing behaviour is also an important consideration for monitoring water quality in large rivers that are potentially impacted by industry particularly when the mixing zone coincides with the region of potential contamination depending on the location where samples are collected anthropogenic te contributions may be either masked by or associated with concentration gradients that are caused by the delayed mixing of tributaries e g weigold and baborowski 2009 in large boreal rivers and elsewhere the delayed mixing of fe laden tributaries for distances of more than 450 km has been observed mackay 1969 beltaos 1979 aucour et al 2003 however fluctuations in mixing distances from as long as 400 km to as little as 8 km have also been observed in non boreal rivers lane et al 2008 hence effective water quality monitoring in rivers with delayed mixing behaviour requires the concomitant assessment of mixing processes a combination of natural and typically conservative geochemical tracers such as ca cl k mg na so4 2 and sr can be useful indicators of mixing processes when the two sources have distinct chemical signatures e g aucour et al 2003 when the time required for mixing is less than that required for alteration due to biogeochemical and physical processes and there is a measurable difference in te concentrations the list of such quasi conservative tracers may also be extended to include tes that are present in relatively inert anionic forms such as mo as molybdate moo4 2 and re as rhenate reo4 indeed using combinations of such natural tracers and tes may be especially useful in areas where traditionally conservative tracers like na and cl are rendered ineffective by influxes of saline groundwater comparing the transport behaviour of these tracers with different forms of fe bearing colloids in the confluences and downstream reaches of large boreal rivers will thus shed light on both the impacts of mixing on fe transport and the contributions of natural sources in areas that may be impacted by industrial processes similarly measuring changes in the distribution of fe amongst different sizes and colloidal forms in confluences and downstream reaches will provide valuable information about their potentially different transport behaviours as an exemplar for large boreal rivers around the world this study reports on the use of a range of natural geochemical tracers tes and dissolved fe to demonstrate delayed mixing and assess the mixing distance of fe laden tributaries in the athabasca river in alberta canada multivariate analysis is used to more clearly identify endmembers and limit noise from multiple source inputs by extracting the associated latent variables asymmetric flow field flow fractionation af4 coupled to icp ms is used to measure the impacts of mixing on different forms of dissolved 0 45 μm iron bearing colloids the implications for water quality and monitoring are highlighted by comparing water composition flow rates and mixing behaviours between years and their relationships with potential contributions from natural and industrial te sources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling design the study area was a 110 km stretch of the lower athabasca river ar located in the boreal zone of alberta canada figs 1 and s1 the ar is a typical boreal river system with multiple groundwater and wetland fed tributaries containing elevated concentrations of organic matter and iron at concentrations 5 20 times higher than the ar upstream of tributary inputs and industry however the flow rates of most tributaries are 1 of the ar and so make negligible contributions thereto cuss et al 2018 on the other hand the horse river hr and clearwater river clr deliver darker waters to the ar with especially high loads of fe table 1 figs 1 and s1 these waters lead to visibly striking mixing zones in the relatively milky ar which has a sediment load approximately ten times higher than the clr figure s1 conly 2001 delayed mixing for distances greater than 100 times the width at the confluence can be expected for the clr given the state of variables that are known to influence mixing behavior in a variety of rivers low angle of intersection with the ar similar bed heights and velocities and the large width depth ratio of the ar rutherford 1994 gaudet and roy 1995 parsons et al 2008 these mixing conditions may be more common than usually realized in large boreal rivers mackay 1969 river flow rates were estimated using data from historical records hr or averaged over the study period oct 5 17 2017 and sept 25 oct 3 2018 using real time flow rate data obtained from the government of canada ar clr eccc 2020 average flow rates for major and minor tributaries are provided in figs 1 and 2 additional information about the study area and the variables governing mixing distances are provided in the supplementary information si the ar is also in contact with area groundwaters which make known contributions to terrain conductivity however the extent and locations of their penetration through the hyporheic zone to contribute to the ar are primarily downstream of the industrial zone and potentially vary with differences in the relative hydraulic heads gibson et al 2016 gue et al 2018 birks et al 2018 this area of the ar has been the focus of intense water quality monitoring and environmental concern due to its cultural and economic importance for first nations and potentially harmful te contributions from bitumen mining and upgrading kelly et al 2010 guéguen et al 2016 javed et al 2017 landis et al 2017 shotyk et al 2017 donner et al 2018 gopalapillai et al 2019 sinnatamby et al 2019 samples were collected at five cross river transects in the autumn baseflow periods of 2017 and 2018 and along mixing zones of the hr and clr figs 1 and s1 transects were strategically located at five points upstream beside and downstream of major potential sources 1 bracketing the inflows of the hr and clr t1 and t2 2 upstream beside and downstream of industrial operations t2 t3 and t4 and 3 upstream and downstream of a region where high terrain conductivity increases due to inputs of saline groundwater t4 and t5 samples were collected at the east side middle and west side of each transect and at three depths for each location when waters were sufficiently deep 0 3 m from the surface and bottom of the water column and in the middle samples were collected at the same locations 13 m in 2017 and 2018 as located using global positioning satellite gps mixing zone samples were collected at the east shore and in the middle of the river either from the middle of the water column or 0 3 m from the top and bottom where the depth was sufficient samples were collected along the hr mixing zone in both years and along the clr transect in 2018 2 2 ultraclean equipment sample collection and analysis ultraclean metal free supplies cleaning and sample handling were used to minimize the risk of contamination throughout this work all bottles filters syringes and tubing were acid cleaned and packaged in a class 100 air cabinet or clean room samples were syringe filtered through a 0 45 µm membrane on site immediately after collection a portion of each sample was immediately filtered into a pp bottle and acidified for the subsequent measurement of dissolved te concentrations using icp ms another portion of each sample was immediately filtered into an fep teflon bottle to minimize adsorption during the two weeks of storage prior to analysis using af4 icpms the fep bottle was also conditioned with 5 10 ml of filtered sample after filtration each bottle was resealed in its individual ziploc bag which was in turn sealed inside the larger bag for the sample site and stored in a cooler with ice packs for transport to the laboratory special procedures were used to minimize filtration artefacts shiller 2003 the term dissolved is thus used operationally referring to the fraction of material that has passed through the filter in this fashion complete information about cleaning filtration sampling procedures and equipment is provided in the si dissolved te concentrations were analyzed using a

differences between the concentrations of dissolved fe doc and natural geochemical tracers in the clr and hr compared to upstream on the ar i e at site t1 table 1 the concentration of dissolved fe was 5 7 times higher in the clr compared to the ar and 10 16 times higher in the hr chloride concentrations were also ten times higher in the clr compared to the ar but were less than twice as high in the hr the concentration of doc was significantly higher in the hr compared to the ar in both years i e t1 however the concentration of doc in the clr was only significantly higher than the ar in 2018 table 1 on the contrary the concentrations of ca k mg and s were significantly lower in the tributaries in both years with the exception of k in the hr in 2017 while the ph was similar for the ar and tributaries in each year the conductivity of the ar was significantly higher in both 2017 and 2018 176 3 and 155 6 µs cm 1 vs 124 1 and 95 8 µs cm 1 for the clr and 125 1 and 87 µs cm 1 for the hr moving downstream the dark waters from the influx of the hr and clr were visibly distinct from the ar for up to 30 km from satellite figure s1 the concentrations of fe and cl that would be expected downstream at site t5 in the ar assuming a hydrological balance between the main stem and the tributaries with conservative mixing and transport were calculated using the mean flow rates and concentrations of the ar upstream t1 hr and clr for each year fig 2 in both 2017 and 2018 the concentration of fe slowly decreased on the east side of the ar while increasing in the middle and on the west side consistent with dilution processes during mixing figures s3 s5 in 2017 the gradient of low to high fe and cl concentrations from the west to east side of the ar was still measured approximately 80 km downstream from the clr however the chloride concentration had increased beyond the value predicted by assuming complete conservative mixing at some point between t3 and t4 and again at t5 hence cl cannot be considered a reliable indicator of mixing processes downstream of t3 on the other hand the concentrations of ca k mg and s remained at least slightly lower on the east side of the river for more than 100 km fig 3 the concentration of dissolved fe was 108 4 µg l 1 at t5 in agreement with the 110 µg l 1 expected from the complete conservative mixing of inputs from the clr and hr in 2018 the concentrations of dissolved fe cl ca k mg and s on the east side and middle of the river also demonstrated clear mixing behavior along the 25 km clr mixing transect and beyond this for the cross river transects figs 2 3 s4 and s5 a single source of cl and fe was strongly suggested by their constant ratio in the clr mixing transect with highly linear increases and decreases in concentration in the middle and east side of the ar respectively r2 0 99 however the east west concentration gradient was not widely apparent for fe cl or the other tracers 80 km downstream at t4 indeed at t3 only 30 km downstream of the clr the mean cl concentration on the west side of the ar was already higher than expected from complete conservative mixing i e point t3 in fig 2 at the same time the concentration of fe on the west side of t3 88 5 µg l 1 was only half way between the concentration upstream on the ar 56 1 µg l 1 and the concentration expected from complete conservative mixing 119 µg l 1 this marked departure from a constant cl fe ratio indicated a second source of cl on the west side of the ar at some point between 20 and 30 km downstream of the clr figs 2 and s5 on the west side of t4 and t5 the concentrations of both dissolved fe and cl exceeded the values calculated from complete conservative mixing i e 4 9 mg l 1 and 119 µg l 1 respectively the mean concentrations of cl on the west side of the ar were 8 2 0 0 mg l 1 at t4 and 14 3 0 1 mg l 1 at t5 while the mean concentration of dissolved fe was 137 4 µg l 1 on the west side of t4 and remained unchanged at t5 133 2 µg l 1 hence the observed increases in cl concentration between t3 and t5 were not associated with increasing concentrations of fe in 2017 or 2018 concentrations of ca cl mg and s were significantly higher upstream on the ar at t1 in 2018 compared to 2017 table 1 and tended to remain higher downstream to t5 fig 3 the mean downstream concentration of fe was also significantly higher in 2018 compared to 2017 i e 132 1 vs 108 4 µg l 1 at t5 even though the upstream concentration of fe was significantly lower fig 3 on the other hand the downstream concentrations of doc and k were significantly p 0 05 lower in 2018 compared to 2017 reflecting differences in upstream concentrations 8 9 0 1 vs 13 1 0 6 mg l 1 and 1 24 0 01 vs 1 65 0 03 mg l 1 respectively 3 2 forms of fe bearing colloids in both 2017 and 2018 dissolved fe colloids were primarily present in organic o fe and inorganic i fe forms in the surface of the water column at site t1 in the clr and in the hr figs 4 and s2 however concentrations of o fe and especially i fe were much higher in the hr and the clr compared to t1 o fe 40 95 and 10 13 µg l 1 in the hr and clr vs 4 12 µg l 1 in the ar i fe 387 486 and 183 193 µg l 1 in the hr and clr vs 32 39 µg l 1 in the ar respectively hence i fe was the primary colloidal form of dissolved fe that was contributed to the ar by these tributaries the downstream mixing behaviour of dissolved fe colloids differed in 2017 and 2018 mirroring the behavior of overall dissolved fe concentrations in each year figs 2 4 s3 and s5 in 2017 the concentration of i fe on the east side of the ar tripled from 33 2 to 106 µg l 1 between t1 and t2 on the other hand the concentration of i fe remained unchanged on the west side of t2 and increased only slightly to 41 µg l 1 in the middle as expected from the east side influence of the clr and hr moving downstream the distribution of i fe continued to follow the pattern of delayed mixing evident for dissolved fe and retained the east to west gradient at t4 however the i fe concentration at t5 was slightly elevated compared to the value expected from complete conservative mixing i e 69 4 vs 59 µg l 1 in 2018 the concentration of i fe at t2 was also much higher on the east side compared to upstream on the ar i e 164 vs 36 4 µg l 1 fig 4 the delayed mixing of i fe across the river was again observed downstream in 2018 but concentrations became similar on all sides at t4 81 3 µg l 1 and remaining unchanged at t5 79 6 µg l 1 importantly this means that there was no measurable increase in the concentration of either dissolved fe or i fe between t4 and t5 in 2018 despite a near doubling in the concentration of chloride figs 2 s5 this also suggests a shorter mixing distance for i fe in 2018 mirroring the behaviour of dissolved fe and other tracers the concentrations of i fe at t4 and t5 were also slightly elevated compared to the value expected from conservative mixing i e 70 µg l 1 in both 2017 and 2018 the concentration of o fe increased substantially on the east side of t2 in the outflow of the clr 4 11 and 12 18 µg l 1 respectively other changes were relatively minor but generally resembled the patterns observed for i fe from upstream to downstream and across the ar such that o fe tended to decrease on the east side downstream between t2 and t5 and tended to increase on the west side and in the middle figs 4 s2 the concentration of o fe was significantly higher at t5 in 2017 compared to 2018 11 1 2 6 vs 7 0 0 7 µg l 1 whereas the concentration of i fe was higher in 2018 69 4 vs 79 6 µg l 1 these annual differences mirror those observed for doc and dissolved fe table 1 fig 2 3 3 trace elements and multivariate analysis the variable mixing behaviour of the clr and hr in 2017 and 2018 was also apparent from the trends in te concentrations from upstream to downstream on different sides of the ar figs 5 and s6 three broad trends were observed 3 3 1 tributary contributions vs dilutions the concentrations of many tes of environmental concern were lower in the clr and hr compared to the ar with trends that were similar to the tracers this resulted in the dilution of concentrations in the ar e g cd cu ni sb tl and u the concentrations of some other tes were higher in the clr and hr resulting in increasing trends similar to fe and cl e g ce la mn nd 3 3 2 fast vs delayed mixing in 2018 the changing concentration of many tes on the east side of the ar described an arc wherein the concentration either increased or decreased at the outlet of the clr and then rapidly changed direction to approach similar concentrations on the west side of the ar at t3 becoming very similar or the same at t4 and t5 e g cu mo ni sr and u this mixing behavior was independent of the form of the tes since elements expected in mainly ionic forms mo sr behaved similarly to those which are expected in dom associated colloidal forms cu ni this arc and approach were not as pronounced in 2017 however such that the concentrations of most tes were still lower on the east side of t5 these patterns were generally shared by fe i fe and all tracers except for cl figs 2 4 s6 3 3 3 midstream additions the concentrations of several tes increased markedly on the west side of the river from lower values at t1 to higher concentrations at two or more locations downstream to t5 despite lower concentrations on the east side from tributary inputs e g ce cu v la nd ni pb tl figs 5 and s6 this pattern was more pronounced in 2017 and increases were sustained further downstream for some tes the patterns of change from upstream to downstream on the different sides of the ar suggested the occurrence of more than one of these behaviours for example the pattern of concentration change from upstream to downstream suggested that tes which were contributed by tributaries also received midstream additions between t2 and t4 e g ce la nd and pb principal component analysis pca was applied to better assess mixing behaviour by extricating the latent variables behind these correlates which may represent different source inputs fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 multivariate analysis remarkably the scores of all three pcs were significantly different p 0 05 for the samples that were collected on the east side of the clr mixing transect compared to those that were collected in the middle of the ar at every point along the entire 25 km of this transect figures s1 and s7 this demonstrates the pervasive influence of the combined clr and hr inputs on the water quality in this system however each pc also indicated other source signatures in addition to doc fe and mn as indicators for the clr and hr the other positive loadings on the measured rees and relatively immobile tes like pb and ga in principal component 1 pc1 are indicative of sediment and dusts more positive scores loadings in contrast to negative loadings on ca so4 2 mg and u which were higher in the ar upstream more negative the high positive loadings on mo ni re and v in pc2 along with other dust associated tes like ca k mg ba cd cu sb and tl served to indicate midstream additions of bitumen and dust associated tes more positive scores this contrasts with negative loadings on cl na fe and mn which are indicative of the clr and hr more negative scores on pc2 negative loadings on doc k v re and cl in pc3 serve to indicate the influence of previously identified re bearing saline groundwaters shotyk et al 2017 and the clr hr inputs more negative scores in contrast to lower salinity upstream waters on the ar with higher concentrations of so4 2 sr ba and u positive loadings the interpretation of pcs and associated results are further detailed in the supplementary information 4 2 mixing distance the behaviours of tracers ca k mg so4 2 i fe tes and pcs in this study provided consistent indications of mixing distance in 2017 mixing was not yet fully complete 80 km downstream from the clr and may not have been complete for over 100 km this is evident from the persistently lower east side concentrations of ca k mg so4 2 and most tes that had lower concentrations in the clr and hr figs 3 5 s6 scores on the latent mixing variable pc2 also remained significantly p 0 05 lower on the east side and middle of the ar at t4 and t5 fig 6 given the positive loadings on some other elements in pc2 e g mo ni v re it could be objected that these east west differences are also influenced by contributions from bitumen associated tes from e g petroleum coke fugitive dust emissions and saline groundwater in the region from t3 t5 this seems unlikely because 1 dusts and other windblown sources should not be isolated to one side of the river as demonstrated by previous work and the increases in pc1 scores at all points across the river in 2017 from t2 t4 guéguen et al 2016 indeed the strikingly conservative and similar pattern of midstream addition behavior for cu v ni pb tl that are reflected in the positive loadings of pc2 impacted both the east and west sides of the ar in 2017 suggesting a complex dust source spread across the river figs 5 6 s6 2 saline groundwater contributions would have to be isolated to the east side of the ar since chloride had a negative loading on pc2 whereas the dominant inputs of chloride downstream of the clr were from the west side of the river figs 2 s3 s5 and 3 the loading of re was opposite to that of cl on pc2 such that this pc cannot represent ancient saline groundwaters which are suspected to be re enriched shotyk et al 2017 indeed higher cl and lower re concentrations are precisely indicative of the clr signature relative to the ar table 1 fig 5 east side scores on pc2 may have been influenced by inputs from other tributaries on the east side of the ar that have high fe concentrations and te compositions similar to the clr such as the muskeg and steepbank rivers however these inputs were relatively minor and are balanced by similar inputs from the mckay ells and tar rivers on the west side and thus cannot account for east west differences at t4 and t5 fig 1 in 2018 complete mixing of the clr and hr is estimated to have occurred in the range of 60 80 km downstream this mixing distance is shorter than the 94 km required for full i e 98 mixing that was predicted based on tracer addition experiments under ice covered conditions beltaos 1979 herein mixing distance was evidenced by similar concentrations of tracers most tes and i fe concentrations on the east side of t4 compared to the west side and the same or higher concentrations at t5 figs 3 5 and s6 on the other hand the score of pc2 on the east side of t4 was significantly lower p 0 05 compared to the middle and west sides 1 6 vs 1 3 0 2 and 1 2 0 1 respectively the distributions of fe and cl across the ar also suggest complete mixing at or before t4 as do the trajectories of te and tracer concentrations from t1 t3 figs 2 5 and s5 however it should be noted that many of these te concentrations may be influenced by groundwater which had a markedly greater influence on cl concentrations further upstream in 2018 compared to 2017 particularly on the west side of the river fig 2 s3 and s5 the shorter mixing distance for fe in 2018 is especially surprising given the higher concentration of fe and higher flow rates in the clr compared to 2017 and correspondingly lower flow rates in the ar fig 2 this could be caused by a difference in the hydraulic gradient between the ar and groundwater given the lower flow rates of the ar and higher concentrations of chloride the cross currents created by introducing a third source of water at or near confluences may also impact mixing lambs 2004 given the high concentrations of chloride in the clr and suspected groundwater contributions at or near its confluence with the ar further study of the impact of local hydraulic gradients on these mixing processes is needed 4 3 impacts of mixing on fe bearing colloids other than dilution there were no marked impacts of mixing processes on fe bearing colloids from the clr and hr over the 60 100 km of mixing with the ar fig 4 this is unexpected given that confluences are often sites of agglomeration and sedimentation particularly given increasing salinity from saline groundwater inputs however the cl concentration was higher in the clr compared to the ar such that salinity effectively decreased during the mixing of colloids in the clr outflow into the ar it could also be expected that bio and photo degradation processes may transform these colloids during travel over this distance e g oleinikova et al 2017a oleinikova et al 2017b however the impacts of these processes were likely limited due to the low light penetration caused by high turbidity deep waters and a relatively short transport time of ca 18 24 h between t1 and t5 estimated from average velocity measured with each surface sample the most remarkable change in colloidal fe was the elevated concentration of i fe at t4 or t5 by 10 15 above that expected from conservative mixing these changes cannot be attributed to saline groundwaters because no increases in the concentrations of either i fe or dissolved fe were observed between t4 and t5 in 2018 despite a near doubling in chloride concentration fisg 2 4 s5 being relatively small increases of 10 µg l 1 this i fe could have been contributed by the steepbank muskeg mckay and ells rivers fig 1 some dissolved phase contributions of fe from dusts are also possible given the positive loading of fe on pc1 and the increasing scores of samples collected between t3 and t5 figure s8 thus both the concentration and distribution of fe amongst various colloidal forms were more or less conserved over 60 100 km of clr hr mixing and transport in both years 4 4 implications for water quality and monitoring concentrations of cl doc fe o fe and i fe were significantly different in mixing endmembers and downstream reaches in 2017 compared to 2018 as were the concentrations of other tracers and numerous tes these downstream changes were largely caused by the mixing of the clr with the ar which has been assessed as the largest influence on water quality in the ar under winter low flow conditions tondu 2017 the mixing distance of these rivers also differed by ca 20 40 km between the two years this behavior creates several challenges for water quality monitoring along this river and others with similar mixing behavior downstream concentration differences broadly reflected the differences in flow rates and relative contributions of endmembers and other sources as identified in the pcs higher scores on pc1 in 2017 suggest a greater influence from natural sediments dusts and doc especially at t3 and t4 figs 2 5 6 s6 s8 scores on pc2 were consistently lower in 2018 due to the greater influence of cl and the clr and less influence from bitumen associated tes and other elements potentially contributed by petroleum coke and natural dusts the interpretation of pc3 loadings and scores challenges this otherwise straightforward analysis because it primarily distinguished samples by year without clear links to specific sources figure s8 curiously cl concentrations tended to be higher in 2018 and cl had a negative loading on pc3 but scores in 2018 were considerably higher than in 2017 however loadings were also negative for cu v re and k for which concentrations were clearly higher in 2017 figs 3 and 5 rhenium has been connected to inputs from ancient saline groundwaters that may enter the ar in areas beginning slightly downstream of t3 which is suggested in both years figs 5 and s8 shotyk et al 2017 hence greater influence from doc inputs of dusts containing cu v and k at t3 and re bearing groundwaters contributed to the distribution of pc3 scores in 2017 and 2018 figs 3 5 and s6 however in both years the concentration of re consistently decreased between t4 and t5 despite increasing salinity suggesting that saline inputs did not contribute significant re downstream of t4 sulfate has also been connected to saline inputs from devonian groundwaters but so4 2 had the highest loading opposite to cl and re on pc3 waters originating in quaternary aquifers contain elevated levels of so4 2 ba mo sr and u and relatively low cl compared to other area groundwaters birks et al 2018 this correlation structure is described both by pc3 and the relative concentrations of these elements suggesting that waters with lower salinity exerted greater influence on the ar beginning further upstream in 2018 particularly on the west side of the ar between t1 and t2 figures s5 and s8 assuming that monitoring samples are collected at the surface in the middle of the river these fluctuations in water quality and associated mixing behaviours render standard monitoring approaches unsuitable for detecting industrial inputs for example consider the impacts of the observed mixing behaviour on fe in 2017 given the coincidence of the mixing zone with the area of industrial operations the mean concentrations of fe 95 ci in the middle of the upstream t1 t2 industry associated t3 and downstream section t4 t5 of the ar were 75 8 143 33 and 106 6 µg l 1 figure s3 without considering the clr and hr mixing zone this trend suggests a significant impact from industry similar trends are apparent for other tes with higher concentrations in the clr including ce mn la and nd figs 5 and s6 on the other hand the concentration of a range of bitumen and dust associated tes were diluted by the clr such that their mid river t3 t4 concentrations do not appear to increase in the middle despite clear trends of increase on the west side for example consider the apparently insignificant changes in ni from upstream to downstream 0 89 0 03 0 85 0 04 and 0 90 0 01 µg l 1 and in cu 0 74 0 04 0 68 0 06 and 0 91 0 31 µg l 1 compared to the east and west side trends fig 5 besides creating or masking these trends mixing processes also confound the detection of significant changes at high confidence levels by introducing variation hence collecting samples at high spatial resolution from upstream to downstream at multiple points across the river is recommended to track and account for this mixing behavior since the bed height discordance bed morphology width depth ratio and other variables that govern mixing behavior are constant for the confluence of the ar and the clr and transport behavior is approximately conservative their momentum ratio exerts a primary influence on mixing behavior and hence concentrations at each point across the river in principle and assuming that the ar and the clr are the primary sources of tes the ratio of their discharges may thus be useful for estimating their mixing behavior this ratio is a primary component of the momentum ratio mr qar uar ρar qclr uclr ρclr where q is the flow rate u is the section averaged downstream velocity and ρ is the density indeed mr is frequently included in studies of the variables that control mixing behavior at large river confluences e g boyer et al 2006 lane et al 2008 baronas et al 2017 the value of this ratio corresponded with the relative concentrations of fe tracers and trace elements at t5 for both years in this study as expected from conservative mixing but not with the mixing distances i e qar qclr 9 1 and 7 4 for fe 108 and 132 µg l 1 for mixing distances of greater than 100 and 60 80 km respectively figs 3 s3 s5 however the densities averaged velocities and complete morphology of the river bed at the confluence were not measured and other variables such as sediment load density differences and turbulence may also affect mixing behavior boyer et al 2006 lane et al 2008 hence the measurement of these variables and trace element concentrations under numerous flow conditions is recommended to provide a useful indication of the value of qar qclr and mr as predictors for downstream concentrations across the river and associated mixing behavior since the mixing behavior of the ar clr and groundwater inputs are prone to change under different annual and seasonal hydrologic conditions it is recommended that the associated impacts on downstream water quality across the river be determined at the time of sampling in the absence of demonstrated predictive capability the detection and quantification of industrial contributions and hence the protection of this and other large boreal rivers therefore requires high resolution spatial sampling high quality analysis and advanced statistical methods to account for the potential influences of multiple sources it is in large part the low noise provided by reliable and reproducible metal free sampling and analytical methods that has enabled the detection of endmember profiles and variable mixing behaviour specifically the capability of reliably measuring very low concentrations with correlated fluctuations which are frequently in the single digit ng l 1 range have greatly improved the ability of multivariate analysis to detect and resolve the stable correlation structures underlying endmembers throughout the mixing process these fluctuations may otherwise be obscured by noise from contamination or unreliable analyses hence trace element sampling and analysis methods are recommended for assessing mixing behavior advanced monitoring technologies could be used to optimize sample site locations and provide additional information about relationships between flow rates and mixing length for example indicators of channel cross sectional variation could be developed using a turbidimeter or doppler flow velocity depth profiles this equipment is expensive and may have limited utility due to the high width depth ratio 300 900 m vs thalweg depth of 2 6 m the corresponding dispersion of flow across the river and the changing location of the thalweg and flow paths following the passage of spring ice floes however it could be useful for better characterizing the relationships between flow and mixing during periods when these conditions are stable the detection of small differences in dissolved concentration and speciation at the trace and ultra trace levels may also be obscured by natural diel cycles particularly in small streams and lakes reviewed by nimick et al 2011 this is especially true for tes and species that are easily impacted by temperature changes or minor fluctuations in ph and dissolved gas concentrations however recent work in other large boreal rivers has found that these diel variations amounted to 10 rsd vorobyev et al 2019 chupakov et al 2020 this is comparable to the level of variation measured at t1 since each transect requires 4 6 h to collect and filter all nine samples e g fe t1 67 0 2 1 µg l 1 doc 13 4 0 9 mg l 1 in 2017 table 1 these variations are low relative to the 5 fold differences in concentration observed for some te across the ar at t2 fig 5 this lack of sensitivity could be due to the resistance of large rivers to some diel changes owing to the larger volume of water and associated mixing of multiple source inputs however further investigation is recommended 5 conclusions and future directions given the observed conservative mixing and transport behavior of fe bearing colloids in the ar downstream concentrations of these colloids and associated tes will increase in step with local exports from wetlands and groundwaters while recent global increases in the browning of boreal rivers has thus likely increased the transport of these colloids to downstream reaches their delivery to the ocean requires transport through other areas with changing conditions that may impact their stability such as lower flows potentially causing sedimentation in deltas hence the size based behavior of fe bearing colloids in the freshwater deltas of large boreal rivers requires additional investigation e g the peace athabasca delta a unesco world heritage site where the ar merges with the peace river and enters lake athabasca delayed and inconsistent source contributions and mixing behaviour in large boreal river systems can produce considerable errors in source attribution during water quality monitoring such errors may result in the inadequate protection of these sensitive and valuable resources or the overregulation of industry hence water quality monitoring in large boreal rivers like the ar requires high resolution spatial sampling if appropriate methods are used to minimize the risk of sample contamination during collection and analysis the measurement of multiple natural geochemical tracers dissolved tes and the distribution of these tes amongst colloidal forms can be applied to effectively assess these mixing processes and source contributions the observed mixing rates and source inputs to the ar and other boreal systems with complex input profiles will differ with season and in response to other changes impacting local hydraulic gradients such as periods of drought floods and climate change given the sensitive nature of boreal systems minor changes in local hydrology may have disproportionately large impacts on the contributions of various sources altering both the salinity of waters and exports of fe and organic matter the resulting changes and instabilities in water quality may threaten the health of downstream ecosystems by altering the habitat or worse producing an unstable habitat heightened or inconsistent exports of fe tes and dom also pose challenges for water treatment as such the responses of large boreal rivers like the ar to these stresses and associated impacts on downstream water quality and ecosystems should be frequently monitored to improve our awareness of potential ecological damage the protection of these ecosystems and associated flow contributions from various sources may be especially important in areas like the lower ar where indigenous communities are directly dependent upon ecosystem services and associated resources the high quality data and improved spatial resolution of the current work have provided a snapshot of the implications of delayed mixing and associated instabilities in large boreal rivers however a complete picture requires

4660,boreal river systems globally provide specialized habitats and conduits for the transfer of nutrients iron and trace elements tes from wetlands and groundwaters to lakes and oceans many large boreal rivers are also the site of controversy due to their dual purpose providing ecosystem services for indigenous peoples and supporting industrial activity however water quality monitoring in these systems is more complex than realized this work demonstrates the impacts of delayed tributary mixing in a typical large boreal river on the properties and transport of fe bearing colloids and water quality monitoring in two subsequent autumns the forms and concentrations of fe colloids were conserved through the mixing zone for more than 100 km despite salinity changes delayed mixing for ca 60 80 and more than 100 km led to te concentration differences of more than five fold across the river using traditional samples from the middle of the river the coincidence of mixing zones with areas of potential industrial impact obscured the potential contributions of some tes and caused the erroneous attribution of other tes to industry at concentrations that were double upstream values adequate water quality monitoring and source attribution in large boreal rivers thus requires high resolution spatial sampling both across the river and upstream downstream of potential natural and industrial sources since mixing behavior and water quality in large boreal rivers are highly sensitive to hydrologic changes such as seasonal fluctuations drought floods and climate change fluctuations in water quality and associated mixing behaviours render traditional monitoring approaches unsuitable keywords athabasca river climate change colloids field flow fractionation large river confluences trace elements 1 introduction the boreal forest is the largest terrestrial biome in the world and contains more wetlands than any other region these bogs fens marshes and swamps are estimated to constitute over 20 of the land area in canadian boreal forests and up to 28 in the russian taiga ncasi 2007 terenteva et al 2017 many boreal wetlands release large quantities of dissolved organic matter dom iron fe and associated trace elements tes into surrounding rivers through the discharge of waters received from precipitation uplands and groundwaters indeed heightened releases of dom and fe from these wetlands have been recently observed at the global scale causing an increased browning of boreal freshwaters freeman et al 2004 kritzberg and ekström 2012 björnerås et al 2017 these releases can have marked impacts on downstream water quality by limiting the depth of light penetration and providing elevated levels of both nutrients and potentially toxic tes that impact the richness distributions and survival of various aquatic species shotyk 1987 vuori 1995 rice et al 2008 the formation of carcinogenic disinfection byproducts also poses challenges for the treatment of these waters reckhow et al 1990 because dom associated fe particles are resistant to agglomeration and sedimentation under high salinity conditions greater releases of this growth limiting nutrient from boreal rivers will increase the growth of potentially harmful algae blooms when delivered to oceans pokrovsky and schott 2002 silver et al 2010 trick et al 2010 krachler et al 2016 herzog et al 2017 laglera et al 2019 the majority of research into the transport of fe bearing colloids from wetlands to oceans has focused on their properties and behaviour at the point of origin in wetlands or permafrost zones during immediate release into small streams and lakes or in estuaries however the transport of fe bearing colloids is also controlled by several processes in rivers including 1 agglomeration to form particulates caused by photodegradation biodegradation changing physicochemical conditions and brownian coagulation and 2 the sedimentation of particulates caused by decreasing flow velocity farley and morel 1986 filella and buffle 1993 oleinikova et al 2017a 2017b hence the behaviour of these fe bearing colloids during transport through rivers is also critical the agglomeration and sedimentation of fe bearing colloids may occur abruptly in areas where physicochemical conditions change such as the mixing of fe laden tributaries with larger mainstem flows the number of particles and colloids may also change at confluences increasing the number of collisions and amplifying the role of brownian coagulation buffle and leppard 1995 stordal et al 1996 these changes can lead to the loss of organic matter fe and other elements during mixing aucour et al 2003 mora et al 2016 on the other hand the size and surface properties of some fe bearing colloids could limit interactions and agglomeration leading to more conservative transport and mixing baalousha 2009 krachler et al 2010 indeed the size based distribution of fe amongst different colloidal forms controls its transport through estuaries during mixing with the sea transport is conservative for dom associated fe that is ca 3 nm whereas approximately 80 of the primarily inorganic and larger fe oxyhydroxides are removed by agglomeration and settling stolpe and hassellöv 2007 krachler et al 2010 kritzberg et al 2014 the behavior of dom is also broadly conservative in boreal and subarctic estuaries pokrovsky et al 2014 a better understanding of the properties and behaviour of fe bearing colloids during the mixing of dom and fe laden tributaries with large boreal rivers is therefore needed to determine its role in limiting or enhancing the transport of fe and associated tes from their origins to the ocean mixing behaviour is also an important consideration for monitoring water quality in large rivers that are potentially impacted by industry particularly when the mixing zone coincides with the region of potential contamination depending on the location where samples are collected anthropogenic te contributions may be either masked by or associated with concentration gradients that are caused by the delayed mixing of tributaries e g weigold and baborowski 2009 in large boreal rivers and elsewhere the delayed mixing of fe laden tributaries for distances of more than 450 km has been observed mackay 1969 beltaos 1979 aucour et al 2003 however fluctuations in mixing distances from as long as 400 km to as little as 8 km have also been observed in non boreal rivers lane et al 2008 hence effective water quality monitoring in rivers with delayed mixing behaviour requires the concomitant assessment of mixing processes a combination of natural and typically conservative geochemical tracers such as ca cl k mg na so4 2 and sr can be useful indicators of mixing processes when the two sources have distinct chemical signatures e g aucour et al 2003 when the time required for mixing is less than that required for alteration due to biogeochemical and physical processes and there is a measurable difference in te concentrations the list of such quasi conservative tracers may also be extended to include tes that are present in relatively inert anionic forms such as mo as molybdate moo4 2 and re as rhenate reo4 indeed using combinations of such natural tracers and tes may be especially useful in areas where traditionally conservative tracers like na and cl are rendered ineffective by influxes of saline groundwater comparing the transport behaviour of these tracers with different forms of fe bearing colloids in the confluences and downstream reaches of large boreal rivers will thus shed light on both the impacts of mixing on fe transport and the contributions of natural sources in areas that may be impacted by industrial processes similarly measuring changes in the distribution of fe amongst different sizes and colloidal forms in confluences and downstream reaches will provide valuable information about their potentially different transport behaviours as an exemplar for large boreal rivers around the world this study reports on the use of a range of natural geochemical tracers tes and dissolved fe to demonstrate delayed mixing and assess the mixing distance of fe laden tributaries in the athabasca river in alberta canada multivariate analysis is used to more clearly identify endmembers and limit noise from multiple source inputs by extracting the associated latent variables asymmetric flow field flow fractionation af4 coupled to icp ms is used to measure the impacts of mixing on different forms of dissolved 0 45 μm iron bearing colloids the implications for water quality and monitoring are highlighted by comparing water composition flow rates and mixing behaviours between years and their relationships with potential contributions from natural and industrial te sources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling design the study area was a 110 km stretch of the lower athabasca river ar located in the boreal zone of alberta canada figs 1 and s1 the ar is a typical boreal river system with multiple groundwater and wetland fed tributaries containing elevated concentrations of organic matter and iron at concentrations 5 20 times higher than the ar upstream of tributary inputs and industry however the flow rates of most tributaries are 1 of the ar and so make negligible contributions thereto cuss et al 2018 on the other hand the horse river hr and clearwater river clr deliver darker waters to the ar with especially high loads of fe table 1 figs 1 and s1 these waters lead to visibly striking mixing zones in the relatively milky ar which has a sediment load approximately ten times higher than the clr figure s1 conly 2001 delayed mixing for distances greater than 100 times the width at the confluence can be expected for the clr given the state of variables that are known to influence mixing behavior in a variety of rivers low angle of intersection with the ar similar bed heights and velocities and the large width depth ratio of the ar rutherford 1994 gaudet and roy 1995 parsons et al 2008 these mixing conditions may be more common than usually realized in large boreal rivers mackay 1969 river flow rates were estimated using data from historical records hr or averaged over the study period oct 5 17 2017 and sept 25 oct 3 2018 using real time flow rate data obtained from the government of canada ar clr eccc 2020 average flow rates for major and minor tributaries are provided in figs 1 and 2 additional information about the study area and the variables governing mixing distances are provided in the supplementary information si the ar is also in contact with area groundwaters which make known contributions to terrain conductivity however the extent and locations of their penetration through the hyporheic zone to contribute to the ar are primarily downstream of the industrial zone and potentially vary with differences in the relative hydraulic heads gibson et al 2016 gue et al 2018 birks et al 2018 this area of the ar has been the focus of intense water quality monitoring and environmental concern due to its cultural and economic importance for first nations and potentially harmful te contributions from bitumen mining and upgrading kelly et al 2010 guéguen et al 2016 javed et al 2017 landis et al 2017 shotyk et al 2017 donner et al 2018 gopalapillai et al 2019 sinnatamby et al 2019 samples were collected at five cross river transects in the autumn baseflow periods of 2017 and 2018 and along mixing zones of the hr and clr figs 1 and s1 transects were strategically located at five points upstream beside and downstream of major potential sources 1 bracketing the inflows of the hr and clr t1 and t2 2 upstream beside and downstream of industrial operations t2 t3 and t4 and 3 upstream and downstream of a region where high terrain conductivity increases due to inputs of saline groundwater t4 and t5 samples were collected at the east side middle and west side of each transect and at three depths for each location when waters were sufficiently deep 0 3 m from the surface and bottom of the water column and in the middle samples were collected at the same locations 13 m in 2017 and 2018 as located using global positioning satellite gps mixing zone samples were collected at the east shore and in the middle of the river either from the middle of the water column or 0 3 m from the top and bottom where the depth was sufficient samples were collected along the hr mixing zone in both years and along the clr transect in 2018 2 2 ultraclean equipment sample collection and analysis ultraclean metal free supplies cleaning and sample handling were used to minimize the risk of contamination throughout this work all bottles filters syringes and tubing were acid cleaned and packaged in a class 100 air cabinet or clean room samples were syringe filtered through a 0 45 µm membrane on site immediately after collection a portion of each sample was immediately filtered into a pp bottle and acidified for the subsequent measurement of dissolved te concentrations using icp ms another portion of each sample was immediately filtered into an fep teflon bottle to minimize adsorption during the two weeks of storage prior to analysis using af4 icpms the fep bottle was also conditioned with 5 10 ml of filtered sample after filtration each bottle was resealed in its individual ziploc bag which was in turn sealed inside the larger bag for the sample site and stored in a cooler with ice packs for transport to the laboratory special procedures were used to minimize filtration artefacts shiller 2003 the term dissolved is thus used operationally referring to the fraction of material that has

differences between the concentrations of dissolved fe doc and natural geochemical tracers in the clr and hr compared to upstream on the ar i e at site t1 table 1 the concentration of dissolved fe was 5 7 times higher in the clr compared to the ar and 10 16 times higher in the hr chloride concentrations were also ten times higher in the clr compared to the ar but were less than twice as high in the hr the concentration of doc was significantly higher in the hr compared to the ar in both years i e t1 however the concentration of doc in the clr was only significantly higher than the ar in 2018 table 1 on the contrary the concentrations of ca k mg and s were significantly lower in the tributaries in both years with the exception of k in the hr in 2017 while the ph was similar for the ar and tributaries in each year the conductivity of the ar was significantly higher in both 2017 and 2018 176 3 and 155 6 µs cm 1 vs 124 1 and 95 8 µs cm 1 for the clr and 125 1 and 87 µs cm 1 for the hr moving downstream the dark waters from the influx of the hr and clr were visibly distinct from the ar for up to 30 km from satellite figure s1 the concentrations of fe and cl that would be expected downstream at site t5 in the ar assuming a hydrological balance between the main stem and the tributaries with conservative mixing and transport were calculated using the mean flow rates and concentrations of the ar upstream t1 hr and clr for each year fig 2 in both 2017 and 2018 the concentration of fe slowly decreased on the east side of the ar while increasing in the middle and on the west side consistent with dilution processes during mixing figures s3 s5 in 2017 the gradient of low to high fe and cl concentrations from the west to east side of the ar was still measured approximately 80 km downstream from the clr however the chloride concentration had increased beyond the value predicted by assuming complete conservative mixing at some point between t3 and t4 and again at t5 hence cl cannot be considered a reliable indicator of mixing processes downstream of t3 on the other hand the concentrations of ca k mg and s remained at least slightly lower on the east side of the river for more than 100 km fig 3 the concentration of dissolved fe was 108 4 µg l 1 at t5 in agreement with the 110 µg l 1 expected from the complete conservative mixing of inputs from the clr and hr in 2018 the concentrations of dissolved fe cl ca k mg and s on the east side and middle of the river also demonstrated clear mixing behavior along the 25 km clr mixing transect and beyond this for the cross river transects figs 2 3 s4 and s5 a single source of cl and fe was strongly suggested by their constant ratio in the clr mixing transect with highly linear increases and decreases in concentration in the middle and east side of the ar respectively r2 0 99 however the east west concentration gradient was not widely apparent for fe cl or the other tracers 80 km downstream at t4 indeed at t3 only 30 km downstream of the clr the mean cl concentration on the west side of the ar was already higher than expected from complete conservative mixing i e point t3 in fig 2 at the same time the concentration of fe on the west side of t3 88 5 µg l 1 was only half way between the concentration upstream on the ar 56 1 µg l 1 and the concentration expected from complete conservative mixing 119 µg l 1 this marked departure from a constant cl fe ratio indicated a second source of cl on the west side of the ar at some point between 20 and 30 km downstream of the clr figs 2 and s5 on the west side of t4 and t5 the concentrations of both dissolved fe and cl exceeded the values calculated from complete conservative mixing i e 4 9 mg l 1 and 119 µg l 1 respectively the mean concentrations of cl on the west side of the ar were 8 2 0 0 mg l 1 at t4 and 14 3 0 1 mg l 1 at t5 while the mean concentration of dissolved fe was 137 4 µg l 1 on the west side of t4 and remained unchanged at t5 133 2 µg l 1 hence the observed increases in cl concentration between t3 and t5 were not associated with increasing concentrations of fe in 2017 or 2018 concentrations of ca cl mg and s were significantly higher upstream on the ar at t1 in 2018 compared to 2017 table 1 and tended to remain higher downstream to t5 fig 3 the mean downstream concentration of fe was also significantly higher in 2018 compared to 2017 i e 132 1 vs 108 4 µg l 1 at t5 even though the upstream concentration of fe was significantly lower fig 3 on the other hand the downstream concentrations of doc and k were significantly p 0 05 lower in 2018 compared to 2017 reflecting differences in upstream concentrations 8 9 0 1 vs 13 1 0 6 mg l 1 and 1 24 0 01 vs 1 65 0 03 mg l 1 respectively 3 2 forms of fe bearing colloids in both 2017 and 2018 dissolved fe colloids were primarily present in organic o fe and inorganic i fe forms in the surface of the water column at site t1 in the clr and in the hr figs 4 and s2 however concentrations of o fe and especially i fe were much higher in the hr and the clr compared to t1 o fe 40 95 and 10 13 µg l 1 in the hr and clr vs 4 12 µg l 1 in the ar i fe 387 486 and 183 193 µg l 1 in the hr and clr vs 32 39 µg l 1 in the ar respectively hence i fe was the primary colloidal form of dissolved fe that was contributed to the ar by these tributaries the downstream mixing behaviour of dissolved fe colloids differed in 2017 and 2018 mirroring the behavior of overall dissolved fe concentrations in each year figs 2 4 s3 and s5 in 2017 the concentration of i fe on the east side of the ar tripled from 33 2 to 106 µg l 1 between t1 and t2 on the other hand the concentration of i fe remained unchanged on the west side of t2 and increased only slightly to 41 µg l 1 in the middle as expected from the east side influence of the clr and hr moving downstream the distribution of i fe continued to follow the pattern of delayed mixing evident for dissolved fe and retained the east to west gradient at t4 however the i fe concentration at t5 was slightly elevated compared to the value expected from complete conservative mixing i e 69 4 vs 59 µg l 1 in 2018 the concentration of i fe at t2 was also much higher on the east side compared to upstream on the ar i e 164 vs 36 4 µg l 1 fig 4 the delayed mixing of i fe across the river was again observed downstream in 2018 but concentrations became similar on all sides at t4 81 3 µg l 1 and remaining unchanged at t5 79 6 µg l 1 importantly this means that there was no measurable increase in the concentration of either dissolved fe or i fe between t4 and t5 in 2018 despite a near doubling in the concentration of chloride figs 2 s5 this also suggests a shorter mixing distance for i fe in 2018 mirroring the behaviour of dissolved fe and other tracers the concentrations of i fe at t4 and t5 were also slightly elevated compared to the value expected from conservative mixing i e 70 µg l 1 in both 2017 and 2018 the concentration of o fe increased substantially on the east side of t2 in the outflow of the clr 4 11 and 12 18 µg l 1 respectively other changes were relatively minor but generally resembled the patterns observed for i fe from upstream to downstream and across the ar such that o fe tended to decrease on the east side downstream between t2 and t5 and tended to increase on the west side and in the middle figs 4 s2 the concentration of o fe was significantly higher at t5 in 2017 compared to 2018 11 1 2 6 vs 7 0 0 7 µg l 1 whereas the concentration of i fe was higher in 2018 69 4 vs 79 6 µg l 1 these annual differences mirror those observed for doc and dissolved fe table 1 fig 2 3 3 trace elements and multivariate analysis the variable mixing behaviour of the clr and hr in 2017 and 2018 was also apparent from the trends in te concentrations from upstream to downstream on different sides of the ar figs 5 and s6 three broad trends were observed 3 3 1 tributary contributions vs dilutions the concentrations of many tes of environmental concern were lower in the clr and hr compared to the ar with trends that were similar to the tracers this resulted in the dilution of concentrations in the ar e g cd cu ni sb tl and u the concentrations of some other tes were higher in the clr and hr resulting in increasing trends similar to fe and cl e g ce la mn nd 3 3 2 fast vs delayed mixing in 2018 the changing concentration of many tes on the east side of the ar described an arc wherein the concentration either increased or decreased at the outlet of the clr and then rapidly changed direction to approach similar concentrations on the west side of the ar at t3 becoming very similar or the same at t4 and t5 e g cu mo ni sr and u this mixing behavior was independent of the form of the tes since elements expected in mainly ionic forms mo sr behaved similarly to those which are expected in dom associated colloidal forms cu ni this arc and approach were not as pronounced in 2017 however such that the concentrations of most tes were still lower on the east side of t5 these patterns were generally shared by fe i fe and all tracers except for cl figs 2 4 s6 3 3 3 midstream additions the concentrations of several tes increased markedly on the west side of the river from lower values at t1 to higher concentrations at two or more locations downstream to t5 despite lower concentrations on the east side from tributary inputs e g ce cu v la nd ni pb tl figs 5 and s6 this pattern was more pronounced in 2017 and increases were sustained further downstream for some tes the patterns of change from upstream to downstream on the different sides of the ar suggested the occurrence of more than one of these behaviours for example the pattern of concentration change from upstream to downstream suggested that tes which were contributed by tributaries also received midstream additions between t2 and t4 e g ce la nd and pb principal component analysis pca was applied to better assess mixing behaviour by extricating the latent variables behind these correlates which may represent different source inputs fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 multivariate analysis remarkably the scores of all three pcs were significantly different p 0 05 for the samples that were collected on the east side of the clr mixing transect compared to those that were collected in the middle of the ar at every point along the entire 25 km of this transect figures s1 and s7 this demonstrates the pervasive influence of the combined clr and hr inputs on the water quality in this system however each pc also indicated other source signatures in addition to doc fe and mn as indicators for the clr and hr the other positive loadings on the measured rees and relatively immobile tes like pb and ga in principal component 1 pc1 are indicative of sediment and dusts more positive scores loadings in contrast to negative loadings on ca so4 2 mg and u which were higher in the ar upstream more negative the high positive loadings on mo ni re and v in pc2 along with other dust associated tes like ca k mg ba cd cu sb and tl served to indicate midstream additions of bitumen and dust associated tes more positive scores this contrasts with negative loadings on cl na fe and mn which are indicative of the clr and hr more negative scores on pc2 negative loadings on doc k v re and cl in pc3 serve to indicate the influence of previously identified re bearing saline groundwaters shotyk et al 2017 and the clr hr inputs more negative scores in contrast to lower salinity upstream waters on the ar with higher concentrations of so4 2 sr ba and u positive loadings the interpretation of pcs and associated results are further detailed in the supplementary information 4 2 mixing distance the behaviours of tracers ca k mg so4 2 i fe tes and pcs in this study provided consistent indications of mixing distance in 2017 mixing was not yet fully complete 80 km downstream from the clr and may not have been complete for over 100 km this is evident from the persistently lower east side concentrations of ca k mg so4 2 and most tes that had lower concentrations in the clr and hr figs 3 5 s6 scores on the latent mixing variable pc2 also remained significantly p 0 05 lower on the east side and middle of the ar at t4 and t5 fig 6 given the positive loadings on some other elements in pc2 e g mo ni v re it could be objected that these east west differences are also influenced by contributions from bitumen associated tes from e g petroleum coke fugitive dust emissions and saline groundwater in the region from t3 t5 this seems unlikely because 1 dusts and other windblown sources should not be isolated to one side of the river as demonstrated by previous work and the increases in pc1 scores at all points across the river in 2017 from t2 t4 guéguen et al 2016 indeed the strikingly conservative and similar pattern of midstream addition behavior for cu v ni pb tl that are reflected in the positive loadings of pc2 impacted both the east and west sides of the ar in 2017 suggesting a complex dust source spread across the river figs 5 6 s6 2 saline groundwater contributions would have to be isolated to the east side of the ar since chloride had a negative loading on pc2 whereas the dominant inputs of chloride downstream of the clr were from the west side of the river figs 2 s3 s5 and 3 the loading of re was opposite to that of cl on pc2 such that this pc cannot represent ancient saline groundwaters which are suspected to be re enriched shotyk et al 2017 indeed higher cl and lower re concentrations are precisely indicative of the clr signature relative to the ar table 1 fig 5 east side scores on pc2 may have been influenced by inputs from other tributaries on the east side of the ar that have high fe concentrations and te compositions similar to the clr such as the muskeg and steepbank rivers however these inputs were relatively minor and are balanced by similar inputs from the mckay ells and tar rivers on the west side and thus cannot account for east west differences at t4 and t5 fig 1 in 2018 complete mixing of the clr and hr is estimated to have occurred in the range of 60 80 km downstream this mixing distance is shorter than the 94 km required for full i e 98 mixing that was predicted based on tracer addition experiments under ice covered conditions beltaos 1979 herein mixing distance was evidenced by similar concentrations of tracers most tes and i fe concentrations on the east side of t4 compared to the west side and the same or higher concentrations at t5 figs 3 5 and s6 on the other hand the score of pc2 on the east side of t4 was significantly lower p 0 05 compared to the middle and west sides 1 6 vs 1 3 0 2 and 1 2 0 1 respectively the distributions of fe and cl across the ar also suggest complete mixing at or before t4 as do the trajectories of te and tracer concentrations from t1 t3 figs 2 5 and s5 however it should be noted that many of these te concentrations may be influenced by groundwater which had a markedly greater influence on cl concentrations further upstream in 2018 compared to 2017 particularly on the west side of the river fig 2 s3 and s5 the shorter mixing distance for fe in 2018 is especially surprising given the higher concentration of fe and higher flow rates in the clr compared to 2017 and correspondingly lower flow rates in the ar fig 2 this could be caused by a difference in the hydraulic gradient between the ar and groundwater given the lower flow rates of the ar and higher concentrations of chloride the cross currents created by introducing a third source of water at or near confluences may also impact mixing lambs 2004 given the high concentrations of chloride in the clr and suspected groundwater contributions at or near its confluence with the ar further study of the impact of local hydraulic gradients on these mixing processes is needed 4 3 impacts of mixing on fe bearing colloids other than dilution there were no marked impacts of mixing processes on fe bearing colloids from the clr and hr over the 60 100 km of mixing with the ar fig 4 this is unexpected given that confluences are often sites of agglomeration and sedimentation particularly given increasing salinity from saline groundwater inputs however the cl concentration was higher in the clr compared to the ar such that salinity effectively decreased during the mixing of colloids in the clr outflow into the ar it could also be expected that bio and photo degradation processes may transform these colloids during travel over this distance e g oleinikova et al 2017a oleinikova et al 2017b however the impacts of these processes were likely limited due to the low light penetration caused by high turbidity deep waters and a relatively short transport time of ca 18 24 h between t1 and t5 estimated from average velocity measured with each surface sample the most remarkable change in colloidal fe was the elevated concentration of i fe at t4 or t5 by 10 15 above that expected from conservative mixing these changes cannot be attributed to saline groundwaters because no increases in the concentrations of either i fe or dissolved fe were observed between t4 and t5 in 2018 despite a near doubling in chloride concentration fisg 2 4 s5 being relatively small increases of 10 µg l 1 this i fe could have been contributed by the steepbank muskeg mckay and ells rivers fig 1 some dissolved phase contributions of fe from dusts are also possible given the positive loading of fe on pc1 and the increasing scores of samples collected between t3 and t5 figure s8 thus both the concentration and distribution of fe amongst various colloidal forms were more or less conserved over 60 100 km of clr hr mixing and transport in both years 4 4 implications for water quality and monitoring concentrations of cl doc fe o fe and i fe were significantly different in mixing endmembers and downstream reaches in 2017 compared to 2018 as were the concentrations of other tracers and numerous tes these downstream changes were largely caused by the mixing of the clr with the ar which has been assessed as the largest influence on water quality in the ar under winter low flow conditions tondu 2017 the mixing distance of these rivers also differed by ca 20 40 km between the two years this behavior creates several challenges for water quality monitoring along this river and others with similar mixing behavior downstream concentration differences broadly reflected the differences in flow rates and relative contributions of endmembers and other sources as identified in the pcs higher scores on pc1 in 2017 suggest a greater influence from natural sediments dusts and doc especially at t3 and t4 figs 2 5 6 s6 s8 scores on pc2 were consistently lower in 2018 due to the greater influence of cl and the clr and less influence from bitumen associated tes and other elements potentially contributed by petroleum coke and natural dusts the interpretation of pc3 loadings and scores challenges this otherwise straightforward analysis because it primarily distinguished samples by year without clear links to specific sources figure s8 curiously cl concentrations tended to be higher in 2018 and cl had a negative loading on pc3 but scores in 2018 were considerably higher than in 2017 however loadings were also negative for cu v re and k for which concentrations were clearly higher in 2017 figs 3 and 5 rhenium has been connected to inputs from ancient saline groundwaters that may enter the ar in areas beginning slightly downstream of t3 which is suggested in both years figs 5 and s8 shotyk et al 2017 hence greater influence from doc inputs of dusts containing cu v and k at t3 and re bearing groundwaters contributed to the distribution of pc3 scores in 2017 and 2018 figs 3 5 and s6 however in both years the concentration of re consistently decreased between t4 and t5 despite increasing salinity suggesting that saline inputs did not contribute significant re downstream of t4 sulfate has also been connected to saline inputs from devonian groundwaters but so4 2 had the highest loading opposite to cl and re on pc3 waters originating in quaternary aquifers contain elevated levels of so4 2 ba mo sr and u and relatively low cl compared to other area groundwaters birks et al 2018 this correlation structure is described both by pc3 and the relative concentrations of these elements suggesting that waters with lower salinity exerted greater influence on the ar beginning further upstream in 2018 particularly on the west side of the ar between t1 and t2 figures s5 and s8 assuming that monitoring samples are collected at the surface in the middle of the river these fluctuations in water quality and associated mixing behaviours render standard monitoring approaches unsuitable for detecting industrial inputs for example consider the impacts of the observed mixing behaviour on fe in 2017 given the coincidence of the mixing zone with the area of industrial operations the mean concentrations of fe 95 ci in the middle of the upstream t1 t2 industry associated t3 and downstream section t4 t5 of the ar were 75 8 143 33 and 106 6 µg l 1 figure s3 without considering the clr and hr mixing zone this trend suggests a significant impact from industry similar trends are apparent for other tes with higher concentrations in the clr including ce mn la and nd figs 5 and s6 on the other hand the concentration of a range of bitumen and dust associated tes were diluted by the clr such that their mid river t3 t4 concentrations do not appear to increase in the middle despite clear trends of increase on the west side for example consider the apparently insignificant changes in ni from upstream to downstream 0 89 0 03 0 85 0 04 and 0 90 0 01 µg l 1 and in cu 0 74 0 04 0 68 0 06 and 0 91 0 31 µg l 1 compared to the east and west side trends fig 5 besides creating or masking these trends mixing processes also confound the detection of significant changes at high confidence levels by introducing variation hence collecting samples at high spatial resolution from upstream to downstream at multiple points across the river is recommended to track and account for this mixing behavior since the bed height discordance bed morphology width depth ratio and other variables that govern mixing behavior are constant for the confluence of the ar and the clr and transport behavior is approximately conservative their momentum ratio exerts a primary influence on mixing behavior and hence concentrations at each point across the river in principle and assuming that the ar and the clr are the primary sources of tes the ratio of their discharges may thus be useful for estimating their mixing behavior this ratio is a primary component of the momentum ratio mr qar uar ρar qclr uclr ρclr where q is the flow rate u is the section averaged downstream velocity and ρ is the density indeed mr is frequently included in studies of the variables that control mixing behavior at large river confluences e g boyer et al 2006 lane et al 2008 baronas et al 2017 the value of this ratio corresponded with the relative concentrations of fe tracers and trace elements at t5 for both years in this study as expected from conservative mixing but not with the mixing distances i e qar qclr 9 1 and 7 4 for fe 108 and 132 µg l 1 for mixing distances of greater than 100 and 60 80 km respectively figs 3 s3 s5 however the densities averaged velocities and complete morphology of the river bed at the confluence were not measured and other variables such as sediment load density differences and turbulence may also affect mixing behavior boyer et al 2006 lane et al 2008 hence the measurement of these variables and trace element concentrations under numerous flow conditions is recommended to provide a useful indication of the value of qar qclr and mr as predictors for downstream concentrations across the river and associated mixing behavior since the mixing behavior of the ar clr and groundwater inputs are prone to change under different annual and seasonal hydrologic conditions it is recommended that the associated impacts on downstream water quality across the river be determined at the time of sampling in the absence of demonstrated predictive capability the detection and quantification of industrial contributions and hence the protection of this and other large boreal rivers therefore requires high resolution spatial sampling high quality analysis and advanced statistical methods to account for the potential influences of multiple sources it is in large part the low noise provided by reliable and reproducible metal free sampling and analytical methods that has enabled the detection of endmember profiles and variable mixing behaviour specifically the capability of reliably measuring very low concentrations with correlated fluctuations which are frequently in the single digit ng l 1 range have greatly improved the ability of multivariate analysis to detect and resolve the stable correlation structures underlying endmembers throughout the mixing process these fluctuations may otherwise be obscured by noise from contamination or unreliable analyses hence trace element sampling and analysis methods are recommended for assessing mixing behavior advanced monitoring technologies could be used to optimize sample site locations and provide additional information about relationships between flow rates and mixing length for example indicators of channel cross sectional variation could be developed using a turbidimeter or doppler flow velocity depth profiles this equipment is expensive and may have limited utility due to the high width depth ratio 300 900 m vs thalweg depth of 2 6 m the corresponding dispersion of flow across the river and the changing location of the thalweg and flow paths following the passage of spring ice floes however it could be useful for better characterizing the relationships between flow and mixing during periods when these conditions are stable the detection of small differences in dissolved concentration and speciation at the trace and ultra trace levels may also be obscured by natural diel cycles particularly in small streams and lakes reviewed by nimick et al 2011 this is especially true for tes and species that are easily impacted by temperature changes or minor fluctuations in ph and dissolved gas concentrations however recent work in other large boreal rivers has found that these diel variations amounted to 10 rsd vorobyev et al 2019 chupakov et al 2020 this is comparable to the level of variation measured at t1 since each transect requires 4 6 h to collect and filter all nine samples e g fe t1 67 0 2 1 µg l 1 doc 13 4 0 9 mg l 1 in 2017 table 1 these variations are low relative to the 5 fold differences in concentration observed for some te across the ar at t2 fig 5 this lack of sensitivity could be due to the resistance of large rivers to some diel changes owing to the larger volume of water and associated mixing of multiple source inputs however further investigation is recommended 5 conclusions and future directions given the observed conservative mixing and transport behavior of fe bearing colloids in the ar downstream concentrations of these colloids and associated tes will increase in step with local exports from wetlands and groundwaters while recent global increases in the browning of boreal rivers has thus likely increased the transport of these colloids to downstream reaches their delivery to the ocean requires transport through other areas with changing conditions that may impact their stability such as lower flows potentially causing sedimentation in deltas hence the size based behavior of fe bearing colloids in the freshwater deltas of large boreal rivers requires additional investigation e g the peace athabasca delta a unesco world heritage site where the ar merges with the peace river and enters lake athabasca delayed and inconsistent source contributions and mixing behaviour in large boreal river systems can produce considerable errors in source attribution during water quality monitoring such errors may result in the inadequate protection of these sensitive and valuable resources or the overregulation of industry hence water quality monitoring in large boreal rivers like the ar requires high resolution spatial sampling if appropriate methods are used to minimize the risk of sample contamination during collection and analysis the measurement of multiple natural geochemical tracers dissolved tes and the distribution of these tes amongst colloidal forms can be applied to effectively assess these mixing processes and source contributions the observed mixing rates and source inputs to the ar and other boreal systems with complex input profiles will differ with season and in response to other changes impacting local hydraulic gradients such as periods of drought floods and climate change given the sensitive nature of boreal systems minor changes in local hydrology may have disproportionately large impacts on the contributions of various sources altering both the salinity of waters and exports of fe and organic matter the resulting changes and instabilities in water quality may threaten the health of downstream ecosystems by altering the habitat or worse producing an unstable habitat heightened or inconsistent exports of fe tes and dom also pose challenges for water treatment as such the responses of large boreal rivers like the ar to these stresses and associated impacts on downstream water quality and ecosystems should be frequently monitored to improve our awareness of potential ecological damage the protection of these ecosystems and associated flow contributions from various sources may be especially important in areas like the lower ar where indigenous communities are directly dependent upon ecosystem services and associated resources the high quality data and improved spatial resolution of the current work have provided a snapshot of the implications of delayed mixing and associated instabilities in large boreal rivers however a complete picture requires additional study with higher spatial resolution conducted under a suite of hydrologic regimes credit authorship contribution statement c w cuss conceptualization data curation fieldwork formal

4661,streamflow forecasting is an important component of water resources planning and management data driven models ddms are common approaches for streamflow prediction ddms try to obtain a mathematical relation between variables without any prior knowledge or assumption about the physical relation between them hence these models are effective for complex process modeling in this study we use the support vector regression svr and multiple linear regression mlr models for long term streamflow prediction moreover three approaches random forest rf deep auto encoder dae and principle component analysis method pca are employed as pre processing methods and they are combined to svr and mlr six hybrid models produced in order to improve the accuracy of prediction and reduce its uncertainty different evaluation criteria including r2 rmse nse p factor and r factor are computed to evaluate the efficiency of the hybrid models the results of our study on bookan dam indicate that the dae svr model in comparison with the pca mlr rf mlr dae mlr pca svr hybrid models provides a significant improvement in the runoff prediction accuracy and the reduction of its uncertainty dae svr and rf svr have the highest values in nse 0 93 and 0 87 respectively and the lowest values in rmse 33 85 and 43 68 mcm respectively for the first forecast horizon the uncertainty analysis of the streamflow prediction shows that dae svr has the best performance at the 95 confidence level due to its p factor and r factor values 0 9 and 0 64 respectively furthermore the dae svr performance is likewise better than other hybrid models in the two three and four months forecast horizons keywords long term streamflow prediction dimension reduction approach variable selection approach random forest deep auto encoder support vector regression 1 introduction prediction and awareness of hydrological cycle parameters such as streamflow and precipitation are essential for a successful water resources management the hydrological cycle is a complex and dynamic process and many variables affect the forecasting of hydrological parameters in order to simulate the hydrological cycle some hydrological models are developed using physics based and numerical approaches or several data driven methods the hydrological models are generally categorized into physical and data driven models ddms the complex relation of the environmental variables and streamflow makes a limitation on employing the physical models for simple hydrological processes khan and coulibaly 2006 ddms need fewer input variables and can be developed from the historical records without considering an explicit physics based scheme mosavi et al 2018 several ddms are already used to predict streamflow they generally build a statistical relationship between the meteorological variables and streamflow robertson et al 2012 wang et al 2017 they use different algorithms such as support vector regression svr gizaw and gan 2016 artificial neural network ann khazaee poul et al 2019 classification and regression tree cart erdal and karakurt 2013 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis ehteram et al 2019 and multiple linear regression model mlr svr mlr and ann have widely been used in other studies for forecasting parameters such as soil moisture ahmad et al 2010 precipitation ortiz garcía et al 2014 and streamflow jajarmizadeh et al 2015 the outcomes of these studies demonstrate the superiority of svr over mlr and ann svr can also be used to predict streamflow on long and short term scales gizaw and gan 2016 huang et al 2014 ddms are highly sensitive to the number of input variables which are selected for developing models they generally have three major sources of uncertainty data uncertainty the poor quality of predictors variable uncertainty inappropriate selection of predictor variables and model uncertainty inability to capture physical processes to decrease aforementioned uncertainties two pre processing approaches are employed for the input variables selection and the dimensionality reduction the first approach improves models performance by choosing a suitable set of predictors bowden et al 2005 different methods have been developed for this purpose such as forward selection fs wang et al 2006 mutual information mi abdourahamane et al 2019 and random forest rf wang et al 2015 rf has widely been applied in hydrology for example measuring the risks of destructive floods wang et al 2015 river streamflow impacts on historical fish life strategies mcmanamay and frimpong 2015 daily streamflow forecasting papacharalampous and tyralis 2018 and predicting particle shape in the extreme streamflow tyralis et al 2019 dimensionality reduction methods are categorized into linear and nonlinear methods these methods simplify ddms by reducing the dimension of the input variables and the number of requested data principle component analysis pca is a popular linear method which has been widely used in hydrology westra et al 2007 wang et al 2020 nonlinear methods include different techniques such as generalized discriminant analysis gda singh and silakari 2009 kernel pca and auto encoder auto encoder has been extensively applied in several fields lv et al 2018 saenz et al 2018 shao et al 2017 in this study six hybrid models that consists of the combinations of mlr and svr as ddms with rf deep auto encoder dae and pca as pre processing approaches are applied to improve the accuracy of monthly inflow predictions of the bookan dam located in north west of iran the organization of the paper is as follows in section 2 the study area historical data and their statistical parameters are presented section 3 introduces the rf and dae pre processing methods the svr model and the evaluation criteria are also provided in this section the outcomes of the pre processing methods and the description of the important variables are presented in section 4 section 5 discusses the hybrid models from one to four forecast horizon followed by the conclusion in section 6 2 case study the bookan dam the proposed approach is employed to predict the bookan dam runoff it is located in the lake urmia basin iran with a catchment area of 7018 km2 the average annual rainfall in the catchment is 78 mm which it results in average annual runoff about 138 4 million cubic meters mcm the basin consists of four sub basins jighatuchai saghezchai saroughchaki and kherkherehchai that all of them have meteorological and hydrometric stations at their entrances and outlets the bookan dam capacity is 800 mcm and it supplies the domestic demand of the bookan miandoab and tabriz cities fig 1 shows the bookan dam location in iran and the meteorological and hydrometric station positions in its catchment there are two meteorological stations in the catchment which one of them saqez has a long term climatological data therefore the average maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation of saqez are used in this study five large scale signals influencing the catchment are selected as streamflow predictors jalili et al 2016 vaheddoost 2017 which due to the importance of el niño southern oscillation enso climatic signal between them three indices of this signal i e southern oscillation index soi oceanic niño index oni and east central tropical pacific sst nino3 4 are employed moreover sea surface temperature sst and sea level pressure slp variables in the range of 20 w to 80 e and 20 s to 50 n with a spatial resolution accuracy of 2 2 and 2 5 2 5 km are chosen as streamflow predictors respectively due to the large coverage network of sst and slp pca is employed to reduce dimensions and their essential components are added to the database for modeling the periods of 1980 to 2010 and 2011 to 2018 are selected for the model training and the evaluation of its performance respectively monthly streamflow variables the saqez weather station data the large scale signals and the dimensionality reduction components of sst and slp with a time delay of 6 6 9 and 6 steps lags respectively are the inputs of the proposed approach table 1 presents the input statistical information fig 2 shows the monthly probability density function pdf of the bookan dam inflow according to it the variance of the dam inflow is high in april may march and february and it follows a normal distribution in the other months therefore these four months are important for evaluating the ddms accuracy and ddms with the ability of accurate streamflow prediction in them have a great value in the inflow prediction 3 material and methods 3 1 random forest pre processing breiman 2001 introduced rf as a computing method to handle the nonlinear and non gaussian data it is free of over fitting problem when the number of trees increases breiman 2001 a special advantage of rf is the selection of important variables over a target variable by the ability of computing the importance of each input variable used in the training process rf applies two important criteria mean decrease impurity mdi and mean decrease accuracy mda in order to rank the important variables mdi is calculated based on the sum of the reduction in the impurity node of the categorization on the averaged variables over all trees mda means that if a variable is not important the reuse of its value should not decrease the accuracy of the prediction it uses out of bag oob error estimation to select the important variables oob computes an important variable which is a prediction error for unselected samples in the random selection process to measure the significance of a variable j first random exchanges of variable x j are performed in different oob states then it is placed in the tree mda for the variable x j is determined by the average of different values of oob before and after the exchange in the all trees more descriptions are presented by louppe 2014 mda is defined as 1 mda x j 1 m l 1 m r n m n θ l d l n j r n m n θ l d l n where r n for d d l n j or d d l n is defined as 2 r n m n θ l d 1 d i x i y i d y i m n x i θ l 2 eq 2 can be simplified as eq 3 3 md a x j e y m n x j θ 2 e y m n x θ 2 where x j x 1 x j x p x j is an independent copy of x j it should be mentioned that the two parameters of the number of trees and selected variables in the random forest algorithm should be optimized before modeling 3 2 auto encoder pre processing method as noted before auto encoder is a nonlinear dimensionality method it trains a network using non supervised learning and provides data sets with fewer dimensions than input data it has a strong relationship with the principal component analysis pca method when uses only one sigmoid hidden layer or linear activation function chicco et al 2014 there are various techniques to enhance the ability of auto encoders such as deep auto encoder dae hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 stack denoising auto encoder vincent et al 2010 variation auto encoder kingma and welling 2014 and stacked convolutional auto encoders masci et al 2011 in this study three layer dae or stacked auto encoder is used dae better identifies the complexities of the input data with multiple hidden layers fig 3 shows the schematic of dae with the number of neurons how it finds the best network of hidden layers and reduces the input data size with the central hidden layer dae can be described in six steps as follows one variables are entered into the network as data sets two data sets are mapped to other sets with fewer dimensions using the activation function three the corresponding sets of input sets are reproduced by mapping set in step 2 four the rebuilding error is calculated for each set with intending to minimize it five the process of backpropagation is performed from the last layer to the first one in order to update the network weights six repeating abovementioned steps until the number of epochs is completed for the case of this study a range of number of neurons is used for each hidden layer to find the best network of neurons at the encoder step which is specified at the top of each layer as a result the best network is obtained with 72 neurons in the first hidden layer 39 neurons in the second hidden layer and 15 neurons in the bottleneck layer 3 3 support vector regression svr svr is in fact a generalized version of the support vector machine svm model that a regression capability adds to it by introducing a ε insensitive error function vapnik et al 1997 to explain the function of the model it is supposed that s x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x l y l is the set of training data in the next n input space where x i r n the model transports the data to an upper space using function φ and then optimizes the new problem using lagrange binary theorem and the appropriate kernel function as shown in eqs 4 and 5 which are the model objective function and its constraints respectively 4 m i n i m i z e 1 2 w 2 c i 0 l ξ ξ 5 s u b j e c t e d t o y i w x i b i ξ w x i b y i i ξ ξ i ξ i 0 i 1 l where ξ and ξ are the auxiliary variables for dealing with the impossible constraints the constant c represents the penalty value and ε is the deviation between the actual target values and the training samples in the nonlinear data the kernel function transports data from high to low dimensions the radial basis function rbf kernel is demonstrated the high performance of predicting nonlinear streamflow data for svr choy and chan 2003 yu et al 2004 therefore the rbf kernel function is used in this study with the equation of k x i x j exp x i x j 2 2 σ 2 3 4 evaluation criteria five statistical quantities including r2 rmse nse r factor and p factor are used to evaluate the performance of streamflow prediction models r2 is the square of the pearson correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted values of monthly streamflow and should be bigger than 0 5 ayele et al 2017 nse is a criterion for a good fitness between observed and predicted values and the performance of the model is acceptable when nse is greater than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 rmse is used to calculate the value of the model errors the optimal value of rmse is zero which belongs to a model with the highest accuracy p and r are used to investigate a model uncertainty at the 95 confidence level r is the average width of the given uncertainty limits divided by the standard deviation of the observations p represents the percentage of observations that are inside the given uncertainty bounds the value of r changes between zero and infinity and it is between zero and one for p when p is close to one it shows the superiority of the model to analyze the uncertainty of these criteria the p r ratio is used in this study table 2 shows the relationship between the criteria and their range of changes in summary the proposed approach has four main stages 1 data collection 2 data pre processing 3 data driven modeling and 4 evaluation and selection of the best model the first step involves the collection of the variables listed in table 1 in this step the pca linear reduction method is used due to lots of sst and slp data the second step is comprised of two subdivisions the variable selection rf and the dimensionality reduction methods dae pca for pre processing in the third step the modeling process is performed using mlr and svr and finally in the last one the best hybrid model is selected from the six hybrid models fig 4 illustrates the aforementioned steps 4 results in this section the results of pre processing methods and the hybrid models are presented 4 1 pre processing methods according to figs 3 and 4 the least squares of the errors are related to a network with the neurons number 99 72 39 15 which 72 and 15 belong to the outermost and the innermost layers of the hidden layers respectively 99 represents the number of the input variables to the network and 39 is the number of neurons in the second hidden layer in dae the adam optimizer and the mean squared error functions are used to update the network weights by training data kingma and ba 2014 the hyperbolic tangent is the activation function in the hidden layer neurons of the network the values of the epoch batch size and network learning rates are set to 2000 50 and 0 01 respectively it should be noted that the data input of the network requires to be normalized in order to have a high performance network the cumulative variance of the pcas with a threshold of 80 is used to select the number of suitable pcas which eventually led to the first 10 pcas to enter the modeling process in rf the best number of variables is obtained by the algorithm showed by the red dashed on the left side of fig 4 the first 18 variables have the lowest rmse among the other variables two mtry and ntree parameters are also determined in the rf algorithm with the grid search method and their values are calculated as 24 and 500 respectively in fig 5 the number of 40 predictor variables among the 99 potential predictor variables is presented to predict the inflow to the bookan dam in the one month forecast horizon based on the rf variable selection method according to the predictor variables shown in fig 5 the streamflow with one step delay and the value of 14 6 for mda in rf is the best predictor variable afterwards the variables of the first fundamental component of sea level temperature with one delay step sst pc1 l1 the maximum temperature of the saqez station at the one delay step tmax t 1 the maximum temperature of the saqez station at the second delay step tmax t 1 and the precipitation of the saqez station at the one delay step pt1 with values of 11 4 9 9 and 8 6 respectively are selected for the mda criterion in the second to fifth ranks 18 predictor variables which provide the best mda criterion in the rf algorithm are chosen among all predictor variables to be used in the modeling 4 2 hybrid models six different hybrid models are made by the combination of mlr and svr with rf pca and dae to evaluate the long term streamflow prediction and its uncertainty table 3 presents the models and their abbreviations 5 discussion the results of the six hybrid models are compared to each other utilizing the different evaluation criteria introduced in section 3 4 in order to determine their performance they examine individually and their results for the streamflow forecast horizons from one to four months are used thus this section is divided into three subsections the first and second subsections interpret the performance of the models for the one month forecast horizon and the third one discusses their outcomes for the other forecast horizons 5 1 accuracy evaluation of the hybrid models the proposed hybrid models are applied to predict the inflow of the bookan dam the modeling process is conducted in two training and testing periods using preprocessing methods and the hybrid models the models performance is also investigated based on the criteria presented in section 3 4 the test results are shown in table 4 and fig 6 presents the dam long term streamflow prediction in one month forecast horizon by the hybrid models the monthly flow prediction modeling is performed using svr without pre processing the values of r2 for the training and testing periods for the one month forecast horizon are 0 95 and 0 50 respectively which indicates the over fitting according to table 4 dae svr and pca mlr have the highest and lowest r2 coefficients for the one month forecast horizon respectively considering rmse the lowest value is for dae svr with 33 85 mcm whereas pca mlr has the highest rmse value 92 41 mcm dae svr and pca mlr have the highest and the lowest nse 0 92 and 0 40 respectively based on the criteria presented in table 4 dae svr and rf svr present the best performances in predicting the inflow of the one month forecast horizon respectively the combination of the two proposed pre processors with mlr improves the modeling performance where the combined models of rf mlr and dae mlr show 16 and 18 percent decrement in rmse 4 and 9 percent increment in r2 and 42 and 48 percent increment in nse compared to pca mlr respectively although the criterion for evaluating the pre processing methods combined with mlr is in an acceptable range a nonlinear model is also required due to the high nonlinear behavior of the hydrological variables the pre processing methods combined with svr show a substantial improvement in the prediction accuracy compared to mlr where the rmse of pca svr rf svr and dae svr are improved 40 44 and 56 percent compared to the pca mlr rf mlr and dae mlr respectively in addition the nse values are improved by 92 52 and 54 percent respectively the values of the r2 nse and rmse criteria for dae svr are 0 93 0 92 and 33 85 mcm respectively the relationship between the predictor variables and target variables in complex hydrological phenomena is complex and nonlinear baker and brunsdon 2003 therefore the combination of the pre processors with a nonlinear model improves the accuracy of monthly streamflow prediction compared to a linear model as a result the proposed dae svr hybrid model the combination of the dae nonlinear preprocessing and the nonlinear svr model presents better results compared to other hybrid models the left photos of fig 7 show the distribution of the predicted values by the six hybrid models versus the real values in the test period for years 2011 2018 in four forecast horizons 1 1 line is plotted for scatter plots and nse are reported for all hybrid models in each forecast horizon the right side of fig 7 illustrates the pdf of the models for the test period in the four forecast horizons as shown in fig 7 the solid line between the observed and predicted values by the hybrid dae svr model yellow line in the upper left demonstrates the closest distance to the 1 1 line in addition the nse of dae svr 0 90 is higher than the other hybrid models the peak and minimum predicted streamflow by rf and dae for the one month forecast horizon are in good agreement with the observed values which it emphasizes the ability of limit event prediction e g floods moreover the closest pdf of the hybrid models to the pdf of the observed data for the one month forecast horizon first right row belongs to the proposed dae svr hybrid model therefore dae svr and rf svr have the best performances for predicting the inflow of the bookan dam respectively fig 2 shows the distribution of the bookan dam monthly inflow in feb mar apr and may which they do not follow the normal probabilistic distribution in addition the highest volumes of the bookan dam inflow belong to these months therefore a model that is capable of dealing with these months has great importance in the modeling fig 8 shows r2 and rmse of the predicted values for the monthly inflow of the bookan dam in different months as shown in this figure the dae svr hybrid model has the best performance in comparison with the other hybrid models for the months that the distribution of the streamflow is not normal it has the highest values of r2 in february march april and may 0 72 0 85 0 87 and 0 96 respectively similarly the rmse of dae svr for these months are 45 5 116 1 126 5 and 44 8 mcm respectively which are the lowest values for the one month forecast horizon compared to the other hybrid models these results indicate that the dae svr and rf svr hybrid models have significant abilities to predict monthly streamflow in high volume streamflow and irregular regimes all proposed hybrid models show little abilities to predict low streamflow this situation may be related to the climatic conditions of the study area since precipitation is one of the most important elements affecting the runoff its predictability plays an essential role in the modeling of the streamflow the study area is located in the mediterranean climate thus the precipitation of this area is affected by the mediterranean air mass fallah et al 2017 it has the characteristics of wet winters and hot and dry summers lionello et al 2006 and the continuous and light rainfall from several hours to several days from late november to mid april another air mass that affects the study area is the european arctic air mass much smaller than the mediterranean air mass which causes a significant decrease in temperature in the region the main characteristic of this air mass is rapid spring showers and snowfall during the cold season hence the flow modeling of the study area in march april and may shows better performance compared to other months it should be noted that in the rainy months the combined models have better performance compared to the rainless months on the other hand sung et al 2020 indicated that streamflow modeling using models which are related to precipitation and temperature have low predictability in dry condition similarly yaghoubi et al 2019 showed that data driven models have better performance in predicting monthly streamflow in the wet condition compared to the dry condition these studies confirm the low values of the criteria presented in the present study for rainless months versus rainy months 5 2 evaluation of the uncertainty of the hybrid models the bootstrapping approach efron and tibshirani 1994 is used to determine the confidence interval at the 95 level for the inflow of the bookan dam during the test period 1000 bootstrap datasets are generated for each hybrid model for example fig 9 shows the confidence interval corresponding to the 95 confidence level for the top three hybrid models in the test period for the one month forecast horizon the ratio of p and r p r is used to examine the uncertainty of the models and compare between the results of the models table 4 column p r shows the results of applying the approach for the case of this study according to table 4 the p and r values for dae svr are 0 9 and 0 67 respectively for the one month forecast horizon which are better than other hybrid models the second best hybrid model is rf svr with the values of 0 64 and 0 55 respectively it should be noted that pca svr has a higher p compared to rf svr but it is located in the third place due to the high value of its r in comparison with rf svr and the balance between these criteria the mlr hybrid models have lower p and r in compared with the svr hybrid models but the consideration of the balance between these two criteria shows the superiority of the svr models over the mlr models in dealing with uncertainty therefore the dae svr hybrid model with a p r ratio of 1 31 has the best performance in estimating uncertainty compared to other hybrid models the p r ratio of the pca mlr hybrid model is 0 77 for the one month forecast horizon 5 3 the accuracy of hybrid models for other forecast horizons this subsection discusses the results of the hybrid models for the two three and four month forecast horizons fig 10 shows the comparison of the various criteria obtained from the six hybrid models for the four forecast horizons as shown in this figure dae svr has the best performance not only in the one month forecast horizon but also in the other forecast horizons as expected the accuracy of the streamflow forecasting declines with the increase of the forecast horizons moreover when the forecast horizon increases r2 and nse decrease and rmse increases although the dae svr and the rf svr hybrid models have high accuracy in the first to fourth prediction horizons they also have the highest slope of change in comparison with the other hybrid models the nash coefficient of dae svr and rf svr in the fourth prediction horizon compared to the first forecast horizon decrease by 0 24 and 0 3 respectively while this reduction is 0 2 0 13 0 17 and 0 1 for pca mlr rf mlr pca svr respectively as presented in fig 7 and table 4 when the forecast horizon is more than one month the proposed pre processing methods by combining with the ddms are able to improve their performances in long term streamflow forecasting the nse values of the dae svr hybrid model for the two three and four month forecast horizons are obtained as 0 80 0 76 and 0 68 respectively also the second best hybrid model i e rf svr shows the best performance with the nse benchmarks of 0 7 and 0 65 respectively for the two and three month forecast horizons but its nse is 0 57 in the four month forecast horizon which is less than one of the pca svr models i e nse 0 68 on the other hand the dae svr hybrid model has the closest pdf to the observed ones for the three forecast horizons as previously mentioned february march april and may have more important than other months due to the high scattering of the streamflow data in them and the high volume of the bookan dam inflow hence the dae svr hybrid model has the better performance in one month forecast horizon and other foregoing horizons the values of the p r ratio for the four forecast horizons are given in the last row of fig 10 the highest values of this ratio for the four prediction horizons belong to the dae svr hybrid model with values of 1 31 1 2 1 23 and 1 15 respectively 6 conclusion in this study the combinations of the svr and mlr models with the rf dae and pca methods are introduced to improve the accuracy of the bookan dam monthly streamflow prediction and to reduce its uncertainty in the pre processing section the dae dimensionality reduction method reduces the number of predictor variables from 99 to 15 by forming a grid 99 72 39 15 in its encoder section the pca method selects the first 10 pcas to enter the modeling process in addition the rf input variable selection method performs among all input variables and it selects the first 18 important variables for forecasting the first horizon the outcomes show that the hybrid models derived from the two methods of dae and rf improve the accuracy and decrease the uncertainty of the models for forecasting the first horizon the dae svr hybrid model for forecasting first horizon presents the r2 nse and rmse values of 0 93 0 92 and 33 85 mcm respectively similarly dae svr has the best performance of the uncertainty analysis by presenting the values of 0 90 and 0 69 for the p and r factor criteria in addition it achieves the best performance for the flow predicting in two three and four month forecast horizons based on the above mentioned evaluation criteria the second best hybrid model is rf svr also dae svr and rf svr have the better performance of the four forecast horizons regarding our work results to increases the accuracy and speed of the modeling of similar studies it can be suggested that all effective and possible variables are firstly collected and then appropriate ones are chosen using the dimensionality reduction and variable selection

4661,streamflow forecasting is an important component of water resources planning and management data driven models ddms are common approaches for streamflow prediction ddms try to obtain a mathematical relation between variables without any prior knowledge or assumption about the physical relation between them hence these models are effective for complex process modeling in this study we use the support vector regression svr and multiple linear regression mlr models for long term streamflow prediction moreover three approaches random forest rf deep auto encoder dae and principle component analysis method pca are employed as pre processing methods and they are combined to svr and mlr six hybrid models produced in order to improve the accuracy of prediction and reduce its uncertainty different evaluation criteria including r2 rmse nse p factor and r factor are computed to evaluate the efficiency of the hybrid models the results of our study on bookan dam indicate that the dae svr model in comparison with the pca mlr rf mlr dae mlr pca svr hybrid models provides a significant improvement in the runoff prediction accuracy and the reduction of its uncertainty dae svr and rf svr have the highest values in nse 0 93 and 0 87 respectively and the lowest values in rmse 33 85 and 43 68 mcm respectively for the first forecast horizon the uncertainty analysis of the streamflow prediction shows that dae svr has the best performance at the 95 confidence level due to its p factor and r factor values 0 9 and 0 64 respectively furthermore the dae svr performance is likewise better than other hybrid models in the two three and four months forecast horizons keywords long term streamflow prediction dimension reduction approach variable selection approach random forest deep auto encoder support vector regression 1 introduction prediction and awareness of hydrological cycle parameters such as streamflow and precipitation are essential for a successful water resources management the hydrological cycle is a complex and dynamic process and many variables affect the forecasting of hydrological parameters in order to simulate the hydrological cycle some hydrological models are developed using physics based and numerical approaches or several data driven methods the hydrological models are generally categorized into physical and data driven models ddms the complex relation of the environmental variables and streamflow makes a limitation on employing the physical models for simple hydrological processes khan and coulibaly 2006 ddms need fewer input variables and can be developed from the historical records without considering an explicit physics based scheme mosavi et al 2018 several ddms are already used to predict streamflow they generally build a statistical relationship between the meteorological variables and streamflow robertson et al 2012 wang et al 2017 they use different algorithms such as support vector regression svr gizaw and gan 2016 artificial neural network ann khazaee poul et al 2019 classification and regression tree cart erdal and karakurt 2013 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis ehteram et al 2019 and multiple linear regression model mlr svr mlr and ann have widely been used in other studies for forecasting parameters such as soil moisture ahmad et al 2010 precipitation ortiz garcía et al 2014 and streamflow jajarmizadeh et al 2015 the outcomes of these studies demonstrate the superiority of svr over mlr and ann svr can also be used to predict streamflow on long and short term scales gizaw and gan 2016 huang et al 2014 ddms are highly sensitive to the number of input variables which are selected for developing models they generally have three major sources of uncertainty data uncertainty the poor quality of predictors variable uncertainty inappropriate selection of predictor variables and model uncertainty inability to capture physical processes to decrease aforementioned uncertainties two pre processing approaches are employed for the input variables selection and the dimensionality reduction the first approach improves models performance by choosing a suitable set of predictors bowden et al 2005 different methods have been developed for this purpose such as forward selection fs wang et al 2006 mutual information mi abdourahamane et al 2019 and random forest rf wang et al 2015 rf has widely been applied in hydrology for example measuring the risks of destructive floods wang et al 2015 river streamflow impacts on historical fish life strategies mcmanamay and frimpong 2015 daily streamflow forecasting papacharalampous and tyralis 2018 and predicting particle shape in the extreme streamflow tyralis et al 2019 dimensionality reduction methods are categorized into linear and nonlinear methods these methods simplify ddms by reducing the dimension of the input variables and the number of requested data principle component analysis pca is a popular linear method which has been widely used in hydrology westra et al 2007 wang et al 2020 nonlinear methods include different techniques such as generalized discriminant analysis gda singh and silakari 2009 kernel pca and auto encoder auto encoder has been extensively applied in several fields lv et al 2018 saenz et al 2018 shao et al 2017 in this study six hybrid models that consists of the combinations of mlr and svr as ddms with rf deep auto encoder dae and pca as pre processing approaches are applied to improve the accuracy of monthly inflow predictions of the bookan dam located in north west of iran the organization of the paper is as follows in section 2 the study area historical data and their statistical parameters are presented section 3 introduces the rf and dae pre processing methods the svr model and the evaluation criteria are also provided in this section the outcomes of the pre processing methods and the description of the important variables are presented in section 4 section 5 discusses the hybrid models from one to four forecast horizon followed by the conclusion in section 6 2 case study the bookan dam the proposed approach is employed to predict the bookan dam runoff it is located in the lake urmia basin iran with a catchment area of 7018 km2 the average annual rainfall in the catchment is 78 mm which it results in average annual runoff about 138 4 million cubic meters mcm the basin consists of four sub basins jighatuchai saghezchai saroughchaki and kherkherehchai that all of them have meteorological and hydrometric stations at their entrances and outlets the bookan dam capacity is 800 mcm and it supplies the domestic demand of the bookan miandoab and tabriz cities fig 1 shows the bookan dam location in iran and the meteorological and hydrometric station positions in its catchment there are two meteorological stations in the catchment which one of them saqez has a long term climatological data therefore the average maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation of saqez are used in this study five large scale signals influencing the catchment are selected as streamflow predictors jalili et al 2016 vaheddoost 2017 which due to the importance of el niño southern oscillation enso climatic signal between them three indices of this signal i e southern oscillation index soi oceanic niño index oni and east central tropical pacific sst nino3 4 are employed moreover sea surface temperature sst and sea level pressure slp variables in the range of 20 w to 80 e and 20 s to 50 n with a spatial resolution accuracy of 2 2 and 2 5 2 5 km are chosen as streamflow predictors respectively due to the large coverage network of sst and slp pca is employed to reduce dimensions and their essential components are added to the database for modeling the periods of 1980 to 2010 and 2011 to 2018 are selected for the model training and the evaluation of its performance respectively monthly streamflow variables the saqez weather station data the large scale signals and the dimensionality reduction components of sst and slp with a time delay of 6 6 9 and 6 steps lags respectively are the inputs of the proposed approach table 1 presents the input statistical information fig 2 shows the monthly probability density function pdf of the bookan dam inflow according to it the variance of the dam inflow is high in april may march and february and it follows a normal distribution in the other months therefore these four months are important for evaluating the ddms accuracy and ddms with the ability of accurate streamflow prediction in them have a great value in the inflow prediction 3 material and methods 3 1 random forest pre processing breiman 2001 introduced rf as a computing method to handle the nonlinear and non gaussian data it is free of over fitting problem when the number of trees increases breiman 2001 a special advantage of rf is the selection of important variables over a target variable by the ability of computing the importance of each input variable used in the training process rf applies two important criteria mean decrease impurity mdi and mean decrease accuracy mda in order to rank the important variables mdi is calculated based on the sum of the reduction in the impurity node of the categorization on the averaged variables over all trees mda means that if a variable is not important the reuse of its value should not decrease the accuracy of the prediction it uses out of bag oob error estimation to select the important variables oob computes an important variable which is a prediction error for unselected samples in the random selection process to measure the significance of a variable j first random exchanges of variable x j are performed in different oob states then it is placed in the tree mda for the variable x j is determined by the average of different values of oob before and after the exchange in the all trees more descriptions are presented by louppe 2014 mda is defined as 1 mda x j 1 m l 1 m r n m n θ l d l n j r n m n θ l d l n where r n for d d l n j or d d l n is defined as 2 r n m n θ l d 1 d i x i y i d y i m n x i θ l 2 eq 2 can be simplified as eq 3 3 md a x j e y m n x j θ 2 e y m n x θ 2 where x j x 1 x j x p x j is an independent copy of x j it should be mentioned that the two parameters of the number of trees and selected variables in the random forest algorithm should be optimized before modeling 3 2 auto encoder pre processing method as noted before auto encoder is a nonlinear dimensionality method it trains a network using non supervised learning and provides data sets with fewer dimensions than input data it has a strong relationship with the principal component analysis pca method when uses only one sigmoid hidden layer or linear activation function chicco et al 2014 there are various techniques to enhance the ability of auto encoders such as deep auto encoder dae hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 stack denoising auto encoder vincent et al 2010 variation auto encoder kingma and welling 2014 and stacked convolutional auto encoders masci et al 2011 in this study three layer dae or stacked auto encoder is used dae better identifies the complexities of the input data with multiple hidden layers fig 3 shows the schematic of dae with the number of neurons how it finds the best network of hidden layers and reduces the input data size with the central hidden layer dae can be described in six steps as follows one variables are entered into the network as data sets two data sets are mapped to other sets with fewer dimensions using the activation function three the corresponding sets of input sets are reproduced by mapping set in step 2 four the rebuilding error is calculated for each set with intending to minimize it five the process of backpropagation is performed from the last layer to the first one in order to update the network weights six repeating abovementioned steps until the number of epochs is completed for the case of this study a range of number of neurons is used for each hidden layer to find the best network of neurons at the encoder step which is specified at the top of each layer as a result the best network is obtained with 72 neurons in the first hidden layer 39 neurons in the second hidden layer and 15 neurons in the bottleneck layer 3 3 support vector regression svr svr is in fact a generalized version of the support vector machine svm model that a regression capability adds to it by introducing a ε insensitive error function vapnik et al 1997 to explain the function of the model it is supposed that s x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x l y l is the set of training data in the next n input space where x i r n the model transports the data to an upper space using function φ and then optimizes the new problem using lagrange binary theorem and the appropriate kernel function as shown in eqs 4 and 5 which are the model objective function and its constraints respectively 4 m i n i m i z e 1 2 w 2 c i 0 l ξ ξ 5 s u b j e c t e d t o y i w x i b i ξ w x i b y i i ξ ξ i ξ i 0 i 1 l where ξ and ξ are the auxiliary variables for dealing with the impossible constraints the constant c represents the penalty value and ε is the deviation between the actual target values and the training samples in the nonlinear data the kernel function transports data from high to low dimensions the radial basis function rbf kernel is demonstrated the high performance of predicting nonlinear streamflow data for svr choy and chan 2003 yu et al 2004 therefore the rbf kernel function is used in this study with the equation of k x i x j exp x i x j 2 2 σ 2 3 4 evaluation criteria five statistical quantities including r2 rmse nse r factor and p factor are used to evaluate the performance of streamflow prediction models r2 is the square of the pearson correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted values of monthly streamflow and should be bigger than 0 5 ayele et al 2017 nse is a criterion for a good fitness between observed and predicted values and the performance of the model is acceptable when nse is greater than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 rmse is used to calculate the value of the model errors the optimal value of rmse is zero which belongs to a model with the highest accuracy p and r are used to investigate a model uncertainty at the 95 confidence level r is the average width of the given uncertainty limits divided by the standard deviation of the observations p represents the percentage of observations that are inside the given uncertainty bounds the value of r changes between zero and infinity and it is between zero and one for p when p is close to one it shows the superiority of the model to analyze the uncertainty of these criteria the p r ratio is used in this study table 2 shows the relationship between the criteria and their range of changes in summary the proposed approach has four main stages 1 data collection 2 data pre processing 3 data driven modeling and 4 evaluation and selection of the best model the first step involves the collection of the variables listed in table 1 in this step the pca linear reduction method is used due to lots of sst and slp data the second step is comprised of two subdivisions the variable selection rf and the dimensionality reduction methods dae pca for pre processing in the third step the modeling process is performed using mlr and svr and finally in the last one the best hybrid model is selected from the six hybrid models fig 4 illustrates the aforementioned steps 4 results in this section the results of pre processing methods and the hybrid models are presented 4 1 pre processing methods according to figs 3 and 4 the least squares of the errors are related to a network with the neurons number 99 72 39 15 which 72 and 15 belong to the outermost and the innermost layers of the hidden layers respectively 99 represents the number of the input variables to the network and 39 is the number of neurons in the second hidden layer in dae the adam optimizer and the mean squared error functions are used to update the network weights by training data kingma and ba 2014 the hyperbolic tangent is the activation function in the hidden layer neurons of the network the values of the epoch batch size and network learning rates are set to 2000 50 and 0 01 respectively it should be noted that the data input of the network requires to be normalized in order to have a high performance network the cumulative variance of the pcas with a threshold of 80 is used to select the number of suitable pcas which eventually led to the first 10 pcas to enter the modeling process in rf the best number of variables is obtained by the algorithm showed by the red dashed on the left side of fig 4 the first 18 variables have the lowest rmse among the other variables two mtry and ntree parameters are also determined in the rf algorithm with the grid search method and their values are calculated as 24 and 500 respectively in fig 5 the number of 40 predictor variables among the 99 potential predictor variables is presented to predict the inflow to the bookan dam in the one month forecast horizon based on the rf variable selection method according to the predictor variables shown in fig 5 the streamflow with one step delay and the value of 14 6 for mda in rf is the best predictor variable afterwards the variables of the first fundamental component of sea level temperature with one delay step sst pc1 l1 the maximum temperature of the saqez station at the one delay step tmax t 1 the maximum temperature of the saqez station at the second delay step tmax t 1 and the precipitation of the saqez station at the one delay step pt1 with values of 11 4 9 9 and 8 6 respectively are selected for the mda criterion in the second to fifth ranks 18 predictor variables which provide the best mda criterion in the rf algorithm are chosen among all predictor variables to be used in the modeling 4 2 hybrid models six different hybrid models are made by the combination of mlr and svr with rf pca and dae to evaluate the long term streamflow prediction and its uncertainty table 3 presents the models and their abbreviations 5 discussion the results of the six hybrid models are compared to each other utilizing the different evaluation criteria introduced in section 3 4 in order to determine their performance they examine individually and their results for the streamflow forecast horizons from one to four months are used thus this section is divided into three subsections the first and second subsections interpret the performance of the models for the one month forecast horizon and the third one discusses their outcomes for the other forecast horizons 5 1 accuracy evaluation of the hybrid models the proposed hybrid models are applied to predict the inflow of the bookan dam the modeling process is conducted in two training and testing periods using preprocessing methods and the hybrid models the models performance is also investigated based on the criteria presented in section 3 4 the test results are shown in table 4 and fig 6 presents the dam long term streamflow prediction in one month forecast horizon by the hybrid models the monthly flow prediction modeling is performed using svr without pre processing the values of r2 for the training and testing periods for the one month forecast horizon are 0 95 and 0 50 respectively which indicates the over fitting according to table 4 dae svr and pca mlr have the highest and lowest r2 coefficients for the one month forecast horizon respectively considering rmse the lowest value is for dae svr with 33 85 mcm whereas pca mlr has the highest rmse value 92 41 mcm dae svr and pca mlr have the highest and the lowest nse 0 92 and 0 40 respectively based on the criteria presented in table 4 dae svr and rf svr present the best performances in predicting the inflow of the one month forecast horizon respectively the combination of the two proposed pre processors with mlr improves the modeling performance where the combined models of rf mlr and dae mlr show 16 and 18 percent decrement in rmse 4 and 9 percent increment in r2 and 42 and 48 percent increment in nse compared to pca mlr respectively although the criterion for evaluating the pre processing methods combined with mlr is in an acceptable range a nonlinear model is also required due to the high nonlinear behavior of the hydrological variables the pre processing methods combined with svr show a substantial improvement in the prediction accuracy compared to mlr where the rmse of pca svr rf svr and dae svr are improved 40 44 and 56 percent compared to the pca mlr rf mlr and dae mlr respectively in addition the nse values are improved by 92 52 and 54 percent respectively the values of the r2 nse and rmse criteria for dae svr are 0 93 0 92 and 33 85 mcm respectively the relationship between the predictor variables and target variables in complex hydrological phenomena is complex and nonlinear baker and brunsdon 2003 therefore the combination of the pre processors with a nonlinear model improves the accuracy of monthly streamflow prediction compared to a linear model as a result the proposed dae svr hybrid model the combination of the dae nonlinear preprocessing and the nonlinear svr model presents better results compared to other hybrid models the left photos of fig 7 show the distribution of the predicted values by the six hybrid models versus the real values in the test period for years 2011 2018 in four forecast horizons 1 1 line is plotted for scatter plots and nse are reported for all hybrid models in each forecast horizon the right side of fig 7 illustrates the pdf of the models for the test period in the four forecast horizons as shown in fig 7 the solid line between the observed and predicted values by the hybrid dae svr model yellow line in the upper left demonstrates the closest distance to the 1 1 line in addition the nse of dae svr 0 90 is higher than the other hybrid models the peak and minimum predicted streamflow by rf and dae for the one month forecast horizon are in good agreement with the observed values which it emphasizes the ability of limit event prediction e g floods moreover the closest pdf of the hybrid models to the pdf of the observed data for the one month forecast horizon first right row belongs to the proposed dae svr hybrid model therefore dae svr and rf svr have the best performances for predicting the inflow of the bookan dam respectively fig 2 shows the distribution of the bookan dam monthly inflow in feb mar apr and may which they do not follow the normal probabilistic distribution in addition the highest volumes of the bookan dam inflow belong to these months therefore a model that is capable of dealing with these months has great importance in the modeling fig 8 shows r2 and rmse of the predicted values for the monthly inflow of the bookan dam in different months as shown in this figure the dae svr hybrid model has the best performance in comparison with the other hybrid models for the months that the distribution of the streamflow is not normal it has the highest values of r2 in february march april and may 0 72 0 85 0 87 and 0 96 respectively similarly the rmse of dae svr for these months are 45 5 116 1 126 5 and 44 8 mcm respectively which are the lowest values for the one month forecast horizon compared to the other hybrid models these results indicate that the dae svr and rf svr hybrid models have significant abilities to predict monthly streamflow in high volume streamflow and irregular regimes all proposed hybrid models show little abilities to predict low streamflow this situation may be related to the climatic conditions of the study area since precipitation is one of the most important elements affecting the runoff its predictability plays an essential role in the modeling of the streamflow the study area is located in the mediterranean climate thus the precipitation of this area is affected by the mediterranean air mass fallah et al 2017 it has the characteristics of wet winters and hot and dry summers lionello et al 2006 and the continuous and light rainfall from several hours to several days from late november to mid april another air mass that affects the study area is the european arctic air mass much smaller than the mediterranean air mass which causes a significant decrease in temperature in the region the main characteristic of this air mass is rapid spring showers and snowfall during the cold season hence the flow modeling of the study area in march april and may shows better performance compared to other months it should be noted that in the rainy months the combined models have better performance compared to the rainless months on the other hand sung et al 2020 indicated that streamflow modeling using models which are related to precipitation and temperature have low predictability in dry condition similarly yaghoubi et al 2019 showed that data driven models have better performance in predicting monthly streamflow in the wet condition compared to the dry condition these studies confirm the low values of the criteria presented in the present study for rainless months versus rainy months 5 2 evaluation of the uncertainty of the hybrid models the bootstrapping approach efron and tibshirani 1994 is used to determine the confidence interval at the 95 level for the inflow of the bookan dam during the test period 1000 bootstrap datasets are generated for each hybrid model for example fig 9 shows the confidence interval corresponding to the 95 confidence level for the top three hybrid models in the test period for the one month forecast horizon the ratio of p and r p r is used to examine the uncertainty of the models and compare between the results of the models table 4 column p r shows the results of applying the approach for the case of this study according to table 4 the p and r values for dae svr are 0 9 and 0 67 respectively for the one month forecast horizon which are better than other hybrid models the second best hybrid model is rf svr with the values of 0 64 and 0 55 respectively it should be noted that pca svr has a higher p compared to rf svr but it is located in the third place due to the high value of its r in comparison with rf svr and the balance between these criteria the mlr hybrid models have lower p and r in compared with the svr hybrid models but the consideration of the balance between these two criteria shows the superiority of the svr models over the mlr models in dealing with uncertainty therefore the dae svr hybrid model with a p r ratio of 1 31 has the best performance in estimating uncertainty compared to other hybrid models the p r ratio of the pca mlr hybrid model is 0 77 for the one month forecast horizon 5 3 the accuracy of hybrid models for other forecast horizons this subsection discusses the results of the hybrid models for the two three and four month forecast horizons fig 10 shows the comparison of the various criteria obtained from the six hybrid models for the four forecast horizons as shown in this figure dae svr has the best performance not only in the one month forecast horizon but also in the other forecast horizons as expected the accuracy of the streamflow forecasting declines with the increase of the forecast horizons moreover when the forecast horizon increases r2 and nse decrease and rmse increases although the dae svr and the rf svr hybrid models have high accuracy in the first to fourth prediction horizons they also have the highest slope of change in comparison with the other hybrid models the nash coefficient of dae svr and rf svr in the fourth prediction horizon compared to the first forecast horizon decrease by 0 24 and 0 3 respectively while this reduction is 0 2 0 13 0 17 and 0 1 for pca mlr rf mlr pca svr respectively as presented in fig 7 and table 4 when the forecast horizon is more than one month the proposed pre processing methods by combining with the ddms are able to improve their performances in long term streamflow forecasting the nse values of the dae svr hybrid model for the two three and four month forecast horizons are obtained as 0 80 0 76 and 0 68 respectively also the second best hybrid model i e rf svr shows the best performance with the nse benchmarks of 0 7 and 0 65 respectively for the two and three month forecast horizons but its nse is 0 57 in the four month forecast horizon which is less than one of the pca svr models i e nse 0 68 on the other hand the dae svr hybrid model has the closest pdf to the observed ones for the three forecast horizons as previously mentioned february march april and may have more important than other months due to the high scattering of the streamflow data in them and the high volume of the bookan dam inflow hence the dae svr hybrid model has the better performance in one month forecast horizon and other foregoing horizons the values of the p r ratio for the four forecast horizons are given in the last row of fig 10 the highest values of this ratio for the four prediction horizons belong to the dae svr hybrid model with values of 1 31 1 2 1 23 and 1 15 respectively 6 conclusion in this study the combinations of the svr and mlr models with the rf dae and pca methods are introduced to improve the accuracy of the bookan dam monthly streamflow prediction and to reduce its uncertainty in the pre processing section the dae dimensionality reduction method reduces the number of predictor variables from 99 to 15 by forming a grid 99 72 39 15 in its encoder section the pca method selects the first 10 pcas to enter the modeling process in addition the rf input variable selection method performs among all input variables and it selects the first 18 important variables for forecasting the first horizon the outcomes show that the hybrid models derived from the two methods of dae and rf improve the accuracy and decrease the uncertainty of the models for forecasting the first horizon the dae svr hybrid model for forecasting first horizon presents the r2 nse and rmse values of 0 93 0 92 and 33 85 mcm respectively similarly dae svr has the best performance of the uncertainty analysis by presenting the values of 0 90 and 0 69 for the p and r factor criteria in addition it achieves the best performance for the flow predicting in two three and four month forecast horizons based on the above mentioned evaluation criteria the second best hybrid model is rf svr also dae svr and rf svr have the better performance of the four forecast horizons regarding our work results to increases the accuracy and speed of the modeling of

continentale et côtière mont saint aignan france corresponding author this manuscript was handled by corrado corradini editor in chief with the assistance of vahid nourani associate editor monitoring groundwater level gwl over long time periods is critical in understanding the variability of groundwater resources in the present context of global changes however in normandy france for example gwls have only been systematically monitored for 20 to 50 years this study evaluates long short term memory lstm neural network modeling to reconstruct gwls fill gaps and extend existing time series the approach is illustrated by using available monitoring fluctuations in piezometers implanted in the chalk aquifer in the normandy region northern france here gwl data recorded over 50 years at 31 piezometers in northwestern normandy is employed to perform gwl prediction to optimize the network performance the most influential factors that impact the accuracy of prediction are first determined such as the network architecture data quantity and quality the resulting network is adopted to reconstruct measurements in the piezometers step by step with an increment of missing observation time the approach requires no calibration for the time lag in data processing and the implementation relies only on the groundwater level fluctuations to retrieve missing data in the targeted piezometers keywords long short term memory groundwater level hydrogeology neural network karstic aquifer normandy 1 introduction monitoring of groundwater level fluctuations over time is considered the main source of information for hydrologists to improve understanding of the evolution of aquifers and water resources across time under global change and eventually to establish water resource management strategies indeed the analysis of the groundwater level collected in a set of piezometers allows to understand the hydrodynamic behavior of the aquifer with respect to the hydrological cycle to longer term climate variability anthropogenic impacts water abstractions and to apprehend the recharge process bekesi et al 2009 valdes et al 2014 interpretation of water level variations also offers the possibility of identifying preferential flow paths with high transmissivities and detecting zones which constitute the best suited areas to be exploited and thus protecting them against any form of contamination almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 therefore management plans adopted are strongly conditioned by the number of piezometers used in monitoring and their capacity both to cover the spatial heterogeneity of the aquifer and to capture the impact of climate mutations on water storage in the long and short terms in general these management plans are drawn up on incomplete and fragmented hydraulic databases that provide only a partial understanding of the hydrosystem due to the very high cost of installing piezometers and maintaining the acquisition of hydraulic parameters over time facing the threats of climate change and the urge for establishing long term strategies for the management and preservation of the environment public authorities and the scientific community have been engaged in recent years in the construction of environmental databases anderson et al 2008 guo and lin 2016 this has led to the emergence of observatories on water resources in the world where a large number of multi parameter sensors are installed in the different compartments of the critical zone to monitor hydro physical geochemical microbiological parameters in order to study the impact of climate change hipsey et al 2015 characklis et al 2007 zacharias et al 2011 jourde et al 2011 gaillardet et al 2018 however investigating the impact of environmental and climate changes on hydrology requires long term multidecadal time series be available this has led to a number of initiatives devoted to reconstructing long term hydrological or hydrometeorological time series that are often based on the derivation of hydrological variations from long term large scale climate reanalyzes e g caillouet et al 2019 bonnet et al 2020 devers et al 2020 this is also encouraged by the emergence of data science such research fields are driven by the progress in computer technologies which have created a favorable environment for the development of machine learning techniques rajaee et al 2019 these approaches have resurfaced in recent years thanks to their ability to generate predictive models by analyzing massive data in less time machine learning applications in the geosciences are gaining popularity particularly in the prediction of groundwater fluctuations including extreme events mosavi et al 2018 indeed deep learning algorithms such as neural networks have the ability to reconstruct missing piezometric data and thus build a database that can be used as calibration data for climate projections sarhadi et al 2016 the deep learning algorithms are designed as black box models in which the input and output data are linked by a large number of weight and bias matrices defined in the neurons constituting the hidden layers rajaee et al 2019 weights and biases in deep learning models are determined in the training process through their ability to match the network response to the output of training data by using an optimization algorithm once the training process is complete the validation test is performed on another subset of data not used in the training stage to check the generalization of the network which depends on the quality and quantity of the training data as well as the architecture of the networks in the realm of groundwater level reconstruction various algorithms and architectures have been tested in recent years lallahem et al 2005 applied the multilayer perceptron architecture mlp to predict groundwater fluctuations in the fractured aquifer in northern france using precipitation evapotranspiration and piezometric data as training data the same approach was used by trichakis et al 2011 in predicting the level of the edwards karst aquifer based on the precipitation temperature pumping and groundwater level data ghose et al 2018 opted for the prediction of the groundwater level with a recursive neural network in which the temporal dependence of the variables is included in the prediction using the previous output at time t 1 in the prediction of the variable at time t this incorporation of long term dependencies significantly improves groundwater prediction compared to the mlp network according to a comparative study conducted by coulibaly et al 2001 as a more advanced type of rnn lstm has been applied to predict the water fluctuations of the hetao irrigation district in china by using precipitation temperature evaporation and monthly water diversion recorded over 14 years zhang et al 2018 by comparisons between those two networks bowes et al 2019 reported a better performance of lstm over rnn in modeling and predicting the gwl response to storm evens at norfolk city virginia lstm was also applied for predicting the water levels of baltic river and long creek with precipitation relative humidity mean temperature stream level stream flow evapotranspiration heat degree as input data collected over 6 years afzaal et al 2020 this manuscript discusses lstm relevance for reconstruction of missing data from a network of 31 piezometers installed to monitor water fluctuations in a highly heterogeneous porous fractured and karstic regional aquifer of upper normandy france these piezometric fluctuations describe a strong spatio temporal heterogeneity of water dynamics in the aquifer over 50 years here reconstruction is based exclusively on the use of gwls collected over long periods on the same piezometers to fill the short 2 years and long 47 years gaps in the other piezometers 2 study area and data acquisition the efficiency of the lstm algorithm in the historical reconstruction of groundwater fluctuation data will be studied from its application on a set of hydraulic data acquired on a part of the piezometric network used in the monitoring of the normandy karstic basin this basin is highly karstified and constitutes the main source of water supply in the region slimani et al 2009 the study area is located in northwestern normandy france where 31 piezometers were installed at different dates to monitor piezometric fluctuations in the normandy karstic aquifer fig 1 this aquifer is unconfined and is covered by superficial geological layers of loess and clay with flints that are disturbed by the presence of sinkholes and crypto sinkholes jardani et al 2006 valdes et al 2014 this geological cover controls the recharge processes of the karstic aquifer with rapid infiltration through sinkholes and slow infiltration through the superficial formation that forms a perched aquifer during rainy periods these two dynamics can be observed in the records of groundwater level on piezometers and water flux on karst springs el janyani et al 2013 valdes et al 2014 the hydraulic data analyzed in this study are composed of 31 time series of water levels recorded on a set of piezometers distributed over the area fig 2 however the duration of the records is not uniform some records are long and last almost 50 years as in the case of 8 piezometers and others are very short and cover only 3 to 5 years in addition some piezometers have been withdrawn from monitoring networks in recent years i e piezometers no5 n 11b n 15 but they provide valuable information on past groundwater fluctuations fig 3 provides details on the duration of each series the sampling frequency is also not uniform with weekly measurements for the first 35 years 1970 2005 and daily measurements for the last 15 years the mean of gwl fluctuations observed in these piezometers can reach to 30 times of difference which proves the existence of a strong hydraulic gradient particularly between the upstream and downstream compartments the amplitude of the fluctuations over time also varies significantly from about 0 1 to 10 m these contrasts in the fluctuations are due to the degree of karstification of the hydrosystem hydraulic measurements share and carry certain common characteristics linking to the regional climate conditions which can allow the deep learning algorithm to establish links between the gwl data measured in various piezometers without requiring the incorporation of the precipitation signal in this process 3 methodology and model design 3 1 long short term memory long short term memory lstm is an enhanced architecture of the recurrent neural network rnn that has been designed to process the time dependent variables presented in time series hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 this type of network has the advantage of incorporating past information into the prediction of the future state of the variable when the input data have certain dependencies in the rnn the memory effect is taken into account by using an unrolled loop cell which allows the previous information to flow into the prediction of the next step however the way it is structured does not allow an effective processing of long term dependencies as its learning process leads to the vanishing gradients during the back propagation to overcome this obstacle the lstm networks have been developed with an efficient structure comprising three gates input gates output gates and forget gates that ensures the preservation of previous information with a stable gradient calculation see fig 4 on these three gates within a cell state the information is processed by a sequential computation using the following equations hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 felix et al 2000 1 i t σ w i x t u i h t 1 b i f t σ w f x t u f h t 1 b f o t σ w o x t u o h t 1 b o c t t a n h w c x t u c h t 1 b c c t f t c t 1 i t c t h t o t tanh c t where xt designates the input variable at the current time step ht is the output of the previous cell ct 1 is the previous cell state which provides the past information these parameters are used with a set of the weight matrices and bias vectors in the logistic sigmoid σ and tanh functions at the input forget and outputs gates all these weights and bias vectors are estimated during the learning process in matching the training data by using adam optimizer regarding the choice of the optimal structure of lstm networks to obtain accurate predictions a single hidden layer is adopted in which number of nodes is determined according to the following rule modified from lallahem et al 2005 2 n in 1 n hid n hid 1 n out 1 α n train where nin denotes the number of nodes in the input layer nout is the number of nodes in output layer and nhid is number of nodes in the hidden layer ntrain is number of training data α is a coefficient varies from 1 to over 10 in this study to avoid overfitting α is given a value higher than 2 as the training data doubles the degrees of freedom in the training process in this study the training applies adam algorithm with constant learning rate of 0 002 and a longest sequence option in the mini batch the learning takes a half of minute in matlab running in a dell precision t5810 with a single gpu nvidia quadro k2200 4 data calibration before the start of the training process the dataset of groundwater level in the 31 piezometers from 1970 to 2020 are resampled to a weekly time step and normalized with following formulation 3 h i m h i m h m max i 1 n h i m h m where h i m h m are the measurement i and the mean of the whole series of n measurements in the piezometer m respectively this normalization facilitates learning by re scaling all data between plus and minus one as plotted in fig 5 even the original time series show a changing range of amplitudes their normalized fluctuations show similar low frequency behaviors these similarities can be exploited to learn how to reconstruct missing piezometric data or extrapolate data indeed to achieve a reliable prediction the training data must contain sufficient information and characteristics that are representative of the variability of the hydraulic data in the piezometer to be predicted for this reason the choice of the data portion that will be used to feed the networks is a first step in the process in terms of data availability and their concordance with the targeted piezometer data hence in order to examine the impact of training data on the quality of predictions different strategies will be discussed where various piezometers will be integrated into the predictions the quality of these predictions is assessed and analyzed using three criteria the root mean square error 4 rmse i 1 n h i h i 2 n where h i and h i are predicted and observation groundwater levels n is number of testing values the correlation coefficient 5 corr test i 1 n h i h h i h i 1 n h i h 2 i 1 n h i h 2 where h and h are average predicted and observation groundwater levels of testing data in some tests the observation is referred in a neighboring piezometer to validate the prediction in the targeted piezometer and the correlation between two series is defined as 6 corr m k i 1 n h i m h m h i k h k i 1 n h i m h m 2 i 1 n h i k h k 2 where h i m h i k are measurement i in the piezometer m and piezometer k and their means are h m and h k 5 validation of the network the objective of this study is to use a statistical learning approach to effectively predict groundwater level fluctuation in a piezometer by analyzing hydraulic data acquired from a network of piezometers used in the learning process this network of piezometers consists of 11 piezometers distributed over the study area with the longest observation time scale as shown in fig 6 this dataset is representative of the main hydrodynamic characteristics observed in all the piezometers studied with mean water levels varying from 20 to 150 m and amplitudes ranging from 0 2 to 10 m graphical analysis of these time series shows a certain similarity in the fluctuations particularly during major events characterized by a significant rise or fall in water level such as the maxima of years 1976 1988 1996 and 2002 and the other minima of years 1977 1992 and 2006 this proves that the piezometers are located in the same hydrological compartment although the amplitude and response time to these extreme events remain different and are strongly influenced by the local hydrological contexts such as the degree of karstification around the piezometers and the hydraulic connectivity of the piezometers with the surface karstic sinkholes in general the signatures of low frequency fluctuations are shared on the majority of piezometers while high frequency fluctuations show a behavior that is difficult and complex to identify over time for more details the analysis of correlations between data series over time is presented in fig 7 the analysis is carried out over the first and last 15 years in order to clarify the relationship between piezometers in space and time the correlations established over the first 15 years of data 1975 1990 show the presence of a strong relationship between the data from neighboring piezometers located in the western part of the study area piezometer 1 3 8 9 10 12 17 with a correlation coefficient varying between 0 8 and 1 however the spatial proximity between piezometers does not always imply the presence of a correlation as shown by the case of the 20 21 piezometers which have a poor correlation despite their proximity in general the presence or lack of correlation is an element primarily associated with the hydrodynamic conditions of the environment in which the piezometers are installed which in turn are controlled by hydraulic conductivity in this context where porosity conditions the dynamics of the flows two transfer modalities can take place the first one is fast and is focused on the karstic conduits which are more frequently connected with the sinkholes and the second one is slow and diffuse in the matrix and small cracks therefore piezometers placed on karstic conduits are characterized by a high temporal variability carrying information on short term rainfall events in addition to the long term climatic variations that may also appear in piezometric records with low transmissivity the climatic information that is the origin of these fluctuations can be expressed on all the piezometers but in a different way in terms of amplitude and time response therefore the use of the correlation criterion to select the piezometers to be served in learning is not a trustworthy criterion as these correlations between piezometers have been altered over time due to the accentuation of the anthropogenic factors related to urbanization agricultural practice and intensive exploitation of water resources these factors can lead to significant changes in time and space in the recharge process and regional groundwater flows all these considerations lead us to not rely on correlation as a selection criterion for training piezometers and to believe that all piezometers can be used in this process in anyway the impact of the initial correlation between the input and output data on the quality of the predictions will be explored as well as the impact of the number of hidden layer on the prediction case of the gwl in piezometer n 10 using neighboring piezometers 6 impact of correlation between input and output data to understand the influence of the correlation between the input and output data on the accuracy of the prediction the observation in a single piezometer is used to predict its neighbor as shown in fig 8 the input data come from the observations in piezometer no9 no3 and no12 successively the training data are the 15 year 1975 1990 observations with a correlation between input and output in these three piezometers of 0 54 0 89 and 0 94 respectively the corresponding testing data are longer which composes observations in 30 years 1990 2020 lstm networks adopts a single hidden layer which consists of 25 65 nodes α 10 and their results are detailed in table 1 the evaluation criteria for these predictions show their dependence on the initial quality of the correlation between input and output with a clear improvement of the prediction when the data are well correlated fig 8 a b c however when the correlation is relatively low the prediction only identifies the overall fluctuation trend of the target piezometer therefore it is reasonable to use a piezometer with correlated data if the purpose of the prediction is to retrieve the details of the high frequency fluctuations the results also highlight the influence of the changing correlation over time in fig 8 b the prediction is badly reconstructed for the last 15 years 2005 2020 while the correlation between input and output no 3 and no10 during this test period is much weaker than for training 1975 1990 as is the prediction for the case n 1 and n 10 as shown in table 1 this can be explained by the fact that not all the features of aquifer dynamics in recent decades have been captured in the model derived from earlier years data on the other hand the correlation n 12 and n 10 remains almost identical over the two periods see fig 7 so that the learning process is complete which explains the good prediction of the fluctuations in fig 8 c 7 impact of amount of training data in this section the effect of the number of piezometers used in the training process is examined in relationship with the reliability of predictions in this case the learning will include more gwl data from neighboring piezometers to predict the water fluctuations in the piezometer n 10 thus three predictions are performed corresponding to three distinct training data sizes consisting of 3 6 and 10 piezometers the prediction results from these multiple time series are reported in the fig 9 and the table 1 show a clear improvement in the accuracy over those obtained from a single piezometer this tendency is identifiable in table 1 for following tests 1st 2nd 3th 4th 7th 8th 9th 12th 13th 15th the use of multiple series provides a good generalization because they offer the possibility to learn from multiple features that could not be seen with a single piezometer however this proportionality between the increase in the number of series involved in learning and the improvement in the quality of the predictions is not always respected as shown in table 1 particularly for predictions involving 6 piezometers in test 16 which are not as good as those of test 12 obtained only using 3 piezometers the conclusion to be drawn from these analyses is that the quality of the prediction is not only conditioned by the volume of training data in some cases the incorporation of unrelated data can negatively affect the accuracy because it will disturb the appropriate information therefore data quality is also a crucial factor in prediction that should not be underestimated in this case the combination of 10 piezometers in the training provides an accurate prediction corrtest 0 98 of the water level in piezometer no10 so this strategy will be adopted to predict the other piezometers dealt in the following sections 8 impact of number of nodes in the hidden layer in this section the effect of the number of nodes constituting the hidden layers on the quality of predictions is analyzed in general the choice of neural network properties is often made through trial and error analysis for that the performance of networks is tested using several numbers of nodes by changing the coefficient α from 3 to 15 see eq 2 and the results are listed in table 1 the number of nodes in the hidden layer is dependent on degrees of freedom in the training process when the node in the layer is relatively small this implies a low degree of freedoms that may prevent the networks to reach a convergence however in the opposite case with an important degree of freedoms can lead to overfitting issue as this investigation is done with a number of input variables is 3 to 15 times higher than the degrees of freedom the accuracy of the predictions varies only slightly with α with an optimal value around 5 10 9 result and discussion after the sensitivity analysis of the lstm networks and the implementation of the best strategy for predicting groundwater levels this section is devoted to the application of this strategy to the recovery of missing hydraulic data over 50 years in the piezometric network of the study area in this network some observations presenting a short discontinuity will be first completed from the available data and later all exploited to predict shorter observations in other piezometers 9 1 test 1 complete series with a short discontinuity some series with minor gaps of 2 to 5 years is firstly filled and then these completed series are used to predict other series with significant observation gaps these predictions are based on learning complete data from seven piezometers some representative prediction results are shown in fig 10 and the test evaluations are detailed in table 2 the lstm network is trained using all the hydraulic data acquired over 15 20 years then tested to complete the observations over 6 8 years before extending the prediction to complete the sequence the network includes a hidden layer with 80 290 nodes α about 3 10 to optimize use of data the prediction is first made for piezometer n 5 from 7 available piezometers n 1 3 8 9 10 17 22 the predictions of n 12 20 21 23 will then include data of n 5 in the training the training data do not covered the predicted data of n 5 see table 2 for details the predictions obtained are globally of satisfactory accuracy when the trained models arrive to identify the complexity of the hydrodynamic features in the predicted piezometers the recovered time series are relatively short compared to the total length of the series however this reconstruction is crucial to provide more data to predict other series with significant gaps in the next step the data from these 12 piezometers are recalled extracting shorter observations from other piezometers in this test missing measurements in 4 piezometers using 12 piezometers are predicted by applying the previous configuration the lstm network is trained by data of 10 20 years and its efficiency is tested over 8 10 years see fig 11 details of the quality of the predictions on the test data are presented in table 3 the predictions are highly correlated with observed fluctuations with small errors by rmse despite the fact that the series studied have different characteristics and changing also over time the training data contains a large amount of information to decrypt the complexities of each type of data and to provide a satisfactory reconstruction of missing data 9 2 test 2 predict long missing periods in this section the series of eight piezometers are completed with a long void in records of nearly 30 years using data from 16 piezometers that include both real and recovered data the network is trained from the 10 year data and validated on the 10 years of data in fig 12 some representative time series for the 8 predicted piezometers is illustrated and details of the prediction quality of the data tests are shown in table 4 as noted above neighboring piezometers are often well correlated and share the same hydrogeological characteristics in this test these neighboring piezometers is not included in the training but use them for validating the prediction as shown in fig 12 b c the predictions obtained are reliable according to the evaluation criteria and their comparisons with neighboring piezometers the prediction result from piezometer 16a reveals a good reconstitution of the observed data but it is also affected by a sudden and unexplained increase in the water level in 1987 this local effect in the test data did not occur in the training data it is therefore a limitation of the predictive model that can be remedied by using additional metrological data such as rainfall and temperature that are not available in this study the comparison with its neighbor shows a concordance in low frequency fluctuations on the other hand it is difficult to establish a correlation between the high frequency fluctuations that may be intrinsic characteristics of each piezometer for this reason the correlation coefficient between them is not relatively high corr16a 16b 0 71 all of these results will be used to predict the fluctuations in the remaining 7 piezometers in the next section 9 3 test 3 long predictions from very short observation for training previous reconstructions have allowed us to build a hydraulic database with 24 piezometers that are sufficient to attempt the recovery of the abandoned piezometers where recordings were made over a very short period of 3 years 2017 2020 in this sort of prediction with few data is so difficult to establish a generalization and validation of the networks to avoid this issue the lack of data in the target piezometer will be counterbalanced by the use of observation in nearby piezometers the validation of the approach is conducted on long series with only a short period of data used in the learning process some results of this type of prediction on time series with few data are shown in fig 13 and calibration details are shown in table 5 the discussion begins with the predictions of piezometer no 4 where only three years of data are available and used in training and the validation is done by a comparison with data from neighboring piezometer no 5 which is excluded from training data the result is shown in fig 13 a where the reproduction of training data is excellent but this does not mean that the generalization is also perfect to verify the quality of these predictions some of them are compared with the data from the nearest piezometer this comparison shows a correlation coefficient corr4 5 0 88 which means that the prediction is successful the data from piezometer no 5 is not directly exploited in the training of this test but it has been used in previous recoveries for other piezometers so some of these features may be included indirectly in this training operation the same strategy is adopted for the remaining piezometers no 26b and no 28c which are located at different places in the study area the network is established using 2 5 years of data but in this case the available data covers 17 years allowing us to retain sufficient data for validation data from a nearby piezometer is also incorporated into the validation process and the results are shown in fig 13 b c the prediction is encouraging even using only short data in the formation the network was able to match the test period fluctuations with a correlation of 0 92 and 0 97 respectively the prediction is also consistent with neighboring piezometers with corr 0 84 and 0 97 respectively the tests prove that this approach can be applied to make long predictions from very short training data this section is closed by discussing the reconstruction of the data in piezometer no19 which represents a low correlation on the validation data corr 0 64 as mentioned in section 4 1 using the combined hydraulic data from several piezometers in the learning process increases the risk of including impertinent data that will be a source of noise despite this the prediction for no 19 is made with a corr 0 64 which is slightly higher than the maximum correlation of the observed data with respect to the others 0 57 the measurements recorded on this piezometer no 19 are poorly correlated with the observations from the other piezometers average correlation 0 41 may be related to the fact that piezometer no19 is located in a hydrogeological context that is different from the rest of the piezometers used in the training this can be explained by its proximity to the sea which has a high tidal range of up to 8 m in fact this piezometer has the lowest piezometric mean compared to the rest of the 31 piezometers in comparison with the neighboring piezometer n 17 which is closer to the sea 3 km from the coast but its average of 49 7 m is seven times higher than that of piezometer n 19 it can therefore be concluded that the piezometer n 19 has a different hydrodynamic behavior from the piezometers involved in the training and to reconstruct its fluctuations it is necessary to re form a network with piezometers located on the downstream part at the interface with the sea this driving influence of tidal regimes on gwl at coastal regions are also confirmed in other studies by bowes et al 2019 at virginia us and taormina et al 2012 at venice lagoon italy 10 conclusion in this paper the approach adopts the lstm which is one of the most efficient deep learning algorithms in time series processing to identify missing data in groundwater records the approach was applied to a set of hydraulic data collected with part of the piezometer network installed to monitor groundwater fluctuations in the karstic aquifer in upper normandy these piezometers have different recording durations some have a long recording duration of 50 years others have been abandoned so they only have a very short recording duration of 3 to 10 years the implementation of the lstm relies on the use of water level data in some piezometers to form and build the network to retrieve missing data from other piezometers this tool does not require the use of meteorological data such as rainfall and temperature in training operation the main points that emerge from the use of lstm in this study are as follows this approach is relevant for reconstructing the gwl fluctuation with satisfactory accuracy over long periods of time from even very short observations with a correlation coefficient varied from 0 64 to 0 99 and rmse from 0 07 m to 1 08 m the accuracy of the predictions depends on the quality of the training data such as the initial correlation between input and output as well as the duration and number of piezometric series used in the training it is therefore crucial that the piezometers are in the same hydrogeological context and that they share certain hydrodynamic characteristics to facilitate reconstruction the use of unreliable data in the learning process with contrasting characteristics what are observed on the predicted piezometers will lead to a poor prediction the properties of the network in terms of number of layers and number of neurons can also influence the predictions and the choice of these parameters can be obtained by analyzing the quality of the predictions of different configurations the hydraulic head outcome of the model can be employed to enhance predictions of gwl itself in the future associate the modelling of other processes in the subsurface such as flow field or predict the transport of contaminant in the groundwater in future works the prediction can be extended to calibrate for every point in considering a hybrid model where a mathematic model probably joints with a physic based approach including information of surface subsurface conditions in the real field finally considering the scarcity of long term observational groundwater data and the complexity of generating simulations using classically used physics based or conceptual modeling approaches it will also be critical to explore the capabilities of deep learning techniques for long term reconstruction of groundwater levels this is mandatory to tackle the issue of understanding the impact of low frequency climate variability and climate change on water resources availability credit authorship contribution statement m t vu conceptualization methodology software data curation writing original

groundwater level gwl over long time periods is critical in understanding the variability of groundwater resources in the present context of global changes however in normandy france for example gwls have only been systematically monitored for 20 to 50 years this study evaluates long short term memory lstm neural network modeling to reconstruct gwls fill gaps and extend existing time series the approach is illustrated by using available monitoring fluctuations in piezometers implanted in the chalk aquifer in the normandy region northern france here gwl data recorded over 50 years at 31 piezometers in northwestern normandy is employed to perform gwl prediction to optimize the network performance the most influential factors that impact the accuracy of prediction are first determined such as the network architecture data quantity and quality the resulting network is adopted to reconstruct measurements in the piezometers step by step with an increment of missing observation time the approach requires no calibration for the time lag in data processing and the implementation relies only on the groundwater level fluctuations to retrieve missing data in the targeted piezometers keywords long short term memory groundwater level hydrogeology neural network karstic aquifer normandy 1 introduction monitoring of groundwater level fluctuations over time is considered the main source of information for hydrologists to improve understanding of the evolution of aquifers and water resources across time under global change and eventually to establish water resource management strategies indeed the analysis of the groundwater level collected in a set of piezometers allows to understand the hydrodynamic behavior of the aquifer with respect to the hydrological cycle to longer term climate variability anthropogenic impacts water abstractions and to apprehend the recharge process bekesi et al 2009 valdes et al 2014 interpretation of water level variations also offers the possibility of identifying preferential flow paths with high transmissivities and detecting zones which constitute the best suited areas to be exploited and thus protecting them against any form of contamination almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 therefore management plans adopted are strongly conditioned by the number of piezometers used in monitoring and their capacity both to cover the spatial heterogeneity of the aquifer and to capture the impact of climate mutations on water storage in the long and short terms in general these management plans are drawn up on incomplete and fragmented hydraulic databases that provide only a partial understanding of the hydrosystem due to the very high cost of installing piezometers and maintaining the acquisition of hydraulic parameters over time facing the threats of climate change and the urge for establishing long term strategies for the management and preservation of the environment public authorities and the scientific community have been engaged in recent years in the construction of environmental databases anderson et al 2008 guo and lin 2016 this has led to the emergence of observatories on water resources in the world where a large number of multi parameter sensors are installed in the different compartments of the critical zone to monitor hydro physical geochemical microbiological parameters in order to study the impact of climate change hipsey et al 2015 characklis et al 2007 zacharias et al 2011 jourde et al 2011 gaillardet et al 2018 however investigating the impact of environmental and climate changes on hydrology requires long term multidecadal time series be available this has led to a number of initiatives devoted to reconstructing long term hydrological or hydrometeorological time series that are often based on the derivation of hydrological variations from long term large scale climate reanalyzes e g caillouet et al 2019 bonnet et al 2020 devers et al 2020 this is also encouraged by the emergence of data science such research fields are driven by the progress in computer technologies which have created a favorable environment for the development of machine learning techniques rajaee et al 2019 these approaches have resurfaced in recent years thanks to their ability to generate predictive models by analyzing massive data in less time machine learning applications in the geosciences are gaining popularity particularly in the prediction of groundwater fluctuations including extreme events mosavi et al 2018 indeed deep learning algorithms such as neural networks have the ability to reconstruct missing piezometric data and thus build a database that can be used as calibration data for climate projections sarhadi et al 2016 the deep learning algorithms are designed as black box models in which the input and output data are linked by a large number of weight and bias matrices defined in the neurons constituting the hidden layers rajaee et al 2019 weights and biases in deep learning models are determined in the training process through their ability to match the network response to the output of training data by using an optimization algorithm once the training process is complete the validation test is performed on another subset of data not used in the training stage to check the generalization of the network which depends on the quality and quantity of the training data as well as the architecture of the networks in the realm of groundwater level reconstruction various algorithms and architectures have been tested in recent years lallahem et al 2005 applied the multilayer perceptron architecture mlp to predict groundwater fluctuations in the fractured aquifer in northern france using precipitation evapotranspiration and piezometric data as training data the same approach was used by trichakis et al 2011 in predicting the level of the edwards karst aquifer based on the precipitation temperature pumping and groundwater level data ghose et al 2018 opted for the prediction of the groundwater level with a recursive neural network in which the temporal dependence of the variables is included in the prediction using the previous output at time t 1 in the prediction of the variable at time t this incorporation of long term dependencies significantly improves groundwater prediction compared to the mlp network according to a comparative study conducted by coulibaly et al 2001 as a more advanced type of rnn lstm has been applied to predict the water fluctuations of the hetao irrigation district in china by using precipitation temperature evaporation and monthly water diversion recorded over 14 years zhang et al 2018 by comparisons between those two networks bowes et al 2019 reported a better performance of lstm over rnn in modeling and predicting the gwl response to storm evens at norfolk city virginia lstm was also applied for predicting the water levels of baltic river and long creek with precipitation relative humidity mean temperature stream level stream flow evapotranspiration heat degree as input data collected over 6 years afzaal et al 2020 this manuscript discusses lstm relevance for reconstruction of missing data from a network of 31 piezometers installed to monitor water fluctuations in a highly heterogeneous porous fractured and karstic regional aquifer of upper normandy france these piezometric fluctuations describe a strong spatio temporal heterogeneity of water dynamics in the aquifer over 50 years here reconstruction is based exclusively on the use of gwls collected over long periods on the same piezometers to fill the short 2 years and long 47 years gaps in the other piezometers 2 study area and data acquisition the efficiency of the lstm algorithm in the historical reconstruction of groundwater fluctuation data will be studied from its application on a set of hydraulic data acquired on a part of the piezometric network used in the monitoring of the normandy karstic basin this basin is highly karstified and constitutes the main source of water supply in the region slimani et al 2009 the study area is located in northwestern normandy france where 31 piezometers were installed at different dates to monitor piezometric fluctuations in the normandy karstic aquifer fig 1 this aquifer is unconfined and is covered by superficial geological layers of loess and clay with flints that are disturbed by the presence of sinkholes and crypto sinkholes jardani et al 2006 valdes et al 2014 this geological cover controls the recharge processes of the karstic aquifer with rapid infiltration through sinkholes and slow infiltration through the superficial formation that forms a perched aquifer during rainy periods these two dynamics can be observed in the records of groundwater level on piezometers and water flux on karst springs el janyani et al 2013 valdes et al 2014 the hydraulic data analyzed in this study are composed of 31 time series of water levels recorded on a set of piezometers distributed over the area fig 2 however the duration of the records is not uniform some records are long and last almost 50 years as in the case of 8 piezometers and others are very short and cover only 3 to 5 years in addition some piezometers have been withdrawn from monitoring networks in recent years i e piezometers no5 n 11b n 15 but they provide valuable information on past groundwater fluctuations fig 3 provides details on the duration of each series the sampling frequency is also not uniform with weekly measurements for the first 35 years 1970 2005 and daily measurements for the last 15 years the mean of gwl fluctuations observed in these piezometers can reach to 30 times of difference which proves the existence of a strong hydraulic gradient particularly between the upstream and downstream compartments the amplitude of the fluctuations over time also varies significantly from about 0 1 to 10 m these contrasts in the fluctuations are due to the degree of karstification of the hydrosystem hydraulic measurements share and carry certain common characteristics linking to the regional climate conditions which can allow the deep learning algorithm to establish links between the gwl data measured in various piezometers without requiring the incorporation of the precipitation signal in this process 3 methodology and model design 3 1 long short term memory long short term memory lstm is an enhanced architecture of the recurrent neural network rnn that has been designed to process the time dependent variables presented in time series hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 this type of network has the advantage of incorporating past information into the prediction of the future state of the variable when the input data have certain dependencies in the rnn the memory effect is taken into account by using an unrolled loop cell which allows the previous information to flow into the prediction of the next step however the way it is structured does not allow an effective processing of long term dependencies as its learning process leads to the vanishing gradients during the back propagation to overcome this obstacle the lstm networks have been developed with an efficient structure comprising three gates input gates output gates and forget gates that ensures the preservation of previous information with a stable gradient calculation see fig 4 on these three gates within a cell state the information is processed by a sequential computation using the following equations hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 felix et al 2000 1 i t σ w i x t u i h t 1 b i f t σ w f x t u f h t 1 b f o t σ w o x t u o h t 1 b o c t t a n h w c x t u c h t 1 b c c t f t c t 1 i t c t h t o t tanh c t where xt designates the input variable at the current time step ht is the output of the previous cell ct 1 is the previous cell state which provides the past information these parameters are used with a set of the weight matrices and bias vectors in the logistic sigmoid σ and tanh functions at the input forget and outputs gates all these weights and bias vectors are estimated during the learning process in matching the training data by using adam optimizer regarding the choice of the optimal structure of lstm networks to obtain accurate predictions a single hidden layer is adopted in which number of nodes is determined according to the following rule modified from lallahem et al 2005 2 n in 1 n hid n hid 1 n out 1 α n train where nin denotes the number of nodes in the input layer nout is the number of nodes in output layer and nhid is number of nodes in the hidden layer ntrain is number of training data α is a coefficient varies from 1 to over 10 in this study to avoid overfitting α is given a value higher than 2 as the training data doubles the degrees of freedom in the training process in this study the training applies adam algorithm with constant learning rate of 0 002 and a longest sequence option in the mini batch the learning takes a half of minute in matlab running in a dell precision t5810 with a single gpu nvidia quadro k2200 4 data calibration before the start of the training process the dataset of groundwater level in the 31 piezometers from 1970 to 2020 are resampled to a weekly time step and normalized with following formulation 3 h i m h i m h m max i 1 n h i m h m where h i m h m are the measurement i and the mean of the whole series of n measurements in the piezometer m respectively this normalization facilitates learning by re scaling all data between plus and minus one as plotted in fig 5 even the original time series show a changing range of amplitudes their normalized fluctuations show similar low frequency behaviors these similarities can be exploited to learn how to reconstruct missing piezometric data or extrapolate data indeed to achieve a reliable prediction the training data must contain sufficient information and characteristics that are representative of the variability of the hydraulic data in the piezometer to be predicted for this reason the choice of the data portion that will be used to feed the networks is a first step in the process in terms of data availability and their concordance with the targeted piezometer data hence in order to examine the impact of training data on the quality of predictions different strategies will be discussed where various piezometers will be integrated into the predictions the quality of these predictions is assessed and analyzed using three criteria the root mean square error 4 rmse i 1 n h i h i 2 n where h i and h i are predicted and observation groundwater levels n is number of testing values the correlation coefficient 5 corr test i 1 n h i h h i h i 1 n h i h 2 i 1 n h i h 2 where h and h are average predicted and observation groundwater levels of testing data in some tests the observation is referred in a neighboring piezometer to validate the prediction in the targeted piezometer and the correlation between two series is defined as 6 corr m k i 1 n h i m h m h i k h k i 1 n h i m h m 2 i 1 n h i k h k 2 where h i m h i k are measurement i in the piezometer m and piezometer k and their means are h m and h k 5 validation of the network the objective of this study is to use a statistical learning approach to effectively predict groundwater level fluctuation in a piezometer by analyzing hydraulic data acquired from a network of piezometers used in the learning process this network of piezometers consists of 11 piezometers distributed over the study area with the longest observation time scale as shown in fig 6 this dataset is representative of the main hydrodynamic characteristics observed in all the piezometers studied with mean water levels varying from 20 to 150 m and amplitudes ranging from 0 2 to 10 m graphical analysis of these time series shows a certain similarity in the fluctuations particularly during major events characterized by a significant rise or fall in water level such as the maxima of years 1976 1988 1996 and 2002 and the other minima of years 1977 1992 and 2006 this proves that the piezometers are located in the same hydrological compartment although the amplitude and response time to these extreme events remain different and are strongly influenced by the local hydrological contexts such as the degree of karstification around the piezometers and the hydraulic connectivity of the piezometers with the surface karstic sinkholes in general the signatures of low frequency fluctuations are shared on the majority of piezometers while high frequency fluctuations show a behavior that is difficult and complex to identify over time for more details the analysis of correlations between data series over time is presented in fig 7 the analysis is carried out over the first and last 15 years in order to clarify the relationship between piezometers in space and time the correlations established over the first 15 years of data 1975 1990 show the presence of a strong relationship between the data from neighboring piezometers located in the western part of the study area piezometer 1 3 8 9 10 12 17 with a correlation coefficient varying between 0 8 and 1 however the spatial proximity between piezometers does not always imply the presence of a correlation as shown by the case of the 20 21 piezometers which have a poor correlation despite their proximity in general the presence or lack of correlation is an element primarily associated with the hydrodynamic conditions of the environment in which the piezometers are installed which in turn are controlled by hydraulic conductivity in this context where porosity conditions the dynamics of the flows two transfer modalities can take place the first one is fast and is focused on the karstic conduits which are more frequently connected with the sinkholes and the second one is slow and diffuse in the matrix and small cracks therefore piezometers placed on karstic conduits are characterized by a high temporal variability carrying information on short term rainfall events in addition to the long term climatic variations that may also appear in piezometric records with low transmissivity the climatic information that is the origin of these fluctuations can be expressed on all the piezometers but in a different way in terms of amplitude and time response therefore the use of the correlation criterion to select the piezometers to be served in learning is not a trustworthy criterion as these correlations between piezometers have been altered over time due to the accentuation of the anthropogenic factors related to urbanization agricultural practice and intensive exploitation of water resources these factors can lead to significant changes in time and space in the recharge process and regional groundwater flows all these considerations lead us to not rely on correlation as a selection criterion for training piezometers and to believe that all piezometers can be used in this process in anyway the impact of the initial correlation between the input and output data on the quality of the predictions will be explored as well as the impact of the number of hidden layer on the prediction case of the gwl in piezometer n 10 using neighboring piezometers 6 impact of correlation between input and output data to understand the influence of the correlation between the input and output data on the accuracy of the prediction the observation in a single piezometer is used to predict its neighbor as shown in fig 8 the input data come from the observations in piezometer no9 no3 and no12 successively the training data are the 15 year 1975 1990 observations with a correlation between input and output in these three piezometers of 0 54 0 89 and 0 94 respectively the corresponding testing data are longer which composes observations in 30 years 1990 2020 lstm networks adopts a single hidden layer which consists of 25 65 nodes α 10 and their results are detailed in table 1 the evaluation criteria for these predictions show their dependence on the initial quality of the correlation between input and output with a clear improvement of the prediction when the data are well correlated fig 8 a b c however when the correlation is relatively low the prediction only identifies the overall fluctuation trend of the target piezometer therefore it is reasonable to use a piezometer with correlated data if the purpose of the prediction is to retrieve the details of the high frequency fluctuations the results also highlight the influence of the changing correlation over time in fig 8 b the prediction is badly reconstructed for the last 15 years 2005 2020 while the correlation between input and output no 3 and no10 during this test period is much weaker than for training 1975 1990 as is the prediction for the case n 1 and n 10 as shown in table 1 this can be explained by the fact that not all the features of aquifer dynamics in recent decades have been captured in the model derived from earlier years data on the other hand the correlation n 12 and n 10 remains almost identical over the two periods see fig 7 so that the learning process is complete which explains the good prediction of the fluctuations in fig 8 c 7 impact of amount of training data in this section the effect of the number of piezometers used in the training process is examined in relationship with the reliability of predictions in this case the learning will include more gwl data from neighboring piezometers to predict the water fluctuations in the piezometer n 10 thus three predictions are performed corresponding to three distinct training data sizes consisting of 3 6 and 10 piezometers the prediction results from these multiple time series are reported in the fig 9 and the table 1 show a clear improvement in the accuracy over those obtained from a single piezometer this tendency is identifiable in table 1 for following tests 1st 2nd 3th 4th 7th 8th 9th 12th 13th 15th the use of multiple series provides a good generalization because they offer the possibility to learn from multiple features that could not be seen with a single piezometer however this proportionality between the increase in the number of series involved in learning and the improvement in the quality of the predictions is not always respected as shown in table 1 particularly for predictions involving 6 piezometers in test 16 which are not as good as those of test 12 obtained only using 3 piezometers the conclusion to be drawn from these analyses is that the quality of the prediction is not only conditioned by the volume of training data in some cases the incorporation of unrelated data can negatively affect the accuracy because it will disturb the appropriate information therefore data quality is also a crucial factor in prediction that should not be underestimated in this case the combination of 10 piezometers in the training provides an accurate prediction corrtest 0 98 of the water level in piezometer no10 so this strategy will be adopted to predict the other piezometers dealt in the following sections 8 impact of number of nodes in the hidden layer in this section the effect of the number of nodes constituting the hidden layers on the quality of predictions is analyzed in general the choice of neural network properties is often made through trial and error analysis for that the performance of networks is tested using several numbers of nodes by changing the coefficient α from 3 to 15 see eq 2 and the results are listed in table 1 the number of nodes in the hidden layer is dependent on degrees of freedom in the training process when the node in the layer is relatively small this implies a low degree of freedoms that may prevent the networks to reach a convergence however in the opposite case with an important degree of freedoms can lead to overfitting issue as this investigation is done with a number of input variables is 3 to 15 times higher than the degrees of freedom the accuracy of the predictions varies only slightly with α with an optimal value around 5 10 9 result and discussion after the sensitivity analysis of the lstm networks and the implementation of the best strategy for predicting groundwater levels this section is devoted to the application of this strategy to the recovery of missing hydraulic data over 50 years in the piezometric network of the study area in this network some observations presenting a short discontinuity will be first completed from the available data and later all exploited to predict shorter observations in other piezometers 9 1 test 1 complete series with a short discontinuity some series with minor gaps of 2 to 5 years is firstly filled and then these completed series are used to predict other series with significant observation gaps these predictions are based on learning complete data from seven piezometers some representative prediction results are shown in fig 10 and the test evaluations are detailed in table 2 the lstm network is trained using all the hydraulic data acquired over 15 20 years then tested to complete the observations over 6 8 years before extending the prediction to complete the sequence the network includes a hidden layer with 80 290 nodes α about 3 10 to optimize use of data the prediction is first made for piezometer n 5 from 7 available piezometers n 1 3 8 9 10 17 22 the predictions of n 12 20 21 23 will then include data of n 5 in the training the training data do not covered the predicted data of n 5 see table 2 for details the predictions obtained are globally of satisfactory accuracy when the trained models arrive to identify the complexity of the hydrodynamic features in the predicted piezometers the recovered time series are relatively short compared to the total length of the series however this reconstruction is crucial to provide more data to predict other series with significant gaps in the next step the data from these 12 piezometers are recalled extracting shorter observations from other piezometers in this test missing measurements in 4 piezometers using 12 piezometers are predicted by applying the previous configuration the lstm network is trained by data of 10 20 years and its efficiency is tested over 8 10 years see fig 11 details of the quality of the predictions on the test data are presented in table 3 the predictions are highly correlated with observed fluctuations with small errors by rmse despite the fact that the series studied have different characteristics and changing also over time the training data contains a large amount of information to decrypt the complexities of each type of data and to provide a satisfactory reconstruction of missing data 9 2 test 2 predict long missing periods in this section the series of eight piezometers are completed with a long void in records of nearly 30 years using data from 16 piezometers that include both real and recovered data the network is trained from the 10 year data and validated on the 10 years of data in fig 12 some representative time series for the 8 predicted piezometers is illustrated and details of the prediction quality of the data tests are shown in table 4 as noted above neighboring piezometers are often well correlated and share the same hydrogeological characteristics in this test these neighboring piezometers is not included in the training but use them for validating the prediction as shown in fig 12 b c the predictions obtained are reliable according to the evaluation criteria and their comparisons with neighboring piezometers the prediction result from piezometer 16a reveals a good reconstitution of the observed data but it is also affected by a sudden and unexplained increase in the water level in 1987 this local effect in the test data did not occur in the training data it is therefore a limitation of the predictive model that can be remedied by using additional metrological data such as rainfall and temperature that are not available in this study the comparison with its neighbor shows a concordance in low frequency fluctuations on the other hand it is difficult to establish a correlation between the high frequency fluctuations that may be intrinsic characteristics of each piezometer for this reason the correlation coefficient between them is not relatively high corr16a 16b 0 71 all of these results will be used to predict the fluctuations in the remaining 7 piezometers in the next section 9 3 test 3 long predictions from very short observation for training previous reconstructions have allowed us to build a hydraulic database with 24 piezometers that are sufficient to attempt the recovery of the abandoned piezometers where recordings were made over a very short period of 3 years 2017 2020 in this sort of prediction with few data is so difficult to establish a generalization and validation of the networks to avoid this issue the lack of data in the target piezometer will be counterbalanced by the use of observation in nearby piezometers the validation of the approach is conducted on long series with only a short period of data used in the learning process some results of this type of prediction on time series with few data are shown in fig 13 and calibration details are shown in table 5 the discussion begins with the predictions of piezometer no 4 where only three years of data are available and used in training and the validation is done by a comparison with data from neighboring piezometer no 5 which is excluded from training data the result is shown in fig 13 a where the reproduction of training data is excellent but this does not mean that the generalization is also perfect to verify the quality of these predictions some of them are compared with the data from the nearest piezometer this comparison shows a correlation coefficient corr4 5 0 88 which means that the prediction is successful the data from piezometer no 5 is not directly exploited in the training of this test but it has been used in previous recoveries for other piezometers so some of these features may be included indirectly in this training operation the same strategy is adopted for the remaining piezometers no 26b and no 28c which are located at different places in the study area the network is established using 2 5 years of data but in this case the available data covers 17 years allowing us to retain sufficient data for validation data from a nearby piezometer is also incorporated into the validation process and the results are shown in fig 13 b c the prediction is encouraging even using only short data in the formation the network was able to match the test period fluctuations with a correlation of 0 92 and 0 97 respectively the prediction is also consistent with neighboring piezometers with corr 0 84 and 0 97 respectively the tests prove that this approach can be applied to make long predictions from very short training data this section is closed by discussing the reconstruction of the data in piezometer no19 which represents a low correlation on the validation data corr 0 64 as mentioned in section 4 1 using the combined hydraulic data from several piezometers in the learning process increases the risk of including impertinent data that will be a source of noise despite this the prediction for no 19 is made with a corr 0 64 which is slightly higher than the maximum correlation of the observed data with respect to the others 0 57 the measurements recorded on this piezometer no 19 are poorly correlated with the observations from the other piezometers average correlation 0 41 may be related to the fact that piezometer no19 is located in a hydrogeological context that is different from the rest of the piezometers used in the training this can be explained by its proximity to the sea which has a high tidal range of up to 8 m in fact this piezometer has the lowest piezometric mean compared to the rest of the 31 piezometers in comparison with the neighboring piezometer n 17 which is closer to the sea 3 km from the coast but its average of 49 7 m is seven times higher than that of piezometer n 19 it can therefore be concluded that the piezometer n 19 has a different hydrodynamic behavior from the piezometers involved in the training and to reconstruct its fluctuations it is necessary to re form a network with piezometers located on the downstream part at the interface with the sea this driving influence of tidal regimes on gwl at coastal regions are also confirmed in other studies by bowes et al 2019 at virginia us and taormina et al 2012 at venice lagoon italy 10 conclusion in this paper the approach adopts the lstm which is one of the most efficient deep learning algorithms in time series processing to identify missing data in groundwater records the approach was applied to a set of hydraulic data collected with part of the piezometer network installed to monitor groundwater fluctuations in the karstic aquifer in upper normandy these piezometers have different recording durations some have a long recording duration of 50 years others have been abandoned so they only have a very short recording duration of 3 to 10 years the implementation of the lstm relies on the use of water level data in some piezometers to form and build the network to retrieve missing data from other piezometers this tool does not require the use of meteorological data such as rainfall and temperature in training operation the main points that emerge from the use of lstm in this study are as follows this approach is relevant for reconstructing the gwl fluctuation with satisfactory accuracy over long periods of time from even very short observations with a correlation coefficient varied from 0 64 to 0 99 and rmse from 0 07 m to 1 08 m the accuracy of the predictions depends on the quality of the training data such as the initial correlation between input and output as well as the duration and number of piezometric series used in the training it is therefore crucial that the piezometers are in the same hydrogeological context and that they share certain hydrodynamic characteristics to facilitate reconstruction the use of unreliable data in the learning process with contrasting characteristics what are observed on the predicted piezometers will lead to a poor prediction the properties of the network in terms of number of layers and number of neurons can also influence the predictions and the choice of these parameters can be obtained by analyzing the quality of the predictions of different configurations the hydraulic head outcome of the model can be employed to enhance predictions of gwl itself in the future associate the modelling of other processes in the subsurface such as flow field or predict the transport of contaminant in the groundwater in future works the prediction can be extended to calibrate for every point in considering a hybrid model where a mathematic model probably joints with a physic based approach including information of surface subsurface conditions in the real field finally considering the scarcity of long term observational groundwater data and the complexity of generating simulations using classically used physics based or conceptual modeling approaches it will also be critical to explore the capabilities of deep learning techniques for long term reconstruction of groundwater levels this is mandatory to tackle the issue of understanding the impact of low frequency climate variability and climate change on water resources availability credit authorship contribution statement m t vu conceptualization methodology software data curation writing original

4663,accurate estimation of snow mass or snow water equivalent swe over space and time is required for global and regional predictions of the effects of climate change this work investigates whether integration of remotely sensed terrestrial water storage tws information which is derived from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace can improve swe and streamflow simulations within a

2018 2015 van dijk et al 2014 zaitchik et al 2008 forman et al 2012 and su et al 2010 investigated the potential for grace derived tws observations in the data assimilation framework to represent snow budgets accurately they found that grace data assimilation improved modeled swe in some portions of north american basins e g the mackenzie basin for swe estimates forman et al 2012 achieved a modest reduction in root mean square difference rmsd in the liard basin rmsd 24 mm for ol and rmsd 19 6 mm for da xu et al 2015 applied a one dimensional version of the ensemble kalman filter 1d enkf over the great lakes by incorporating smos soil moisture retrievals into the mesh model results highlighted that the developed da methodology can improve moisture estimation for both the soil surface and root zone over the crop dominated grids as development of the mesh model continues some researchers and collaborators have focused upon incorporating remotely sensed products into the modeling system especially for forecasting applications xu et al 2015 yassin et al 2017 given the importance of grace observations in improving changes in estimated terrestrial water storage and its compartments in different lsms a question arises whether integrating grace observations into the mesh is truly effective given the coarse spatial and temporal resolutions of grace observations a robust data assimilation method should be implemented to improve mesh model predictions the first specific objective evaluated how the assimilation of basin averaged grace observations could improve mesh model predictions of swe at both basin and gridded spatial resolution scales our second specific objective examined the influence of the developed assimilation framework on streamflow simulation to achieve these objectives the ensemble kalman smoother enks evensen and van leeuwen 2000 framework was implemented in the snow dominated liard basin of northwestern canada validation of results was conducted for six years from october 2008 to october 2014 using independent data that were collected at different scales gridded basin scale and station observations the general performance of the ensemble based mesh grace data assimilation system is discussed in details regarding the reduction of model uncertainty and the disaggregation of grace observations during the cold season in section 2 the study area and the different data are described together with the mesh model in section 3 the details of the developed methodology are explained sections 4 and 5 present the results and discussion finally the conclusions of this study are provided in section 6 2 data and model 2 1 study area the study domain that was selected is the liard river basin which is a sub basin of the much larger mackenzie river basin fig 1 the watershed of the liard river drains portions of british columbia and alberta and the yukon and northwest territories of boreal northwestern canada spanning longitudes 132 w to 118 w and latitudes 57 n to 63 n land cover of the liard basin is dominated by sub polar needleleaf and mixed forest 71 and grasslands 16 followed by barren land 7 and wetlands 4 a small fraction of its area is covered by water bodies 1 5 and glaciers 0 5 the basin is about 275 000 km2 in area which is greater than the effective area of 150 000 km2 that can be resolved by grace at mid and high latitudes forman et al 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 two main reasons motivated selection of the liard basin as the case study first preliminary analyses not presented in this study revealed that grace twsa seasonal amplitudes in the liard basin are dominated by snow mass changes during the snow season bahrami et al 2020 second contributions of surface water mass changes from lakes reservoirs and river storage to total water storage is not significant given the very low surface coverage contributions of water bodies and wetlands in the basin 2 2 grace tws datasets the gridded 1 1 grace derived twsa data are publicly available from october 2008 to october 2014 through the nasa jet propulsion laboratory jpl tellus website swenson 2012 we used release 5 rl05 level 3 monthly data products that were provided by three data centers including the center for space research csr of the university of texas at austin the deutsches geoforschungszentrum gfz the german research centre for geosciences potsdam germany and jpl pasadena ca usa to effectively reduce the noise in the grace data we used the arithmetic mean of all three data products sakumura et al 2014 because of filtering and truncation of grace twsa observations the surface mass variation signal is attenuated swenson and wahr 2006 gridded 1 1 multiplicative gain factors that are provided by tellus were applied to the original grace tws retrievals to restore the signal loss landerer and swenson 2012 the linear trends that were related to glacial isostatic adjustment gia have been removed from grace tellus mass grids based on the model by geruo et al 2013 2 3 snow water equivalent products to evaluate the performance of the swe estimates from mesh we made use of data that were provided by the canadian meteorological centre cmc dorval qc daily gridded cmc snow depth analysis has been provided by cmc at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 24 km 24 km over the northern hemisphere from october 2008 to october 2014 brown and brasnett 2010 the cmc daily snow depth analysis brasnett 1999 is based upon optimal interpolation of in situ daily snow observations and the initial guess the initial guess field is provided by a simple snow accumulation and melt model using analyzed temperature and forecasted precipitation from the canadian global environmental multiscale gem forecast model monthly swe estimates for the october to june period of each year brown and mote 2009 were derived from monthly averaged snow depth analyses using the corresponding mean monthly snow density lookup table that was identified by sturm et al 1995 the cmc swe gridded product is often considered as one of the most useful global data sources for evaluating swe simulations in different studies forman et al 2012 seo et al 2010 su et al 2010 toure et al 2016 verseghy et al 2017 verseghy and mackay 2017 zhang et al 2014 it should be noted that the cmc swe product has some limitations including an imperfect model accumulation and melt model and coarse atmospheric forcing together with a paucity of snow stations at higher latitudes swenson and lawrence 2012 toure et al 2016 in northern latitudes 55 n where precipitation gauges are sparsely located brown et al 2010 snow analysis depends upon gem forcing precipitation rather than snow observations brown and brasnett 2010 in these areas gem tends to be biased low 0 1 0 4 mm day 1 in comparison to the climate research unit cru university of east anglia norwich england observational database verseghy et al 2017 2 4 snow survey observations automated snow survey observations are collected and transmitted hourly through the data collection system on geostationary satellites operated by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the station based observations are acquired by the british columbia ministry of environment daily swe observations are publicly available since november 2012 through the provincial snow survey network website in this study monthly averaged swe observations during the snow seasons november to april overlapping the study period i e 2013 and 2014 are used to further evaluate the data assimilation performance the available three automatic snow monitoring stations for this study are the 4c22p kiwigana climate the 4c21p two island climate and 4c20p sierra climate they are shown in fig 1 2 5 streamflow observations streamflow observations are available from the water survey of canada wsc website http www ec gc ca rhc wsc three streamflow records are selected going from the upper basin to its mouth the liard river at lower crossing the liard river at fort liard and the liard river near the mouth see fig 1 gauge based streamflow observations are used for both the calibration of mesh parameters and the evaluation of the grace da procedure 2 6 mesh model the prognostic semi distributed hydrological land surface model h lsm that was used in this study was developed by pietroniro et al 2007 the current version of the mesh model contains an integrated lsm and a river routing system the geophysical heterogeneity within each grid cell can be defined based upon a digital elevation model dem land cover classification and soil characteristics davison et al 2019 the topographic data are based upon the canadian digital elevation data cded 2016 at a scale of 1 50 000 land cover information is extracted from the land cover of canada lcc 2010 which is produced based on landsat satellite images by the canada centre for mapping and earth observation ccmeo formerly canada centre for remote sensing ccrs soil texture information comes from soil landscapes of canada slc 2010 data of agriculture and agri food canada in the mesh model the desired basin is divided into grids each grid is further composed of a number of grouped response units grus kouwen et al 1993 the tile a specific gru within a given grid is the basic computational unit that aggregates different attributes such as soil and vegetation properties within the grid pietroniro and soulis 2003 the water storage energy and soil prognostic variables for each grid cell are weighted according to the grus percentage area that is occupied inside the grid kouwen et al 1993 the simulated terrestrial water storage in the mesh model is the sum of several prognostic variables including intercepted precipitation by the canopy rain or snow swe snowmelt held in the snow mass water ponded on the surface and liquid and frozen water content of soil layers lqws and frws note that in this study the vertical summation of lqws and frws prognostic states is called the subsurface storage state the number of soil layers is configurable in mesh as is their thicknesses a single layer snow model is used in mesh to simulate snow mass on bare soil verseghy 1991 verseghy et al 1993 evaluation of simulated swe of class in the snow model intercomparison project snowmip demonstrated that the single layer model performed as well as multilayer models brown et al 2006 3 methods 3 1 model configuration the mesh model for the liard has been set up at a 0 125 0 125 longitude latitude spatial resolution and half hourly temporal resolution this yielded a total of 2881 active grids for the basin with seven gru types including forest grass wetland barren land urban water and glaciers for the liard basin based on the ccmeo s dataset a set of seven meteorological inputs are required for the model incoming shortwave and longwave radiation precipitation temperature barometric pressure specific humidity and wind speed all input forcing expected precipitation was obtained from eccc s gem numerical weather prediction nwp model mctaggart cowan et al 2019a 2019b côté et al 1998a côté et al 1998b precipitation data were derived from the canadian precipitation analysis capa which is the analyzed interpolation product of precipitation observations with the model forecast field obtained from the gem model fortin et al 2018 lespinas et al 2015 mahfouf et al 2007 four soil layers with thicknesses of 0 1 0 25 0 75 and 3 0 m are used for this model yielding a total thickness of 4 1 m for the soil column model calibration was implemented using a pseudo multi objective approach that aggregated three streamflow error metrics including percentage bias pbias nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and nash sutcliffe efficiency with logarithmic transformation of streamflow nselog at the three selected streamflow stations nse emphasizes high flows while nselog captures low flows and pbias ensures that the total volume is preserved krause et al 2005 moriasi et al 2007 only influential parameters were calibrated as per haghnegahdar et al 2017 for the dominant grus forest grassland barren land and wetland a total of 49 soil vegetation and routing parameters were selected for calibration which was conducted using the dynamically dimensioned search dds method tolson and shoemaker 2007 calibration was performed over the october 2003 to october 2008 period while validation spanned the period october 2008 to october 2012 using a hydrological year that commences october 1st at 00 00 local time the model was spun up from october 2002 to october 2003 to eliminate the effect of initial conditions model performance was satisfactory for all stations with respective nse values of 0 73 and 0 78 at the basin outlet for calibration and validation periods while pbias changed from 8 calibration period to 5 validation october 2008 to october 2014 period was later used for open loop ol and da simulations 3 2 data assimilation the enks evensen and van leeuwen 2000 approach consists of two major components forecast or prediction and analysis or update steps evensen 2003 in the forecast step the model states are evolved forward in time as an ensemble to estimate errors in the analysis step observations are used to update model states for the time period of interest dunne and entekhabi 2005 in this application the beginning and end of the assimilation window correspond to the first and last day of the month a prognostic model refers to the mesh model in the enks the nonlinear model g propagates the analysis model states x k 1 i a sequentially from measurement time k 1 to the next measurement time step k using an ensemble of n random realizations of model errors q k i to derive the model forecast states x k i f as the following 1 x k i f g x k 1 i a q k i for i n in practice the model errors are prescribed by applying perturbations to model states and input climate forcing forman et al 2012 here for the sake of simplicity we dropped the ensemble index i in the enks method the analyzed states x k a are reinitialized as observations become available by a weighted linear combination of the model forecast x k f and the vector of measurement yk evensen 2003 this linear combination is written as 2 x k a x k f k k y k ε k h x k f where kk is the kalman gain and h is the measurement vector or operator to map the model states into measurement space following the work of forman and reichle 2013 and forman et al 2012 h was defined to convert model forecast states to the basin average estimates of tws the observations are perturbed by adding random realizations ε k of the measurement error burgers et al 1998 in this study the basin average of grace derived twsa observations is converted to absolute tws values by adding the corresponding time mean i e october 2008 to october 2014 tws estimates from the mesh simulation the second matrix in eq 2 i e k k y k ε k h x k f is called the analysis increments ai the analysis increments or updates transfer the vector of differences between the prediction and measurement to the model prognostic state at the model spatial resolution based upon the partitioning that is determined by kalman gain girotto et al 2019 the kalman gain kk represents the relative weights given to the model forecast states x k f and the observations yk during the update state kk is expressed as 3 k k p k f h t h p k f h t r 1 the model forecast background error covariance p k f is diagnosed from the sample covariance of the ensemble here r is the time invariant measurement covariance and t denotes the transpose operator in this study the observation errors are considered to be spatially uncorrelated thus only one scalar value for grace observations as a basin average is available for each month zaitchik et al 2008 following the work of forman et al 2012 a constant observation error variance of 289 mm2 is assigned for grace observations in the liard basin the sensitivity analysis for the choice of grace observation error is provided in section 6 2 2 3 2 1 perturbation setup in this study a perturbation module is included to the mesh modeling software we implemented a customized random field generator developed by the nasa global modeling and assimilation office gmao greenbelt md reichle et al 2009 the generation of ensemble spread is maintained by adding perturbations to meteorological forcing and model states reichle and koster 2003 based on the variable type log normally distributed multiplicative perturbations or normally distributed additive perturbations were generated reichle et al 2007 the precipitation shortwave radiation and swe are subjected to multiplicative perturbations longwave radiation received additive normal perturbations the overview of perturbation parameters is presented in table 1 following the work of reichle and koster 2003 and forman et al 2012 two dimensional pseudo random fields were generated with a horizontal decorrelation length of 2 latitude longitude the temporal correlation of the perturbations was applied through a first order autoregressive model ar 1 with a temporal decorrelation length of one day constraints on the perturbed field were applied for every step of the perturbation to avoid physically unfeasible conditions both types of multiplicative and additive perturbations were applied every 30 min at the 0 125 0 125 spatial resolution to yield an ensemble of ol perturbation fields were applied to precipitation radiation and swe while observations were not integrated with model estimates the ol ensembles were generated from october 2008 to october 2014 for comparison with data assimilation results following forman et al 2012 the major forcing inputs including precipitation and radiation were chosen to limit perturbation to these forcing fields the perturbation of the other model states rather than swe such as soil moisture in different layers can be added to the current perturbation structure because of the effect of creating biases between the ensemble mean and deterministic control no perturbation no assimilation as a result of the specifics of the mesh model or random fields perturbation of the model state swe was only considered 3 2 2 forecast and analysis approach based upon the work of zaitchik et al 2008 and forman et al 2012 the enks assimilation method was developed for the assimilation of grace data into the mesh model version 1 4 1037 the details of a two step proposed methodology are summarized in fig 2 the following paragraphs explain the method in greater detail in the first step of the ensemble based mesh grace data assimilation approach the mesh model is propagated for month k and the model prognostic states of day j at 00 00 utc x j k f are stored in memory as a variable xacc in this application the model state matrix x j k f has dimensions of m n where m is the total number of active water storage elements for n ensemble realizations in the liard basin m equals to the total numbers of mesh storage compartments multiplied by the total active tile members for each water storage compartment based upon the current set up of mesh in the liard basin m equals to 132 249 an ensemble size n of twenty members was used in the da framework as seen in the left hand panel of fig 2 forecast step the time dependent error covariance p k f and the kalman gain matrix kk are computed at the beginning of the month k based upon the model forecast states of the first day j 1 the model then continues running and stores tws states when the computing process reaches the end of the month the monthly forecast prediction of grace tws observations at the basin scale i e h x k f in eq 2 is computed in the second step analysis step of data assimilation the monthly averaged updates for month k are divided by the total number of days in the month to obtain the daily fraction of analysis increments aidaily in fig 2 the ensemble is reinitialized and the mesh model is reset to the beginning of the month during this step aidaily values are added to mesh forecast states x j k f over each day such that update model states x j k a are acquired analysis increments are applied to all tws compartments of the mesh model including swe the subsurface and other water storage states it is also possible to use prior information from the model to decide where to apply increments as part of a physically based update approach when the analysis increments are applied for the last day of the month the forecast step of the next month is launched this two step procedure is repeated for the next month and so on for months when grace observations are not available only the forecast step is activated 3 3 evaluation approach different types of evaluation skills were employed to evaluate simulated swe and streamflow estimates that were obtained from the mesh grace data assimilation framework spearman s rank correlations rs iman and conover 1979 pbias and the unbiased root mean square difference ubrmsd entekhabi et al 2010 were computed to compare mesh derived swe with independent cmc swe products and in situ swe observation data the rank order correlation between the ranks r i of modeled ensemble mean ol or da and the ranks s i of the evaluation product is defined as follows hamby 1994 4 r s i 1 t r i r s i s i 1 t r i r 2 i 1 t s i s 2 where r and s are time mean of the data set ranks and t is the total number of months r s ranges between 1 and 1 with the optimal value of 1 the statistical significance of the correlation differences was evaluated by using the fisher s z transformation the null hypothesis h0 with the 95 confidence interval was used to evaluate whether the computed rs differed from zero pbias indicates the tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than validation values gupta et al 1999 pbias was computed as 5 pbias i 1 t m i o i 100 i 1 t o i where mi is the modeled ensemble mean ol or da and oi are the validation data the optimal value of pbias is 0 0 with positive values indicating model overestimation and negative values indicating model underestimation bias similarly ubrmsd can be expressed as 6 ubrmsd 1 t i 1 t m i m o i o 2 where m and o are time means of modeled ensemble mean ol or da the ubrmsd values near zero indicate that model simulations approach the validation data the statistical significance of the ubrmsd differences between the ol and da simulations is determined using the student s t test with the 95 confidence interval the simulated streamflow of mesh was validated against streamflow observations that were taken at the three stations mentioned in section 2 by calculating pbias nse and nselog nse ranges between and 1 where the optimal value equals to 1 0 moriasi et al 2007 4 results 4 1 terrestrial water storage daily simulation results of mesh derived tws from the ol and da ensembles and the monthly grace tws retrievals for the liard basin are shown in fig 3 both ol and da simulations capture the seasonal cycle of tws month to month variation in tws is influenced by the integration of grace observations into the model consistent with expectation in most months a much better match is found between the da ensemble and grace observations than the ol one the assimilated tws ensemble mean lies between both the ol ensemble and grace observations which implies that conditioning of the model can effectively move estimates of the model toward the grace observations it is observed that in some cases namely year 2012 the number of updates after assimilation is small during winter and summer months in general the overall performance of the da procedure is quite promising it shows how grace observations despite their coarse resolution can improve estimates of total water storage and effectively influence the uncertainty of the model simulation 4 2 snow water equivalent 4 2 1 basin scale the influence of grace data assimilation on the simulation of swe was evaluated using monthly basin averaged cmc data fig 4 shows daily mesh derived swe estimates from the ol and grace da ensembles with their corresponding ensemble spreads monthly averaged cmc values of swe in the liard basin from october to june of each year have been added both ol and da ensembles match the observed seasonal cycle and interannual variability fig 4 in general the ol simulations overestimate swe compared to cmc monthly data the assimilation results show that integration of grace observations into mesh can effectively reduce the snow mass during winter seasons and consequently the ensemble averages move toward monthly cmc data another apparent feature is that the grace da reduces the uncertainty of the swe estimates compared to the ol as a result of data assimilation an average reduction of 10 mm in ensemble spread was attained daily estimates of mesh derived swe were converted to a monthly scale for comparison against the cmc data summary of the evaluation skills of pbias ubrmsd and rs are shown in fig 5 in terms of pbias grace da reduces bias of the simulation by 17 from 46 7 for ol to 29 6 for da the ubrmsd thus decreases from 22 6 mm for ol to 17 7 mm for da according to the t test realized t value 2 32 this improvement in ubrmsd is statistically significant yet evaluation results for rs show a very small improvement i e from 0 95 to 0 96 the statistical test that is based upon fisher s z transform with 95 confidence intervals indicates that the difference between ol and da correlations is not significant based upon pbias and ubrmsd assimilation of the grace data at the basin scale generally does not only improve the estimation of swe but also effectively reduces uncertainty of model estimates 4 2 2 grid scale in this section evaluation skills of the da in terms of correlations rs and ubrmsd are provided at a spatial resolution of 0 125 0 125 longitude latitude monthly cmc swe data were interpolated on the model grid using the nearest neighbor approach fig 6 a shows ubrmsd skill for the ol while fig 6 b presents the skill difference between da and ol simulations using blue and red colors to indicate locations of improvement and deterioration respectively significant improvements in ubrmsd are mainly achieved in the northern canadian rockies cassiar mountains and mackenzie mountains which are characterized by larger swe values compared to the rest of the basin grace da leads to degraded ubrmsd values at the northwestern and western boundaries of the liard basin the reason for degradation may be related to artifacts that are caused by the perturbation fields over these edge regions overall the ubrmsd values are improved for 85 of the grid cells covering the liard basin the largest improvement that was attained is 165 14 mm there are statistically significant improvements in terms of the ubrmsd metric in 56 of grid cells note that 4 of grid cells experience statistically significant degradations in swe estimates from the grace data assimilation maps of the correlations rs for the ol and their differences from the grace da are presented in fig 7 correlation differences fall with the range of 0 25 to 0 26 grid cells that are shown by black dots fig 7 b indicate that correlation differences between ol vs cmc and da vs cmc are statistically significant according to their associated 95 confidence intervals compared to the ol method grace da increased the correlation with cmc swe data for most grid cells covering the basin especially in the areas with large annual snow accumulations like the pattern of ubrmsd differences in fig 6 b a decrease in correlations is observed in a few grid cells that are located at the northwestern and western edges of the liard basin overall grace da improves the correlation skill values in 97 of the grid cells improvements are statistically significant different from zero in 61 of these cells degradation in the correlations is observed in less than 1 of the grid cells in the enks method the ensemble spread is regarded as the standard deviation around the ensemble mean evensen 2003 here the time mean of the monthly ensemble spreads from october 2008 to october 2014 was calculated for both ol and da methods fig 8 a presents the time mean ensemble spread of mesh derived swe for the ol experiment while fig 8 b maps the time mean ensemble spread of the grace da minus the ol method for swe the mean ensemble spread for the ol over all grid cells in the liard basin equals 25 2 mm larger ensemble spreads are found in the mountainous areas of the basin especially in the northern canadian rockies and mackenzie mountains which are dominated by significant seasonal snowpack accumulations smaller ensemble spreads are obtained in the grid cells covering non mountainous areas including the southeastern and eastern parts of the liard basin after assimilating grace observations into the mesh model the spatially averaged reduction in ensemble spread equals 14 4 mm with the exception of one grid cell the ensemble spreads of grace da are smaller than those obtained by the ol method the larger reductions in the uncertainty of swe estimates dark blue in fig 8 b mainly occur in areas where the ol produced large ensemble spreads dark brown in fig 8 a in summary constraining model forecasts by implementing grace da effectively reduced the uncertainty in the mesh derived swe larger reductions in the ensemble spreads are mainly achieved in areas where significant reductions in the ubrmsd actual error values are observed 4 2 3 comparison with snow measurements this study uses mainly cmc swe as a reference product for the comparisons however to further assess the assimilation results the ol and da swe simulations were compared against independent ground based monthly snow survey observations from the three stations available section 2 4 because of the data limitations of the automatic stations over the study period the evaluation could be conducted during only two snow seasons 2013 and 2014 to perform each comparison mesh swe simulations had to be matched in space and time with snow survey observations then evaluation metrics were computed across time the results are presented in table 2 fig 9 shows a time series of the ol and grace da ensemble means along with snow survey observations and cmc swe during the onset of snow the ol da in situ observations and cmc swe estimates agree quite well especially from november to january as small updates were applied to mesh model estimates from february to april when much snow masses were reduced from model simulations differences between swe estimates were observed in terms of pbias skill the grace da reduces the bias in the swe at 4c22p 29 6 for ol 15 8 for da and 4c20p 18 2 for ol 1 7 for da however the absolute value of pbias was increased at the station 4c21p from 2 for ol to 14 1 for da the evaluation results for the ubrmsd skill shows that grace da leads to slight degradations at two snow survey sites compared to ol the correlation skill values were slightly reduced as a result of the assimilation for all three sites however the degradation of da skills for both ubrmsd and rs were not statistically significant at the 95 confidence level relative to the ol simulations in general the effect of grace da on swe estimates at the three snow survey stations was found to be mixed with some patterns of improvements and degradations observed in the intercomparisons to the open loop simulations overall with grace da the metrics obtained with cmc in the grid cell corresponding to each ground based station are not different from those computed for the stations table 2 the pbias improvement follows roughly the same trends the ubrmsd values vary in a tight range between 16 and 25 mm in all cases and the correlations found are quite similar however the comparison here is just indicative and should be considered with caution due to representativeness error as stations only provide point measurements while cmc swe is gridded 4 3 streamflow the performance of ol and grace da in terms of streamflow was evaluated using pbias nse and nselog fig 10 presents daily mesh derived streamflow estimates from the ol and grace da ensembles with the corresponding ensemble spreads daily averages of the streamflow observations over six years from the three selected river stations were compared against the ol and da approaches evaluations are presented in table 3 in terms of pbias skill the grace da reduces the bias in the streamflow at fort liard from 8 5 for ol to 4 7 for da however the bias skills became slightly worse at the stations near the mouth 3 1 for ol 9 1 for da and lower crossing 4 8 for ol 9 7 for da changes in the sign of the bias values from negative to positive are related to the reduction of total flow volumes as a result of decreasing snow accumulation evaluation results for the nse skill show that grace da improves high flow peaks during snowmelt seasons from april to june at both fort liard nse 0 79 for ol nse 0 83 for da and lower crossing nse 0 74 for ol nse 0 86 for da for example da adjusted the streamflow discharge peaks at fort liard station by 2000 m3 s 1 in june 2014 the nse skill remains unchanged for the mouth station both ol and da have negative biases in low flow simulations relative to streamflow observations fig 10 the assimilation of tws retrievals has little effect on the low flow estimates during winter seasons the evaluation results for the nselog skill reveal that very small degradations in low flows occurred at lower crossing during simulation of the da compared to ol the time mean of daily ensemble spreads from october 2008 to october 2014 of river stations was calculated for both ol and da methods results show that reductions of ensemble spreads that were caused by grace da equal 300 2 m3 s 1 for near the mouth 241 6 m3 s 1 for fort liard and 168 0 m3 s 1 for lower crossing in general ol does an acceptable job of estimating streamflow such that a high degree of concordance is achieved between ol simulations and observations the effect of the grace da on the simulations of streamflow is encouraging grace da can correct high peaks so that the general evolution of estimated streamflow corresponds to the gauge observations fairly well the assimilation results show that when the assimilation framework activated the da ensemble mean moves closer to the daily observed streamflow observations relative to the ol simulations the simulation of high flow results using the nse metric at the fort liard and lower crossing stations indicates the effects of grace assimilation on streamflow simulation like the results of modeled swe the assimilation effectively reduces ensemble spread for all stations especially at peak flow times 5 discussion 5 1 evaluation of the results the comparison of the ol and da tws results versus grace derived tws retrievals demonstrates that the enks method can constrain the amplitude of modeled tws dynamics so that close agreement with grace observations is obtained in some cases the lack of updates is observed two possible reasons may cause this small difference first the difference is not large between the model predicted tws and the grace tws observations second the uncertainty of predicted water storage is small relative to the uncertainty of the observations as the uncertainties of different soil layers are not included during this experiment we would expect to observe a small number of updates during summer months when the uncertainty of model estimates are relatively small in comparison to grace observations a near zero covariance structure is produced forman et al 2012 snow simulation results that were obtained in this study are consistent with forman et al 2012 and su et al 2010 who demonstrated that swe estimates could be improved in comparison to the cmc swe data across portions of north america the assimilation of grace observations into the mesh model shows that swe estimates in terms of ubrmsd and spearman s rank correlations that were estimated at the basin and grid scales have been improved the mesh grace da framework generally improved the estimation of swe in the liard basin the gridded results showed areas in which the greatest improvements in terms of temporal correlation and ubrmsd were achieved the gridded scale results reveal that how the data assimilation procedure can effectively transfer information from the coarse scale 150 000 km2 grace tws retrievals to the finer scale 100 km2 model resolution degradation in the estimation of swe was observed in some grid cells as a result of grace assimilation relative to the ol results figs 6 and 7 loss of skills can be explained by some possible factors first the gridded grace observations were processed by averaging up to the liard basin scale assuming spatially uncorrelated errors to make them compatible for integration with the mesh model however it is worth pointing out when the gridded grace observations are used instead of the basin averaged tws values it is recommended to consider the errors of observations to be spatially correlated schumacher et al 2018 2016 forman and reichle 2013 and eicker et al 2014 found that data assimilation of grace tws retrievals performs optimally when observations are assimilated at the smallest spatial scale i e 5 5 such that the observation errors become uncorrelated girotto et al 2016 by considering the optimal spatial scale of grace data for the da the smallest spatial scale in the liard basin at which grace observation can be reasonably resolved is about 150 000 km2 therefore the use of 1 1 gridded grace observations might not change the results since the basin size 275 000 km2 is not substantially larger than the true resolution of observations kumar et al 2016 assimilated both 1 1 gridded and basin averaged grace twsa products into nasa s catchment land surface model clsm over the continental united states conus they obtained small differences between the da of basin averaged and gridded results second in some grid cells where degradations of ubrmsd were observed ol does a reasonable job in estimating swe it is apparent that during the update step the quantity of reduced mass was larger than what was required to be subtracted from the mesh simulations therefore the ubrmsd values were degraded as a result of grace assimilation relative to the ol results third in some grid cells the correlations between ol simulation results and cmc swe were not strong compared to the da results fig 7 correlation values obtained with ol in those areas range between 0 5 and 0 7 this may be explained by the pronounced slope effects on snow accumulation in the grid concerned which are mainly concentrated in the transition zones between the high elevation areas and the lowlands see fig 1 also the lower magnitude of swe in some grid cells in the eastern part may affect the results forth even though the cmc swe product is often considered as a very reliable source for the evaluation of modeled swe it suffers from some limitations including imperfect accumulation and melt model and coarse atmospheric forcing together with the scarcity of in situ snow depth measurements in northern latitudes 55 n brown and brasnett 2010 brown et al 2010 swenson and lawrence 2012 toure et al 2016 over northern latitudes and data sparse areas cmc swe analysis depends mostly on the gem precipitation rather than snow observations in addition snow depth observations tend to be biased to coastal locations or large open areas at airports brown and brasnett 2010 therefore in areas experiencing lack of in situ station data the evaluation of mesh swe estimates based on the cmc swe analysis data becomes likely a model intercomparison rather than a validation with a reference of known uncertainty a number of distinct remarks could be made from the snow survey evaluation first da simulations at the three stations experienced negative biases in march and april 2013 relative to snow observations this could be explained partly by the fact that grace observation was not available in march 2013 thus the analysis or update in the assimilation procedure in march was not performed second in 2013 mesh simulations ol and da showed maximum swe in march while snow observation indicated the maximum values in april a temporal lag of around 15 days was observed between model simulations and snow observations third the data assimilation method performed effectively in the snow season of 2014 such that a close agreement between mesh swe estimates and snow observations was witnessed forth the variations of cmc swe compared to in situ observations show a varying level of agreement based on the year and snowmelt occurrence periods fig 9 this affects the statistics presented in table 2 when the onset period of the snow accumulation is considered november to january the agreement improved significantly for example the ubrmsd found when comparing ol and da to the snow survey stations vary from 6 6 mm to 10 9 mm for ol and from 6 2 mm to 9 7 mm for da a similar improvement was found when ol and da are compared to cmc swe in the grid cells corresponding to station locations 6 2 mm to 9 8 mm for ol and from 4 7 mm to 9 2 mm for da better correlations were also obtained during the onset period 0 94 compared to the whole season table 2 the lack of data during the snowmelt period did not allow any particular analysis for that specific period overall since the number of observations is limited the findings here should be considered with caution even if very encouraging results could be seen during the onset period it is not possible to draw a clear conclusion on whether grace da improves swe estimates compared to the ol simulations at this stage of the study it is also worth to notice that comparing point level measurements from automatic stations to gridded values from mesh or cmc may introduce uncertainties due to swe spatial heterogeneity the limited number of stations used and the short period 2 years do not allow robust conclusions to be drawn however the results shown in fig 9 and table 2 comfort us in the use of cmc as a reference swe product in this study since there is no ideal reliable source of swe data available the assimilation results in the streamflow simulations show that the effect of integrating grace observations is small compared to the effects on modeled tws and swe estimates yet the developed framework can improve high flows especially near the peak summer of rainfall seasons note that fluxes are indirectly updated in the grace da framework they are subsequently modified as a result of the state vector update forman and reichle 2013 schumacher et al 2018 therefore one cannot ignore the influence of grace tws retrievals on streamflow simulations estimates of streamflow for flow volume and low flow were slightly degraded at some stations as a result of grace assimilation the degradation of the streamflow estimate in the liard basin using nasa s clsm model has been reported by forman and reichle 2013 and by forman et al 2012 the loss of skill that is noted in table 3 can be related to different possible reasons first swe is reduced by da in the liard basin which means less swe is available to produce snowmelt streamflow second adding subsurface water in the form of surface and root zone soil moisture during warm seasons leads to more runoff yet water storage increments that were added during the analysis step of assimilation during summer are not sufficient to compensate for deficiencies of the model to simulate adequate streamflow third both ol and da experience negative biases during the winter seasons december to april for the simulation of low flows fig 10 this is particularly obvious during winter when the overland and inter flow components are near zero and the base flow component is the major contributor to winter runoff forman et al 2012 this negative bias may be related to limitations of the mesh model in generating sufficient base flow at three observed stations 5 2 assimilation diagnostics 5 2 1 ensemble spread the ensemble spread is a measure of the uncertainty of the model estimates girotto et al 2019 assimilation results at the basin and gridded scales revealed that observations can substantially reduce uncertainty of the model between the ol and da simulations the results presented here are consistent with the work of forman et al 2012 who demonstrated that grace da is valuable for reducing ensemble spread for the estimation of swe in this study large values of swe ensemble spreads for the ol simulations were encountered in mountainous areas northern canadian rockies cassiar mountains and mackenzie mountains in these areas the actual errors i e the ubrmsd are also large compared to the other regions the large uncertainty that is associated with complex terrain may be related to capa precipitation forcing and the relatively coarse horizontal resolution of the mesh model 10 km lespinas et al 2015 asserted that current limitations of capa can result from different factors including 1 the scarcity of reliable observations in canada 2 problems with observation errors associated with solid precipitation 3 the presence of biases in gem precipitation fields 4 biases that result from data transformation and 5 verification methodology carrera et al 2010 demonstrated that reliable estimation of swe over the canadian rockies can be acquired by increasing the horizontal resolution of climate forcing especially the capa analysis product in complex terrain precipitation and snow accumulation experience high spatial variability due to cloud microphysics and particle transport processes schirmer and jamieson 2015 furthermore in the current liard model set up blowing snow was not considered however this option is available in the mesh configuration blowing snow re distribution can be also an important process that influences accurate snow accumulation macdonald et al 2009 note that the reduction of uncertainty in the model estimates does not necessarily mean that better estimates are achieved when compared to the validation data girotto et al 2019 for example in the region near the northwestern and western boundaries of the basin ensemble spreads were reduced however the ubrmsd values are degraded as a result of the grace assimilation 5 2 2 normalized innovation sequence a filter innovation for a given month k is defined as the difference between the ensemble mean observation and model forecast i e y k h x k f the statistics of the filter innovations is a useful tool to indicate whether or not the choice of the model table 1 and measurement error parameters is appropriate reichle and koster 2002 in a linear system with mutually and serially uncorrelated gaussian model perturbations and observation errors the normalized innovations ni should follow a standard normal distribution zero mean unit variance and temporally uncorrelated kumar et al 2008 even though the filter used here is a smoother rather than a filter and the mesh model is nonlinear deviations of the ni statistics from the theoretical ideals can be used to diagnose useful information as the performance of the da procedure forman et al 2012 the normalized innovation is written as 7 ni k y k h x k f h p k f h t r where the covariance of innovation i e h p k f h t r is based on the combination of the background and measurement error and can be used to normalize the innovations reichle and koster 2002 then the statistics mean and standard deviation of ni are collected as a function of time to assess the performance based on the innovation we did a sensitivity analysis by conducting the data assimilation experiments with a range of different values of grace measurement variance r in eq 7 thus four measurement variance values 72 25 289 650 25 1156 mm2 were chosen following the work of forman et al 2012 and other studies who adopted some of the same values kumar et al 2016 su et al 2010 zaitchik et al 2008 the results of the mean and standard deviation of normalized innovations are shown in fig 11 it is observed that the mean values ni of the normalized innovations using r values of 289 mm2 and 650 25 mm2 equal to zero this implies that the data assimilation simulations are unbiased for these two experiments the noticeable feature is that the mean innovations using two observation errors of 72 25 mm2 and 1156 mm2 have positive and negative biases it is important to note that with increasing observation error variances the variance of innovations σni decreases this reduction is expected as an increase in measurement error causes an increase in the dominator of eq 7 which leads to a reduction in the standard deviation of the normalized innovation based on the information provided by the normalized innovations the selection of the observation error between 289 mm2 and 650 25 mm2 indicates a reasonable data assimilation performance for the mesh model i e a σni close to unity and a ni close to zero these findings are consistent with previous data assimilation studies that considered observation variance between 289 mm2 and 400 mm2 forman et al 2012 forman and reichle 2013 kumar et al 2016 su et al 2010 zaitchik et al 2008 5 2 3 analysis increments examination of analysis increment i e the difference between update and forecast can provide another way of realizing the behavior of the data assimilation system forman et al 2012 it shows how much and at what time information from grace observations in the data assimilation framework affect the estimation of water storage at different vertical layers forman et al 2012 girotto et al 2019 fig 12 shows the monthly basin averaged time series for six years of ensemble average increments of swe and subsurface water storage the negative and positive signs of the increment indicate how the assimilation subtracts and adds water storage in certain months such as march 2013 when the grace observations were not available the increments were all zeros the increments that were applied to swe and subsurface storage are shown with solid blue and black lines respectively analysis increments were applied to all water storage compartments of the mesh model the updates of the other components were not significant when compared to swe and subsurface storage the summation of swe increments for six years equals 127 1 mm assimilation reduces snow mass from the mesh estimates during the snow accumulation seasons from november to may of each year fig 12 a small amount of swe is added back during the spring ablation and snowmelt phases the summation of the subsurface increments over space and time equals 17 90 mm small or near zero numbers of subsurface updates are possibly related to the perturbation structure such that the uncertainties of soil water compartments were not included in the system the pattern rather than the magnitude of increments especially swe was consistent to some extent with those reported by forman et al 2012 who assimilated grace observations into the clsm model in the mackenzie basin together these results verify that grace da has an effect on reducing snow mass during snow accumulation seasons but then increases the mass slightly during warm periods this behavior indicates that grace data contain valuable information that helps to constrain the individual model compartments of the mesh model 6 conclusion this study examined the incorporation and development of the ensemble based mesh grace data assimilation framework into the eccc community environmental modeling for the first time the enks assimilation method in the liard basin was used to integrate grace derived tws data into the mesh model for swe estimates when compared against the cmc swe data data assimilation at the basin scale reduced the bias of the open loop simulation significantly from 46 7 to 29 6 and improved the unbiased rmsd by 23 this confirms that grace tws assimilation has an effect on reducing snow mass during snow accumulation data assimilation also reduced significantly the ensemble spreads in terms of correlations a negligible improvement was observed 0 95 for ol 0 96 for da at the gridded scale the da process showed larger improvements in the ubrmsd compared to the ol mainly in areas with substantial annual snow accumulation particularly in the northern canadian rockies overall the ubrmsd values were improved in 85 of the grid cells in 56 of grid cells the ubrmsd improvements were statistically significant the da method improved the correlations with cmc swe in 97 of the grid cells in 61 of these grid cells the correlation differences between the ol and da differed statistically from zero the grace da approach reduced the ensemble spreads in almost all of the gridded cells the evaluation of the results based on in situ observations from november to april presented a varying level of concordance with better agreements during the snow onset period november to january due to insufficient snow observations during the snowmelt periods the evaluation of the results could not be properly conducted overall more validation data are still needed to better assess the contributions of da compared to ol the impact of grace data assimilation on streamflow simulations was evaluated against observations from three river gauges grace da could effectively improve the simulation of high flows at lower crossing ns 0 74 for ol ns 0 86 for da and fort liard ns 0 76 for ol ns 0 83 for da while it remained unchanged ns 0 76 for the mouth station the influence of grace da on total flow volume and low flows was found to be variable the assimilation procedure can effectively reduce the ensemble spreads in the streamflow simulations especially during peak flow times the assimilation of grace tws retrievals in the liard basin provides some valuable insights for ongoing scientific applications further works will extend the research to different basins with variable climate regimes and swe conditions the use of gridded observations at a finer spatial resolution 1 1 will be investigated by considering the full error covariance of the observations the findings of this research have important implications for evaluating the performance of the mesh grace data assimilation framework for the purpose of improving regional estimates of swe and streamflow these results motivate future efforts to understand the influence of grace data assimilation on the interannual seasonality and sub seasonal variability of swe at basin averaged and gridded scales and investigate whether grace da leads to changes in the timing of snow accumulation ablation phases moreover the possibility of extending the developed methodology to multisource data assimilation could be explored to further improve the accuracy of model estimates credit authorship contribution statement ala bahrami

4663,accurate estimation of snow mass or snow water equivalent swe over space and time is required for global and regional predictions of the effects of climate change this work investigates whether integration of remotely sensed terrestrial water storage tws information which is derived from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace can improve swe and streamflow simulations within a semi distributed hydrology land surface model a data assimilation da framework was developed to combine tws observations with the mesh modélisation environnementale communautaire surface hydrology

respectively effects of grace da on streamflow simulations were evaluated against observations from three river gauges where it effectively improved the simulation of high flows during snowmelt season from april to june the influence of grace da on the total flow volume and low flows was found to be variable in general the use of grace observations in the assimilation framework not only improved the simulation of swe but also effectively influenced streamflow simulations keywords grace mesh data assimilation enks snow water equivalent terrestrial water storage 1 introduction snow is an important component of terrestrial water storage tws with considerable influence on the short and long term behaviors of climate systems cohen and entekhabi 1999 su et al 2010 walsh 1984 in northern

critical to hydrologists and water resource managers for operational run off and river discharge forecasts mccreight et al 2014 pulliainen 2006 therefore it is vital that snowpack characteristics are

that is no better than a few hundred kilometers 300 km at midlatitudes landerer and swenson 2012 unlike other satellite based instruments such as passive microwave sensors grace does not rely upon soil surface and vegetation conditions behrangi et al 2017 2018 over snow dominated areas the total water storage changes that are captured by grace are strongly influenced by snow mass changes during

the validation of results against snow survey observations has indicated that mesh underestimates the swe estimates pietroniro et al 2007 the major sources of errors in the mesh model simulations are related to the quality of input forcing data model physical parameterization and land surface characteristics data bearing in mind these limitations of the model improvements to the performance of mesh are required for the simulation of water storage components the data assimilation da technique can incorporate remote sensing observations into hydrological models in da methods hydrological predictions are improved by combining model estimates with observations davison et al 2019 based upon the level of uncertainties that are accounted for in both model predictions and observations dunne

the great lakes by incorporating smos soil moisture retrievals into the mesh model results highlighted that the developed da methodology can improve moisture estimation for both the soil surface and root zone over the crop dominated grids as development of the mesh model continues some researchers and collaborators have focused upon incorporating remotely sensed products into the modeling system especially for forecasting applications xu et al 2015 yassin et al 2017 given the importance of grace observations in improving changes in estimated terrestrial water storage and its compartments in different lsms a question arises whether integrating grace observations into the mesh is truly effective given the coarse spatial and temporal resolutions of grace observations a robust data assimilation method should be implemented to improve mesh model predictions the first specific objective evaluated how the assimilation of basin averaged grace observations could improve mesh model predictions of swe at both basin and gridded spatial resolution scales our second specific objective examined the influence of the developed assimilation framework on streamflow simulation to achieve these objectives the ensemble kalman smoother enks evensen and van leeuwen 2000 framework was implemented in the snow dominated liard basin of northwestern canada validation of results was conducted

mackenzie river basin fig 1 the watershed of the liard river drains portions of british columbia and alberta and the yukon and northwest territories of boreal northwestern canada spanning longitudes 132 w to 118 w and latitudes 57 n to 63 n land cover of the liard basin is dominated by sub polar needleleaf and mixed forest 71 and grasslands 16 followed by barren land 7 and wetlands 4 a small fraction of its area is covered by water bodies 1 5 and glaciers 0 5 the basin is about 275 000 km2 in area which is greater than the effective area of 150 000 km2 that can be resolved by grace at mid and high latitudes forman et al 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 two main reasons motivated selection of the liard basin as the case study first preliminary analyses not presented in this study revealed that grace twsa seasonal amplitudes in the liard basin are dominated by snow mass changes during the snow season bahrami et al 2020 second contributions of surface water mass changes from lakes reservoirs and river storage to total water storage is not significant given the very low surface coverage contributions of water bodies and wetlands in the basin 2 2 grace tws datasets the gridded 1

data products that were provided by three data centers including the center for space research csr of the university of texas at austin the deutsches geoforschungszentrum gfz the german research centre for geosciences potsdam germany and jpl pasadena ca usa to effectively reduce the noise in the grace data we used the arithmetic mean of all three data products sakumura et al 2014 because of filtering and truncation of grace twsa observations the surface mass variation signal is attenuated swenson and wahr 2006 gridded 1 1 multiplicative gain factors that are provided by tellus were applied to the original grace tws retrievals to restore the signal loss landerer and swenson 2012 the linear trends that were related to glacial isostatic adjustment gia have been removed from grace

imperfect model accumulation and melt model and coarse atmospheric forcing together with a paucity of snow stations at higher latitudes swenson and lawrence 2012 toure et al 2016 in northern latitudes

pietroniro et al 2007 the current version of the mesh model contains an integrated lsm and a river routing system the geophysical heterogeneity within each grid cell can be defined based upon a digital elevation model dem land cover classification and soil characteristics davison et al 2019 the topographic data are based upon the canadian digital elevation data cded 2016 at a scale of 1 50

canada centre for remote sensing ccrs soil texture information comes from soil landscapes of canada slc 2010 data of agriculture and agri food canada in the mesh model the desired basin is divided into grids each grid is further composed of a number of grouped response units grus kouwen et al 1993 the tile a specific gru within a given grid is the basic computational unit that aggregates different attributes such as soil and vegetation properties within the grid pietroniro and soulis 2003 the water storage energy and soil prognostic variables for each grid cell are weighted according to the grus percentage area that is occupied inside the grid kouwen et al 1993 the simulated terrestrial water storage in the mesh model is the sum of several prognostic variables including intercepted precipitation by the canopy rain or snow swe snowmelt held in the snow mass water ponded on the surface and liquid and frozen water content of soil layers lqws and frws note that in this study the vertical summation of lqws and frws prognostic states is called the subsurface storage state the number of soil layers is configurable in mesh as is their thicknesses a single layer snow

from the gem model fortin et al 2018 lespinas et al 2015 mahfouf et al 2007 four soil layers with thicknesses of 0 1 0 25 0 75 and 3 0 m are used for this model yielding a total thickness of 4 1 m for the soil column model calibration was implemented using a pseudo multi objective approach that aggregated three streamflow error metrics including percentage bias pbias nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and nash sutcliffe efficiency with logarithmic transformation of streamflow nselog at the three selected streamflow stations nse emphasizes high flows while nselog captures low flows and pbias ensures that the total volume is preserved krause et al 2005 moriasi et al 2007 only influential parameters were calibrated as per haghnegahdar et al 2017 for the dominant grus forest grassland barren land and wetland a total of 49 soil vegetation and routing parameters were selected for calibration which was conducted using the dynamically dimensioned search dds method tolson and shoemaker 2007 calibration was performed over the october 2003 to october 2008 period while validation spanned the period october 2008 to october 2012 using a hydrological year that commences october 1st at 00 00 local time the model was spun up from october 2002 to october 2003 to eliminate the effect of initial conditions model performance was satisfactory for all stations with respective nse values of 0 73 and 0 78 at the basin outlet for calibration and validation periods while pbias changed from 8 calibration period to 5 validation october 2008 to october 2014 period was later used for open loop ol and da simulations 3 2 data assimilation the enks evensen and van leeuwen 2000 approach consists of two major components forecast or prediction and analysis or update steps evensen 2003 in the forecast step the model states are evolved forward in time as an ensemble to estimate errors in the analysis step observations are used to update model states for the time period of interest dunne and entekhabi 2005 in this application the beginning and end of the assimilation window correspond to the first and last day of the month a prognostic model refers to the mesh model in the enks the nonlinear model g propagates the analysis model states x k 1 i a sequentially from measurement time k 1 to the next measurement time step k using an ensemble of n random realizations of model errors q k i to derive the model forecast states x k i f as the following 1 x k i f g x k 1 i a q k i for i n in practice the model errors are prescribed by applying perturbations to model states and input climate forcing forman et al 2012 here for the sake of simplicity we dropped the ensemble index i in the enks method the analyzed states x k a are reinitialized as observations become available by a weighted linear combination of the model forecast x k f and the vector of measurement yk evensen 2003 this linear combination is written as 2 x k a x k f k k y k ε k h x k f where kk is the kalman gain and h is the measurement vector or operator to map the model states into measurement space following the work of forman and reichle 2013 and forman et al 2012 h was defined to convert model forecast states to the basin average estimates of tws the observations are perturbed by adding random realizations ε k of the measurement error burgers et al 1998 in this study the basin average of grace derived twsa observations is converted to absolute tws values by adding the corresponding time mean i e october 2008 to october 2014 tws estimates from the mesh simulation the second matrix in eq 2 i e k k y k ε k h x k f is called the analysis increments ai the analysis increments or updates transfer the vector of differences between the prediction and measurement to the model prognostic state at the model spatial resolution based upon the partitioning that is determined by kalman gain girotto et al 2019 the kalman gain kk represents the relative weights given to the model forecast states x k f and the observations yk during the update state kk is expressed as 3 k k p k f h t h p k f h t r 1 the model forecast background error covariance p k f is diagnosed from the sample covariance of the ensemble here r is the time invariant measurement covariance and t denotes the transpose operator in this study the observation errors are considered to be spatially uncorrelated thus only one scalar value for grace observations as a basin average is available for each month zaitchik et al 2008 following the work of forman et al 2012 a constant observation error variance of 289 mm2 is assigned for grace observations in the liard basin the sensitivity analysis for the choice of grace observation error is provided in section 6 2 2 3 2 1 perturbation setup in this study a perturbation module is included to the mesh modeling software we implemented a customized random field generator developed by the nasa global modeling and assimilation office gmao greenbelt md reichle et al 2009 the generation of ensemble spread is maintained by adding perturbations to meteorological forcing and model states reichle and koster 2003 based on the variable type log normally distributed multiplicative perturbations or normally distributed additive perturbations were generated reichle et al 2007 the precipitation shortwave radiation and swe are subjected to multiplicative perturbations longwave radiation received additive normal perturbations the overview of perturbation parameters is presented in table 1 following the work of reichle and koster 2003 and forman et al 2012 two dimensional pseudo random fields were generated with a horizontal decorrelation length of 2 latitude longitude the temporal correlation of the perturbations was applied through a first order autoregressive model ar 1 with a temporal decorrelation length of one day constraints on the perturbed field were applied for every step of the perturbation to avoid physically unfeasible conditions both types of multiplicative and additive perturbations were applied every 30 min at the 0 125 0 125 spatial resolution to yield an ensemble of ol perturbation fields were applied to precipitation radiation and swe while observations were not integrated with model estimates the ol ensembles were generated from october 2008 to october 2014 for comparison with data assimilation results following forman et al 2012 the major forcing inputs including precipitation and radiation were chosen to limit perturbation to these forcing fields the perturbation of the other model states rather than swe such as soil moisture in different layers can be added to the current perturbation structure because of the effect of creating biases between the ensemble mean and deterministic control no perturbation no assimilation as a result of the specifics of the mesh model or random fields perturbation of the model state swe was only considered 3 2 2 forecast and analysis approach based upon the work of zaitchik et al 2008 and forman et al 2012 the enks assimilation method was developed for the assimilation of grace data into the mesh model version 1 4 1037 the details of a two step proposed methodology are summarized in fig 2 the following paragraphs explain the method in greater detail in the first step of the ensemble based mesh grace data assimilation approach the mesh model is propagated for month k and the model prognostic states of day j at 00 00 utc x j k f are stored in memory as a variable xacc in this application the model state matrix x j k f has dimensions of m n where m is the total number of active water storage elements for n ensemble realizations in the liard basin m equals to the total numbers of mesh storage compartments multiplied by the total active tile members for each water storage compartment based upon the current set up of mesh in the liard basin m equals to 132 249 an ensemble size n of twenty members was used in the da framework as seen in the left hand panel of fig 2 forecast step the time dependent error covariance p k f and the kalman gain matrix kk are computed at the beginning of the month k based upon the model forecast states of the first day j 1 the model then continues running and stores tws states when the computing process reaches the end of the month the monthly forecast prediction of grace tws observations at the basin scale i e h x k f in eq 2 is computed in the second step analysis step of data assimilation the monthly averaged updates for month k are divided by the total number of days in the month to obtain the daily fraction of analysis increments aidaily in fig 2 the ensemble is reinitialized and the mesh model is reset to the beginning of the month during this step aidaily values are added to mesh forecast states x j k f over each day such that update model states x j k a are acquired analysis increments are applied to all tws compartments of the mesh model including swe the subsurface and other water storage states it is also possible to use prior information from the model to decide where to apply increments as part of a physically based update approach when the analysis increments are applied for the last day of the month the forecast step of the next month is launched this two step procedure is repeated for the next month and so on for months when grace observations are not available only the forecast step is activated 3 3 evaluation approach different types of evaluation skills were employed to evaluate simulated swe and streamflow estimates that were obtained from the mesh grace data assimilation framework spearman s rank correlations rs iman and conover 1979 pbias and the unbiased root mean square difference ubrmsd entekhabi et al 2010 were computed to compare mesh derived swe with independent cmc swe products and in situ swe observation data the rank order correlation between the ranks r i of modeled ensemble mean ol or da and the ranks s i of the evaluation product is defined as follows hamby 1994 4 r s i 1 t r i r s i s i 1 t r i r 2 i 1 t s i s 2 where r and s are time mean of the data set ranks and t is the total number of months r s ranges between 1 and 1 with the optimal value of 1 the statistical significance of the correlation differences was evaluated by using the fisher s z transformation the null hypothesis h0 with the 95 confidence interval was used to evaluate whether the computed rs differed from zero pbias indicates the tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than validation values gupta et al 1999 pbias was computed as 5 pbias i 1 t m i o i 100 i 1 t o i where mi is the modeled ensemble mean ol or da and oi are the validation data the optimal value of pbias is 0 0 with positive values indicating model overestimation and negative values indicating model underestimation bias similarly ubrmsd can be expressed as 6 ubrmsd 1 t i 1 t m i m o i o 2 where m and o are time means of modeled ensemble mean ol or da the ubrmsd values near zero indicate that model simulations approach the validation data the statistical significance of the ubrmsd differences between the ol and da simulations is determined using the student s t test with the 95 confidence interval the simulated streamflow of mesh was validated against streamflow observations that were taken at the three stations mentioned in section 2 by calculating pbias nse and nselog nse ranges between and 1 where the optimal value equals to 1 0 moriasi et al 2007 4 results 4 1 terrestrial water storage daily simulation results of mesh derived tws from the ol and da ensembles and the monthly grace tws retrievals for the liard basin are shown in fig 3 both ol and da simulations capture the seasonal cycle of tws month to month variation in tws is influenced by the integration of grace observations into the model consistent with expectation in most months a much better match is found between the da ensemble and grace observations than the ol one the assimilated tws ensemble mean lies between both the ol ensemble and grace observations which implies that conditioning of the model can effectively move estimates of the model toward the grace observations it is observed that in some cases namely year 2012 the number of updates after assimilation is small during winter and summer months in general the overall performance of the da procedure is quite promising it shows how grace observations despite their coarse resolution can improve estimates of total water storage and effectively influence the uncertainty of the model simulation 4 2 snow water equivalent 4 2 1 basin scale the influence of grace data assimilation on the simulation of swe was evaluated using monthly basin averaged cmc data fig 4 shows daily mesh derived swe estimates from the ol and grace da ensembles with their corresponding ensemble spreads monthly averaged cmc values of swe in the liard basin from october to june of each year have been added both ol and da ensembles match the observed seasonal cycle and interannual variability fig 4 in general the ol simulations overestimate swe compared to cmc monthly data the assimilation results show that integration of grace observations into mesh can effectively reduce the snow mass during winter seasons and consequently the ensemble averages move toward monthly cmc data another apparent feature is that the grace da reduces the uncertainty of the swe estimates compared to the ol as a result of data assimilation an average reduction of 10 mm in ensemble spread was attained daily estimates of mesh derived swe were converted to a monthly scale for comparison against the cmc data summary of the evaluation skills of pbias ubrmsd and rs are shown in fig 5 in terms of pbias grace da reduces bias of the simulation by 17 from 46 7 for ol to 29 6 for da the ubrmsd thus decreases from 22 6 mm for ol to 17 7 mm for da according to the t test realized t value 2 32 this improvement in ubrmsd is statistically significant yet evaluation results for rs show a very small improvement i e from 0 95 to 0 96 the statistical test that is based upon fisher s z transform with 95 confidence intervals indicates that the difference between ol and da correlations is not significant based upon pbias and ubrmsd assimilation of the grace data at the basin scale generally does not only improve the estimation of swe but also effectively reduces uncertainty of model estimates 4 2 2 grid scale in this section evaluation skills of the da in terms of correlations rs and ubrmsd are provided at a spatial resolution of 0 125 0 125 longitude latitude monthly cmc swe data were interpolated on the model grid using the nearest neighbor approach fig 6 a shows ubrmsd skill for the ol while fig 6 b presents the skill difference between da and ol simulations using blue and red colors to indicate locations of improvement and deterioration respectively significant improvements in ubrmsd are mainly achieved in the northern canadian rockies cassiar mountains and mackenzie mountains which are characterized by larger swe values compared to the rest of the basin grace da leads to degraded ubrmsd values at the northwestern and western boundaries of the liard basin the reason for degradation may be related to artifacts that are caused by the perturbation fields over these edge regions overall the ubrmsd values are improved for 85 of the grid cells covering the liard basin the largest improvement that was attained is 165 14 mm there are statistically significant improvements in terms of the ubrmsd metric in 56 of grid cells note that 4 of grid cells experience statistically significant degradations in swe estimates from the grace data assimilation maps of the correlations rs for the ol and their differences from the grace da are presented in fig 7 correlation differences fall with the range of 0 25 to 0 26 grid cells that are shown by black dots fig 7 b indicate that correlation differences between ol vs cmc and da vs cmc are statistically significant according to their associated 95 confidence intervals compared to the ol method grace da increased the correlation with cmc swe data for most grid cells covering the basin especially in the areas with large annual snow accumulations like the pattern of ubrmsd differences in fig 6 b a decrease in correlations is observed in a few grid cells that are located at the northwestern and western edges of the liard basin overall grace da improves the correlation skill values in 97 of the grid cells improvements are statistically significant different from zero in 61 of these cells degradation in the correlations is observed in less than 1 of the grid cells in the enks method the ensemble spread is regarded as the standard deviation around the ensemble mean evensen 2003 here the time mean of the monthly ensemble spreads from october 2008 to october 2014 was calculated for both ol and da methods fig 8 a presents the time mean ensemble spread of mesh derived swe for the ol experiment while fig 8 b maps the time mean ensemble spread of the grace da minus the ol method for swe the mean ensemble spread for the ol over all grid cells in the liard basin equals 25 2 mm larger ensemble spreads are found in the mountainous areas of the basin especially in the northern canadian rockies and mackenzie mountains which are dominated by significant seasonal snowpack accumulations smaller ensemble spreads are obtained in the grid cells covering non mountainous areas including the southeastern and eastern parts of the liard basin after assimilating grace observations into the mesh model the spatially averaged reduction in ensemble spread equals 14 4 mm with the exception of one grid cell the ensemble spreads of grace da are smaller than those obtained by the ol method the larger reductions in the uncertainty of swe estimates dark blue in fig 8 b mainly occur in areas where the ol produced large ensemble spreads dark brown in fig 8 a in summary constraining model forecasts by implementing grace da effectively reduced the uncertainty in the mesh derived swe larger reductions in the ensemble spreads are mainly achieved in areas where significant reductions in the ubrmsd actual error values are observed 4 2 3 comparison with snow measurements this study uses mainly cmc swe as a reference product for the comparisons however to further assess the assimilation results the ol and da swe simulations were compared against independent ground based monthly snow survey observations from the three stations available section 2 4 because of the data limitations of the automatic stations over the study period the evaluation could be conducted during only two snow seasons 2013 and 2014 to perform each comparison mesh swe simulations had to be matched in space and time with snow survey observations then evaluation metrics were computed across time the results are presented in table 2 fig 9 shows a time series of the ol and grace da ensemble means along with snow survey observations and cmc swe during the onset of snow the ol da in situ observations and cmc swe estimates agree quite well especially from november to january as small updates were applied to mesh model estimates from february to april when much snow masses were reduced from model simulations differences between swe estimates were observed in terms of pbias skill the grace da reduces the bias in the swe at 4c22p 29 6 for ol 15 8 for da and 4c20p 18 2 for ol 1 7 for da however the absolute value of pbias was increased at the station 4c21p from 2 for ol to 14 1 for da the evaluation results for the ubrmsd skill shows that grace da leads to slight degradations at two snow survey sites compared to ol the correlation skill values were slightly reduced as a result of the assimilation for all three sites however the degradation of da skills for both ubrmsd and rs were not statistically significant at the 95 confidence level relative to the ol simulations in general the effect of grace da on swe estimates at the three snow survey stations was found to be mixed with some patterns of improvements and degradations observed in the intercomparisons to the open loop simulations overall with grace da the metrics obtained with cmc in the grid cell corresponding to each ground based station are not different from those computed for the stations table 2 the pbias improvement follows roughly the same trends the ubrmsd values vary in a tight range between 16 and 25 mm in all cases and the correlations found are quite similar however the comparison here is just indicative and should be considered with caution due to representativeness error as stations only provide point measurements while cmc swe is gridded 4 3 streamflow the performance of ol and grace da in terms of streamflow was evaluated using pbias nse and nselog fig 10 presents daily mesh derived streamflow estimates from the ol and grace da ensembles with the corresponding ensemble spreads daily averages of the streamflow observations over six years from the three selected river stations were compared against the ol and da approaches evaluations are presented in table 3 in terms of pbias skill the grace da reduces the bias in the streamflow at fort liard from 8 5 for ol to 4 7 for da however the bias skills became slightly worse at the stations near the mouth 3 1 for ol 9 1 for da and lower crossing 4 8 for ol 9 7 for da changes in the sign of the bias values from negative to positive are related to the reduction of total flow volumes as a result of decreasing snow accumulation evaluation results for the nse skill show that grace da improves high flow peaks during snowmelt seasons from april to june at both fort liard nse 0 79 for ol nse 0 83 for da and lower crossing nse 0 74 for ol nse 0 86 for da for example da adjusted the streamflow discharge peaks at fort liard station by 2000 m3 s 1 in june 2014 the nse skill remains unchanged for the mouth station both ol and da have negative biases in low flow simulations relative to streamflow observations fig 10 the assimilation of tws retrievals has little effect on the low flow estimates during winter seasons the evaluation results for the nselog skill reveal that very small degradations in low flows occurred at lower crossing during simulation of the da compared to ol the time mean of daily ensemble spreads from october 2008 to october 2014 of river stations was calculated for both ol and da methods results show that reductions of ensemble spreads that were caused by grace da equal 300 2 m3 s 1 for near the mouth 241 6 m3 s 1 for fort liard and 168 0 m3 s 1 for lower crossing in general ol does an acceptable job of estimating streamflow such that a high degree of concordance is achieved between ol simulations and observations the effect of the grace da on the simulations of streamflow is encouraging grace da can correct high peaks so that the general evolution of estimated streamflow corresponds to the gauge observations fairly well the assimilation results show that when the assimilation framework activated the da ensemble mean moves closer to the daily observed streamflow observations relative to the ol simulations the simulation of high flow results using the nse metric at the fort liard and lower crossing stations indicates the effects of grace assimilation on streamflow simulation like the results of modeled swe the assimilation effectively reduces ensemble spread for all stations especially at peak flow times 5 discussion 5 1 evaluation of the results the comparison of the ol and da tws results versus grace derived tws retrievals demonstrates that the enks method can constrain the amplitude of modeled tws dynamics so that close agreement with grace observations is obtained in some cases the lack of updates is observed two possible reasons may cause this small difference first the difference is not large between the model predicted tws and the grace tws observations second the uncertainty of predicted water storage is small relative to the uncertainty of the observations as the uncertainties of different soil layers are not included during this experiment we would expect to observe a small number of updates during summer months when the uncertainty of model estimates are relatively small in comparison to grace observations a near zero covariance structure is produced forman et al 2012 snow simulation results that were obtained in this study are consistent with forman et al 2012 and su et al 2010 who demonstrated that swe estimates could be improved in comparison to the cmc swe data across portions of north america the assimilation of grace observations into the mesh model shows that swe estimates in terms of ubrmsd and spearman s rank correlations that were estimated at the basin and grid scales have been improved the mesh grace da framework generally improved the estimation of swe in the liard basin the gridded results showed areas in which the greatest improvements in terms of temporal correlation and ubrmsd were achieved the gridded scale results reveal that how the data assimilation procedure can effectively transfer information from the coarse scale 150 000 km2 grace tws retrievals to the finer scale 100 km2 model resolution degradation in the estimation of swe was observed in some grid cells as a result of grace assimilation relative to the ol results figs 6 and 7 loss of skills can be explained by some possible factors first the gridded grace observations were processed by averaging up to the liard basin scale assuming spatially uncorrelated errors to make them compatible for integration with the mesh model however it is worth pointing out when the gridded grace observations are used instead of the basin averaged tws values it is recommended to consider the errors of observations to be spatially correlated schumacher et al 2018 2016 forman and reichle 2013 and eicker et al 2014 found that data assimilation of grace tws retrievals performs optimally when observations are assimilated at the smallest spatial scale i e 5 5 such that the observation errors become uncorrelated girotto et al 2016 by considering the optimal spatial scale of grace data for the da the smallest spatial scale in the liard basin at which grace observation can be reasonably resolved is about 150 000 km2 therefore the use of 1 1 gridded grace observations might not change the results since the basin size 275 000 km2 is not substantially larger than the true resolution of observations kumar et al 2016 assimilated both 1 1 gridded and basin averaged grace twsa products into nasa s catchment land surface model clsm over the continental united states conus they obtained small differences between the da of basin averaged and gridded results second in some grid cells where degradations of ubrmsd were observed ol does a reasonable job in estimating swe it is apparent that during the update step the quantity of reduced mass was larger than what was required to be subtracted from the mesh simulations therefore the ubrmsd values were degraded as a result of grace assimilation relative to the ol results third in some grid cells the correlations between ol simulation results and cmc swe were not strong compared to the da results fig 7 correlation values obtained with ol in those areas range between 0 5 and 0 7 this may be explained by the pronounced slope effects on snow accumulation in the grid concerned which are mainly concentrated in the transition zones between the high elevation areas and the lowlands see fig 1 also the lower magnitude of swe in some grid cells in the eastern part may affect the results forth even though the cmc swe product is often considered as a very reliable source for the evaluation of modeled swe it suffers from some limitations including imperfect accumulation and melt model and coarse atmospheric forcing together with the scarcity of in situ snow depth measurements in northern latitudes 55 n brown and brasnett 2010 brown et al 2010 swenson and lawrence 2012 toure et al 2016 over northern latitudes and data sparse areas cmc swe analysis depends mostly on the gem precipitation rather than snow observations in addition snow depth observations tend to be biased to coastal locations or large open areas at airports brown and brasnett 2010 therefore in areas experiencing lack of in situ station data the evaluation of mesh swe estimates based on the cmc swe analysis data becomes likely a model intercomparison rather than a validation with a reference of known uncertainty a number of distinct remarks could be made from the snow survey evaluation first da simulations at the three stations experienced negative biases in march and april 2013 relative to snow observations this could be explained partly by the fact that grace observation was not available in march 2013 thus the analysis or update in the assimilation procedure in march was not performed second in 2013 mesh simulations ol and da showed maximum swe in march while snow observation indicated the maximum values in april a temporal lag of around 15 days was observed between model simulations and snow observations third the data assimilation method performed effectively in the snow season of 2014 such that a close agreement between mesh swe estimates and snow observations was witnessed forth the variations of cmc swe compared to in situ observations show a varying level of agreement based on the year and snowmelt occurrence periods fig 9 this affects the statistics presented in table 2 when the onset period of the snow accumulation is considered november to january the agreement improved significantly for example the ubrmsd found when comparing ol and da to the snow survey stations vary from 6 6 mm to 10 9 mm for ol and from 6 2 mm to 9 7 mm for da a similar improvement was found when ol and da are compared to cmc swe in the grid cells corresponding to station locations 6 2 mm to 9 8 mm for ol and from 4 7 mm to 9 2 mm for da better correlations were also obtained during the onset period 0 94 compared to the whole season table 2 the lack of data during the snowmelt period did not allow any particular analysis for that specific period overall since the number of observations is limited the findings here should be considered with caution even if very encouraging results could be seen during the onset period it is not possible to draw a clear conclusion on whether grace da improves swe estimates compared to the ol simulations at this stage of the study it is also worth to notice that comparing point level measurements from automatic stations to gridded values from mesh or cmc may introduce uncertainties due to swe spatial heterogeneity the limited number of stations used and the short period 2 years do not allow robust conclusions to be drawn however the results shown in fig 9 and table 2 comfort us in the use of cmc as a reference swe product in this study since there is no ideal reliable source of swe data available the assimilation results in the streamflow simulations show that the effect of integrating grace observations is small compared to the effects on modeled tws and swe estimates yet the developed framework can improve high flows especially near the peak summer of rainfall seasons note that fluxes are indirectly updated in the grace da framework they are subsequently modified as a result of the state vector update forman and reichle 2013 schumacher et al 2018 therefore one cannot ignore the influence of grace tws retrievals on streamflow simulations estimates of streamflow for flow volume and low flow were slightly degraded at some stations as a result of grace assimilation the degradation of the streamflow estimate in the liard basin using nasa s clsm model has been reported by forman and reichle 2013 and by forman et al 2012 the loss of skill that is noted in table 3 can be related to different possible reasons first swe is reduced by da in the liard basin which means less swe is available to produce snowmelt streamflow second adding subsurface water in the form of surface and root zone soil moisture during warm seasons leads to more runoff yet water storage increments that were added during the analysis step of assimilation during summer are not sufficient to compensate for deficiencies of the model to simulate adequate streamflow third both ol and da experience negative biases during the winter seasons december to april for the simulation of low flows fig 10 this is particularly obvious during winter when the overland and inter flow components are near zero and the base flow component is the major contributor to winter runoff forman et al 2012 this negative bias may be related to limitations of the mesh model in generating sufficient base flow at three observed stations 5 2 assimilation diagnostics 5 2 1 ensemble spread the ensemble spread is a measure of the uncertainty of the model estimates girotto et al 2019 assimilation results at the basin and gridded scales revealed that observations can substantially reduce uncertainty of the model between the ol and da simulations the results presented here are consistent with the work of forman et al 2012 who demonstrated that grace da is valuable for reducing ensemble spread for the estimation of swe in this study large values of swe ensemble spreads for the ol simulations were encountered in mountainous areas northern canadian rockies cassiar mountains and mackenzie mountains in these areas the actual errors i e the ubrmsd are also large compared to the other regions the large uncertainty that is associated with complex terrain may be related to capa precipitation forcing and the relatively coarse horizontal resolution of the mesh model 10 km lespinas et al 2015 asserted that current limitations of capa can result from different factors including 1 the scarcity of reliable observations in canada 2 problems with observation errors associated with solid precipitation 3 the presence of biases in gem precipitation fields 4 biases that result from data transformation and 5 verification methodology carrera et al 2010 demonstrated that reliable estimation of swe over the canadian rockies can be acquired by increasing the horizontal resolution of climate forcing especially the capa analysis product in complex terrain precipitation and snow accumulation experience high spatial variability due to cloud microphysics and particle transport processes schirmer and jamieson 2015 furthermore in the current liard model set up blowing snow was not considered however this option is available in the mesh configuration blowing snow re distribution can be also an important process that influences accurate snow accumulation macdonald et al 2009 note that the reduction of uncertainty in the model estimates does not necessarily mean that better estimates are achieved when compared to the validation data girotto et al 2019 for example in the region near the northwestern and western boundaries of the basin ensemble spreads were reduced however the ubrmsd values are degraded as a result of the grace assimilation 5 2 2 normalized innovation sequence a filter innovation for a given month k is defined as the difference between the ensemble mean observation and model forecast i e y k h x k f the statistics of the filter innovations is a useful tool to indicate whether or not the choice of the model table 1 and measurement error parameters is appropriate reichle and koster 2002 in a linear system with mutually and serially uncorrelated gaussian model perturbations and observation errors the normalized innovations ni should follow a standard normal distribution zero mean unit variance and temporally uncorrelated kumar et al 2008 even though the filter used here is a smoother rather than a filter and the mesh model is nonlinear deviations of the ni statistics from the theoretical ideals can be used to diagnose useful information as the performance of the da procedure forman et al 2012 the normalized innovation is written as 7 ni k y k h x k f h p k f h t r where the covariance of innovation i e h p k f h t r is based on the combination of the background and measurement error and can be used to normalize the innovations reichle and koster 2002 then the statistics mean and standard deviation of ni are collected as a function of time to assess the performance based on the innovation we did a sensitivity analysis by conducting the data assimilation experiments with a range of different values of grace measurement variance r in eq 7 thus four measurement variance values 72 25 289 650 25 1156 mm2 were chosen following the work of forman et al 2012 and other studies who adopted some of the same values kumar et al 2016 su et al 2010 zaitchik et al 2008 the results of the mean and standard deviation of normalized innovations are shown in fig 11 it is observed that the mean values ni of the normalized innovations using r values of 289 mm2 and 650 25 mm2 equal to zero this implies that the data assimilation simulations are unbiased for these two experiments the noticeable feature is that the mean innovations using two observation errors of 72 25 mm2 and 1156 mm2 have positive and negative biases it is important to note that with increasing observation error variances the variance of innovations σni decreases this reduction is expected as an increase in measurement error causes an increase in the dominator of eq 7 which leads to a reduction in the standard deviation of the normalized innovation based on the information provided by the normalized innovations the selection of the observation error between 289 mm2 and 650 25 mm2 indicates a reasonable data assimilation performance for the mesh model i e a σni close to unity and a ni close to zero these findings are consistent with previous data assimilation studies that considered observation variance between 289 mm2 and 400 mm2 forman et al 2012 forman and reichle 2013 kumar et al 2016 su et al 2010 zaitchik et al 2008 5 2 3 analysis increments examination of analysis increment i e the difference between update and forecast can provide another way of realizing the behavior of the data assimilation system forman et al 2012 it shows how much and at what time information from grace observations in the data assimilation framework affect the estimation of water storage at different vertical layers forman et al 2012 girotto et al 2019 fig 12 shows the monthly basin averaged time series for six years of ensemble average increments of swe and subsurface water storage the negative and positive signs of the increment indicate how the assimilation subtracts and adds water storage in certain months such as march 2013 when the grace observations were not available the increments were all zeros the increments that were applied to swe and subsurface storage are shown with solid blue and black lines respectively analysis increments were applied to all water storage compartments of the mesh model the updates of the other components were not significant when compared to swe and subsurface storage the summation of swe increments for six years equals 127 1 mm assimilation reduces snow mass from the mesh estimates during the snow accumulation seasons from november to may of each year fig 12 a small amount of swe is added back during the spring ablation and snowmelt phases the summation of the subsurface increments over space and time equals 17 90 mm small or near zero numbers of subsurface updates are possibly related to the perturbation structure such that the uncertainties of soil water compartments were not included in the system the pattern rather than the magnitude of increments especially swe was consistent to some extent with those reported by forman et al 2012 who assimilated grace observations into the clsm model in the mackenzie basin together these results verify that grace da has an effect on reducing snow mass during snow accumulation seasons but then increases the mass slightly during warm periods this behavior indicates that grace data contain valuable information that helps to constrain the individual model compartments of the mesh model 6 conclusion this study examined the incorporation and development of the ensemble based mesh grace data assimilation framework into the eccc community environmental modeling for the first time the enks assimilation method in the liard basin was used to integrate grace derived tws data into the mesh model for swe estimates when compared against the cmc swe data data assimilation at the basin scale reduced the bias of the open loop simulation significantly from 46 7 to 29 6 and improved the unbiased rmsd by 23 this confirms that grace tws assimilation has an effect on reducing snow mass during snow accumulation data assimilation also reduced significantly the ensemble spreads in terms of correlations a negligible improvement was observed 0 95 for ol 0 96 for da at the gridded scale the da process showed larger improvements in the ubrmsd compared to the ol mainly in areas with substantial annual snow accumulation particularly in the northern canadian rockies overall the ubrmsd values were improved in 85 of the grid cells in 56 of grid cells the ubrmsd improvements were statistically significant the da method improved the correlations with cmc swe in 97 of the grid cells in 61 of these grid cells the correlation differences between the ol and da differed statistically from zero the grace da approach reduced the ensemble spreads in almost all of the gridded cells the evaluation of the results based on in situ observations from november to april presented a varying level of concordance with better agreements during the snow onset period november to january due to insufficient snow observations during the snowmelt periods the evaluation of the results could not be properly conducted overall more validation data are still needed to better assess the contributions of da compared to ol the impact of grace data assimilation on streamflow simulations was evaluated against observations from three river gauges grace da could effectively improve the simulation of high flows at lower crossing ns 0 74 for ol ns 0 86 for da and fort liard ns 0 76 for ol ns 0 83 for da while it remained unchanged ns 0 76 for the mouth station the influence of grace da on total flow volume and low flows was found to be variable the assimilation procedure can effectively reduce the ensemble spreads in the streamflow simulations especially during peak flow times the assimilation of grace tws retrievals in the liard basin provides some valuable insights for ongoing scientific applications further works will extend the research to different basins with variable climate regimes and swe conditions the use of gridded observations at a finer spatial resolution 1 1 will be investigated by considering the full error covariance of the observations the findings of this research have important implications for evaluating the performance of the mesh grace data assimilation framework for the purpose of improving regional estimates of swe and streamflow these results motivate future efforts to understand the influence of grace data assimilation on the interannual seasonality and sub seasonal variability of swe at basin averaged and gridded scales and investigate whether grace da leads to changes in the timing of snow accumulation ablation phases moreover the possibility of extending the developed methodology to multisource data assimilation could be explored to further improve the accuracy of model estimates credit authorship contribution statement ala bahrami

4664,considerable efforts have been made to understand negative impacts of mining on vegetation conditions for humid regions while little attention has been paid to impacts of mining in dry regions on ecological conditions and groundwater in an integrated way a case study including two mines in inner mongolia of china was conducted to reveal varying influences of mining on ecology and groundwater under various development phases of the mines during 2002 and 2015 three such phases were defined based on impacts of mining induced groundwater variances on vegetation conditions damaging phase post damaging phase and restoration phase in the damaging phase increased by 341 and 166 in baiyin and shengli mine respectively vegetation greenness due to drained groundwater irrigation and associated groundwater storage drawdown by 206 and 60 in baiyin and shengli mine respectively were identified the post damaging phase can be characterized by reduced irrigation due to shutting down of groundwater drainage causing sharp degradation of vegetation by 165 74 and recharging of the groundwater storage by 202 126 below 200 cm depth in baiyin shengli mine and the restoration phase is associated with the termination of the mining and related extraction of groundwater featured by increased vegetation greenness by 277 and groundwater storage by 196 in baiyin mine besides we found vegetation restoration is 1 year ahead of groundwater restoration although the withdrawal of groundwater in the damaging phase boosted thrives of vegetation mining induced groundwater depletion and damaged hydrogeological structure have far reaching implications for local water resources and the living condition of groundwater dependent vegetation in drylands which may raise risks of irreversible vegetation degradation and subsequent desertification in long term droughts keywords vegetation condition groundwater storage mining induced disturbance ecological effects arid and semi arid grassland ecosystem grace 1 introduction vegetation conditions are ecologically critical in global change research and the assessment of ecological environments liu et al 2019 connecting nutrient cycling and energy flow among the pedosphere hydrosphere and atmosphere vereecken et al 2010 climate changes and human interferences are changing vegetation conditions driving soil deterioration marques et al 2008 desertification reynolds et al 2007 as well as reduced land productivity pimentel and kounang 1998 and biodiversity butt et al 2013 recent years have witnessed growing concerns for deforestation and related reduced biodiversity desertification decreased sustainability and numerous local human environment challenges due to mining bebbington and bury 2009 bebbington et al 2018 liu et al 2019 it is particularly the case for vegetation conditions in arid and semiarid zones where landscape ecologies are fragile due to large environmental variability medvigy et al 2010 demand for minerals continues to grow rapidly in emerging economies bebbington and bury 2009 in 2018 coal consumption grew by 1 4 double its 10 year average growth and the coal consumption growth was led by india 36 mtoe and china 16 mtoe global coal production rose by 162 mtoe or 4 3 china 82 mtoe and indonesia 51 mtoe provided the largest increments dudley 2019 therefore it is crucial to understand the impacts of mining on vegetation conditions mining sustainability issue and human environment challenges in general koirala et al 2017 yao et al 2018 orellana et al 2012 and in agro pastoral transitional zone of china in particular mining can directly remove vegetation coverage causing degradation of ecosystem and reduced net primary production butchart et al 2010 gibson et al 2011 pouzols et al 2014 due to desertification and forest degradation actually considerable concerns have been voiced regarding the negative consequences of mining on forests grasslands and hence biodiversity in amazon mining significantly increased amazon forest loss up to 70 km beyond mining lease boundaries causing 11 670 km2 of deforestation during 2005 and 2015 sonter et al 2017 and former study declared that global demands for mineral resources are threat for tropical threats alvarez berríos and aide 2015 meanwhile lithium mining activities act as one of the major stressors to the local environmental degradation in the atacama salt flat the world s largest lithium extraction site due to dramatic and continuous expansion in lithium production since 1997 liu et al 2019 these studies mainly focus on physical damages on vegetation through excavation and infrastructure construction at mine sites but omitted impacts on vegetation caused by mining induced loss of groundwater storage however for groundwater dependent vegetations in inner mongolia of china groundwater is the only reliable water resource for them to live in drylands due to lack of sufficient precipitation koirala et al 2017 the mongolian plateau is dominated by rich mineral resources such as coal gold and copper booming economic development of china is driving higher mineral requirements and therefore mining will most likely continue in the future bulag 2010 however persistently massive mining will continue environmental deterioration across the mongolian plateau former studies have identified that loss of groundwater storage induced by mining activities drove rapid loss of lakes and wetland in grasslands of inner mongolia tao et al 2015 zheng et al 2019 given that vegetation in inner mongolia are mostly groundwater dependent under semi arid climate condition besides directly damages on vegetation through excavation in mine sites mining induced groundwater understanding of impacts of mining induced groundwater loss on vegetation conditions is the necessary step into effective recovery and conservation of grassland in arid and semiarid regions such as the agro pastoral transitional zone of china in this case study fig 1 it should be noted here that water limited ecosystems covered 50 of the global land yang et al 2014 while in 20 90 of global vegetated lands coherent trend was statistically significant between terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa and the ndvi in contrast to a non coherent trend in 20 87 of global vegetated lands xie et al 2019 our understanding of the non coherent trend between twsa and ndvi across 20 87 in global vegetated lands is still incomplete and this study attempts to improve the understanding with help of analysis of vegetation changes in arid and semi arid regions in north china in relation to with massive coal mining activities vegetation greenness is a critical indicator of the availability and variability of soil moisture xie et al 2019 nemani et al 2003 generally vegetation conditions in inner mongolia of china are influenced mainly by climate changes and precipitation changes in particular shen et al 2019 however precipitation only provides part of the indirect information about the surface water conditions yang et al 2014 actually scientific debate is still open for the relationship between variability in vegetation greenness and precipitation forzieri et al 2013 soil moisture changes due to effective precipitation i e the proportion of rainfall that is retained in the soil deep percolation and groundwater discharge greatly complicate the relationship between vegetation and precipitation yang et al 2014 in this way the identification of sources of soil water is critical for understanding of responses of vegetation changes to climate changes or human activities therefore this study attempts to shed new light on dynamic relations between vegetation greenness and groundwater storage clarifying causes behind vegetation greenness in arid and semi arid regions in china 2 study region and data 2 1 study region agro pastoral transitional zone of northern china locates in the southeast of the mongolia plateau and is under continental climate fig 1 due to uneven distribution of precipitation induced by monsoon this region is featured by transition of climate from semi humidity to semi aridity in the east to west direction accordingly landscape within this region transferred significantly from forest and crop land in eastside to grassland and bare land in westside cao et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 and previous study has demonstrated that disturbance from human activity induced the degradation of grassland westside of the agro pastoral transitional zone of northern china zhai et al 2017 given that abundant storage of mineral resources within the grassland area located in the westside of transition region especially open kit coal mines there are plenty of cities with leading industry as mining i e xilinhaote baiyin hulinguole world energy council 2010 and the impacts on fragile grassland ecosystem in the transitional region caused by mining activity cannot be ignored hence to deeply study the coupled feedback mechanisms behind interaction process between vegetation growth and groundwater storage under highly intense extraction of groundwater during mining activity this study selects baiyin mine fig 1b and shengli mine fig 1c as typical studying areas owing to their active and massive productions per year and in this study we defined the impacted area of mining activity as the 1 1 squared area with the mine site in center baiyin mine locates at 118 e 119 e 44 40 n 45 40 n westside of agro pastoral transitional zone of northern china with altitude as 835 m 1957 m and its main climatic type is semi arid grassland climate featured by long cold winter and hot summer with accumulated precipitation its multiple annual mean precipitation is 324 mm and landcover type mainly is grassland accounting for 73 4 while forest and bare land take up 15 83 and 10 05 respectively shengli mine locates at 115 25 e 116 75 e 43 50 n 44 50 n westside of agro pastoral transitional zone of northern china with altitude as 910 1202 m its climatic type is featured by semi arid grassland climate as well with its multiple annual mean precipitation as 275 mm and accordingly same as baiyin mine grassland is the main type of landcover accounting for 88 76 while crop land and bare land take up 2 6 and 7 10 respectively 2 2 data to study the spatiotemporal evolution of 200 cm below

gldas datasets and vci gpp and 0 200 cm soil moisture have been applied to develop integrated ecological index iei through principal component analysis to avoid the spatial disagreement among data

3 1 integrated ecological index iei in this study we proposed the integrated ecological index iei to characterize ecological conditions under the influence of groundwater changes due to mining activity we used the principal component analysis method to include vci gpp and wsw of the 0 200 cm depth for the development of the iei eqs 1 2 for computation in terms of unit we standardized vci

and temperature on vci and gpp solar radiation water resources and air temperature are the climatic factors influencing vegetation growth considering high correlation 0 89 in both shengli and baiyin mine between standardized temperature and short wave radiation fig 2 hence we only take impacts on vegetation from long wave radiation and temperature in this study we exclude impacts of long wave radiation and air temperature on vegetation such as vci and gpp to investigate the coupled dynamic reaction of vegetation growth to groundwater availability and variability medvigy et al 2010 in this study we developed linear regressive relations between gpp vci and net long wave radiation nlw and air temperature t for quantitatively evaluating the impacts of net long wave radiation and air

variations of vegetation and groundwater to show impacts of groundwater variations on vegetation changes however we should first remove the seasonal and random components to acquire the trend component in this study we used the moving average method to separate the seasonal components trends and random components removal of the seasonal and random components can be done based on method by stuart and kendall 1963 the r software package is detrend and can be obtained from https cran r project org web packages detrendr index html 4 results and discussions 4 1 iei vs ggrace dynamic analysis framework here we proposed a dynamic analysis framework based on dynamic analysis of iei vs ggrace relations and identified the following phases damaging phase 1 3 dp1 3 post damaging phase 1 2 pdp1 2 and restoration phase 1 4 res1 4 based on the iei vs ggrace dynamic analysis framework we analyzed the temporal evolution of vegetation conditions with groundwater storage in both baiyin mine and shengli mine 4 1 1 damaging phase at the first stage of coal mining massive human withdrawal of water occurred from wells around the mines and the water from the wells is mostly for irrigation figs 4 5 soni 2019 al hwaiti et al 2016 to recover vegetation after purification by the drainage wells water treatment plant system figs 4 5 this process is dominated by artificial planting of grass and trees usually drought resistant vegetation supporting information fig s1 however during dp1 damaging phase 1 vegetation condition has been modified by irrigation with extracted groundwater fig 6c in this way vegetation changes are influenced mainly by human activities such as irrigation and horticulture therefore during dp1 vegetation indices such as evi ndvi and vci etc cannot reflect impacts of groundwater changes on the vegetation ecosystem however the remarkable loss of groundwater storage distinctly cuts down the capability of arid and semi arid vegetation ecosystems to fight against long term water deficit due to persistent drought conditions and raises the risk of degradation of the vegetation ecosystem under long term drought conditions during dp1 gleick and palaniappan 2010 wada et al 2010 gleeson et al 2012 hanjra and qureshi 2010 castle et al 2014 actually it is a kind of unsustainable use of groundwater resources in the mining regions given that human induced groundwater extraction continues the groundwater storage starts to decrease and cannot support the maintenance of greening of vegetation or increased biomass during dp1 then the interaction of vegetation corresponding to groundwater storage variations gradually moves to dp3 damaging phase 3 fig 6i iei and ggrace both turn to drop during this period the increased plants or biomass during dp1 due to irrigation by the extracted groundwater come to withering after the sharp decrease of human induced extraction of groundwater and local people call this phenomenon as green pollution that covers up the fact of groundwater loss by blooming vegetation 4 1 2 post damaging phase when mining operation surface can be ensured to sustain the dry condition the groundwater level is far lower than the lowest depth of mine human induced extraction of groundwater will stop and the groundwater storage increases due to natural recharge discharge balance of groundwater in this phase irrigation decreases due to sharp decrease of the human induced extraction of groundwater therefore vegetation and biomass degrade since that precipitation amount in the study region cannot support vegetation and biomass maintenance in this case the interaction between vegetation and groundwater storage occurs in the post damaging phases 1 2 pdp1 2 fig 7g h 4 1 3 restoration phase in this phase mining activities end or human extraction of groundwater terminates the interaction between vegetation and groundwater occurs to a restoration phase res1 4 fig 6a b and d e iei and ggrace both tend to increase and the relationship between iei and ggrace is positive taking baiyin mine as a case study the correlation coefficient can reach as high as 0 72 fig 8 from the viewpoint of the vegetation ecosystem across the whole arid and semi arid mining region the greening of vegetation cover in the study can be attributed to irrigation by the withdrawal of groundwater meanwhile groundwater deficit due to the withdrawal of groundwater can form a dried up region and this region lacks soil water and hence forms a dry island this kind of dry island can greatly alter the local climate such as less precipitation and higher air temperature d odorico and porporato 2004 therefore subsequent vegetation degradation and desertification can be expected besides due to sparse precipitation and massive evapotranspiration in the study region vegetative growth is tied closely to the groundwater storage yang et al 2019 the loss of groundwater storage the development potential and solid foundation for arid and semi arid vegetation system will weaken the vegetation system in surviving through long term drought gleick and palaniappan 2010 wada et al 2010 gleeson et al 2012 hanjra and qureshi 2010 castle et al 2014 moreover vegetation is the crucial component of arid and semi arid grassland ecosystems providing vital support for habitation and socioeconomic development in arid and semi arid regions yang et al 2019 li et al 2017 however mining activities greatly damage the hydrogeological structure of mining regions the withdrawal of groundwater from the deep buried depth can greatly lower the buried depth of the phreatic water level because of groundwater depression while plant growth near phreatic aquifer heavily depends on groundwater with levels within the reach of the plant root systems eamus et al 2006 therefore lowered groundwater level and even depletion of groundwater can depress vegetation development this kind of vegetation degradation is irreversible and subsequent desertification is inevitable furthermore wind speed in the study region is large and hence dust storms occur frequently which further deteriorates desertification yang et al 2015 4 2 negative vegetation vs groundwater relations in the baiyin mine and the shengli mine in arid and semi arid regions vegetation relies heavily on the availability and variability of groundwater storage lowry et al 2011 tian et al 2019 cooper et al 2006 in inner mongolia of china the loss of groundwater storage has been regarded as the main cause behind irreversible desertification and degradation of lakes tao et al 2015 yang et al 2015 while mining activity is one of the critical reasons behind the depletion of groundwater storage and posing challenging threats to regional ecosystems to facilitate coal mining rows of drainage wells have been built around the mining zone to cut off hydrological connections between mining zone and outer mining zone keeping the groundwater level below the lowest depth of the mining operation surface and retaining dry conditions for coal mining operation figs 4 and 9 this kind of building of wells for the withdrawal of groundwater greatly altered hydrodynamic properties of groundwater significantly damaging the vertical hydrological structure of the groundwater system generally deficit of soil water and groundwater can drive the deterioration of vegetation cover therefore a close relation can be expected between groundwater and vegetation conditions i e abundant groundwater corresponds to good vegetation conditions and vice versa19 well accepted hydrological connections between vegetation and groundwater can be expected due to the restoration of open pit mines or termination of extraction of groundwater figs 8a b and s10a b w the vegetation condition reflected by iei and iei re would evolve with the same tendency with groundwater storage as reflected by ggrace in open pit mines under this circumstance simultaneous vegetation and groundwater changes can be detected by vegetation condition index vci quiring and ganesh 2010 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi xie et al 2019 and enhanced vegetation index evi wagle et al 2014 meanwhile a comparison study suggests that the response of vegetation greenness to the land water storage is more rapid than that to precipitation xie et al 2019 besides it was found that globally over 16 75 of vegetated areas are dominated by strong interactions between the land water storage and ndvi and vegetation greenness is found to be the cause of the land water storage in over 40 34 of global vegetated areas xie et al 2019 while it was also found that vegetation greenness increased in northern and northwestern china due to the decrease in land water storage however no further interpretations were provided xie et al 2019 however clarification of interactions between groundwater storage and vegetation conditions is critical in north china and in water limited growth regions as well shen et al 2019 in this study we found a significant negative relationship between vegetation condition reflected by integrated ecology index iei and iei re and groundwater storage reflected by equivalent depth of groundwater storage below 200 cm ggrace at open pit mining sites generally we identified two occasions occasion 1 decreased groundwater storage but enhanced vegetation biomass and occasion 2 restoration of groundwater storage and sharp reduction of vegetation biomass iei and iei re had generally negative relations with ggrace fig 7e f and the correlation coefficients reached as much as 0 95 figs 8 and 10 the deviation between iei and iei re and ggrace was larger before about 2009 than that after 2009 in the baiyin mine fig 7e while the deviation between iei and iei re and ggrace was fluctuating with considerable deviation during the entire study period in the shengli mine fig 7f vegetation conditions were influenced mainly by grass and or tree planting with sufficient water supply before about 2009 in baiyin mine vegetations were newly planted and irrigated and therefore heavily depended on irrigation by water withdrawal from drainage wells however this kind of vegetation change with groundwater storage was variable between baiyin and shengli mines the larger magnitude of vegetation changes can still be observed in shengli mine than in baiyin mine which can be attributed to different irrigation practices and vegetation maintenance practices between these two mines the baiyin and shengli mines are both open pit mines drainage wells were built to drain groundwater to ensure dry conditions of the mining operation surface meanwhile the drained groundwater is further processed through drainage purification system for irrigation for planting of vegetation of the mining regions and also rejuvenating of the vegetation coverage nearby the mining regions figs 4 6 and 9 irrigation and relevant planting of trees and grasses green the mining regions and areas in the vicinity of mining regions however massive withdrawal of groundwater greatly lowers the groundwater level which is the major reason behind negative relations between vegetation condition and groundwater storage i e occasion 1 defined as dp1 of iei vs ggrace indices system iei iei re increased by 341 358 while ggrace decreased by 206 from october 2002 to february 2005 in the baiyin mine fig 11a b and g h during the period from june 2007 to june 2008 iei iei re increased by 110 96 while ggrace dropped by 2037 in the baiyin mine fig 11d e and j k similarly iei iei re increased by 166 166 while ggrace dropped by 60 from october 2002 to october 2003 in the shengli mine fig 12a b and h i during december 2009 january 2013 iei iei re increased by 284 with the decrease of ggrace by 1964 fig 12e f and l m in this case irrigation by withdrawal of groundwater for coal mining activities was the main reason behind the increased vegetation greenness therefore human interferences accelerate or intensify vegetation impacts on land water storage via terrestrial evapotranspiration as has been found elsewhere wei et al 2018 given that the groundwater level is low enough to satisfy the requirements of coal mining practice the drainage purification system will be shut down and then follows occasion 2 showing negative vegetation vs groundwater relation pdp1 of iei vs ggrace indices system fig 6g during occasion 2 groundwater storage steadily increases in the regions in the vicinity of mining sites however lack of irrigation from drainage water and greenness by irrigation depressed and hence biomass decreased taking the baiyin mine as a case study during occasion 2 iei dropped by 165 while ggrace increased by 202 fig 11b c during february 2005 february 2006 fig 11b c and h i besides occasion 2 also occurred to the shengli mine in which iei dropped by 74 while ggrace increased by 126 during january 2013 june 2015 fig 12f g and m n groundwater depletion of the mining regions also drives the depressed vegetation greenness 4 3 restoration of open pit mines vegetation conditions or groundwater storage vegetation indices such as vci evi gpp are employed for monitoring vegetation changes for vegetation changes in arid and semi arid regions the availability and variability of water are the key factors behind vegetation changes although these vegetation indices cannot fully reflect the impacts of hydrological components such as groundwater storage in this study on vegetation changes meanwhile for mining regions the recovery process of mining sites is relevant to two sides i e recovery and maintenance of vegetation cover and recharge of the groundwater storage below 200 cm depth however mining activities break the hydrogeological structure of the coal mining regions and massively extract groundwater therefore greening vegetation alone cannot fully reflect the recovery of mining sites taking the baiyin mine as an example fig 11d f and j l iei iei re increased during june 2007 june 2015 and increased by 123 108 given the vegetation index as the only indicator for recovery of coal mine we may determine that the baiyin mine was in recovery since june 2007 fig 11d and j considering groundwater storage as an indicator of the recovery of coal mining sites ggrace dropped to the minimum value 0 35 during the entire study period i e from june 2007 to august 2008 which is a 2037 reduction of ggrace in this period fig 11d e after august 2008 iei and ggrace both steadily increased therefore we can determine that the time point of august 2008 was the starting time of recovery of the coal mining sites in the study region fig 11e in this way iei vs ggrace dynamic analysis framework proposed in this study sheds new light on the impacts of coal mining activities on relations between groundwater storage and vegetation conditions 5 conclusions massive mining activities in arid and semi arid zones where ecosystem highly depends on groundwater storage will violate the natural balance between vegetation development and groundwater storage and will alter the dynamic interactions between vegetation and groundwater storage variations unlikely traditional understanding that loss of groundwater storage would trigger instant corresponding degradation of groundwater dependent vegetation mainly due to disturbance induced by massive extraction of groundwater during mining operation reversed temporal connections between vegetation and groundwater storage have been detected here through newly developed iei vs ggrace dynamic framework that comprehensively reflected the interaction mechanism between vegetation and groundwater storage based on iei vs ggrace dynamic framework three such phases between vegetation and groundwater storage were defined damaging phase post damaging phase and recovery phase in all dynamic reversed relation can be classified as two main patterns 1 in the damaging phase increased vegetation greenness due to irrigation by using the drained groundwater and associated groundwater storage drawdown were identified i e iei increased by 341 while ggrace dropped by 206 in the baiyin mine during oct 2002 feb 2005 2 in the post damaging phase due to temporal shutting down of groundwater drainage loss of enough water supply from drainage groundwater surge vegetation biomass in the damaging phase came to drop sharply while 200 cm below groundwater storage was undergoing natural restoration i e iei dropped by 100 while ggrace increased by 126 in the shengli mine during dec 2012 jun 2015 new illustration of the reversed interaction mechanisms would provide the full picture of vegetation and groundwater storage with local relative staff instead of covering the truth of depletion of groundwater storage by surge vegetation biomass during mining operation especially considering that mining induced groundwater depletion greatly reduces mitigation and resilience of the mining regions to droughts and hence higher increase risk of forest and grassland degradation gleick and palaniappan 2010 wada et al 2010 gleeson et al 2012 besides based on this iei vs ggrace dynamic framework we found that restoration of vegetation greenness will be ahead of restoration of groundwater storage in arid and semi arid regions taking baiyin mine for example the lag of groundwater restoration was 1 year later than recovery of vegetation greenness while vegetation greenness was found to exhibit a common 0 to 1 month delayed response to the twsa xie et al 2019 further in global sense a prevailing time lag effect of precipitation was also observed on vegetation greenness wu et al 2015 and the time lag effects of water on vegetation greenness heavily depends on sources of water resources therefore for arid and semi arid ecosystem that highly depends on groundwater storage the actual start of ecosystem restoration should involve both restoration of vegetation and recharge of groundwater furthermore in some water limited growth areas soil moisture has been shown to be an excellent predictor of vegetation dynamics wang et al 2018 detection of reversed temporal connection and time lag between the restoration of vegetation and groundwater would pave solid foundation for future ecological models particularly in arid and semi arid mining regions on understanding disturbance caused by human activity which would reduce chances of introducing uncertainties into future ecological model significantly credit authorship contribution statement zexi shen

4664,considerable efforts have been made to understand negative impacts of mining on vegetation conditions for humid regions while little attention has been paid to impacts of mining in dry regions on ecological conditions and groundwater in an integrated way a case study including two mines in inner mongolia of china was conducted to reveal varying influences of mining on ecology and groundwater under various development phases of the mines during 2002 and 2015 three such phases were defined based on impacts of mining induced groundwater variances on vegetation conditions damaging phase post damaging phase and restoration phase in the damaging phase increased by 341 and 166 in baiyin and shengli mine respectively vegetation greenness due to drained groundwater irrigation and associated groundwater storage drawdown by 206 and 60 in baiyin and shengli mine respectively were identified the post damaging phase can be characterized by reduced irrigation due to shutting down of groundwater drainage causing sharp degradation of vegetation by 165 74 and recharging of the groundwater storage by 202 126 below 200 cm depth in baiyin shengli mine and the restoration phase is associated with the termination of the mining and related extraction of groundwater featured by increased vegetation greenness by 277 and groundwater storage by 196 in baiyin mine besides we found vegetation restoration is 1 year ahead of groundwater restoration although the withdrawal of groundwater in the damaging phase boosted thrives of vegetation mining induced groundwater depletion and damaged hydrogeological structure have far reaching implications for local water resources and the living condition of groundwater dependent vegetation in drylands which may raise risks of irreversible vegetation degradation and subsequent desertification in long term droughts keywords vegetation condition groundwater storage mining induced disturbance ecological effects arid and semi arid grassland ecosystem grace 1 introduction vegetation conditions are ecologically critical in global change research and the assessment of ecological environments liu et al 2019 connecting nutrient cycling and energy flow among the pedosphere hydrosphere and atmosphere vereecken et al 2010 climate changes and human interferences are changing vegetation conditions driving soil deterioration marques et al 2008 desertification reynolds et al 2007 as well as reduced land productivity pimentel and kounang 1998 and biodiversity butt et al 2013 recent years have witnessed growing concerns for deforestation and related reduced biodiversity desertification decreased sustainability and numerous local human environment challenges due to mining bebbington and bury 2009 bebbington et al 2018 liu et al 2019 it is particularly the case for vegetation conditions in arid and semiarid zones where landscape ecologies are fragile due to large environmental variability medvigy et al 2010 demand for minerals continues to grow rapidly in emerging economies bebbington and bury 2009 in 2018 coal consumption grew by 1 4 double its 10 year average growth and the coal consumption growth was led by india 36 mtoe and china 16 mtoe global coal production rose by 162 mtoe or 4 3 china 82 mtoe and indonesia 51 mtoe provided the largest increments dudley 2019 therefore it is crucial to understand the impacts of mining on vegetation conditions mining sustainability issue and human environment challenges in general koirala et al 2017 yao et al 2018 orellana et al 2012 and in agro pastoral transitional zone of china in particular mining can directly remove vegetation coverage causing degradation of ecosystem and reduced net primary production butchart et al 2010 gibson et al 2011 pouzols et al 2014 due to desertification and forest degradation actually considerable concerns have been voiced regarding the negative consequences of mining on forests grasslands and hence biodiversity in amazon mining significantly increased amazon forest loss up to 70 km beyond mining lease boundaries causing 11 670 km2 of deforestation during 2005 and 2015 sonter et al 2017 and former study declared that global demands for mineral resources are threat for tropical threats alvarez berríos and aide 2015 meanwhile lithium mining activities act as one of the major stressors to the local environmental degradation in the atacama salt flat the world s largest lithium extraction site due to dramatic and continuous expansion in lithium production since 1997 liu et al 2019 these studies mainly focus on physical damages on vegetation through excavation and infrastructure construction at mine sites but omitted impacts on vegetation caused by mining induced loss of groundwater storage however for groundwater dependent vegetations in inner mongolia of china groundwater is the only reliable water resource for them to live in drylands due to lack of sufficient precipitation koirala et al 2017 the mongolian plateau is dominated by rich mineral resources such as coal gold and copper booming economic development of china is driving higher mineral requirements and therefore mining will most likely continue in the future bulag 2010 however persistently massive mining will continue environmental deterioration across the mongolian plateau former studies have identified that loss of groundwater storage induced by mining activities drove rapid loss of lakes and wetland in grasslands of inner mongolia tao et al 2015 zheng et al 2019 given that vegetation in inner mongolia are mostly groundwater dependent under semi arid climate condition besides directly damages on vegetation through excavation in mine sites mining induced groundwater understanding of impacts of mining induced groundwater loss on vegetation conditions is the necessary step into effective recovery and conservation of grassland in arid and semiarid regions such as the agro pastoral transitional zone of china in this case study fig 1 it should be noted here that water limited ecosystems covered 50 of the global land yang et al 2014 while in 20 90 of global vegetated lands coherent trend was statistically significant between terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa and the ndvi in contrast to a non coherent trend in 20 87 of global vegetated lands xie et al 2019 our understanding of the non coherent trend between twsa and ndvi across 20 87 in global vegetated lands is still incomplete and this study attempts to improve the understanding with help of analysis of vegetation changes in arid and semi arid regions in north china in relation to with massive coal mining activities vegetation greenness is a critical indicator of the availability and variability of soil moisture xie et al 2019 nemani et al 2003 generally vegetation conditions in inner mongolia of china are influenced mainly by climate changes and precipitation changes in particular shen et al 2019 however precipitation only provides part of the indirect information about the surface water conditions yang et al 2014 actually scientific debate is still open for the relationship between variability in vegetation greenness and precipitation forzieri et al 2013 soil moisture changes due to effective precipitation i e the proportion of rainfall that is retained in the soil deep percolation and groundwater discharge greatly complicate the relationship between vegetation and precipitation yang et al 2014 in this way the identification of sources of soil water is critical for understanding of responses of vegetation changes to climate changes or human activities therefore this study attempts to shed new light on dynamic relations between vegetation greenness and groundwater storage clarifying causes behind vegetation greenness in arid and semi arid regions in china 2 study region and data 2 1 study region agro pastoral transitional zone of northern china locates in the southeast of the mongolia plateau and is under continental climate fig 1 due to uneven distribution of precipitation induced by monsoon this region is featured by transition of climate from semi humidity to semi aridity in the east to west direction accordingly landscape within this region transferred significantly from forest and crop land in eastside to grassland and bare land in westside cao et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 and previous study has demonstrated that disturbance from human activity induced the degradation of grassland westside of the agro pastoral transitional zone of northern china zhai et al 2017 given that abundant storage of mineral resources within the grassland area located in the westside of transition region especially open kit coal mines there are plenty of cities with leading industry as mining i e xilinhaote baiyin hulinguole world energy council 2010 and the impacts on fragile grassland ecosystem in the transitional region caused by mining activity cannot be ignored hence to deeply study the coupled feedback mechanisms behind interaction process between vegetation growth and groundwater storage under highly intense extraction of groundwater during mining activity this study selects baiyin mine fig 1b and shengli mine fig 1c as typical studying areas owing to their active and massive productions per year and in this study we defined the impacted area of mining activity as the 1 1 squared area with the mine site in center baiyin mine locates at 118 e 119 e 44 40 n 45 40 n westside of agro pastoral transitional zone of northern china with altitude as 835 m 1957 m and its main climatic type is semi arid grassland climate featured by long cold winter and hot summer with accumulated precipitation its multiple annual mean precipitation is 324 mm and landcover type mainly is grassland accounting for 73 4 while forest and bare land take up 15 83 and 10 05 respectively shengli mine locates at 115 25 e 116 75 e 43 50 n 44 50 n westside of agro pastoral transitional zone of northern china with altitude as 910 1202 m its climatic type is featured by semi arid grassland climate as well with its multiple annual mean precipitation as 275 mm and accordingly same as baiyin mine grassland is the main type of landcover accounting for 88 76 while crop land and bare land take up 2 6 and 7 10 respectively 2 2 data to study the spatiotemporal evolution of 200 cm below

growth of vegetation state furthermore given that soil moisture has been shown to be an excellent predictor of vegetation dynamics wang et al 2018 0 200 cm soil moisture data has been extracted from gldas datasets and vci gpp and 0 200 cm soil moisture have been applied to develop integrated ecological index iei through principal component analysis to avoid the spatial disagreement among data revolutions of data have been downscaled to 0 025 0 025 using bilinear interpolation method chen et al 2019 details of data could be referred to supporting information text s1 3 materials and methods 3 1 integrated ecological index iei in this study we proposed the integrated ecological index iei to characterize ecological conditions under the influence of groundwater changes due to mining activity we used the principal component analysis method to include vci gpp and wsw of the 0 200 cm depth for the development of the iei eqs 1 2 for computation in terms of unit we standardized vci

and temperature on vci and gpp solar radiation water resources and air temperature are the climatic factors influencing vegetation growth considering high correlation 0 89 in both shengli and baiyin mine between standardized temperature and short wave radiation fig 2 hence we only take impacts on vegetation from long wave radiation and temperature in this study we exclude impacts of long wave radiation and air temperature on vegetation such as vci and gpp to investigate the coupled dynamic reaction of vegetation growth to groundwater availability and variability medvigy et al 2010 in this study we developed linear regressive relations between gpp vci and net long wave radiation nlw and air temperature t for quantitatively evaluating the impacts of net long wave radiation and air

variations of vegetation and groundwater to show impacts of groundwater variations on vegetation changes however we should first remove the seasonal and random components to acquire the trend component in this study we used the moving average method to separate the seasonal components trends and random components removal of the seasonal and random components can be done based on method by stuart and kendall 1963 the r software package is detrend and can be obtained from https cran r project org web packages detrendr index html 4 results and discussions 4 1 iei vs ggrace dynamic analysis framework here we proposed a dynamic analysis framework based on dynamic analysis of iei vs ggrace relations and identified the following phases damaging phase 1 3 dp1 3 post damaging phase 1 2 pdp1 2 and restoration phase 1 4 res1 4 based on the iei vs ggrace dynamic analysis framework we analyzed the temporal evolution of vegetation conditions with groundwater storage in both baiyin mine and shengli mine 4 1 1 damaging phase at the first stage of coal mining massive human withdrawal of water occurred from wells around the mines and the water from the wells is mostly for irrigation figs 4 5 soni 2019 al hwaiti et al 2016 to recover vegetation after purification by the drainage wells water treatment plant system figs 4 5 this process is dominated by artificial planting of grass and trees usually drought resistant vegetation supporting information fig s1 however during dp1 damaging phase 1 vegetation condition has been modified by irrigation with extracted groundwater fig 6c in this way vegetation changes are influenced mainly by human activities such as irrigation and horticulture therefore during dp1 vegetation indices such as evi ndvi and vci etc cannot reflect impacts of groundwater changes on the vegetation ecosystem however the remarkable loss of groundwater storage distinctly cuts down the capability of arid and semi arid vegetation ecosystems to fight against long term water deficit due to persistent drought conditions and raises the risk of degradation of the vegetation ecosystem under long term drought conditions during dp1 gleick and palaniappan 2010 wada et al 2010 gleeson et al 2012 hanjra and qureshi 2010 castle et al 2014 actually it is a kind of unsustainable use of groundwater resources in the mining regions given that human induced groundwater extraction continues the groundwater storage starts to decrease and cannot support the maintenance of greening of vegetation or increased biomass during dp1 then the interaction of vegetation corresponding to groundwater storage variations gradually moves to dp3 damaging phase 3 fig 6i iei and ggrace both turn to drop during this period the increased plants or biomass during dp1 due to irrigation by the extracted groundwater come to withering after the sharp decrease of human induced extraction of groundwater and local people call this phenomenon as green pollution that covers up the fact of groundwater loss by blooming vegetation 4 1 2 post damaging phase when mining operation surface can be ensured to sustain the dry condition the groundwater level is far lower than the lowest depth of mine human induced extraction of groundwater will stop and the groundwater storage increases due to natural recharge discharge balance of groundwater in this phase irrigation decreases due to sharp decrease of the human induced extraction of groundwater therefore vegetation and biomass degrade since that precipitation amount in the study region cannot support vegetation and biomass maintenance in this case the interaction between vegetation and groundwater storage occurs in the post damaging phases 1 2 pdp1 2 fig 7g h 4 1 3 restoration phase in this phase mining activities end or human extraction of groundwater terminates the interaction between vegetation and groundwater occurs to a restoration phase res1 4 fig 6a b and d e iei and ggrace both tend to increase and the relationship between iei and ggrace is positive taking baiyin mine as a case study the correlation coefficient can reach as high as 0 72 fig 8 from the viewpoint of the vegetation ecosystem across the whole arid and semi arid mining region the greening of vegetation cover in the study can be attributed to irrigation by the withdrawal of groundwater meanwhile groundwater deficit due to the withdrawal of groundwater can form a dried up region and this region lacks soil water and hence forms a dry island this kind of dry island can greatly alter the local climate such as less precipitation and higher air temperature d odorico and porporato 2004 therefore subsequent vegetation degradation and desertification can be expected besides due to sparse precipitation and massive evapotranspiration in the study region vegetative growth is tied closely to the groundwater storage yang et al 2019 the loss of groundwater storage the development potential and solid foundation for arid and semi arid vegetation system will weaken the vegetation system in surviving through long term drought gleick and palaniappan 2010 wada et al 2010 gleeson et al 2012 hanjra and qureshi 2010 castle et al 2014 moreover vegetation is the crucial component of arid and semi arid grassland ecosystems providing vital support for habitation and socioeconomic development in arid and semi arid regions yang et al 2019 li et al 2017 however mining activities greatly damage the hydrogeological structure of mining regions the withdrawal of groundwater from the deep buried depth can greatly lower the buried depth of the phreatic water level because of groundwater depression while plant growth near phreatic aquifer heavily depends on groundwater with levels within the reach of the plant root systems eamus et al 2006 therefore lowered groundwater level and even depletion of groundwater can depress vegetation development this kind of vegetation degradation is irreversible and subsequent desertification is inevitable furthermore wind speed in the study region is large and hence dust storms occur frequently which further deteriorates desertification yang et al 2015 4 2 negative vegetation vs groundwater relations in the baiyin mine and the shengli mine in arid and semi arid regions vegetation relies heavily on the availability and variability of groundwater storage lowry et al 2011 tian et al 2019 cooper et al 2006 in inner mongolia of china the loss of groundwater storage has been regarded as the main cause behind irreversible desertification and degradation of lakes tao et al 2015 yang et al 2015 while mining activity is one of the critical reasons behind the depletion of groundwater storage and posing challenging threats to regional ecosystems to facilitate coal mining rows of drainage wells have been built around the mining zone to cut off hydrological connections between mining zone and outer mining zone keeping the groundwater level below the lowest depth of the mining operation surface and retaining dry conditions for coal mining operation figs 4 and 9 this kind of building of wells for the withdrawal of groundwater greatly altered hydrodynamic properties of groundwater significantly damaging the vertical hydrological structure of the groundwater system generally deficit of soil water and groundwater can drive the deterioration of vegetation cover therefore a close relation can be expected between groundwater and vegetation conditions i e abundant groundwater corresponds to good vegetation conditions and vice versa19 well accepted hydrological connections between vegetation and groundwater can be expected due to the restoration of open pit mines or termination of extraction of groundwater figs 8a b and s10a b w the vegetation condition reflected by iei and iei re would evolve with the same tendency with groundwater storage as reflected by ggrace in open pit mines under this circumstance simultaneous vegetation and groundwater changes can be detected by vegetation condition index vci quiring and ganesh 2010 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi xie et al 2019 and enhanced vegetation index evi wagle et al 2014 meanwhile a comparison study suggests that the response of vegetation greenness to the land water storage is more rapid than that to precipitation xie et al 2019 besides it was found that globally over 16 75 of vegetated areas are dominated by strong interactions between the land water storage and ndvi and vegetation greenness is found to be the cause of the land water storage in over 40 34 of global vegetated areas xie et al 2019 while it was also found that vegetation greenness increased in northern and northwestern china due to the decrease in land water storage however no further interpretations were provided xie et al 2019 however clarification of interactions between groundwater storage and vegetation conditions is critical in north china and in water limited growth regions as well shen et al 2019 in this study we found a significant negative relationship between vegetation condition reflected by integrated ecology index iei and iei re and groundwater storage reflected by equivalent depth of groundwater storage below 200 cm ggrace at open pit mining sites generally we identified two occasions occasion 1 decreased groundwater storage but enhanced vegetation biomass and occasion 2 restoration of groundwater storage and sharp reduction of vegetation biomass iei and iei re had generally negative relations with ggrace fig 7e f and the correlation coefficients reached as much as 0 95 figs 8 and 10 the deviation between iei and iei re and ggrace was larger before about 2009 than that after 2009 in the baiyin mine fig 7e while the deviation between iei and iei re and ggrace was fluctuating with considerable deviation during the entire study period in the shengli mine fig 7f vegetation conditions were influenced mainly by grass and or tree planting with sufficient water supply before about 2009 in baiyin mine vegetations were newly planted and irrigated and therefore heavily depended on irrigation by water withdrawal from drainage wells however this kind of vegetation change with groundwater storage was variable between baiyin and shengli mines the larger magnitude of vegetation changes can still be observed in shengli mine than in baiyin mine which can be attributed to different irrigation practices and vegetation maintenance practices between these two mines the baiyin and shengli mines are both open pit mines drainage wells were built to drain groundwater to ensure dry conditions of the mining operation surface meanwhile the drained groundwater is further processed through drainage purification system for irrigation for planting of vegetation of the mining regions and also rejuvenating of the vegetation coverage nearby the mining regions figs 4 6 and 9 irrigation and relevant planting of trees and grasses green the mining regions and areas in the vicinity of mining regions however massive withdrawal of groundwater greatly lowers the groundwater level which is the major reason behind negative relations between vegetation condition and groundwater storage i e occasion 1 defined as dp1 of iei vs ggrace indices system iei iei re increased by 341 358 while ggrace decreased by 206 from october 2002 to february 2005 in the baiyin mine fig 11a b and g h during the period from june 2007 to june 2008 iei iei re increased by 110 96 while ggrace dropped by 2037 in the baiyin mine fig 11d e and j k similarly iei iei re increased by 166 166 while ggrace dropped by 60 from october 2002 to october 2003 in the shengli mine fig 12a b and h i during december 2009 january 2013 iei iei re increased by 284 with the decrease of ggrace by 1964 fig 12e f and l m in this case irrigation by withdrawal of groundwater for coal mining activities was the main reason behind the increased vegetation greenness therefore human interferences accelerate or intensify vegetation impacts on land water storage via terrestrial evapotranspiration as has been found elsewhere wei et al 2018 given that the groundwater level is low enough to satisfy the requirements of coal mining practice the drainage purification system will be shut down and then follows occasion 2 showing negative vegetation vs groundwater relation pdp1 of iei vs ggrace indices system fig 6g during occasion 2 groundwater storage steadily increases in the regions in the vicinity of mining sites however lack of irrigation from drainage water and greenness by irrigation depressed and hence biomass decreased taking the baiyin mine as a case study during occasion 2 iei dropped by 165 while ggrace increased by 202 fig 11b c during february 2005 february 2006 fig 11b c and h i besides occasion 2 also occurred to the shengli mine in which iei dropped by 74 while ggrace increased by 126 during january 2013 june 2015 fig 12f g and m n groundwater depletion of the mining regions also drives the depressed vegetation greenness 4 3 restoration of open pit mines vegetation conditions or groundwater storage vegetation indices such as vci evi gpp are employed for monitoring vegetation changes for vegetation changes in arid and semi arid regions the availability and variability of water are the key factors behind vegetation changes although these vegetation indices cannot fully reflect the impacts of hydrological components such as groundwater storage in this study on vegetation changes meanwhile for mining regions the recovery process of mining sites is relevant to two sides i e recovery and maintenance of vegetation cover and recharge of the groundwater storage below 200 cm depth however mining activities break the hydrogeological structure of the coal mining regions and massively extract groundwater therefore greening vegetation alone cannot fully reflect the recovery of mining sites taking the baiyin mine as an example fig 11d f and j l iei iei re increased during june 2007 june 2015 and increased by 123 108 given the vegetation index as the only indicator for recovery of coal mine we may determine that the baiyin mine was in recovery since june 2007 fig 11d and j considering groundwater storage as an indicator of the recovery of coal mining sites ggrace dropped to the minimum value 0 35 during the entire study period i e from june 2007 to august 2008 which is a 2037 reduction of ggrace in this period fig 11d e after august 2008 iei and ggrace both steadily increased therefore we can determine that the time point of august 2008 was the starting time of recovery of the coal mining sites in the study region fig 11e in this way iei vs ggrace dynamic analysis framework proposed in this study sheds new light on the impacts of coal mining activities on relations between groundwater storage and vegetation conditions 5 conclusions massive mining activities in arid and semi arid zones where ecosystem highly depends on groundwater storage will violate the natural balance between vegetation development and groundwater storage and will alter the dynamic interactions between vegetation and groundwater storage variations unlikely traditional understanding that loss of groundwater storage would trigger instant corresponding degradation of groundwater dependent vegetation mainly due to disturbance induced by massive extraction of groundwater during mining operation reversed temporal connections between vegetation and groundwater storage have been detected here through newly developed iei vs ggrace dynamic framework that comprehensively reflected the interaction mechanism between vegetation and groundwater storage based on iei vs ggrace dynamic framework three such phases between vegetation and groundwater storage were defined damaging phase post damaging phase and recovery phase in all dynamic reversed relation can be classified as two main patterns 1 in the damaging phase increased vegetation greenness due to irrigation by using the drained groundwater and associated groundwater storage drawdown were identified i e iei increased by 341 while ggrace dropped by 206 in the baiyin mine during oct 2002 feb 2005 2 in the post damaging phase due to temporal shutting down of groundwater drainage loss of enough water supply from drainage groundwater surge vegetation biomass in the damaging phase came to drop sharply while 200 cm below groundwater storage was undergoing natural restoration i e iei dropped by 100 while ggrace increased by 126 in the shengli mine during dec 2012 jun 2015 new illustration of the reversed interaction mechanisms would provide the full picture of vegetation and groundwater storage with local relative staff instead of covering the truth of depletion of groundwater storage by surge vegetation biomass during mining operation especially considering that mining induced groundwater depletion greatly reduces mitigation and resilience of the mining regions to droughts and hence higher increase risk of forest and grassland degradation gleick and palaniappan 2010 wada et al 2010 gleeson et al 2012 besides based on this iei vs ggrace dynamic framework we found that restoration of vegetation greenness will be ahead of restoration of groundwater storage in arid and semi arid regions taking baiyin mine for example the lag of groundwater restoration was 1 year later than recovery of vegetation greenness while vegetation greenness was found to exhibit a common 0 to 1 month delayed response to the twsa xie et al 2019 further in global sense a prevailing time lag effect of precipitation was also observed on vegetation greenness wu et al 2015 and the time lag effects of water on vegetation greenness heavily depends on sources of water resources therefore for arid and semi arid ecosystem that highly depends on groundwater storage the actual start of ecosystem restoration should involve both restoration of vegetation and recharge of groundwater furthermore in some water limited growth areas soil moisture has been shown to be an excellent predictor of vegetation dynamics wang et al 2018 detection of reversed temporal connection and time lag between the restoration of vegetation and groundwater would pave solid foundation for future ecological models particularly in arid and semi arid mining regions on understanding disturbance caused by human activity which would reduce chances of introducing uncertainties into future ecological model significantly credit authorship contribution statement zexi shen
