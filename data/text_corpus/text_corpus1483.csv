7415,climate change will be particularly experienced though the medium of water water organisations that are managing societal and ecological needs for water are therefore likely to experience the impact the most this study reviews the current literature regarding adaptation to climate change by water management organisations and associated barriers literature on adaptive capacity is growing and a general consensus is emerging on the determinants of adaptive capacity although variations exist regarding how it is to be evaluated enhanced and applied to policy making due to its dynamic contextual and latent nature since adaptive capacity is hard to measure and successful adaptation difficult to define some studies focus on the existence of adaptation attributes of organisations studies reporting successful adaptation are minimal and barriers of adaptation are being discovered as adaptation research transitions into implementation but the root causes of these barriers are often overlooked and the interconnectedness of the barriers is poorly addressed increasingly combining top down and bottom up approaches to adaptation is being recommended due to the limitations of each however knowledge regarding how organisations operating at different scales can enhance adaptive capacity of other organisations operating at another scale is lacking due to the few studies of inter organisational networks across scales social networks among actors are recognised as a key factor to enable adaptation however network studies generally focus on individual actors and rarely between public agencies organisations moreover the current literature is inadequate to understand the relationship between adaptation enabling characteristics barriers and adaptation manifestation the review demonstrates that research on understanding the emergence and sustenance of barriers is urgently required addressing these knowledge gaps will help to improve the design of adaptation strategies thereby improving the ability of water management to address the ongoing challenges of climate change keywords adaptation adaptive capacity barriers climate change inter organisational networks water management organisations 1 introduction changes in recent climate and associated impacts on natural and human systems have been reported widely ipcc 2014a these include changing precipitation and snow melt altering water resources arnell 2004 kundzewicz et al 2008 and hydro geo logical behaviour holman 2006 leading to floods and droughts barnett et al 2005 jaswal et al 2015 rajeevan et al 2008 singh et al 2016 upgupta et al 2015 xu et al 2009 climate change is also likely to impact water quality whitehead et al 2009 including increased sediment loads during floods wulf et al 2012 and increased contaminant concentration during the dry season whitehead et al 2009 temperature increases are likely to increase water demand holman 2006 particularly in irrigation wang et al 2014 due to increased evapotranspiration in short the immediate and direct impacts of climate change are going to be particularly experienced through the medium of water the compelling and growing body of evidence of a changing climate points to the urgent need for adaptation actions to compliment mitigation füssel 2007 simonet and fatorić 2015 due to the emissions already committed ipcc 2007 and the inadequacy of international agreements for reducing greenhouse emissions spash 2016 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014b p 1758 defined adaptation as the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects within human systems adaptation is aimed at moderating or alleviating harmful effects or to take advantage of the beneficial opportunities noble et al 2014 through anticipatory autonomous and or planned actions mimura et al 2014 preston et al 2013 however actions solely focused on adapting water management to climate change are rare charlton and arnell 2011 or at least are often not named as such moser and boykoff 2013 since strategies and investment plans are driven by many other short term concerns klein et al 2014 particularly in developing economies with competing developmental pressures therefore adaptation is often integrated into developmental plans for e g sietz et al 2011 significant deficiencies in climate preparedness do exist even in highly industrialised countries such as australia uk and usa preston et al 2010 which are often presumed to have higher capacity to deal with climate variability yet adaptation is especially relevant for developing countries which are struggling to address the challenges being posed by climate variability ford et al 2014 krysanova et al 2010 nyamwanza and kujinga 2016 compounded by other competing developmental priorities the limited research on adaptation mertz et al 2009 spires et al 2014 mostly focuses on vulnerable communities archer et al 2014 hammouri et al 2015 younus 2010 sectors dany et al 2015 marothia 2003 upgupta et al 2015 or physical systems such as river basins pandey et al 2011 sud et al 2015 but rarely on the organisations that administer water with a few exceptions including arnell and delaney 2006 engle 2012 tompkins et al 2010 this review paper aims to consolidate the state of the art in climate change adaptation for water management and identify the key knowledge gaps for successful implementation of adaptation strategies therefore this review paper brings together current literature on adaptation with the aim of identifying characteristics that enable or hinder adapting water management to climate change by water management organisations government agencies private companies municipal corporations non governmental organisations river basin management organisations or any agency that administers or supplies water to the users and or involved in water related disasters such as droughts and or floods it is divided into five sections section 1 has identified the need for consolidating the current knowledge on climate and argues the relevance of this review in the current discourse on climate change adaptation particularly for water management after the brief introduction to the aim and significance of the review in section 1 section 2 brings together the current knowledge on adaptation by water management organisations by drawing knowledge from adaptation studies in general the assessment of adaptive capacity and barriers and how adaptation is manifested in likely implementation of adaptation strategies this section also draws out the current discourse on how adaptation is understood and supplemented and exposes the lacunae in the current discourse this section exposes how adaptation is understood and the processes involved in adaptation implementation section 3 establishes the case for enabling adaptation and reducing barriers through inter organisational networks it thus brings together the current approaches towards enabling adaptation through a process identifying the known adaptation barriers and how they can be addressed finally section 4 draws the current gaps in knowledge before conclusions are drawn with key messages in section 5 section 4 thus points out to the need for addressing these key barriers in order to enable the successful implementation of adaptation actions this leads to the conclusion in section 5 which shows that adaptation involves the management of these barriers if adaptation is to be successful 2 adaptation by water management organisations organisations rarely remain static and virtually all undergo changes in their activities and processes for water management organisations these changes may be triggered by external factors such as water scarcity natural calamities legislation political reforms and technological change and or by internal factors such as change in leadership and management policy and innovation saleth et al 2000 since climate change is projected to increase water demand and reduce availability jiménez cisneros et al 2014 adaptation options in the water sector are generally categorised into supply side and demand side management arnell et al 2001 adaptation in the water sector needs to go beyond structural measures stakhiv 2011 and incorporate other measures including forecasting warning systems insurance instruments and other ways to improve efficiency of water use and related behavioural change through economic and fiscal instruments legislation and organisational change crabbé and robin 2006 therefore water management organisations themselves such as agencies and companies that are supplying water to the users for example need to adapt in order to avert and reduce undesirable impacts and take advantage of new opportunities approaching from organisational change theories berkhout 2012 distinguishes organisational adaptation into three perspectives a utility maximising b behavioural and c institutional such as legislation and formal and informal rules under the utility maximising approach organisations pursue adaptation if the cost of making the effort is less than the resulting benefits mendelsohn 2000 p 585 as the costs and benefits of alternatives and the costs of inaction need to be known utility maximising approaches cannot take into account the uncertain nature of climate impacts and issues of perception interpretation and the learning processes of organisational adaptation berkhout et al 2006 leading to mostly reactive adaptation berkhout 2012 berkhout 2012 p 93 arguing from the traditions of behavioural economics and organisational studies concurred that actors do not conform to the expected tenets of utility theory and instead use rules of thumb in responding to new situations and hence stressed the importance of perception and interpretation of potential risks moreover organisations are shaped by the constraints of external factors such as laws regulations and the socio cultural politico economic context in which they are embedded pahl wostl 2009 roggero 2015 as the recognition of the need for adaptation transitions into construction of adaptation strategies and plans mimura et al 2014 questions regarding whether or not the organisations managing the system have the capacity to adapt to the new and uncertain situations become even more urgent 2 1 assessment of adaptive capacity in the climate adaptation discourse adaptive capacity defined as the ability of systems institutions humans and other organisms to adjust to potential damage to take advantage of opportunities or to respond to consequences ipcc 2014b p 1758 of climate change is increasingly gaining research interest preston et al 2015 in the context of water management organisations it may be understood as the capacity of the organisation to maintain or improve levels of services despite climate and socio economic change adaptive capacity is therefore largely shaped by the capacity of decision makers within the organisation to grasp the potential challenge and the seriousness of the risks plan suitable strategies and implement them brown et al 2013 examples of various approaches of assessing adaptive capacity in the literature not specific to water management organisations can be categorised depending on the method of assessment scale and sector a method of assessment indicators gupta et al 2010 hinkel 2011 pandey et al 2011 participatory henly shepard et al 2014 munaretto et al 2014 smajgl 2010 scenario based dessai et al 2005 flörke et al 2011 pilli sihvola et al 2014 b scale of assessment individual households aulong et al 2012 community murtinho 2016 pearce et al 2012 whitehead 2009 younus 2010 local municipalities hogarth and wójcik 2016 shi et al 2015 regional juhola and kruse 2015 basin engle and lemos 2010 national clarvis and allan 2013 haddad 2005 multilevel pahl wostl 2009 westerhoff et al 2011 c sector of assessment water engle 2007 pandey et al 2011 forest brown et al 2010 building construction hertin et al 2003 the generic determinants of adaptive capacity in the above studies are similar to those proposed by smit et al 2001 although the selection of the indicators depends on the purpose scale or sector of each study it indicates that there is near consensus regarding the generic determinants of adaptive capacity which juhola and kruse 2015 differentiated into three dimensions of awareness ability and action table 1 in table 1 the availability of adaptive capacity determinants is indicated by the availability of various components in the third column despite the above consensus contentions exist when it comes to methods of evaluation and its applicability to policy making engle 2011 hinkel 2011 challenges of adaptive capacity evaluation pertains to its latent nature bohensky et al 2010 engle 2013 that it is contingent upon other economic and technological factors fitzsimons et al 2009 moench 2010 and its temporal dynamics moreover due to uncertainty in climate change projections and impacts adaptive capacity evaluation and application in policy making remain challenging hinkel 2011 2 2 attributes of adapting organisations since evaluation of adaptive capacity is challenging identifying the availability of adaptation attributes lonsdale et al 2010 wilby and vaughan 2011 and adaptation readiness ford and king 2015 has been adopted by some studies for evaluating adaptation by organisations wilby and vaughan 2011 and lonsdale et al 2010 identified adaptation attributes based on the existing characteristics of the organisations as organisations which are adapting to current climate variabilities are more likely to have greater adaptive capacity dessai and hulme 2004 attributes of adapting organisations are inherent within those organisations and organisations that aim to adapt need to acquire these attributes these attributes include a visionary leaders who can articulate adaptation goals and acquire resources b clearly stated adaptation objectives which are regularly reviewed c prioritised actions based on comprehensive risk and vulnerability assessments d implementable guidance and training to the operating staffs e flexible organisational structures that enable learning and decision making within the existing code of practice f adaptation pathways being guided by low regret adaptive measures g partnering with other organisations for resources pooling h monitoring and reporting progress against clearly defined targets and i effective communication internally and externally ford and king 2015 use similar criteria to capture the actions being done to plan and prepare for adaptation such as the existence of a political leadership for adaptation b institutional organisation for adaptation c decision making and stakeholder engagement d availability of usable science e funding and f public support for adaptation and applied to pilot studies to assess the adaptation readiness however the approach has similar challenges to evaluating adaptive capacity including data limitations and developing indices for evaluating readiness knowledge regarding how readiness factors actually drive adaptation action on the ground remains limited due to the nascent state of studies on actual manifestation of adaptation moser and boykoff 2013 just as the availability of adaptive capacity in itself does not ensure adaptation adaptation readiness does not mean that adaptation will automatically occur tilleard and ford 2016 therefore although the concept of adaptation readiness goes beyond adaptive capacity tilleard and ford 2016 it is insufficient to understand how adaptation will unfold particularly in the presence of adaptation barriers and limits 2 3 barriers to adaptation as climate change adaptation studies progress from impact assessment to policy and planning mimura et al 2014 to implementation challenges for successful adaptation are being discovered eisenack et al 2014 although organisations seldom remain static they also exhibit inertia in some aspects berkhout 2012 due to barriers which are both external and internal achieving the desired adaptation goals is contingent not on adaptive capacity alone but also upon many factors such as socio economic and cultural that shape decision makers perceptions of risks liu et al 2016 smith et al 2014 and their willingness to act adger et al 2009 gifford et al 2011 grothmann et al 2013 or prioritise actions with the increased recognition for the need to understand the factors and circumstances that stop delay or reduce adaptation effectiveness biesbroek et al 2014 barriers to adaptation have been defined from various perspectives with terms such as limits dow et al 2013a challenges fünfgeld 2010 obstacles bedsworth and hanak 2010 and constraints klein et al 2014 often being used synonymously however klein et al 2014 p 907 differentiated adaptation constraints from limits by defining the former as factors that make it harder to plan and implement adaptation actions and the latter following adger et al 2009 dow et al 2013 islam et al 2014 moser and ekstrom 2010 as the point at which an actor s objectives or system s needs cannot be secured from intolerable risks through adaptive actions klein et al 2014 p 907 a consensus is emerging among researchers to use limit to refer to natural and physical challenges whereas barrier more commonly refers to the challenges emerging from sociological and institutional factors barnett et al 2015 moser and ekstrom 2010 that can be overcome with concerted effort creative management change of thinking prioritization and related shifts in resources land uses institutions etc moser and ekstrom 2010 p 2 moser and ekstrom 2010 structured their conceptualisation of barriers according to three phases of adaptation understanding phase planning phase and management phase barriers at the understanding phase include the unavailability or inaccessibility of information and knowledge legitimacy credibility trust and receptivity to the information and willingness and ability to use it moser and ekstrom 2010 at the planning phase leadership roles regarding authority and the ability to identify risks and opportunities assess and devise alternative adaptation strategies and build consensus credibility and trust are essential traits of the governance system regarding control over the processes of policy making and resources allocation play an important role in determining outcomes in the planning phase berrang ford et al 2014 as actors perception of control can limit deliberations moser and ekstrom 2010 currently empirical understanding of barriers in the management phase are limited moser and boykoff 2013 due to the recentness of the climate change adaptation moser and ekstrom 2010 empirical studies that specifically focus on adaptation barriers are relatively recent biesbroek et al 2014 most studies to date have focused at the local level such as municipalities or local communities and rarely at the national level or across scales with clarvis and allan 2013 an exception the barriers reported from case studies mostly related to cognitive barriers such as the inability to understand the risks contextually jones and boyd 2011 shemdoe et al 2015 and make sense of adaptation alternatives or lack of information and data relevant to the scale of their influence amundsen et al 2010 baker et al 2012 pasquini et al 2013 assumptions of inability to change make some actors surrender to the situation jones and boyd 2011 while lack of local autonomy crabbé and robin 2006 and inaction by other organisations at a scale above the local bodies carlson and mccormick 2015 were also reported as critically hindering adaptation lack of trust clarvis and allan 2013 interest pasquini et al 2013 leadership measham et al 2011 climate scepticism baker et al 2012 engle 2012 and conflicts of interests pandey et al 2011 were also reported as adaptation barriers inadequate financial resources infrastructure focus on short term issues and competing developmental priorities engle 2012 and legislation issues such as unclear roles of actors amundsen et al 2010 and lack of consistent and clear policy guidelines from state and federal governments baker et al 2012 and cultural normative attitudes such as apathy and trust engle 2012 can also hinder or slow down adaptation this means it is difficult to ascertain or conclude that the mere availability of adaptive capacity will eventually lead to adaptation manifestation without addressing these adaptation barriers 2 4 adaptation manifestation adaptation manifestation can be understood as how successful adaptation will appear when barriers have been overcome and the desired goals of adaptation are met smit and wandel 2006 eliciting opinions from a range of experts doria et al 2009 p 815 defined successful adaptation as any adjustment that reduces the risks associated with climate change or vulnerability to climate change impacts to a predetermined level without compromising economic social and environmental sustainability doria et al 2009 however few empirical studies exist from which insights can be drawn to conclude that adaptation in water organisations such as those in the uk jude et al 2017 arnell and delaney 2006 was successful are few because adaptation planning rarely specify clear goals endpoints metrics or criteria for success moser and boykoff 2013 p 9 jude et al 2017 moreover the reports of adaptation being embedded within organisations are confined to industrialised countries berrang ford et al 2011 westerhoff et al 2011 jude et al 2017 and mostly to the water supply flood control and construction sectors tompkins et al 2010 adaptation being trickled down to the local organisations is scarcely evident and is mostly government driven tompkins et al 2010 manifestation of adaptation in developing countries where water is administered by government organisations with different legal authorities are poorly studied sud et al 2015 in many of the developing economies such as india water supplies flood control hydropower generation and inland navigation are controlled and operated by government organisations with limited local autonomy as compared to water companies in industrialised countries hence it is difficult to apply learning experiences from developed economies to the developing countries where competition for limited available resources continues to be a major challenge 3 enabling adaptation adaptation actions take place within a hierarchical structure of different organisational bodies operating at different levels that interact influence enable or hinder adaptation actions at another level adger et al 2005 lyle 2015 decision makers operating at different scales respond to the decisions made by actors at another scale smajgl and prananingtyas 2009 so that the capacity of organisations to adapt to the changing climate can be enhanced or undermined by the actions or inactions taken by actors beyond the organisation understanding the likelihood of an organisation adapting to the changing climate will involve understanding the influences from organisations operating at different scales or tiers of governance smajgl and prananingtyas 2009 this is particularly so in highly bureaucratic forms of governance where multiple organisations at multiple levels perform complimentary or overlapping functions azhoni et al 2017a recent studies on adaptation have shown that both public and non governmental organisations including research and academic organisations play a crucial role in enabling adaptation adekola 2012 agrawal 2010 frantzeskaki et al 2014 wang et al 2013 azhoni et al 2017b at multiple scales kirchhoff et al 2015 pahl wostl 2009 water management organisations therefore need to inter act with other agencies and sectors for adapting their management to climate change berkhout 2012 wilby and vaughan 2011 azhoni et al 2017b moreover when internal resources are limited organisations may need to acquire resources from beyond their operating scale to enhance their capacity vedeld et al 2015 azhoni et al 2017b managing water in changing climatic conditions compounded by growing demands due to other developmental pressures requires effective collaboration across scales and sectors to reduce competing policy agendas vedeld et al 2015 enhance efficient sharing of limited resources and increase learning experiences recognising the need for multi stakeholder and multi sectoral engagement in water management and climate change adaptation literature on inter organisational networks which was previously concentrated in the business and services sector is emerging adekola 2012 inderberg 2012 steinberg 2009 azhoni et al 2017a however the flows of knowledge and resources from higher levels of government through cross scale networks that shape the temporal dynamics of climate adaptation lyle 2015 azhoni et al 2017a are inadequately studied to understand how socially equitable and sustainable adaptation to climate change can be enhanced azhoni et al 2017b given that climate change impacts and adaptive capacity vary between sectors actors and regions grothmann et al 2013 prutsch et al 2014 local studies are required to draw out sociological perspectives on adaptation amaru and chhetri 2013 in order to complement national adaptation policies azhoni et al 2017b 3 1 devolution of adaptive capacity to organisations operating at different levels organisations operating at different levels from national to regional and local have both distinct and complementary roles in developing and implementing adaptation strategies adger et al 2005 fidelman et al 2013 nalau et al 2015 azhoni et al 2017b the extent of involvement of the various stakeholders in the design and application of adaptation measures shapes their outcome juhola and westerhoff 2011 azhoni et al 2017a this is particularly so for water management where adaptation can involve basin level management organisations regional and national governments and local municipal bodies bisaro et al 2010 finger et al 2006 lebel and garden 2008 mollinga et al 2006 pittock 2011 wilby and wood 2012 moreover this multi level organisational interaction is shaped by the governance and organisational structure bizikova et al 2015 dannevig and aall 2015 lyle 2015 mcgloughlin and sweeney 2011 schreurs 2010 vedeld et al 2015 azhoni et al 2017a however knowledge regarding how organisations operating at different levels operate and inter act with one another and how such interactions or the lack of create enabling mechanisms or hinder adaptation is limited amundsen et al 2010 dannevig and aall 2015 vedeld et al 2015 azhoni et al 2017a due to a lack of frameworks to understand these complex structures therefore more empirical studies are required to understand how the prevalence or absence of adapting attributes of organisations operating at one scale affects the adaptive capacity at another scale pahl wostl 2009 in various socio economic contexts azhoni et al 2017b 3 2 inter organisational networks for adaptation in theory networks are self organising collaborative non hierarchical flexible and topological and the conditions of possibility and actions of network participants are generally considered as a property emerging from the relationship with other participants rather than by their own inherent characteristic leitner and sheppard 2002 p 148 149 nonetheless networks are also not without hierarchy and a few members can dominate leading to political struggles and conflicts network theory analysis goes beyond socio political studies that look at individual organisations steinberg 2009 and includes the importance of non technical approaches to planning procedures lienert et al 2013 since climate change is a multi dimensional issue the need for a multi dimensional adaptation strategy by involving multiple stakeholders across scales can hardly be ignored studies regarding the importance of networks between municipal bodies fünfgeld 2015 experts rousselin 2015 non profit organisations steinberg 2009 and individuals for climate change adaptation dow et al 2013b aulong et al 2012 and sustainable management of resources baird et al 2015 bodin and crona 2009 are emerging the existence of networks enhances adaptive capacity brooks and adger 2005 enabling adaptation to take place through both formal organisations and networks across actors at various scales juhola and westerhoff 2011 tompkins et al 2010 networks allow organisations to cross organisational boundaries and blur formal categories providing a constellation of relationships that can be activated when needed can be perturbed for new information or ways of doing or simply turned to for an extensive store of knowledge lejano and ingram 2008 p 251 as the ability of a wider set of actors to plan adaptation is greatly enhanced by the presence of an effective network understanding stakeholder networks enables the key opportunities and barriers to the flow of specific information to be determined ziervogel and downing 2004 3 3 transboundary organisations in complex systems where multiple actors from various sectors are expected to be involved transboundary organisations organisations that transcend multiple boundaries sternlieb et al 2013 p 118 are increasingly recognised as playing a key role in enhancing adaptive capacity kalafatis et al 2015 kirchhoff et al 2015 van enst et al 2016 such organisations include boundary organisations that mediate between science and policy and act as organisational structures that make collaboration possible by engaging actors on the basis of their convergent interests sternlieb et al 2013 p 120 on the other hand bridging organisations connect the actions between the various types or groups of organisations mckenzie hedger et al 2006 gawith et al 2009 tompkins et al 2010 and act as conduits between social networks with the potential to link diverse nodes of expertise for collective action sternlieb et al 2013 p 121 and provide an arena for knowledge co production trust building sense making learning and horizontal collaboration and conflict resolution berkes 2009 p 1695 likewise brown et al 2013 and loorbach and rotmans 2010 highlight the crucial role of bridging organisations and change agents in enabling sustainability transition as the same organisation can mediate between science and policy as well as between organisations operating at different scales vertically or between different types of organisations or groups of organisations the terms are sometimes used interchangeably 4 discussion the literature surveyed has identified the inter relationships regarding knowledge concerning a climate change impacts and adaptation needs section 1 b factors that enable adaptation section 3 c factors that hinders adaptation barriers section 2 3 and d adaptation manifestation section 2 4 which are synthesised in fig 1 thus fig 1 brings together the various strands of climate change adaptation reviewed in the previous sections for example assessment of the potential impacts of climate change manifesting through the reduced availability and reduced quality of water and increase in demands and increased floods risks discussed in section 1 provides the information and knowledge required for enabling adaptation planning section 2 2 besides the availability of information and knowledge the literature surveyed thus far pointed out that other resources such as technology infrastructure finances and conducive institutional mechanisms highlighted in part b of fig 1 and elaborated in sections 2 1 and 2 2 are necessary for enabling adaptation however in spite of the availability of adaptation enabling factors elaborated in sections 2 1 and 2 2 and highlighted in part b of fig 1 certain factors such as a cultural and normative behaviour b cognitive barriers c rigid and outdated laws d bureaucratic procedures and e uncertainty in climate change projections and limited resourcescan hinder adaptation these are collectively termed barriers and highlighted in part c of fig 1 and section 2 3 evidently it emerged from the literature surveyed that transboundary organisations section 3 3 which bridge the gaps between various sectors and actors and inter organisational networks sections 3 2 play a crucial role in overcoming some of the barriers elaborated in section 2 3 this is highlighted in part c of fig 1 by suggesting that transboundary organisations and inter organisational networks represent two pillars of adaptation all these factors are not necessarily sequential or hierarchical and can occur simultaneously klein et al 2014 however manifestation of adaptation highlighted by part d of fig 1 and elaborated in section 2 4 is influenced by the above mentioned factors for example water management organisations that possess a enhanced knowledge b has planned measurable targets c guided by implementable goals e for low regret anticipatory measures f led by visionary leaders that g monitors its actions and iterates its implementation are successful in adaptation this is highlighted by part d of fig 1 the overall aim of adaptation is of course to reduce risks and vulnerability and maintain or improve the economic social and environmental sustainability these various strands of adaptation are further discussed in the following subsections to highlight existing information and understanding and identify knowledge gaps since the impacts of climate change will be experienced mainly through the medium of water water organisations need to build adaptive capacity however adaptive capacity and adaptation barriers are closely related with for example the lack of adaptive capacity components such as knowledge economic and infrastructural resources and inadequate organisational mechanisms becoming barriers fig 1 part b c on the other hand the availability of adaptive capacity in itself does not ensure the absence of adaptation barriers instead the effective utilisation of adaptive capacity is reduced by barriers oberlack 2016 such as cultural and normative behaviours rigid and outdated laws and bureaucratic procedures and inaccessibility to information among others adaptive capacity is utilised in an organisational context which is itself shaped by existing laws and implemented via a normative procedure although what is normative is questionable in addition the inherent uncertainty of climate change affects utilisation of adaptive capacity such as when and where to apply financial and human resources however elements of adaptive capacity such as the existence of a flexible organisational mechanisms can overcome the challenges of uncertainty dessai and hulme 2009 inter organisational networks enable decision makers and actors to acquire additional adaptive capacity from beyond the organisation baird et al 2015 bodin and crona 2009 to overcome barriers and thus enable the translation of adaptive capacity into adaptation manifestation the role of transboundary organisations sternlieb et al 2013 in these networks is particularly important both for enhancing the adaptive capacity berkes 2009 and also for reducing the adaptation barriers oberlack 2016 current literature regarding the relationship between a adaptation enabling characteristics b adaptation barriers and c manifestation of adaptation is fragmented fig 1 above synthesises and illustrates the relationship between these three components for understanding adaptation the fig 1 above outlines the various components of climate change adaptation and is not an indication of the process of adaptation because adaptation is iterative based on the experiences and information gained over time as highlighted in section 1 the impacts of climate change are mostly manifested through the medium of water reducing its availability increasing demand and flood risks and also affecting the quality of the available water information and knowledge regarding these impacts are necessary for creating awareness among policy and decision makers the availability of technology infrastructure resources and organisational mechanisms enhances the adaptive capacity however availability of these determinants of adaptive capacity alone are insufficient to ensure successful adaptation agency related factors such as the cultural and normative behaviours of the agents the organisational contexts in which the organisation operates such as rigid and outdated laws and lengthy bureaucratic processes and inherent characteristics of climate change such as uncertainty and other bio physical features can hinder the effective utilization of available adaptive capacity literature surveyed in section 3 2 and 3 3 indicates the important role of inter organisational networks and transboundary organisations in enhancing adaptive capacity as well as overcoming barriers finally the visible characteristics of a well adapting organisation are listed in the fourth component of the diagram in fig 1 the remaining part of this section draws out the key knowledge gaps based on the literature surveyed and discusses its implications 4 1 adaptation by organisations evaluations of adaptive capacity particularly in developing economies focus on communities but not on the organisations that administer water the most important element in adapting water management to climate change the water management organisations is often ignored in the literature particularly in studies of developing economies it may be implicitly assumed that organisations which administer water for public good will adapt if the society or the sector as a whole adapts to the changing climate however organisations and agencies that are administering the ecological and societal needs of water will have to lead in adapting to the changes whilst research on adaptive capacity for example pandey et al 2011 is emerging in the context of developing economies mertz et al 2009 most studies focus on communities or the vulnerability of physical systems and rarely on the capacity of organisations which are expected to enable society and ecology to adapt to the climate nevertheless some key lessons on the characteristics of adaptation can be drawn from some of these studies climate change adaptation consists of levels of actions to be undertaken by individuals for their own benefit or by the government organisations to protect its citizens adger et al 2005 and often it requires collaboration between the two wamsler 2016 for instance adaptation actions by farmers can be seen as individual adaptation while adaptation in water management will be a mix of private and public mendelsohn 2006 wamsler 2016 conjectured that public adaptation can support or obstruct individual adaptations adaptations oriented towards conservation of the environment are public and as it becomes more public it becomes more complex huitema et al 2016 these actions take place within a hierarchical structure of different organisational bodies operating at different levels that interact influence enable or hinders the adaptation actions at another level adger et al 2005 lyle 2015 the adaptation process arnell and delaney 2006 berkhout 2012 grothmann and patt 2005 by organisations involves a perception b evaluation c enactment and d feedback which are not necessarily sequential but interactive and often reinforcing or constraining one another klein et al 2014 decision makers do not necessarily respond based on the true level of risk inherent in the changing climate and it may be not possible to determine the level of risks accurately in many instances due to the uncertainties in climate change but adaptation strategies are planned based on the perceived risks burch and robinson 2007 which may be shaped by extreme weather events engle 2013 potential threats halady and rao 2010 marshall et al 2013 and socio cultural contexts mauelshagen 2012 therefore understanding how key actors within water management organisations perceive risks is essential brown et al 2013 smith et al 2014 for evaluating the ability and likelihood of the organisation to adapt to the changing climate evaluation of the adaptation options depends largely on the available economic technological and human resources available besides political and cultural factors and may be evaluated differently by different actors arnell 2011 it also is shaped by the cognitive capacity of decision makers grothmann et al 2013 to articulate the resources requirement porter et al 2015 on other hand organisations or actors can also maladapt and thereby create unintentional and unforeseen vulnerabilities adger and barnett 2009 juhola et al 2016 kiparsky et al 2012 juhola et al 2016 p 139 defined maladaptation as a result of an intentional adaptation policy or measure directly increasing vulnerability for the targeted and or external actor s and or eroding preconditions for sustainable development by indirectly increasing society s vulnerability since adaptation is an iterative process implementing the adaptation strategies and experiences gained through such implementations are important for improving future adaptation strategies berkhout 2012 understanding whether or not the water management organisations can reduce the likely impacts and or take advantage of the new opportunities clearly becomes an important concern 4 2 adaptive capacity limitations evaluation of adaptive capacity and its application for policy making remains contested due to its latent dynamic and contextual nature although consensus on the determinants of adaptive capacity is growing its evaluation and application for policy making is contested the generic determinants of adaptive capacity of smit et al 2001 continue to be the assessment framework in different contexts sectors and scales of assessments however disagreements remain regarding the methods of data collection assessments and criteria to be used for measurement of adaptive capacity engle 2011 hinkel 2011 due to the diverse and context dependent nature of climate change vulnerability and risks evaluation of adaptive capacity is challenging because of its latent and context specific nature and the influential role of dynamic variables juhola and kruse 2015 determinants of adaptive capacity are difficult to generalise and do not carry equal weight between contexts engle 2011 pandey et al 2011 methods of adaptive capacity evaluation using aggregated indices gupta et al 2010 pandey et al 2011 have been found to be of limited use due to the difference in context and subjectivity since adaptation to climate change is variable rich multidimensional and perhaps chaotic a single approach is unlikely to understand different challenges biesbroek et al 2013 rigorous conceptual frameworks for evaluating the adaptive capacity of organisations are lacking as there remains contentions regarding the usefulness transparency and objectivity of adaptive capacity indicators hinkel 2011 not only are the methods of evaluating adaptive capacity contested but their applicability to policy making remains controversial particularly the use of quantitative indicators hinkel 2011 in addition limiting analysis to determinants of adaptive capacity ignores other key factors such as adaptation barriers and is inadequate to understand why the availability of adaptive capacity is not an assurance that adaptation will occur burch and robinson 2007 since the availability of adaptive capacity in itself does not guarantee that adaptation will occur research needs to progress to understanding how existing adaptive capacity can be utilised successfully and enhanced this will require the factors such as attitudes of actors inherent uncertainty of climate change and organisational challenges such as rigid and outdated processes of decision making that contribute to the barriers to the utilization of adaptive capacity moser and boykoff 2013 to be understood and overcome to transform adaptive capacity into adaptation manifestation 4 3 adaptation manifestations are limitedly visible the limited studies on the manifestation of adaptation are confined to industrialised countries and unlikely to have huge relevance for water management organisations in developing economies where public organisations administer water in spite of the growing efforts on adaptation examples or empirical studies that demonstrate how water management organisations have actually adapted to the impacts of climate change are limited arnell 2010 mimura et al 2014 especially in developing countries sud et al 2015 those reported e g gawith et al 2009 jude et al 2017 tompkins et al 2010 are isolated and unlikely to be directly applicable to developing economies where the socio cultural and economic contexts in addition to institutional regulations and legislations of how water is governed and administered are different moreover as adaptation depends on risk perceptions and availability of resources and technology socio economic and cultural factors are likely to play a key role in how water organisations respond to similar or different impacts azhoni et al 2017b a challenge for climate change adaptation is to use an understanding of the drivers of past adaptation efforts to support its mainstreaming into other general developmental praxis mertz et al 2009 4 4 need for identification of context to barriers few studies take into account the socio cultural and economic contexts of adaptation barriers and whilst their root causes and inter relationships are poorly understood the best top down national or regional plans do not necessarily translate into successful adaptation preston et al 2010 as adaptation is context specific and contingent upon factors including aptitude and attitude of implementing agencies towards risks wilby and vaughan 2011 political and circumstantial priorities haddad 2005 and the availability of resources and technology moser and ekstrom 2010 propose that working through barriers rather than skipping entire phases of the decision process will prove beneficial for the decision outcome therefore exposing the factors that stop divert or delay organisations to effectively adapt are crucial in the adaptation process berkhout 2012 superficially adaptive capacity and adaptation barriers appear as the mirror image of one another the absence of adaptive capacity is a barrier although the absence of certain determinants of adaptive capacity such as information and resources lead to barriers their presence does not ensure that adaptation will occur moser and boykoff 2013 therefore determinants of both adaptive capacity and barriers have to be taken into context although not necessarily as separate entities adaptation planning will require the identification of adaptation barriers and an understanding of the factors that control their emergence and sustenance eisenack et al 2014 due to the contextual nature of barriers azhoni et al 2017b eisenack et al 2014 and their dependence on actors baker et al 2012 engle 2012 defining and conceptualising the local causes of barriers remains challenging although there is a growing interest in adaptation barriers in general research on barriers for organisations to adapt is limited biesbroek et al 2013 with few studies addressing the causes of barriers and the interdependences between them azhoni et al 2017b eisenack et al 2014 moreover knowledge on barriers to adaptation in developing economies remains scattered and barriers emerging from political social and psychological factors are rarely mentioned shackleton et al 2015 this is largely due to a lack of frameworks to understand the barriers biesbroek et al 2013 as it is contingent upon the societal values o brien 2009 and attitudes towards risks adger et al 2009 besides the physical and natural circumstances adger et al 2009 contend that issues of values and ethics attitudes to risks knowledge and culture construct the context of adaptation and hence barriers are mutable therefore research on why barriers emerge and their interactions and compounded impacts that shape adaptation processes are urgently required shackleton et al 2015 4 5 role of inter organisational networks inter organisational networks particularly within public organisations and between governmental and non governmental organisations are poorly understood increasing the adaptive capacity beyond the inherent capacity within an organisation requires acquisition of capacity from other organisations which can be supported by transboundary organisations inter organisational networks can exist vertically between organisations operating at different scales azhoni et al 2017a such as the national scale or more locally or horizontally between organisations in various sectors azhoni et al 2017b as networks are expected to be self organised and not externally imposed leitner and sheppard 2002 the presence of a strong network among organisations can provide an opportunity for them to gather resources through the network even when the particular organisation does not possess the required resource to face the challenge ziervogel and downing 2004 since effective networks enhance smooth adaptation lejano and ingram 2008 networking barriers become barriers for adaptation azhoni et al 2017b burch 2010 vedeld et al 2015 although inter organisational networks between non profit organisations have been shown to enhance adaptive capacity by creating an ecosystem of organisations through sharing of knowledge and information steinberg 2009 networks among public organisations remain unexplored public government organisations tend to work in silos and not much attention has been given to how effectively services can be delivered through improved coordination azhoni et al 2017a organisations are more complex than individuals pahl wostl 2009 so that social network theories of individuals cannot be directly applied moreover the existence of social networks in themselves cannot be assumed to enhance the adaptive capacity of an organisation brockhaus et al 2012 if the network is exclusive and rigid leaves conventional wisdom unchallenged and does not enable learning newman and dale 2007 4 6 transboundary organisations and their role in enabling adaptation the role of transboundary organisations in enhancing the adaptive capacity of water organisations is poorly understood and hence underappreciated the role played by transboundary organisations in supporting organisations to adapt needs to be recognised and supported griggs and kestin 2011 mastrandrea et al 2010 mckenzie hedger et al 2006 tompkins et al 2010 such transboundary organisations enhance adaptive capacity by bridging the gap between researchers and policy and decision makers through providing or enabling them to acquire the necessary resources or to create a system conducive for adaptation eisenack and stecker 2012 additionally transboundary organisations can play the crucial role of advocacy that provides a stimulus towards adaptation and change actions such as the development of adaptation techniques building knowledge capacity and developing knowledge regarding vulnerable systems to support decision makers to take adaptation measures which are considered as adaptation facilitation can be enhanced by transboundary organisations the role of such organisations in developing economies is inadequately assessed and hence is poorly appreciated 5 conclusions the importance of adaptation particularly for water management is widely recognised gaining a consensus regarding generalised methods of adaptive capacity evaluation and application to policy is unlikely because of its latent dynamic and contextual nature even though its determinants are more or less recognised therefore studies focusing on the existence of adaptation attributes and adaptation readiness particularly using qualitative approaches to capture the contextual nuances are emerging primarily from industrialised countries but are unlikely to have huge relevance for developing economies where climate adaptation has to compete with other developmental priorities the need for adaptation at all scales taking into consideration both top down and bottom up perspectives is widely emphasized in literature however the flows of knowledge and resources from higher levels of government through cross scale networks that shape the temporal dynamics of climate adaptation are inadequately studied to understand how socially equitable and sustainable adaptation to climate change can be enhanced given that climate change impacts and adaptive capacity vary between sectors actors and regions local studies are required to draw out contextual perspectives on adaptation in order to complement national adaptation policies in this regard transboundary organisations that operate across scales and sectors have the potential to enhance the adaptive capacity of water organisations this can be complemented by improving inter organisational networks because social networks among actors can be key to acquiring adaptive capacity from beyond the organisation organisations are more complex than individuals and hence social network theories of individuals cannot be directly applied and hence network theories should be applied cautiously further the existence of social networks in themselves cannot be assumed to enhance the adaptive capacity of an organisation if the network is exclusive and rigid leaving conventional wisdom unchallenged and preventing learning as such understanding the factors that hinder inter organisational cooperation by taking into account specific contextual socio economic and political factors will support identifying and overcoming adaptation barriers in spite of the growing initiatives on climate change adaptation defining successful adaptation and discerning the relationships between intentions strategies actions and outcomes remain a challenge adaptation tracking is particularly challenging due to inconsistencies regarding what actually counts as adaptation actions and what counts as adaptation preparation models of successful adaptation for water management are limited due to the inter sectoral nature of water management inherent uncertainties in climate change scale issues and the continuous ongoing nature of adaptation since adaptation is a continuous process as new challenges emerge questions of what actually counts as successful adaptation remains the literature reviewed here provides rich insights into understanding adaptation enabling characteristics and barriers however the existing studies are inadequate to draw conclusions on the inter relationship between adaptive capacity adaptation barriers and manifestation of adaptation attributes the relationship between the various determinants of adaptive capacity and the various types of barriers and how they emerge and are sustained is inadequately evidenced by empirical studies as issues of values and ethics attitudes to risks knowledge and culture construct the context of adaptation research on why barriers emerge and their interactions and compounded impacts that shape adaptation processes are urgently required addressing these knowledge gaps will help to improve the designing of adaptation strategies thereby improving the ability of water organisations to address the ongoing challenges of climate change acknowledgements we acknowledge the government of india grant no 11016 10 2010 and the uk natural environment research council grant number ne 1022329 1 for sponsoring this research no

7415,climate change will be particularly experienced though the medium of water water organisations that are managing societal and ecological needs for water are therefore likely to experience the impact the most this study reviews the current literature regarding adaptation to climate change by water management organisations and associated barriers literature on adaptive capacity is growing and a general consensus is emerging on the determinants of adaptive capacity although variations exist regarding how it is to be evaluated enhanced and applied to policy making due to its dynamic contextual and latent nature since adaptive capacity is hard to measure and successful adaptation difficult to define some studies focus on the existence of adaptation attributes of organisations studies reporting successful adaptation are minimal and barriers of adaptation are being discovered as adaptation research transitions into implementation but the root causes of these barriers are often overlooked and the interconnectedness of the barriers is poorly addressed increasingly combining top down and bottom up approaches to adaptation is being recommended due to the limitations of each however knowledge regarding how organisations operating at different scales can enhance adaptive capacity of other organisations operating at another scale is lacking due to the few studies of inter organisational networks across scales social networks among actors are recognised as a key factor to enable adaptation however network studies generally focus on individual actors and rarely between public agencies organisations moreover the current literature is inadequate to understand the relationship between adaptation enabling characteristics barriers and adaptation manifestation the review demonstrates that research on understanding the emergence and sustenance of barriers is urgently required addressing these knowledge gaps will help to improve the design of adaptation strategies thereby improving the ability of water management to address the ongoing challenges of climate change keywords adaptation adaptive capacity barriers climate change inter organisational networks water management organisations 1 introduction changes in recent climate and associated impacts on natural and human systems have been reported widely ipcc 2014a these include changing precipitation and snow melt altering water resources arnell 2004 kundzewicz et al 2008 and hydro geo logical behaviour holman 2006 leading to floods and droughts barnett et al 2005 jaswal et al 2015 rajeevan et al 2008 singh et al 2016 upgupta et al 2015 xu et al 2009 climate change is also likely to impact water quality whitehead et al 2009 including increased sediment loads during floods wulf et al 2012 and increased contaminant concentration during the dry season whitehead et al 2009 temperature increases are likely to increase water demand holman 2006 particularly in irrigation wang et al 2014 due to increased evapotranspiration in short the immediate and direct impacts of climate change are going to be particularly experienced through the medium of water the compelling and growing body of evidence of a changing climate points to the urgent need for adaptation actions to compliment mitigation füssel 2007 simonet and fatorić 2015 due to the emissions already committed ipcc 2007 and the inadequacy of international agreements for reducing greenhouse emissions spash 2016 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014b p 1758 defined adaptation as the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects within human systems adaptation is aimed at moderating or alleviating harmful effects or to take advantage of the beneficial opportunities noble et al 2014 through anticipatory autonomous and or planned actions mimura et al 2014 preston et al 2013 however actions solely focused on adapting water management to climate change are rare charlton and arnell 2011 or at least are often not named as such moser and boykoff 2013 since strategies and investment plans are driven by many other short term concerns klein et al 2014 particularly in developing economies with competing developmental pressures therefore adaptation is often integrated into developmental plans for e g sietz et al 2011 significant deficiencies in climate preparedness do exist even in highly industrialised countries such as australia uk and usa preston et al 2010 which are often presumed to have higher capacity to deal with climate variability yet adaptation is especially relevant for developing countries which are struggling to address the challenges being posed by climate variability ford et al 2014 krysanova et al 2010 nyamwanza and kujinga 2016 compounded by other competing developmental priorities the limited research on adaptation mertz et al 2009 spires et al 2014 mostly focuses on vulnerable communities archer et al 2014 hammouri et al 2015 younus 2010 sectors dany et al 2015 marothia 2003 upgupta et al 2015 or physical systems such as river basins pandey et al 2011 sud et al 2015 but rarely on the organisations that administer water with a few exceptions including arnell and delaney 2006 engle 2012 tompkins et al 2010 this review paper aims to consolidate the state of the art in climate change adaptation for water management and identify the key knowledge gaps for successful implementation of adaptation strategies therefore this review paper brings together current literature on adaptation with the aim of identifying characteristics that enable or hinder adapting water management to climate change by water management organisations government agencies private companies municipal corporations non governmental organisations river basin management organisations or any agency that administers or supplies water to the users and or involved in water related disasters such as droughts and or floods it is divided into five sections section 1 has identified the need for consolidating the current knowledge on climate and argues the relevance of this review in the current discourse on climate change adaptation particularly for water management after the brief introduction to the aim and significance of the review in section 1 section 2 brings together the current knowledge on adaptation by water management organisations by drawing knowledge from adaptation studies in general the assessment of adaptive capacity and barriers and how adaptation is manifested in likely implementation of adaptation strategies this section also draws out the current discourse on how adaptation is understood and supplemented and exposes the lacunae in the current discourse this section exposes how adaptation is understood and the processes involved in adaptation implementation section 3 establishes the case for enabling adaptation and reducing barriers through inter organisational networks it thus brings together the current approaches towards enabling adaptation through a process identifying the known adaptation barriers and how they can be addressed finally section 4 draws the current gaps in knowledge before conclusions are drawn with key messages in section 5 section 4 thus points out to the need for addressing these key barriers in order to enable the successful implementation of adaptation actions this leads to the conclusion in section 5 which shows that adaptation involves the management of these barriers if adaptation is to be successful 2 adaptation by water management organisations organisations rarely remain static and virtually all undergo changes in their activities and processes for water management organisations these changes may be triggered by external factors such as water scarcity natural calamities legislation political reforms and technological change and or by internal factors such as change in leadership and management policy and innovation saleth et al 2000 since climate change is projected to increase water demand and reduce availability jiménez cisneros et al 2014 adaptation options in the water sector are generally categorised into supply side and demand side management arnell et al 2001 adaptation in the water sector needs to go beyond structural measures stakhiv 2011 and incorporate other measures including forecasting warning systems insurance instruments and other ways to improve efficiency of water use and related behavioural change through economic and fiscal instruments legislation and organisational change crabbé and robin 2006 therefore water management organisations themselves such as agencies and companies that are supplying water to the users for example need to adapt in order to avert and reduce undesirable impacts and take advantage of new opportunities approaching from organisational change theories berkhout 2012 distinguishes organisational adaptation into three perspectives a utility maximising b behavioural and c institutional such as legislation and formal and informal rules under the utility maximising approach organisations pursue adaptation if the cost of making the effort is less than the resulting benefits mendelsohn 2000 p 585 as the costs and benefits of alternatives and the costs of inaction need to be known utility maximising approaches cannot take into account the uncertain nature of climate impacts and issues of perception interpretation and the learning processes of organisational adaptation berkhout et al 2006 leading to mostly reactive adaptation berkhout 2012 berkhout 2012 p 93 arguing from the traditions of behavioural economics and organisational studies concurred that actors do not conform to the expected tenets of utility theory and instead use rules of thumb in responding to new situations and hence stressed the importance of perception and interpretation of potential risks moreover organisations are shaped by the constraints of external factors such as laws regulations and the socio cultural politico economic context in which they are embedded pahl wostl 2009 roggero 2015 as the recognition of the need for adaptation transitions into construction of adaptation strategies and plans mimura et al 2014 questions regarding whether or not the organisations managing the system have the capacity to adapt to the new and uncertain situations become even more urgent 2 1 assessment of adaptive capacity in the climate adaptation discourse adaptive capacity defined as the ability of systems institutions humans and other organisms to adjust to potential damage to take advantage of opportunities or to respond to consequences ipcc 2014b p 1758 of climate change is increasingly gaining research interest preston et al 2015 in the context of water management organisations it may be understood as the capacity of the organisation to maintain or improve levels of services despite climate and socio economic change adaptive capacity is therefore largely shaped by the capacity of decision makers within the organisation to grasp the potential challenge and the seriousness of the risks plan suitable strategies and implement them brown et al 2013 examples of various approaches of assessing adaptive capacity in the literature not specific to water management organisations can be categorised depending on the method of assessment scale and sector a method of assessment indicators gupta et al 2010 hinkel 2011 pandey et al 2011 participatory henly shepard et al 2014 munaretto et al 2014 smajgl 2010 scenario based dessai et al 2005 flörke et al 2011 pilli sihvola et al 2014 b scale of assessment individual households aulong et al 2012 community murtinho 2016 pearce et al 2012 whitehead 2009 younus 2010 local municipalities hogarth and wójcik 2016 shi et al 2015 regional juhola and kruse 2015 basin engle and lemos 2010 national clarvis and allan 2013 haddad 2005 multilevel pahl wostl 2009 westerhoff et al 2011 c sector of assessment water engle 2007 pandey et al 2011 forest brown et al 2010 building construction hertin et al 2003 the generic determinants of adaptive capacity in the above studies are similar to those proposed by smit et al 2001 although the selection of the indicators depends on the purpose scale or sector of each study it indicates that there is near consensus regarding the generic determinants of adaptive capacity which juhola and kruse 2015 differentiated into three dimensions of awareness ability and action table 1 in table 1 the availability of adaptive capacity determinants is indicated by the availability of various components in the third column despite the above consensus contentions exist when it comes to methods of evaluation and its applicability to policy making engle 2011 hinkel 2011 challenges of adaptive capacity evaluation pertains to its latent nature bohensky et al 2010 engle 2013 that it is contingent upon other economic and technological factors fitzsimons et al 2009 moench 2010 and its temporal dynamics moreover due to uncertainty in climate change projections and impacts adaptive capacity evaluation and application in policy making remain challenging hinkel 2011 2 2 attributes of adapting organisations since evaluation of adaptive capacity is challenging identifying the availability of adaptation attributes lonsdale et al 2010 wilby and vaughan 2011 and adaptation readiness ford and king 2015 has been adopted by some studies for evaluating adaptation by organisations wilby and vaughan 2011 and lonsdale et al 2010 identified adaptation attributes based on the existing characteristics of the organisations as organisations which are adapting to current climate variabilities are more likely to have greater adaptive capacity dessai and hulme 2004 attributes of adapting organisations are inherent within those organisations and organisations that aim to adapt need to acquire these attributes these attributes include a visionary leaders who can articulate adaptation goals and acquire resources b clearly stated adaptation objectives which are regularly reviewed c prioritised actions based on comprehensive risk and vulnerability assessments d implementable guidance and training to the operating staffs e flexible organisational structures that enable learning and decision making within the existing code of practice f adaptation pathways being guided by low regret adaptive measures g partnering with other organisations for resources pooling h monitoring and reporting progress against clearly defined targets and i effective communication internally and externally ford and king 2015 use similar criteria to capture the actions being done to plan and prepare for adaptation such as the existence of a political leadership for adaptation b institutional organisation for adaptation c decision making and stakeholder engagement d availability of usable science e funding and f public support for adaptation and applied to pilot studies to assess the adaptation readiness however the approach has similar challenges to evaluating adaptive capacity including data limitations and developing indices for evaluating readiness knowledge regarding how readiness factors actually drive adaptation action on the ground remains limited due to the nascent state of studies on actual manifestation of adaptation moser and boykoff 2013 just as the availability of adaptive capacity in itself does not ensure adaptation adaptation readiness does not mean that adaptation will automatically occur tilleard and ford 2016 therefore although the concept of adaptation readiness goes beyond adaptive capacity tilleard and ford 2016 it is insufficient to understand how adaptation will unfold particularly in the presence of adaptation barriers and limits 2 3 barriers to adaptation as climate change adaptation studies progress from impact assessment to policy and planning mimura et al 2014 to implementation challenges for successful adaptation are being discovered eisenack et al 2014 although organisations seldom remain static they also exhibit inertia in some aspects berkhout 2012 due to barriers which are both external and internal achieving the desired adaptation goals is contingent not on adaptive capacity alone but also upon many factors such as socio economic and cultural that shape decision makers perceptions of risks liu et al 2016 smith et al 2014 and their willingness to act adger et al 2009 gifford et al 2011 grothmann et al 2013 or prioritise actions with the increased recognition for the need to understand the factors and circumstances that stop delay or reduce adaptation effectiveness biesbroek et al 2014 barriers to adaptation have been defined from various perspectives with terms such as limits dow et al 2013a challenges fünfgeld 2010 obstacles bedsworth and hanak 2010 and constraints klein et al 2014 often being used synonymously however klein et al 2014 p 907 differentiated adaptation constraints from limits by defining the former as factors that make it harder to plan and implement adaptation actions and the latter following adger et al 2009 dow et al 2013 islam et al 2014 moser and ekstrom 2010 as the point at which an actor s objectives or system s needs cannot be secured from intolerable risks through adaptive actions klein et al 2014 p 907 a consensus is emerging among researchers to use limit to refer to natural and physical challenges whereas barrier more commonly refers to the challenges emerging from sociological and institutional factors barnett et al 2015 moser and ekstrom 2010 that can be overcome with concerted effort creative management change of thinking prioritization and related shifts in resources land uses institutions etc moser and ekstrom 2010 p 2 moser and ekstrom 2010 structured their conceptualisation of barriers according to three phases of adaptation understanding phase planning phase and management phase barriers at the understanding phase include the unavailability or inaccessibility of information and knowledge legitimacy credibility trust and receptivity to the information and willingness and ability to use it moser and ekstrom 2010 at the planning phase leadership roles regarding authority and the ability to identify risks and opportunities assess and devise alternative adaptation strategies and build consensus credibility and trust are essential traits of the governance system regarding control over the processes of policy making and resources allocation play an important role in determining outcomes in the planning phase berrang ford et al 2014 as actors perception of control can limit deliberations moser and ekstrom 2010 currently empirical understanding of barriers in the management phase are limited moser and boykoff 2013 due to the recentness of the climate change adaptation moser and ekstrom 2010 empirical studies that specifically focus on adaptation barriers are relatively recent biesbroek et al 2014 most studies to date have focused at the local level such as municipalities or local communities and rarely at the national level or across scales with clarvis and allan 2013 an exception the barriers reported from case studies mostly related to cognitive barriers such as the inability to understand the risks contextually jones and boyd 2011 shemdoe et al 2015 and make sense of adaptation alternatives or lack of information and data relevant to the scale of their influence amundsen et al 2010 baker et al 2012 pasquini et al 2013 assumptions of inability to change make some actors surrender to the situation jones and boyd 2011 while lack of local autonomy crabbé and robin 2006 and inaction by other organisations at a scale above the local bodies carlson and mccormick 2015 were also reported as critically hindering adaptation lack of trust clarvis and allan 2013 interest pasquini et al 2013 leadership measham et al 2011 climate scepticism baker et al 2012 engle 2012 and conflicts of interests pandey et al 2011 were also reported as adaptation barriers inadequate financial resources infrastructure focus on short term issues and competing developmental priorities engle 2012 and legislation issues such as unclear roles of actors amundsen et al 2010 and lack of consistent and clear policy guidelines from state and federal governments baker et al 2012 and cultural normative attitudes such as apathy and trust engle 2012 can also hinder or slow down adaptation this means it is difficult to ascertain or conclude that the mere availability of adaptive capacity will eventually lead to adaptation manifestation without addressing these adaptation barriers 2 4 adaptation manifestation adaptation manifestation can be understood as how successful adaptation will appear when barriers have been overcome and the desired goals of adaptation are met smit and wandel 2006 eliciting opinions from a range of experts doria et al 2009 p 815 defined successful adaptation as any adjustment that reduces the risks associated with climate change or vulnerability to climate change impacts to a predetermined level without compromising economic social and environmental sustainability doria et al 2009 however few empirical studies exist from which insights can be drawn to conclude that adaptation in water organisations such as those in the uk jude et al 2017 arnell and delaney 2006 was successful are few because adaptation planning rarely specify clear goals endpoints metrics or criteria for success moser and boykoff 2013 p 9 jude et al 2017 moreover the reports of adaptation being embedded within organisations are confined to industrialised countries berrang ford et al 2011 westerhoff et al 2011 jude et al 2017 and mostly to the water supply flood control and construction sectors tompkins et al 2010 adaptation being trickled down to the local organisations is scarcely evident and is mostly government driven tompkins et al 2010 manifestation of adaptation in developing countries where water is administered by government organisations with different legal authorities are poorly studied sud et al 2015 in many of the developing economies such as india water supplies flood control hydropower generation and inland navigation are controlled and operated by government organisations with limited local autonomy as compared to water companies in industrialised countries hence it is difficult to apply learning experiences from developed economies to the developing countries where competition for limited available resources continues to be a major challenge 3 enabling adaptation adaptation actions take place within a hierarchical structure of different organisational bodies operating at different levels that interact influence enable or hinder adaptation actions at another level adger et al 2005 lyle 2015 decision makers operating at different scales respond to the decisions made by actors at another scale smajgl and prananingtyas 2009 so that the capacity of organisations to adapt to the changing climate can be enhanced or undermined by the actions or inactions taken by actors beyond the organisation understanding the likelihood of an organisation adapting to the changing climate will involve understanding the influences from organisations operating at different scales or tiers of governance smajgl and prananingtyas 2009 this is particularly so in highly bureaucratic forms of governance where multiple organisations at multiple levels perform complimentary or overlapping functions azhoni et al 2017a recent studies on adaptation have shown that both public and non governmental organisations including research and academic organisations play a crucial role in enabling adaptation adekola 2012 agrawal 2010 frantzeskaki et al 2014 wang et al 2013 azhoni et al 2017b at multiple scales kirchhoff et al 2015 pahl wostl 2009 water management organisations therefore need to inter act with other agencies and sectors for adapting their management to climate change berkhout 2012 wilby and vaughan 2011 azhoni et al 2017b moreover when internal resources are limited organisations may need to acquire resources from beyond their operating scale to enhance their capacity vedeld et al 2015 azhoni et al 2017b managing water in changing climatic conditions compounded by growing demands due to other developmental pressures requires effective collaboration across scales and sectors to reduce competing policy agendas vedeld et al 2015 enhance efficient sharing of limited resources and increase learning experiences recognising the need for multi stakeholder and multi sectoral engagement in water management and climate change adaptation literature on inter organisational networks which was previously concentrated in the business and services sector is emerging adekola 2012 inderberg 2012 steinberg 2009 azhoni et al 2017a however the flows of knowledge and resources from higher levels of government through cross scale networks that shape the temporal dynamics of climate adaptation lyle 2015 azhoni et al 2017a are inadequately studied to understand how socially equitable and sustainable adaptation to climate change can be enhanced azhoni et al 2017b given that climate change impacts and adaptive capacity vary between sectors actors and regions grothmann et al 2013 prutsch et al 2014 local studies are required to draw out sociological perspectives on adaptation amaru and chhetri 2013 in order to complement national adaptation policies azhoni et al 2017b 3 1 devolution of adaptive capacity to organisations operating at different levels organisations operating at different levels from national to regional and local have both distinct and complementary roles in developing and implementing adaptation strategies adger et al 2005 fidelman et al 2013 nalau et al 2015 azhoni et al 2017b the extent of involvement of the various stakeholders in the design and application of adaptation measures shapes their outcome juhola and westerhoff 2011 azhoni et al 2017a this is particularly so for water management where adaptation can involve basin level management organisations regional and national governments and local municipal bodies bisaro et al 2010 finger et al 2006 lebel and garden 2008 mollinga et al 2006 pittock 2011 wilby and wood 2012 moreover this multi level organisational interaction is shaped by the governance and organisational structure bizikova et al 2015 dannevig and aall 2015 lyle 2015 mcgloughlin and sweeney 2011 schreurs 2010 vedeld et al 2015 azhoni et al 2017a however knowledge regarding how organisations operating at different levels operate and inter act with one another and how such interactions or the lack of create enabling mechanisms or hinder adaptation is limited amundsen et al 2010 dannevig and aall 2015 vedeld et al 2015 azhoni et al 2017a due to a lack of frameworks to understand these complex structures therefore more empirical studies are required to understand how the prevalence or absence of adapting attributes of organisations operating at one scale affects the adaptive capacity at another scale pahl wostl 2009 in various socio economic contexts azhoni et al 2017b 3 2 inter organisational networks for adaptation in theory networks are self organising collaborative non hierarchical flexible and topological and the conditions of possibility and actions of network participants are generally considered as a property emerging from the relationship with other participants rather than by their own inherent characteristic leitner and sheppard 2002 p 148 149 nonetheless networks are also not without hierarchy and a few members can dominate leading to political struggles and conflicts network theory analysis goes beyond socio political studies that look at individual organisations steinberg 2009 and includes the importance of non technical approaches to planning procedures lienert et al 2013 since climate change is a multi dimensional issue the need for a multi dimensional adaptation strategy by involving multiple stakeholders across scales can hardly be ignored studies regarding the importance of networks between municipal bodies fünfgeld 2015 experts rousselin 2015 non profit organisations steinberg 2009 and individuals for climate change adaptation dow et al 2013b aulong et al 2012 and sustainable management of resources baird et al 2015 bodin and crona 2009 are emerging the existence of networks enhances adaptive capacity brooks and adger 2005 enabling adaptation to take place through both formal organisations and networks across actors at various scales juhola and westerhoff 2011 tompkins et al 2010 networks allow organisations to cross organisational boundaries and blur formal categories providing a constellation of relationships that can be activated when needed can be perturbed for new information or ways of doing or simply turned to for an extensive store of knowledge lejano and ingram 2008 p 251 as the ability of a wider set of actors to plan adaptation is greatly enhanced by the presence of an effective network understanding stakeholder networks enables the key opportunities and barriers to the flow of specific information to be determined ziervogel and downing 2004 3 3 transboundary organisations in complex systems where multiple actors from various sectors are expected to be involved transboundary organisations organisations that transcend multiple boundaries sternlieb et al 2013 p 118 are increasingly recognised as playing a key role in enhancing adaptive capacity kalafatis et al 2015 kirchhoff et al 2015 van enst et al 2016 such organisations include boundary organisations that mediate between science and policy and act as organisational structures that make collaboration possible by engaging actors on the basis of their convergent interests sternlieb et al 2013 p 120 on the other hand bridging organisations connect the actions between the various types or groups of organisations mckenzie hedger et al 2006 gawith et al 2009 tompkins et al 2010 and act as conduits between social networks with the potential to link diverse nodes of expertise for collective action sternlieb et al 2013 p 121 and provide an arena for knowledge co production trust building sense making learning and horizontal collaboration and conflict resolution berkes 2009 p 1695 likewise brown et al 2013 and loorbach and rotmans 2010 highlight the crucial role of bridging organisations and change agents in enabling sustainability transition as the same organisation can mediate between science and policy as well as between organisations operating at different scales vertically or between different types of organisations or groups of organisations the terms are sometimes used interchangeably 4 discussion the literature surveyed has identified the inter relationships regarding knowledge concerning a climate change impacts and adaptation needs section 1 b factors that enable adaptation section 3 c factors that hinders adaptation barriers section 2 3 and d adaptation manifestation section 2 4 which are synthesised in fig 1 thus fig 1 brings together the various strands of climate change adaptation reviewed in the previous sections for example assessment of the potential impacts of climate change manifesting through the reduced availability and reduced quality of water and increase in demands and increased floods risks discussed in section 1 provides the information and knowledge required for enabling adaptation planning section 2 2 besides the availability of information and knowledge the literature surveyed thus far pointed out that other resources such as technology infrastructure finances and conducive institutional mechanisms highlighted in part b of fig 1 and elaborated in sections 2 1 and 2 2 are necessary for enabling adaptation however in spite of the availability of adaptation enabling factors elaborated in sections 2 1 and 2 2 and highlighted in part b of fig 1 certain factors such as a cultural and normative behaviour b cognitive barriers c rigid and outdated laws d bureaucratic procedures and e uncertainty in climate change projections and limited resourcescan hinder adaptation these are collectively termed barriers and highlighted in part c of fig 1 and section 2 3 evidently it emerged from the literature surveyed that transboundary organisations section 3 3 which bridge the gaps between various sectors and actors and inter organisational networks sections 3 2 play a crucial role in overcoming some of the barriers elaborated in section 2 3 this is highlighted in part c of fig 1 by suggesting that transboundary organisations and inter organisational networks represent two pillars of adaptation all these factors are not necessarily sequential or hierarchical and can occur simultaneously klein et al 2014 however manifestation of adaptation highlighted by part d of fig 1 and elaborated in section 2 4 is influenced by the above mentioned factors for example water management organisations that possess a enhanced knowledge b has planned measurable targets c guided by implementable goals e for low regret anticipatory measures f led by visionary leaders that g monitors its actions and iterates its implementation are successful in adaptation this is highlighted by part d of fig 1 the overall aim of adaptation is of course to reduce risks and vulnerability and maintain or improve the economic social and environmental sustainability these various strands of adaptation are further discussed in the following subsections to highlight existing information and understanding and identify knowledge gaps since the impacts of climate change will be experienced mainly through the medium of water water organisations need to build adaptive capacity however adaptive capacity and adaptation barriers are closely related with for example the lack of adaptive capacity components such as knowledge economic and infrastructural resources and inadequate organisational mechanisms becoming barriers fig 1 part b c on the other hand the availability of adaptive capacity in itself does not ensure the absence of adaptation barriers instead the effective utilisation of adaptive capacity is reduced by barriers oberlack 2016 such as cultural and normative behaviours rigid and outdated laws and bureaucratic procedures and inaccessibility to information among others adaptive capacity is utilised in an organisational context which is itself shaped by existing laws and implemented via a normative procedure although what is normative is questionable in addition the inherent uncertainty of climate change affects utilisation of adaptive capacity such as when and where to apply financial and human resources however elements of adaptive capacity such as the existence of a flexible organisational mechanisms can overcome the challenges of uncertainty dessai and hulme 2009 inter organisational networks enable decision makers and actors to acquire additional adaptive capacity from beyond the organisation baird et al 2015 bodin and crona 2009 to overcome barriers and thus enable the translation of adaptive capacity into adaptation manifestation the role of transboundary organisations sternlieb et al 2013 in these networks is particularly important both for enhancing the adaptive capacity berkes 2009 and also for reducing the adaptation barriers oberlack 2016 current literature regarding the relationship between a adaptation enabling characteristics b adaptation barriers and c manifestation of adaptation is fragmented fig 1 above synthesises and illustrates the relationship between these three components for understanding adaptation the fig 1 above outlines the various components of climate change adaptation and is not an indication of the process of adaptation because adaptation is iterative based on the experiences and information gained over time as highlighted in section 1 the impacts of climate change are mostly manifested through the medium of water reducing its availability increasing demand and flood risks and also affecting the quality of the available water information and knowledge regarding these impacts are necessary for creating awareness among policy and decision makers the availability of technology infrastructure resources and organisational mechanisms enhances the adaptive capacity however availability of these determinants of adaptive capacity alone are insufficient to ensure successful adaptation agency related factors such as the cultural and normative behaviours of the agents the organisational contexts in which the organisation operates such as rigid and outdated laws and lengthy bureaucratic processes and inherent characteristics of climate change such as uncertainty and other bio physical features can hinder the effective utilization of available adaptive capacity literature surveyed in section 3 2 and 3 3 indicates the important role of inter organisational networks and transboundary organisations in enhancing adaptive capacity as well as overcoming barriers finally the visible characteristics of a well adapting organisation are listed in the fourth component of the diagram in fig 1 the remaining part of this section draws out the key knowledge gaps based on the literature surveyed and discusses its implications 4 1 adaptation by organisations evaluations of adaptive capacity particularly in developing economies focus on communities but not on the organisations that administer water the most important element in adapting water management to climate change the water management organisations is often ignored in the literature particularly in studies of developing economies it may be implicitly assumed that organisations which administer water for public good will adapt if the society or the sector as a whole adapts to the changing climate however organisations and agencies that are administering the ecological and societal needs of water will have to lead in adapting to the changes whilst research on adaptive capacity for example pandey et al 2011 is emerging in the context of developing economies mertz et al 2009 most studies focus on communities or the vulnerability of physical systems and rarely on the capacity of organisations which are expected to enable society and ecology to adapt to the climate nevertheless some key lessons on the characteristics of adaptation can be drawn from some of these studies climate change adaptation consists of levels of actions to be undertaken by individuals for their own benefit or by the government organisations to protect its citizens adger et al 2005 and often it requires collaboration between the two wamsler 2016 for instance adaptation actions by farmers can be seen as individual adaptation while adaptation in water management will be a mix of private and public mendelsohn 2006 wamsler 2016 conjectured that public adaptation can support or obstruct individual adaptations adaptations oriented towards conservation of the environment are public and as it becomes more public it becomes more complex huitema et al 2016 these actions take place within a hierarchical structure of different organisational bodies operating at different levels that interact influence enable or hinders the adaptation actions at another level adger et al 2005 lyle 2015 the adaptation process arnell and delaney 2006 berkhout 2012 grothmann and patt 2005 by organisations involves a perception b evaluation c enactment and d feedback which are not necessarily sequential but interactive and often reinforcing or constraining one another klein et al 2014 decision makers do not necessarily respond based on the true level of risk inherent in the changing climate and it may be not possible to determine the level of risks accurately in many instances due to the uncertainties in climate change but adaptation strategies are planned based on the perceived risks burch and robinson 2007 which may be shaped by extreme weather events engle 2013 potential threats halady and rao 2010 marshall et al 2013 and socio cultural contexts mauelshagen 2012 therefore understanding how key actors within water management organisations perceive risks is essential brown et al 2013 smith et al 2014 for evaluating the ability and likelihood of the organisation to adapt to the changing climate evaluation of the adaptation options depends largely on the available economic technological and human resources available besides political and cultural factors and may be evaluated differently by different actors arnell 2011 it also is shaped by the cognitive capacity of decision makers grothmann et al 2013 to articulate the resources requirement porter et al 2015 on other hand organisations or actors can also maladapt and thereby create unintentional and unforeseen vulnerabilities adger and barnett 2009 juhola et al 2016 kiparsky et al 2012 juhola et al 2016 p 139 defined maladaptation as a result of an intentional adaptation policy or measure directly increasing vulnerability for the targeted and or external actor s and or eroding preconditions for sustainable development by indirectly increasing society s vulnerability since adaptation is an iterative process implementing the adaptation strategies and experiences gained through such implementations are important for improving future adaptation strategies berkhout 2012 understanding whether or not the water management organisations can reduce the likely impacts and or take advantage of the new opportunities clearly becomes an important concern 4 2 adaptive capacity limitations evaluation of adaptive capacity and its application for policy making remains contested due to its latent dynamic and contextual nature although consensus on the determinants of adaptive capacity is growing its evaluation and application for policy making is contested the generic determinants of adaptive capacity of smit et al 2001 continue to be the assessment framework in different contexts sectors and scales of assessments however disagreements remain regarding the methods of data collection assessments and criteria to be used for measurement of adaptive capacity engle 2011 hinkel 2011 due to the diverse and context dependent nature of climate change vulnerability and risks evaluation of adaptive capacity is challenging because of its latent and context specific nature and the influential role of dynamic variables juhola and kruse 2015 determinants of adaptive capacity are difficult to generalise and do not carry equal weight between contexts engle 2011 pandey et al 2011 methods of adaptive capacity evaluation using aggregated indices gupta et al 2010 pandey et al 2011 have been found to be of limited use due to the difference in context and subjectivity since adaptation to climate change is variable rich multidimensional and perhaps chaotic a single approach is unlikely to understand different challenges biesbroek et al 2013 rigorous conceptual frameworks for evaluating the adaptive capacity of organisations are lacking as there remains contentions regarding the usefulness transparency and objectivity of adaptive capacity indicators hinkel 2011 not only are the methods of evaluating adaptive capacity contested but their applicability to policy making remains controversial particularly the use of quantitative indicators hinkel 2011 in addition limiting analysis to determinants of adaptive capacity ignores other key factors such as adaptation barriers and is inadequate to understand why the availability of adaptive capacity is not an assurance that adaptation will occur burch and robinson 2007 since the availability of adaptive capacity in itself does not guarantee that adaptation will occur research needs to progress to understanding how existing adaptive capacity can be utilised successfully and enhanced this will require the factors such as attitudes of actors inherent uncertainty of climate change and organisational challenges such as rigid and outdated processes of decision making that contribute to the barriers to the utilization of adaptive capacity moser and boykoff 2013 to be understood and overcome to transform adaptive capacity into adaptation manifestation 4 3 adaptation manifestations are limitedly visible the limited studies on the manifestation of adaptation are confined to industrialised countries and unlikely to have huge relevance for water management organisations in developing economies where public organisations administer water in spite of the growing efforts on adaptation examples or empirical studies that demonstrate how water management organisations have actually adapted to the impacts of climate change are limited arnell 2010 mimura et al 2014 especially in developing countries sud et al 2015 those reported e g gawith et al 2009 jude et al 2017 tompkins et al 2010 are isolated and unlikely to be directly applicable to developing economies where the socio cultural and economic contexts in addition to institutional regulations and legislations of how water is governed and administered are different moreover as adaptation depends on risk perceptions and availability of resources and technology socio economic and cultural factors are likely to play a key role in how water organisations respond to similar or different impacts azhoni et al 2017b a challenge for climate change adaptation is to use an understanding of the drivers of past adaptation efforts to support its mainstreaming into other general developmental praxis mertz et al 2009 4 4 need for identification of context to barriers few studies take into account the socio cultural and economic contexts of adaptation barriers and whilst their root causes and inter relationships are poorly understood the best top down national or regional plans do not necessarily translate into successful adaptation preston et al 2010 as adaptation is context specific and contingent upon factors including aptitude and attitude of implementing agencies towards risks wilby and vaughan 2011 political and circumstantial priorities haddad 2005 and the availability of resources and technology moser and ekstrom 2010 propose that working through barriers rather than skipping entire phases of the decision process will prove beneficial for the decision outcome therefore exposing the factors that stop divert or delay organisations to effectively adapt are crucial in the adaptation process berkhout 2012 superficially adaptive capacity and adaptation barriers appear as the mirror image of one another the absence of adaptive capacity is a barrier although the absence of certain determinants of adaptive capacity such as information and resources lead to barriers their presence does not ensure that adaptation will occur moser and boykoff 2013 therefore determinants of both adaptive capacity and barriers have to be taken into context although not necessarily as separate entities adaptation planning will require the identification of adaptation barriers and an understanding of the factors that control their emergence and sustenance eisenack et al 2014 due to the contextual nature of barriers azhoni et al 2017b eisenack et al 2014 and their dependence on actors baker et al 2012 engle 2012 defining and conceptualising the local causes of barriers remains challenging although there is a growing interest in adaptation barriers in general research on barriers for organisations to adapt is limited biesbroek et al 2013 with few studies addressing the causes of barriers and the interdependences between them azhoni et al 2017b eisenack et al 2014 moreover knowledge on barriers to adaptation in developing economies remains scattered and barriers emerging from political social and psychological factors are rarely mentioned shackleton et al 2015 this is largely due to a lack of frameworks to understand the barriers biesbroek et al 2013 as it is contingent upon the societal values o brien 2009 and attitudes towards risks adger et al 2009 besides the physical and natural circumstances adger et al 2009 contend that issues of values and ethics attitudes to risks knowledge and culture construct the context of adaptation and hence barriers are mutable therefore research on why barriers emerge and their interactions and compounded impacts that shape adaptation processes are urgently required shackleton et al 2015 4 5 role of inter organisational networks inter organisational networks particularly within public organisations and between governmental and non governmental organisations are poorly understood increasing the adaptive capacity beyond the inherent capacity within an organisation requires acquisition of capacity from other organisations which can be supported by transboundary organisations inter organisational networks can exist vertically between organisations operating at different scales azhoni et al 2017a such as the national scale or more locally or horizontally between organisations in various sectors azhoni et al 2017b as networks are expected to be self organised and not externally imposed leitner and sheppard 2002 the presence of a strong network among organisations can provide an opportunity for them to gather resources through the network even when the particular organisation does not possess the required resource to face the challenge ziervogel and downing 2004 since effective networks enhance smooth adaptation lejano and ingram 2008 networking barriers become barriers for adaptation azhoni et al 2017b burch 2010 vedeld et al 2015 although inter organisational networks between non profit organisations have been shown to enhance adaptive capacity by creating an ecosystem of organisations through sharing of knowledge and information steinberg 2009 networks among public organisations remain unexplored public government organisations tend to work in silos and not much attention has been given to how effectively services can be delivered through improved coordination azhoni et al 2017a organisations are more complex than individuals pahl wostl 2009 so that social network theories of individuals cannot be directly applied moreover the existence of social networks in themselves cannot be assumed to enhance the adaptive capacity of an organisation brockhaus et al 2012 if the network is exclusive and rigid leaves conventional wisdom unchallenged and does not enable learning newman and dale 2007 4 6 transboundary organisations and their role in enabling adaptation the role of transboundary organisations in enhancing the adaptive capacity of water organisations is poorly understood and hence underappreciated the role played by transboundary organisations in supporting organisations to adapt needs to be recognised and supported griggs and kestin 2011 mastrandrea et al 2010 mckenzie hedger et al 2006 tompkins et al 2010 such transboundary organisations enhance adaptive capacity by bridging the gap between researchers and policy and decision makers through providing or enabling them to acquire the necessary resources or to create a system conducive for adaptation eisenack and stecker 2012 additionally transboundary organisations can play the crucial role of advocacy that provides a stimulus towards adaptation and change actions such as the development of adaptation techniques building knowledge capacity and developing knowledge regarding vulnerable systems to support decision makers to take adaptation measures which are considered as adaptation facilitation can be enhanced by transboundary organisations the role of such organisations in developing economies is inadequately assessed and hence is poorly appreciated 5 conclusions the importance of adaptation particularly for water management is widely recognised gaining a consensus regarding generalised methods of adaptive capacity evaluation and application to policy is unlikely because of its latent dynamic and contextual nature even though its determinants are more or less recognised therefore studies focusing on the existence of adaptation attributes and adaptation readiness particularly using qualitative approaches to capture the contextual nuances are emerging primarily from industrialised countries but are unlikely to have huge relevance for developing economies where climate adaptation has to compete with other developmental priorities the need for adaptation at all scales taking into consideration both top down and bottom up perspectives is widely emphasized in literature however the flows of knowledge and resources from higher levels of government through cross scale networks that shape the temporal dynamics of climate adaptation are inadequately studied to understand how socially equitable and sustainable adaptation to climate change can be enhanced given that climate change impacts and adaptive capacity vary between sectors actors and regions local studies are required to draw out contextual perspectives on adaptation in order to complement national adaptation policies in this regard transboundary organisations that operate across scales and sectors have the potential to enhance the adaptive capacity of water organisations this can be complemented by improving inter organisational networks because social networks among actors can be key to acquiring adaptive capacity from beyond the organisation organisations are more complex than individuals and hence social network theories of individuals cannot be directly applied and hence network theories should be applied cautiously further the existence of social networks in themselves cannot be assumed to enhance the adaptive capacity of an organisation if the network is exclusive and rigid leaving conventional wisdom unchallenged and preventing learning as such understanding the factors that hinder inter organisational cooperation by taking into account specific contextual socio economic and political factors will support identifying and overcoming adaptation barriers in spite of the growing initiatives on climate change adaptation defining successful adaptation and discerning the relationships between intentions strategies actions and outcomes remain a challenge adaptation tracking is particularly challenging due to inconsistencies regarding what actually counts as adaptation actions and what counts as adaptation preparation models of successful adaptation for water management are limited due to the inter sectoral nature of water management inherent uncertainties in climate change scale issues and the continuous ongoing nature of adaptation since adaptation is a continuous process as new challenges emerge questions of what actually counts as successful adaptation remains the literature reviewed here provides rich insights into understanding adaptation enabling characteristics and barriers however the existing studies are inadequate to draw conclusions on the inter relationship between adaptive capacity adaptation barriers and manifestation of adaptation attributes the relationship between the various determinants of adaptive capacity and the various types of barriers and how they emerge and are sustained is inadequately evidenced by empirical studies as issues of values and ethics attitudes to risks knowledge and culture construct the context of adaptation research on why barriers emerge and their interactions and compounded impacts that shape adaptation processes are urgently required addressing these knowledge gaps will help to improve the designing of adaptation strategies thereby improving the ability of water organisations to address the ongoing challenges of

basin of the st joseph river watershed in northeast indiana usa fig 1 the st joseph river has been studied as part of the conservation effects assessment project ceap since 2002 mausbach and dedrick

essential for achieving downstream load reduction targets i e 40 reduction of the p load to lake erie established by annex 4 of the great lakes water quality agreement annex 4 2015 four nested watersheds ame alg axl and f34 ranging from 298 to 19 341 ha within cedar creek were selected for studying the dominant mechanisms controlling nutrient transport fig 1 table 1 the majority of cropped fields in these watersheds are planted in an annual corn zea mays l soybean glycine max l rotation farmer surveys in the lake erie region indicate that most fields receive fertilizer in the spring

the region while the most common sources of n are urea ammonium nitrate uan and ammonia 80 of all n applied in the region burnett et al 2015 smith et al 2017 much of northeast indiana including cedar creek is characterized by soils with slow permeability and many small closed depressions or potholes that are scattered throughout the landscape e g smith et al 2008 average slope across the cedar creek watershed is between 2 and 3 prevailing soils found throughout the watershed are mollisols and alfisols derived from wisconsinan glacial till common soil series include blount silt loams fine illitic mesic aeric epiaqualfs pewamo silty clays fine mixed active mesic typic argiaquolls and glynwood loams fine illitic mesic aquic hapludalfs closed depressions and poorly drained fields are often too wet to farm and require the use of artificial drainage to remove excess water during the growing season subsurface tile drains are typically installed at a depth of 0 9 1 0 m and convey water to drainage ditches and streams surface tile inlets are common in closed depressions and often route ponded water into the subsurface drainage network while the extent of subsurface tile drainage and number of surface inlets in cedar creek are unknown it is estimated that the vast majority 80 of agricultural fields with poorly drained soils have artificial drainage 2 2 water quality sampling and analysis water level at ame alg and axl was continuously recorded at 10 min intervals from 2004 through 2009 and at f34 from 2005 through 2009 fig 1 table 1 from 2004 through 2005 water level was measured using an isco 720 level transducer teledyne isco lincoln nebraska while isco 2150 avf doppler velocity sensors were used starting in 2006 discharge was determined using a rating curve at all monitoring locations each monitoring location was also equipped with isco 6712 autosamplers to collect samples from the center of the ditch for water quality analysis autosamplers were deployed in late march each year and were removed in mid november to prevent damage during freezing weather when deployed in the field the autosamplers were cooled to 4 c using a thermostatically controlled chiller weather stations measuring precipitation and air temperature were co located at the ame alg and axl monitoring locations precipitation values represent the total precipitation rainfall snow at each monitoring location each autosampler was programmed to collect both daily and event based water samples for daily samples 50 ml of water was collected every 4 h and composited into a single sample bottle i e 6 aliquots 50 ml 300 ml composite sample for each 24 h period event sampling was triggered based on changes in water level that were set based on previous monitoring in the watershed water samples were collected every 1 3 h during flow events whereby 100 ml of water was collected at three uniform time intervals over the sampling period i e 1 3 h and composited into a single sample bottle event water samples were retrieved from the autosamplers within one to two days following the storm event and samples were refrigerated at 4 c it was assumed that sample holding time had minimal influence on nutrient concentration based on previous work in the maumee river watershed e g heidelberg university tributary monitoring program https ncwqr org the tributary

konelab aqua 20 est analytical medina ohio dissolved reactive p drp and nitrate no3 n were analyzed on vacuum filtered 0 45 μm nylon membrane acidified samples using u s epa method 365 2 and 353 1

between total p and drp 2 3 storm event analysis over the 6 year monitoring period a total of 43 55 72 and 51 storm events were captured at ame alg axl and f34 respectively events which had multiple peaks were classified as separate events so that the water quality response to each could be quantified the current study focuses on 47 events with water quality data from at least three of the monitoring locations fig 2 for each storm event discharge was plotted against nutrient concentration to analyze for the presence and characteristics of hysteresis during the event a series of variables describing the storm event and antecedent conditions was also compiled and compared to nutrient concentrations nutrient loads and the resultant hysteresis loop full details of the hysteresis analysis and factor analysis are described in the subsequent sections all analyses were completed in r statistical software r development core team 2011 with a probability level of 0 05 used to evaluate statistical significance 2 4 hysteresis analysis a hysteresis index which describes the size and shape of storm hysteresis loops outlined by lloyd et al 2016b was used in the current study briefly nutrient concentrations were matched with the 10 min discharge data using linear interpolation williams et al 2015b both discharge and concentration for each storm event were then normalized using the following equations 1 normalized q i q i q min q max q min 2 normalized c i c i c min c max c min where qi ci is the discharge concentration at timestep i qmin cmin is the minimum storm parameter value and qmax cmax is the maximum storm parameter value normalizing of discharge and concentration was completed to provide a more robust comparison of hysteresis patterns among storm events nutrients and watersheds by effectively eliminating the effect of storm and concentration magnitude on the size of the hysteresis loop following normalization the hysteresis index was calculated as 3 hi q i c rl q i c fl q i where hiqi is the hysteresis index at percentile i of discharge crl qi is the nutrient value on the rising limb at percentile i of discharge and cfl qi is the nutrient value at the equivalent point in discharge on the falling limb in this study the hysteresis index was calculated at every 10 of discharge for each event and then averaged to produce an index score for individual events values for the hysteresis index are between 1 and 1 where the sign of the index indicates the direction of the loop and the magnitude indicates the size of the loop 2 5 factor analysis hydrology and meteorology data for periods immediately prior to and during storm events were collected across the four watershed monitoring locations and resulted in a large multi dimensional dataset factor analysis was chosen to provide a structured and transparent method of analyzing the complex dataset e g singh et al 2004 to examine the suitability of the data for factor analysis the kaiser meyer olkin kmo and bartlett s sphericity tests were performed following the recommendations of kaiser 1974 individual variables with an unacceptable kmo measure of sampling adequacy 0 50 were removed from the dataset bartlett s test of sphericity indicated significant relationships among variables and that the matrixes were factorable shrestha and kazama 2007 a varimax rotation scheme was employed kaiser 1958 factor analysis was completed using the psych package in r relationships between factor score nutrient concentration nutrient load and hysteresis characteristics were subsequently evaluated using spearman s rank correlation analysis 3 results 3 1 storm event characteristics precipitation varied between 9 3 and 85 8 mm for individual storm events monitored during the study with an average precipitation of approximately 30 mm table 2 on average precipitation intensity was 4 mm hr 1 but mean precipitation intensity during individual storm events ranged from 0 4 to 21 0 mm hr 1 discharge increased with increasing watershed size table 2 although volumetric discharge depth tended to be greater at alg and axl during events compared to ame and f34 average maximum event discharge 0 18 0 25 0 22 and 0 14 mm hr 1 in ame alg axl and f34 respectively fig 2 mean event discharge was on average between 3 2 and 3 9 times greater than pre event baseflow across the four watersheds while maximum event discharge was between 5 4 and 8 0 times greater than pre event baseflow table 2 fig 2 3 2 nutrient concentrations and loads maximum drp concentrations measured during events averaged 0 18 0 21 0 60 and 0 26 mg l 1 for ame alg axl and f34 respectively which were 6 10 times greater than observed pre event concentrations particulate p concentrations increased between 2 and 4 times compared to pre event concentrations with average maximum observed concentrations of 0 81 0 64 0 46 and 0 63 mg l 1 in ame alg axl and f34 respectively concentrations of no3 n also increased during storm events by approximately 2 5 times relative to pre event concentrations maximum no3 n concentration averaged 6 11 8 89 10 52 and 6 71 mg l 1 from ame through f34 respectively event flow weighted mean concentrations fwmc of drp and no3 n followed similar patterns across watersheds as they both increased downstream from ame through axl and then decreased at f34 fig 3 particulate p event fwmc tended to be similar at ame alg and axl but increased at f34 fig 3 event loading of drp pp and no3 n followed trends across watersheds similar to those observed for event fwmc fig 3 event drp and no3 n loading increased from ame to axl and decreased at f34 while event pp loading tended to increase downstream from ame through f34 the ratio of drp to total p varied among the nested watersheds in cedar creek as drp comprised on average 15 26 41 and 22 of total p in ame alg axl and f34 respectively for all watersheds drp and pp loads during individual events were generally less than 15 and 25 g ha 1 respectively however loads up to 79 g drp ha 1 and 117 g pp ha 1 were recorded fig 3 event no3 n loads for all watersheds were typically less than 700 g ha 1 but loads 2000 g ha 1 were observed 3 3 hysteresis patterns nutrient concentrations increased during storm events relative to pre event baseflow concentrations resulting in hysteresis loops that plotted from bottom left to top right an example of drp hysteresis across spatial scales for a single storm event is shown in fig 4 across watersheds and nutrients 163 events 3 nutrients 489 total only 6 27 of 489 of the total events were classified as exhibiting no hysteretic behavior 3 3 1 nitrate hysteretic behavior the vast majority 74 120 of 163 of storm events exhibited anti clockwise hysteresis behavior for no3 n across all watersheds fig 5 mean hysteresis index score tended to be greater at ame 0 15 compared to alg 0 27 axl 0 21 and f34 0 27 fig 6 at ame 58 of storm events exhibited anti clockwise hysteresis while 22 of storm events exhibited clockwise hysteresis in contrast between 72 and 82 of storm events showed anti clockwise hysteresis at alg axl and f34 and less than 5 of storm events showed clockwise hysteresis anti clockwise figure of eight anti clockwise 8 and clockwise figure of eight clockwise 8 hysteresis responses of no3 n were similar across watersheds with between 3 and 11 of storm events exhibiting these patterns fig 5 across all watersheds hysteresis index scores for no3 n tended to be greater in the spring march may and decrease throughout the summer june august and fall september november fig 6 3 3 2 particulate phosphorus hysteretic behavior clockwise hysteresis was the dominant pattern 78 127 of 163 observed during storm events for pp across all watersheds fig 5 mean hysteresis index score was greater at alg 0 27 and axl 0 30 compared to ame 0 20 and f34 0 24 fig 6 at alg and axl clockwise hysteresis behavior was observed during 84 and 89 of storm events respectively with anti clockwise 2 4 and anti clockwise 8 4 behavior comprising the remainder of the storm events anti clockwise and anti clockwise 8 each comprised between 8 and 14 of storm events at ame and f34 with clockwise hysteresis accounting for 64 and 69 of storm events respectively fig 5 clockwise 8 hysteresis was seldom observed except for at f34 where 8 of storm events exhibited this behavior similar to no3 n pp hysteresis index scores tended to decrease throughout the growing season fig 6 3 3 3 dissolved reactive phosphorus hysteretic behavior hysteresis patterns for drp were more varied than hysteresis patterns for either no3 n or pp fig 5 across all watersheds clockwise hysteresis was observed during 51 of storm events 83 of 163 and anti clockwise hysteresis observed during 23 38 of 163 of storm events mean hysteresis index scores for drp were lower in magnitude than the other nutrients due to the presence of both clockwise and anti clockwise behavior 0 04 0 16 0 14 and 0 04 at ame alg axl and f34 respectively fig 6 the number of storm events with either clockwise or anti clockwise hysteresis behavior at ame was similar 33 each with clockwise 8 and anti clockwise 8 both comprising 8 of the storm events alg and axl were characterized as having a larger proportion of events exhibiting clockwise behavior 52 and 66 respectively fig 5 anti clockwise 15 20 anti clockwise 8 11 18 and clockwise 8 4 5 were also observed at alg and axl hysteretic behavior for drp at f34 showed predominately clockwise patterns 44 followed by anti clockwise 28 and anti clockwise 8 17 patterns no seasonal trends in drp hysteresis index score were observed fig 6 differences in hysteresis index score for categorized events e g only clockwise events or only anti clockwise events were found among watersheds for drp which was not observed for either no3 n or pp fig 6 the magnitude of the hysteresis loop tended to be greater at ame and f34 compared to the magnitude of the hysteresis loop at alg and axl for example for storm events categorized as exhibiting anti clockwise behavior mean hysteresis index scores of 0 28 and 0 35 were found for ame and f34 respectively while mean index scores of 0 16 and 0 22 were noted for alg and axl 3 4 factor analysis factor analysis was used to explore the multi dimensional hydrology and meteorology dataset describing periods immediately prior to and during storm events table 3 four factors explained 76 82 81 and 80 of the variance in the dataset for ame alg axl and f34 watersheds respectively to determine the dominant variables of each factor loadings were computed with strong moderate and weak loadings defined as 0 75 0 75 0 50 and 0 5 0 30 respectively shrestha and kazama 2007 while the four factors describing the dataset were similar among watersheds the variance explained by each factor differed among watersheds table 3 the four factors were characterized by high positive loadings for the magnitude of the storm event e g mean discharge maximum discharge mean rise in discharge maximum rise in discharge and water yield ambient temperature e g median air temperature over the preceding 1 7 14 and 30 days antecedent wetness e g total precipitation over the 7 and 30 days prior to the storm event baseflow discharge immediately before the event and median discharge 1 and 7 days prior to the event and baseflow e g median discharge 14 and 30 days prior to the event in general the factors related to storm event magnitude and ambient temperature together explained a larger proportion of variance in the data across watersheds 48 54 compared to the combined explained variance of factors related to antecedent wetness and baseflow 27 31 table 3 across all watersheds no3 n pp and drp load was significantly correlated to the storm event magnitude factor table 4 whereby increasing factor scores for storm event magnitude resulted in greater nutrient loads nitrate and pp concentration tended not to be significantly related to any of the factors except in a few instances however drp concentration was positively correlated to the storm event magnitude factor at ame and negatively correlated to antecedent wetness and or baseflow factors at alg axl and f34 table 4 hysteresis index scores for no3 n pp and drp at f34 were all positively correlated to the storm event magnitude factor drp hysteresis index scores at ame and alg were also correlated to the storm event magnitude factor but increases in the factor score for event magnitude resulted in decreases in hysteresis index score table 4 at ame pp hysteresis index scores were significantly correlated to both temperature and antecedent wetness factors while at axl pp hysteresis index scores were significantly correlated to both storm event magnitude and baseflow factors table 4 4 discussion 4 1 controls on storm nitrate dynamics anti clockwise hysteresis was observed for no3 n during the majority of monitored storms across the nested headwater agricultural watersheds 74 of storm events fig 5 with greater no3 n concentrations on the falling limb of the hydrograph compared to the rising limb of the hydrograph potential nutrient sources and pathways for delivery in watersheds inferred from hysteresis behavior are typically based on the proximity of the nutrient source to the stream channel e g bowes et al 2015 whereby the rapid transport of near stream nutrient sources result in clockwise hysteresis and distant longer flow pathways result in anti clockwise hysteresis in watersheds such as cedar creek with vast networks of artificial subsurface drainage the interpretation of hysteresis behavior may however be more complex because even distant agricultural fields can be hydrologically connected to streams through the subsurface drainage network previous work in headwater agricultural watersheds has shown that 30 61 of annual watershed discharge king et al 2014 and 44 82 of annual no3 n loads williams et al 2015a originate from subsurface tile drains subsurface tile drains are undoubtedly the primary flow pathway for no3 n in cedar creek but data suggest that the flow paths to tile drains the intensity of subsurface drainage and the availability of no3 n may exert more control on nutrient delivery and watershed hysteresis behavior than simply the presence of subsurface drainage in the watershed studies examining no3 n concentration discharge hysteresis in both mixed land use bowes et al 2015 lloyd et al 2016a and agricultural jaing et al 2010 chen et al 2012 watersheds have found predominately 50 95 of events clockwise hysteresis patterns contrary to results from the current study based on watershed characteristics and hysteresis patterns these studies all concluded that the rapid flushing of shallow near stream groundwater was the primary mechanism controlling the enrichment or dilution of stream water no3 n concentration and that no3 n hysteresis was related to water table rise and antecedent moisture in the near stream zone in artificially drained landscapes rising water tables during storm events are also a likely mechanism to mobilize nutrients such as no3 n that are generally well distributed throughout the soil matrix or are found in high concentrations in shallow groundwater wagner et al 2008 macrae et al 2010 however the presence of subsurface tile drains may delay the response of the groundwater table and the transport of no3 n resulting in anti clockwise hysteresis as was observed in the current study the rising limb of the storm hydrograph in subsurface tile drained agricultural fields and watersheds is often comprised of event water or new water that is generally low in no3 n concentration rather than pre event water or old water granger et al 2010 vidon and cuadra 2010 for example williams et al 2016b found that up to 85 of tile discharge on the rising limb of storm hydrographs was comprised of event water as storm events progress pre event water dominates discharge and using stable water isotopes kennedy et al 2012 found that the rise in no3 n concentration in tile drained watersheds coincided with increasing pre event water contributions which supports the interpretation of anti clockwise hysteresis resulting from the mobilization of no3 n stored in the soil matrix in the ame watershed 22 of storm events exhibited clockwise hysteresis however it also is the only sub watershed in the current study with a large proportion of well to moderately well drained soils which are less likely to have subsurface drainage table 1 more rapid water table rise in response to storm events may occur in watersheds with lower drainage intensity kennedy et al 2012 such that maximum pre event water contributions and no3 n concentration may be reached quicker and perhaps before the peak in discharge i e clockwise hysteresis nitrate load was significantly correlated to the storm magnitude factor in all watersheds suggesting that larger events mobilized more n nitrate hysteresis index score however was not significantly correlated to the antecedent wetness or baseflow factor table 4 as found in previous hysteresis studies this lack of correlation may have resulted from either subsurface tile drains producing a consistent groundwater table rise in response to storm events over the range of antecedent moisture conditions present in the current study or differences in no3 n availability over the growing season across all sub watersheds no3 n hysteresis index scores on average tended to decrease over the course of the growing season with scores in the spring march may summer june august fall september november since most n fertilizer is applied in the spring burnett et al 2015 we hypothesize that more no3 n would be readily available for transport during this time of the year and would be more likely to produce clockwise hysteresis or weak anti clockwise behavior as compared to later in the growing season when most of the available n has been removed i e crop uptake or leached king et al 2016 2017 hysteresis index score was only related to storm magnitude at watershed f34 perhaps due to differences in land use or greater n legacies in this much larger watershed as compared to ame alg and axl results from the current study point to two potential sources of no3 n during storm events rising shallow groundwater elevated in no3 n or mobilization of no3 n in soil water due to rising groundwater table and or infiltrating precipitation we hypothesize that soil water is the main source of no3 n in cedar creek rather than shallow groundwater during periods of the year when subsurface tile drains are not flowing and shallow groundwater comprises the bulk of stream water no3 n concentrations in stream water are low 1 2 mg l 1 baker et al 2006 found that shallow groundwater no3 n concentration stream water subsurface tile drain water soil water in a nearby watershed in indiana usa decreasing hysteresis scores throughout the growing season also support this hypothesis 4 2 controls on storm phosphorus dynamics 4 2 1 particulate phosphorus across the nested headwater agricultural watersheds pp exhibited clockwise hysteresis during 78 of the monitored storm events fig 5 as pp concentrations were greater on the rising limb of the storm hydrograph compared to pp concentrations on the falling limb similar to no3 n most of the pp from agricultural fields was likely delivered to the stream via the artificial drainage network e g subsurface tile drains or surface tile inlets rather than direct runoff from the near stream zone macrae et al 2007 king et al 2015 in the cedar creek watershed smith et al 2008 showed that direct surface runoff to the stream was unlikely due to the topography of the watershed i e prevalence of closed depressions and because much of the direct runoff ponds behind berms along the ditch banks that were created through previous ditch maintenance and dredging in addition to upland agricultural pp sources pp derived from in channel erosion and sediment transport can also be significant during storm events kronvang et al 2012 wilson et al 2014 differentiating between these two potential sources of pp is often difficult as they result in similar clockwise hysteresis patterns bowes et al 2015 lloyd et al 2016a however the nested watershed design used in the current study provides some insight into the potential contributions of each particulate p hysteresis index score was correlated to antecedent wetness factor in the ame watershed suggesting that upland processes such as surface runoff are an important source of pp in contrast at larger watersheds axl and f34 pp hysteresis index score was correlated with storm event magnitude indicating that in channel sources may be more significant at these larger spatial scales wilson et al 2014 also noted that sediment sources to streams varied by watershed size with upland erosion from agricultural land comprising the majority of sediment in small watersheds but sediment from in channel erosion becoming the dominant source in larger watersheds hysteresis index scores for pp also tended to decrease throughout the growing season across watersheds we postulate that this change in hysteresis index score was related to seasonal differences in upland pp contributions to the stream four agricultural fields within cedar creek were monitored for surface runoff during the study period see smith et al 2015 for field information surface runoff at the field sites occurred more frequently with larger discharge volumes during the spring compared to the summer and fall this indicates that hysteresis index score for pp may be greater when both upland and in channel sources are contributing in the spring compared to primarily in channel sources later in the growing season at the axl watershed wilson et al 2014 showed that relative contribution of upland sources were greater in the early stages of the storm event hydrograph while in channel sources dominated at the peak in discharge thus while both sources of pp result in clockwise hysteresis contributions from upland sources may shift the peak in pp concentration earlier in the storm event and result in greater hysteresis index scores flow pathways for pp delivery to the artificial drainage network include both runoff into surface tile inlets and preferential flow into subsurface tile drains king et al 2015 smith et al 2015 while data presented in the current study are unable to differentiate between these potential flow pathways for pp previous research in artificially drained watersheds have shown that both can be important and result in the rapid delivery to pp to subsurface tile drains and streams for instance vidon et al 2012 showed that surface overland flow and preferential flow were equally important flow pathways with overland flow accounting for 24 and preferential flow for 18 of total stream flow during a storm event numerous studies have documented substantial pp transport in both runoff and preferential flow e g djodjic et al 1999 ford et al 2015 ford et al 2016 williams et al 2016b distinguishing between these flow pathways is a critical research need as recommendations for conservation practices to mitigate pp delivery are dependent on which flow path is targeted 4 2 2 dissolved reactive phosphorus hysteresis behavior of drp was variable with 51 and 23 of storm events exhibiting clockwise and anti clockwise patterns respectively compared to both no3 n and pp which showed a consistent response variable hysteresis patterns highlight the complex delivery of drp in artificially drained watersheds and suggest that multiple flow pathways and transport mechanisms can control drp transport similar to pp upland agricultural and in stream sources of drp could contribute to watershed p export using equilibrium phosphorus concentration smith et al 2005 found that during baseflow in watersheds ame alg and axl ditch sediments can act as a source of drp to the stream during storm events with greater drp concentrations in the stream water agricultural ditches and streams may function as a drp sink mcdowell et al 2001 sharpley et al 2007 thus contributions of in stream sources were likely minimal relative to upland agricultural sources during the monitored events the trend in drp to total p ratio across watersheds was similar to the trend observed for the proportion of events exhibiting clockwise hysteresis 33 52 66 and 44 of storm events in ame alg axl and f34 respectively suggesting that in watersheds with a larger fraction of poorly drained soils drp was more easily and more rapidly transported compared to watersheds with a larger fraction of well drained soils while subsurface tile drains in poorly drained soils may delay the peak in no3 n concentration and the contribution of pre event water to the storm hydrograph by constraining the rise of shallow groundwater tables they also facilitate the rapid transport of drp and the contribution of event water to the storm hydrograph e g vidon and cuadra 2011 williams et al 2016b in addition surface tile inlets can result in the rapid transport of surface runoff with elevated drp concentration to the drainage network smith and livingston 2013 similar drp and pp hysteresis patterns were observed for between 39 and 66 of the monitored storm events with greater alignment for those watersheds with a greater fraction of poorly drained soils i e alg axl this indicates that the processes controlling both drp and pp e g surface runoff preferential flow to subsurface tile drains transport from agricultural fields was likely the same during these events disagreement between drp and pp hysteresis patterns however suggests that drp transport can also be associated with pre event water more similar to those processes controlling no3 n delivery that is study results suggest that drp delivery can be associated with both flow through the soil matrix or bypass preferential flow in these watersheds one potential explanation for this variability in drp transport is the mixing between event and pre event water klaus et al 2014 examined pesticide transport to tile drains and showed using a multi tracer approach that both the fast transport of pesticides and the remobilization of pesticides with pre event water could be attributed to the interaction between the soil matrix and the preferential flow system which was dependent on antecedent soil moisture and precipitation characteristics since the vast majority of p is concentrated in the surface soil layers e g baker et al 2017 unlike no3 n which is distributed throughout the soil profile during some events the rapid transport of drp in surface runoff or preferential drp transport to tile drains with minimal mixing between the p enriched event water and pre event water would result in clockwise hysteresis in contrast during other events greater mixing between the event water and pre event water may result in anti clockwise hysteresis it is also important to note that there can be rapid exchanges between drp and pp pools due to sorption desorption and biological assimilation processes which could result in varying drp hysteresis patterns under wet or dry antecedent conditions in the current study drp concentration was negatively correlated with the antecedent wetness and or baseflow factors at alg axl and f34 under wet antecedent conditions greater mixing between event and pre event water may occur klaus et al 2013 and result in decreased drp concentration hysteresis behavior was correlated to the storm event magnitude factor in ame alg and f34 whereby a positive correlation was observed for f34 and a negative correlation was observed for both ame and alg the shift in the influence of storm event magnitude on hysteresis index scores is likely a result of the interaction among several factors and processes including land use spatial scale soil drainage class and water residence time while the specific processes leading to differential effects of storm event magnitude on drp hysteresis across the nested watersheds could not be determined with the methods employed in the current study study results underscore the difficulties of managing drp in artificially drained landscapes 5 conclusions nutrient concentration discharge hysteresis was examined within the context of antecedent hydro meteorological conditions to elucidate nutrient transport pathways and examine key components driving nutrient delivery processes in nested headwater agricultural watersheds of the western lake erie basin the artificial drainage network i e surface tile inlets and subsurface tile drains in these watersheds was the primary flow pathway for nutrient delivery to streams but data suggest that nutrient behavior and export during storm events was regulated by the flow paths to and the intensity of the drainage network the availability of nutrients and the relative contributions of upland and in stream nutrient sources the mobilization of no3 n in soil water due to rising shallow groundwater tables and the availability of no3 n throughout the growing season exerted a strong influence on no3 n transport watersheds with a higher intensity drainage transported water with higher concentrations but delivered the no3 n rich water later in the storm event compared to watersheds with lower intensity drainage particulate p transport was dominated by upland sources and processes i e surface runoff and preferential flow to subsurface tile drains at smaller spatial scales and a combination of both upland and in stream sources at larger spatial scales results suggest that the relative contributions of upland and in stream processes on pp transport may vary depending on the time of year dissolved reactive p transport was the most complex with both clockwise and anti clockwise hysteresis behavior observed the degree of mixing between event water with elevated p concentrations and pre event water may determine the concentration timing and delivery flow path of drp during storms storm event magnitude also resulted in differential effects of drp hysteresis with increasing spatial scales study results underscore the challenge of managing nutrients in artificially drained watersheds of the u s midwest conservation practices addressing one nutrient or flow pathway may unintentionally exacerbate the loss of other nutrients or in other flow pathways findings suggest that conservation practices addressing nutrient management and nutrient use efficiency such as 4r nutrient management i e right rate right time right source and right place for nutrient application will be key to mitigating no3 n losses from these watersheds conservation practices that decrease both upland and in stream erosion as well as practices that decrease hydrologic connectivity between fields and streams will be needed to address pp loss to mitigate drp loss a combination of both nutrient management and practices that decrease hydrologic connectivity will be needed within the study watersheds and other similar watersheds areas with poorly drained soils surface tile inlets and subsurface drainage should be considered critical source areas for nutrient transport in the current study storm events were only monitored during the growing season and it been recognized that events during the non growing season can account for a substantial proportion of annual loads e g king et al 2016 thus future research investigating specific flow paths and nutrient sources during both growing and non growing seasons is needed to better define critical source areas in these watersheds inform conservation practice recommendations and policies and ultimately attain water quality goals acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the farmers that allow us to work on their private land for the purposes of this research we also

2004 and is a main tributary of the maumee river which flows into the western basin of lake erie understanding the fate and transport of nutrients in this predominantly agricultural watershed is essential for achieving downstream load reduction targets i e 40 reduction of the p load to lake erie established by annex 4 of the great lakes water quality agreement annex 4 2015 four nested watersheds ame alg axl and f34 ranging from 298 to 19 341 ha within cedar creek were selected for studying the dominant mechanisms controlling nutrient transport fig 1 table 1 the majority of cropped fields in these watersheds are planted in an annual corn zea mays l soybean glycine max l rotation farmer surveys in the lake erie region indicate that most fields receive fertilizer in the spring prior to corn planting burnett et al 2015 smith et al 2017 the most common sources of p fertilizer applied to fields are monoammonium phosphate map and diammonium phosphate dap 95 of all p applied in the region while the most common sources of n are urea ammonium nitrate uan and ammonia 80 of all n applied in the region burnett et al 2015 smith et al 2017 much of northeast indiana including cedar creek is characterized by soils with slow permeability and many small closed depressions or potholes that are scattered throughout the landscape e g smith et al 2008 average slope across the cedar creek watershed is between 2 and 3 prevailing soils found throughout the watershed are mollisols and alfisols derived from wisconsinan glacial till common soil series include blount silt loams fine illitic mesic aeric epiaqualfs pewamo silty clays fine mixed active mesic typic argiaquolls and glynwood loams fine illitic mesic aquic hapludalfs closed depressions and poorly drained fields are often too wet to farm and require the use of artificial drainage to remove excess water during the growing season subsurface tile drains are typically installed at a depth of 0 9 1 0 m and convey water to drainage ditches and streams surface tile inlets are common in closed depressions and often route ponded water into the subsurface drainage network while the extent of subsurface tile drainage and number of surface inlets in cedar creek are unknown it is estimated that the vast majority 80 of agricultural fields with poorly drained soils have artificial drainage 2 2 water quality sampling and analysis water level at ame alg and axl was continuously recorded at 10 min intervals from 2004 through 2009 and at f34 from 2005 through 2009 fig 1 table 1 from 2004 through 2005 water level was measured using an isco 720 level transducer teledyne isco lincoln nebraska while isco 2150 avf doppler velocity sensors were used starting in 2006 discharge was determined using a rating curve at all monitoring locations each monitoring location was also equipped with isco 6712 autosamplers to collect samples from the center of the ditch for water quality analysis autosamplers were deployed in late march each year and were removed in mid november to prevent damage during freezing weather when deployed in the field the autosamplers were cooled to 4 c using a thermostatically controlled chiller weather stations measuring precipitation and air temperature were co located at the ame alg and axl monitoring locations precipitation values represent the total precipitation rainfall snow at each monitoring location each autosampler was programmed to collect both daily and event based water samples for daily samples 50 ml of water was collected every 4 h and composited into a single sample bottle i e 6 aliquots 50 ml 300 ml composite sample for each 24 h period event sampling was triggered based on changes in water level that were set based on previous monitoring in the watershed water samples were collected every 1 3 h during flow events whereby 100 ml of water was collected at three uniform time intervals over the sampling period i e 1 3 h and composited into a single sample bottle event water samples were retrieved from the autosamplers within one to two days following the storm event and samples were refrigerated at 4 c it was assumed that sample holding time had minimal influence on nutrient concentration based on previous work in the maumee river watershed e g heidelberg university tributary monitoring program https ncwqr org the tributary monitoring program has shown that changes in nutrient concentration due to sample holding times up to one week were negligible baker 2009 all nutrient analyses were conducted colorimetrically with a konelab aqua 20 est analytical medina ohio dissolved reactive p drp and nitrate no3 n were analyzed on vacuum filtered 0 45 μm nylon membrane acidified samples using u s epa method 365 2 and 353 1 respectively u s epa 1983 total p was analyzed using u s epa method 365 4 u s epa 1983 after mercuric sulfate digestion of the unfiltered samples particulate p pp was estimated as the difference between total p and drp 2 3 storm event analysis over the 6 year monitoring period a total of 43 55 72 and 51 storm events were captured at ame alg axl and f34 respectively events which had multiple peaks were classified as separate events so that the water quality response to each could be quantified the current study focuses on 47 events with water quality data from at least three of the monitoring locations fig 2 for each storm event discharge was plotted against nutrient concentration to analyze for the presence and characteristics of hysteresis during the event a series of variables describing the storm event and antecedent conditions was also compiled and compared to nutrient concentrations nutrient loads and the resultant hysteresis loop full details of the hysteresis analysis and factor analysis are described in the subsequent sections all analyses were completed in r statistical software r development core team 2011 with a probability level of 0 05 used to evaluate statistical significance 2 4 hysteresis analysis a hysteresis index which describes the size and shape of storm hysteresis loops outlined by lloyd et al 2016b was used in the current study briefly nutrient concentrations were matched with the 10 min discharge data using linear interpolation williams et al 2015b both discharge and concentration for each storm event were then normalized using the following equations 1 normalized q i q i q min q max q min 2 normalized c i c i c min c max c min where qi ci is the discharge concentration at timestep i qmin cmin is the minimum storm parameter value and qmax cmax is the maximum storm parameter value normalizing of discharge and concentration was completed to provide a more robust comparison of hysteresis patterns among storm events nutrients and watersheds by effectively eliminating the effect of storm and concentration magnitude on the size of the hysteresis loop following normalization the hysteresis index was calculated as 3 hi q i c rl q i c fl q i where hiqi is the hysteresis index at percentile i of discharge crl qi is the nutrient value on the rising limb at percentile i of discharge and cfl qi is the nutrient value at the equivalent point in discharge on the falling limb in this study the hysteresis index was calculated at every 10 of discharge for each event and then averaged to produce an index score for individual events values for the hysteresis index are between 1 and 1 where the sign of the index indicates the direction of the loop and the magnitude indicates the size of the loop 2 5 factor analysis hydrology and meteorology data for periods immediately prior to and during storm events were collected across the four watershed monitoring locations and resulted in a large multi dimensional dataset factor analysis was chosen to provide a structured and transparent method of analyzing the complex dataset e g singh et al 2004 to examine the suitability of the data for factor analysis the kaiser meyer olkin kmo and bartlett s sphericity tests were performed following the recommendations of kaiser 1974 individual variables with an unacceptable kmo measure of sampling adequacy 0 50 were removed from the dataset bartlett s test of sphericity indicated significant relationships among variables and that the matrixes were factorable shrestha and kazama 2007 a varimax rotation scheme was employed kaiser 1958 factor analysis was completed using the psych package in r relationships between factor score nutrient concentration nutrient load and hysteresis characteristics were subsequently evaluated using spearman s rank correlation analysis 3 results 3 1 storm event characteristics precipitation varied between 9 3 and 85 8 mm for individual storm events monitored during the study with an average precipitation of approximately 30 mm table 2 on average precipitation intensity was 4 mm hr 1 but mean precipitation intensity during individual storm events ranged from 0 4 to 21 0 mm hr 1 discharge increased with increasing watershed size table 2 although volumetric discharge depth tended to be greater at alg and axl during events compared to ame and f34 average maximum event discharge 0 18 0 25 0 22 and 0 14 mm hr 1 in ame alg axl and f34 respectively fig 2 mean event discharge was on average between 3 2 and 3 9 times greater than pre event baseflow across the four watersheds while maximum event discharge was between 5 4 and 8 0 times greater than pre event baseflow table 2 fig 2 3 2 nutrient concentrations and loads maximum drp concentrations measured during events averaged 0 18 0 21 0 60 and 0 26 mg l 1 for ame alg axl and f34 respectively which were 6 10 times greater than observed pre event concentrations particulate p concentrations increased between 2 and 4 times compared to pre event concentrations with average maximum observed concentrations of 0 81 0 64 0 46 and 0 63 mg l 1 in ame alg axl and f34 respectively concentrations of no3 n also increased during storm events by approximately 2 5 times relative to pre event concentrations maximum no3 n concentration averaged 6 11 8 89 10 52 and 6 71 mg l 1 from ame through f34 respectively event flow weighted mean concentrations fwmc of drp and no3 n followed similar patterns across watersheds as they both increased downstream from ame through axl and then decreased at f34 fig 3 particulate p event fwmc tended to be similar at ame alg and axl but increased at f34 fig 3 event loading of drp pp and no3 n followed trends across watersheds similar to those observed for event fwmc fig 3 event drp and no3 n loading increased from ame to axl and decreased at f34 while event pp loading tended to increase downstream from ame through f34 the ratio of drp to total p varied among the nested watersheds in cedar creek as drp comprised on average 15 26 41 and 22 of total p in ame alg axl and f34 respectively for all watersheds drp and pp loads during individual events were generally less than 15 and 25 g ha 1 respectively however loads up to 79 g drp ha 1 and 117 g pp ha 1 were recorded fig 3 event no3 n loads for all watersheds were typically less than 700 g ha 1 but loads 2000 g ha 1 were observed 3 3 hysteresis patterns nutrient concentrations increased during storm events relative to pre event baseflow concentrations resulting in hysteresis loops that plotted from bottom left to top right an example of drp hysteresis across spatial scales for a single storm event is shown in fig 4 across watersheds and nutrients 163 events 3 nutrients 489 total only 6 27 of 489 of the total events were classified as exhibiting no hysteretic behavior 3 3 1 nitrate hysteretic behavior the vast majority 74 120 of 163 of storm events exhibited anti clockwise hysteresis behavior for no3 n across all watersheds fig 5 mean hysteresis index score tended to be greater at ame 0 15 compared to alg 0 27 axl 0 21 and f34 0 27 fig 6 at ame 58 of storm events exhibited anti clockwise hysteresis while 22 of storm events exhibited clockwise hysteresis in contrast between 72 and 82 of storm events showed anti clockwise hysteresis at alg axl and f34 and less than 5 of storm events showed clockwise hysteresis anti clockwise figure of eight anti clockwise 8 and clockwise figure of eight clockwise 8 hysteresis responses of no3 n were similar across watersheds with between 3 and 11 of storm events exhibiting these patterns fig 5 across all watersheds hysteresis index scores for no3 n tended to be greater in the spring march may and decrease throughout the summer june august and fall september november fig 6 3 3 2 particulate phosphorus hysteretic behavior clockwise hysteresis was the dominant pattern 78 127 of 163 observed during storm events for pp across all watersheds fig 5 mean hysteresis index score was greater at alg 0 27 and axl 0 30 compared to ame 0 20 and f34 0 24 fig 6 at alg and axl clockwise hysteresis behavior was observed during 84 and 89 of storm events respectively with anti clockwise 2 4 and anti clockwise 8 4 behavior comprising the remainder of the storm events anti clockwise and anti clockwise 8 each comprised between 8 and 14 of storm events at ame and f34 with clockwise hysteresis accounting for 64 and 69 of storm events respectively fig 5 clockwise 8 hysteresis was seldom observed except for at f34 where 8 of storm events exhibited this behavior similar to no3 n pp hysteresis index scores tended to decrease throughout the growing season fig 6 3 3 3 dissolved reactive phosphorus hysteretic behavior hysteresis patterns for drp were more varied than hysteresis patterns for either no3 n or pp fig 5 across all watersheds clockwise hysteresis was observed during 51 of storm events 83 of 163 and anti clockwise hysteresis observed during 23 38 of 163 of storm events mean hysteresis index scores for drp were lower in magnitude than the other nutrients due to the presence of both clockwise and anti clockwise behavior 0 04 0 16 0 14 and 0 04 at ame alg axl and f34 respectively fig 6 the number of storm events with either clockwise or anti clockwise hysteresis behavior at ame was similar 33 each with clockwise 8 and anti clockwise 8 both comprising 8 of the storm events alg and axl were characterized as having a larger proportion of events exhibiting clockwise behavior 52 and 66 respectively fig 5 anti clockwise 15 20 anti clockwise 8 11 18 and clockwise 8 4 5 were also observed at alg and axl hysteretic behavior for drp at f34 showed predominately clockwise patterns 44 followed by anti clockwise 28 and anti clockwise 8 17 patterns no seasonal trends in drp hysteresis index score were observed fig 6 differences in hysteresis index score for categorized events e g only clockwise events or only anti clockwise events were found among watersheds for drp which was not observed for either no3 n or pp fig 6 the magnitude of the hysteresis loop tended to be greater at ame and f34 compared to the magnitude of the hysteresis loop at alg and axl for example for storm events categorized as exhibiting anti clockwise behavior mean hysteresis index scores of 0 28 and 0 35 were found for ame and f34 respectively while mean index scores of 0 16 and 0 22 were noted for alg and axl 3 4 factor analysis factor analysis was used to explore the multi dimensional hydrology and meteorology dataset describing periods immediately prior to and during storm events table 3 four factors explained 76 82 81 and 80 of the variance in the dataset for ame alg axl and f34 watersheds respectively to determine the dominant variables of each factor loadings were computed with strong moderate and weak loadings defined as 0 75 0 75 0 50 and 0 5 0 30 respectively shrestha and kazama 2007 while the four factors describing the dataset were similar among watersheds the variance explained by each factor differed among watersheds table 3 the four factors were characterized by high positive loadings for the magnitude of the storm event e g mean discharge maximum discharge mean rise in discharge maximum rise in discharge and water yield ambient temperature e g median air temperature over the preceding 1 7 14 and 30 days antecedent wetness e g total precipitation over the 7 and 30 days prior to the storm event baseflow discharge immediately before the event and median discharge 1 and 7 days prior to the event and baseflow e g median discharge 14 and 30 days prior to the event in general the factors related to storm event magnitude and ambient temperature together explained a larger proportion of variance in the data across watersheds 48 54 compared to the combined explained variance of factors related to antecedent wetness and baseflow 27 31 table 3 across all watersheds no3 n pp and drp load was significantly correlated to the storm event magnitude factor table 4 whereby increasing factor scores for storm event magnitude resulted in greater nutrient loads nitrate and pp concentration tended not to be significantly related to any of the factors except in a few instances however drp concentration was positively correlated to the storm event magnitude factor at ame and negatively correlated to antecedent wetness and or baseflow factors at alg axl and f34 table 4 hysteresis index scores for no3 n pp and drp at f34 were all positively correlated to the storm event magnitude factor drp hysteresis index scores at ame and alg were also correlated to the storm event magnitude factor but increases in the factor score for event magnitude resulted in decreases in hysteresis index score table 4 at ame pp hysteresis index scores were significantly correlated to both temperature and antecedent wetness factors while at axl pp hysteresis index scores were significantly correlated to both storm event magnitude and baseflow factors table 4 4 discussion 4 1 controls on storm nitrate dynamics anti clockwise hysteresis was observed for no3 n during the majority of monitored storms across the nested headwater agricultural watersheds 74 of storm events fig 5 with greater no3 n concentrations on the falling limb of the hydrograph compared to the rising limb of the hydrograph potential nutrient sources and pathways for delivery in watersheds inferred from hysteresis behavior are typically based on the proximity of the nutrient source to the stream channel e g bowes et al 2015 whereby the rapid transport of near stream nutrient sources result in clockwise hysteresis and distant longer flow pathways result in anti clockwise hysteresis in watersheds such as cedar creek with vast networks of artificial subsurface drainage the interpretation of hysteresis behavior may however be more complex because even distant agricultural fields can be hydrologically connected to streams through the subsurface drainage network previous work in headwater agricultural watersheds has shown that 30 61 of annual watershed discharge king et al 2014 and 44 82 of annual no3 n loads williams et al 2015a originate from subsurface tile drains subsurface tile drains are undoubtedly the primary flow pathway for no3 n in cedar creek but data suggest that the flow paths to tile drains the intensity of subsurface drainage and the availability of no3 n may exert more control on nutrient delivery and watershed hysteresis behavior than simply the presence of subsurface drainage in the watershed studies examining no3 n concentration discharge hysteresis in both mixed land use bowes et al 2015 lloyd et al 2016a and agricultural jaing et al 2010 chen et al 2012 watersheds have found predominately 50 95 of events clockwise hysteresis patterns contrary to results from the current study based on watershed characteristics and hysteresis patterns these studies all concluded that the rapid flushing of shallow near stream groundwater was the primary mechanism controlling the enrichment or dilution of stream water no3 n concentration and that no3 n hysteresis was related to water table rise and antecedent moisture in the near stream zone in artificially drained landscapes rising water tables during storm events are also a likely mechanism to mobilize nutrients such as no3 n that are generally well distributed throughout the soil matrix or are found in high concentrations in shallow groundwater wagner et al 2008 macrae et al 2010 however the presence of subsurface tile drains may delay the response of the groundwater table and the transport of no3 n resulting in anti clockwise hysteresis as was observed in the current study the rising limb of the storm hydrograph in subsurface tile drained agricultural fields and watersheds is often comprised of event water or new water that is generally low in no3 n concentration rather than pre event water or old water granger et al 2010 vidon and cuadra 2010 for example williams et al 2016b found that up to 85 of tile discharge on the rising limb of storm hydrographs was comprised of event water as storm events progress pre event water dominates discharge and using stable water isotopes kennedy et al 2012 found that the rise in no3 n concentration in tile drained watersheds coincided with increasing pre event water contributions which supports the interpretation of anti clockwise hysteresis resulting from the mobilization of no3 n stored in the soil matrix in the ame watershed 22 of storm events exhibited clockwise hysteresis however it also is the only sub watershed in the current study with a large proportion of well to moderately well drained soils which are less likely to have subsurface drainage table 1 more rapid water table rise in response to storm events may occur in watersheds with lower drainage intensity kennedy et al 2012 such that maximum pre event water contributions and no3 n concentration may be reached quicker and perhaps before the peak in discharge i e clockwise hysteresis nitrate load was significantly correlated to the storm magnitude factor in all watersheds suggesting that larger events mobilized more n nitrate hysteresis index score however was not significantly correlated to the antecedent wetness or baseflow factor table 4 as found in previous hysteresis studies this lack of correlation may have resulted from either subsurface tile drains producing a consistent groundwater table rise in response to storm events over the range of antecedent moisture conditions present in the current study or differences in no3 n availability over the growing season across all sub watersheds no3 n hysteresis index scores on average tended to decrease over the course of the growing season with scores in the spring march may summer june august fall september november since most n fertilizer is applied in the spring burnett et al 2015 we hypothesize that more no3 n would be readily available for transport during this time of the year and would be more likely to produce clockwise hysteresis or weak anti clockwise behavior as compared to later in the growing season when most of the available n has been removed i e crop uptake or leached king et al 2016 2017 hysteresis index score was only related to storm magnitude at watershed f34 perhaps due to differences in land use or greater n legacies in this much larger watershed as compared to ame alg and axl results from the current study point to two potential sources of no3 n during storm events rising shallow groundwater elevated in no3 n or mobilization of no3 n in soil water due to rising groundwater table and or infiltrating precipitation we hypothesize that soil water is the main source of no3 n in cedar creek rather than shallow groundwater during periods of the year when subsurface tile drains are not flowing and shallow groundwater comprises the bulk of stream water no3 n concentrations in stream water are low 1 2 mg l 1 baker et al 2006 found that shallow groundwater no3 n concentration stream water subsurface tile drain water soil water in a nearby watershed in indiana usa decreasing hysteresis scores throughout the growing season also support this hypothesis 4 2 controls on storm phosphorus dynamics 4 2 1 particulate phosphorus across the nested headwater agricultural watersheds pp exhibited clockwise hysteresis during 78 of the monitored storm events fig 5 as pp concentrations were greater on the rising limb of the storm hydrograph compared to pp concentrations on the falling limb similar to no3 n most of the pp from agricultural fields was likely delivered to the stream via the artificial drainage network e g subsurface tile drains or surface tile inlets rather than direct runoff from the near stream zone macrae et al 2007 king et al 2015 in the cedar creek watershed smith et al 2008 showed that direct surface runoff to the stream was unlikely due to the topography of the watershed i e prevalence of closed depressions and because much of the direct runoff ponds behind berms along the ditch banks that were created through previous ditch maintenance and dredging in addition to upland agricultural pp sources pp derived from in channel erosion and sediment transport can also be significant during storm events kronvang et al 2012 wilson et al 2014 differentiating between these two potential sources of pp is often difficult as they result in similar clockwise hysteresis patterns bowes et al 2015 lloyd et al 2016a however the nested watershed design used in the current study provides some insight into the potential contributions of each particulate p hysteresis index score was correlated to antecedent wetness factor in the ame watershed suggesting that upland processes such as surface runoff are an important source of pp in contrast at larger watersheds axl and f34 pp hysteresis index score was correlated with storm event magnitude indicating that in channel sources may be more significant at these larger spatial scales wilson et al 2014 also noted that sediment sources to streams varied by watershed size with upland erosion from agricultural land comprising the majority of sediment in small watersheds but sediment from in channel erosion becoming the dominant source in larger watersheds hysteresis index scores for pp also tended to decrease throughout the growing season across watersheds we postulate that this change in hysteresis index score was related to seasonal differences in upland pp contributions to the stream four agricultural fields within cedar creek were monitored for surface runoff during the study period see smith et al 2015 for field information surface runoff at the field sites occurred more frequently with larger discharge volumes during the spring compared to the summer and fall this indicates that hysteresis index score for pp may be greater when both upland and in channel sources are contributing in the spring compared to primarily in channel sources later in the growing season at the axl watershed wilson et al 2014 showed that relative contribution of upland sources were greater in the early stages of the storm event hydrograph while in channel sources dominated at the peak in discharge thus while both sources of pp result in clockwise hysteresis contributions from upland sources may shift the peak in pp concentration earlier in the storm event and result in greater hysteresis index scores flow pathways for pp delivery to the artificial drainage network include both runoff into surface tile inlets and preferential flow into subsurface tile drains king et al 2015 smith et al 2015 while data presented in the current study are unable to differentiate between these potential flow pathways for pp previous research in artificially drained watersheds have shown that both can be important and result in the rapid delivery to pp to subsurface tile drains and streams for instance vidon et al 2012 showed that surface overland flow and preferential flow were equally important flow pathways with overland flow accounting for 24 and preferential flow for 18 of total stream flow during a storm event numerous studies have documented substantial pp transport in both runoff and preferential flow e g djodjic et al 1999 ford et al 2015 ford et al 2016 williams et al 2016b distinguishing between these flow pathways is a critical research need as recommendations for conservation practices to mitigate pp delivery are dependent on which flow path is targeted 4 2 2 dissolved reactive phosphorus hysteresis behavior of drp was variable with 51 and 23 of storm events exhibiting clockwise and anti clockwise patterns respectively compared to both no3 n and pp which showed a consistent response variable hysteresis patterns highlight the complex delivery of drp in artificially drained watersheds and suggest that multiple flow pathways and transport mechanisms can control drp transport similar to pp upland agricultural and in stream sources of drp could contribute to watershed p export using equilibrium phosphorus concentration smith et al 2005 found that during baseflow in watersheds ame alg and axl ditch sediments can act as a source of drp to the stream during storm events with greater drp concentrations in the stream water agricultural ditches and streams may function as a drp sink mcdowell et al 2001 sharpley et al 2007 thus contributions of in stream sources were likely minimal relative to upland agricultural sources during the monitored events the trend in drp to total p ratio across watersheds was similar to the trend observed for the proportion of events exhibiting clockwise hysteresis 33 52 66 and 44 of storm events in ame alg axl and f34 respectively suggesting that in watersheds with a larger fraction of poorly drained soils drp was more easily and more rapidly transported compared to watersheds with a larger fraction of well drained soils while subsurface tile drains in poorly drained soils may delay the peak in no3 n concentration and the contribution of pre event water to the storm hydrograph by constraining the rise of shallow groundwater tables they also facilitate the rapid transport of drp and the contribution of event water to the storm hydrograph e g vidon and cuadra 2011 williams et al 2016b in addition surface tile inlets can result in the rapid transport of surface runoff with elevated drp concentration to the drainage network smith and livingston 2013 similar drp and pp hysteresis patterns were observed for between 39 and 66 of the monitored storm events with greater alignment for those watersheds with a greater fraction of poorly drained soils i e alg axl this indicates that the processes controlling both drp and pp e g surface runoff preferential flow to subsurface tile drains transport from agricultural fields was likely the same during these events disagreement between drp and pp hysteresis patterns however suggests that drp transport can also be associated with pre event water more similar to those processes controlling no3 n delivery that is study results suggest that drp delivery can be associated with both flow through the soil matrix or bypass preferential flow in these watersheds one potential explanation for this variability in drp transport is the mixing between event and pre event water klaus et al 2014 examined pesticide transport to tile drains and showed using a multi tracer approach that both the fast transport of pesticides and the remobilization of pesticides with pre event water could be attributed to the interaction between the soil matrix and the preferential flow system which was dependent on antecedent soil moisture and precipitation characteristics since the vast majority of p is concentrated in the surface soil layers e g baker et al 2017 unlike no3 n which is distributed throughout the soil profile during some events the rapid transport of drp in surface runoff or preferential drp transport to tile drains with minimal mixing between the p enriched event water and pre event water would result in clockwise hysteresis in contrast during other events greater mixing between the event water and pre event water may result in anti clockwise hysteresis it is also important to note that there can be rapid exchanges between drp and pp pools due to sorption desorption and biological assimilation processes which could result in varying drp hysteresis patterns under wet or dry antecedent conditions in the current study drp concentration was negatively correlated with the antecedent wetness and or baseflow factors at alg axl and f34 under wet antecedent conditions greater mixing between event and pre event water may occur klaus et al 2013 and result in decreased drp concentration hysteresis behavior was correlated to the storm event magnitude factor in ame alg and f34 whereby a positive correlation was observed for f34 and a negative correlation was observed for both ame and alg the shift in the influence of storm event magnitude on hysteresis index scores is likely a result of the interaction among several factors and processes including land use spatial scale soil drainage class and water residence time while the specific processes leading to differential effects of storm event magnitude on drp hysteresis across the nested watersheds could not be determined with the methods employed in the current study study results underscore the difficulties of managing drp in artificially drained landscapes 5 conclusions nutrient concentration discharge hysteresis was examined within the context of antecedent hydro meteorological conditions to elucidate nutrient transport pathways and examine key components driving nutrient delivery processes in nested headwater agricultural watersheds of the western lake erie basin the artificial drainage network i e surface tile inlets and subsurface tile drains in these watersheds was the primary flow pathway for nutrient delivery to streams but data suggest that nutrient behavior and export during storm events was regulated by the flow paths to and the intensity of the drainage network the availability of nutrients and the relative contributions of upland and in stream nutrient sources the mobilization of no3 n in soil water due to rising shallow groundwater tables and the availability of no3 n throughout the growing season exerted a strong influence on no3 n transport watersheds with a higher intensity drainage transported water with higher concentrations but delivered the no3 n rich water later in the storm event compared to watersheds with lower intensity drainage particulate p transport was dominated by upland sources and processes i e surface runoff and preferential flow to subsurface tile drains at smaller spatial scales and a combination of both upland and in stream sources at larger spatial scales results suggest that the relative contributions of upland and in stream processes on pp transport may vary depending on the time of year dissolved reactive p transport was the most complex with both clockwise and anti clockwise hysteresis behavior observed the degree of mixing between event water with elevated p concentrations and pre event water may determine the concentration timing and delivery flow path of drp during storms storm event magnitude also resulted in differential effects of drp hysteresis with increasing spatial scales study results underscore the challenge of managing nutrients in artificially drained watersheds of the u s midwest conservation practices addressing one nutrient or flow pathway may unintentionally exacerbate the loss of other nutrients or in other flow pathways findings suggest that conservation practices addressing nutrient management and nutrient use efficiency such as 4r nutrient management i e right rate right time right source and right place for nutrient application will be key to mitigating no3 n losses from these watersheds conservation practices that decrease both upland and in stream erosion as well as practices that decrease hydrologic connectivity between fields and streams will be needed to address pp loss to mitigate drp loss a combination of both nutrient management and practices that decrease hydrologic connectivity will be needed within the study watersheds and other similar watersheds areas with poorly drained soils surface tile inlets and subsurface drainage should be considered critical source areas for nutrient transport in the current study storm events were only monitored during the growing season and it been recognized that events during the non growing season can account for a substantial proportion of annual loads e g king et al 2016 thus future research investigating specific flow paths and nutrient sources during both growing and non growing seasons is needed to better define critical source areas in these watersheds inform conservation practice recommendations and policies and ultimately attain water quality goals acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the farmers that allow us to work on their private land for the purposes of this research we also

7417,check dams are one of the most common strategies for controlling sediment transport in erosion prone areas along with soil and water conservation measures however existing mathematical models that simulate sediment production and delivery are often unable to simulate how the storage capacity of check dams varies with time to explicitly account for this process and to support the design of check dam systems we developed a modelling framework consisting of two components namely 1 the spatially distributed soil erosion and sediment delivery model watem sedem and 2 a network based model of check dam storage dynamics the two models are run sequentially with the second model receiving the initial sediment input to check dams from watem sedem the framework is first applied to shejiagou catchment a 4 26 km2 area located in the loess plateau china where we study the effect of the existing check dam system on sediment dynamics results show that the deployment of check dams altered significantly the sediment delivery ratio of the catchment furthermore the network based model reveals a large variability in the life expectancy of check dams and abrupt changes in their filling rates the application of the framework to six alternative check dam deployment scenarios is then used to illustrate its usefulness for planning purposes and to derive some insights on the effect of key decision variables such as the number size and site location of check dams simulation results suggest that better performance in terms of life expectancy and sediment delivery ratio could have been achieved with an alternative deployment strategy keywords soil erosion sediment delivery ratio check dams network based model watem sedem loess plateau 1 introduction the chinese loess plateau is an area of about 650 000 km2 located in the middle and upper reaches of the yellow river the majority of this area is subject to severe soil erosion chen et al 2007 which often results in the loss of agricultural land and an increase of downstream flood risks the main factors determining the erosion process are the unique geology the silty sandy loam forming most of the loess is highly erodible landforms high density of gullies that bear soil erosion and dry climate xiangzhou et al 2004 the two most common ways for controlling soil erosion and its delivery to stream channels are planting and engineering measures planting mitigates the effect of wind and soil erosion thereby preventing the formation of gullies yet its effectiveness and scalability to large areas are debatable ibidem on the other hand the deployment of check dam systems is the most popular measure xiangzhou et al 2002 check dams store soil and water and support the creation of fertile farmland according to jin et al 2012 about 110 000 check dams were built by the year 2002 a number set to double by 2020 with the programme launched by the chinese ministry of water resources check dams are also often used in other countries such as spain castillo et al 2007 australia verstraeten and prosser 2008 italy bombino et al 2009 and iran hassanli et al 2009 field measurements and mathematical models are generally combined to understand the effect of check dam systems on sediment dynamics in the loess plateau zhang et al 2010 wang et al 2014 wei et al 2017 for example xu et al 2013 used the soil and water assessment tool swat to assess the effect of check dams in yanhe catchment the authors first calibrated swat for a reference period and then used the model for a second period to simulate the hydrological effects of check dams their results show that check dams had a perceivable impact on both runoff process and sediment retention a similar study was recently carried out by zhao et al 2017 who adopted the sediment distributed delivery sedd model to investigate the effect of land use changes and check dams in huangfuchuan catchment the most adopted modelling tool is arguably the soil erosion and sediment delivery model watem sedem which has been successfully employed for studies on the effect of land use feng et al 2010 sedimentological connectivity liu and fu 2016 and sedimentation in check dams zhao et al 2015 an important limitation of all these models is the inability to simulate how the storage capacity of check dams varies with time zhao et al 2017 yet this is a key factor controlling check dam s trapping efficiency and life expectancy storage dynamics could be simulated with more sophisticated physics based models e g the integrated hydrology model ran et al 2012 however these models require large amount of data not always available in this region and are poorly scalable to large catchments because of their computational requirements a second challenge related to the design and planning of check dams in the loess plateau stands in the unavailability of continuous and detailed measurements of storage capacity xu et al 2013 or of other physical processes related to storage dynamics such as sediment inflow trapping and outflow as mentioned above storage dynamics influence trapping efficiency and life expectancy which are two important criteria for check dam planning for example knowing how storage dynamics evolve with time can help determine the size and site location of one or multiple check dam s while increasing the number of check dams in erosion prone areas may not always be the most cost effective strategy climatic changes and effective soil and water conservation measures might limit the number of check dams needed researchers seem to agree for the need of a discussion on the appropriate density and distribution of check dams jin et al 2012 in this work we focus on such challenge and propose a modelling framework conceived to inform the design of check dam systems the framework consists of watem sedem and a network based model of check dam storage dynamics the idea is to first estimate with watem sedem the annual amount of sediment delivered to each check dam in a given catchment this estimate along with information on the location of check dams is then used by the second model to calculate the sediment trapping efficiency storage dynamics and life expectancy of check dams section 2 the modelling framework is tested on shejiagou catchment section 3 a 4 26 km2 area for which we study the dynamics of the existing check dams section 4 to illustrate the use of the modelling framework for planning purposes we generate six alternative check dam deployment scenarios based on various combinations of number size and site location of check dams section 5 and compare their performance in terms of life expectancy and sediment delivery ratio section 6 we use this comparison to derive some conclusions on the effect of each decision variable section 7 2 modelling framework the modelling framework consists of two models namely watem sedem and a network based model of check dam storage dynamics watem sedem is a spatially distributed or pixel based model that calculates the annual amount of sediment erosion deposition and yield in a catchment the model also simulates the annual sediment input to check dams but it does not reproduce the dynamics of check dam storage due to sediment trapping to simulate this process we developed a network based model of check dam storage dynamics both models are described next 2 1 watem sedem watem sedem is a combined and optimized version of watem water and tillage erosion model and sedem sediment delivery model it consists of three modules that estimate i sediment erosion ii sediment transport capacity and iii sediment delivery to the stream path here we provide a brief overview of each module the reader is referred to van oost et al 2000 van rompaey et al 2001 verstraeten et al 2002 for a detailed description the mean annual soil erosion rate in each computational cell pixel is calculated with the revised universal soil loss equation renard et al 1997 namely 1 e r k ls 2 d c p where e is the mean annual soil erosion rate kg m 2yr 1 r the rainfall erosivity factor mj mm m 2 h 1 yr 1 k the soil erodibility factor kg h mj 1 mm 1 ls 2 d the two dimensional slope length and steepness factor c the crop management factor and p the erosion control practice factor for a cell with coordinates i j the slope length l i j is expressed as 2 l i j a i j d 2 m 1 a i j m 1 22 13 m d m 2 sin α i j cos α i j i j m m β β 1 β sin θ i j 0 0896 3 sin 0 8 θ i j 0 56 where a i j is the contributing area at the inlet of the cell m2 d the cell size m α i j the aspect direction and θ i j the slope angle the slope steepness factor s i j is calculated using the following formula introduce by mccool et al 1987 which depends on the slope gradient tan θ i j an important factor in the loess plateau 3 s i j 10 8 sin θ i j 0 03 tan θ i j 0 09 16 8 sin θ i j 0 5 tan θ i j 0 09 to estimate the mean annual sediment transport capacity in each cell the model adopts the following equation 4 tc k tc r k ls 2 d 4 1 s 0 8 where tc is the transport capacity kg m 1 yr 1 k tc the transport capacity coefficient m and s the local slope gradient m m 1 sediment delivery to the stream path is based on a flow routing algorithm verstraeten et al 2002 which compares the income sediment volume to the sediment transport capacity in each morphological unit if the transport capacity is greater than the incoming sediment volume the sediment is then routed towards the stream path otherwise sediment deposition occurs based on this information watem sedem calculates the amount of annual sediment inflow for each segment in the stream path besides the three main modules described above watem sedem has an optional module that calculates the sediment inputs to the check dams if their location in the stream is provided the network based model described below receives this information from watem sedem and independently simulates the annual storage dynamics of the check dams 2 2 a network based model of check dam storage dynamics in a network of check dams the model simulates the annual variation of check dam storage capacity due to sediment trapping based on the location of check dams the model requires the following input stream link i e the connection between stream segments and check dam location relative to stream segments id controlled area storage capacity and initial sediment input the model provides as output the annual variation of check dam storage capacity as well as their life expectancy by executing the following operations which are summarized in fig 1 first the model processes the information on stream segments and location of check dams to generate a directed network where nodes represent check dams and arcs the connections between them in the network an upstream check dam is connected to a unique downstream check dam consider the example of fig 2 a which illustrates an idealized system of seven check dams the system is represented by a network of seven nodes cd1 cd2 cd3 cd4 cd5 cd6 cd7 and six arcs once the network has been established the model estimates the sediment trapping efficiency ste of each dam to calculate the amount of trapped sediment which is equal to the product between ste and sediment input one could simply assume that the ste of check dams with no spillways or other release structures is equal to 100 when the dams are active and 0 otherwise here we assume that check dams are composed of embankments spillways and outlet xiangzhou et al 2004 according to this and in agreement with previous studies verstraeten and prosser 2008 fang 2017 the calculation of ste is based on the following equation brown 1943 5 ste 100 1 1 1 0 0021 d cd sc cd ca where cd sc and cd ca represent the storage capacity m3 and controlled area km2 of a check dam the parameter d depends on several characteristics of the check dam e g storage capacity controlled area annual inflow texture of incoming sediment etc its value can vary between 0 046 and 1 brown 1943 verstraeten and poesen 2000 note that the network based model does not require updating the digital elevation model dem at each time step to represent the silting process in the dam controlled sedimentary areas since this process is empirically captured by eq 5 after calculating the ste the model checks for each dam its connection with the upstream ones if there are no upstream dams e g cd1 cd3 cd4 and cd5 in fig 2 a the model takes as input to the check dam the sediment produced by its controlled area calculated by watem sedem then the model uses the ste value to calculate the amount of trapped and released sediments the amount of released sediment is equal to the sediment input minus the amount of trapped sediment if a check dam is connected with one or multiple upstream dams e g cd2 cd6 cd7 in fig 2 a the sediment input is given by the sum of the sediment produced by its controlled area and released by the contiguous upstream dams for instance the sediment input to cd6 fig 2 a is equal to the sediment produced by cd6 controlled area plus the sediment released by cd4 cd3 and cd2 this operation is carried out automatically starting with the upstream check dams and following the stream path then the model updates the storage capacity of each check dam with a mass balance equation we assume that a check dam becomes inactive when its capacity is null or the ste is lower than 10 in such case the model removes the dam from the check dam system and generates a new directed network see for instance fig 2 b where we illustrate the case in which cd2 cd3 and cd7 have been filled moreover the model re calculates the new controlled area and sediment input for all remaining active check dams the operations described above are then repeated until all check dams become inactive or until a pre defined simulation horizon is reached the model is implemented in python 3 6 3 of open source anaconda software distribution http anaconda com 3 study area and model set up 3 1 study area we carry out our study in shejiagou catchment located in the loess plateau china the catchment has an area of 4 26 km2 with elevation varying between 936 7 m and 1 143 m the climate is semi arid and the mean annual rainfall for the period 1959 2000 is 388 mm fig 3 a shows the dem and the location of the gauging station and existing check dams denoted as bs 1 bs 2 bs 3 bs 4 and bs 5 the year of construction of the check dam is 1964 1972 1957 1974 and 1973 for bs 1 bs 2 bs 3 bs 4 and bs 5 respectively the average sediment yield observed at the gauging station during the period 1960 1969 was equal to 1 28 10 4 t km 2 yr 1 the slope aspect and two dimensional slope length and steepness factor ls 2 d are illustrated in fig 3 b d respectively they all suggest that the area is erosion prone the slope varies between 0 and 56 fig 3 b note that large portions of the catchment about 56 of the total area have slope greater than 20 suggesting that these areas may be subject to significant erosion the critical steep slope for shallow gully initiation and soil erosion in the loess plateau is about 20 tang et al 1998 the aspect map predicts the direction of downhill slope faces and it is measured clockwise from 0 to 360 with the value 1 indicating flat areas fig 3 c shows that most of the catchment is represented by hillslope and flat areas are almost negligible note that the higher the hillslope area the higher the probability of erosion among all parameters appearing in the right hand side of eq 1 the two dimensional slope length and steepness factor ls 2 d plays the most important role since it describes the impact of topography on soil erosion by including the combined effect of slope length and slope steepness fig 3 d illustrates the values of ls 2 d which are computed with eqs 2 and 3 desmet and govers 1996 explained that the slope gradient and ls 2 d are positively correlated hence a larger ls 2 d value implies a higher risk of erosion in shejiagou catchment large portions of the catchment have high ls 2 d values 44 5 of the area has a value of ls 2 d greater than 6 45 half of the maximum ls 2 d value that is 12 9 suggesting that a significant fraction of the area is prone to gully erosion 3 2 watem sedem input watem sedem requires several raster layers with a resolution of 20 m notebaert et al 2006 these raster layers are the dem land cover stream link and the location of check dams except land cover all layers are prepared using the map shown in fig 3 a the classified land cover maps are available for three years i e 1975 1986 and 2006 see fig 4 with an original resolution of 30 m the land cover classes are listed in table 1 along with the corresponding percentage the other data required for watem sedem are the soil erodibility factor k rainfall erosivity factor r and crop management factor c following previous studies e g van rompaey et al 2001 verstraeten et al 2002 bezak et al 2015 we calculated the value of k using declercq and poesen 1991 equation that is 6 k 3 5 38 8 exp 0 5 log d g 1 519 0 7584 2 where d g is the geometrical mean particle diameter mm the value of d g for shejiagou catchment is equal to 0 05 mm estimated using the sediment transport data collected during the period 1959 1969 which gives a value of k equal to 40 7 kg h mj 1 mm 1 the data obtained from loess plateau data centre for shejiagou catchment reports that r varies within a small range i e from 0 10255 to 0 10265 mj mm m 2 h 1 yr 1 for our analysis we used the mean value that is 0 1026 mj mm m 2 h 1 yr 1 watem sedem requires three values of crop management factor c for cropland forest and pasture respectively as shejiagou catchment has no cropland class see fig 4 the crop management factor for cropland must be replaced by that of bare land the values for bare land forest and pasture are set to 1 0 09 and 0 12 respectively following the set up adopted by liu and fu 2016 who carried out a recent study in nianzhuang catchment an area located in the loess plateau and characterized by similar elevation ranges of those in the shejiagou catchment finally the erosion control practice factor p see eq 1 is set to 1 since watem sedem does not allow to modify it 3 3 sensitivity analysis and model calibration watem sedem requires calibrating various parameters that is the transport capacity coefficient k tc low and k tc high for low and high values the parcel trap efficiency ptef c ptef f and ptef p for cropland forest and pasture and the parcel connectivity pc c for cropland and pc fp for forest and pasture before calibrating the model we performed a sensitivity analysis to better understand the effect of the parameters value on the model performance since the importance of k tc low and k tc high has already been established in previous studies c f alatorre et al 2012 liu and fu 2016 we focussed on the parcel trap efficiency and parcel connectivity as shown in the supplementary material section 1 results suggested that only the parcel trap efficiency ptef c ptef f and ptef p has a non negligible effect on the model accuracy we then calibrated the transport capacity coefficient and parcel trap efficiency using a trial and error procedure as explained in section 2 of the supplementary material to this purpose we used sediment yield data collected for three years i e 1961 1963 and 1969 at shejiagou catchment outlet leveraging the available information on the deployment year of the check dams see section 3 1 we used the check dam storage of bs 3 when simulating the 1961 and 1963 sediment yield data and check dam storage of bs 3 and bs 1 for the 1969 data as for the land cover data we used the 1975 map the values of transport capacity coefficient and parcel trap efficiency were set to 5 and 40 for k tc low and k tc high and 0 84 and 84 for ptef c ptef f and ptef p with these values watem sedem achieved a model efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 and relative root mean square error feng et al 2010 haregeweyn et al 2013 of 0 849 and 0 115 respectively a comparison between observed and computed sediment yield data is shown in fig 5 the calibration of the network based model of check dam storage dynamics is somewhat simpler since the only parameter that needs to be set up is d which depends on the check dam characteristics see section 2 2 data on these characteristics are generally not available since check dams in the loess plateau are not monitored regularly xu et al 2013 previous studies challenged by data unavailability e g fang 2017 used the mean value of d i e 0 1 which was initially suggested by brown 1943 for the same reason we also set d to 0 1 as discussed in section 1 the unavailability of continuous and detailed measurements of storage capacity hinders a conventional validation exercise notwithstanding this limitation we show in the next section how proxy information on check dam storage are used to derive some information on the model accuracy 4 sediment dynamics in shejiagou catchment in this simulation exercise we show how land cover and the existing check dam system influence sediment erosion deposition and retention within shejiagou catchment 4 1 sediment erosion deposition and delivery to study the effect of check dams and land cover on sediment erosion deposition and delivery we run watem sedem for six simulation scenarios which are given by the combination of three land covers i e 1975 1986 and 2006 with two check dam scenarios i e absence and presence of check dams in table 2 we report the simulated values of erosion deposition amount of trapped sediment catchment yield and sediment delivery ratio sdr defined as 7 sdr 100 annual sediment yield annual sediment erosion the results obtained for sediment erosion deposition and yield show the significant effect of land cover change a comparison between 1986 and 2006 for instance shows an increase in bare land and pasture with a corresponding decrease in forest areas see table 1 this significantly increases the amount of sediments eroded and delivered at the catchment outlet as already found in previous studies e g fang 2017 the deployment of the five check dams has a strong effect on the sediment yield which decreases by about one order of magnitude irrespectively of the land cover with check dams in place the sdrof shejiagou catchment is reduced from 40 to 5 a visual analysis of sediment dynamics is given in fig 6 as we shall see later the insights provided by the analysis can assist with the design of check dam systems fig 6 a illustrates the simulated values of sediment erosion negative and deposition positive rates obtained with the 2006 land cover it can be seen that sediment erosion happens in all areas characterized by high values of slope and two dimensional slope length and steepness factor as anticipated in section 3 1 the erosion process is exacerbated in the northwestern part of the catchment which is primarily used as bare land the erosion process combined with the steep slopes of shejiagou catchment results in a large amount of sediment delivered to the stream path see fig 6 b the stream segment in the northeastern part of the catchment receives the highest sediment delivery equal to 8383 t yr 1 due to its large drained area in absence of check dams these sediments are transported downstream as shown in fig 6 c which illustrates the cumulative sediment flow as expected check dams significantly decrease the cumulative sediment flow in the downstream segments fig 6 d 4 2 dynamics of check dam storage the erosion data provided by watem sedem are then used by the network based model to study how the storage dynamics of check dams evolved with time to carry out the simulation we use the 2006 land cover and the existing location of check dams illustrated in fig 7 left panel and assume that the initial storage capacity is equal to the one provided by the 1978 check dam survey report furthermore the network based model removes check dam bs 2 after six years to account for the fact that the dam was destroyed in 1984 as reported by the 1993 check dam survey report fig 7 depicts the annual variation of the normalized storage capacity i e the ratio between the available and initial storage capacity for all check dams results show that the storage capacity decreases with time but with a rate depending on the specific conditions of each check dam for instance check dam bs 2 and bs 3 show a similar decrease in the normalized storage capacity for the first years of simulation a condition that changes when bs 2 becomes inactive in this condition check dam bs 3 collects more sediments resulting in a sharper decrease of its storage capacity on the other hand check dam bs 1 and bs 4 appear to have a similar rate resulting in a simulated life expectancy of 9 and 8 years respectively this result is somewhat in agreement with the available data according to which check dam bs 1 was filled in 1990 i e life expectancy of 12 years the observed difference might be due to multiple factors such as the use of a single land cover to simulate the sediment input to check dams the effect of flood events that deliver a larger amount of sediments not captured by watem sedem or the use of an ste value equal to 10 to determine when a check dam is inactive see section 2 2 finally we observe that the storage capacity of check dam bs 5 decreases with a smaller rate than the other dams a result explained by its large initial storage yet one observes an increase in the rate when the upstream dams become inactive the simulated life expectancy of bs 5 is equal to 25 years thus in agreement with the observations reported in the 2001 check dam survey report 5 alternative check dam systems here we describe a few alternative check dam deployment scenarios whose performance is assessed with the modelling framework and evaluation criteria described below 5 1 scenarios to generate different deployment scenarios we consider three possible decision variables namely number size i e initial storage capacity and site location of check dams an increase in number and or size of check dams may improve the sediment delivery ratio of a catchment but inevitably add to the deployment costs naturally we expect the location of check dams to play an important factor too especially when considered in combination with their size to determine the number of check dams we take as benchmark the number of existing dams i e five and proceed by considering scenarios with four five and six dams i e scenarios 1 2 3 4 and 5 6 see table 3 as for the check dam size we consider three different classes namely large 5 5 10 4 m3 medium 3 5 10 4 m3 and small 2 0 10 4 m3 these values are comparable with the storage capacity generally reported for the loess plateau chunhong et al 2005 as reported in table 3 various combinations of check dam size are selected namely four large dams scenarios 1 2 four large and one small dam scenarios 3 4 three large one medium and two small dams scenarios 5 6 to decide on the check dam location we first classify the order of stream segments using strahler 1957 method see fig 8 for small check dams we consider only first order streams in particular we considered streams receiving a high sediment load i e between 2000 and 3600 t yr 1 see fig 6 b the only exception is the stream draining the northeastern part of the catchment for which we consider a large dam since this stream receives a much larger sediment input i e 8383 t yr 1 medium and large dams are deployed in second order streams which receive a larger amount of cumulative sediment flow see fig 6 c in particular we choose stream segments with a cumulative sediment load of 4000 9000 t yr 1 and 9000 37 521 t yr 1 the highest cumulative sediment load reported in table 2 for medium and large check dams respectively because of the small length of stream zone for small and medium check dams we only vary the location of large check dams in the second order stream segments the check dam location for each scenario is illustrated in figs 9 11 left panels the six scenarios are conceived to compare the effect of the different decision variables scenarios 1 2 for example differ only in the location of check dams while scenarios 3 4 account for the effect of an additional decision variable that is the number of check dams see table 3 in scenarios 5 6 we study the effects induced by an increase in the number of check dams and the use of dams with different sizes all scenarios are compared against the benchmark one which provides indications on how the performance of the check dam system could be improved 5 2 evaluation criteria to assess the deployment scenarios we consider the following criteria sediment delivery ratio which quantifies the capability of a catchment to retain sediment total storage capacity which depends on the number and size of the check dams this criterion is directly related to the deployment costs of a check dam system life expectancy the life expectancy of check dams in the loess plateau is generally limited by the high sediment input zhao et al 2017 the available statistics for chabagou catchment a 205 km2 area that comprises our study site show that 206 dams have a life expectancy lower than 20 years 117 dams have a life expectancy lower than 35 years and only two dams have a longer expected life i e 43 years zhang et al 2010 based on these statistics we consider that the average life expectancy of check dams within a given system should be at least 20 years in this evaluation we also account for the variability of life expectancy in a check dam system quantified as the standard deviation of the life expectancy ideally the storage capacity of different dams should decrease with a similar rate so as to limit the chances of abrupt changes in the annual amount of sediments that a check dam should retain such changes may be detrimental for the structural stability of a check dam 6 results and discussions in sections 6 1 and 6 2 we describe and explain the results obtained for scenarios 1 2 and 3 6 further elements of discussion are outlined in section 6 3 6 1 four check dams scenarios 1 and 2 are characterized by the same number and size combination of check dams in other words the two scenarios differ only by the location of three large check dams in the second order stream segments see left panel of fig 9 in scenario 1 the three dams located in the main channel cover about 60 of the total catchment area whereas scenario 2 s dams control a slightly larger area about 66 right panel of fig 9 this marginal modification results in a significant improvement of the sediment delivery ratio which is equal to 11 16 and 5 53 for scenarios 1 and 2 respectively table 4 suggesting that even small changes in check dam location can result in important changes of performance naturally an improvement in the sediment delivery ratio results in a decrease of the average life expectancy scenario 2 s dams are less durable than scenario 1 s one yet all dams present similar variability of the storage capacity which decreases uniformly over a period of about 20 25 years see fig 9 one also notes that the sediment delivery ratio of scenario 2 is comparable to the one reported for the baseline scenario 5 53 and 5 90 respectively but it is obtained with less check dams and with a lower total storage capacity see table 4 on the other hand the average life expectancy of scenario 2 is better than that of baseline scenario 21 0 and 11 8 years respectively overall this result suggests that similar performance in trapping efficiency could have been obtained with less and perhaps more durable check dams 6 2 five and six check dams an increase in the number of check dams and total storage capacity result in a check dam setting comparable to the baseline one see scenarios 3 4 in table 3 both scenarios have five dams and a storage capacity of 24 10 4 m3 and yield a sediment delivery ratio of 1 70 and 2 99 thereby improving the performance of the existing check dam system see table 4 this is obtained by adding a small check dam in the southwestern part of shejiagou catchment which is not controlled in scenarios 1 2 the trajectories of the normalized storage capacity illustrated in fig 10 show that slight changes in check dam locations can result in a fairly different life expectancy in scenario 4 for instance the storage capacity of all dams varies uniformly while check dams in scenario 3 present a more pronounced variability resulting in a larger standard deviation of the life expectancy 0 75 and 2 15 years for scenarios 4 and 3 respectively note that such change is obtained through a minor repositioning of two check dams in the main channel the rationale behind scenarios 5 6 does not stand in an increase of the dam s number and total storage but rather in the use of different size combinations as shown in table 3 scenarios 5 6 have the same controlled area and total storage capacity of scenarios 3 4 i e 24 00 104 m3 but this capacity is distributed across six dams of varying dimensions i e 3 large 1 medium and 2 small check dams results assessed in terms of sediment delivery ratio and life expectancy of check dams do not vary significantly with respect to scenario 3 4 suggesting that a change in the number of check dams may not be effective if not combined with an increase of total storage capacity and or controlled area similar to scenarios 1 4 scenarios 5 6 also show the importance of check dam location a repositioning of two check dams in the main channel yields different delivery ratios 1 75 and 2 12 for scenarios 5 and 6 and life expectancy 21 50 1 26 and 22 17 0 69 years in particular note the difference in the trajectories of the normalized storage capacity see fig 11 6 3 discussion the results described above suggest that all decision variables namely number size and site location impact the check dam performance location is arguably the most important factor our results show that minor modifications to check dam location for systems characterized by the same size combination and number of check dams result in perceivable changes in the sediment delivery ratio and life expectancy this behaviour was indeed observed for scenarios 1 2 3 4 and 5 6 the variability in check dam expected life does not appear to be related to the average expected life but also this aspect is influenced by location as discussed in section 5 one may favour location set up that provide similar check dam filling rates so as to reduce the risks associated to higher sediment loads to some specific dams an increase in the number of check dams leading to larger storage capacities appears to be an important factor that regulates the trapping efficiency of a check dam system as discussed in the previous paragraph a larger storage capacity should be combined with an accurate choice of the check dams location the further improvement of scenario 4 with respect to scenario 3 is attributable to a better allocation of the sediment load across all dams finally our results show that increasing the number of check dams without increasing the storage capacity may not yield better performance scenarios 3 4 and 5 6 differ by the number of dams but share similar storage capacity and controlled area resulting in comparable sediment delivery ratios 7 conclusions in this study we propose a network based model of check dam storage dynamics that calculates check dams sediment trapping efficiency variations in annual storage capacity due to sediment trapping and life expectancy the model receives the initial sediment input to the check dams from watem sedem the model is tested in shejiagou catchment a 4 26 km2 erosion prone area in the loess plateau we found that check dams altered significantly the sediment delivery ratio of the catchment which varied from 40 to about 5 in addition the network based model revealed a large variability in the check dams life expectancy which depends on the size and location of the existing dams the application of the modelling framework to six alternative deployment scenarios illustrates its usefulness for planning purposes and helps understand the role of different decision variables apart from showing that alternative check dam deployments could have improved the life expectancy and sediment delivery ratio of the existing check dam system this modelling exercise provided the following insights the check dam site location appears to be the most important decision variable controlling sediment delivery ratio and life expectancy the locations of check dams should be chosen so as to maximize the total controlled area an increase in the number of check dams along with an increase of the total storage capacity improves the performance of a check dam system yet such increase must be combined with an adequate choice of the dams location the size of a check dam should increase with the strahler stream order and or the cumulative sediment flow for example if a low order stream receives a high sediment inflow we should still consider to deploy a large check dam to increase the life expectancy of check dams in highly erodible areas one can either reduce their controlled areas or deploy additional dams in the upstream river reaches while these insights are specific to shejiagou catchment we believe that similar findings may be obtained for larger catchments which comprise more complex check dam systems for this reason future research will focus on the application of the proposed modelling framework to larger sites with more complicated stream links and check dam systems such as chabagou catchment a 205 km2 area with 451 check dams we note that the limited computational requirements of the modelling framework would make such study feasible as long as enough data on land use and check dam location are available in this respect we hope that detailed measurements of storage capacity will become available in the near future for example in the form of observations derived from field investigations and sediment sampling in check dams if this can be done we have a more robust way to validate models that simulate check dams storage dynamics finally the modelling framework could be combined with automatic search procedures e g global optimization algorithms to support the design of check dam systems one limitation of this study that may deserve further research is the analysis of the spatial distribution of the sedimentary land created by check dams which is known to enhance rainfall infiltration annual evaporation and groundwater recharge at this stage our modelling framework can indeed estimate the amount of sediments hold in each dam but not its distribution likewise the model does not simulate how cumulated sediments are distributed in the catchment in the case of dam failure if these aspects were modelled for instance with the aid of physics based models we could then account for an additional evaluation criterion such as the maximization of the sedimentary lands

7417,check dams are one of the most common strategies for controlling sediment transport in erosion prone areas along with soil and water conservation measures however existing mathematical models that simulate sediment production and delivery are often unable to simulate how the storage capacity of check dams varies with time to explicitly account for this process and to support the design of check dam systems we developed a modelling framework consisting of two components namely 1 the spatially distributed soil erosion and sediment delivery model watem sedem and 2 a network based model of check dam storage dynamics the two models are run sequentially with the second model receiving the initial sediment input to check dams from watem sedem the framework is first applied to shejiagou catchment a 4 26 km2 area located in the loess plateau china where we study the effect of the existing check dam system on sediment dynamics results show that the deployment of check dams altered significantly the sediment delivery ratio of the catchment furthermore the network based model reveals a large variability in the life expectancy of check dams and abrupt changes in their filling rates the application of the framework to six alternative check dam deployment scenarios is then used to illustrate its usefulness for planning purposes and to derive some insights on the effect of key decision variables such as the number size and site location of check dams simulation results suggest that better performance in terms of life expectancy and sediment delivery ratio could have been achieved with an alternative deployment strategy keywords soil erosion sediment delivery ratio check dams network based model watem sedem loess plateau 1 introduction the chinese loess plateau is an area of about 650 000 km2 located in the middle and upper reaches of the yellow river the majority of this area is subject to severe soil erosion chen et al 2007 which often results in the loss of agricultural land and an increase of downstream flood risks the main factors determining the erosion process are the unique geology the silty sandy loam forming most of the loess is highly erodible landforms high density of gullies that bear soil erosion and dry climate xiangzhou et al 2004 the two most common ways for controlling soil erosion and its delivery to stream channels are planting and engineering measures planting mitigates the effect of wind and soil erosion thereby preventing the formation of gullies yet its effectiveness and scalability to large areas are debatable ibidem on the other hand the deployment of check dam systems is the most popular measure xiangzhou et al 2002 check dams store soil and water and support the creation of fertile farmland according to jin et al 2012 about 110 000 check dams were built by the year 2002 a number set to double by 2020 with the programme launched by the chinese ministry of water resources check dams are also often used in other countries such as spain castillo et al 2007 australia verstraeten and prosser 2008 italy bombino et al 2009 and iran hassanli et al 2009 field measurements and mathematical models are generally combined to understand the effect of check dam systems on sediment dynamics in the loess plateau zhang et al 2010 wang et al 2014 wei et al 2017 for example xu et al 2013 used the soil and water assessment tool swat to assess the effect of check dams in yanhe catchment the authors first calibrated swat for a reference period and then used the model for a second period to simulate the hydrological effects of check dams their results show that check dams had a perceivable impact on both runoff process and sediment retention a similar study was recently carried out by zhao et al 2017 who adopted the sediment distributed delivery sedd model to investigate the effect of land use changes and check dams in huangfuchuan catchment the most adopted modelling tool is arguably the soil erosion and sediment delivery model watem sedem which has been successfully employed for studies on the effect of land use feng et al 2010 sedimentological connectivity liu and fu 2016 and sedimentation in check dams zhao et al 2015 an important limitation of all these models is the inability to simulate how the storage capacity of check dams varies with time zhao et al 2017 yet this is a key factor controlling check dam s trapping efficiency and life expectancy storage dynamics could be simulated with more sophisticated physics based models e g the integrated hydrology model ran et al 2012 however these models require large amount of data not always available in this region and are poorly scalable to large catchments because of their computational requirements a second challenge related to the design and planning of check dams in the loess plateau stands in the unavailability of continuous and detailed measurements of storage capacity xu et al 2013 or of other physical processes related to storage dynamics such as sediment inflow trapping and outflow as mentioned above storage dynamics influence trapping efficiency and life expectancy which are two important criteria for check dam planning for example knowing how storage dynamics evolve with time can help determine the size and site location of one or multiple check dam s while increasing the number of check dams in erosion prone areas may not always be the most cost effective strategy climatic changes and effective soil and water conservation measures might limit the number of check dams needed researchers seem to agree for the need of a discussion on the appropriate density and distribution of check dams jin et al 2012 in this work we focus on such challenge and propose a modelling framework conceived to inform the design of check dam systems the framework consists of watem sedem and a network based model of check dam storage dynamics the idea is to first estimate with watem sedem the annual amount of sediment delivered to each check dam in a given catchment this estimate along with information on the location of check dams is then used by the second model to calculate the sediment trapping efficiency storage dynamics and life expectancy of check dams section 2 the modelling framework is tested on shejiagou catchment section 3 a 4 26 km2 area for which we study the dynamics of the existing check dams section 4 to illustrate the use of the modelling framework for planning purposes we generate six alternative check dam deployment scenarios based on various combinations of number size and site location of check dams section 5 and compare their performance in terms of life expectancy and sediment delivery ratio section 6 we use this comparison to derive some conclusions on the effect of each decision variable section 7 2 modelling framework the modelling framework consists of two models namely watem sedem and a network based model of check dam storage dynamics watem sedem is a spatially distributed or pixel based model that calculates the annual amount of sediment erosion deposition and yield in a catchment the model also simulates the annual sediment input to check dams but it does not reproduce the dynamics of check dam storage due to sediment trapping to simulate this process we developed a network based model of check dam storage dynamics both models are described next 2 1 watem sedem watem sedem is a combined and optimized version of watem water and tillage erosion model and sedem sediment delivery model it consists of three modules that estimate i sediment erosion ii sediment transport capacity and iii sediment delivery to the stream path here we provide a brief overview of each module the reader is referred to van oost et al 2000 van rompaey et al 2001 verstraeten et al 2002 for a detailed description the mean annual soil erosion rate in each computational cell pixel is calculated with the revised universal soil loss equation renard et al 1997 namely 1 e r k ls 2 d c p where e is the mean annual soil erosion rate kg m 2yr 1 r the rainfall erosivity factor mj mm m 2 h 1 yr 1 k the soil erodibility factor kg h mj 1 mm 1 ls 2 d the two dimensional slope length and steepness factor c the crop management factor and p the erosion control practice factor for a cell with coordinates i j the slope length l i j is expressed as 2 l i j a i j d 2 m 1 a i j m 1 22 13 m d m 2 sin α i j cos α i j i j m m β β 1 β sin θ i j 0 0896 3 sin 0 8 θ i j 0 56 where a i j is the contributing area at the inlet of the cell m2 d the cell size m α i j the aspect direction and θ i j the slope angle the slope steepness factor s i j is calculated using the following formula introduce by mccool et al 1987 which depends on the slope gradient tan θ i j an important factor in the loess plateau 3 s i j 10 8 sin θ i j 0 03 tan θ i j 0 09 16 8 sin θ i j 0 5 tan θ i j 0 09 to estimate the mean annual sediment transport capacity in each cell the model adopts the following equation 4 tc k tc r k ls 2 d 4 1 s 0 8 where tc is the transport capacity kg m 1 yr 1 k tc the transport capacity coefficient m and s the local slope gradient m m 1 sediment delivery to the stream path is based on a flow routing algorithm verstraeten et al 2002 which compares the income sediment volume to the sediment transport capacity in each morphological unit if the transport capacity is greater than the incoming sediment volume the sediment is then routed towards the stream path otherwise sediment deposition occurs based on this information watem sedem calculates the amount of annual sediment inflow for each segment in the stream path besides the three main modules described above watem sedem has an optional module that calculates the sediment inputs to the check dams if their location in the stream is provided the network based model described below receives this information from watem sedem and independently simulates the annual storage dynamics of the check dams 2 2 a network based model of check dam storage dynamics in a network of check dams the model simulates the annual variation of check dam storage capacity due to sediment trapping based on the location of check dams the model requires the following input stream link i e the connection between stream segments and check dam location relative to stream segments id controlled area storage capacity and initial sediment input the model provides as output the annual variation of check dam storage capacity as well as their life expectancy by executing the following operations which are summarized in fig 1 first the model processes the information on stream segments and location of check dams to generate a directed network where nodes represent check dams and arcs the connections between them in the network an upstream check dam is connected to a unique downstream check dam consider the example of fig 2 a which illustrates an idealized system of seven check dams the system is represented by a network of seven nodes cd1 cd2 cd3 cd4 cd5 cd6 cd7 and six arcs once the network has been established the model estimates the sediment trapping efficiency ste of each dam to calculate the amount of trapped sediment which is equal to the product between ste and sediment input one could simply assume that the ste of check dams with no spillways or other release structures is equal to 100 when the dams are active and 0 otherwise here we assume that check dams are composed of embankments spillways and outlet xiangzhou et al 2004 according to this and in agreement with previous studies verstraeten and prosser 2008 fang 2017 the calculation of ste is based on the following equation brown 1943 5 ste 100 1 1 1 0 0021 d cd sc cd ca where cd sc and cd ca represent the storage capacity m3 and controlled area km2 of a check dam the parameter d depends on several characteristics of the check dam e g storage capacity controlled area annual inflow texture of incoming sediment etc its value can vary between 0 046 and 1 brown 1943 verstraeten and poesen 2000 note that the network based model does not require updating the digital elevation model dem at each time step to represent the silting process in the dam controlled sedimentary areas since this process is empirically captured by eq 5 after calculating the ste the model checks for each dam its connection with the upstream ones if there are no upstream dams e g cd1 cd3 cd4 and cd5 in fig 2 a the model takes as input to the check dam the sediment produced by its controlled area calculated by watem sedem then the model uses the ste value to calculate the amount of trapped and released sediments the amount of released sediment is equal to the sediment input minus the amount of trapped sediment if a check dam is connected with one or multiple upstream dams e g cd2 cd6 cd7 in fig 2 a the sediment input is given by the sum of the sediment produced by its controlled area and released by the contiguous upstream dams for instance the sediment input to cd6 fig 2 a is equal to the sediment produced by cd6 controlled area plus the sediment released by cd4 cd3 and cd2 this operation is carried out automatically starting with the upstream check dams and following the stream path then the model updates the storage capacity of each check dam with a mass balance equation we assume that a check dam becomes inactive when its capacity is null or the ste is lower than 10 in such case the model removes the dam from the check dam system and generates a new directed network see for instance fig 2 b where we illustrate the case in which cd2 cd3 and cd7 have been filled moreover the model re calculates the new controlled area and sediment input for all remaining active check dams the operations described above are then repeated until all check dams become inactive or until a pre defined simulation horizon is reached the model is implemented in python 3 6 3 of open source anaconda software distribution http anaconda com 3 study area and model set up 3 1 study area we carry out our study in shejiagou catchment located in the loess plateau china the catchment has an area of 4 26 km2 with elevation varying between 936 7 m and 1 143 m the climate is semi arid and the mean annual rainfall for the period 1959 2000 is 388 mm fig 3 a shows the dem and the location of the gauging station and existing check dams denoted as bs 1 bs 2 bs 3 bs 4 and bs 5 the year of construction of the check dam is 1964 1972 1957 1974 and 1973 for bs 1 bs 2 bs 3 bs 4 and bs 5 respectively the average sediment yield observed at the gauging station during the period 1960 1969 was equal to 1 28 10 4 t km 2 yr 1 the slope aspect and two dimensional slope length and steepness factor ls 2 d are illustrated in fig 3 b d respectively they all suggest that the area is erosion prone the slope varies between 0 and 56 fig 3 b note that large portions of the catchment about 56 of the total area have slope greater than 20 suggesting that these areas may be subject to significant erosion the critical steep slope for shallow gully initiation and soil erosion in the loess plateau is about 20 tang et al 1998 the aspect map predicts the direction of downhill slope faces and it is measured clockwise from 0 to 360 with the value 1 indicating flat areas fig 3 c shows that most of the catchment is represented by hillslope and flat areas are almost negligible note that the higher the hillslope area the higher the probability of erosion among all parameters appearing in the right hand side of eq 1 the two dimensional slope length and steepness factor ls 2 d plays the most important role since it describes the impact of topography on soil erosion by including the combined effect of slope length and slope steepness fig 3 d illustrates the values of ls 2 d which are computed with eqs 2 and 3 desmet and govers 1996 explained that the slope gradient and ls 2 d are positively correlated hence a larger ls 2 d value implies a higher risk of erosion in shejiagou catchment large portions of the catchment have high ls 2 d values 44 5 of the area has a value of ls 2 d greater than 6 45 half of the maximum ls 2 d value that is 12 9 suggesting that a significant fraction of the area is prone to gully erosion 3 2 watem sedem input watem sedem requires several raster layers with a resolution of 20 m notebaert et al 2006 these raster layers are the dem land cover stream link and the location of check dams except land cover all layers are prepared using the map shown in fig 3 a the classified land cover maps are available for three years i e 1975 1986 and 2006 see fig 4 with an original resolution of 30 m the land cover classes are listed in table 1 along with the corresponding percentage the other data required for watem sedem are the soil erodibility factor k rainfall erosivity factor r and crop management factor c following previous studies e g van rompaey et al 2001 verstraeten et al 2002 bezak et al 2015 we calculated the value of k using declercq and poesen 1991 equation that is 6 k 3 5 38 8 exp 0 5 log d g 1 519 0 7584 2 where d g is the geometrical mean particle diameter mm the value of d g for shejiagou catchment is equal to 0 05 mm estimated using the sediment transport data collected during the period 1959 1969 which gives a value of k equal to 40 7 kg h mj 1 mm 1 the data obtained from loess plateau data centre for shejiagou catchment reports that r varies within a small range i e from 0 10255 to 0 10265 mj mm m 2 h 1 yr 1 for our analysis we used the mean value that is 0 1026 mj mm m 2 h 1 yr 1 watem sedem requires three values of crop management factor c for cropland forest and pasture respectively as shejiagou catchment has no cropland class see fig 4 the crop management factor for cropland must be replaced by that of bare land the values for bare land forest and pasture are set to 1 0 09 and 0 12 respectively following the set up adopted by liu and fu 2016 who carried out a recent study in nianzhuang catchment an area located in the loess plateau and characterized by similar elevation ranges of those in the shejiagou catchment finally the erosion control practice factor p see eq 1 is set to 1 since watem sedem does not allow to modify it 3 3 sensitivity analysis and model calibration watem sedem requires calibrating various parameters that is the transport capacity coefficient k tc low and k tc high for low and high values the parcel trap efficiency ptef c ptef f and ptef p for cropland forest and pasture and the parcel connectivity pc c for cropland and pc fp for forest and pasture before calibrating the model we performed a sensitivity analysis to better understand the effect of the parameters value on the model performance since the importance of k tc low and k tc high has already been established in previous studies c f alatorre et al 2012 liu and fu 2016 we focussed on the parcel trap efficiency and parcel connectivity as shown in the supplementary material section 1 results suggested that only the parcel trap efficiency ptef c ptef f and ptef p has a non negligible effect on the model accuracy we then calibrated the transport capacity coefficient and parcel trap efficiency using a trial and error procedure as explained in section 2 of the supplementary material to this purpose we used sediment yield data collected for three years i e 1961 1963 and 1969 at shejiagou catchment outlet leveraging the available information on the deployment year of the check dams see section 3 1 we used the check dam storage of bs 3 when simulating the 1961 and 1963 sediment yield data and check dam storage of bs 3 and bs 1 for the 1969 data as for the land cover data we used the 1975 map the values of transport capacity coefficient and parcel trap efficiency were set to 5 and 40 for k tc low and k tc high and 0 84 and 84 for ptef c ptef f and ptef p with these values watem sedem achieved a model efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 and relative root mean square error feng et al 2010 haregeweyn et al 2013 of 0 849 and 0 115 respectively a comparison between observed and computed sediment yield data is shown in fig 5 the calibration of the network based model of check dam storage dynamics is somewhat simpler since the only parameter that needs to be set up is d which depends on the check dam characteristics see section 2 2 data on these characteristics are generally not available since check dams in the loess plateau are not monitored regularly xu et al 2013 previous studies challenged by data unavailability e g fang 2017 used the mean value of d i e 0 1 which was initially suggested by brown 1943 for the same reason we also set d to 0 1 as discussed in section 1 the unavailability of continuous and detailed measurements of storage capacity hinders a conventional validation exercise notwithstanding this limitation we show in the next section how proxy information on check dam storage are used to derive some information on the model accuracy 4 sediment dynamics in shejiagou catchment in this simulation exercise we show how land cover and the existing check dam system influence sediment erosion deposition and retention within shejiagou catchment 4 1 sediment erosion deposition and delivery to study the effect of check dams and land cover on sediment erosion deposition and delivery we run watem sedem for six simulation scenarios which are given by the combination of three land covers i e 1975 1986 and 2006 with two check dam scenarios i e absence and presence of check dams in table 2 we report the simulated values of erosion deposition amount of trapped sediment catchment yield and sediment delivery ratio sdr defined as 7 sdr 100 annual sediment yield annual sediment erosion the results obtained for sediment erosion deposition and yield show the significant effect of land cover change a comparison between 1986 and 2006 for instance shows an increase in bare land and pasture with a corresponding decrease in forest areas see table 1 this significantly increases the amount of sediments eroded and delivered at the catchment outlet as already found in previous studies e g fang 2017 the deployment of the five check dams has a strong effect on the sediment yield which decreases by about one order of magnitude irrespectively of the land cover with check dams in place the sdrof shejiagou catchment is reduced from 40 to 5 a visual analysis of sediment dynamics is given in fig 6 as we shall see later the insights provided by the analysis can assist with the design of check dam systems fig 6 a illustrates the simulated values of sediment erosion negative and deposition positive rates obtained with the 2006 land cover it can be seen that sediment erosion happens in all areas characterized by high values of slope and two dimensional slope length and steepness factor as anticipated in section 3 1 the erosion process is exacerbated in the northwestern part of the catchment which is primarily used as bare land the erosion process combined with the steep slopes of shejiagou catchment results in a large amount of sediment delivered to the stream path see fig 6 b the stream segment in the northeastern part of the catchment receives the highest sediment delivery equal to 8383 t yr 1 due to its large drained area in absence of check dams these sediments are transported downstream as shown in fig 6 c which illustrates the cumulative sediment flow as expected check dams significantly decrease the cumulative sediment flow in the downstream segments fig 6 d 4 2 dynamics of check dam storage the erosion data provided by watem sedem are then used by the network based model to study how the storage dynamics of check dams evolved with time to carry out the simulation we use the 2006 land cover and the existing location of check dams illustrated in fig 7 left panel and assume that the initial storage capacity is equal to the one provided by the 1978 check dam survey report furthermore the network based model removes check dam bs 2 after six years to account for the fact that the dam was destroyed in 1984 as reported by the 1993 check dam survey report fig 7 depicts the annual variation of the normalized storage capacity i e the ratio between the available and initial storage capacity for all check dams results show that the storage capacity decreases with time but with a rate depending on the specific conditions of each check dam for instance check dam bs 2 and bs 3 show a similar decrease in the normalized storage capacity for the first years of simulation a condition that changes when bs 2 becomes inactive in this condition check dam bs 3 collects more sediments resulting in a sharper decrease of its storage capacity on the other hand check dam bs 1 and bs 4 appear to have a similar rate resulting in a simulated life expectancy of 9 and 8 years respectively this result is somewhat in agreement with the available data according to which check dam bs 1 was filled in 1990 i e life expectancy of 12 years the observed difference might be due to multiple factors such as the use of a single land cover to simulate the sediment input to check dams the effect of flood events that deliver a larger amount of sediments not captured by watem sedem or the use of an ste value equal to 10 to determine when a check dam is inactive see section 2 2 finally we observe that the storage capacity of check dam bs 5 decreases with a smaller rate than the other dams a result explained by its large initial storage yet one observes an increase in the rate when the upstream dams become inactive the simulated life expectancy of bs 5 is equal to 25 years thus in agreement with the observations reported in the 2001 check dam survey report 5 alternative check dam systems here we describe a few alternative check dam deployment scenarios whose performance is assessed with the modelling framework and evaluation criteria described below 5 1 scenarios to generate different deployment scenarios we consider three possible decision variables namely number size i e initial storage capacity and site location of check dams an increase in number and or size of check dams may improve the sediment delivery ratio of a catchment but inevitably add to the deployment costs naturally we expect the location of check dams to play an important factor too especially when considered in combination with their size to determine the number of check dams we take as benchmark the number of existing dams i e five and proceed by considering scenarios with four five and six dams i e scenarios 1 2 3 4 and 5 6 see table 3 as for the check dam size we consider three different classes namely large 5 5 10 4 m3 medium 3 5 10 4 m3 and small 2 0 10 4 m3 these values are comparable with the storage capacity generally reported for the loess plateau chunhong et al 2005 as reported in table 3 various combinations of check dam size are selected namely four large dams scenarios 1 2 four large and one small dam scenarios 3 4 three large one medium and two small dams scenarios 5 6 to decide on the check dam location we first classify the order of stream segments using strahler 1957 method see fig 8 for small check dams we consider only first order streams in particular we considered streams receiving a high sediment load i e between 2000 and 3600 t yr 1 see fig 6 b the only exception is the stream draining the northeastern part of the catchment for which we consider a large dam since this stream receives a much larger sediment input i e 8383 t yr 1 medium and large dams are deployed in second order streams which receive a larger amount of cumulative sediment flow see fig 6 c in particular we choose stream segments with a cumulative sediment load of 4000 9000 t yr 1 and 9000 37 521 t yr 1 the highest cumulative sediment load reported in table 2 for medium and large check dams respectively because of the small length of stream zone for small and medium check dams we only vary the location of large check dams in the second order stream segments the check dam location for each scenario is illustrated in figs 9 11 left panels the six scenarios are conceived to compare the effect of the different decision variables scenarios 1 2 for example differ only in the location of check dams while scenarios 3 4 account for the effect of an additional decision variable that is the number of check dams see table 3 in scenarios 5 6 we study the effects induced by an increase in the number of check dams and the use of dams with different sizes all scenarios are compared against the benchmark one which provides indications on how the performance of the check dam system could be improved 5 2 evaluation criteria to assess the deployment scenarios we consider the following criteria sediment delivery ratio which quantifies the capability of a catchment to retain sediment total storage capacity which depends on the number and size of the check dams this criterion is directly related to the deployment costs of a check dam system life expectancy the life expectancy of check dams in the loess plateau is generally limited by the high sediment input zhao et al 2017 the available statistics for chabagou catchment a 205 km2 area that comprises our study site show that 206 dams have a life expectancy lower than 20 years 117 dams have a life expectancy lower than 35 years and only two dams have a longer expected life i e 43 years zhang et al 2010 based on these statistics we consider that the average life expectancy of check dams within a given system should be at least 20 years in this evaluation we also account for the variability of life expectancy in a check dam system quantified as the standard deviation of the life expectancy ideally the storage capacity of different dams should decrease with a similar rate so as to limit the chances of abrupt changes in the annual amount of sediments that a check dam should retain such changes may be detrimental for the structural stability of a check dam 6 results and discussions in sections 6 1 and 6 2 we describe and explain the results obtained for scenarios 1 2 and 3 6 further elements of discussion are outlined in section 6 3 6 1 four check dams scenarios 1 and 2 are characterized by the same number and size combination of check dams in other words the two scenarios differ only by the location of three large check dams in the second order stream segments see left panel of fig 9 in scenario 1 the three dams located in the main channel cover about 60 of the total catchment area whereas scenario 2 s dams control a slightly larger area about 66 right panel of fig 9 this marginal modification results in a significant improvement of the sediment delivery ratio which is equal to 11 16 and 5 53 for scenarios 1 and 2 respectively table 4 suggesting that even small changes in check dam location can result in important changes of performance naturally an improvement in the sediment delivery ratio results in a decrease of the average life expectancy scenario 2 s dams are less durable than scenario 1 s one yet all dams present similar variability of the storage capacity which decreases uniformly over a period of about 20 25 years see fig 9 one also notes that the sediment delivery ratio of scenario 2 is comparable to the one reported for the baseline scenario 5 53 and 5 90 respectively but it is obtained with less check dams and with a lower total storage capacity see table 4 on the other hand the average life expectancy of scenario 2 is better than that of baseline scenario 21 0 and 11 8 years respectively overall this result suggests that similar performance in trapping efficiency could have been obtained with less and perhaps more durable check dams 6 2 five and six check dams an increase in the number of check dams and total storage capacity result in a check dam setting comparable to the baseline one see scenarios 3 4 in table 3 both scenarios have five dams and a storage capacity of 24 10 4 m3 and yield a sediment delivery ratio of 1 70 and 2 99 thereby improving the performance of the existing check dam system see table 4 this is obtained by adding a small check dam in the southwestern part of shejiagou catchment which is not controlled in scenarios 1 2 the trajectories of the normalized storage capacity illustrated in fig 10 show that slight changes in check dam locations can result in a fairly different life expectancy in scenario 4 for instance the storage capacity of all dams varies uniformly while check dams in scenario 3 present a more pronounced variability resulting in a larger standard deviation of the life expectancy 0 75 and 2 15 years for scenarios 4 and 3 respectively note that such change is obtained through a minor repositioning of two check dams in the main channel the rationale behind scenarios 5 6 does not stand in an increase of the dam s number and total storage but rather in the use of different size combinations as shown in table 3 scenarios 5 6 have the same controlled area and total storage capacity of scenarios 3 4 i e 24 00 104 m3 but this capacity is distributed across six dams of varying dimensions i e 3 large 1 medium and 2 small check dams results assessed in terms of sediment delivery ratio and life expectancy of check dams do not vary significantly with respect to scenario 3 4 suggesting that a change in the number of check dams may not be effective if not combined with an increase of total storage capacity and or controlled area similar to scenarios 1 4 scenarios 5 6 also show the importance of check dam location a repositioning of two check dams in the main channel yields different delivery ratios 1 75 and 2 12 for scenarios 5 and 6 and life expectancy 21 50 1 26 and 22 17 0 69 years in particular note the difference in the trajectories of the normalized storage capacity see fig 11 6 3 discussion the results described above suggest that all decision variables namely number size and site location impact the check dam performance location is arguably the most important factor our results show that minor modifications to check dam location for systems characterized by the same size combination and number of check dams result in perceivable changes in the sediment delivery ratio and life expectancy this behaviour was indeed observed for scenarios 1 2 3 4 and 5 6 the variability in check dam expected life does not appear to be related to the average expected life but also this aspect is influenced by location as discussed in section 5 one may favour location set up that provide similar check dam filling rates so as to reduce the risks associated to higher sediment loads to some specific dams an increase in the number of check dams leading to larger storage capacities appears to be an important factor that regulates the trapping efficiency of a check dam system as discussed in the previous paragraph a larger storage capacity should be combined with an accurate choice of the check dams location the further improvement of scenario 4 with respect to scenario 3 is attributable to a better allocation of the sediment load across all dams finally our results show that increasing the number of check dams without increasing the storage capacity may not yield better performance scenarios 3 4 and 5 6 differ by the number of dams but share similar storage capacity and controlled area resulting in comparable sediment delivery ratios 7 conclusions in this study we propose a network based model of check dam storage dynamics that calculates check dams sediment trapping efficiency variations in annual storage capacity due to sediment trapping and life expectancy the model receives the initial sediment input to the check dams from watem sedem the model is tested in shejiagou catchment a 4 26 km2 erosion prone area in the loess plateau we found that check dams altered significantly the sediment delivery ratio of the catchment which varied from 40 to about 5 in addition the network based model revealed a large variability in the check dams life expectancy which depends on the size and location of the existing dams the application of the modelling framework to six alternative deployment scenarios illustrates its usefulness for planning purposes and helps understand the role of different decision variables apart from showing that alternative check dam deployments could have improved the life expectancy and sediment delivery ratio of the existing check dam system this modelling exercise provided the following insights the check dam site location appears to be the most important decision variable controlling sediment delivery ratio and life expectancy the locations of check dams should be chosen so as to maximize the total controlled area an increase in the number of check dams along with an increase of the total storage capacity improves the performance of a check dam system yet such increase must be combined with an adequate choice of the dams location the size of a check dam should increase with the strahler stream order and or the cumulative sediment flow for example if a low order stream receives a high sediment inflow we should still consider to deploy a large check dam to increase the life expectancy of check dams in highly erodible areas one can either reduce their controlled areas or deploy additional dams in the upstream river reaches while these insights are specific to shejiagou catchment we believe that similar findings may be obtained for larger catchments which comprise more complex check dam systems for this reason future research will focus on the application of the proposed modelling framework to larger sites with more complicated stream links and check dam systems such as chabagou catchment a 205 km2 area with 451 check dams we note that the limited computational requirements of the modelling framework would make such study feasible as long as enough data on land use and check dam location are available in this respect we hope that detailed measurements of storage capacity will become available in the near future for example in the form of observations derived from field investigations and sediment sampling in check dams if this can be done we have a more robust way to validate models that simulate check dams storage dynamics finally the modelling framework could be combined with automatic search procedures e g global optimization algorithms to support the design of check dam systems one limitation of this study that may deserve further research is the analysis of the spatial distribution of the sedimentary land created by check dams which is known to enhance rainfall infiltration annual evaporation and groundwater recharge at this stage our modelling framework can indeed estimate the amount of sediments hold in each dam but not its distribution likewise the model does not simulate how cumulated sediments are distributed in the catchment in the case of dam failure if these aspects were modelled for instance with the aid of physics based models we could then account for an additional evaluation criterion such as the maximization of the sedimentary lands

7418,the impacts of urbanization on floods droughts and the overall river regime have been largely investigated in the past few decades but the quantification and the prediction of such impacts still remain a challenge in hydrology we gathered a sample of 142 catchments that have a documented increase in urban areas over the hydrometeorological record period in the united states the changes in river flow regimes due to urban spread were differentiated from climate variability using the gr4j conceptual hydrological model high low and mean flows were impacted at a threshold of a 10 total impervious area moreover the historical evolution of urban landscape spatial patterns was used to further detail the urbanization process in terms of extent and fragmentation of urban areas throughout the catchment and to help interpret the divergent impacts observed in streamflow behaviors regression analysis pointed out the importance of major wastewater treatment facilities that might overpass the effects of imperviousness and therefore further research should either take them explicitly into account or select a wastewater facility free catchment sample to clearly evaluate the impacts of urban landscape on low flows keywords rainfall runoff modeling urban fragmentation total imperviousness threshold effect urbanization impacts 1 introduction 1 1 urban transformation of river landscapes in a global context today 54 of the world s population lives in urban areas a proportion that is expected to increase to 66 by 2050 united nations 2014 the environmental impacts of such an increase will certainly be huge but many facets of this impact remain difficult to assess the hydrological impact of urbanization while largely studied for more than 50 years see e g leopold 1968 is very difficult to predict and even the quantification of this impact for historical urban sprawl appears difficult to assess this is quite a problem since recent urban planning or mitigation strategies could be particularly useful in the near future and often involve the restoration of what is assumed to be natural hydrological conditions trinh and chui 2013 1 2 identifying and quantifying the impact of urbanization on catchment response local hydrological processes can be deeply modified in urban settings the development of impervious areas alters surface infiltration of water resulting in increased surface runoff and decreased evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge see the recent review by salvadore et al 2015 at the catchment scale typically 10 10000 km2 due to the high spatial heterogeneity of impervious areas the hydrological impact of urbanization is more complex table 1 provides an overview of previous studies that investigate the hydrological impact of urbanization at the catchment scale this synthesis focuses on studieswith observed streamflow data along spatial or temporal gradients of urbanization therefore studies based only on simulation of hydrological models without observations typically simulations performed on land use scenario were not included it appears from table 1 that diverse impacts were reported depending on the flow characteristics investigated while the increase in the peak streamflow of flood events is supported by both empirical and modeling studies the amount of change in high flows is highly variable among studies increased catchment imperviousness reduces soil infiltration and consequently baseflow which may decrease low flows at the outlet of the catchment kauffman et al 2009 however other factors might mitigate or emphasize the impact on low flows reduced evaporation from urban areas compared to other land covers rose and peters 2001 modifications of soil permeability due to topographic modification and soil compaction e g hibbs and sharp 2012 in addition discharge from wastewater treatment facilities e g göbel et al 2004 inter basin water transfer e g barringer et al 1994 and or groundwater pumping e g claessens et al 2006 often occur on urban catchments and may impact the entire flow range most particularly low flows consequently there is no consensus on the impact of urbanization on catchment low flows that may either increase or decrease bhaskar et al 2015 the impact of urbanization on mean annual flows is complex as a result of the multiple factors described above previous studies point out that mean annual flow is either unimpacted e g rose and peters 2001 or increased e g dewalle et al 2000 1 3 relating the hydrological impact on urban landscapes the imperviousness of the catchment has become a benchmark for urban design and zoning criteria arnold and gibbons 1996 schueler et al 2009 at the catchment scale imperviousness is often calculated as the area weighted mean of land use categories with categorical imperviousness values mean catchment imperviousness also referred to as total imperviousness area tia is often suggested to explain the hydrological impact of urbanization diverse mean catchment imperviousness threshold values above which hydrological characteristics are modified have been put forward some authors reported significant effects of urbanization at a very low level 5 of imperviousness booth and jackson 1997 yang et al 2010 while others observed very small changes up to 20 brun and band 2000 this wide range of imperviousness threshold values suggests that the total imperviousness of a catchment cannot explain all of the diversity of the hydrological impacts of urbanization the total imperviousness area is probably a relevant first order aggregated measure but might overlook other relevant explanatory factors alberti et al 2007 that mitigate and in some cases offset the impact of increased imperviousness these factors are diverse and include the location of the impervious area within the catchment mejía and moglen 2010a in particular its interconnectedness mejía and moglen 2010b and its proximity to the drainage network grove et al 1998 sheeder et al 2002 as well as the development of hydraulic structures such as detention basins and natural pathway modifications ogden et al 2011 in addition to the natural geomorphological settings of the catchment such as the catchment area the hydrographic network drainage density and the presence of aquifers konrad et al 2005 so far few studies have attempted to empirically quantify the effects of these urban land patterns on hydrological catchment behavior 1 4 scope of the paper the objective of this study was to determine whether general conclusions can be drawn on the impact of urbanization on the flow characteristics at the outlet of urbanized catchments to this aim a hydrological model was used to quantify the historical change of streamflow characteristics mean flow low flow and high flow due to urbanization and distinguish it from the change due to climate variability then the change of streamflow characteristics is related to modifications of urban landscape metrics within a regression framework in order to hierarchize the impacts of land use management to determine flow changes attributable to land use changes and not climate variability we followed in this paper the so called model residual approach which was found to give comparable results to the paired catchment approach on a set of 24 urban catchments salavati et al 2016 the present study was conducted on 142 u s urban catchments in order to reach general conclusions on several open questions is there a threshold effect of imperviousness on the impact of urbanization is the effect of urbanization common to all catchments does urbanization affect low mean and high flows differently does the spatial organization of urban areas play a significant role on the impact of urbanization at the catchment scale 2 data 2 1 catchment selection the catchments studied were selected among the 9067 catchments of the gages ii database a preliminary selection was made according to the following criteria i a relatively large fraction of urban areas compared to the total drainage area of the catchment ii long term flow measurements and iii a relatively small impact of upstream dams for the first criterion we used the national land cover database nlcd homer et al 2015 and considered only the catchments presenting a percentage of areas categorized as developed sum of classes 21 developed open space 22 developed low intensity 23 developed medium intensity and 24 developed high intensity in the nlcd classification greater than 10 of the total catchment drainage area for the second criterion we used the hydrometric stations presenting more than 30 years of data with at least 10 years of data for the 1940 1975 period and 10 years for the 1985 2010 period for the third criterion we used the mean annual volume of water stored in the dams collected in the gages ii database we converted this volume into a mean annual runoff using the catchment area and we divided the runoff by the mean annual runoff finally we considered that a ratio below 0 1 leads to a relatively small impact of dams over the catchment behavior based on these criteria 430 catchments were selected for the analysis but further selection among this set of 430 catchments were made on the basis of the evolution of urbanization during the flow record periods see section 3 2 2 2 hydroclimatic data daily precipitation and air temperature data for each catchment were gathered from the database proposed by livneh et al 2013 they produced gridded meteorological variables spatial resolution 1 16 interpolated from ground based measurements this dataset was created by incorporating daily observations of maximum and minimum temperature as well as accumulated precipitation from national weather service cooperative observer stations across the united states for the 1915 2011 period daily potential evaporation values were estimated from air temperature data of the gridded data set using the equation proposed by oudin et al 2005 2 3 historical urbanization data it was necessary to verify if the urban fraction had indeed evolved significantly over the flow record period to this aim we used the housing density hd maps at a 90 m resolution developed by theobald 2005 as a proxy of urban land cover this allows estimating long term changes in urban areas since hd maps were available from 1940 to 2010 every 10 years while nlcd provides only more recent maps for the years 1992 2001 2006 and 2011 we considered that urban areas were defined by hd above 145 units per km2 table 2 which is higher than the threshold used by theobald 25 units per km2 while showing better agreement with nlcd developed area classes the hd data were reclassified to estimate mean catchment imperviousness tia for each catchment and each decade the rules of classification table 2 were reconsidered from previous studies bierwagen et al 2010 theobald et al 2009 to reach better agreement with nlcd impervious surface estimates xian et al 2011 considered as the land cover benchmark the limitation of estimating urban areas and imperviousness from hd data is that areas of predominately commercial or industrial land use often have high imperviousness but low hd however this land use class is present in the hd maps urban built up class and we considered a 90 corresponding categorical value of imperviousness as mentioned in the introduction urbanization often comes along the settings of sewer systems and wastewater treatment facilities that are likely to impact significantly the river flow regime unfortunately no historical nation wide information exists on rain water sewer system and water treatment facilities while this information should be particularly complementary to imperviousness in an urban context in this study we used the density of major water treatment facilities wtfs extracted from the gage ii database for the year 2006 this metric is used along other landscape patterns as an explanatory variable of estimated flow changes 3 methods 3 1 urban landscape patterns considered based on reclassified hd maps we extracted several indicators of urbanization patterns for each decade to analyze the hydrological impact beyond the usual tia estimate table 3 provides a brief description of these indicators f urb and tia are basic urbanization descriptors describing only the extent and density of urbanization over the catchment si urb and si nurb are landscape fragmentation indices aimed at characterizing the intrinsic structuring of urban areas within the catchment rdist net rdist out and imp 100 distribution of the imperviousness of areas in a 100 m buffer area from the hydrographic network aim at characterizing the location of urban areas within the catchment in particular their proximity to the drainage network and or the outlet all these variables depend on the resolution of the data used since hd data are at a 90 m resolution landscape structuring metrics such as the shape indexes will not take into account small parks and private gardens but they will provide an overview of urban and suburban areas over the catchment for the metrics related to the hydrographic network rdist net and imp 100 we used the high resolution national hydrography dataset nhd and considered only stream rivers flagged as perennial or intermittent i e omitting ephemeral rivers for some catchments the hydrographic network had been largely modified by urbanization and historic data are difficult to obtain at this resolution consequently artificial network data pipelines and ditches that may be identified by the nhd database were not considered in the rdist net and imp 100 estimation 3 2 quantifying the hydrological impact of urbanization through hydrological modeling in this study we applied the model residual approach to quantify the historical impact of urbanization on different flow components kuczera et al 1993 seibert and mcdonnell 2010 the model residual approach is a widely used approach to determine the impact of land use change on hydrology see e g li et al 2012 in the context of urbanization it was compared to the paired catchment approach and both approaches were in general in good agreements salavati et al 2016 the model residual approach basically consists in calibrating a rainfall runoff model on a time period before a land use change and simulating flow with this set of calibrated parameters on the time period after land use changes analysis of the model residual for the time period after land use changes allows assessing the impact of land use change on streamflow at the outlet of the catchment the main advantage of the model residual approach is that it allows separating and quantifying the effects of land use change and climate variability climate change provided that the calibration of the model for the period before land use change is robust to apply the model residual approach we followed the following steps for each catchment i determination of a preurbanization period and a posturbanization period ii calibration of the hydrological model on the preurbanization period iii simulation of streamflow on the posturbanization period using the parameter set obtained in calibration on the preurbanization period iv quantification of flow changes each of these steps are detailed hereafter the preurbanization period was defined as the first 15 years of the streamflow record period while the last 10 years of the streamflow record period were used as the posturbanization period the record lengths of these subperiods were chosen since they allow to reach a reasonable trade off between two objectives i the periods needed to be long enough to provide robust calibration of model parameters for the preurbanization period and significant simulation results for the posturbanization period and ii the periods needed to be short enough so that limited land use changes occurred during these two subperiods while important urbanization gradients existed between preurbanization and posturbanization periods the stationarity of the preurbanization period was assessed in terms of both hydrological model parameter values and urbanization extent besides we restricted the analysis on the catchments for which mean imperviousness had increased by more than 5 between the preurbanization period and the posturbanization period the daily rainfall runoff model with four parameters gr4j perrin et al 2003 coupled with the cemaneige snow model valéry et al 2014a 2014b was calibrated on the preurbanization period the association of the gr4j model with a snow module fig 1 was necessary since the influence of snow accumulation and snowmelt is not negligible on many of the catchments studied the model calibration was based on a local search algorithm including a steepest descent variable as used by edijatno et al 1999 and the objective function was the kling gupta efficiency criterion gupta et al 2009 applied to root squared streamflow then streamflow for the record period was simulated using the set of parameters calibrated on the preurbanization period the first 15 years of the record period therefore the simulated discharge is likely to represent the discharge that would have occurred in the urban catchment if urbanization had not expanded thus the differences between the simulated and observed discharges for the posturbanization period the last 10 years of the record period are attributed to the effect of urbanization change on the hydrologic response three flow characteristics were analyzed in this study the mean annual flow qma allows investigating the impact of urbanization on the catchment s water balance annual low flow q05 and high flow q95 characteristics were also computed to investigate the impact of urbanization on extreme flow values q05 and q95 represent the daily discharges that were exceeded during 95 and 5 of each year of the record period respectively to quantify the changes for the three annual flow components we computed the change based on differences between the regression equations obtained for pre and posturbanization periods at a specific flow value corresponding to the mean of the observed flow characteristic over the whole record period salavati et al 2016 the equation used to determine the absolute flow change takes the general form of eq 1 1 cq e post q obs q sim q obs e pre q obs q sim q obs where cq is the absolute flow change for a given flow characteristic q05 q95 or qma e post and e pre are the linear regressed models between the annual observed flow characteristic the dependent variable and simulated flow characteristic the explanatory variable for the preurbanization period and the posturbanization period respectively and q obs is the mean of observed annual flow characteristics over the entire record period consequently e post q obs q sim q obs and e pre q obs q sim q obs represent the regressed values of qobs for the specific value of q obs using the linear models e post and e pre respectively since the hydroclimatic settings of the catchments are quite diverse relative changes are shown instead of absolute changes by dividing the absolute change by the mean annual flow characteristics for the preurbanization period as the mean annual q05 can be very close to zero for some catchments the relative q05 change is expressed as a percentage of mean annual flow i e the absolute q05 change is divided by the mean annual flow of the preurbanization period 3 3 relating the hydrological impact of urbanization to urban landscape patterns to relate flow changes to urban landscape change we considered absolute differences between the posturbanization period and preurbanization period for all urban landscape variables except rdist net and rdist out for which only the new urban pixels were used to compute the metric therefore the notations used hereafter to describe the evolution of urban landscape patterns are d f urb d tia d si urb d si nurb rdist net rdist out and d imp 100 for rdist net and rdist out the differences between the metrics for the pre and posturbanization periods were biased by the differences in terms of urban extent to focus on the locations of urban sprawl between the two periods we computed rdist net and rdist out by considering only the areas that were changed from rural to urban between the two periods besides the density of major wastewater treatment facilities for the year 2006 was used as a complementary explanatory variable for each of the three flow variables q05 q95 and qma separate analyses were performed streamflow change detections were calculated for each urban catchment for the pre and posturbanization record period from the set of independent variables backward stepwise regression was used to identify the best linear models using the bayesian information criterion bic which was preferred to the akaike information criterion aic since it tends to identify less parametrized models the regression model was fit between the dependent variables the change of one of the three flow components and the changes of the selected urban catchment characteristics as the independent variables regression equations take the general form of eq 2 2 cq i β 0 β 1 x 1 i β 2 x 2 i β n x n i where cq i is the streamflow change for the i th catchment x j i is the change of the j th urbanization catchment characteristic of the i th catchment and β j are the linear model coefficients since three flow characteristics were analyzed three regression equations were obtained from the selected models we performed hierarchical partitioning to assess the relative contribution of each predictor within the r environment software using the hier part package walsh and mac nally 2003 4 results 4 1 catchment urbanization patterns to assess the potential of using hd data as a proxy for imperviousness we estimated the urban fraction and catchment imperviousness i e tia using the lookup table 2 for each catchment for the year 2010 and compared it to data given by nlcd database for the year 2011 since nlcd is considered as the reference database fig 2 shows that hd data satisfactorily estimated the fraction of urban areas and mean catchment imperviousness the fraction of urban areas estimated by hd is generally underestimated compared to the nlcd database while mean catchment imperviousness is slightly overestimated for those catchments presenting low tia values overall the correlation coefficients for both the fraction of urban areas and mean catchment imperviousness are above 0 96 corroborating the results of previous studies that used hd data to derive urban fractions over et al 2016 the slight biases observed are probably due to the choice of the classes of the original hd dataset table 2 and more classes around the urban nonurban threshold and in the upper values of hd would probably provide better agreement between hd estimates and nlcd products to investigate whether the urban fraction had evolved significantly between the preurbanization period and the posturbanization period and among the preurbanization period we used the hd maps that were available from 1940 to 2010 every 10 years for each catchment we used three hd maps representative of the preurbanization and the posturbanization periods a map characterizing the beginning of the preurbanization period for this map we selected the closest decade to the beginning of the preurbanization period a map characterizing the end of the preurbanization period for this map we selected the closest decade to the end of the preurbanization period and a map characterizing the posturbanization period for this map we selected the closest decade to the end of the posturbanization period the first two maps are used to investigate possible evolution of urbanization during the preurbanization period and the first and third maps are used to assess the evolution of urbanization between the preurbanization period and the posturbanization period the urban catchment characteristics listed in were calculated for these representative maps and tia evolution was analyzed in order to check whether the selected catchments changed significantly in terms of urbanization over the flow record period and within the preurbanization period it is noteworthy that tia evolution was computed as the absolute difference between tia for the posturbanization period and tia for the preurbanization period i e a 5 increase of tia between the two periods means that tia had increased by 5 of the catchment area fig 3 notably shows that for many catchments the increase of mean catchment imperviousness over the flow record period is low the urban catchments were initially selected based on the fraction of urban areas given by nlcd for the year 2011 and many of the catchments selected were already urbanized at the beginning of the flow record period only 209 catchments presented an evolution of tia greater than 5 between the preurbanization period and the posturbanization period besides the evolution of tia during the preurbanization period is generally low but greater than 5 for 50 catchments since we aimed at relating the hydrological changes to the urbanization patterns over the catchment set we decided to focus on the catchments for which mean imperviousness had increased by more than 5 between the preurbanization and posturbanization periods while presenting low 5 evolution of tia within the preurbanization period this leads to a reduction of the catchment set from 430 to 142 catchments see location on fig 4 with drainage areas ranging from 10 to 7000 km2 and a median value of 150 km2 the distributions of the seven urban catchment characteristics listed in table 3 are shown in fig 5 for the 142 selected catchments the distributions of the fraction of urban areas f urb and the mean catchment imperviousness tia are relatively similar which is expected since the two metrics are highly correlated with each other the distributions of both f urb and tia are also similar to the distribution of the imperviousness of areas in a 100 m buffer area from the hydrographic network imp 100 meaning that urbanization led to increased imperviousness relatively homogeneously at the catchment scale and in the vicinity of hydrographic network fragmentation of the nonurban landscape si nurb is generally increased but some catchments present decreased nonurban fragmentation fragmentation of the urban landscape si urb is either increased or decreased depending on the catchments considered meaning that urban development can be either concentrated or scattered over the catchment area this also stems from urban sprawl taking place in the vicinity of already urban areas for some catchments while for other catchments new urban areas disconnected from urban areas already present emerged the distributions of the distance ratio of urban areas to the hydrographic network rdist net shows that urban areas are not necessarily located in the vicinity of the hydrographic network rdist net generally above 1 and for a majority of the catchments new urban areas are relatively far from the hydrographic network delta of rdist net above 1 for 70 of the 142 catchments the distributions of the distance ratio of urban areas to catchment outlets rdist out show that urban areas are not preferentially located close to or far from the catchment outlet but a wide variety of situations exists to conclude on these urbanization characteristics the set of 142 catchments present a wide variety of urbanization patterns in terms of quantity and spatial structuring within the catchment area this diversity offers the opportunity to analyze the change of streamflow with regards to these diverse urbanization characteristics fig 6 provides an illustration of the diversity of urbanization patterns for a similar extent of urban areas from around 5 of the catchment area in 1940 to around 18 in 2010 urban areas are more fragmented on the quinnipiac river shape index si urb 21 and 23 for 1940 and 2010 respectively compared to the whippany river shape index si urb 8 and 11 for 1940 and 2010 respectively similarly nonurban areas are more fragmented on the quinnipiac river shape index si nurb 6 and 12 for 1940 and 2010 respectively compared to the whippany river shape index si nurb 3 and 6 for 1940 and 2010 respectively the differences of these indexes for the posturbanization and preurbanization periods point out that urbanization leads to more fragmented nonurban areas over the quinnipiac river at wallingford 4 2 assessment of hydrological model calibration on the preurbanization period since the estimated flow changes are based on the model s ability to simulate the low urbanization configuration of the catchments we analyzed the calibration results of the hydrological model using four criteria the first criterion is the kling gupta efficiency criterion applied to root squared streamflow which is also used as the objective function during the optimization process of the model parameters the three other criteria aimed at assessing the ability of the model to simulate the three streamflow characteristics q05 q95 and qma calculated at the annual time scale since the quantification of the hydrological impact of urbanization is based on the changes of the linear relationships between simulated and observed annual flow characteristics we used the coefficients of determination r2 of these relationships fig 7 shows that daily streamflows are generally well simulated by the hydrological model 75 of kge values above 0 84 mean annual flow values are also well represented 75 of the r2 qma above 0 76 while high and low flow percentiles are more difficult to reproduce 75 of the r2 q95 above 0 64 and 75 of r2 q05 above 0 27 one may argue that this results from the choice of the objective function but using another objective function dedicated to low flows e g kge on log transformed flows does not improve r2 q05 since it mainly reduces the model s bias on low flows while only marginally improving the explained variance of the annual q05 samples for the sake of homogeneity of the model simulations we kept a single objective function for simulating the three streamflow characteristics the model s low level of efficiency in simulating low flows and to a lesser extent high flows is inherent to hydrological model but poses the question of the reliability of model simulations for the calibration period i e the period before urbanization extended and for the simulation period i e the period after urbanization extended however the linear relationships obtained between annual flow characteristics are in general significant at a 0 01 threshold p value 107 out of 142 for q05 139 out of 142 for q95 and 140 out of 142 for qma another caveat of the model residual approach is the parameter uncertainty issue to address this issue we tested the robustness of the model calibration during the preurbanization by applying a split sample test over this period the model is calibrated on the first seven years and test in validation mode over the last seven years and vice versa fig 8 compares the model performance for the model calibration and validation periods the performance is assessed by the objective function used for calibration kling gupta efficiency criterion on root squared transformed daily flow median kling gupta efficiency on square rooted streamflow over the catchment set is 0 87 and 0 88 during calibration first and last seven years respectively and 0 83 and 0 84 during validation first and last seven years respectively the gap between calibration and validation results is relatively small and comparable with other large sample studies with this hydrological model poncelet et al 2017 this suggests that model calibration is relatively robust in between the preurbanization period making the model residual approach appropriate for our study 4 3 analysis of the hydrological impacts of catchment imperviousness fig 9 provides an overview of the relative flow changes estimated over the 142 urban catchments considered with respect to the total imperviousness increase over the flow record period the impact of the imperviousness increase is clear for high and mean flow an increase of tia in most cases led to an increase of flow which is however diverse over the catchment set it is noteworthy that a relatively low tia increase less than around 10 does not affect the flow characteristics considered this result corroborates a number of previous studies pointing out a threshold value of imperviousness above which the hydrological impacts of urbanization become significant the threshold value reported in the literature is generally between 5 booth and jackson 1997 yang et al 2010 and 20 brun and band 2000 and the 10 value obtained over the set of 142 catchments lies between these reported values as for the low flow characteristic the estimated changes also appear greater for larger tia increases but the sign of the changes can be either negative or positive depending on the catchment this means that the q05 response to urbanization is complex and the tia increase might not be the best variable to explain alone the low flow changes on some catchments 4 4 influence of urban landscape patterns on hydrological impacts to shed more light on the landscape patterns affecting most flow characteristics on the 142 catchments studied this section relates the relative flow changes to the changes in urban landscape patterns the explanatory variables tested that were used for the regression analysis were initially the absolute differences between the preurbanization and posturbanization periods of the metrics presented in table 3 since d f urb d tia and d imp 100 presented a quite high cross correlation above 0 95 only d tia is used hereafter in addition we used the density of major facilities wtfs extracted from the gage ii database for the year 2006 the hierarchical partitioning fig 10 revealed that the density of major wtfs presents the highest independent contribution in low flow changes 71 but also a high contribution in high and mean flow changes 23 and 45 respectively the increase of mean catchment imperviousness d tia presents the highest independent contribution to high flow changes 40 and also has a high contribution to mean flow changes 22 the evolution of the fragmentation of urban areas d si urb presents a relatively high contribution to high and mean flow changes 28 and 25 respectively finally the metrics characterizing the distance of urban areas from the hydrographic network or catchment outlet present a low contribution to all flow changes this means either that the location of urban areas has a second order importance or that the metrics used are not appropriate to describe the connectivity of urban areas to the hydrographic network regression modeling also demonstrated the high influence of wastewater treatment facilities on flow changes table 4 the models indicate that a higher number of wtfs indicating greater density of water treatment facilities is associated with increased flows the catchment imperviousness variation d tia is also selected for all flow characteristics it demonstrated a positive relationship with high and mean flow but a negative relationship with low flow this paradoxical effect of imperviousness on flow changes might be due to increased surface flow and decreased baseflow within the urbanized catchment even if the presence of wtfs may offset the decreased low flow due to imperviousness for some catchments fragmentation metrics were also included in the best linear models the shape index of urban areas shows a negative relationship with flow change meaning that more fragmented or less concentrated urban landscapes are associated with a lower impact on flow change contrary to imperviousness the variation of fragmentation is homogenously associated with flow changes finally as suggested by the hierarchical analysis shown before the metrics associated with the proximity of urban areas to the hydrographic network are marginally selected only the distance of new urban areas is included in the best models for high and mean flow the negative relationship indicates that a development of urban areas near the catchment outlet i e shorter distance is associated with greater flow changes 5 discussion and conclusion this study attempted to draw general conclusions on the hydrological impact of urbanization at the catchment scale to this aim the derived methodology is based on a hydrological modeling framework to minimize the flow change attributed to climate variability the choice of a relatively simple and somewhat parametrized conceptual rainfall runoff model enabled us to apply the same methodology to a wide range of catchments with several hydroclimatic settings and with diverse levels of urban sprawl this choice was also warranted because the model is not used to simulate the changes of hydrological processes within the catchment but to simulate the streamflow that would have occurred without urbanization the results shed new light on several common questions on the impact of urbanization an imperviousness threshold effect on the impact of urbanization was observed this threshold reflects an approximately 10 increase in mean catchment imperviousness tia and affects the three flow characteristics studied q05 q95 and qma this threshold is in agreement with other studies conducted on a more limited number of catchments e g booth and jackson 1997 yang et al 2010 however at this stage it is difficult to conclude definitively on this threshold value does the catchment buffer urbanization up to this threshold or does the lack of significant impacts detected below this threshold reflect the undeniable uncertainties related to the hydrological modeling framework it is more likely that above a 10 increase in mean catchment imperviousness the hydrological impacts of urbanization overtake the modeling uncertainties another question raised in the literature is the common effect of urbanization on flow characteristics among urbanized catchments the literature generally reports that urbanization increases high flow which was also observed clearly on the catchments studied the observation was similar for mean annual flow since a large majority of the urbanized catchment presented positive flow changes concerning low flow the results obtained in this study reflect the diversity of the results reported in previous studies since the catchment set studied shows both increased and decreased low flows therefore the effect of urbanization seems relatively common to all catchments for high and mean flows but highly variable for low flows another issue addressed in this study is the role of the spatial organization of urban areas on the hydrological impact of urbanization over the landscape patterns analyzed in this study mean catchment imperviousness tia was indeed a key variable but other relevant metrics can help understand the variability of the impacts of urbanization it was shown that the fragmentation of urban areas presents a negative relationship with flow changes suggesting that the fragmentation of urban areas mitigates the impacts of urbanization interestingly considering several landscape metrics better identifies the role of mean catchment imperviousness since a positive relationship was found for high and mean flow whereas a negative one was found for low flows suggesting that all things being equal increased imperviousness decreases low flows and increases high flows the prominence of the density of major wastewater treatment facilities in the best linear models raises the issue of compensation of the effects of imperviousness and the development of water treatment facilities to investigate the sole impact of urban landscape patterns on low flow it would be interesting to focus on urban catchments with no major water treatment facilities or to take explicitly into account flow from water treatment facilities unfortunately the catchment set used here did not allow this further analysis and a study focusing on a smaller catchment set would probably be more appropriate to obtain the data to perform this analysis another hypothesis of this study that was not verified given the large catchment set is that urbanization may be the dominant change over the catchment during the record period the results obtained suggest that this hypothesis might be valid for a majority of catchments but a more detailed assessment of historical changes over the catchments in terms of land use and land cover as well as in terms of hydrographic and sewer networks should ideally be examined acknowledgments the funding for this study came from the

7418,the impacts of urbanization on floods droughts and the overall river regime have been largely investigated in the past few decades but the quantification and the prediction of such impacts still remain a challenge in hydrology we gathered a sample of 142 catchments that have a documented increase in urban areas over the hydrometeorological record period in the united states the changes in river flow regimes due to urban spread were differentiated from climate variability using the gr4j conceptual hydrological model high low and mean flows were impacted at a threshold of a 10 total impervious area moreover the historical evolution of urban landscape spatial patterns was used to further detail the urbanization process in terms of extent and fragmentation of urban areas throughout the catchment and to help interpret the divergent impacts observed in streamflow behaviors regression analysis pointed out the importance of major wastewater treatment facilities that might overpass the effects of imperviousness and therefore further research should either take them explicitly into account or select a wastewater facility free catchment sample to clearly evaluate the impacts of urban landscape on low flows keywords rainfall runoff modeling urban fragmentation total imperviousness threshold effect urbanization impacts 1 introduction 1 1 urban transformation of river landscapes in a global context today 54 of the world s population lives in urban areas a proportion that is expected to increase to 66 by 2050 united nations 2014 the environmental impacts of such an increase will certainly be huge but many facets of this impact remain difficult to assess the hydrological impact of urbanization while largely studied for more than 50 years see e g leopold 1968 is very difficult to predict and even the quantification of this impact for historical urban sprawl appears difficult to assess this is quite a problem since recent urban planning or mitigation strategies could be particularly useful in the near future and often involve the restoration of what is assumed to be natural hydrological conditions trinh and chui 2013 1 2 identifying and quantifying the impact of urbanization on catchment response local hydrological processes can be deeply modified in urban settings the development of impervious areas alters surface infiltration of water resulting in increased surface runoff and decreased evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge see the recent review by salvadore et al 2015 at the catchment scale typically 10 10000 km2 due to the high spatial heterogeneity of impervious areas the hydrological impact of urbanization is more complex table 1 provides an overview of previous studies that investigate the hydrological impact of urbanization at the catchment scale this synthesis focuses on studieswith observed streamflow data along spatial or temporal gradients of urbanization therefore studies based only on simulation of hydrological models without observations typically simulations performed on land use scenario were not included it appears from table 1 that diverse impacts were reported depending on the flow characteristics investigated while the increase in the peak streamflow of flood events is supported by both empirical and modeling studies the amount of change in high flows is highly variable among studies increased catchment imperviousness reduces soil infiltration and consequently baseflow which may decrease low flows at the outlet of the catchment kauffman et al 2009 however other factors might mitigate or emphasize the impact on low flows reduced evaporation from urban areas compared to other land covers rose and peters 2001 modifications of soil permeability due to topographic modification and soil compaction e g hibbs and sharp 2012 in addition discharge from wastewater treatment facilities e g göbel et al 2004 inter basin water transfer e g barringer et al 1994 and or groundwater pumping e g claessens et al 2006 often occur on urban catchments and may impact the entire flow range most particularly low flows consequently there is no consensus on the impact of urbanization on catchment low flows that may either increase or decrease bhaskar et al 2015 the impact of urbanization on mean annual flows is complex as a result of the multiple factors described above previous studies point out that mean annual flow is either unimpacted e g rose and peters 2001 or increased e g dewalle et al 2000 1 3 relating the hydrological impact on urban landscapes the imperviousness of the catchment has become a benchmark for urban design and zoning criteria arnold and gibbons 1996 schueler et al 2009 at the catchment scale imperviousness is often calculated as the area weighted mean of land use categories with categorical imperviousness values mean catchment imperviousness also referred to as total imperviousness area tia is often suggested to explain the hydrological impact of urbanization diverse mean catchment imperviousness threshold values above which hydrological characteristics are modified have been put forward some authors reported significant effects of urbanization at a very low level 5 of imperviousness booth and jackson 1997 yang et al 2010 while others observed very small changes up to 20 brun and band 2000 this wide range of imperviousness threshold values suggests that the total imperviousness of a catchment cannot explain all of the diversity of the hydrological impacts of urbanization the total imperviousness area is probably a relevant first order aggregated measure but might overlook other relevant explanatory factors alberti et al 2007 that mitigate and in some cases offset the impact of increased imperviousness these factors are diverse and include the location of the impervious area within the catchment mejía and moglen 2010a in particular its interconnectedness mejía and moglen 2010b and its proximity to the drainage network grove et al 1998 sheeder et al 2002 as well as the development of hydraulic structures such as detention basins and natural pathway modifications ogden et al 2011 in addition to the natural geomorphological settings of the catchment such as the catchment area the hydrographic network drainage density and the presence of aquifers konrad et al 2005 so far few studies have attempted to empirically quantify the effects of these urban land patterns on hydrological catchment behavior 1 4 scope of the paper the objective of this study was to determine whether general conclusions can be drawn on the impact of urbanization on the flow characteristics at the outlet of urbanized catchments to this aim a hydrological model was used to quantify the historical change of streamflow characteristics mean flow low flow and high flow due to urbanization and distinguish it from the change due to climate variability then the change of streamflow characteristics is related to modifications of urban landscape metrics within a regression framework in order to hierarchize the impacts of land use management to determine flow changes attributable to land use changes and not climate variability we followed in this paper the so called model residual approach which was found to give comparable results to the paired catchment approach on a set of 24 urban catchments salavati et al 2016 the present study was conducted on 142 u s urban catchments in order to reach general conclusions on several open questions is there a threshold effect of imperviousness on the impact of urbanization is the effect of urbanization common to all catchments does urbanization affect low mean and high flows differently does the spatial organization of urban areas play a significant role on the impact of urbanization at the catchment scale 2 data 2 1 catchment selection the catchments studied were selected among the 9067 catchments of the gages ii database a preliminary selection was made according to the following criteria i a relatively large fraction of urban areas compared to the total drainage area of the catchment ii long term flow measurements and iii a relatively small impact of upstream dams for the first criterion we used the national land cover database nlcd homer et al 2015 and considered only the catchments presenting a percentage of areas categorized as developed sum of classes 21 developed open space 22 developed low intensity 23 developed medium intensity and 24 developed high intensity in the nlcd classification greater than 10 of the total catchment drainage area for the second criterion we used the hydrometric stations presenting more than 30 years of data with at least 10 years of data for the 1940 1975 period and 10 years for the 1985 2010 period for the third criterion we used the mean annual volume of water stored in the dams collected in the gages ii database we converted this volume into a mean annual runoff using the catchment area and we divided the runoff by the mean annual runoff finally we considered that a ratio below 0 1 leads to a relatively small impact of dams over the catchment behavior based on these criteria 430 catchments were selected for the analysis but further selection among this set of 430 catchments were made on the basis of the evolution of urbanization during the flow record periods see section 3 2 2 2 hydroclimatic data daily precipitation and air temperature data for each catchment were gathered from the database proposed by livneh et al 2013 they produced gridded meteorological variables spatial resolution 1 16 interpolated from ground based measurements this dataset was created by incorporating daily observations of maximum and minimum temperature as well as accumulated precipitation from national weather service cooperative observer stations across the united states for the 1915 2011 period daily potential evaporation values were estimated from air temperature data of the gridded data set using the equation proposed by oudin et al 2005 2 3 historical urbanization data it was necessary to verify if the urban fraction had indeed evolved significantly over the flow record period to this aim we used the housing density hd maps at a 90 m resolution developed by theobald 2005 as a proxy of urban land cover this allows estimating long term changes in urban areas since hd maps were available from 1940 to 2010 every 10 years while nlcd provides only more recent maps for the years 1992 2001 2006 and 2011 we considered that urban areas were defined by hd above 145 units per km2 table 2 which is higher than the threshold used by theobald 25 units per km2 while showing better agreement with nlcd developed area classes the hd data were reclassified to estimate mean catchment imperviousness tia for each catchment and each decade the rules of classification table 2 were reconsidered from previous studies bierwagen et al 2010 theobald et al 2009 to reach better agreement with nlcd impervious surface estimates xian et al 2011 considered as the land cover benchmark the limitation of estimating urban areas and imperviousness from hd data is that areas of predominately commercial or industrial land use often have high imperviousness but low hd however this land use class is present in the hd maps urban built up class and we considered a 90 corresponding categorical value of imperviousness as mentioned in the introduction urbanization often comes along the settings of sewer systems and wastewater treatment facilities that are likely to impact significantly the river flow regime unfortunately no historical nation wide information exists on rain water sewer system and water treatment facilities while this information should be particularly complementary to imperviousness in an urban context in this study we used the density of major water treatment facilities wtfs extracted from the gage ii database for the year 2006 this metric is used along other landscape patterns as an explanatory variable of estimated flow changes 3 methods 3 1 urban landscape patterns considered based on reclassified hd maps we extracted several indicators of urbanization patterns for each decade to analyze the hydrological impact beyond the usual tia estimate table 3 provides a brief description of these indicators f urb and tia are basic urbanization descriptors describing only the extent and density of urbanization over the catchment si urb and si nurb are landscape fragmentation indices aimed at characterizing the intrinsic structuring of urban areas within the catchment rdist net rdist out and imp 100 distribution of the imperviousness of areas in a 100 m buffer area from the hydrographic network aim at characterizing the location of urban areas within the catchment in particular their proximity to the drainage network and or the outlet all these variables depend on the resolution of the data used since hd data are at a 90 m resolution landscape structuring metrics such as the shape indexes will not take into account small parks and private gardens but they will provide an overview of urban and suburban areas over the catchment for the metrics related to the hydrographic network rdist net and imp 100 we used the high resolution national hydrography dataset nhd and considered only stream rivers flagged as perennial or intermittent i e omitting ephemeral rivers for some catchments the hydrographic network had been largely modified by urbanization and historic data are difficult to obtain at this resolution consequently artificial network data pipelines and ditches that may be identified by the nhd database were not considered in the rdist net and imp 100 estimation 3 2 quantifying the hydrological impact of urbanization through hydrological modeling in this study we applied the model residual approach to quantify the historical impact of urbanization on different flow components kuczera et al 1993 seibert and mcdonnell 2010 the model residual approach is a widely used approach to determine the impact of land use change on hydrology see e g li et al 2012 in the context of urbanization it was compared to the paired catchment approach and both approaches were in general in good agreements salavati et al 2016 the model residual approach basically consists in calibrating a rainfall runoff model on a time period before a land use change and simulating flow with this set of calibrated parameters on the time period after land use changes analysis of the model residual for the time period after land use changes allows assessing the impact of land use change on streamflow at the outlet of the catchment the main advantage of the model residual approach is that it allows separating and quantifying the effects of land use change and climate variability climate change provided that the calibration of the model for the period before land use change is robust to apply the model residual approach we followed the following steps for each catchment i determination of a preurbanization period and a posturbanization period ii calibration of the hydrological model on the preurbanization period iii simulation of streamflow on the posturbanization period using the parameter set obtained in calibration on the preurbanization period iv quantification of flow changes each of these steps are detailed hereafter the preurbanization period was defined as the first 15 years of the streamflow record period while the last 10 years of the streamflow record period were used as the posturbanization period the record lengths of these subperiods were chosen since they allow to reach a reasonable trade off between two objectives i the periods needed to be long enough to provide robust calibration of model parameters for the preurbanization period and significant simulation results for the posturbanization period and ii the periods needed to be short enough so that limited land use changes occurred during these two subperiods while important urbanization gradients existed between preurbanization and posturbanization periods the stationarity of the preurbanization period was assessed in terms of both hydrological model parameter values and urbanization extent besides we restricted the analysis on the catchments for which mean imperviousness had increased by more than 5 between the preurbanization period and the posturbanization period the daily rainfall runoff model with four parameters gr4j perrin et al 2003 coupled with the cemaneige snow model valéry et al 2014a 2014b was calibrated on the preurbanization period the association of the gr4j model with a snow module fig 1 was necessary since the influence of snow accumulation and snowmelt is not negligible on many of the catchments studied the model calibration was based on a local search algorithm including a steepest descent variable as used by edijatno et al 1999 and the objective function was the kling gupta efficiency criterion gupta et al 2009 applied to root squared streamflow then streamflow for the record period was simulated using the set of parameters calibrated on the preurbanization period the first 15 years of the record period therefore the simulated discharge is likely to represent the discharge that would have occurred in the urban catchment if urbanization had not expanded thus the differences between the simulated and observed discharges for the posturbanization period the last 10 years of the record period are attributed to the effect of urbanization change on the hydrologic response three flow characteristics were analyzed in this study the mean annual flow qma allows investigating the impact of urbanization on the catchment s water balance annual low flow q05 and high flow q95 characteristics were also computed to investigate the impact of urbanization on extreme flow values q05 and q95 represent the daily discharges that were exceeded during 95 and 5 of each year of the record period respectively to quantify the changes for the three annual flow components we computed the change based on differences between the regression equations obtained for pre and posturbanization periods at a specific flow value corresponding to the mean of the observed flow characteristic over the whole record period salavati et al 2016 the equation used to determine the absolute flow change takes the general form of eq 1 1 cq e post q obs q sim q obs e pre q obs q sim q obs where cq is the absolute flow change for a given flow characteristic q05 q95 or qma e post and e pre are the linear regressed models between the annual observed flow characteristic the dependent variable and simulated flow characteristic the explanatory variable for the preurbanization period and the posturbanization period respectively and q obs is the mean of observed annual flow characteristics over the entire record period consequently e post q obs q sim q obs and e pre q obs q sim q obs represent the regressed values of qobs for the specific value of q obs using the linear models e post and e pre respectively since the hydroclimatic settings of the catchments are quite diverse relative changes are shown instead of absolute changes by dividing the absolute change by the mean annual flow characteristics for the preurbanization period as the mean annual q05 can be very close to zero for some catchments the relative q05 change is expressed as a percentage of mean annual flow i e the absolute q05 change is divided by the mean annual flow of the preurbanization period 3 3 relating the hydrological impact of urbanization to urban landscape patterns to relate flow changes to urban landscape change we considered absolute differences between the posturbanization period and preurbanization period for all urban landscape variables except rdist net and rdist out for which only the new urban pixels were used to compute the metric therefore the notations used hereafter to describe the evolution of urban landscape patterns are d f urb d tia d si urb d si nurb rdist net rdist out and d imp 100 for rdist net and rdist out the differences between the metrics for the pre and posturbanization periods were biased by the differences in terms of urban extent to focus on the locations of urban sprawl between the two periods we computed rdist net and rdist out by considering only the areas that were changed from rural to urban between the two periods besides the density of major wastewater treatment facilities for the year 2006 was used as a complementary explanatory variable for each of the three flow variables q05 q95 and qma separate analyses were performed streamflow change detections were calculated for each urban catchment for the pre and posturbanization record period from the set of independent variables backward stepwise regression was used to identify the best linear models using the bayesian information criterion bic which was preferred to the akaike information criterion aic since it tends to identify less parametrized models the regression model was fit between the dependent variables the change of one of the three flow components and the changes of the selected urban catchment characteristics as the independent variables regression equations take the general form of eq 2 2 cq i β 0 β 1 x 1 i β 2 x 2 i β n x n i where cq i is the streamflow change for the i th catchment x j i is the change of the j th urbanization catchment characteristic of the i th catchment and β j are the linear model coefficients since three flow characteristics were analyzed three regression equations were obtained from the selected models we performed hierarchical partitioning to assess the relative contribution of each predictor within the r environment software using the hier part package walsh and mac nally 2003 4 results 4 1 catchment urbanization patterns to assess the potential of using hd data as a proxy for imperviousness we estimated the urban fraction and catchment imperviousness i e tia using the lookup table 2 for each catchment for the year 2010 and compared it to data given by nlcd database for the year 2011 since nlcd is considered as the reference database fig 2 shows that hd data satisfactorily estimated the fraction of urban areas and mean catchment imperviousness the fraction of urban areas estimated by hd is generally underestimated compared to the nlcd database while mean catchment imperviousness is slightly overestimated for those catchments presenting low tia values overall the correlation coefficients for both the fraction of urban areas and mean catchment imperviousness are above 0 96 corroborating the results of previous studies that used hd data to derive urban fractions over et al 2016 the slight biases observed are probably due to the choice of the classes of the original hd dataset table 2 and more classes around the urban nonurban threshold and in the upper values of hd would probably provide better agreement between hd estimates and nlcd products to investigate whether the urban fraction had evolved significantly between the preurbanization period and the posturbanization period and among the preurbanization period we used the hd maps that were available from 1940 to 2010 every 10 years for each catchment we used three hd maps representative of the preurbanization and the posturbanization periods a map characterizing the beginning of the preurbanization period for this map we selected the closest decade to the beginning of the preurbanization period a map characterizing the end of the preurbanization period for this map we selected the closest decade to the end of the preurbanization period and a map characterizing the posturbanization period for this map we selected the closest decade to the end of the posturbanization period the first two maps are used to investigate possible evolution of urbanization during the preurbanization period and the first and third maps are used to assess the evolution of urbanization between the preurbanization period and the posturbanization period the urban catchment characteristics listed in were calculated for these representative maps and tia evolution was analyzed in order to check whether the selected catchments changed significantly in terms of urbanization over the flow record period and within the preurbanization period it is noteworthy that tia evolution was computed as the absolute difference between tia for the posturbanization period and tia for the preurbanization period i e a 5 increase of tia between the two periods means that tia had increased by 5 of the catchment area fig 3 notably shows that for many catchments the increase of mean catchment imperviousness over the flow record period is low the urban catchments were initially selected based on the fraction of urban areas given by nlcd for the year 2011 and many of the catchments selected were already urbanized at the beginning of the flow record period only 209 catchments presented an evolution of tia greater than 5 between the preurbanization period and the posturbanization period besides the evolution of tia during the preurbanization period is generally low but greater than 5 for 50 catchments since we aimed at relating the hydrological changes to the urbanization patterns over the catchment set we decided to focus on the catchments for which mean imperviousness had increased by more than 5 between the preurbanization and posturbanization periods while presenting low 5 evolution of tia within the preurbanization period this leads to a reduction of the catchment set from 430 to 142 catchments see location on fig 4 with drainage areas ranging from 10 to 7000 km2 and a median value of 150 km2 the distributions of the seven urban catchment characteristics listed in table 3 are shown in fig 5 for the 142 selected catchments the distributions of the fraction of urban areas f urb and the mean catchment imperviousness tia are relatively similar which is expected since the two metrics are highly correlated with each other the distributions of both f urb and tia are also similar to the distribution of the imperviousness of areas in a 100 m buffer area from the hydrographic network imp 100 meaning that urbanization led to increased imperviousness relatively homogeneously at the catchment scale and in the vicinity of hydrographic network fragmentation of the nonurban landscape si nurb is generally increased but some catchments present decreased nonurban fragmentation fragmentation of the urban landscape si urb is either increased or decreased depending on the catchments considered meaning that urban development can be either concentrated or scattered over the catchment area this also stems from urban sprawl taking place in the vicinity of already urban areas for some catchments while for other catchments new urban areas disconnected from urban areas already present emerged the distributions of the distance ratio of urban areas to the hydrographic network rdist net shows that urban areas are not necessarily located in the vicinity of the hydrographic network rdist net generally above 1 and for a majority of the catchments new urban areas are relatively far from the hydrographic network delta of rdist net above 1 for 70 of the 142 catchments the distributions of the distance ratio of urban areas to catchment outlets rdist out show that urban areas are not preferentially located close to or far from the catchment outlet but a wide variety of situations exists to conclude on these urbanization characteristics the set of 142 catchments present a wide variety of urbanization patterns in terms of quantity and spatial structuring within the catchment area this diversity offers the opportunity to analyze the change of streamflow with regards to these diverse urbanization characteristics fig 6 provides an illustration of the diversity of urbanization patterns for a similar extent of urban areas from around 5 of the catchment area in 1940 to around 18 in 2010 urban areas are more fragmented on the quinnipiac river shape index si urb 21 and 23 for 1940 and 2010 respectively compared to the whippany river shape index si urb 8 and 11 for 1940 and 2010 respectively similarly nonurban areas are more fragmented on the quinnipiac river shape index si nurb 6 and 12 for 1940 and 2010 respectively compared to the whippany river shape index si nurb 3 and 6 for 1940 and 2010 respectively the differences of these indexes for the posturbanization and preurbanization periods point out that urbanization leads to more fragmented nonurban areas over the quinnipiac river at wallingford 4 2 assessment of hydrological model calibration on the preurbanization period since the estimated flow changes are based on the model s ability to simulate the low urbanization configuration of the catchments we analyzed the calibration results of the hydrological model using four criteria the first criterion is the kling gupta efficiency criterion applied to root squared streamflow which is also used as the objective function during the optimization process of the model parameters the three other criteria aimed at assessing the ability of the model to simulate the three streamflow characteristics q05 q95 and qma calculated at the annual time scale since the quantification of the hydrological impact of urbanization is based on the changes of the linear relationships between simulated and observed annual flow characteristics we used the coefficients of determination r2 of these relationships fig 7 shows that daily streamflows are generally well simulated by the hydrological model 75 of kge values above 0 84 mean annual flow values are also well represented 75 of the r2 qma above 0 76 while high and low flow percentiles are more difficult to reproduce 75 of the r2 q95 above 0 64 and 75 of r2 q05 above 0 27 one may argue that this results from the choice of the objective function but using another objective function dedicated to low flows e g kge on log transformed flows does not improve r2 q05 since it mainly reduces the model s bias on low flows while only marginally improving the explained variance of the annual q05 samples for the sake of homogeneity of the model simulations we kept a single objective function for simulating the three streamflow characteristics the model s low level of efficiency in simulating low flows and to a lesser extent high flows is inherent to hydrological model but poses the question of the reliability of model simulations for the calibration period i e the period before urbanization extended and for the simulation period i e the period after urbanization extended however the linear relationships obtained between annual flow characteristics are in general significant at a 0 01 threshold p value 107 out of 142 for q05 139 out of 142 for q95 and 140 out of 142 for qma another caveat of the model residual approach is the parameter uncertainty issue to address this issue we tested the robustness of the model calibration during the preurbanization by applying a split sample test over this period the model is calibrated on the first seven years and test in validation mode over the last seven years and vice versa fig 8 compares the model performance for the model calibration and validation periods the performance is assessed by the objective function used for calibration kling gupta efficiency criterion on root squared transformed daily flow median kling gupta efficiency on square rooted streamflow over the catchment set is 0 87 and 0 88 during calibration first and last seven years respectively and 0 83 and 0 84 during validation first and last seven years respectively the gap between calibration and validation results is relatively small and comparable with other large sample studies with this hydrological model poncelet et al 2017 this suggests that model calibration is relatively robust in between the preurbanization period making the model residual approach appropriate for our study 4 3 analysis of the hydrological impacts of catchment imperviousness fig 9 provides an overview of the relative flow changes estimated over the 142 urban catchments considered with respect to the total imperviousness increase over the flow record period the impact of the imperviousness increase is clear for high and mean flow an increase of tia in most cases led to an increase of flow which is however diverse over the catchment set it is noteworthy that a relatively low tia increase less than around 10 does not affect the flow characteristics considered this result corroborates a number of previous studies pointing out a threshold value of imperviousness above which the hydrological impacts of urbanization become significant the threshold value reported in the literature is generally between 5 booth and jackson 1997 yang et al 2010 and 20 brun and band 2000 and the 10 value obtained over the set of 142 catchments lies between these reported values as for the low flow characteristic the estimated changes also appear greater for larger tia increases but the sign of the changes can be either negative or positive depending on the catchment this means that the q05 response to urbanization is complex and the tia increase might not be the best variable to explain alone the low flow changes on some catchments 4 4 influence of urban landscape patterns on hydrological impacts to shed more light on the landscape patterns affecting most flow characteristics on the 142 catchments studied this section relates the relative flow changes to the changes in urban landscape patterns the explanatory variables tested that were used for the regression analysis were initially the absolute differences between the preurbanization and posturbanization periods of the metrics presented in table 3 since d f urb d tia and d imp 100 presented a quite high cross correlation above 0 95 only d tia is used hereafter in addition we used the density of major facilities wtfs extracted from the gage ii database for the year 2006 the hierarchical partitioning fig 10 revealed that the density of major wtfs presents the highest independent contribution in low flow changes 71 but also a high contribution in high and mean flow changes 23 and 45 respectively the increase of mean catchment imperviousness d tia presents the highest independent contribution to high flow changes 40 and also has a high contribution to mean flow changes 22 the evolution of the fragmentation of urban areas d si urb presents a relatively high contribution to high and mean flow changes 28 and 25 respectively finally the metrics characterizing the distance of urban areas from the hydrographic network or catchment outlet present a low contribution to all flow changes this means either that the location of urban areas has a second order importance or that the metrics used are not appropriate to describe the connectivity of urban areas to the hydrographic network regression modeling also demonstrated the high influence of wastewater treatment facilities on flow changes table 4 the models indicate that a higher number of wtfs indicating greater density of water treatment facilities is associated with increased flows the catchment imperviousness variation d tia is also selected for all flow characteristics it demonstrated a positive relationship with high and mean flow but a negative relationship with low flow this paradoxical effect of imperviousness on flow changes might be due to increased surface flow and decreased baseflow within the urbanized catchment even if the presence of wtfs may offset the decreased low flow due to imperviousness for some catchments fragmentation metrics were also included in the best linear models the shape index of urban areas shows a negative relationship with flow change meaning that more fragmented or less concentrated urban landscapes are associated with a lower impact on flow change contrary to imperviousness the variation of fragmentation is homogenously associated with flow changes finally as suggested by the hierarchical analysis shown before the metrics associated with the proximity of urban areas to the hydrographic network are marginally selected only the distance of new urban areas is included in the best models for high and mean flow the negative relationship indicates that a development of urban areas near the catchment outlet i e shorter distance is associated with greater flow changes 5 discussion and conclusion this study attempted to draw general conclusions on the hydrological impact of urbanization at the catchment scale to this aim the derived methodology is based on a hydrological modeling framework to minimize the flow change attributed to climate variability the choice of a relatively simple and somewhat parametrized conceptual rainfall runoff model enabled us to apply the same methodology to a wide range of catchments with several hydroclimatic settings and with diverse levels of urban sprawl this choice was also warranted because the model is not used to simulate the changes of hydrological processes within the catchment but to simulate the streamflow that would have occurred without urbanization the results shed new light on several common questions on the impact of urbanization an imperviousness threshold effect on the impact of urbanization was observed this threshold reflects an approximately 10 increase in mean catchment imperviousness tia and affects the three flow characteristics studied q05 q95 and qma this threshold is in agreement with other studies conducted on a more limited number of catchments e g booth and jackson 1997 yang et al 2010 however at this stage it is difficult to conclude definitively on this threshold value does the catchment buffer urbanization up to this threshold or does the lack of significant impacts detected below this threshold reflect the undeniable uncertainties related to the hydrological modeling framework it is more likely that above a 10 increase in mean catchment imperviousness the hydrological impacts of urbanization overtake the modeling uncertainties another question raised in the literature is the common effect of urbanization on flow characteristics among urbanized catchments the literature generally reports that urbanization increases high flow which was also observed clearly on the catchments studied the observation was similar for mean annual flow since a large majority of the urbanized catchment presented positive flow changes concerning low flow the results obtained in this study reflect the diversity of the results reported in previous studies since the catchment set studied shows both increased and decreased low flows therefore the effect of urbanization seems relatively common to all catchments for high and mean flows but highly variable for low flows another issue addressed in this study is the role of the spatial organization of urban areas on the hydrological impact of urbanization over the landscape patterns analyzed in this study mean catchment imperviousness tia was indeed a key variable but other relevant metrics can help understand the variability of the impacts of urbanization it was shown that the fragmentation of urban areas presents a negative relationship with flow changes suggesting that the fragmentation of urban areas mitigates the impacts of urbanization interestingly considering several landscape metrics better identifies the role of mean catchment imperviousness since a positive relationship was found for high and mean flow whereas a negative one was found for low flows suggesting that all things being equal increased imperviousness decreases low flows and increases high flows the prominence of the density of major wastewater treatment facilities in the best linear models raises the issue of compensation of the effects of imperviousness and the development of water treatment facilities to investigate the sole impact of urban landscape patterns on low flow it would be interesting to focus on urban catchments with no major water treatment facilities or to take explicitly into account flow from water treatment facilities unfortunately the catchment set used here did not allow this further analysis and a study focusing on a smaller catchment set would probably be more appropriate to obtain the data to perform this analysis another hypothesis of this study that was not verified given the large catchment set is that urbanization may be the dominant change over the catchment during the record period the results obtained suggest that this hypothesis might be valid for a majority of catchments but a more detailed assessment of historical changes over the catchments in terms of land use and land cover as well as in terms of hydrographic and sewer networks should ideally be examined acknowledgments the funding for this study came from the

7419,the rapid urbanization and industrialization in developing countries have increased pollution by heavy metals which is a concern for human health and the environment in this study according to the data obtained from the monitoring stations in the songhua river basin the multivariate statistical analysis methods are applied to the hydrological data of the songhua river basin in order to examine the relation between human activities and the spatio temporal change of heavy metals pb and cu in water by comparing the concentrations at different flow periods the minimum pb concentrations are found to have occurred most frequently in low flow periods while the maximum values mostly appeared in average flow periods moreover the minimum cu concentration in the water frequently occurred in high flow periods the results show there are low pb and cu concentrations in upstream and downstream sections and high concentrations in mid stream sections and high concentrations are most frequently measured in the sections of ashihe downstream and estuary moreover we have predicted the future during 2018 2025 trend of the change for the heavy metals pollution in the rivers the results demonstrated intense human activities are the most important factor causing jump features of typical heavy metal pollution in the different periods for different sections of this study area the research would provide decision making and planning for the songhua river basin during the period of china s 13th five year plan keywords spatio temporal change typical heavy metals urbanization human activities songhua river basin 1 introduction under the influence of urbanization development and human productive activity more and more of pollutants are emitted into water which can cause many problems to the environment and human health eliasson 2015 larsen et al 2016 li et al 2017 heavy metal is a typical accumulative contaminants in the environment which is difficult to degrade once the environment is polluted by heavy metals it is difficult to restore rey et al 2013 mamat et al 2014 martín et al 2015 duodu et al 2016 singh and kumar 2017 cheng et al 2016 lu et al 2018 heavy metals pollution in river system is one of the major threats for aquatic life and human population due their toxicity bioaccumulation and persistence level in the environment heavy metals in water are seen to be present throughout the global water circulation system and they retain a certain dynamic balance with the water phase therein hostache et al 2014 islam et al 2015 ferreira et al 2016 kumar et al 2017 furthermore heavy metals in river sediments are gradually released into the water upon changes in prevailing environmental conditions which causes secondary pollution chabukdhara and nema 2012 wang et al 2015 heavy metals which are gradually enriched and magnified in biological chains to threaten human health have been one of the materials most likely to pollute and damage the aquatic environment haddeland et al 2014 yu and wang 2014 degger et al 2016 abraham and susan 2017 thus heavy metals from these anthropogenic sources pose serious threats to the environment and human health and have become a widespread concern due to their toxicity persistence abiotic degradation and bioaccumulation finkel and normile 2012 grygar et al 2013 fujita et al 2014 trenouth and gharabaghi 2015 shen et al 2016 lu et al 2017 heavy metals pollution and their potential effects on river water quality subjected to agriculture domestic and industrial pollution have been widely studied by following researchers singh et al 2014 evaluated hydrogeochemical parameters and heavy metals in groundwater and to study their spatial distribution in the rupnagar district of punjab it was observed that the concentration of parameters such as cd cr mn and pb is above permissible limit world health organization who in southern part of the study area kadhum et al 2015 evaluated the concentration of four metals cd ni cr and sn in the surface sediment samples from the langat river and used multivariate techniques to apportion the sources of the heavy metals the results showed that the highest concentration of metals in the langat river were found at jenjarom station dević et al 2016 analyzed the data for ten water quality variables collected during 2009 at 75 monitoring sites along the river network of serbia the results were alarming because 48 of the studied sites are contaminated by ni mn pb as and nutrients which were key factors impairing the water quality of the rivers in serbia marrugo negrete et al 2017 determined to evaluate the sources of heavy metals pollution and levels of pollution in 83 agricultural soils irrigated by the sinú river in northern colombia which were affected by mining areas upstream and inundated during seasonal floods events ice covering is a common phenomenon for rivers in northern china due to the impeding and separating effects exerted by the ice cover the mixing processes of pollutants the flow structure and the characteristics of water quality have been changed after the rivers being closed meanwhile the transport and the longitudinal distribution of pollutants over long distance have also been significantly changed as the most important branch of the sino russian boundary river the amur river the songhua river basin in china exerts a significant effect on the water quality in the amur river yu et al 2016 the songhua river basin is the only big river in china having almost five month november december january february march ice bound coverage of ice layers determines that water pollution in the songhua river basin exhibits certain characteristics sany et al 2013 pradhan and kumar 2014 yin et al 2015 yu and lu 2018 in recent years the songhua river basin has witnessed a new round of rapid economic development especially after the proposal of strategies for reviving the north eastern old industrial base in china and ensuring food security thus numerous heavy metals enter the waters of the songhua river basin through rainfall and overland runoff due to the occurrence of various problems including water and atmospheric pollution caused by rapid economic development and high intensity human activities moreover human activities along the river increase the disturbance thereof so heavy metals in sediments in parts of the river are re released and are likely to become secondary pollutants therefore this work is to explore the spatio temporal changes in typical heavy metals pb and cu in the main stream of songhua river and the dynamic changes in pb and cu concentrations in different periods by doing so the research will reveal the spatio temporal changes of the typical heavy metals in the songhua river basin and provide decision reverences for preventing water pollution and protecting the aquatic environment therein 2 data and methods 2 1 research region the segment of songhua river basin alongside harbin city 124 2 e to 128 3 e 45 9 n to 46 57 n is taken as the research region fig 1 running for 66 km in total the main section flows through zhushuntun ashihe estuary hulanhe estuary and dadingzishan where the altitudes vary between 75 m and 700 m controlled by the temperate continental monsoon climate the region has distinct seasonal differences in the distributions of rainfall and runoff within the basin and the runoff volumes in high flow periods account for 60 to 80 of annual runoff volumes the runoff volumes in high flow periods are mainly accumulated in july and august which generally account for 50 60 of total annual runoff moreover annual average rainfall gradually increases from 400 mm in the west to 750 mm in the east according to the annual rainfall in harbin and the monthly runoff accumulations in the harbin segment as recorded by hydrological stations three periods are used to sub divide the year including the high average and low flow periods of them the high flow period consists of june july august and september while march april may october and december comprise the average flow period the low flow period consists of january february and november fig 2 the runoff volumes in the three periods in the harbin segment of songhua river basin show significant differences namely the periods alternate between low and high flow periods the runoff volumes in high flow periods are over 2300 m3 s while those in low flow periods are around 300 m3 s the intra annual change in runoff volumes in songhua river basin are mainly influenced by multiple factors including rainfall land cover and wetland control etc the reasons for heavy metals pollution pb and cu of the harbin segment of songhua river basin are as follows 1 the pollution caused by contaminated upland water 2 non point source pollution formed by overland runoff and 3 the pollution caused by domestic sewage and industrial wastewater in harbin city the pollution of upland water is mainly caused by wastewater discharged from cities and towns along the nen river the second songhua river yinma river etc the sewage from changchun jilin and qiqihar cities is discharged into songhua river through yinma river second songhua river and nen river respectively moreover non point source pollution of farmlands as well as water and soil loss caused by the deterioration of local vegetation also exerts a significant impact on water quality in the songhua river therefore the heavy metals pb and cu pollution severely affect the peoples health and safety healthy development of economy and eco environmental security towards the downstream of the songhua river basin this study is to characterise the spatial temporal change of heavy metals and their degree of contamination in the harbin segment of the songhua river basin the research results will also provide the decision support for controlling the discharge of water pollutions in the songhua river basin 2 2 data sources the research data mainly comes from report on the state of the environment in harbin 2000 2015 and the monitoring stations zhushuntun ashihe hulanhe and dadingzishan the concentrations of heavy metals pb and cu in water from the harbin segment of the songhua river from 2000 to 2015 are divided into those occurring in three periods including the 10th five year plan 2001 2005 the 11th five year plan 2006 2010 and the 12th five year plan 2011 2015 2 3 analysis methods non parametric tests and parametric tests are two types of test data and consequently different types of analysis a parametric test is a test in which investigators assume as working hypothesis an underlying distribution for research data while a non parametric test is a test done without assuming any particular distribution a common requirement of both parametric and non parametric trend tests is that the data be independent basic assumptions in classical parametric tests such as normality linearity and independency are not generally provided in typical surface water quality therefore it is more appropriate to use non parametric tests rather than parametric tests ceribasi et al 2014 the linear trend is the most straightforward assessment of the long term behavior of a time series gorji sefidmazgi et al 2014 the accumulative anomaly aa method is a direct nonlinear test approach to examine the abrupt changes of hydroclimatic time series tian et al 2016 the changes in pb and cu concentrations in different sections and water periods are statistically analyzed by using the linear trend analysis lta method and an accumulative anomaly aa method the specific formulae are as follows 1 mean value x x 1 x 2 x n n 1 n i 1 n x i 2 coefficient of variation c v σ x i 1 n k i 1 2 n 3 standard deviation σ i 1 n x i x 2 n 4 coefficient of skewness c s i 1 n k i 1 3 nc v 3 where k i indicates the modulus coefficient and k i x i x 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal changes the section in zhushuntun exhibits a significant pb concentration fluctuation while pb concentrations in other sections don t change significantly during high flow periods fig 3 a in average flow periods the pb concentration in ashihe decreases those in the hulanhe estuary and dadingzishan sections change significantly while those in other sections don t change significantly fig 3 b in low flow periods the pb concentrations in zhushuntun ashihe estuary and hulanhe estuary change significantly while those in other sections only change slightly fig 3 c among the six monitored sections of the songhua river basin alongside harbin city the minimum pb concentration 0 0002 mg l is found in high flow periods while the maximum 0 045 mg l appears in low flow periods in low flow periods ashihe and downstream exhibit the highest pb concentration 0 018 mg l meeting the third grade water quality standard among the six monitored sections which is followed by hulanhe and downstream in contrast the pb concentrations in other sections all meet the first grade water quality standard 0 01 mg l in high flow periods the maximum pb concentration 0 006 mg l occurs in zhushuntun which is beyond the third grade water quality standard 0 05 mg l moreover the pb concentration in the ashihe estuary ranks second and water qualities in other sections only reach the third grade water quality standard 0 05 mg l in high flow periods fig 3 d the cu concentrations of sections in zhushuntun and ashihe decrease while those in other sections don t change significantly only gradually increasing in places in average flow periods fig 3 e ashihe estuary and the downstream of ashihe exhibit significant changes in the cu concentrations while other sections show a relatively steady change in the cu concentrations in low flow periods fig 3 f the cu concentration in the harbin segment changes significantly especially in the ashihe estuary in contrast the minimum cu concentration 0 0003 mg l occurs in high flow periods while the maximum 0 06 mg l appears in average flow periods in low flow periods the ashihe estuary shows the highest cu concentration 0 054 mg l compared with other sections moreover the cu concentrations in the sections of zhushuntun ashihe estuary and from ashihe downstream exceed the standard required for first grade water quality 0 01 mg l in average and low flow periods while in high flow periods the ashihe estuary exhibits a relatively high cu concentration with a maximum value of 0 02 mg l additionally the cu concentrations in some sections of zhushuntun and ashihe reaches exceed the first grade water quality standard 0 01 mg l while those in other sections all conform to the first grade water quality standard 3 2 inter annual changes from the perspective of inter annual change the peak pb concentrations in the zhushuntun section in low and high flow periods are separately found in 2003 and 2005 fig 3 a c the years when the pb concentration exceeds the third grade water quality standard 0 05 mg l in the two periods separately account for 37 5 and 12 5 of the total period 2000 2015 in average flow periods the pb concentration in the dadingzishan section exhibits a significant inter annual change and is higher than the third grade water quality standard 0 05 mg l from 2001 to 2015 in low flow periods the pb concentrations in the sections of the ashihe and hulanhe estuaries fluctuate and the peaks both occur in 2005 while the years when the pb concentration exceeds the third grade water quality standard account for 81 25 and 31 45 of the total research period respectively the cu concentration in ashihe changes significantly in high average and low flow periods fig 3 d f moreover in high flow periods the years when the cu concentration is higher than the first grade water quality standard account for 56 25 of the total period while in average and low flow periods the cu concentration is not found to satisfy the first grade water quality standard from 2001 to 2015 in addition the years when the cu concentration in the zhushuntun section in high and low flow periods exceed the first grade water quality standard account for 12 5 and 18 75 of the total period respectively the years when the cu concentrations in the section of ashihe in high average and low flow periods are higher than the first grade water quality standard account for 56 25 93 75 and 100 of the total period respectively 3 3 spatial changes in terms of spatial changes the changes in annual runoff volumes of the six monitored sections in the harbin segment of the songhua river basin are consistent with those of the pb and cu concentrations this shows that changes in the runoff volumes in the songhua river basin have a direct influence on the pb and cu concentrations in the harbin segment some midstream sections ashihe and hulanhe estuaries in the songhua river basin have higher pb and cu concentrations this is because there are numerous sewage outfalls in the midstream area the minimum pb and cu concentrations are found in the zhushuntun and dadingzishan sections in the upper and lower reaches of the system this is because there are no sewage outfalls in upstream areas and the downstream areas have relatively low concentrations due to self purification of the river water the minimum pb and cu concentrations are found in the zhushuntun section as it lies in the upstream reach of the harbin segment of the songhua river basin and there is no sewage outfall therein the maximum of pb concentration is generally detected in the section downstream from ashihe in contrast the maximum cu concentration is mostly found in the section downstream from ashihe because the pollution cu is discharge through sewage outfalls of the ashihe river upstream 3 4 statistical analysis by analysing cumulative changes in pb and cu concentrations tables 1 and 2 it can be seen that the average pb concentrations in high average and low water periods account for 11 05 60 27 and 28 68 of the pb concentration all year round respectively while the average cu concentrations in these periods are 18 01 43 91 and 38 07 of the cu concentrations all year round respectively it indicates that the highest pb and cu concentrations in the harbin segment are mainly found in the average flow period and the average pb and cu concentrations are 0 0104 mg l and 0 0150 mg l respectively additionally it is considered that the pb and total cu concentrations fluctuate most significantly in average and high flow periods tables 1 and 2 the range of the coefficient of variation of pb and cu concentrations reach 0 3540 and 0 1935 respectively moreover the pb and cu concentrations show the lowest fluctuation in average and low flow periods it can be seen from tables 1 and 2 that the coefficients of skewness for the pb and cu concentrations during the 12th five year plan are significantly lower than those during the 10th and 11th five year plans in different water periods the smaller the coefficient of skewness the less significant the fluctuations in the pb and cu concentrations the extent of pollution by pb gradually declines as indicates by the trends in the pb and cu concentrations during the 10th 11th and 12th five year plans however cu pollution increases gradually from the 10th to 11th five year plan periods while it decreases during the 12th five year plan this indicates that the pollution caused by upstream runoff in harbin city has been abated due to the implementation of preventative engineering measures in 12th five year plan periods taken to counter water pollution and protective measures taken to the benefit of the aquatic environment in the songhua river basin during the 12th five year plan the pb and cu concentrations in the harbin segment of the songhua river basin decrease and the quality of the aquatic environment is obviously improved based on the annual mean concentration of typical heavy metals pb and cu data at the six gauging stations in the mainstream of the river and the annual runoff data in the river basin during 2000 2015 the quantitative relationship is proposed through the linear fitting methods the results shows that the pb and cu concentrations are largely influenced by the runoff fig 4 in the different periods especially in the high flow period moreover the pb and cu concentrations also may be affect by physics chemistry human activities etc in average and low flow periods considering these uncertainties the linear trend analysis and an accumulative anomaly methods are applied to predict the change trend of the pb and cu concentrations at the six sections above zhushuntun ashihe estuary ashihe down hulanhe estuary hulanhe down dadingzishan during 2018 2025 fig 4 the prediction results demonstrate that with the implementation of the china action plan for water pollution control and the most strict water resources management system during the 13th five year plan period the total discharge quantity of water pollutants in the songhua river basin is effectively controlled the discharge amounts of typical heavy metals pb and cu presents an overall decreasing trend and the typical heavy metals pb and cu decreases significantly year by year meanwhile the water environmental quality is significantly improved the results are consistent with the objective of water pollution control of the songhua river basin during the 13th five year plan period 4 conclusions the present study is an attempt to detect the change trends of heavy metals and their degree of contamination in the harbin segment of the songhua river basin the spatio temporal changes of the pb and cu concentrations in six monitored sections are investigated by using the linear trend analysis method and an accumulative anomaly method by multivariable analysis it is apparent that there are low the pb and cu concentrations in upstream and downstream sections and large concentrations in mid stream sections and high concentrations are most frequently measured in the sections of ashihe downstream and estuary on the time scale there are the higher pb and cu concentrations in the early stages while lower concentrations are found thereafter moreover with implementation of the china action plan for water pollution control and the most strict water resources management system during the 13th five year plan period the prediction results also show that the discharge amounts of typical heavy metals pb and cu present an overall decreasing trend and the typical heavy metals pb and cu concentrations decrease significantly year by year which is consistent with the objective of water pollution control during the 13th five year plan this study shows that heavy metals contamination in water mainly originate from intensive human activities fertilizers agricultural ashes industrial effluents and domestic sewage in the songhua river basin the results reveals the spatial temporal change of heavy metals and their degree of contamination research on change laws and characteristics of typical heavy metals pb and cu in the songhua river basin has practical significance in controlling the generation and emission of the heavy metals pollutant here despite its limitations this research gives the description of the overall pollution levels and health risks posed by heavy metals in water of the songhua river basin moreover heavy metals in water continues to pose high carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risks to the public especially to children and those living in the most severely polluted regions this work provides quantitative evidence demonstrating the critical need for strengthened water resources management and pollution control of the songhua river basin in order to protect residents from heavy metal discharges into the songhua river basin the results provide decision references of the planning and management for the songhua river basin during the period of china s 13th five year plan acknowledgements this research is supported by the program for china postdoctoral science foundation china no 2016m591139 the

river basin alongside harbin city 124 2 e to 128 3 e 45 9 n to 46 57 n is taken as the research region fig 1 running for 66 km in total the main section flows through zhushuntun ashihe estuary hulanhe

rainfall and runoff within the basin and the runoff volumes in high flow periods account for 60 to 80 of annual runoff volumes the runoff volumes in high flow periods are mainly accumulated in july

november fig 2 the runoff volumes in the three periods in the harbin segment of songhua river basin show significant differences namely the periods alternate between low and high flow periods the runoff volumes in high flow periods are over 2300 m3 s while those in low flow periods are around 300 m3 s the intra annual change in runoff volumes in songhua river basin are mainly influenced by multiple factors including rainfall land cover and wetland control etc the reasons for heavy metals pollution pb and cu of the harbin segment of songhua river basin are as follows 1 the pollution caused by contaminated upland water 2 non point source pollution formed by overland runoff and 3 the pollution caused by domestic sewage and industrial wastewater in harbin city the pollution of upland water is mainly caused by wastewater discharged from cities and towns along the nen river the second songhua river yinma river etc the sewage from changchun jilin and qiqihar cities is discharged into songhua river through yinma river second songhua river and nen river respectively moreover non point source pollution of farmlands as well as water and soil loss caused by the deterioration of local vegetation also exerts a significant impact on water quality in the songhua river therefore the heavy metals pb and cu pollution severely affect the peoples health and safety healthy development of economy and eco environmental security towards the downstream of the songhua river basin this study is to characterise the spatial temporal change of heavy metals and their degree of contamination in the harbin segment of the songhua river basin the research results will also provide the decision support for controlling the discharge of water pollutions in the songhua river basin 2 2 data sources the research data mainly comes from report on the state of the environment in harbin 2000 2015 and the monitoring stations zhushuntun ashihe hulanhe and dadingzishan the concentrations of heavy metals pb and cu in water from the harbin segment of the songhua river from 2000 to 2015 are divided into those occurring in three periods including the 10th five year plan 2001 2005 the 11th five year plan 2006 2010 and the 12th five year plan 2011 2015 2 3 analysis methods non parametric tests and parametric tests are two types of test data and consequently different types of analysis a parametric test is a test in which investigators assume as working hypothesis an underlying distribution for research data while a non parametric test is a test done without assuming any particular distribution a common requirement of both parametric and non parametric trend tests is that the data be independent basic assumptions in classical parametric tests such as normality linearity and independency are not generally provided in typical surface water quality therefore it is more appropriate to use non parametric tests rather than parametric tests ceribasi et al 2014 the linear trend is the most straightforward assessment of the long term behavior of a time series gorji sefidmazgi et al 2014 the accumulative anomaly aa method is a direct nonlinear test approach to examine the abrupt changes of hydroclimatic time series tian et al 2016 the changes in pb and cu concentrations in different sections and water periods are statistically analyzed by using the linear trend analysis lta method and an accumulative anomaly aa method the specific formulae are as follows 1 mean value x x 1 x 2 x n n 1 n i 1 n x i 2 coefficient of variation c v σ x i 1 n k i 1 2 n 3 standard deviation σ i 1 n x i x 2 n 4 coefficient of skewness c s i 1 n k i 1 3 nc v 3 where k i indicates the modulus coefficient and k i x i x 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal changes the section in zhushuntun exhibits a significant pb concentration fluctuation while pb concentrations in other sections don t change significantly during high flow periods fig 3 a in average flow periods the pb concentration in ashihe decreases those in the hulanhe estuary and dadingzishan sections change significantly while those in other sections don t change significantly fig 3 b in low flow periods the pb concentrations in zhushuntun ashihe estuary and hulanhe estuary change significantly while those in other sections only change slightly fig 3 c among the six monitored sections of the songhua river basin alongside harbin city the minimum pb concentration 0 0002 mg l is found in high flow periods while the maximum 0 045 mg l appears in low flow periods in low flow periods ashihe and downstream exhibit the highest pb concentration 0 018 mg l meeting the third grade water quality standard among the six monitored sections which is followed by hulanhe and downstream in contrast the pb concentrations in other sections all meet the first grade water quality standard 0 01 mg l in high flow periods the maximum pb concentration 0 006 mg l occurs in zhushuntun which is beyond the third grade water quality standard 0 05 mg l moreover the pb concentration in the ashihe estuary ranks second and water qualities in other sections only reach the third grade water quality standard 0 05 mg l in high flow periods fig 3 d the cu concentrations of sections in zhushuntun and ashihe decrease while those in other sections don t change significantly only gradually increasing in places in average flow periods fig 3 e ashihe estuary and the downstream of ashihe exhibit significant changes in the cu concentrations while other sections show a relatively steady change in the cu concentrations in low flow periods fig 3 f the cu concentration in the harbin segment changes significantly especially in the ashihe estuary in contrast the minimum cu concentration 0 0003 mg l occurs in high flow periods while the maximum 0 06 mg l appears in average flow periods in low flow periods the ashihe estuary shows the highest cu concentration 0 054 mg l compared with other sections moreover the cu concentrations in the sections of zhushuntun ashihe estuary and from ashihe downstream exceed the standard required for first grade water quality 0 01 mg l in average and low flow periods while in high flow periods the ashihe estuary exhibits a relatively high cu concentration with a maximum value of 0 02 mg l additionally the cu concentrations in some sections of zhushuntun and ashihe reaches exceed the first grade water quality standard 0 01 mg l while those in other sections all conform to the first grade water quality standard 3 2 inter annual changes from the perspective of inter annual change the peak pb concentrations in the zhushuntun section in low and high flow periods are separately found in 2003 and 2005 fig 3 a c the years when the pb concentration exceeds the third grade water quality standard 0 05 mg l in the two periods separately account for 37 5 and 12 5 of the total period 2000 2015 in average flow periods the pb concentration in the dadingzishan section exhibits a significant inter annual change and is higher than the third grade water quality standard 0 05 mg l from 2001 to 2015 in low flow periods the pb concentrations in the sections of the ashihe and hulanhe estuaries fluctuate and the peaks both occur in 2005 while the years when the pb concentration exceeds the third grade water quality standard account for 81 25 and 31 45 of the total research period respectively the cu concentration in ashihe changes significantly in high average and low flow periods fig 3 d f moreover in high flow periods the years when the cu concentration is higher than the first grade water quality standard account for 56 25 of the total period while in average and low flow periods the cu concentration is not found to satisfy the first grade water quality standard from 2001 to 2015 in addition the years when the cu concentration in the zhushuntun section in high and low flow periods exceed the first grade water quality standard account for 12 5 and 18 75 of the total period respectively the years when the cu concentrations in the section of ashihe in high average and low flow periods are higher than the first grade water quality standard account for 56 25 93 75 and 100 of the total period respectively 3 3 spatial changes in terms of spatial changes the changes in annual runoff volumes of the six monitored sections in the harbin segment of the songhua river basin are consistent with those of the pb and cu concentrations this shows that changes in the runoff volumes in the songhua river basin have a direct influence on the pb and cu concentrations in the harbin segment some midstream sections ashihe and hulanhe estuaries in the songhua river basin have higher pb and cu concentrations this is because there are numerous sewage outfalls in the midstream area the minimum pb and cu concentrations are found in the zhushuntun and dadingzishan sections in the upper and lower reaches of the system this is because there are no sewage outfalls in upstream areas and the downstream areas have relatively low concentrations due to self purification of the river water the minimum pb and cu concentrations are found in the zhushuntun section as it lies in the upstream reach of the harbin segment of the songhua river basin and there is no sewage outfall therein the maximum of pb concentration is generally detected in the section downstream from ashihe in contrast the maximum cu concentration is mostly found in the section downstream from ashihe because the pollution cu is discharge through sewage outfalls of the ashihe river upstream 3 4 statistical analysis by analysing cumulative changes in pb and cu concentrations tables 1 and 2 it can be seen that the average pb concentrations in high average and low water periods account for 11 05 60 27 and 28 68 of the pb concentration all year round respectively while the average cu concentrations in these periods are 18 01 43 91 and 38 07 of the cu concentrations all year round respectively it indicates that the highest pb and cu concentrations in the harbin segment are mainly found in the average flow period and the average pb and cu concentrations are 0 0104 mg l and 0 0150 mg l respectively additionally it is considered that the pb and total cu concentrations fluctuate most significantly in average and high flow periods tables 1 and 2 the range of the coefficient of variation of pb and cu concentrations reach 0 3540 and 0 1935 respectively moreover the pb and cu concentrations show the lowest fluctuation in average and low flow periods it can be seen from tables 1 and 2 that the coefficients of skewness for the pb and cu concentrations during the 12th five year plan are significantly lower than those during the 10th and 11th five year plans in different water periods the smaller the coefficient of skewness the less significant the fluctuations in the pb and cu concentrations the extent of pollution by pb gradually declines as indicates by the trends in the pb and cu concentrations during the 10th 11th and 12th five year plans however cu pollution increases gradually from the 10th to 11th five year plan periods while it decreases during the 12th five year plan this indicates that the pollution caused by upstream runoff in harbin city has been abated due to the implementation of preventative engineering measures in 12th five year plan periods taken to counter water pollution and protective measures taken to the benefit of the aquatic environment in the songhua river basin during the 12th five year plan the pb and cu concentrations in the harbin segment of the songhua river basin decrease and the quality of the aquatic environment is obviously improved based on the annual mean concentration of typical heavy metals pb and cu data at the six gauging stations in the mainstream of the river and the annual runoff data in the river basin during 2000 2015 the quantitative relationship is proposed through the linear fitting methods the results shows that the pb and cu concentrations are largely influenced by the runoff fig 4 in the different periods especially in the high flow period moreover the pb and cu concentrations also may be affect by physics chemistry human activities etc in average and low flow periods considering these uncertainties the linear trend analysis and an accumulative anomaly methods are applied to predict the change trend of the pb and cu concentrations at the six sections above zhushuntun ashihe estuary ashihe down hulanhe estuary hulanhe down dadingzishan during 2018 2025 fig 4 the prediction results demonstrate that with the implementation of the china action plan for water pollution control and the most strict water resources management system during the 13th five year plan period the total discharge quantity of water pollutants in the songhua river basin is effectively controlled the discharge amounts of typical heavy metals pb and cu presents an overall decreasing trend and the typical heavy metals pb and cu decreases significantly year by year meanwhile the water environmental quality is significantly improved the results are consistent with the objective of water pollution control of the songhua river basin during the 13th five year plan period 4 conclusions the present study is an attempt to detect the change trends of heavy metals and their degree of contamination in the harbin segment of the songhua river basin the spatio temporal changes of the pb and cu concentrations in six monitored sections are investigated by using the linear trend analysis method and an accumulative anomaly method by multivariable analysis it is apparent that there are low the pb and cu concentrations in upstream and downstream sections and large concentrations in mid stream sections and high concentrations are most frequently measured in the sections of ashihe downstream and estuary on the time scale there are the higher pb and cu concentrations in the early stages while lower concentrations are found thereafter moreover with implementation of the china action plan for water pollution control and the most strict water resources management system during the 13th five year plan period the prediction results also show that the discharge amounts of typical heavy metals pb and cu present an overall decreasing trend and the typical heavy metals pb and cu concentrations decrease significantly year by year which is consistent with the objective of water pollution control during the 13th five year plan this study shows that heavy metals contamination in water mainly originate from intensive human activities fertilizers agricultural ashes industrial effluents and domestic sewage in the songhua river basin the results reveals the spatial temporal change of heavy metals and their degree of contamination research on change laws and characteristics of typical heavy metals pb and cu in the songhua river basin has practical significance in controlling the generation and emission of the heavy metals pollutant here despite its limitations this research gives the description of the overall pollution levels and health risks posed by heavy metals in water of the songhua river basin moreover heavy metals in water continues to pose high carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risks to the public especially to children and those living in the most severely polluted regions this work provides quantitative evidence demonstrating the critical need for strengthened water resources management and pollution control of the songhua river basin in order to protect residents from heavy metal discharges into the songhua river basin the results provide decision references of the planning and management for the songhua river basin during the period of china s 13th five year plan acknowledgements this research is supported by the program for china postdoctoral science foundation china no 2016m591139 the
