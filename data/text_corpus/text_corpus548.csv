2740,hydraulic conditions and water resources management projects can significantly alter river floodplain connectivity which in turn can alter hydrologic and biogeochemical processes in river corridors in this study the hydrodynamics of river floodplain connectivity under different flood conditions and the effect of the nanchang water resources project group nwrpg in the middle branch of the ganjang river were investigated using a combination of two dimensional hydrodynamic simulations and particle tracking the hydrodynamic model was calibrated and validated using data from several gauging stations and field measurements floods in the ganjang river can be limited to the river itself river flood flood with normal lake level or further extended to the poyang lake lake flood flood with high lake level the results show that compared with river flood scenarios lake flood scenarios increased the water level flooding a larger area the flow velocity decreased and the residence time rt of particles increased the particle travel distance ptd of river flood was larger than that of lake flood the larger the flood the greater the transboundary flux between the river and the floodplain and the shorter the rt and ptd the effect of nwrpg was the permanent flooding of part of the river floodplain causing some habitat loss due to the increase in discharge the implementation of the nwrpg results in a shorter rt with a smaller standard deviation which has little effect on the ptd distribution these findings can facilitate river connectivity restoration efforts in the ganjang river and also provide a reference for assessing the impact of barrage projects keywords river floodplain connectivity hydrodynamic modeling particle tracking natural floods engineered hydraulic conditions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the compound cross section rivers comprised of a river s main channel and its floodplains are the most common type of lowland river system rowiński and radecki pawlik 2015 river floodplain connectivity is a typical part of hydrologic connectivity gooseff et al 2017 during the dry season water flow is limited to the main channel while during flooding seasons floodplains are filled by water performing important environmental mahl et al 2015 and biological functions covino 2017 kang and choi 2005 the interaction between the river channel and its floodplains has long been recognized as a key process in maintaining riverine ecosystems because it facilitates the exchange of large amounts of water sediment or organic matter and nutrients between rivers floodplains and riparian wetlands harvey and gooseff 2015 shuai et al 2017 quantitative analysis of hydrologic connectivity between rivers and their floodplains in response to different hydrological conditions and to the implementation of water resources management projects is important to identify how the river floodplain connectivity could affect water quality and ecological processes in river systems fu et al 2020 tan et al 2021 the lateral exchange of water sediment nutrients and contaminants between a river and its floodplain is dependent on hydrodynamics and river morphology water resources management projects could drastically modify the hydrological conditions and impact the rivers hydrodynamics sediment transport and morphology in a compound channel momentum exchange occurs at the interface between the rivers and the floodplains dupuis et al 2017 proust et al 2017 due to the velocity difference between the main channel and the floodplains at the interface between the floodplain and the main channel kelvin helmholtz kh instability causes a complex turbulent structure related to a series of vertically orientated vortices and streamwise orientated vortices located both in the floodplain and the main channel proust and nikora 2020 spiral vortices lai et al 2008 and coherent structures of various time and length scales xiao and wang 2007 are observed past studies on compound channels ding et al 2022 knight and demetriou 1983 shiono and knight 1991 focused on the impact of changes in the depth ratio and floodplain characteristics on hydrodynamic properties such as flow velocity distribution turbulent flow structure and boundary shear stress because investigating river floodplain connections during flooding conditions is extremely dangerous for instrumentation and researchers river floodplain interaction field studies are uncommon models based upon the shallow water equations are widely used on large scale free surface flow problems tan et al 2021 particle tracking methods have proven to be effective in delineating flow fields wang et al 2018 determining flow paths li et al 2008 and travel times jing et al 2021 these methods have also been used to study pollutant dispersion salamon et al 2006 sediment transport zhao et al 2011 oil spills goeury 2012 algal movement joly 2011 and connectivity patterns in the northern gulf of california marinone et al 2008 chen et al 2020 first proposed the use of a particle tracking simulation method to quantify flow dynamics between a river channel and its floodplains particle tracking methods are also able to figure out the water travel length and residence time inside the floodplains lowland rivers are often located in areas with a large population in which the conservation of good water quality levels is challenging this leads to the creation of projects to manage water resources which may change the way rivers and floodplains connect using hydrodynamic modeling and particle tracking analysis the present study investigates the hydrological connectivity of river floodplain systems under changing natural and engineered hydraulic conditions the ganjiang river is the largest tributary of the poyang lake basin and the fourth largest tributary of the yangtze river it flows from south to north through the entire territory of jiangxi province china the management of the ganjiang river is crucial to the hydrology and ecology of the poyang lake basin and even of the yangtze river basin to raise the water level during the low flow season the nanchang water resources project group nwrpg is being planned the main scientific objectives addressed in this study are to analyze the characteristics of river floodplain interactions under different flood characteristics evaluate the impact of the implementation of the nwrpg on river floodplain connectivity 2 method 2 1 study site the lower middle branch of ganjiang river the study was conducted at the lower middle branch of the ganjiang river in jiangxi china the ganjiang river flows north through the western part of jiangxi province before entering poyang lake and later the yangtze river fig 1 a this river provides water resources to the city of nanchang as well as acts as an ecological corridor for fish and other aquatic species floods in the ganjiang river can be generally divided into two types river flood and lake flood they have a different frequency the river flood refers to the flood in the ganjiang river but not in the poyang lake the lake flood means both the ganjiang river and the poyang lake are under flood conditions however due to uncontrolled river sand mining the low flow water level in the lower ganjiang river is lower than before water utilization conditions have deteriorated and the water resources for urban water supply and agricultural irrigation in the region are scarce in recent years several water resources management projects such as for flood control waterway management and environmental management have been implemented or planned in the ganjiang river basin liu 2018 the nanchang water resources project group nwrpg is being planned with four individual projects to raise the water level in the downstream ganjiang river during the low flow season the xiangshan project the lianxin project the nanxin project and the jili project see fig 1a for the positions of the corresponding projects the main hydraulic structures used in the nwrpg include gates ship locks and fish tunnels etc from april to july i e the flood season the gates will be fully open from august to march of the following year the river level will be controlled after the completion of these projects it is anticipated that the water level will rise and the discharge will increase during the dry season while the water level will remain stable during the flood season 2 2 governing equations for fluid flow and particle transport the two dimensional shallow water equations swes are implemented for hydrodynamic modeling because of their ability to accurately simulate surface hydraulics in river floodplain systems they have achieved widespread application in a variety of complex free surface flows cao et al 2020 he et al 2018 lim et al 2019 tang et al 2020 1 h t u h h d i v u s h 2 u t u u g z x s x 1 h d i v h ν ν

ganjiang river is limited inside the main channel having a curved planform in a curved channel the flow speeds up in the direction of the curve and centrifugal forces act in proportion to the average speed blankaert et al 2006 the development and decay processes of secondary flows in curved channels can be accounted for with the transport equation for streamwise vorticity bernard and schneider

lagrangian particle tracking study to examine how flow parcels move through the study region here we consider observations of passive particles transported by the river flow the state of the flow is described in eulerian coordinates by the shallow water equations the link between the lagrangian data and the classical eulerian variables of the shallow water model is made by the following two dimensional transport model 12 d x dt u x t t where x is the coordinate vector of a particle as a function of time u is the velocity vector at time t integrating 12 yields 13 x t δ t x t t t δ t u x t

code that uses the fourth order of the runge kutta method to track particles was prepared in house in a depth averaged shallow water flow field each 2 d particle emitted at a given horizontal plane point is associated with the scalar property flow depth which corresponds to a vertical line or water column in the flow domain therefore statistics for a large number of two dimensional particles weighted by their flow depths are thus capable of representing the actual dynamics of the water body in the two dimensional plane integrating along the depth shows the properties of a two dimensional particle that represents a body of water chen et al 2020 19 f i 0 h f i d z where i is the particle number f is the property for a water column that can be calculated by integrating f along the depth of the column e g f is the mass flux and f is the velocity magnitude using the particle method such a property can be expressed by 20 f i k 1 n i f i j h i j h i f i where f i j is the property f of the j th unit volume in the domain f i is the average value of the property f for the water column h i j is the height of the j th unit volume this weighted analysis approach applies to the statistical properties of 2 d particles 2 4 boundary settings and equations solving the boundary conditions for the numerical domain are set as steady flow which are presented in fig 2 b on the upstream boundary a specified discharge is prescribed while the corresponding water level is assigned on the downstream boundary the right or left boundary conditions relative to the flow direction of the model domain are considered no flow boundary conditions the system of partial differential equations represented in eq 1 11 was solved with telemac 2d a shallow water equations finite element model fem solver of the integrated free surface flow suite telemac mascaret which was developed initially by the national hydraulics and environment laboratory lnhe of the research and development directorate of the french electricity board edf r d france a conjugate gradient method was used to solve the hydrodynamic propagation step and the standard k ε model system hervouet 2007 the surface water modeling system sms was used for triangle mesh generation after format conversion with blue kenue telemac2d can use the meshes generated by sms a higher density of elements was constructed in the vicinity of the main channel to obtain a more accurate solution fig 2b the model domain is 21 000 m in length and 420 1250 m in width a grid refinement was first conducted to ensure mesh independence of the results blocken and gualtieri 2012 three meshes with element nodes of 4846 6460 and 24 959 were generated respectively table 1 compares the surface level and velocity of p1 fig 2b results with a mesh of 7000 nodes and above were mesh independent finally a mesh with 48 818 cells and 24 959 nodes was used to provide a more realistic flow structure and smooth particle trajectories in the channel the minimum element size was 25 m and as this length gradually increased from channel to floodplain the maximum size was 45 m the simulation was carried out over one year for a wider range of the river reach and included the upper part of the study area and other branches of the ganjiang river to use the data from more gauging stations for validation fig 2a as shown in fig 1d the left upstream floodplain is larger than the right downstream floodplain and the downstream floodplain on the right was found to be permanently flooded after the implementation of the nwrpg in the subsequent study therefore we conducted the particle tracking analysis in the area upstream of the left upstream floodplain different hydrological conditions and different effects from the river flood the lake flood and from the nwrpg were considered as scenarios table 1 according to the historical hydrological series the average january runoff representing the dry season flow is 151 97 m3 s the annual average runoff is 491 168 m3 s and the 5 yr flood 10 yr flood and 20 yr flood discharges are 4 338 68 4 898 08 and 5 338 53 m3 s respectively the river flood effects are considered for a 10 yr flood and 20 yr flood the discharge is the same as in the lake flood while the water level is lower due to the implementation of nwrpg the corresponding flows change at different frequencies from the perspective of water resource availability the dry season and average annual flows are lower than before but water levels are higher during the flood season the water level is controlled at the same level as the lake flood but the discharge increases the model scenarios are introduced for the setup of model scenarios table 2 and 12 runs were carried out for each flood event we released a total of 3 000 particles from the upstream section of the left upstream floodplain 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation the 2013 hydrological data was used for model calibration the model was calibrated by changing bed roughness manning coefficient n after validation the manning coefficient was set to 0 024 which is similar to the one used in the poyang lake model xiao et al 2022 the trends of the numerical model and the measured water level in four gauging stations are basically consistent the nash coefficients are above 0 99 and the maximum water level error does not exceed 0 1 m fig 3 the results show reasonable agreement between the model results and measured data for model validation three hydrological tests were conducted in july 2019 waizhou discharge 3 780 m3 s september 2020 waizhou discharge 2 800 m3 s and october 2020 waizhou discharge 470 m3 s at thirteen survey sections fig 1b and c there are 12 or 13 measurement points available for each survey section the cross sectional average water levels and the vertically averaged streamwise velocity were measured the hydrodynamic processes in july 2019 and september october 2020 were calculated by the large model and the results were compared with the measured cross sectional average water levels and vertically averaged streamwise velocity fig 4 both the calculated water level and velocity show reasonable agreement with the measured data the difference between the calculated and measured values of individual measurement points is mostly due to the time and topography of the tests 3 2 flood inundation and flow velocity distribution the map of the water depth and the flooded area where gray indicates areas not flooded and color indicates the water depth of the inundation area is presented in fig 5 in january scenarios the flow passes in the main channel below the left upstream floodplain and in the upper and lower main channels of the right downstream floodplain fig 5b1 the left upstream floodplain has some obvious isolated patches in january scenarios these small wetland areas can play a vital role in preserving the ecological quality of rivers at the average annual flow the flow overflows the two main channels above and below the left floodplain and the right downstream floodplain is mostly inundated fig 5b2 the whole model domain is covered by water flow under the flood action of lake flood fig 5 b3 5 under the action of river flood the left upstream floodplain still has partial outcropping fig 5 a1 2 which could be a refuge for organisms after the implementation of the nwrpg water depth is increased for all conditions fig 5 c the main channel above the left upstream floodplain and the right downstream are always flooded the river loses some of the upland areas that can be exposed during january the velocity field is displayed in fig 6 the implementation of the nwrpg reduces the velocity in january and the average annual flow fig 6 c1 2 during floods the main channel above the left upstream floodplain becomes the main overflow channel as the flood water tends to straighten out figs 6 a1 2 b3 5 c3 5 due to the much lower water level the velocity under river flood conditions is generally greater than under lake flood conditions fig 6 a1 2 from the perspective of the january and average annual flow the implementation of nwrpg results in increased water depth fig 5 c1 2 and lower velocity fig 6 c1 2 due to the increased discharge in the middle branch under the nwrpg the velocity becomes larger in the flood season fig 6 c3 4 3 3 effect of the hydraulic conditions on lateral flow exchange the transboundary flux is calculated by integrating unit discharge u h along riverbank lines 21 q int u h n d l where u is the velocity vector h is the water depth and n is the normal vector of bank line l pointing to the floodplain side since the right downstream floodplain is permanently inundated only the transboundary fluxes of the left upstream floodplain were analyzed in the present study the transboundary flux of river floodplain is presented in fig 7 the bank line of the left upstream floodplain is marked on fig 1d the ratios of the transboundary fluxes to the upstream discharges are listed in table 3 the total transboundary flux total discharge from the river floodplain boundary into or out of the river is comparable to the upstream discharge and the implementation of the nwrpg will cause all transboundary fluxes to rise fig 7 this indicates that as the flow increases the river floodplain transboundary flux also increases under the average january discharge and average annual discharge the transboundary fluxes and the ratio rise together the ratios rise 3 17 times fig 7 a the connectivity of january was significantly enhanced in contrast during the flood season the transboundary fluxes although rising decline in proportion in river flood scenarios the water level was lower and the water flow path is not as smooth and straight as in the lake flood scenarios so the transboundary flux and the ratio of river flood are lower than both under lake flood and after the implementation of nwrpg 3 4 particles travel statistics in the river floodplain system the behavior of the deterministic particles is associated with the hydraulic conditions fig 8 represents the particle movement under different hydraulic conditions in january and under average annual discharge the nwrpg considerably slowed down the movement of particles which traveled a shorter distance during the same time interval figs 8 b1 2 c1 2 during flood season the discharge increased figs 8 b3 5 c3 5 and the particles started to enter the river floodplain interface at the mid channel bar under such circumstances the implementation of nwrpg will increase the discharge under every flood scenario and particles will travel a longer distance during the same time interval with respect to the pre project situation the particles in the region show a shorter time elapsed in the meantime there are significant increases in the number of particles passing through the floodplain under the river flood scenarios few particles passed over the mid channel bar of the left upstream floodplain because that in stream bar was only partially submerged fig 5 a1 2 and the water didn t pass significantly over the mid channel bar fig 6 a1 2 additionally the results of particle trajectory reveal certain critical aspects of the river floodplain exchange dynamics together with the flow field fig 6 the particle path lines fig 8 demonstrate that particles mostly crossed the river floodplain barrier at a relatively small angle which shows that the river floodplain exchange was mainly along the upstream and downstream directions rather than through the lateral flow this means that in this study the river floodplain exchange is determined by longitudinal flow connection and that the floodplain does not generally interact significantly with its immediate bordering stream reach but rather with reaches upstream and downstream this result is consistent with chen et al 2020 who did the particle analysis in a different curved compound channel both of our results show that in meandering compound channels the main characteristics of the flood flow path are controlled by the shortest path of the overbank flow a continuous line from upstream to downstream and the main flood path no longer follows the main channel the river floodplain exchange in all flood scenarios was predominantly through the shortest flow path the river floodplain exchange in high water situations is predominantly through the straightened flow path particle motions within the river floodplain system are analyzed using the particle travel distance ptd which is the total distance traveled by a particle across the floodplain of a river reach chen et al 2020 and the residence time rt of particles which is the amount of time they spend in the floodplain defne and ganju 2015 these metrics describe how the river and its floodplain are connected from a lagrangian point of view to test the frequency of particle exchange between the main channel and the floodplain the distribution of particle residence time rt and particle transport distance ptd on the left upstream floodplain fig 1 d was calculated since the river floodplain exchange flux at the left upstream floodplain is small in the january scenarios and at the average annual flow scenarios fig 7 only the flood inundation scenarios are considered here in the subsequent statistical analysis only particles that first entered and then left the floodplain were considered which means that those became stuck in the dry floodplains were excluded each particle calculated in the following analysis was weighted by the original water depth at the location where it was emitted to reflect the water column s properties the distributions of rt for 5 year 10 year and 20 year flood events are presented in fig 9 the rts for the different flood events follow an approximately skewed right distribution as the flow rate increases in lake flood the particle average residence time mrt decreases for instance mrt decreased from 3 176 s at a 5 year flood to 2 933 s at a 20 year flood the standard deviation sd of rt also decreases significantly with increasing flow indicating an increase in the uniformity of water mass movement under large floods due to the larger velocity of river flood scenarios their mrts are smaller than those of lake flood scenarios and the sds are smaller as well the river flood scenarios for 10 year and 20 year have similar rt distributions with mrts of 1933 s and 1907 s as well as sds of 433 s and 510 s respectively the implementation of nwrpg results in greater velocity the particles moving with the water body show smaller mrts and more uniform velocities as well as lower rt sds the distribution of ptd for 5 year 10 year and 20 year flood events is presented in fig 10 the ptds for the different flood events approximately follow the normal distribution closer than the rts in lake flood scenarios as the discharge increased the flow path became straight fig 8 b3 5 and the particle travel distance decreased fig 10 b1 3 in river flood scenarios the ptd was larger than that of lake flood scenarios but the sd was smaller like rt river flood scenarios for 10 yr and 20 yr showed close ptd distributions which may be due to the fact that the floodplains are still not fully inundated and the different river flood scenarios have similar flow structures the mean ptd after the implementation of nwrpg and for lake flood scenarios under different floods did not differ significantly the implementation of nwrpg results in a slight sd increase in ptd although the implementation of the nwrpg accelerated the velocity the particle flow path was as straight as for the lake flood scenarios resulting in a ptd distribution like that of the lake flood scenarios 4 discussion 4 1 projected effects of nwrpg implementation flood pulses are a major driver of improved habitat heterogeneity and diversity in floodplain hydrologic connectivity junk et al 1989 systematic assessment of the effects of hydrodynamic conditions and water resources management projects on river floodplain hydrologic connectivity is beneficial for understanding and improving the biodiversity of aquatic plants and animals in this study we found that the larger floods and the implementation of the nwrpg brought greater streamwise discharge to the floodplain this is expected to change the habitat heterogeneity of the floodplain lake flood corresponds to elevated water levels which enhances lateral connectivity during floods but reduces potential biological refuges which is further exacerbated by the implementation of the nwrpg regular flood events can effectively enhance the intensity of nutrient and organic matter exchange between the main channel and the floodplain and the connectivity of low lying water bodies in the floodplain to the main stem is positively correlated with species abundance mouw et al 2009 found that floodplain water and river water often interact and together serve as a river corridor where many invertebrates live mouw et al 2009 the implementation of the nwrpg also results in the permanent inundation of portions of the floodplain that would otherwise be exposed during the dry season in january which can also significantly alter local habitats previous studies yi et al 2017 indicated that the implementation of the water resources management projects changed the hydrological condition of the river the flow in the upstream reservoir area slows significantly even to zero resulting in sediment deposition and increases in phytoplankton and zooplankton when evaluating barrage structures such as gates it is generally considered necessary to ensure ecological baseflow to maintain upstream and downstream connectivity but some of the upstream river floodplains are also permanently submerged in this case as floodplains are permanently submerged some biogeochemical reactions cannot occur and the habitat for some organisms is missing however the aquatic environment can be maintained due to the elevated water level in the dry season during the dry season nwrpg tends to interfere with the natural flow of water in upstream streams this may be good for the riverine environment in terms of increasing connectivity 4 2 effects of natural and engineered hydraulic conditions on river floodplain connectivity the interactions between the river and the floodplain in a meandering compound channel are considered here the main channel floodplain exchange flux in the meandering compound channel is more from the upstream river midstream floodplain and downstream river connectivity due to the straight flow path fig 11 this implies a more intense and complex exchange between the main channel and the floodplain in the meandering river section the exchange during flooding is actually the upstream downstream connectivity that maintains the river floodplain connectivity this type of river morphology may serve many functions such as biogeochemical filters and the creation of favorable conditions for organisms matheus carnevali et al 2021 however artificial management of rivers such as channel straightening and extensive construction of embankments often diminishes the strength of water exchange dynamics and hydrological connectivity leading to lower levels of biodiversity modern river management has tried to restore lateral connectivity bolland et al 2012 but our work proves that it is also important to pay attention to the main channel floodplain longitudinal connectivity fig 11 in meandering channels during floods 4 3 limitations and future developments of this study there are limitations to this study the 2d approach for both the hydrodynamic and the particle tracking models is less accurate than 3d models in describing areas with large changes in riverbed elevation a 3d hydrodynamic model and particle tracking analysis should be carried out to obtain a more detailed picture of the river floodplain connectivity in the surface and bottom layers the flood driven submerged flow exchange processes in the river floodplain system also need to be further explored in addition the unsteady flow condition was not considered the assessment of river floodplain connectivity and the related material exchange during the unsteady process of flood rising and fall still needs further research the nwrpg is still in a planning stage in which it is difficult to consider the unsteady flow a post evaluation analysis could be carried out after the implementation of the nwrpg the study river reach is part of the ganjiang rive which feeds into the poyang lake which is the largest freshwater lake in the yangtze river basin and even in china poyang lake can be regarded as a compound river system which is a river in the dry season and a lake in the flood season yuan et al 2022 yuan et al 2021 after the implementation of the three gorges project the hydrological cycle in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river underwent a dramatic change fu et al 2010 xu et al 2013 the sediment concentration was sharply reduced yang et al 2014 the undercutting of clear water and other problems were initially highlighted zheng 2016 and many riverbanks collapsed chen et al 2018 the poyang lake hub project plhp is planned to be implemented in the poyang lake basin wu et al 2019 this is a major project that focuses on protecting water resources as well as the lake s ecological quality and navigation the impact of the new hydrological cycle due to plhp and nwrpg on the whole poyang lake basin still needs to be carefully assessed even considering the effect from the three gorges the plhp and other projects will increase the water level in the dry season and the assessment of the river floodplain connectivity and its impact on biogeochemistry still needs to be studied yao et al 2019 5 conclusions river channel floodplain hydrological connectivity during floods has an important role in flood control and river habitat assessment hydraulic projects often have a negative impact on hydrological connectivity several steady flow conditions are considered in the study changes in river hydrodynamics and particle motion due to the implementation of the nwrpg as well as to river flood and lake flood conditions were comparatively analyzed compared to the river flood scenarios during the lake flood scenarios the water level and inundated areas were larger whereas velocity decreased and the residence time rt of particles increased the particle travel distance ptd during the river flood scenarios was larger than during the lake flood scenarios the larger the flood the greater the transboundary flux between the river and the floodplain and the shorter the rt and ptd the implementation of the nwrpg resulted in the permanent inundation of part of the river floodplain causing some habitat loss due to the increase in discharge those projects will reduce the rt and cause a smaller sd of rt with little effect on the ptd distribution this study has improved the understanding of the river floodplain connectivity and provided technical guidance for the assessment of upstream hydrologic connectivity research on river floodplain connectivity and restoration methods that consider the effects of water resources management projects should continue as human use of river systems increases and standards for ecological restoration of rivers become more demanding credit authorship contribution statement

affect water quality and ecological processes in river systems fu et al 2020 tan et al 2021 the lateral exchange of water sediment nutrients and contaminants between a river and its floodplain is dependent on hydrodynamics and river morphology water resources management projects could drastically modify the hydrological conditions and impact the rivers hydrodynamics sediment transport and

channel and the floodplains at the interface between the floodplain and the main channel kelvin helmholtz kh instability causes a complex turbulent structure related to a series of vertically orientated vortices and streamwise orientated vortices located both in the floodplain and the main channel proust and nikora 2020 spiral vortices lai et al 2008 and coherent structures of various time and length scales xiao and wang 2007 are observed past studies on compound channels ding et al 2022 knight and demetriou 1983 shiono and knight 1991 focused on the impact of changes in the depth ratio and floodplain characteristics on hydrodynamic properties such as flow velocity distribution turbulent flow structure and boundary shear stress because investigating river floodplain connections during flooding conditions is extremely dangerous for instrumentation and researchers river floodplain interaction field studies are uncommon models based upon the shallow water equations are widely used on large scale free surface flow problems tan et al 2021 particle tracking methods have proven to be effective in delineating flow fields wang et al 2018 determining flow paths li et al 2008 and travel times jing et al 2021 these methods have also been used to study pollutant dispersion salamon et al 2006 sediment transport zhao et al 2011 oil spills goeury 2012 algal movement joly 2011 and connectivity patterns in the northern gulf of california marinone et al 2008 chen et al 2020 first proposed the use of a particle tracking simulation method to quantify flow dynamics between a river channel and its floodplains particle tracking methods are also able to figure out the water travel length and residence time inside the floodplains lowland rivers are often located in areas with a large population in which the conservation of good water quality levels is challenging this leads to the creation of projects to manage water resources which may change the way rivers and floodplains connect using hydrodynamic modeling and particle tracking analysis the present study investigates the hydrological connectivity of river floodplain systems under changing natural and engineered hydraulic conditions the ganjiang river is the largest tributary of the poyang lake basin and the fourth largest tributary of the yangtze river it flows from south to north through the entire territory of jiangxi province china the management of the ganjiang river is crucial to the hydrology and ecology of the poyang lake basin and even of the yangtze river basin to raise the water level during the low flow season the nanchang water resources project group nwrpg is being planned the main scientific objectives addressed in this study are to analyze the characteristics of river floodplain interactions under different flood characteristics evaluate the impact of the implementation of the nwrpg on river floodplain connectivity 2 method 2 1 study site the lower middle branch of ganjiang river the study was conducted at the lower middle branch of the ganjiang river in jiangxi china the ganjiang river flows north through the western part of jiangxi province before entering poyang lake and later the yangtze river fig 1 a this river provides water resources to the city of nanchang as well as acts as an ecological corridor for fish and other aquatic species floods in the ganjiang river can be generally divided into two types river flood and lake flood they have a different frequency the river flood refers to the flood in the ganjiang river but not in the poyang lake the lake flood means both the ganjiang river and the poyang lake are under flood conditions however due to uncontrolled river sand mining the low flow water level in the lower ganjiang river is lower than before water utilization conditions have deteriorated and the water resources for urban water supply and agricultural irrigation in the region are scarce in recent years several water resources management projects such as for flood control waterway management and environmental management have been implemented or planned in the ganjiang river basin liu 2018 the nanchang water resources project group nwrpg is being planned with four individual projects to raise the water level in the downstream ganjiang river during the low flow season the xiangshan project the lianxin project the nanxin project and the jili project see fig 1a for the positions of the corresponding projects the main hydraulic structures used in the nwrpg include gates ship locks and fish tunnels etc from april to july i e the flood season the gates will be fully open from august to march of the following year the river level will be controlled after the completion of these projects it is anticipated that the water level will rise and the discharge will increase during the dry season while the water level will remain stable during the flood season 2 2 governing equations for fluid flow and particle transport the two dimensional shallow water equations swes are implemented for hydrodynamic modeling because of their ability to accurately simulate surface hydraulics in river floodplain systems they have achieved widespread application in a variety of complex free surface flows cao et al 2020 he et al 2018 lim et al 2019 tang et al 2020 1 h t u h h d i v u s h 2 u t u u g z x s x 1 h d i v h ν ν

ganjiang river is limited inside the main channel having a curved planform in a curved channel the flow speeds up in the direction of the curve and centrifugal forces act in proportion to the average speed blankaert et al 2006 the development and decay processes of secondary flows in curved channels can be accounted for with the transport equation for streamwise vorticity bernard and schneider

lagrangian particle tracking study to examine how flow parcels move through the study region here we consider observations of passive particles transported by the river flow the state of the flow is described in eulerian coordinates by the shallow water equations the link between the lagrangian data and the classical eulerian variables of the shallow water model is made by the following two

code that uses the fourth order of the runge kutta method to track particles was prepared in house in a depth averaged shallow water flow field each 2 d particle emitted at a given horizontal plane point is associated with the scalar property flow depth which corresponds to a vertical line or water column in the flow domain therefore statistics for a large number of two dimensional particles weighted by their flow depths are thus capable of representing the actual dynamics of the water body in the two dimensional plane integrating along the depth shows the properties of a two dimensional particle that represents a body of water chen et al 2020 19 f i 0 h f i d z where i is the particle number f is the property for a water column that can be calculated by integrating f along the depth

the j th unit volume in the domain f i is the average value of the property f for the water column h i j is the height of the j th unit volume this weighted analysis approach applies to the statistical properties of 2 d particles 2 4 boundary settings and equations solving the boundary conditions for the numerical domain are set as steady flow which are presented in fig 2 b on the upstream boundary a specified discharge is prescribed while the corresponding water level is assigned on the downstream boundary the right or left boundary conditions relative to the flow direction of the model domain are considered no flow boundary conditions the system of partial differential equations represented in eq 1 11 was solved with telemac 2d a shallow water equations finite element model fem solver of the integrated free surface flow suite telemac mascaret which was developed initially by the national hydraulics and environment laboratory lnhe of the research and development directorate of the french electricity board edf r d france a conjugate gradient method was used to solve the hydrodynamic propagation step and the standard k ε model system hervouet 2007 the surface water modeling system sms was used for triangle mesh generation after format conversion with blue kenue telemac2d can use the meshes generated by sms a higher density of elements was constructed in the vicinity of the main channel to obtain a more accurate solution fig 2b the model domain is 21 000 m in length and 420 1250 m in width a grid refinement was first conducted to ensure mesh independence of the results blocken and gualtieri 2012 three meshes with element nodes of 4846 6460 and 24 959 were generated respectively table 1 compares the surface level and velocity of p1 fig 2b results with a mesh of 7000 nodes and above were mesh independent finally a mesh with 48 818 cells and 24 959 nodes was used to provide a more realistic flow structure and smooth particle trajectories in the channel the minimum element size was 25 m and as this length gradually increased from channel to floodplain the maximum size was 45 m the simulation was carried out over one year for a wider range of the river reach and included the upper part of the study area and other branches of the ganjiang river to use the data from more gauging stations for validation fig 2a as shown in fig 1d the left upstream floodplain is larger than the right downstream floodplain and the downstream floodplain on the right was found to be permanently flooded after the implementation of the nwrpg in the subsequent study therefore we conducted the particle tracking analysis in the area upstream of the left upstream floodplain different hydrological conditions and different effects from the river flood the lake flood and from the nwrpg were considered as scenarios table 1 according to the historical hydrological series the average january runoff representing the dry season flow is 151 97 m3 s the annual average runoff is 491 168 m3 s and the 5 yr flood 10 yr flood and 20 yr flood discharges are 4 338 68 4 898 08 and 5 338 53 m3 s respectively the river flood effects are considered for a 10 yr flood and 20 yr flood the discharge is the same as in the lake flood while the water level is lower due to the implementation of nwrpg the corresponding flows change at different frequencies from the perspective of water resource availability the dry season and average annual flows are lower than before but water levels are higher during the flood season the water level is controlled at the same level as the lake flood but the discharge increases the model scenarios are introduced for the setup of model scenarios table 2 and 12 runs were carried out for each flood event we released a total of 3 000 particles from the upstream section of the left upstream floodplain 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation the 2013 hydrological data was used for model calibration the model was calibrated by changing bed roughness manning coefficient n after validation the manning coefficient was set to 0 024 which is similar to the one used in the poyang lake model xiao et al 2022 the trends of the numerical model and the measured water level in four gauging stations are basically consistent the nash coefficients are above 0 99 and the maximum water level error does not exceed 0 1 m fig 3 the results show reasonable agreement between the model results and measured data for model validation three hydrological tests were conducted in july 2019 waizhou discharge 3 780 m3 s september 2020 waizhou discharge 2 800 m3 s and october 2020 waizhou discharge 470 m3 s at thirteen survey sections fig 1b and c there are 12 or 13 measurement points available for each survey section the cross sectional average water levels and the vertically averaged streamwise velocity were measured the hydrodynamic processes in july 2019 and september october 2020 were calculated by the large model and the results were compared with the measured cross sectional average water levels and vertically averaged streamwise velocity fig 4 both the calculated water level and velocity show reasonable agreement with the measured data the difference between the calculated and measured values of individual measurement points is mostly due to the time and topography of the tests 3 2 flood inundation and flow velocity distribution the map of the water depth and the flooded area where gray indicates areas not flooded and color indicates the water depth of the inundation area is presented in fig 5 in january scenarios the flow passes in the main channel below the left upstream floodplain and in the upper and lower main channels of the right downstream floodplain fig 5b1 the left upstream floodplain has some obvious isolated patches in january scenarios these small wetland areas can play a vital role in preserving the ecological quality of rivers at the average annual flow the flow overflows the two main channels above and below the left floodplain and the right downstream floodplain is mostly inundated fig 5b2 the whole model domain is covered by water flow under the flood action of lake flood fig 5 b3 5 under the action of river flood the left upstream floodplain still has partial outcropping fig 5 a1 2 which could be a refuge for organisms after the implementation of the nwrpg water depth is increased for all conditions fig 5 c the main channel above the left upstream floodplain and the right downstream are always flooded the river loses some of the upland areas that can be exposed during january the velocity field is displayed in fig 6 the implementation of the nwrpg reduces the velocity in january and the average annual flow fig 6 c1 2 during floods the main channel above the left upstream floodplain becomes the main overflow channel as the flood water tends to straighten out figs 6 a1 2 b3 5 c3 5 due to the much lower water level the velocity under river flood conditions is generally greater than under lake flood conditions fig 6 a1 2 from the perspective of the january and average annual flow the implementation of nwrpg results in increased water depth fig 5 c1 2 and lower velocity fig 6 c1 2 due to the increased discharge in the middle branch under the nwrpg the velocity becomes larger in the flood season fig 6 c3 4 3 3 effect of the hydraulic conditions on lateral flow exchange the transboundary flux is calculated by integrating unit discharge u h along riverbank lines 21 q int u h n d l where u is the velocity vector h is the water depth and n is the normal vector of bank line l pointing to the floodplain side since the right downstream floodplain is permanently inundated only the transboundary fluxes of the left upstream floodplain were analyzed in the present study the transboundary flux of river floodplain is presented in fig 7 the bank line of the left upstream floodplain is marked on fig 1d the ratios of the transboundary fluxes to the upstream discharges are listed in table 3 the total transboundary flux total discharge from the river floodplain boundary into or out of the river is comparable to the upstream discharge and the implementation of the nwrpg will cause all transboundary fluxes to rise fig 7 this indicates that as the flow increases the river floodplain transboundary flux also increases under the average january discharge and average annual discharge the transboundary fluxes and the ratio rise together the ratios rise 3 17 times fig 7 a the connectivity of january was significantly enhanced in contrast during the flood season the transboundary fluxes although rising decline in proportion in river flood scenarios the water level was lower and the water flow path is not as smooth and straight as in the lake flood scenarios so the transboundary flux and the ratio of river flood are lower than both under lake flood and after the implementation of nwrpg 3 4 particles travel statistics in the river floodplain system the behavior of the deterministic particles is associated with the hydraulic conditions fig 8 represents the particle movement under different hydraulic conditions in january and under average annual discharge the nwrpg considerably slowed down the movement of particles which traveled a shorter distance during the same time interval figs 8 b1 2 c1 2 during flood season the discharge increased figs 8 b3 5 c3 5 and the particles started to enter the river floodplain interface at the mid channel bar under such circumstances the implementation of nwrpg will increase the discharge under every flood scenario and particles will travel a longer distance during the same time interval with respect to the pre project situation the particles in the region show a shorter time elapsed in the meantime there are significant increases in the number of particles passing through the floodplain under the river flood scenarios few particles passed over the mid channel bar of the left upstream floodplain because that in stream bar was only partially submerged fig 5 a1 2 and the water didn t pass significantly over the mid channel bar fig 6 a1 2 additionally the results of particle trajectory reveal certain critical aspects of the river floodplain exchange dynamics together with the flow field fig 6 the particle path lines fig 8 demonstrate that particles mostly crossed the river floodplain barrier at a relatively small angle which shows that the river floodplain exchange was mainly along the upstream and downstream directions rather than through the lateral flow this means that in this study the river floodplain exchange is determined by longitudinal flow connection and that the floodplain does not generally interact significantly with its immediate bordering stream reach but rather with reaches upstream and downstream this result is consistent with chen et al 2020 who did the particle analysis in a different curved compound channel both of our results show that in meandering compound channels the main characteristics of the flood flow path are controlled by the shortest path of the overbank flow a continuous line from upstream to downstream and the main flood path no longer follows the main channel the river floodplain exchange in all flood scenarios was predominantly through the shortest flow path the river floodplain exchange in high water situations is predominantly through the straightened flow path particle motions within the river floodplain system are analyzed using the particle travel distance ptd which is the total distance traveled by a particle across the floodplain of a river reach chen et al 2020 and the residence time rt of particles which is the amount of time they spend in the floodplain defne and ganju 2015 these metrics describe how the river and its floodplain are connected from a lagrangian point of view to test the frequency of particle exchange between the main channel and the floodplain the distribution of particle residence time rt and particle transport distance ptd on the left upstream floodplain fig 1 d was calculated since the river floodplain exchange flux at the left upstream floodplain is small in the january scenarios and at the average annual flow scenarios fig 7 only the flood inundation scenarios are considered here in the subsequent statistical analysis only particles that first entered and then left the floodplain were considered which means that those became stuck in the dry floodplains were excluded each particle calculated in the following analysis was weighted by the original water depth at the location where it was emitted to reflect the water column s properties the distributions of rt for 5 year 10 year and 20 year flood events are presented in fig 9 the rts for the different flood events follow an approximately skewed right distribution as the flow rate increases in lake flood the particle average residence time mrt decreases for instance mrt decreased from 3 176 s at a 5 year flood to 2 933 s at a 20 year flood the standard deviation sd of rt also decreases significantly with increasing flow indicating an increase in the uniformity of water mass movement under large floods due to the larger velocity of river flood scenarios their mrts are smaller than those of lake flood scenarios and the sds are smaller as well the river flood scenarios for 10 year and 20 year have similar rt distributions with mrts of 1933 s and 1907 s as well as sds of 433 s and 510 s respectively the implementation of nwrpg results in greater velocity the particles moving with the water body show smaller mrts and more uniform velocities as well as lower rt sds the distribution of ptd for 5 year 10 year and 20 year flood events is presented in fig 10 the ptds for the different flood events approximately follow the normal distribution closer than the rts in lake flood scenarios as the discharge increased the flow path became straight fig 8 b3 5 and the particle travel distance decreased fig 10 b1 3 in river flood scenarios the ptd was larger than that of lake flood scenarios but the sd was smaller like rt river flood scenarios for 10 yr and 20 yr showed close ptd distributions which may be due to the fact that the floodplains are still not fully inundated and the different river flood scenarios have similar flow structures the mean ptd after the implementation of nwrpg and for lake flood scenarios under different floods did not differ significantly the implementation of nwrpg results in a slight sd increase in ptd although the implementation of the nwrpg accelerated the velocity the particle flow path was as straight as for the lake flood scenarios resulting in a ptd distribution like that of the lake flood scenarios 4 discussion 4 1 projected effects of nwrpg implementation flood pulses are a major driver of improved habitat heterogeneity and diversity in floodplain hydrologic connectivity junk et al 1989 systematic assessment of the effects of hydrodynamic conditions and water resources management projects on river floodplain hydrologic connectivity is beneficial for understanding and improving the biodiversity of aquatic plants and animals in this study we found that the larger floods and the implementation of the nwrpg brought greater streamwise discharge to the floodplain this is expected to change the habitat heterogeneity of the floodplain lake flood corresponds to elevated water levels which enhances lateral connectivity during floods but reduces potential biological refuges which is further exacerbated by the implementation of the nwrpg regular flood events can effectively enhance the intensity of nutrient and organic matter exchange between the main channel and the floodplain and the connectivity of low lying water bodies in the floodplain to the main stem is positively correlated with species abundance mouw et al 2009 found that floodplain water and river water often interact and together serve as a river corridor where many invertebrates live mouw et al 2009 the implementation of the nwrpg also results in the permanent inundation of portions of the floodplain that would otherwise be exposed during the dry season in january which can also significantly alter local habitats previous studies yi et al 2017 indicated that the implementation of the water resources management projects changed the hydrological condition of the river the flow in the upstream reservoir area slows significantly even to zero resulting in sediment deposition and increases in phytoplankton and zooplankton when evaluating barrage structures such as gates it is generally considered necessary to ensure ecological baseflow to maintain upstream and downstream connectivity but some of the upstream river floodplains are also permanently submerged in this case as floodplains are permanently submerged some biogeochemical reactions cannot occur and the habitat for some organisms is missing however the aquatic environment can be maintained due to the elevated water level in the dry season during the dry season nwrpg tends to interfere with the natural flow of water in upstream streams this may be good for the riverine environment in terms of increasing connectivity 4 2 effects of natural and engineered hydraulic conditions on river floodplain connectivity the interactions between the river and the floodplain in a meandering compound channel are considered here the main channel floodplain exchange flux in the meandering compound channel is more from the upstream river midstream floodplain and downstream river connectivity due to the straight flow path fig 11 this implies a more intense and complex exchange between the main channel and the floodplain in the meandering river section the exchange during flooding is actually the upstream downstream connectivity that maintains the river floodplain connectivity this type of river morphology may serve many functions such as biogeochemical filters and the creation of favorable conditions for organisms matheus carnevali et al 2021 however artificial management of rivers such as channel straightening and extensive construction of embankments often diminishes the strength of water exchange dynamics and hydrological connectivity leading to lower levels of biodiversity modern river management has tried to restore lateral connectivity bolland et al 2012 but our work proves that it is also important to pay attention to the main channel floodplain longitudinal connectivity fig 11 in meandering channels during floods 4 3 limitations and future developments of this study there are limitations to this study the 2d approach for both the hydrodynamic and the particle tracking models is less accurate than 3d models in describing areas with large changes in riverbed elevation a 3d hydrodynamic model and particle tracking analysis should be carried out to obtain a more detailed picture of the river floodplain connectivity in the surface and bottom layers the flood driven submerged flow exchange processes in the river floodplain system also need to be further explored in addition the unsteady flow condition was not considered the assessment of river floodplain connectivity and the related material exchange during the unsteady process of flood rising and fall still needs further research the nwrpg is still in a planning stage in which it is difficult to consider the unsteady flow a post evaluation analysis could be carried out after the implementation of the nwrpg the study river reach is part of the ganjiang rive which feeds into the poyang lake which is the largest freshwater lake in the yangtze river basin and even in china poyang lake can be regarded as a compound river system which is a river in the dry season and a lake in the flood season yuan et al 2022 yuan et al 2021 after the implementation of the three gorges project the hydrological cycle in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river underwent a dramatic change fu et al 2010 xu et al 2013 the sediment concentration was sharply reduced yang et al 2014 the undercutting of clear water and other problems were initially highlighted zheng 2016 and many riverbanks collapsed chen et al 2018 the poyang lake hub project plhp is planned to be implemented in the poyang lake basin wu et al 2019 this is a major project that focuses on protecting water resources as well as the lake s ecological quality and navigation the impact of the new hydrological cycle due to plhp and nwrpg on the whole poyang lake basin still needs to be carefully assessed even considering the effect from the three gorges the plhp and other projects will increase the water level in the dry season and the assessment of the river floodplain connectivity and its impact on biogeochemistry still needs to be studied yao et al 2019 5 conclusions river channel floodplain hydrological connectivity during floods has an important role in flood control and river habitat assessment hydraulic projects often have a negative impact on hydrological connectivity several steady flow conditions are considered in the study changes in river hydrodynamics and particle motion due to the implementation of the nwrpg as well as to river flood and lake flood conditions were comparatively analyzed compared to the river flood scenarios during the lake flood scenarios the water level and inundated areas were larger whereas velocity decreased and the residence time rt of particles increased the particle travel distance ptd during the river flood scenarios was larger than during the lake flood scenarios the larger the flood the greater the transboundary flux between the river and the floodplain and the shorter the rt and ptd the implementation of the nwrpg resulted in the permanent inundation of part of the river floodplain causing some habitat loss due to the increase in discharge those projects will reduce the rt and cause a smaller sd of rt with little effect on the ptd distribution this study has improved the understanding of the river floodplain connectivity and provided technical guidance for the assessment of upstream hydrologic connectivity research on river floodplain connectivity and restoration methods that consider the effects of water resources management projects should continue as human use of river systems increases and standards for ecological restoration of rivers become more demanding credit authorship contribution statement

monitoring and water resources management as an early spaceborne gnss r observatory the techdemosat 1 tds 1 in the united kingdom provided diverse and large observations supporting retrieval however tds 1 retired at the end of 2019 and it has serious limitations in terms of coverage chen et al 2022 launched in late 2016 nasa s cyclone global navigation satellite system cygnss is able to provide 6 hourly high frequency on a localized earth scale revisited observation using eight small satellites orbiting the tropics the cygnss has provided a large amount of earth observation data consisting of frequent geospatial footprints and spatiotemporal revisited observations since 2017 wang et al 2019 gleason et al 2019 previous studies focused on obtaining soil moisture products with greater spatial coverage and higher temporal and spatial resolution driven by high spatial and temporal resolution data xiao et al 2022a b li et al 2022a b lee and kim 2022 manoj et al 2022 lee et al 2022 several previous studies on gnss r focused on obtaining long term cyclone global navigation satellite system observations interferometric reflectometry cygnss r based soil moisture products al khaldi et al 2019 chew and small 2018 clarizia et al 2019 eroglu et al 2019 kim and lakshmi 2018 senyurek et al 2020 m m nabi et al 2022 cygnss level 3 soil moisture version 1 0 chew and small 2018 is a soil moisture product based on cygnss l1 sdr inversion provided by the university corporation for atmospheric research ucar and the university of colorado at boulder cu it is the first ubiquitously released cygnss r based soil moisture product worldwide which has been distributed by nasa physical oceanography distributed active archive centers po daac the soil moisture accuracy of cygnss r based ssm should be comprehensively verified with a wide range of possible methods soil moisture accuracy verification is constrained by obtaining reliable estimates of ground truth soil moisture making it difficult to obtain large scale global scale true soil moisture measurements crow et al 2012 although ground based observation sites provide local small scale soil moisture measurements assessments can be affected by mismatches in spatial scale representation draper et al 2013 triple collection tc stoffelen et al 1998 is a method that can provide error estimates for key environmental variables on the earth s surface and has been widely used in soil moisture evaluation and assessment gruber et al 2017 the tc method is suitable to be applied to the error assessment of heterologous soil moisture as it forms a set of datasets comprising three collocated and error independent data for juxtaposition evaluation therefore datasets from three different sources can be cross referenced however the relative error measure is constrained by choice of the true reference dataset and its own multiplicative and additive errors crow et al 2012 subsequently extended triple collocation mccoll et al 2014 can reduce the influence of true observation errors by forming hypothetical true observations without using any of the datasets as the true observation reference in our study the tc method was used to evaluate satellite based soil moisture from smap and soil moisture retrieved by cygnss r and merged soil moisture from european space agency s climate change initiative esa cci specifically a new evaluation triplet is cygnss r based merged and in situ tc method cmid tc it is provided to incorporate site observations and evaluate cygnss r based errors on a local scale we also analyze the error indicators to further evaluate the performance of different products over different land cover types based on in situ and tc evaluations from the perspective of temporal variation and spatial accuracy of soil moisture on a quasi global qg scale comparing the different performances in various regions and under diverse land cover types may be able to provide new insights for improving gnss r based soil moisture estimates to our knowledge this study is the first attempt to use tc to obtain a qg scale cygnss r based ssm error and correlation evaluation and compare it with smap and esa cci ssm the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the features of the qg area and the datasets section 3 describes the spatial temporal resampling method extended triple collocation and non tc based evaluation metrics for soil moisture assessment section 4 presents the assessment results of soil moisture based on cmid based etc discusses the assessment results and error sources of the two strategies and proposes an outlook for research in the future finally section 5 concludes the study 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area specifically the research area is the qg area between 38 n and 38 s and between 135 e and 164 w shown in fig 1 because the coverage of cygnss soil moisture is the qg area in this study the accuracy of cygnss r ssm soil moisture is verified and compared with satellite based soil moisture and merged soil moisture 2 2 gnss r based ssm retrievals from cygnss cygnss level 3 soil moisture version 1 0 is a gnss r based l band bistatic radar dataset released by ucar cu providing daily and sub daily estimates of ssm at a 6 h discretization for most of the subtropics from march 18 2017 to august 16 2020 chew and small 2018 this dataset uses a linear regression model between the smap soil moisture and cygnss reflectivity to solve for daily and sub daily soil moisture retrieved from effective reflectivity calculated from cygnss chew and small 2020 the dataset is gridded to 36 km easev2 grids to be consistent with smap ssm the data are archived and can be freely accessed from https podaac jpl nasa gov owing to the asynchronous nature of the orbits of the gps transmitters and cygnss receivers in the bistatic radar link temporal sampling is best described by a probability distribution of the revisit time at each location within the 38 latitude coverage area the median value of the revisit frequency is 2 h and the mean revisit frequency is 6 h traditional remote sensing observations periodically observe a specific location at a specific time in a day in the form of a push broom cycle with a consistent revisit frequency on the contrary gnss r uses ground reflected signals as observation signals and the specular reflection points on the earth s surface are determined by the positions of the transmitting and receiving satellites the observed footprints formed by gnss r on the surface present a statistical pseudo random distribution and aggregate with the increase of observations to present a complete reflected signal therefore the daily records of gnss r ssm represent the soil moisture average for that day cygnss ssm retrievals are collected from april 1 2017 to march 31 2020 for validation data records at each 6 hours discretization of time were aggregated to a daily average considering that cygnss functions as a constellation of passive sensors that receive the signal of surface reflected gps pulses chew et al 2020 cygnss ssm can be considered as ssm 0 5 cm 2 3 ground based ssm observations from ismn the ground based ssm observations for validation were based on data archived from international soil moisture network ismn dorigo et al 2013 eight soil moisture observation networks are used in the study including the soil climate analysis network scan schaefer et al 2007 the snowpack telemetry snotel network leavesley et al 2008 the u s climate reference network uscrn bell et al 2013 the pbo h2o network larson et al 2008 the oznet network smith et al 2012 the amma catch network galle et al 2018 the maqu network su et al 2011 and the naqu network su et al 2011 the in situ observations were downloaded from the ismn website portal https ismn geo tuwien ac at en from april 1 2017 to march 31 2020 a summary of the used in situ station networks is listed in table 1 in the supporting information the ismn in situ soil moisture measurements from 0 to 5 cm or 5 cm layer were used in the assessment the quality flag in the ismn data is applied to select the data points with good quality dorigo et al 2013 the in situ data are filtered to ensure that at least 100 days of observations are available kim et al 2020 2 4 satellite based ssm retrievals from smap satellite based ssm has been available from the smap l3 global daily 36 km easev2 grid soil moisture product spl3smp version 8 since march 31 2015 o neill p e et al 2018 smap ssm provide descending orbit data at 6 00 am and the ascending orbit data at 18 00 pm smap ssm observations are collected from april 1 2017 to march 31 2020 through the nasa national snow and ice data center distributed active archive center nsidc daac https nsidc org data spl3smp the smap quality flag is used to ensure that only records that are recommended for retrieval were used in this study o neill p e et al 2018 2 5 merged ssm from esa cci soil moisture cci combined product version 05 3 dorigo et al 2017 is a merged dataset created as a part of the european space agency s esa soil moisture essential climate variable ecv climate change initiative cci project this dataset includes level 2 scatterometer and radiometer soil moisture products derived from the ami ws ascat smmr ssm i tmi amsr e windsat amsr2 smos and smap and fused by defining a uniform standard reference time and temporal resolution it provides global coverage of ssm at a spatial resolution of 0 25 and at a temporal resolution of daily centered at 0 00 utc in this study esa cci ssm observations are collected from april 1 2017 to march 31 2020 through https www esa soilmoisture cci org esa cci ssm are further regridded to 36 km easev2 grids to be consistent with cygnss r ssm and smap ssm considering the scale difference between satellite based gnss r retrieval measurements and merged soil moisture products 2 6 auxiliary data landcover data were used to analyze soil moisture accuracy under different land cover conditions modis s landcover product mcd12c1 version 6 https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov friedl et al 2010 was used to provide landcover information at 0 05 degree spatial resolution at annual intervals the product provides land cover in six different classification schemes and the igbp classification scheme is applied in our study the mcd12c1 product incorporates the 17 class international geosphere biosphere program igbp that is simplified into 6 major types except for permanent wetlands permanent snow and ice and water bodies table 2 this study only used the 6 major types for the assessments in this study landcover from mcd12c1 are also collected from 2017 to 2020 and regridded to 36 km easev2 grids 3 methodology 3 1 spatial temporal resampling for each day starting from the time frame center at 0 00 utc observations within 12 h as the time sampling window are considered first the daily temporal resolution is chosen as the time baseline since the temporal resolution of smap and esa cci ssm products is daily although cygnss r based ssm product provides both 6 hourly and daily temporal resolution products smap and esa cci only have soil moisture products with daily minimum temporal resolution second the reference time for the assessment is set at 0 00 utc to be consistent with the esa cci products which are provided at a temporal resolution of daily centered at 0 00 utc to be specific the ismn in situ daily soil moisture time series are constructed with respect to the 12 h windows centered at 0 00 utc using all hours of data the local equatorial overpass time of smap ssm is converted to utc first then the smap daily composite soil moisture estimates are reconstructed within a 12 h window centered at 0 00 utc using their observations from both the ascending and descending modes cygnss r soil moisture is provided with a 6 hour temporal resolution starting at 0 00 utc for every 6 hour period and also reconstructed within a 12 h window centered at 0 00 utc these sparsely distributed sites have been widely used to validate grid based soil moisture xu 2020 xu et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2022 xu et al 2021a b to mitigate scaling differences between the point based in situ measurements and grid based soil moisture products in situ sites that have standard deviations less than 0 1 with cygnss soil moisture and esa cci soil moisture are removed xu et al 2021a b considering the situation of multiple stations in a sparse grid the station with the highest correlation with the grid based soil moisture in the coarse grid is selected dorigo et al 2017 3 2 triple collocation tc method stoffelen 1998 is an uncertainty estimation method for estimating the random errors of three mutually independent measurement systems the premise of the application of this data set is that the data of the three measurement systems are independent and linearly related to the hypothetical true value moreover the errors of the three measurement systems are independent of each other and the hypothetical true value the linear error model for soil moisture evaluation is presented as follows 1 ϑ i ϑ i ε i α i β i t ε i where ϑ i i 1 2 3 are three sets of juxtaposed independent measurement systems corresponding to gnss r soil moisture satellite remote sensing soil moisture products and in situ soil moisture or fused soil moisture products t is the true soil moisture α i and β i are the additive and multiplicative deviations of the dataset relative to the true soil moisture signal in the ordinary least squares modeling respectively and ε i is the additional zero mean random noise the error estimation equation for calculating the rmse of the three groups of soil moisture by tc is obtained by determining the hypothetical true value 2 σ ε i σ ϑ 1 2 σ ϑ 1 ϑ 2 σ ϑ 1 ϑ 3 σ ϑ 2 ϑ 3 σ ϑ 2 2 σ ϑ 2 ϑ 1 σ ϑ 2 ϑ 3 σ ϑ 1 ϑ 3 σ ϑ 3 2 σ ϑ 3 ϑ 1 σ ϑ 3 ϑ 2 σ ϑ 1 ϑ 2 where σ ε i is the random error variance of dataset ϑ i i 1 2 3 σ ϑ 1 2 σ ϑ 2 2 and σ ϑ 3 2 are the data variance of ϑ i i 1 2 3 respectively σ ϑ 1 ϑ 2 σ ϑ 1 ϑ 3 and σ ϑ 2 ϑ 3 are the covariance of ϑ 1 and ϑ 2 ϑ 1 and ϑ 3 and ϑ 2 and ϑ 3 respectively the correlation coefficient can be derived from the measurement system with respect to the unknown target by the extended tc approach mccoll et al 2014 the unbiased signal to noise ratio provides a complementary perspective compared with the rmse in addition extended tc method has the ability to provide different perspectives for verification results 3 ρ t ϑ i 2 β t 2 σ ϑ i 2 β t 2 σ ϑ i 2 σ ε i 2 snr ub snr ub 1 4 snr ub var i var ε i β t 2 σ ϑ i 2 σ ε i 2 where ρ t ϑ i 2 is the squared correlation coefficient and snr ub is the unbiased signal to noise ratio 3 3 non tc based evaluation metrics four metrics are introduced to validate the accuracy of cygnss r based ssm and other ssm in this study including pearson correlation coefficient root mean square error rmse unbiased rmse ubrmse and bias pearson correlation coefficient is used to measure the degree of linear correlation between site observations and cyngss r based ssm rmse measures the deviation between cygnss r based ssm and other soil moisture including in situ measurements or ssm from different sources bias represents the systematic deviation between cygnss r based ssm and in situ measurement ubrmse is adopted to evaluate the absolute deviation of cygnss r based and in situ measurement better as the bias of rmse is eliminated these indicators can be calculated as follows 5 r 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x σ x y i y σ y 6 r m s e i 1 n x i y i 2 n 7 b i a s 1 n i 1 n x i y i 8 u b r m s e i 1 n x i x y i y 2 n where x i and y i represent two different types of soil moisture data such as satellite observations and in situ ground truth data n is the total number of observations x and y σ x and σ y represent the mean and standard deviation sd of the data respectively 4 results and discussions 4 1 temporal pattern of soil moisture fig 2 shows the regional average daily ssm over the study period generally the time series fluctuation trends and amplitudes of three soil moisture are relatively similar the estimated values of cygnss ssm and smap ssm are closer since a linear relationship between the smap soil moisture and cygnss reflectivity is used to derive cygnss ssm chew and small 2018 which is different from esa cci ssm being lower than the other two products in north america asia and south america in asia and north america cygnss r based ssm can capture evident seasonal changes in addition the seasonal variabilities in africa and oceania are more volatile whereas the seasonal variabilities trends captured in europe are smaller than the esa cci ssm and in south america seasonal variabilities are gentle 4 2 in situ assessment the results of the validation of the cygnss ssm using in situ sites are given as follows fig 3 shows the box plot of the error validation using site validation for cygnss r based ssm compared with smap ssm with a total of 332 matching valid sites the cross symbol represents the mean value and the line in the boxplot represents the median the correlation of cygnss ssm was lower than that of smap ssm in all regions in asia and africa ubrmse of cygnss ssm was higher than that of smap ssm in north america ubrmse of cygnss ssm was slightly higher than that of smap ssm however better ubrmse was achieved in oceania rmse and bias have a similar distribution fig 4 shows the results of classifying the site verification results of gnss r based ssm according to different land covers overall cygnss r based ssm has better validation accuracy in cropland and bare land but there may be overestimation in forested areas in the gnss r soil moisture open water will have a strong influence on the specular reflection points so the accuracy of the water mask will affect the inversion results optical water masks were used in the cygnss r based ssm inversion algorithm because the optical data properties underestimate the soil moisture under vegetation 4 3 cmid based tc assessment the introduction of merged based ssm into the triplet method can estimate random errors compared with merged soil moisture fig 5 shows the error standard deviation sd statistic of ssm based on etc with a combined cmid based dataset formed from cygnss r based ssm merged ssm and in situ observations the sd of cygnss r ssm was higher than that of esa cci ssm with an average of 0 053 in the qg area with an average sd of 0 069 low error sd statistic is shown in north america for cygnss r ssm and a high error sd statistic for cygnss r ssm is seen in asia africa and oceania the influence of ground noise may introduce errors in some specific regions in cygnss r based ssm in land calibration additional empirical calibration of gps transmit power may cause differences because of error uncertainty ruf et al 2018 2019 fig 6 depicts the correlation coefficient results obtained by applying the etc validation on the combined validation dataset for global and regional cygnss r ssm achieved a relatively higher correlation followed by esa cci ssm 0 62 exhibiting an average correlation of 0 64 in north america and oceania cygnss achieves higher temporal correlations than esa cci the correlation coefficient is generally lower in asia and africa than in esa cci the results of standard deviations and correlation coefficients for different land cover based on the cmid based etc are shown in fig 7 cygnss r ssm demonstrates higher accuracy than esa cci over savanna and shrubland low accuracy is seen in the grassland cropland forest and barren in terms of forests cygnss r ssm underestimates ssm which may be greatly affected by the biased surface temperature and other potential factors fan et al 2020 cygnss r ssm obtains a higher correlation coefficient than esa cci over grassland savanna shrubland and cropland in barren and forest the correlation coefficient was lower than esa cci overall cygnss r ssm shows the potential to capture higher precision and temporal trends in lightly vegetated areas 4 4 comparison of in situ assessment and tc analysis the results of cygnss soil moisture based on site verification are similar to the results of the triple combination the accuracy of cygnss ssm is improved but has a relative loss in correlation at the same time the combination of cygnss esa cci and in situ supplemented the assessment results of cygnss ssm compared with the merged soil moisture source ubrmse is adopted to evaluate the absolute deviation as the bias of rmse is eliminated the triple collocation analysis can get the random error between the statistical dataset and the ideal reality and measure the degree of variation or dispersion of the dataset the results of the in situ assessment are also different from those obtained from the cmid based tc evaluation the accuracy of cygnss is higher than smap in in situ assessment tc analysis showed that cygnss could capture a higher temporal correlation in soil moisture fusion the correlation coefficients obtained by in situ assessment and triple combination are different since there are representative errors between point based observations and grid based retrievals although the sites are sparsely distributed the triple collocation method deflates the accuracy by inexplicitly utilizing an ideal truth reference the in situ assessment results are complementary to the triple combination method in the systematic error estimation at the local scale as it calculates the absolute error of the dataset 5 conclusions in this study cygnss r ssm are validated at a quasi global scale and the accuracy is compared with smap and esa cci ssm based on in situ based validation and tc based evaluation a triplet dataset composed of cygnss r merged and in situ tc method cmid tc is used to validate and evaluate cygnss r based ssm based on tc methods both in situ based validation and tc based evaluation methods are used to analyze the results on different land cover results show that cygnss r based ssm achieve higher absolute accuracy than smap satellite based ssm cygnss r based ssm achieves worse accuracy indicators than smap ssm on grassland savanna shrubland cropland and forest but has slightly better accuracy than smap on barren hence less vegetation cover and surface water are allowed for clearer specular points in the surface fresnel reflection area the evaluation result of the forest type has relatively bad performance because of the complexity of forest tree morphology and accumulation affecting the gnss r signal results from tc analysis show that cygnss r ssm outperforms esa cci ssm in terms of capturing the temporal trends of soil moisture the complementarity in the accuracy and spatial coverage between cygnss r ssm and esa cci ssm is shown considering diverse land cover cygnss r ssm obtain higher correlation coefficient than esa cci over grassland savanna shrubland and cropland in barren and forest the correlation coefficient was lower than esa cci in general cygnss r ssm show the potential to capture higher precision and the temporal trends on lightly vegetated areas therefore cygnss has demonstrated the potential to improve the accuracy of fusion products through its high accuracy and ability to capture temporal correlations in general cygnss r based ssm has great application potential in various land cover because of the high spatial temporal revisiting observation of cygnss in the future integration of soil moisture products from different sources can be considered to promote the quality of cygnss r based ssm and obtain soil moisture estimation with higher accuracy and higher spatio temporal resolution credit authorship contribution statement haotian wang

assessed and compared results show that cygnss r based ssm achieve overall higher absolute accuracy than smap satellite based ssm cygnss r based ssm achieved worse accuracy indicators than smap ssm in grassland savanna shrubland cropland and forest land cover and had slightly better accuracy than smap in barren pixels cygnss has demonstrated the potential to improve the accuracy of fusion products through its high accuracy and ability to capture temporal correlations in tc analyses the complementarity in the accuracy and spatial coverage between cygnss r ssm and esa cci ssm is shown considering diverse land cover in general cygnss r ssm shows the potential to capture higher accuracy and temporal trends in lightly vegetated areas the tc based assessments proposed in this study can provide a reference for evaluating the accuracy of soil moisture products and comparing the accuracy of soil moisture from different sources furthermore the error verification results can provide a reference

through the inversion of l band signals from spaceborne global navigation satellite system reflectometry gnss r have attracted increasing attention gnss r operates in a bistatic configuration where the transmitted signal is first scattered forward by the earth s surface and then captured by a receiver not collocated with the transmitter zavorotny et al 2014 gnss r receivers can be low in cost mass and power consumption gnss r based soil moisture products are more affordable taking advantage of several transmitters that are already in orbit as a part of the gnss constellation with a relatively large spatial footprint and frequent observation on the earth s surface gnss r based ssm has the potential for contributing higher spatio temporal resolution to hydrometeorological monitoring and water resources management as an early spaceborne gnss r observatory the techdemosat 1 tds 1 in the united kingdom provided diverse and large observations supporting retrieval however

released cygnss r based soil moisture product worldwide which has been distributed by nasa physical oceanography distributed active archive centers po daac the soil moisture accuracy of cygnss r based ssm should be comprehensively verified with a wide range of possible methods soil moisture accuracy verification is constrained by obtaining reliable estimates of ground truth soil moisture making it difficult to obtain large scale global scale true soil moisture measurements crow et al 2012 although ground based observation sites provide local small scale soil moisture measurements assessments

specifically a new evaluation triplet is cygnss r based merged and in situ tc method cmid tc it is provided to incorporate site observations and evaluate cygnss r based errors on a local scale we also analyze the error indicators to further evaluate the performance of different products over different land cover types based on in situ and tc evaluations from the perspective of temporal variation

specifically the research area is the qg area between 38 n and 38 s and between 135 e and 164 w shown in fig 1 because the coverage of cygnss soil moisture is the qg area in this study the accuracy of cygnss r ssm soil moisture is verified and compared with satellite based soil moisture and merged soil moisture 2 2 gnss r based ssm retrievals from cygnss cygnss level 3 soil moisture version 1 0 is a gnss r based l band bistatic radar dataset released by ucar cu providing daily and sub daily estimates of ssm at a 6 h discretization for most of the subtropics from march 18 2017 to august 16 2020 chew and small 2018 this dataset uses a linear regression model between the smap soil moisture and cygnss reflectivity to solve for daily and sub daily soil moisture retrieved from effective reflectivity calculated from cygnss chew and small 2020 the dataset is gridded to 36 km easev2 grids to be consistent with smap ssm the data are archived and can be freely accessed from https podaac jpl nasa gov owing to the asynchronous nature of the orbits of the gps transmitters and cygnss receivers in the bistatic radar link temporal sampling is best described by a probability distribution of the revisit time at each location within the 38 latitude coverage area the median value of the revisit frequency is 2 h and the mean revisit frequency is 6 h traditional remote sensing observations periodically observe a specific location at a specific time in a day in the form of a push broom cycle with a consistent revisit frequency on the contrary gnss r uses ground reflected signals as observation signals and the specular reflection points on the earth s surface are determined by the positions of the transmitting and receiving satellites the observed footprints formed by gnss r on the surface present a statistical pseudo random distribution and aggregate with the increase of observations to present a complete reflected signal therefore the daily records of gnss r ssm represent the soil moisture average for that day cygnss ssm retrievals are collected from april 1 2017 to march 31 2020 for validation data records at each 6 hours discretization of time were aggregated to a daily average considering that cygnss functions as a constellation of passive sensors that receive the signal of surface reflected gps pulses chew et al 2020 cygnss ssm can be considered as ssm 0 5 cm 2 3 ground based ssm observations from ismn the ground based ssm observations for validation were based on data archived from international soil moisture network ismn dorigo et al 2013 eight soil

further regridded to 36 km easev2 grids to be consistent with cygnss r ssm and smap ssm considering the scale difference between satellite based gnss r retrieval measurements and merged soil moisture

and regridded to 36 km easev2 grids 3 methodology 3 1 spatial temporal resampling for each day starting from the time frame center at 0 00 utc observations within 12 h as the time sampling window are considered first the daily temporal resolution is chosen as the time baseline since the temporal resolution of smap and esa cci ssm products is daily although cygnss r based ssm product provides both 6 hourly and daily temporal resolution products smap and esa cci only have soil moisture products with daily minimum temporal resolution second the reference time for the assessment is set at 0 00 utc to be consistent with the esa cci products which are provided at a temporal resolution of daily centered at 0 00 utc to be specific the ismn in situ daily soil moisture time series are constructed with respect to the 12 h windows centered at 0 00 utc using all hours of data the local equatorial overpass time of smap ssm is converted to utc first then the smap daily composite soil moisture estimates are reconstructed within a 12 h window centered at 0 00 utc using their observations from both the ascending and descending modes cygnss r soil moisture is provided with a 6 hour temporal resolution starting at 0 00 utc for every 6 hour period and also reconstructed within a 12 h window centered at 0 00 utc these sparsely distributed sites have been widely used to validate grid based soil moisture xu 2020 xu et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2022 xu et al 2021a b to mitigate scaling differences between the point based in situ measurements and grid based soil moisture products in situ sites that have standard deviations less than 0 1 with cygnss soil moisture and esa cci soil moisture are removed xu et al 2021a b considering the situation of multiple stations in a sparse grid the station with the highest correlation with the grid based soil moisture in the coarse grid is selected dorigo et al 2017 3 2 triple collocation tc method stoffelen 1998 is an uncertainty estimation method for estimating the random errors of three mutually independent measurement systems the premise of the application of this data set is that the data of the three measurement systems are independent and linearly related to the hypothetical true value moreover the errors of the three measurement systems are independent of each other and the hypothetical true value the linear error model for soil moisture evaluation is presented as follows 1 ϑ i ϑ i ε i α i β i t ε i where ϑ i i 1 2 3 are three sets of juxtaposed independent measurement systems corresponding to gnss r soil moisture satellite remote sensing soil moisture products and in situ soil moisture or fused soil moisture products t is the true soil moisture α i and β i are the additive and multiplicative deviations of the dataset relative to the true soil moisture signal in the ordinary least squares modeling respectively and ε i is the additional zero mean random noise the error estimation equation for calculating the rmse of the three groups of soil moisture by tc is obtained by determining the hypothetical true value 2 σ ε i σ ϑ 1 2 σ ϑ 1 ϑ 2 σ ϑ 1 ϑ 3 σ ϑ 2 ϑ 3 σ ϑ 2 2 σ ϑ

respectively σ ϑ 1 ϑ 2 σ ϑ 1 ϑ 3 and σ ϑ 2 ϑ 3 are the covariance of ϑ 1 and ϑ 2 ϑ 1 and ϑ 3 and ϑ 2 and ϑ 3 respectively the correlation coefficient can be derived from the measurement system with respect to the unknown target by the extended tc approach mccoll et al 2014 the unbiased signal to noise ratio provides a complementary perspective compared with the rmse in addition extended tc method has the ability to provide different perspectives for verification results 3 ρ t ϑ i 2 β t 2 σ ϑ i 2 β t 2 σ ϑ i 2 σ ε i 2 snr ub snr ub 1 4 snr ub var i var ε i β t 2 σ ϑ i 2 σ ε i 2 where ρ t ϑ i 2 is the squared correlation coefficient and snr ub is the unbiased signal to noise ratio 3 3 non tc based evaluation metrics four metrics are introduced to validate the accuracy of cygnss r based ssm and other ssm in this study including pearson correlation coefficient root mean square error rmse unbiased rmse ubrmse and bias pearson correlation coefficient is used to measure the degree of linear correlation between site observations and cyngss r based ssm rmse measures the deviation between cygnss r based ssm and other soil moisture including in situ measurements or ssm from different sources bias represents the systematic deviation between cygnss r based ssm and in situ measurement ubrmse is adopted to evaluate the absolute deviation of cygnss r based and in situ measurement better as the bias of rmse is eliminated these indicators can be calculated as follows 5 r 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x σ x y i y σ y 6 r m s e i 1 n x i y i 2 n 7 b i a s 1 n i 1 n x i y i 8 u b r m s e i 1 n x i x y i y 2 n where x i and y i represent two different types of soil moisture data such as satellite observations and in situ ground truth data n is the total number of observations x and y σ x and σ y represent the mean and standard deviation sd of the data respectively 4 results and discussions 4 1 temporal pattern of soil moisture fig 2 shows the regional average daily ssm over the study period generally the time series fluctuation trends and amplitudes of three soil moisture are relatively similar the estimated values of cygnss ssm and smap ssm are closer since a linear relationship between the smap soil moisture and cygnss reflectivity is used to derive cygnss ssm chew and small 2018 which is different from esa cci ssm being lower than the other two products in north america asia and south america in asia and north america cygnss r based ssm can capture evident seasonal changes in addition the seasonal variabilities in africa and oceania are more volatile whereas the seasonal variabilities trends captured in europe are smaller than the esa cci ssm and in south america seasonal variabilities are gentle 4 2 in situ assessment the results of the validation of the cygnss ssm using in situ sites are given as follows fig 3 shows the box plot of the error validation using site validation for cygnss r based ssm compared with smap ssm with a total of 332 matching valid sites the cross symbol represents the mean value and the line in the boxplot represents the median the correlation of cygnss ssm was lower than that of smap ssm in all regions in asia and africa ubrmse of cygnss ssm was higher than that of smap ssm in north america ubrmse of cygnss ssm was slightly higher than that of smap ssm however better ubrmse was achieved in oceania rmse and bias have a similar distribution fig 4 shows the results of classifying the site verification results of gnss r based ssm according to different land covers overall cygnss r based ssm has better validation accuracy in cropland and bare land but there may be overestimation in forested areas in the gnss r soil moisture open water will have a strong influence on the specular reflection points so the accuracy of the water mask will affect the inversion results optical water masks were used in the cygnss r based ssm inversion algorithm because the optical data properties underestimate the soil moisture under vegetation 4 3 cmid based tc assessment the introduction of merged based ssm into the triplet method can estimate random errors compared with merged soil moisture fig 5 shows the error standard deviation sd statistic of ssm based on etc with a combined cmid based dataset formed from cygnss r based ssm merged ssm and in situ observations the sd of cygnss r ssm was higher than that of esa cci ssm with an average of 0 053 in the qg area with an average sd of 0 069 low error sd statistic is shown in north america for cygnss r ssm and a high error sd statistic for cygnss r ssm is seen in asia africa and oceania the influence of ground noise may introduce errors in some specific regions in cygnss r based ssm in land calibration additional empirical calibration of gps transmit power may cause differences because of error uncertainty ruf et al 2018 2019 fig 6 depicts the correlation coefficient results obtained by applying the etc validation on the combined validation dataset for global and regional cygnss r ssm achieved a relatively higher correlation followed by esa cci ssm 0 62 exhibiting an average correlation of 0 64 in north america and oceania cygnss achieves higher temporal correlations than esa cci the correlation coefficient is generally lower in asia and africa than in esa cci the results of standard deviations and correlation coefficients for different land cover based on the cmid based etc are shown in fig 7 cygnss r ssm demonstrates higher accuracy than esa cci over savanna and shrubland low accuracy is seen in the grassland cropland forest and barren in terms of forests cygnss r ssm underestimates ssm which may be greatly affected by the biased surface temperature and other potential factors fan et al 2020 cygnss r ssm obtains a higher correlation coefficient than esa cci over grassland savanna shrubland and cropland in barren and forest the correlation coefficient was lower than esa cci overall cygnss r ssm shows the potential to capture higher precision and temporal trends in lightly vegetated areas 4 4 comparison of in situ assessment and tc analysis the results of cygnss soil moisture based on site verification are similar to the results of the triple combination the accuracy of cygnss ssm is improved but has a relative loss in correlation at the same time the combination of cygnss esa cci and in situ supplemented the assessment results of cygnss ssm compared with the merged soil moisture source ubrmse is adopted to evaluate the absolute deviation as the bias of rmse is eliminated the triple collocation analysis can get the random error between the statistical dataset and the ideal reality and measure the degree of variation or dispersion of the dataset the results of the in situ assessment are also different from those obtained from the cmid based tc evaluation the accuracy of cygnss is higher than smap in in situ assessment tc analysis showed that cygnss could capture a higher temporal correlation in soil moisture fusion the correlation coefficients obtained by in situ assessment and triple combination are different since there are representative errors between point based observations and grid based retrievals although the sites are sparsely distributed the triple collocation method deflates the accuracy by inexplicitly utilizing an ideal truth reference the in situ assessment results are complementary to the triple combination method in the systematic error estimation at the local scale as it calculates the absolute error of the dataset 5 conclusions in this study cygnss r ssm are validated at a quasi global scale and the accuracy is compared with smap and esa cci ssm based on in situ based validation and tc based evaluation a triplet dataset composed of cygnss r merged and in situ tc method cmid tc is used to validate and evaluate cygnss r based ssm based on tc methods both in situ based validation and tc based evaluation methods are used to analyze the results on different land cover results show that cygnss r based ssm achieve higher absolute accuracy than smap satellite based ssm cygnss r based ssm achieves worse accuracy indicators than smap ssm on grassland savanna shrubland cropland and forest but has slightly better accuracy than smap on barren hence less vegetation cover and surface water are allowed for clearer specular points in the surface fresnel reflection area the evaluation result of the forest type has relatively bad performance because of the complexity of forest tree morphology and accumulation affecting the gnss r signal results from tc analysis show that cygnss r ssm outperforms esa cci ssm in terms of capturing the temporal trends of soil moisture the complementarity in the accuracy and spatial coverage between cygnss r ssm and esa cci ssm is shown considering diverse land cover cygnss r ssm obtain higher correlation coefficient than esa cci over grassland savanna shrubland and cropland in barren and forest the correlation coefficient was lower than esa cci in general cygnss r ssm show the potential to capture higher precision and the temporal trends on lightly vegetated areas therefore cygnss has demonstrated the potential to improve the accuracy of fusion products through its high accuracy and ability to capture temporal correlations in general cygnss r based ssm has great application potential in various land cover because of the high spatial temporal revisiting observation of cygnss in the future integration of soil moisture products from different sources can be considered to promote the quality of cygnss r based ssm and obtain soil moisture estimation with higher accuracy and higher spatio temporal resolution credit authorship contribution statement haotian wang

2742,in sparsely fractured rocks the rock matrix is an important geochemical buffer and provides significant retardation to contaminants advected through the flowing fractures accounting for geochemical reactions and mass exchange between these two regions is key to properly capture the overall buffering capacity and the related hydrogeochemical evolution of a fractured medium reactive transport modelling in these kinds of fractured media is routinely performed using equivalent continuous porous media ecpm models i e continuum models based on permeability and porosity fields that somehow preserve the underlying fracture properties which are in turn described by companion discrete fracture network dfn models however the proper parameterisation of these models in terms of mass exchange between fractures and the bordering matrix is still a largely unresolved issue here we leverage the dual continuum disconnected matrix model dcdmm formulation included in the massively parallel code pflotran to propose a novel parameterisation approach that honours the local volumetric fracture density p 32 the proposed approach is first benchmarked against a semi analytical solution with a problem that entails flow and transport along two different and consecutive fractures two demonstrative large scale reactive transport problems are also presented and discussed the first is related to the generation and migration of radiogenic helium and the second assesses the buffering capacity of a realistic fractured medium against the infiltration of acidic water the latter simulation which includes more than three hundred million transport degrees of freedom is one of the largest subsurface reactive transport models ever formulated and solved this simulation was made possible by the highly efficient implementation of the dcdmm in pflotran which makes the solution of the secondary continuum equations embarrassingly parallel msc 86 08 62p12 keywords reactive transport modelling fractured media dual continuum disconnected matrix model discrete fracture network models data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in crystalline rocks fractures are typically sparse and their size is commonly described by power law relationships selroos et al 2022 and references therein which means that most of these features are in the meter scale while larger fractures 10 m are rare some of these fractures are hydraulically connected and form a network through which dissolved solutes may be transported by advection solutes may also be exchanged with the rock matrix through molecular diffusion neretnieks 1980 wherefore fractured crystalline rocks effectively behaves as a dual porosity system bibby 1981 the rock matrix might play an important role as a buffer against hydro geochemical perturbations e g the infiltration of oxygenated glacial meltwater trinchero et al 2017 and can significantly retard the transport of solutes along flowing fractures e g radionucles trinchero et al 2020a sparsely fractured crystalline rocks are often represented using discrete fracture network dfn models in which groundwater flow and transport are assumed to take place along a connected network of two dimensional geometrical entities dfns are typically based on statistical descriptions of observable distributions such as fracture traces in outcrops or drill cores whereby they may be characterised by a specified fracture intensity dershowitz 1984 each geometrical entity represents a single fracture and is characterised by its own flow hydraulic and transport aperture despite being cornerstones for e g safety assessment studies of nuclear waste repositories in fractured rocks and despite increasingly accessible computational power and efficient computer codes available the deployment of dfn models for regional scale reactive transport modelling is still computationally prohibitive thus reactive transport models are routinely based on equivalent continuous porous media ecpm representations of the fractured system e g wang et al 2022a i e continuum models based on heterogeneous distributions of permeability storativity and porosity that somehow preserve the underlying fracture properties svensson 2001a b though the formulation of ecpm models has been widely assessed e g jackson et al 2000 how to represent mass exchange processes between flowing fractures and the bordering rock matrix in ecpm models is still a largely unresolved issue that requires selecting numerical schemes and appropriate parameterisation strategies an aspect to be taken into account is computational efficiency since depending on the chosen approach the explicit consideration of the rock matrix might increase the total number of transport degrees of freedom by an order of magnitude or more moreover not all the available schemes of mass exchange are suited for the simulation of complex reactive transport phenomena defined by tens of primary and secondary species and by a number of primary and secondary minerals the multi rate mass transfer model haggerty and gorelick 1995 which has been recently generalised to the solution of reactive problems wang et al 2022b is indeed a potentially appealing approach which however requires further testing and development since to date has only been applied to the simulation of simple physical and chemical systems and it has not been coded in parallel reactive transport codes an alternative approach for the modelling of dual porosity systems which was formulated in the context of fluid and heat transport is the so called multiple interacting continua minc method pruess 1985 minc postulates a sugar cube model for a fractured porous reservoir where discontinuous cubic matrix blocks are separated by fractures minc was later implemented in the flow and reactive transport code toughreact xu et al 2006 a very similar conceptual model is used in the so called dual continuum disconnected matrix model dcdmm lichtner 2000 which is the basis for the multiple continuum module implemented into the high performance reactive transport code pflotran hammond and lichtner 2010 lichtner et al 2013b a significant difference between the two implementations is that in toughreact primary and secondary continua are handled as a single system of equations that is solved simultaneously whereas in pflotran the primary and secondary continua are solved separately by considering the secondary continua as a 1d system of equations the latter is a significantly more computationally efficient approach lichtner and karra 2014 iraola et al 2019 in this paper we show that by honouring the local fracture density when parameterising dual continuum models reactive transport can be efficiently simulated in fractured media using the dcdmm computational algorithm we also demonstrate the use of this approach for simulating reactive transport in dfns for large scale applications a test case simulating transport between two consecutive fractures is shown to illustrate the conceptual framework and to verify the numerical implementation two large scale dfn derived ecpm reactive transport models one focused on describing radiogenic helium production and migration and the second related to low ph buffering by calcite dissolution are also presented and discussed to the knowledge of the authors the latter simulation which includes more than three hundred million transport degrees of freedom and was run in the supercomputer jureca for a simulation time frame of 10 000 y is one of the largest subsurface reactive transport models ever formulated and solved at this level of detail 2 mathematical development the modelling framework discussed in this work is related to the multiple continuum module implemented in pflotran lichtner et al 2013a hammond et al 2014 lichtner and karra 2014 in the dual continuum dc approach used in this work the total volume v tot of the fractured system is split into primary continuum volume fracture volume v f and secondary continuum volume v m and the following relationship holds 1 v tot v f v m the equation can be re written in terms of corresponding volume fractions of the two continua 2 1 ϵ f ϵ m where ϵ is the volume fraction and the sub scripts f m are for fracture and matrix continua respectively the representation of reactive chemical species follows the canonical form presented in lichtner et al 1996 if there are n reacting chemical species with n r aqueous reactions and n r eq aqueous equilibrium reactions then the system can be simplified by splitting it into n c n n r eq components or primary species and n r eq remaining secondary species the concentrations of primary species are obtained from mass balance conservation whereas the concentrations of the secondary species are evaluated from the primary species concentrations using law of mass action the total component concentrations which are the conserved quantities are defined as 3 ψ j f m c j i 1 n r eq ν j i eq c i here j indicates the primary species the sum is performed over the n r eq secondary species with stoichiometric coefficients ν j i and c indicating the respective molar concentrations notice that from now on super sub script f m is used to indicate that a quantity operator applies to either the fracture super sub script f or the rock matrix super sub script m the same set of aqueous and mineral reactions are assumed to occur in both primary and secondary continua we refer to lichtner and karra 2014 and iraola et al 2019 for details on how aqueous and mineral reactions are re casted in a canonical form assuming saturated flow conditions the mass balance equations for the two continua take the form 4a t ϵ f φ f ψ j f ω j f ϵ f s 1 n s ν j s i s f ϵ f r n r eq 1 n r ν j r kin i r f s f a f m f f m 4b t φ m ψ j m ξ ω j m s 1 n s ν j s i s m r n r eq 1 n r ν j r kin i r m s m where ψ j f m are the total concentrations of species j and φ f m are the porosities of the two continua s f m are source sink terms and i r f m are the aqueous kinetic reaction rates in the primary and secondary continua the operators ξ are the gradient operators in the primary and secondary continua respectively with ξ representing the secondary continuum space the first term on the right hand side of the two equations includes the n s mineral kinetic reactions and i s f m are the mineral kinetic reaction rates with respective stoichiometric coefficients ν j s which are defined as 5 i s f m k s f m a s f m 1 k s f m q s f m ζ s f m where k s f m a s f m are the kinetic rate constants and specific mineral surface areas in the primary and secondary continua respectively k s f m are the equilibrium constants and q s f m are the ion activity products given as 6 q s f m j a j f m ν j s f m eq 6 is a function of the activities defined as the product of the species concentrations and their corresponding activity coefficients a j γ j a j the equilibrium constant may vary with temperature and can thus in principle be different in the fracture and matrix continua the factors ζ s f m take on the values one or zero depending on whether the mineral is supersaturated or undersaturated and present in the control volume ζ s f m 1 or undersaturated but not present ζ s f m 0 and are calculated as follows 7 ζ s f m 1 k s f m q s f m 1 or ϕ s f m 0 0 otherwise where ϕ s f m are the mineral volume fractions in the primary and secondary continua changes in mineral volume fractions are calculated from the mineral balance equations 8 ϕ s f m t v s i s f m where v s is the mineral molar volume in eq 4a the mass exchange between primary and secondary continuum is given by the term a f m f f m where f f m if the mass flux while a f m is the fracture bulk specific surface area defined as the fracture matrix interfacial area per bulk volume m 1 in fractured media a f m is equal to twice the statistical parameter p 32 dershowitz 1984 the latter is typically used to define fracture density in dfn modelling and is expressed as the fracture surface area per unit volume it should be noticed that a factor of 2 is needed since transport simulations and the related parameters explicitly acknowledge the existence of two surfaces separated by the fracture volume whereas dfn statistics treat fractures as planar entities mass fluxes ω f m are evaluated as 9a ω j f q f ψ j f ϵ f φ f d f ψ j f 9b ω j m φ m d m ξ ψ j m where d f is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor in the fracture d m is the pore diffusion coefficient in the matrix and q f is the water volumetric flux in the fracture calculated using darcy s model 10 q f k f k r μ p f ρ g z where k f is the fracture saturated permeability k r is the relative permeability μ is the viscosity of water p f is the pore pressure of water in the fracture continuum ρ is the water density g is gravitational acceleration and z is the elevation notice that d m in eq 9b accounts for the constrictivity and tortuosity of the rock matrix and thus is typically one to several orders of magnitude lower than molecular diffusion in water the following boundary conditions are set on the secondary continuum 11a ψ j m ξ 0 t x ψ j f x t 11b ξ ψ j m n ξ δ m t x 0 where x is a point in fracture continuum t is time ξ 0 is the interface between fracture and matrix and δ m is the matrix length eq 11a implies continuity at the fracture matrix interface whereas eq 11b assumes that there is symmetry in the fracture matrix system and 2 δ m is typically considered as the fracture spacing appropriate initial conditions for concentrations that need not be identical are prescribed in both continua notice that these initial and boundary conditions are imposed by the dcdmm formulation the primary and secondary continua are linked through the mass exchange flux term 12 f f m x t ω m n ξ 0 t x in pflotran the primary and secondary continuum mass balance partial differential equations in eq 4 are discretised using a two point flux finite volume method in space and using backward euler scheme resulting in a set of equivalent non linear algebraic equations the system of partial differential equations eq 4 implies that the diffusive mass flux exchange term depends only on the given primary continuum grid cell concentration and its corresponding secondary continuum concentration whereas it does not depend on other primary secondary continuum grid cells the dcdmm is particularly efficient since the boundary condition for the governing equation of the secondary continuum is only a function of the concentration at the primary grid cell that it belongs to this implies that the primary and secondary continua are fully implicitly coupled but the secondary continua are only solved in 1d this coupling leads to an embarrassingly parallel system of equations for the secondary continuum concentrations of primary species are obtained by solving for mass conservation for the components eq 4 concentrations of secondary species are then retrieved from the law of mass action for the equilibrium equations 13 k i a i j 1 n c a j ν j i eq 3 parameterisation of dfn based ecpm reactive transport models there are different techniques that can be used to formulate equivalent permeability and porosity values for dfn based ecpm models some of these techniques consist in performing local scale flow and tracer experiments and from those deriving equivalent permeability tensors and porosity values jackson et al 2000 other approaches formulate these properties based on pure geometric considerations svensson 2001a mckenna and reeves 2006 the way how ecpm parameters are defined is not central to this work thus a discussion on pros and cons of these different approaches is out of the scope of this study here we will simply illustrate the derivation of permeability and porosity values in geometric based methods and we use the related equations as the basis for the formulation of a dfn consistent parameterisation of mass exchange processes it is worthwhile noting that the proposed formulation is generic and can be used in any dfn based ecpm model irrespective of the way how ecpm parameters are defined the equivalent permeability of the j th grid block k e q j m 2 is computed as 14 k e q j 2 3 d i 1 n b i 3 where the sum is over the n fracture intersecting the current grid block b i m is the half aperture of the i th fracture and d m is the fracture spacing which is typically set equal to the grid size δ j m divided by n some numerical codes based on the finite volume method compute fracture intersections at cell sides thus allowing for anisotropy to be properly captured in some other formulations anisotropy is explicitly accounted for by means of a full permeability tensor hadgu et al 2017 regardless of the method used to represent permeability kinematic porosity is defined as 15 ϵ f j 2 i 1 n a i j b i v b j where a i j m 2 is the surface area of fracture i that intersects grid cell j and v b m 3 is the bulk volume of the considered grid cell in transport applications 2 a i j is denoted as flow wetted surface area moreno and neretnieks 1993 and is a key parameter controlling mass transfer between the flowing fracture and the bordering rock matrix notice that this definition of ϵ is consistent with that of fracture volume fraction defined in eq 2 the dual continuum framework presented in section 2 is defined by parameters that are a function of the underlying fracture matrix system some of these parameters such as pore diffusivity d m and matrix porosity φ m depend on characteristics of the rock matrix and can be determined in the laboratory by means of e g water saturation method and through diffusion experiments e g trinchero et al 2020b and references therein the other three parameters within the dual continuum framework are dependent on the geometry of the fracture network and the related fracture characteristics namely the fracture volume fraction ϵ f eq 2 the fracture bulk specific surface area a f m eq 4a and the matrix length δ m eq 11b it turns out that a proper parameterisation of a dual continuum ecpm model should be carried out in a way consistent with the underlying dfn model which is what we do next the fracture volume fraction has already been derived in eq 15 whereas the bulk specific fracture surface area is related to the local p 32 16 a f m j 2 i 1 n a i j v b j 2 p 32 to derive a dfn consistent value of matrix thickness we assume that each grid cell of the continuum model is represented as a system of parallel planar fractures this conceptualisation implies that matrix length is the inverse of the fracture specific surface area 17 δ m j 1 ϵ f j a f m j 1 a f m j 1 2 p 32 notice that the matrix length is the distance of any point in the fracture from the no mass flux boundary in the bordering matrix eq 11b for the parallel fractures model used here the matrix length is equal to the fracture half spacing the flowchart of fig 1 shows the different steps along with the companion supporting information required for the implementation and deployment of reactive transport models for the long term analysis of deep geological repositories built in fracture crystalline rock a dfn model is first built upon a fracture recipe that honours the observed fractured statistics obtained from e g outcrop analysis core logging etc step i site specific scaling laws relating e g fracture transmissivity to fracture size are formulated based on the calibration of in situ hydraulic and tracer tests step ii the upscaling of the dfn to ecpm step iii and the parameterisation of the dual continuum model iv are carried out according to the methodology described in this section the last step step v involves setting up the reactive transport model using both information from site characterisation e g fracture filling mineral abundance current groundwater composition and results from companion models e g climate models landscape models etc this flowchart is here showed with illustrative purposes only models are in fact fit for purpose and thus different steps can be followed for their implementation no matter what these steps are if a continuum approach is to be used steps iii and iv are deemed to be generic and thus can be used for any other application at hand 4 model verification the dcdmm included in the standard release version of pflotran has limited flexibility in terms of model parameterisation as fracture matrix parameters are assumed to be constant across the whole model domain therefore the numerical implementation of the proposed conceptual framework sections 2 to 3 has required the development of a customised pflotran version which allows grid cell based values of ϵ f and δ m to be accommodated using external hdf5 files notice that as already discussed a f m j is inversely dependent on matrix thickness in this section the robustness of the conceptual framework as well as the correct implementation of the dcdmm are verified by solving a simplified exercise based on transport along two consecutive fractures results are compared with an independent solution in sparsely fractured media solute transport is typically assumed to occur along a network of inter connected fracture segments where each segment is characterised by its own fracture aperture and groundwater residence time trinchero et al 2020a using this conceptualisation in this verification exercise two consecutive intersecting fracture segments are considered and a hydraulic gradient is applied between the inlet boundary of the upstream fracture uf and the outlet boundary of the downstream fracture df the fracture matrix system is initially tracer free and a dirichlet boundary condition is used to set a constant tracer concentration at the inlet of the uf the considered solute is non sorbing and non decaying the df is characterised by a wider aperture b d f 2 b u f and the two fractures are mapped into an ecpm using eqs 14 and 15 it is assumed that both fractures see the same extent of rock matrix δ m u f δ m d f thus k e q d f 8 k e q u f and ϵ e q d f 2 ϵ e q u f the parameters of the fracture matrix system are summarised in table 1 whereas the corresponding parameters of the ecpm and related boundary conditions are listed in table 2 these continuum based models were built and solved using pflotran the average permeability of the whole system is given by the harmonic mean 18 k 2 k e q u f k e q d f k e q u f k e q d f notice that this average permeability is here only used to compute the average groundwater travel time which is equal to τ 1 76 1 0 2 y the results of the pflotran calculation are here compared to the analytical solution developed by sudicky and frind 1982 sudicky s solution for the sake of brevity sudicky s solution is based on a system of parallel homogeneous fractures however it can be easily extended to account for longitudinal changes in aperture and velocity by using the convolution theorem in laplace space see appendix a for further details the flow related parameters used for sudicky s solution are listed in table 3 the others parameters used for the sudicky s solution are the same as listed in table 1 an additional continuum based pflotran simulation was carried out in which matrix diffusion was not considered in all the models a continuous injection of a conservative tracer is simulated breakthrough curves showing the computed normalised concentration at the fracture outlet c c 0 are shown in fig 2 top from the logarithmic plot of 1 c c 0 fig 2 bottom it can be noticed that all the breakthrough curves display the expected 0 5 late time slope except for the simulation without matrix that has no tail the agreement between the dual continuum ecpm model and the sudicky s solution is very good a small dispersion has been used in the latter table 3 to account for the small numerical dispersion introduced by pflotran this good agreement confirms the correct implementation of the cell based parameterisation of the dual continuum model of pflotran and supports the parameterisation approach proposed in section 3 it is worth noting that except for the simulation without matrix diffusion all the other solutions display the same height of the tail as shown by trinchero et al 2020b the height of the tail depends on the product of a material parameter group see appendix a and eq a 4 and a flow related parameter called transport resistance which is defined as the ratio between the groundwater travel time and the fracture half aperture β τ b cvetkovic et al 1999 all the considered models including the two homogeneous cases have the same material parameter group and also the same transport resistance since the wider aperture of the df compensates its longer groundwater travel time it is also worthwhile noting that late time tails are not affected by matrix limitation this is because the considered time frame 0 1 y is much shorter than the characteristic time needed by tracer front to reach the outer matrix boundary t c δ m 2 d m 3 2 y an additional verification is presented in appendix b where the results computed using the dcdmm are compared with calculations performed using the time domain random walk computer code marfa painter et al 2008 painter and mancillas 2013 trinchero et al 2020a 5 large scale applications here we use the conceptual and numerical framework presented in sections 2 to 3 to show and discuss the results of two large scale applications the scope of these two application cases is illustrative i e we aim here at showing how the proposed parameterisation approach can be employed in large scale modelling the presented numerical framework can be applied to a broad range of problems therefore we have considered here two different scenarios the first application case assesses the production and migration of radiogenic helium the analysis of helium levels is often used for groundwater age dating in the context of safety assessment studies for deep geological repositories of nuclear waste the second application deals with the infiltration of acidic water and is a problem that is often found in the context of acid mine drainage since both applications are based on the same dfn and groundwater flow model the model set up is presented first 5 1 model set up the dfn model used for the two large scale applications is loosely based on a dfn model developed for the laxemar site in sweden vidstrand et al 2010 laxemar was one of the two sites that were thoroughly characterised during the siting process for a deep geological repository for spent nuclear fuel in sweden the second site forsmark was finally chosen as the site for the proposed repository the laxemar site is located on the swedish east coast c 350 km south of stockholm the site is dominated by a geological unit known as the transscandinavian igneous belt tib the bedrock is characterised by intrusive rocks which have been subjected to repeated phases of brittle deformation under varying regional stress regimes involving reactivation along earlier formed structures söderbäck 2008 compared to forsmark the laxemar site is characterised by a higher fracture frequency particularly at repository depth 400 m the reason for using laxemar is that the site was well studied during the siting process and as such the fracture recipe used here was formulated based on a comprehensive characterisation data set thus it is deemed to be representative of a real granitic rock system the groundwater flow model used here should however be considered as synthetic the dfn was generated using the computer code darcytools svensson and follin 2010 svensson and ferry 2014 in darcytools stochastic fractures are generated according to the following equation 19 n i a l d l l r e f a l l r e f a where n is the number of fractures per unit volume i m 3 is the intensity a is the power law exponent and l r e f m is the reference length which is here set to 1 m here fracture orientation follows a fisher distribution characterised by the following parameters 20a λ 1 cos 90 t r cos p l κ 20b λ 2 sin 90 t r cos p l κ 20c λ 3 sin p l κ where t r and p l are the mean trend and mean plunge respectively and κ is the fisher concentration the following power law relationship between fracture transmissivity t f m 2 s and fracture size l m is considered 21 log t f log a t l 100 b t d t u 0 5 0 5 where a t m 2 s is the transmissivity of a fracture of size l 100 m and b t is the power law exponent u is the uniform distribution and d t is a scaling factor the parameters of this model are taken from the shallow part of the hydraulic rock domain hrd of the laxemar model vidstrand et al 2010 and are summarised in tables 4 and 5 the considered model domain is a regular rectangular parallelepiped with the opposite vertices located at 0 0 0 0 128 0 and 1024 0 1024 0 0 0 with coordinates being expressed in meters the dfn was upscaled into a structured grid of size δ x δ y 4 m and δ z 2 m with a total number of 4 194 304 grid cells the geometric upscaling was performed using the method specified in svensson 2001a fig 3 shows the resulting spatial distribution of fracture volume fraction ϵ f and fig 4 shows the distribution of matrix length δ m the model input files generated by darcytools were imported into pflotran using a dedicated interface called idp molinero et al 2015 some of the grid cells of the ecpm are not intersected by any fracture these cells which are denoted here as unfractured domain to distinguish them from the rock matrix that is part of the secondary overlapping continuum are assigned a minimum value of permeability κ 1 0 20 m 2 fracture volume fraction ϵ f 1 0 10 and a maximum matrix length equal to 4 m and are part of the numerical calculations sensitivity analyses carried out by deactivating the grid cells of the unfractured domain have shown that this part of the domain has a negligible effect on reactive transport across the flowing regions the results of these sensitivity simulations are not included here for the sake of brevity constant hydraulic pressure was applied to two narrow regions in the uppermost face of the domain p 0 10 y 0 p i n and p 1014 1024 y 0 p o u t with p i n p o u t 1000 pa the rest of the boundaries were considered as no flow boundaries the secondary overlapping continuum consists of 20 cells per each cell in the primary continuum the synthetic parameters used in this model are summarised in table 6 fractured media are typically investigated by drilling deep boreholes since hydro chemical measurements performed in open boreholes provide limited information for site understanding transmissive sections are typically identified by means of flowmeters and sampling campaigns are subsequently carried out in packed off sections of a few meters length skb 2013 to mimic this situation here four virtual boreholes have been postulated and are denoted according to their spatial location us upstream south un upstream north ds downstream south dn downstream north the locations of the boreholes are shown in fig 3 each grid cell of a given borehole represents a packed off section and simulation results are shown and analysed accordingly cells belonging to the unfractured domain are not included in the analyses 5 2 application 1 helium generation due to uranium and thorium decay fractured crystalline rocks contain a certain amount of uranium and thorium bearing minerals which due to radioactive decay produce naturally occurring radionuclides some of these daughter nuclides are unstable e g radium and radon while some others i e the end member of a decay chain are stable helium 4 is a stable non sorbing and non reactive isotope and is the direct product of alpha decay of the uranium and thorium decay series thus studying the production and migration of helium 4 is of particular interest for applications such as groundwater age dating torgersen 1980 bethke et al 1999 bethke and johnson 2008 trinchero et al 2019a trinchero and iraola 2020 in this application we use the model developed in section 5 1 to simulate the production of helium 4 in the rock matrix its diffusion into the adjacent flowing fractures and its advection driven transport in the simulation besides helium a conservative non sorbing species was also included helium 4 free water was assumed to infiltrate through the inlet boundary to keep track of conservative transport patterns the conservative tracer was added to the infiltrating boundary water overall the simulation consists of 4 194 304 21 2 176 160 768 transport degrees of freedom the calculation was carried out in the supercomputer jureca of the jülich supercomputing centre jülich supercomputing centre 2018 using 680 processor cores for a total of 100 000 years of simulation time a total of approximately 195 000 h of supercomputing allocation time was consumed besides the use of such a large scale supercomputing facility this very large simulation was feasible also thanks to the afore discussed remarkable efficiency of the dcdmm to analyse the effect of matrix diffusion on the transport and retention of the conservative tracer an additional calculation was carried out where the secondary continuum was not included the results of the two calculations are shown in fig 5 in form of snapshots of concentration distribution at time 1000 y and 10 000 y the tracer infiltrates and is primarily transported along transmissive fractures and later reaches less conductive zones of the primary continuum for the simulation without matrix diffusion after 100 y the tracer has reached the outlet boundary and after 1000 y it has reached most of the domain in the model matrix diffusion has a significant effect on the retardation of the tracer penetration and after 10 000 y the solute has reached only few of the cells at the outlet boundary breakthrough curves of helium concentration in four randomly selected packed off sections of the boreholes are shown in fig 6 the four packed off sections show a similar behaviour with helium concentrations increasing until reaching a steady state value the time needed to reach this steady state value is considerably long due to diffusion limitations the plateau value reached by each breakthrough curve is directly proportional to the groundwater travel time from the inlet and inversely proportional to the fracture volume fraction trinchero et al 2019a the dependence with travel time explains why higher concentrations of helium are generally observed for the sections located in the downstream boreholes variability between sections located at the same distance from the inlet boundary are due to the high heterogeneity of the fractured medium which leads to tortuous and complex infiltration pathways fig 7 mimics a typical set of data available from hydrogeochemical investigations of fractured crystalline bedrock for siting of a spent nuclear fuel repository where groundwater samples are taken from hydraulically isolated transmissive sections of available boreholes related hydrogeochemical measurements in this case values of helium concentration computed at time t 1 1 0 5 y can be plotted against the measured values of permeability of the given packed off sections or their depth the results of this study indicate that the two downstream boreholes generally see higher helium concentration values because they are located further away from the inlet boundary the results do not show any clear long range correlation of concentration with permeability or depth this is not surprising since helium concentration measurements are non local they depend on the history of the analysed groundwater sample since it has entered the subsurface trinchero et al 2019a this means that the measured helium concentration not only depends on the local value of permeability but also on its hydraulic connectivity with the inlet boundary helium data show a certain short range correlation with depth this is also not surprising since nearby sections are more likely to be affected by similar infiltration pathways however the significant heterogeneity of the medium is evident from the set of measurements of dn where high concentration values 5 1 0 4 mol l are found at 83 m depth while distinctively lower values 1 6 1 0 4 mol l are found in a nearby section below 91 m depth ds shows an opposite behaviour with very similar concentration values observed along the entire depth which indicates that the entire borehole is affected by similar infiltration patterns 5 3 application 2 buffering of low ph water by calcite dissolution the geochemical processes considered in the second application case are based on the benchmark problem presented in iraola et al 2019 for a single fracture matrix system calcite is assumed to be initially present in the matrix ϕ c a l c m 1 1 0 5 and absent in the fracture ϕ c a l c f 0 and calcite dissolution follows the reaction 22 caco 3 h ca 2 hco 3 with equilibrium constant log k s f log k s m 1 85 the system is fully defined by the three primary species and the mineral phase of eq 22 and secondary species aqueous complexes are not included in the model the calcite kinetic rate was set equal to 1 0 1 0 6 mol m 2 s jordan and rammensee 1998 and a calcite specific surface area of 1 m 2 m 3 was used the system i e both primary and secondary continua is initially filled with a slightly alkaline water ph 8 in equilibrium with calcite resident water in table 7 whereas a slightly acidic and calcite undersaturated water boundary water in table 7 infiltrates through the inlet boundary the model parameterisation e g permeability fracture volume fraction fracture length flow boundary conditions etc is the same as used in application 1 conceptually the infiltration of acidic water from the inlet boundary brings acidity into the system first through the flowing fractures which are represented by the primary continuum acidity later diffuses into the rock matrix due to the existing chemical gradient between resident and boundary water thus matrix diffusion represents a sink term for the acidity in the absence of geochemical reactions this sink term would progressively vanish once the pore water in the matrix is equilibrated with the fracture filling water in practice close to the inlet boundary these coupled diffusive processes lead to calcite under saturation in the rock matrix bordering the fractures where eq 22 proceeds from the left to the right the consumption of acidity maintains the chemical gradient and the related sink term in the primary continuum significant changes in this system are expected to occur only when calcite is progressively depleted the pflotran calculation was carried out in the supercomputer jureca jülich supercomputing centre 2018 of the jülich supercomputing centre and the simulation time frame was 10 000 years the model discretisation is the same as described in section 5 1 and used in application 1 with the difference that here four primary species are included which implies that the simulation involves a total of 352 321 536 transport degrees of freedom the simulation was run using 680 processor cores and a total of 490 000 h of supercomputing time was used snapshots of ph computed at 100 y and 10 000 y are shown in fig 8 for visualisation purposes here only cells with ϵ f 1 0 6 are shown low ph water is only found in close proximity to the inlet boundary and a modest additional penetration is seen from 100 y to 10 000 y which clearly indicates that acidity is strongly buffered by matrix diffusion and the related calcite dissolution processes in the rock matrix a detailed analysis of the chemical profiles in the rock matrix was performed considering a section of borehole b5 fig 3 which is located close to the inlet boundary the considered section is at depth 45 m the profiles of tracer concentration are shown in fig 9 whereas the profiles of calcium bicarbonate ph and calcite consumption are shown in fig 10 for all the considered species and geochemical variables profiles are shown at time 1000 y and 10 000 y from fig 9 it can be seen that at the end of the simulation the rock matrix is close to equilibrium with the inflowing boundary water that contains the tracer this is not surprising since the chosen section is located close to the inlet boundary and the chosen tracer behaves as a non sorbing non decaying species the analysis of the reactive system fig 10 shows that in the considered borehole section after 1000 y calcite is modestly depleted in a narrow fringe close to the fracture matrix interface calcite dissolution leads to an increase of calcium and bicarbonate concentrations that diffuse beyond the reaction front very modest changes in ph are observed as a result of calcite buffering at the end of the simulation 10 000 y calcite is completely depleted in the first few millimeters of the matrix which explains the modest drop in ph calcium and bicarbonate concentrations behind the reaction front the penetration depth of the reaction front at the end of the simulation is very limited and this is related to diffusion limitations which are confirmed by an analysis of the related damköhler number lichtner and kang 2007 23 d a i i k s a s l c 2 ϕ m d m c 0 here the characteristic length has been set approximately equal to penetration depth l c 1 0 1 0 2 m and c 0 is set equal to the calcium concentration in the resident water table 7 these parameters give d a i i 13 8 which further confirms that the reaction front in the rock matrix is diffusion controlled 6 discussion and conclusions we have presented a conceptual framework for the parameterisation of dfn based ecpm reactive transport models of fractured media and discussed its numerical deployment using the existing massively parallel code pflotran the framework is suited for geological media displaying a dual porosity behaviour i e systems where groundwater flow occurs in a sparse network of connected fractures whereas the bordering rock matrix is accessible by dissolved solutes through molecular diffusion only the study leads to the following general conclusions and recommendations 1 evidence from natural analogues studies chapman et al 1991 nordstrom et al 1992 romero et al 1992 cramer and smellie 1994 cera et al 2002 akagawa et al 2006 and from lab and site investigation programmes skb 2010 poteri et al 2017a b has pointed out that in sparsely fractured media the rock matrix plays a key role for the retardation of harmful contaminants such as radionuclides and is also an important geochemical buffer against possible perturbations such as the infiltration of acidic water from the surface 2 continuum based ecpm representations of the fractured media are numerically appealing formulations for reactive transport modelling 3 given 1 and 2 ecpm models must explicitly account for mass exchange between the flowing fractures and the rock matrix as well as for geochemical reactions in both regions 4 given 3 the dual continuum disconnected matrix model dcdmm is an appealing approach for large scale reactive transport modelling in fractured media since the secondary continuum solve is embarrassingly parallel 5 given 3 the parameterisation of the dcdmm needs to be consistent with the underlying statistics of the fractured medium which are typically formalised into a discrete fracture network model this consistency is here ensured by preserving the local fracture volume fraction and fracture bulk specific surface area a verification exercise based on two consecutive fracture segments has been used to check both the conceptual robustness of the parameterisation approach and the proper implementation of the parameterisation strategy in the chosen numerical code demonstrative simulations carried out using pflotran in the super computer jureca have shown the suitability of the proposed approach for large scale reactive transport modelling in sparsely fractured rocks a simplification of the presented large scale models is that both geochemical reactions and transport properties are assumed to be constant through the entire rock matrix in real fractured systems the matrix bordering a flowing fracture might have experienced significant alteration and this might have enhanced or decreased diffusive mass exchanges e g wogelius et al 2020 moreover geochemical reactions depend on the availability of relevant minerals which might be sparsely available across the rock matrix trinchero et al 2019b in summary both matrix and fracture internal heterogeneity might have an impact on the hydrogeochemical evolution of a fractured system this impact should be addressed quantitatively using fit for purpose numerical models which might in principle be based on the dcdmm formulation presented here credit

sudicky and frind 1982 developed an analytical solution for the problem of transient contaminant transport in a system of perfectly parallel fractures the solution assumes that a constant concentration c 0 is prescribed at the inlet of the flowing fracture dirichlet boundary condition and describes the evolution of resident concentration at any monitoring point of the fracture although the solution is provided in geometric ordinary space it is much more convenient to use here the solution as derived in laplace space thus considering a non decaying non sorbing solute the solution reads a 1 c c 0 s exp ω exp γ where c is the laplace transform of the resident concentration at the monitoring point the first term on the right hand side of eq a 5 represents the laplace transform of the dirichlet boundary condition and s is the laplace variable the arguments of the two exponential functions are a 2 ω τ 2 α d m v and a 3 γ ω 1 4 d m α v v 2 s κ b tanh s d p δ s 1 2 where τ y is the groundwater travel time from the inlet to the monitoring point in the fracture v m y is the groundwater velocity α m is the longitudinal dispersivity d m m 2 y is the molecular diffusion coefficient in pure water δ m is the matrix length and κ is a material parameter group defined as a 4 κ φ d p where φ is the matrix porosity and d p m 2 y is the pore diffusion coefficient in matrix for n consecutive fractures the breakthrough curve at the end of the n th fracture can be computed as a 5 c c 0 s exp ω 1 exp γ 1 exp ω n exp γ n the numerical inversion of the laplace solution is here carried out using the de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 hollenbeck 1998 appendix b verification of the two fractures model against marfa the results of the pflotran calculation for the two fractures model section 4 are here compared to a simulation carried out using the time domain random walk computer code marfa the comparison was made in terms of mass flux ω mol y through the df outlet normalised by mass flux at late times ω lim t ω t for the pflotran model mass fluxes where computed using eq 9a in marfa transport along a fracture is described by two hydrodynamic parameters the groundwater travel time and the transport resistance the latter is defined as cvetkovic et al 1999 b 1 β τ 0 τ d θ b θ where b is the fracture half aperture and θ is a dummy integration variable neglecting fracture internal variability in openings the transport resistance reduces to β τ b the groundwater travel times of the two fracture segments as well as the longitudinal dispersivity used in the marfa simulation are listed in table 3 whereas the transport resistance was set equal to 3 72 y m for both segments notice that β u f β d f since the wider aperture of the df compensates its longer groundwater travel time the results of the comparison exercise are shown in fig b 11 the results of the dual continuum ecpm model and the time domain random walk simulation agree well this provides a further verification of the dcdmm model 
2742,in sparsely fractured rocks the rock matrix is an important geochemical buffer and provides significant retardation to contaminants advected through the flowing fractures accounting for geochemical reactions and mass exchange between these two regions is key to properly capture the overall buffering capacity and the related hydrogeochemical evolution of a fractured medium reactive transport modelling in these kinds of fractured media is routinely performed using equivalent continuous porous media ecpm models i e continuum models based on permeability and porosity fields that somehow preserve the underlying fracture properties which are in turn described by companion discrete fracture network dfn models however the proper parameterisation of these models in terms of mass exchange between fractures and the bordering matrix is still a largely unresolved issue here we leverage the dual continuum disconnected matrix model dcdmm formulation included in the massively parallel code pflotran to propose a novel parameterisation approach that honours the local volumetric fracture density p 32 the proposed approach is first benchmarked against a semi analytical solution with a problem that entails flow and transport along two different and consecutive fractures two demonstrative large scale reactive transport problems are also presented and discussed the first is related to the generation and migration of radiogenic helium and the second assesses the buffering capacity of a realistic fractured medium against the infiltration of acidic water the latter simulation which includes more than three hundred million transport degrees of freedom is one of the largest subsurface reactive transport models ever formulated and solved this simulation was made possible by the highly efficient implementation of the dcdmm in pflotran which makes the solution of the secondary continuum equations embarrassingly parallel msc 86 08 62p12 keywords reactive transport modelling fractured media dual continuum disconnected matrix model discrete fracture network models data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in crystalline rocks fractures are typically sparse and their size is commonly described by power law relationships selroos et al 2022 and references therein which means that most of these features are in the meter scale while larger fractures 10 m are rare some of these fractures are hydraulically connected and form a network through which dissolved solutes may be transported by advection solutes may also be exchanged with the rock matrix through molecular diffusion neretnieks 1980 wherefore fractured crystalline rocks effectively behaves as a dual porosity system bibby 1981 the rock matrix might play an important role as a buffer against hydro geochemical perturbations e g the infiltration of oxygenated glacial meltwater trinchero et al 2017 and can significantly retard the transport of solutes along flowing fractures e g radionucles trinchero et al 2020a sparsely fractured crystalline rocks are often represented using discrete fracture network dfn models in which groundwater flow and transport are assumed to take place along a connected network of two dimensional geometrical entities dfns are typically based on statistical descriptions of observable distributions such as fracture traces in outcrops or drill cores whereby they may be characterised by a specified fracture intensity dershowitz 1984 each geometrical entity represents a single fracture and is characterised by its own flow hydraulic and transport aperture despite being cornerstones for e g safety assessment studies of nuclear waste repositories in fractured rocks and despite increasingly accessible computational power and efficient computer codes available the deployment of dfn models for regional scale reactive transport modelling is still computationally prohibitive thus reactive transport models are routinely based on equivalent continuous porous media ecpm representations of the fractured system e g wang et al 2022a i e continuum models based on heterogeneous distributions of permeability storativity and porosity that somehow preserve the underlying fracture properties svensson 2001a b though the formulation of ecpm models has been widely assessed e g jackson et al 2000 how to represent mass exchange processes between flowing fractures and the bordering rock matrix in ecpm models is still a largely unresolved issue that requires selecting numerical schemes and appropriate parameterisation strategies an aspect to be taken into account is computational efficiency since depending on the chosen approach the explicit consideration of the rock matrix might increase the total number of transport degrees of freedom by an order of magnitude or more moreover not all the available schemes of mass exchange are suited for the simulation of complex reactive transport phenomena defined by tens of primary and secondary species and by a number of primary and secondary minerals the multi rate mass transfer model haggerty and gorelick 1995 which has been recently generalised to the solution of reactive problems wang et al 2022b is indeed a potentially appealing approach which however requires further testing and development since to date has only been applied to the simulation of simple physical and chemical systems and it has not been coded in parallel reactive transport codes an alternative approach for the modelling of dual porosity systems which was formulated in the context of fluid and heat transport is the so called multiple interacting continua minc method pruess 1985 minc postulates a sugar cube model for a fractured porous reservoir where discontinuous cubic matrix blocks are separated by fractures minc was later implemented in the flow and reactive transport code toughreact xu et al 2006 a very similar conceptual model is used in the so called dual continuum disconnected matrix model dcdmm lichtner 2000 which is the basis for the multiple continuum module implemented into the high performance reactive transport code pflotran hammond and lichtner 2010 lichtner et al 2013b a significant difference between the two implementations is that in toughreact primary and secondary continua are handled as a single system of equations that is solved simultaneously whereas in pflotran the primary and secondary continua are solved separately by considering the secondary continua as a 1d system of equations the latter is a significantly more computationally efficient approach lichtner and karra 2014 iraola et al 2019 in this paper we show that by honouring the local fracture density when parameterising dual continuum models reactive transport can be efficiently simulated in fractured media using the dcdmm computational algorithm we also demonstrate the use of this approach for simulating reactive transport in dfns for large scale applications a test case simulating transport between two consecutive fractures is shown to illustrate the conceptual framework and to verify the numerical implementation two large scale dfn derived ecpm reactive transport models one focused on describing radiogenic helium production and migration and the second related to low ph buffering by calcite dissolution are also presented and discussed to the knowledge of the authors the latter simulation which includes more than three hundred million transport degrees of freedom and was run in the supercomputer jureca for a simulation time frame of 10 000 y is one of the largest subsurface reactive transport models ever formulated and solved at this level of detail 2 mathematical development the modelling framework discussed in this work is related to the multiple continuum module implemented in pflotran lichtner et al 2013a hammond et al 2014 lichtner and karra 2014 in the dual continuum dc approach used in this work the total volume v tot of the fractured system is split into primary continuum volume fracture volume v f and secondary continuum volume v m and the following relationship holds 1 v tot v f v m the equation can be re written in terms of corresponding volume fractions of the two continua 2 1 ϵ f ϵ m where ϵ is the volume fraction and the sub scripts f m are for fracture and matrix continua respectively the representation of reactive chemical species follows the canonical form presented in lichtner et al 1996 if there are n reacting chemical species with n r aqueous reactions and n r eq aqueous equilibrium reactions then the system can be simplified by splitting it into n c n n r eq components or primary species and n r eq remaining secondary species the concentrations of primary species are obtained from mass balance conservation whereas the concentrations of the secondary species are evaluated from the primary species concentrations using law of mass action the total component concentrations which are the conserved quantities are defined as 3 ψ j f m c j i 1 n r eq ν j i eq c i here j indicates the primary species the sum is performed over the n r eq secondary species with stoichiometric coefficients ν j i and c indicating the respective molar concentrations notice that from now on super sub script f m is used to indicate that a quantity operator applies to either the fracture super sub script f or the rock matrix super sub script m the same set of aqueous and mineral reactions are assumed to occur in both primary and secondary continua we refer to lichtner and karra 2014 and iraola et al 2019 for details on how aqueous and mineral reactions are re casted in a canonical form assuming saturated flow conditions the mass balance equations for the two continua take the form 4a t ϵ f φ f ψ j f ω j f ϵ f s 1 n s ν j s i s f ϵ f r n r eq 1 n r ν j r kin i r f s f a f m f f m 4b t φ m ψ j m ξ ω j m s 1 n s ν j s i s m r n r eq 1 n r ν j r kin i r m s m where ψ j f m are the total concentrations of species j and φ f m are the porosities of the two continua s f m are source sink terms and i r f m are the aqueous kinetic reaction rates in the primary and secondary continua the operators ξ are the gradient operators in the primary and secondary continua respectively with ξ representing the secondary continuum space the first term on the right hand side of the two equations includes the n s mineral kinetic reactions and i s f m are the mineral kinetic reaction rates with respective stoichiometric coefficients ν j s which are defined as 5 i s f m k s f m a s f m 1 k s f m q s f m ζ s f m where k s f m a s f m are the kinetic rate constants and specific mineral surface areas in the primary and secondary continua respectively k s f m are the equilibrium constants and q s f m are the ion activity products given as 6 q s f m j a j f m ν j s f m eq 6 is a function of the activities defined as the product of the species concentrations and their corresponding activity coefficients a j γ j a j the equilibrium constant may vary with temperature and can thus in principle be different in the fracture and matrix continua the factors ζ s f m take on the values one or zero depending on whether the mineral is supersaturated or undersaturated and present in the control volume ζ s f m 1 or undersaturated but not present ζ s f m 0 and are calculated as follows 7 ζ s f m 1 k s f m q s f m 1 or ϕ s f m 0 0 otherwise where ϕ s f m are the mineral volume fractions in the primary and secondary continua changes in mineral volume fractions are calculated from the mineral balance equations 8 ϕ s f m t v s i s f m where v s is the mineral molar volume in eq 4a the mass exchange between primary and secondary continuum is given by the term a f m f f m where f f m if the mass flux while a f m is the fracture bulk specific surface area defined as the fracture matrix interfacial area per bulk volume m 1 in fractured media a f m is equal to twice the statistical parameter p 32 dershowitz 1984 the latter is typically used to define fracture density in dfn modelling and is expressed as the fracture surface area per unit volume it should be noticed that a factor of 2 is needed since transport simulations and the related parameters explicitly acknowledge the existence of two surfaces separated by the fracture volume whereas dfn statistics treat fractures as planar entities mass fluxes ω f m are evaluated as 9a ω j f q f ψ j f ϵ f φ f d f ψ j f 9b ω j m φ m d m ξ ψ j m where d f is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor in the fracture d m is the pore diffusion coefficient in the matrix and q f is the water volumetric flux in the fracture calculated using darcy s model 10 q f k f k r μ p f ρ g z where k f is the fracture saturated permeability k r is the relative permeability μ is the viscosity of water p f is the pore pressure of water in the fracture continuum ρ is the water density g is gravitational acceleration and z is the elevation notice that d m in eq 9b accounts for the constrictivity and tortuosity of the rock matrix and thus is typically one to several orders of magnitude lower than molecular diffusion in water the following boundary conditions are set on the secondary continuum 11a ψ j m ξ 0 t x ψ j f x t 11b ξ ψ j m n ξ δ m t x 0 where x is a point in fracture continuum t is time ξ 0 is the interface between fracture and matrix and δ m is the matrix length eq 11a implies continuity at the fracture matrix interface whereas eq 11b assumes that there is symmetry in the fracture matrix system and 2 δ m is typically considered as the fracture spacing appropriate initial conditions for concentrations that need not be identical are prescribed in both continua notice that these initial and boundary conditions are imposed by the dcdmm formulation the primary and secondary continua are linked through the mass exchange flux term 12 f f m x t ω m n ξ 0 t x in pflotran the primary and secondary continuum mass balance partial differential equations in eq 4 are discretised using a two point flux finite volume method in space and using backward euler scheme resulting in a set of equivalent non linear algebraic equations the system of partial differential equations eq 4 implies that the diffusive mass flux exchange term depends only on the given primary continuum grid cell concentration and its corresponding secondary continuum concentration whereas it does not depend on other primary secondary continuum grid cells the dcdmm is particularly efficient since the boundary condition for the governing equation of the secondary continuum is only a function of the concentration at the primary grid cell that it belongs to this implies that the primary and secondary continua are fully implicitly coupled but the secondary continua are only solved in 1d this coupling leads to an embarrassingly parallel system of equations for the secondary continuum concentrations of primary species are obtained by solving for mass conservation for the components eq 4 concentrations of secondary species are then retrieved from the law of mass action for the equilibrium equations 13 k i a i j 1 n c a j ν j i eq 3 parameterisation of dfn based ecpm reactive transport models there are different techniques that can be used to formulate equivalent permeability and porosity values for dfn based ecpm models some of these techniques consist in performing local scale flow and tracer experiments and from those deriving equivalent permeability tensors and porosity values jackson et al 2000 other approaches formulate these properties based on pure geometric considerations svensson 2001a mckenna and reeves 2006 the way how ecpm parameters are defined is not central to this work thus a discussion on pros and cons of these different approaches is out of the scope of this study here we will simply illustrate the derivation of permeability and porosity values in geometric based methods and we use the related equations as the basis for the formulation of a dfn consistent parameterisation of mass exchange processes it is worthwhile noting that the proposed formulation is generic and can be used in any dfn based ecpm model irrespective of the way how ecpm parameters are defined the equivalent permeability of the j th grid block k e q j m 2 is computed as 14 k e q j 2 3 d i 1 n b i 3 where the sum is over the n fracture intersecting the current grid block b i m is the half aperture of the i th fracture and d m is the fracture spacing which is typically set equal to the grid size δ j m divided by n some numerical codes based on the finite volume method compute fracture intersections at cell sides thus allowing for anisotropy to be properly captured in some other formulations anisotropy is explicitly accounted for by means of a full permeability tensor hadgu et al 2017 regardless of the method used to represent permeability kinematic porosity is defined as 15 ϵ f j 2 i 1 n a i j b i v b j where a i j m 2 is the surface area of fracture i that intersects grid cell j and v b m 3 is the bulk volume of the considered grid cell in transport applications 2 a i j is denoted as flow wetted surface area moreno and neretnieks 1993 and is a key parameter controlling mass transfer between the flowing fracture and the bordering rock matrix notice that this definition of ϵ is consistent with that of fracture volume fraction defined in eq 2 the dual continuum framework presented in section 2 is defined by parameters that are a function of the underlying fracture matrix system some of these parameters such as pore diffusivity d m and matrix porosity φ m depend on characteristics of the rock matrix and can be determined in the laboratory by means of e g water saturation method and through diffusion experiments e g trinchero et al 2020b and references therein the other three parameters within the dual continuum framework are dependent on the geometry of the fracture network and the related fracture characteristics namely the fracture volume fraction ϵ f eq 2 the fracture bulk specific surface area a f m eq 4a and the matrix length δ m eq 11b it turns out that a proper parameterisation of a dual continuum ecpm model should be carried out in a way consistent with the underlying dfn model which is what we do next the fracture volume fraction has already been derived in eq 15 whereas the bulk specific fracture surface area is related to the local p 32 16 a f m j 2 i 1 n a i j v b j 2 p 32 to derive a dfn consistent value of matrix thickness we assume that each grid cell of the continuum model is represented as a system of parallel planar fractures this conceptualisation implies that matrix length is the inverse of the fracture specific surface area 17 δ m j 1 ϵ f j a f m j 1 a f m j 1 2 p 32 notice that the matrix length is the distance of any point in the fracture from the no mass flux boundary in the bordering matrix eq 11b for the parallel fractures model used here the matrix length is equal to the fracture half spacing the flowchart of fig 1 shows the different steps along with the companion supporting information required for the implementation and deployment of reactive transport models for the long term analysis of deep geological repositories built in fracture crystalline rock a dfn model is first built upon a fracture recipe that honours the observed fractured statistics obtained from e g outcrop analysis core logging etc step i site specific scaling laws relating e g fracture transmissivity to fracture size are formulated based on the calibration of in situ hydraulic and tracer tests step ii the upscaling of the dfn to ecpm step iii and the parameterisation of the dual continuum model iv are carried out according to the methodology described in this section the last step step v involves setting up the reactive transport model using both information from site characterisation e g fracture filling mineral abundance current groundwater composition and results from companion models e g climate models landscape models etc this flowchart is here showed with illustrative purposes only models are in fact fit for purpose and thus different steps can be followed for their implementation no matter what these steps are if a continuum approach is to be used steps iii and iv are deemed to be generic and thus can be used for any other application at hand 4 model verification the dcdmm included in the standard release version of pflotran has limited flexibility in terms of model parameterisation as fracture matrix parameters are assumed to be constant across the whole model domain therefore the numerical implementation of the proposed conceptual framework sections 2 to 3 has required the development of a customised pflotran version which allows grid cell based values of ϵ f and δ m to be accommodated using external hdf5 files notice that as already discussed a f m j is inversely dependent on matrix thickness in this section the robustness of the conceptual framework as well as the correct implementation of the dcdmm are verified by solving a simplified exercise based on transport along two consecutive fractures results are compared with an independent solution in sparsely fractured media solute transport is typically assumed to occur along a network of inter connected fracture segments where each segment is characterised by its own fracture aperture and groundwater residence time trinchero et al 2020a using this conceptualisation in this verification exercise two consecutive intersecting fracture segments are considered and a hydraulic gradient is applied between the inlet boundary of the upstream fracture uf and the outlet boundary of the downstream fracture df the fracture matrix system is initially tracer free and a dirichlet boundary condition is used to set a constant tracer concentration at the inlet of the uf the considered solute is non sorbing and non decaying the df is characterised by a wider aperture b d f 2 b u f and the two fractures are mapped into an ecpm using eqs 14 and 15 it is assumed that both fractures see the same extent of rock matrix δ m u f δ m d f thus k e q d f 8 k e q u f and ϵ e q d f 2 ϵ e q u f the parameters of the fracture matrix system are summarised in table 1 whereas the corresponding parameters of the ecpm and related boundary conditions are listed in table 2 these continuum based models were built and solved using pflotran the average permeability of the whole system is given by the harmonic mean 18 k 2 k e q u f k e q d f k e q u f k e q d f notice that this average permeability is here only used to compute the average groundwater travel time which is equal to τ 1 76 1 0 2 y the results of the pflotran calculation are here compared to the analytical solution developed by sudicky and frind 1982 sudicky s solution for the sake of brevity sudicky s solution is based on a system of parallel homogeneous fractures however it can be easily extended to account for longitudinal changes in aperture and velocity by using the convolution theorem in laplace space see appendix a for further details the flow related parameters used for sudicky s solution are listed in table 3 the others parameters used for the sudicky s solution are the same as listed in table 1 an additional continuum based pflotran simulation was carried out in which matrix diffusion was not considered in all the models a continuous injection of a conservative tracer is simulated breakthrough curves showing the computed normalised concentration at the fracture outlet c c 0 are shown in fig 2 top from the logarithmic plot of 1 c c 0 fig 2 bottom it can be noticed that all the breakthrough curves display the expected 0 5 late time slope except for the simulation without matrix that has no tail the agreement between the dual continuum ecpm model and the sudicky s solution is very good a small dispersion has been used in the latter table 3 to account for the small numerical dispersion introduced by pflotran this good agreement confirms the correct implementation of the cell based parameterisation of the dual continuum model of pflotran and supports the parameterisation approach proposed in section 3 it is worth noting that except for the simulation without matrix diffusion all the other solutions display the same height of the tail as shown by trinchero et al 2020b the height of the tail depends on the product of a material parameter group see appendix a and eq a 4 and a flow related parameter called transport resistance which is defined as the ratio between the groundwater travel time and the fracture half aperture β τ b cvetkovic et al 1999 all the considered models including the two homogeneous cases have the same material parameter group and also the same transport resistance since the wider aperture of the df compensates its longer groundwater travel time it is also worthwhile noting that late time tails are not affected by matrix limitation this is because the considered time frame 0 1 y is much shorter than the characteristic time needed by tracer front to reach the outer matrix boundary t c δ m 2 d m 3 2 y an additional verification is presented in appendix b where the results computed using the dcdmm are compared with calculations performed using the time domain random walk computer code marfa painter et al 2008 painter and mancillas 2013 trinchero et al 2020a 5 large scale applications here we use the conceptual and numerical framework presented in sections 2 to 3 to show and discuss the results of two large scale applications the scope of these two application cases is illustrative i e we aim here at showing how the proposed parameterisation approach can be employed in large scale modelling the presented numerical framework can be applied to a broad range of problems therefore we have considered here two different scenarios the first application case assesses the production and migration of radiogenic helium the analysis of helium levels is often used for groundwater age dating in the context of safety assessment studies for deep geological repositories of nuclear waste the second application deals with the infiltration of acidic water and is a problem that is often found in the context of acid mine drainage since both applications are based on the same dfn and groundwater flow model the model set up is presented first 5 1 model set up the dfn model used for the two large scale applications is loosely based on a dfn model developed for the laxemar site in sweden vidstrand et al 2010 laxemar was one of the two sites that were thoroughly characterised during the siting process for a deep geological repository for spent nuclear fuel in sweden the second site forsmark was finally chosen as the site for the proposed repository the laxemar site is located on the swedish east coast c 350 km south of stockholm the site is dominated by a geological unit known as the transscandinavian igneous belt tib the bedrock is characterised by intrusive rocks which have been subjected to repeated phases of brittle deformation under varying regional stress regimes involving reactivation along earlier formed structures söderbäck 2008 compared to forsmark the laxemar site is characterised by a higher fracture frequency particularly at repository depth 400 m the reason for using laxemar is that the site was well studied during the siting process and as such the fracture recipe used here was formulated based on a comprehensive characterisation data set thus it is deemed to be representative of a real granitic rock system the groundwater flow model used here should however be considered as synthetic the dfn was generated using the computer code darcytools svensson and follin 2010 svensson and ferry 2014 in darcytools stochastic fractures are generated according to the following equation 19 n i a l d l l r e f a l l r e f a where n is the number of fractures per unit volume i m 3 is the intensity a is the power law exponent and l r e f m is the reference length which is here set to 1 m here fracture orientation follows a fisher distribution characterised by the following parameters 20a λ 1 cos 90 t r cos p l κ 20b λ 2 sin 90 t r cos p l κ 20c λ 3 sin p l κ where t r and p l are the mean trend and mean plunge respectively and κ is the fisher concentration the following power law relationship between fracture transmissivity t f m 2 s and fracture size l m is considered 21 log t f log a t l 100 b t d t u 0 5 0 5 where a t m 2 s is the transmissivity of a fracture of size l 100 m and b t is the power law exponent u is the uniform distribution and d t is a scaling factor the parameters of this model are taken from the shallow part of the hydraulic rock domain hrd of the laxemar model vidstrand et al 2010 and are summarised in tables 4 and 5 the considered model domain is a regular rectangular parallelepiped with the opposite vertices located at 0 0 0 0 128 0 and 1024 0 1024 0 0 0 with coordinates being expressed in meters the dfn was upscaled into a structured grid of size δ x δ y 4 m and δ z 2 m with a total number of 4 194 304 grid cells the geometric upscaling was performed using the method specified in svensson 2001a fig 3 shows the resulting spatial distribution of fracture volume fraction ϵ f and fig 4 shows the distribution of matrix length δ m the model input files generated by darcytools were imported into pflotran using a dedicated interface called idp molinero et al 2015 some of the grid cells of the ecpm are not intersected by any fracture these cells which are denoted here as unfractured domain to distinguish them from the rock matrix that is part of the secondary overlapping continuum are assigned a minimum value of permeability κ 1 0 20 m 2 fracture volume fraction ϵ f 1 0 10 and a maximum matrix length equal to 4 m and are part of the numerical calculations sensitivity analyses carried out by deactivating the grid cells of the unfractured domain have shown that this part of the domain has a negligible effect on reactive transport across the flowing regions the results of these sensitivity simulations are not included here for the sake of brevity constant hydraulic pressure was applied to two narrow regions in the uppermost face of the domain p 0 10 y 0 p i n and p 1014 1024 y 0 p o u t with p i n p o u t 1000 pa the rest of the boundaries were considered as no flow boundaries the secondary overlapping continuum consists of 20 cells per each cell in the primary continuum the synthetic parameters used in this model are summarised in table 6 fractured media are typically investigated by drilling deep boreholes since hydro chemical measurements performed in open boreholes provide limited information for site understanding transmissive sections are typically identified by means of flowmeters and sampling campaigns are subsequently carried out in packed off sections of a few meters length skb 2013 to mimic this situation here four virtual boreholes have been postulated and are denoted according to their spatial location us upstream south un upstream north ds downstream south dn downstream north the locations of the boreholes are shown in fig 3 each grid cell of a given borehole represents a packed off section and simulation results are shown and analysed accordingly cells belonging to the unfractured domain are not included in the analyses 5 2 application 1 helium generation due to uranium and thorium decay fractured crystalline rocks contain a certain amount of uranium and thorium bearing minerals which due to radioactive decay produce naturally occurring radionuclides some of these daughter nuclides are unstable e g radium and radon while some others i e the end member of a decay chain are stable helium 4 is a stable non sorbing and non reactive isotope and is the direct product of alpha decay of the uranium and thorium decay series thus studying the production and migration of helium 4 is of particular interest for applications such as groundwater age dating torgersen 1980 bethke et al 1999 bethke and johnson 2008 trinchero et al 2019a trinchero and iraola 2020 in this application we use the model developed in section 5 1 to simulate the production of helium 4 in the rock matrix its diffusion into the adjacent flowing fractures and its advection driven transport in the simulation besides helium a conservative non sorbing species was also included helium 4 free water was assumed to infiltrate through the inlet boundary to keep track of conservative transport patterns the conservative tracer was added to the infiltrating boundary water overall the simulation consists of 4 194 304 21 2 176 160 768 transport degrees of freedom the calculation was carried out in the supercomputer jureca of the jülich supercomputing centre jülich supercomputing centre 2018 using 680 processor cores for a total of 100 000 years of simulation time a total of approximately 195 000 h of supercomputing allocation time was consumed besides the use of such a large scale supercomputing facility this very large simulation was feasible also thanks to the afore discussed remarkable efficiency of the dcdmm to analyse the effect of matrix diffusion on the transport and retention of the conservative tracer an additional calculation was carried out where the secondary continuum was not included the results of the two calculations are shown in fig 5 in form of snapshots of concentration distribution at time 1000 y and 10 000 y the tracer infiltrates and is primarily transported along transmissive fractures and later reaches less conductive zones of the primary continuum for the simulation without matrix diffusion after 100 y the tracer has reached the outlet boundary and after 1000 y it has reached most of the domain in the model matrix diffusion has a significant effect on the retardation of the tracer penetration and after 10 000 y the solute has reached only few of the cells at the outlet boundary breakthrough curves of helium concentration in four randomly selected packed off sections of the boreholes are shown in fig 6 the four packed off sections show a similar behaviour with helium concentrations increasing until reaching a steady state value the time needed to reach this steady state value is considerably long due to diffusion limitations the plateau value reached by each breakthrough curve is directly proportional to the groundwater travel time from the inlet and inversely proportional to the fracture volume fraction trinchero et al 2019a the dependence with travel time explains why higher concentrations of helium are generally observed for the sections located in the downstream boreholes variability between sections located at the same distance from the inlet boundary are due to the high heterogeneity of the fractured medium which leads to tortuous and complex infiltration pathways fig 7 mimics a typical set of data available from hydrogeochemical investigations of fractured crystalline bedrock for siting of a spent nuclear fuel repository where groundwater samples are taken from hydraulically isolated transmissive sections of available boreholes related hydrogeochemical measurements in this case values of helium concentration computed at time t 1 1 0 5 y can be plotted against the measured values of permeability of the given packed off sections or their depth the results of this study indicate that the two downstream boreholes generally see higher helium concentration values because they are located further away from the inlet boundary the results do not show any clear long range correlation of concentration with permeability or depth this is not surprising since helium concentration measurements are non local they depend on the history of the analysed groundwater sample since it has entered the subsurface trinchero et al 2019a this means that the measured helium concentration not only depends on the local value of permeability but also on its hydraulic connectivity with the inlet boundary helium data show a certain short range correlation with depth this is also not surprising since nearby sections are more likely to be affected by similar infiltration pathways however the significant heterogeneity of the medium is evident from the set of measurements of dn where high concentration values 5 1 0 4 mol l are found at 83 m depth while distinctively lower values 1 6 1 0 4 mol l are found in a nearby section below 91 m depth ds shows an opposite behaviour with very similar concentration values observed along the entire depth which indicates that the entire borehole is affected by similar infiltration patterns 5 3 application 2 buffering of low ph water by calcite dissolution the geochemical processes considered in the second application case are based on the benchmark problem presented in iraola et al 2019 for a single fracture matrix system calcite is assumed to be initially present in the matrix ϕ c a l c m 1 1 0 5 and absent in the fracture ϕ c a l c f 0 and calcite dissolution follows the reaction 22 caco 3 h ca 2 hco 3 with equilibrium constant log k s f log k s m 1 85 the system is fully defined by the three primary species and the mineral phase of eq 22 and secondary species aqueous complexes are not included in the model the calcite kinetic rate was set equal to 1 0 1 0 6 mol m 2 s jordan and rammensee 1998 and a calcite specific surface area of 1 m 2 m 3 was used the system i e both primary and secondary continua is initially filled with a slightly alkaline water ph 8 in equilibrium with calcite resident water in table 7 whereas a slightly acidic and calcite undersaturated water boundary water in table 7 infiltrates through the inlet boundary the model parameterisation e g permeability fracture volume fraction fracture length flow boundary conditions etc is the same as used in application 1 conceptually the infiltration of acidic water from the inlet boundary brings acidity into the system first through the flowing fractures which are represented by the primary continuum acidity later diffuses into the rock matrix due to the existing chemical gradient between resident and boundary water thus matrix diffusion represents a sink term for the acidity in the absence of geochemical reactions this sink term would progressively vanish once the pore water in the matrix is equilibrated with the fracture filling water in practice close to the inlet boundary these coupled diffusive processes lead to calcite under saturation in the rock matrix bordering the fractures where eq 22 proceeds from the left to the right the consumption of acidity maintains the chemical gradient and the related sink term in the primary continuum significant changes in this system are expected to occur only when calcite is progressively depleted the pflotran calculation was carried out in the supercomputer jureca jülich supercomputing centre 2018 of the jülich supercomputing centre and the simulation time frame was 10 000 years the model discretisation is the same as described in section 5 1 and used in application 1 with the difference that here four primary species are included which implies that the simulation involves a total of 352 321 536 transport degrees of freedom the simulation was run using 680 processor cores and a total of 490 000 h of supercomputing time was used snapshots of ph computed at 100 y and 10 000 y are shown in fig 8 for visualisation purposes here only cells with ϵ f 1 0 6 are shown low ph water is only found in close proximity to the inlet boundary and a modest additional penetration is seen from 100 y to 10 000 y which clearly indicates that acidity is strongly buffered by matrix diffusion and the related calcite dissolution processes in the rock matrix a detailed analysis of the chemical profiles in the rock matrix was performed considering a section of borehole b5 fig 3 which is located close to the inlet boundary the considered section is at depth 45 m the profiles of tracer concentration are shown in fig 9 whereas the profiles of calcium bicarbonate ph and calcite consumption are shown in fig 10 for all the considered species and geochemical variables profiles are shown at time 1000 y and 10 000 y from fig 9 it can be seen that at the end of the simulation the rock matrix is close to equilibrium with the inflowing boundary water that contains the tracer this is not surprising since the chosen section is located close to the inlet boundary and the chosen tracer behaves as a non sorbing non decaying species the analysis of the reactive system fig 10 shows that in the considered borehole section after 1000 y calcite is modestly depleted in a narrow fringe close to the fracture matrix interface calcite dissolution leads to an increase of calcium and bicarbonate concentrations that diffuse beyond the reaction front very modest changes in ph are observed as a result of calcite buffering at the end of the simulation 10 000 y calcite is completely depleted in the first few millimeters of the matrix which explains the modest drop in ph calcium and bicarbonate concentrations behind the reaction front the penetration depth of the reaction front at the end of the simulation is very limited and this is related to diffusion limitations which are confirmed by an analysis of the related damköhler number lichtner and kang 2007 23 d a i i k s a s l c 2 ϕ m d m c 0 here the characteristic length has been set approximately equal to penetration depth l c 1 0 1 0 2 m and c 0 is set equal to the calcium concentration in the resident water table 7 these parameters give d a i i 13 8 which further confirms that the reaction front in the rock matrix is diffusion controlled 6 discussion and conclusions we have presented a conceptual framework for the parameterisation of dfn based ecpm reactive transport models of fractured media and discussed its numerical deployment using the existing massively parallel code pflotran the framework is suited for geological media displaying a dual porosity behaviour i e systems where groundwater flow occurs in a sparse network of connected fractures whereas the bordering rock matrix is accessible by dissolved solutes through molecular diffusion only the study leads to the following general conclusions and recommendations 1 evidence from natural analogues studies chapman et al 1991 nordstrom et al 1992 romero et al 1992 cramer and smellie 1994 cera et al 2002 akagawa et al 2006 and from lab and site investigation programmes skb 2010 poteri et al 2017a b has pointed out that in sparsely fractured media the rock matrix plays a key role for the retardation of harmful contaminants such as radionuclides and is also an important geochemical buffer against possible perturbations such as the infiltration of acidic water from the surface 2 continuum based ecpm representations of the fractured media are numerically appealing formulations for reactive transport modelling 3 given 1 and 2 ecpm models must explicitly account for mass exchange between the flowing fractures and the rock matrix as well as for geochemical reactions in both regions 4 given 3 the dual continuum disconnected matrix model dcdmm is an appealing approach for large scale reactive transport modelling in fractured media since the secondary continuum solve is embarrassingly parallel 5 given 3 the parameterisation of the dcdmm needs to be consistent with the underlying statistics of the fractured medium which are typically formalised into a discrete fracture network model this consistency is here ensured by preserving the local fracture volume fraction and fracture bulk specific surface area a verification exercise based on two consecutive fracture segments has been used to check both the conceptual robustness of the parameterisation approach and the proper implementation of the parameterisation strategy in the chosen numerical code demonstrative simulations carried out using pflotran in the super computer jureca have shown the suitability of the proposed approach for large scale reactive transport modelling in sparsely fractured rocks a simplification of the presented large scale models is that both geochemical reactions and transport properties are assumed to be constant through the entire rock matrix in real fractured systems the matrix bordering a flowing fracture might have experienced significant alteration and this might have enhanced or decreased diffusive mass exchanges e g wogelius et al 2020 moreover geochemical reactions depend on the availability of relevant minerals which might be sparsely available across the rock matrix trinchero et al 2019b in summary both matrix and fracture internal heterogeneity might have an impact on the hydrogeochemical evolution of a fractured system this impact should be addressed quantitatively using fit for purpose numerical models which might in principle be based on the dcdmm formulation presented here credit

concentration c 0 is prescribed at the inlet of the flowing fracture dirichlet boundary condition and describes the evolution of resident concentration at any monitoring point of the fracture although the solution is provided in geometric ordinary space it is much more convenient to use here the solution as derived in laplace space thus considering a non decaying non sorbing solute the solution reads a 1 c c 0 s exp ω exp γ where c is the laplace transform of the resident concentration at the monitoring point the first term on the right hand side of eq a 5 represents the laplace transform of the dirichlet boundary condition and s is the laplace variable the arguments of the two exponential functions are a 2 ω τ 2 α d m v and a 3 γ ω 1 4 d m α v v 2 s κ b tanh s d p δ s 1 2 where τ y is the groundwater travel time from the inlet to the monitoring point in the fracture v m y is the groundwater velocity α m is the longitudinal dispersivity d m m 2 y is the molecular diffusion coefficient in pure water δ m is the matrix length and κ is a material parameter group defined as a 4 κ φ d p where φ is the matrix porosity and d p m 2 y is the pore diffusion coefficient in matrix for n consecutive fractures the breakthrough curve at the end of the n th fracture can be computed as a 5 c c 0 s exp ω 1 exp γ 1 exp ω n exp γ n the numerical inversion of the laplace solution is here carried out using the de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 hollenbeck 1998 appendix b verification of the two fractures model against marfa the results of the pflotran calculation for the two fractures model section 4 are here compared to a simulation carried out using the time domain random walk computer code marfa the comparison was made in terms of mass flux ω mol y through the df outlet normalised by mass flux at late times ω lim t ω t for the pflotran model mass fluxes where computed using eq 9a in marfa transport along a fracture is described by two hydrodynamic parameters the groundwater travel time and the transport resistance the latter is defined as cvetkovic et al 1999 b 1 β τ 0 τ d θ b θ where b is the fracture half aperture and θ is a dummy integration variable neglecting fracture internal variability in openings the transport resistance reduces to β τ b the groundwater travel times of the two fracture segments as well as the longitudinal dispersivity used in the marfa simulation are listed in table 3 whereas the transport resistance was set equal to 3 72 y m for both segments notice that β u f β d f since the wider aperture of the df compensates its longer groundwater travel time the results of the comparison exercise are shown in fig b 11 the results of the dual continuum ecpm model and the time domain random walk simulation agree well this provides a further verification of the dcdmm model 
2743,water resources in semi arid and arid regions are critical for sustainable agricultural development and climate change imposes great challenges and brings about large uncertainties in water resource management and crop production in this study the effects of future climate change on hydrology and corn production in the u s high plains region were assessed using a newly developed swat co2 model and gcms under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios specifically a new method to dynamically input annual co2 concentration into swat was developed this method along with the swat default co2 concentration 330 ppm and a constant co2 input option one average co2 concentration for a simulation period were compared for simulating hydrology and corn yield in 21st century 2031 2100 results showed the default co2 concentration continuously simulated the highest crop evapotranspiration etc and irrigation but the lowest water yield and corn yield among three methods especially under the rcp8 5 scenario however the etc and irrigation were higher for the dynamic input method before the mid 21st century and lower between mid to late 21st century than for the constant input method the contrast results were found for the corn yield simulations additionally the improved swat co2 model was applied to predict the changes in hydrology and corn yields for three centuries 2031 2298 relative to the historical period 1970 1999 results indicated that the overall trend of future irrigation etc and corn yield could decrease significantly at the three sites compared to the historical period the impacts of dramatically elevated co2 and logarithmic increase in air temperatures were the key factors for the above changes the study highlighted the necessity of considering the dynamic co2 input for the swat applications in climate change studies long term projected results of this study can inform local producers about the risks of future climate change in this water shortage environment keywords hydrological modeling swat co2 global climate change general circulation models gcms irrigated agriculture u s high plains data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the rapid development of modern societies along with an increased global population and economy have been fueled by a steady increase in the burning of fossil fuels for decades as a result climatic change has emerged due to the rising concentrations of greenhouse gases the most visible evidence of climate change is rising air temperatures which are closely associated with changes in the global water cycle el shehawy et al 2012 the 2015 paris agreement on climate change committed to limiting global average temperature increases to 2 c and pursuing efforts to achieve temperature increases of 1 5 c above pre industrial levels united nations framework convention on climate 2015 this agreement attempts to mitigate the overall impacts of climate change and reduce the occurrence of extreme events lewis et al 2019 therefore assessing the potential impacts of future climate change provide an invaluable and essential contribution to achieving carbon emission reductions for reducing global temperatures and associated negative impacts for the world qian et al 2021 simulation modeling has shown that climate change can have great impacts on hydrology and crop yields chen et al 2021 for instance it is predicted that by the end of 21st century climate change may result in a 16 3 reduction in global water use efficiency under a high emission scenario and a 2 2 reduction under a low emission scenario pan et al 2018 agriculture and climate change are inseparably linked and agricultural systems are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change factors related to agricultural production such as co2 concentration air temperature precipitation solar radiation and other factors are affected by climate change feng et al 2021 marras et al 2021 therefore global climate change is widely recognized as one of the most significant challenges faced by agriculture today it is necessary to explore the impact of climate change on the hydrologic cycle and crop production particularly across various climatic regions climate projections from the ipcc fifth assessment report ar5 were based on the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 which focused on representative concentration pathways rcps for future climate projections by various general circulation models gcms rogelj et al 2012 sheffield et al 2013 the gcm outputs of cmip5 have been widely used to study climate change related scenarios at regional and global scales zhang et al 2019 thus cmip5 projections could provide a good basis for the assessment of hydrological variables and crop growth parameters yuan et al 2020 the use of the watershed scale soil and water assessment tool swat facilitates the study of the impact of climate change on the regional water balance and crop production tan et al 2022 wang et al 2020 water resources are limited in the southwest united states u s and irrigated agriculture is a major economic contributor to the u s high plains region which relies heavily on the ogallala aquifer as an irrigation source rudnick et al 2019 corn zea mays l is one of the major field crops planted under irrigated conditions in the u s high plains national agricultural statistics service nass 2021 therefore three corn production sites in the u s high plains were selected for climate change evaluation in this study including fields in nebraska kansas and texas ranging from north to south representing different regional climates the existing method for simulating co2 concentration in swat is problematic in that it only allows for a static input value for co2 concentration that remains constant for the entire simulation period which has limitations for long term future climate change simulations in this study a dynamic co2 input method was developed to allow for varying annual co2 values in the swat model this development is both more flexible and realistic for long term continuous simulations and essential for assessing future climate change on water balance and crop growth tan et al 2020 wang et al 2017 such an approach is also more convenient and computationally efficient than splitting long term simulations into numerous smaller simulation scenarios it also likely allows for prediction results to be more representative and accurate in addition the previous studies of climate change lack long term simulations such as those from 2031 to 2300 in this study climate data from four gcms and two rcp scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 based on the cmip5 for three sites nebraska kansas and texas in the u s high plains were used to drive an improved swat model with the management allowed depletion mad auto irrigation algorithm and dynamic co2 input method an assessment was undertaken to determine the impact of projected future climate change on hydrology and corn yields in the u s high plains specifically the objectives of this study were to 1 develop a new method for dynamically inputting co2 annual concentrations into the swat model 2 compare the differences in the effects of three co2 input methods swat default co2 input 330 ppm constant co2 input one average value and dynamic co2 input on the hydrologic cycle and corn yields in the u s high plains during 2031 to 2100 and 3 assess the long term impacts of climate change on hydrology and corn yields across the u s high plains from 2031 to 2298 using the newly developed dynamic co2 input method compared with the historical period 1970 1999 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites three field study sites located in the u s high plains were chosen for use in this study their locations were north platte nebraska 41 2 n 100 9 w approximately 861 m above sea level garden city kansas 38 0 n 100 8 w approximately 887 m and bushland texas 35 2 n 102 1 w approximately 1171 m fig 1 all three study sites are classified as having a semi arid climate peel et al 2007 although air temperature and rainfall regimes vary the u s high plains area is the most important region for irrigated corn production in the nation the average annual precipitation for the nebraska site was 506 mm the mean annual maximum air temperature was 17 3 c and the minimum air temperature was 2 8 c the soil type at the nebraska site was classified as cozad silt loam soil survey staff 2010 the kansas site had an average annual precipitation of 439 mm an average annual maximum air temperature of 21 2 c and a minimum air temperature of 4 3 c the soil type was ulysses silt loam at the kansas site for the texas site the average annual precipitation was less than those for nebraska and kansas at 346 mm with average annual maximum and minimum air temperatures of 22 3 c and 3 7 c respectively the soil type at the texas site was pullman silt clay loam 2 2 cmip5 future climate data the cmip5 future climate data used in this study were downloaded from the c3s climate data store https cds climate copernicus eu cdsapp dataset projections cmip5 daily single

and mpl esm lr mpi germany the rcp4 5 scenario was a medium forcing scenario which had a stable radiative forcing of 4 5 w m 2 by 2100 and the rcp8 5 scenario was a high forcing scenario which had a stable radiative forcing of 8 5 w m 2 by 2100 van vuuren et al 2011 2 3 swat swat mad and swat co2 models 2 3 1 swat model the swat model is a continuous time semi distributed process based watershed scale model arnold et al 2012 it is a physically based hydrologic model that simulates crop growth hydrology and water quality its primary model components include a weather simulator hydrology plant growth and land management as well as loads and fluxes of sediment nutrients pesticides bacteria and pathogens the swat model is described in detail by neitsch et al 2011 the swat2012 revision 664 was used in this study the swat model simulates hydrological processes in the soil profile based on the water balance equation eq 1 including precipitation irrigation surface runoff evapotranspiration lateral flow and percolation arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 1 s w t s w o i 1 n r day i day q surf e t a q lat w seep where sw t is the final soil water content mm sw o is the initial soil water content mm t is the time step day r day is the amount of precipitation on day i or snowmelt mm i day is the amount of irrigation on day i mm q surf is the amount of surface runoff on day i mm et a is the amount of actual evapotranspiration on day i mm q lat is the amount of lateral flow on day i mm and w seep is the amount of percolation on day i mm the surface runoff is determined by a modified soil conservation service scs curve number method mishra and singh 2013 a kinematic storage model is used to calculate lateral flow sloan and moore 1984 a tipping bucket algorithm is used to simulate soil water flow arnold et al 2011 neitsch et al 2011 percolating water from the lowest soil layer enters the vadose zone and is ultimately recharged to the aquifer evapotranspiration for the swat model can be calculated by three different methods which include the penman monteith method monteith 1965 the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 and the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 the penman monteith method was used to simulate evapotranspiration in this study plant growth was modulated using heat unit theory according to plant specific input parameters which were summarized in the plant growth database neitsch et al 2011 swat first calculates potential growth using a leaf area index lai function determined by accumulated heat units light interception and converted intercepted light into biomass through radiation use efficiency actual growth is then calculated from the potential growth attributed to stresses such as extreme temperatures and deficiencies of water and nutrients i e nitrogen and phosphorus finally swat calculates crop yield as a portion of total biomass using harvest index and partitions a part of dry crop biomass as dry economic yield arnold et al 2011 cmip5 future climate data including daily precipitation and maximum minimum air temperatures were projected by four gcms in this study the wxgen weather generator model sharpley and williams 1990 which was embedded in the swat model was used to simulate future daily solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity for this weather generator model it was presumed that the signatures of solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity would remain consistent with current levels under different future scenarios which meant that precipitation and air temperatures were the major contributors to future hydrology and crop growth 2 3 2 swat management allowed depletion auto irrigation swat mad model in practice producers are willing to allow a maximum percentage of plant available water depletion before irrigation is triggered this concept is known as management allowed depletion mad a common framework for irrigation scheduling as outlined by merriam 1966 mad irrigation management has been widely applied in semi arid arid regions including texas kansas and nebraska in the u s callison 2012 evett et al 2011 payero et al 2008 for most crop production a 50 mad value represents a reasonable overall value for avoiding apparent crop water stress callison 2012 usda nrcs 2017 as for water sensitive crops or heavily compacted soils a smaller range of depletion may be needed 30 50 mad a larger mad value can be used 50 70 for stress tolerant crops or well structured soils the current default auto irrigation function in swat is unable to simulate mad irrigation management explicitly however irrigation scheduling based on the mad concept is becoming widely used marek et al 2011 evett et al 2011 as a result a mad based swat auto irrigation algorithm is required for accurate simulation of actual irrigation operations a mad based automatic irrigation algorithm based on a user defined permissible percentage of plant available water depletion determined by the maximum crop specific root depth and soil properties was developed for swat by chen et al 2018 mad values approaching zero denote irrigation management frequencies that result in low plant water stress conversely values approaching one result in irrigation management that leads to greater plant water stress as expressed in eq 2 2 s o l s u m f c s o l s w p a w m a d where sol sumfc is the amount of water held in the soil profile at field capacity mm sol sw is the amount of water stored in soil profile on any given day mm paw is plant available water determined primarily by soil texture and plant specific maximum rooting depth and mad is the management allowed depletion percentage user defined water stress threshold that triggers irrigation expressed as a decimal value ranging from 0 to 1 2 3 3 swat co2 dynamic input method co2 concentration is very important for swat model simulations swat adjusts crop radiation use efficiency rue according to different values of atmospheric co2 concentrations so as to change both the conversion efficiency of crop photosynthesis and the accumulation of crop biomass however the swat default co2 concentration is set to 330 ppm the default value can be changed by swat users but remains fixed at that value for the duration of the simulation as such different co2 concentrations cannot be assigned for different years within a single simulation which prevents simulation of increasing co2 concentrations over time in long term simulations this condition represents a critical deficiency in swat as co2 concentrations increase gradually over time under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios to overcome this problem some scholars have modified the maximum stomatal conductance of crops to reflect the impact of co2 concentration changes on crops wu et al 2012a 2012b butcher et al 2014 chen et al 2019 compensated for the low default co2 concentrations in future climate scenarios by dividing the simulation duration into multiple time periods and inputting the average co2 concentrations for the future climate simulation periods furthermore some scholars modified the swat subroutine to output co2 and consider the dynamics of co2 emissions melaku et al 2022 qi et al 2020 however the above methods cannot fundamentally solve the problem of using dynamic co2 concentration in swat and associated simulation results likely include intrinsic errors not easily discerned therefore the development of dynamic co2 input method is both necessary and timely given current international interest in climate change simulation in this study a dynamic co2 input method was developed to incorporate projected ipcc annual co2 concentration data as input data for the swat model thus allowing for simulations using changing annual co2 concentrations in this study we created an input text file named co2con with annual co2 concentrations derived from ipcc a subroutine readco2 f was developed to read annual co2 concentration values in co2con file for dynamic co2 simulations specifically a global variable co2con was defined and used to receive the co2 concentration of current simulation year and then used in hru level subroutines the escalated co2 concentrations influenced the plant canopy resistance eqs 3 and 4 which further altered the potential evapotranspiration pet calculation furthermore radiation use efficiency was also adjusted by elevated co2 concentrations eq 5 given as 3 r c 0 5 g l co 2 l a i 1 4 g l co 2 g l 1 4 0 4 co 2 330 where r c is the plant canopy resistance m s 1 g l is the maximum conductance of a single leaf m s 1 lai is the leaf area index of the canopy g l co 2 is the leaf conductance modified to reflect co2 effects m s 1 and co 2 is the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere ppm 5 rue 100 co 2 co 2 e x p r 1 r 2 co 2 where rue is the radiation use efficiency which was defined as dry biomass generated for each unit of intercepted solar radiation kg ha mj m2 1 and r 1 and r 2 are shape coefficients 2 4 model setup and evaluation the daily meteorological data for nebraska kansas and texas sites were obtained from the high plains regional climate center hprcc weather network https hprcc unl edu including precipitation and maximum minimum air temperatures measured hydrologic and agronomic data for the texas site in 2013 and 2016 included lysimeter measured daily crop evapotranspiration etc actual irrigation lai and aboveground biomass for corn whereas only actual irrigation data were collected for the nebraska and kansas sites chen et al 2019a the swat mad simulated irrigation was compared to actual irrigation at all three study sites for model evaluation evaluation was performed at the hydrological response unit hru level with measured daily etc lai and aboveground biomass for texas site evaluation of irrigation using the swat mad model was conducted for all three sites the calibrated parameters for texas from 2000 to 2010 were obtained from chen et al 2018 while nebraska and kansas sites used a parameter regionalization calibration method chen et al 2019a swat mad performance for simulated irrigation was analyzed using percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 coefficient of determination r2 legates and mccabe 1999 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 statistics 2 5 scenario design 2 5 1 three co2 input methods for 2031 2100 to better represent the impacts of co2 concentrations in model simulations of major hydrologic variables and crop yield under future climate change scenarios three different methods for simulating co2 concentration were used 1 the swat default value of 330 ppm 2 a constant value of 506 or 661 ppm calculated as the average concentration over the simulation period of 2031 2100 using the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively and 3 the dynamic co2 input method introduced in this study which used different concentration values for each year table 1 these co2 concentration simulation approaches were termed the default input constant input and dynamic input methods 2 5 2 study periods 1970 1999 and 2031 2298 the historical period of 1970 1999 was used as the baseline scenario future climate change simulations considered the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios based on four gcms from cmip5 the future climate projections 2031 2298 were divided into nine 30 year periods 2031 2060 2061 2090 2091 2120 2121 2150 2151 2180 2181 2210 2211 2240 2241 2270 and 2271 2298 the first five years of data e g 2026 2030 before the start of each period e g 2031 2060 were used for the swat model warmup the dynamic co2 input method was used in this long term simulation table 1 2 6 statistical analysis to compare the differences between the three co2 input methods from 2031 to 2100 for hydrology and corn yield at the three sites of nebraska kansas and texas the one way anova method was used to determine significant differences in the means of multiple samples under the influence of a single control variable samples having significant differences p 0 05 were indicated using letter designations e g a b and c in addition a linear fit method was used to test the significance of the long term trends for 2031 2100 and 2031 2298 the t test student s t test was used to test the significance level for the ensemble mean of four gcms from 2031 to 2298 i e nine 30 year time periods with respect to the historical period a nonparametric test namely wilcoxon s rank sum test a rank based reciprocity test was used for data that were not normally distributed 3 results 3 1 model performance evaluation the model performance demonstrated satisfactory agreement between simulated and observed etc lai and aboveground biomass for the texas site the nse r2 and pbias values for daily etc were 0 75 0 81 and 11 7 for the 2013 and 2016 simulation periods respectively table 2 lai matched well with observed data with nse r2 and pbias values of 0 86 0 88 and 5 9 respectively the simulated and observed values of aboveground biomass also agreed well with nse r2 and pbias of 0 84 0 86 and 5 3 respectively table 2 the nse r2 and pbias values for the swat mad simulated monthly irrigation amount at the texas site were 0 81 0 83 and 0 4 respectively table 2 compared to the actual irrigation amounts the swat mad simulated monthly irrigation amounts for the kansas site had nse r2 and pbias values of 0 70 0 71 and 16 4 respectively from 2005 to 2012 for the nebraska site the nse r2 and pbias were 0 56 0 56 and 3 9 respectively using the swat mad model for monthly irrigation amounts from 2003 to 2006 table 2 the results indicated a satisfactory model performance for all three sites 3 2 comparisons of simulated etc irrigation water yield and corn yield using three co2 input methods 3 2 1 difference in simulated etc under the rcp4 5 scenario the default co2 input method simulated the greatest etc across locations from 2031 to 2100 p 0 05 while there was no significant difference in etc simulations using the constant and dynamic input methods across the three sites table 3 furthermore the default and constant input methods indicated a significant increasing trend in simulated etc from 2031 to 2100 under the rcp4 5 scenario fig 2 a1 a3 whereas the dynamic input method did not show a marked trend fig 2a1 a3 it is worth noting that the margin of difference for the simulated etc between the default input method and the other two input methods tended to increase with the decreasing latitude at the three sites table 3 fig 2a1 a3 similar to the rcp4 5 scenario the default method predicted the greatest etc among the three input methods under the rcp8 5 scenario table 3 fig 3 a1 a3 and there was a significant increasing trend greater slope than rcp4 5 for both the default and constant input methods from 2031 to 2100 contrary to the rcp4 5 scenario predicted etc for the dynamic input method showed a significant decreasing trend fig 3a1 a3 while the simulated etc using the dynamic input method was greater than that of the constant input method before 2065 and less than that of the constant input after 2076 for the nebraska and kansas sites the predicted average etc among the three methods all showed significant differences table 3 similar to the rcp4 5 scenario the difference in simulated etc among the three methods became more pronounced in the lower latitudes figs 2 and 3 3 2 2 comparison of simulated irrigation similar to the etc results the default co2 input method also simulated the greatest amount of irrigation relative to the other two input methods under the rcp4 5 scenario p 0 05 table 3 fig 2b1 b3 however there were no significant differential trends over time using different input methods across the three sites fig 2b1 b3 in general the average irrigation was larger for the kansas ranging from 100 0 to 119 8 mm and texas ranging from 64 7 to 92 5 mm sites as compared to the nebraska site ranging from 13 6 to 22 6 mm table 3 for the rcp8 5 scenario predicted average irrigation using the default input method was significantly greater than values for the constant and dynamic input methods table 3 moreover predicted irrigation showed a significant upward trend from 2031 to 2100 under the default and constant input methods at all three sites whereas there were significant decreasing trends for the kansas and texas sites using the dynamic input method fig 3b1 b3 3 2 3 influence on water yield by three co2 input methods under the rcp4 5 scenario the average annual water yield for the constant and dynamic input methods were significantly greater p 0 05 than the default input method table 3 fig 2c1 c3 across three sites table 3 no significant differential trend from 2031 to 2100 was found for predicted water yield using the three input methods across the three sites fig 2c1 c3 water yield decreased with decreasing latitude for all three co2 input methods table 3 fig 2c1 c3 under the rcp8 5 scenario average annual water yield simulated by the default input method remained significantly less than the other two methods across locations table 3 unlike the rcp4 5 scenario the trendline in water yield increased significantly using the dynamic method for the nebraska site fig 3c1 and for the kansas and texas sites the trendlines decreased significantly with the default and constant input methods fig 3c2 and c3 3 2 4 impact on corn yield using three input methods the constant and dynamic input methods showed no significant difference for corn yield but their predictions were significantly greater p 0 05 than the default input method under the rcp4 5 scenario table 3 fig 2d1 d3 furthermore the trendlines for all three methods were significantly decreased at all sites fig 2d1 d3 and the yield gap between the constant dynamic input methods and the default input method increased with the decreasing latitudes under the rcp8 5 scenario predicted average corn yields were lowest using the default input method table 3 fig 3d1 d3 simulated yields using the dynamic input were less than those using the constant input in the first half of the study period 2031 to mid 21st century for the texas site and greater for those in the later part late mid 21st century to 2100 fig 3d3 this can be explained by the co2 fertilizer effect when a dynamic increase in co2 concentration was simulated using the dynamic co2 input method predicted corn yield showed a significant declining trend for all three input methods across all three sites figs 2 and 3d1 d3 3 3 projected future climate from 2031 to 2298 3 3 1 projected precipitation for all three sites average annual precipitation increased significantly p 0 05 over nine 30 year periods from 2031 to 2298 as compared to the historical period 1970 1999 under both the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios except for 2081 2210 of rcp8 5 for the texas site fig 4 on average from 2031 to 2298 precipitation increased significantly by 42 5 and 40 9 for the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios in the nebraska site 41 0 and 28 7 in the kansas site and 36 9 and 18 1 in the texas site respectively compared to the historical period fig 4 simultaneously there were significant increasing trends in the simulated precipitation over time for the nebraska site in both rcp scenarios and for the texas site using the rcp8 5 scenario fig 4a and c the precipitation anomalies were obviously increased for the texas site with the greatest percentage change anomaly of nearly 300 between 2121 and 2150 for the rcp4 5 scenario fig 4c 3 3 2 projected maximum and minimum air temperatures maximum and minimum air temperatures increased significantly p 0 05 over the nine 30 year periods compared to the historical period under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios in three sites fig 5 both maximum and minimum air temperatures showed significant increasing trends from 2031 to 2298 under both rcp scenarios with a logarithmic form for the rcp8 5 scenario fig 5 under the rcp4 5 scenario the mean values of maximum air temperature during the entire study period 2031 2298 increased by 1 30 c 2 07 c and 2 09 c relative to the historical period for the nebraska kansas and texas sites respectively under the rcp8 5 scenario the average maximum air temperature increases were greater as compared to the rcp4 5 scenario gradually increasing with decreasing latitude with 7 43 c 8 39 c and 8 56 c from north to south for the three sites fig 5 it is worth noting that the increase in the minimum air temperature was much greater than that of the maximum air temperature fig 6 with the entire period under the rcp4 5 scenario significantly increased by approximately 6 c the average increases were 6 05 c 6 78 c and 6 58 c for the nebraska kansas and texas sites in addition minimum air temperature increased significantly by approximately 5 c during the initial study period 2031 2060 and by approximately 17 c at the end of the 23rd century 2271 2298 for all three sites under the rcp8 5 scenario 3 4 long term climate change impacts on etc irrigation water yield and crop yield using the dynamic co2 input method for three centuries 3 4 1 changes in etc for the nebraska site etc was significantly less p 0 05 than the historical period from the 21st century to the first half of the 23rd century 2031 to 2240 under the rcp4 5 scenario fig 7 a with an average decrease of 2 9 over the entire period 2031 to 2298 although predicted etc was lower relative to the historical period for most 30 year periods the trend increased significantly from 2031 to 2298 for the rcp8 5 scenario etc was significantly lower than the historical period for all nine 30 year periods fig 7a the average percentage decrease in etc was 24 7 over the entire study period for the rcp8 5 scenario fig 7a for the kansas site a significant increase was found for etc from 2031 to 2060 and from 2121 to 2210 under the rcp4 5 scenario and a significant decrease for the periods of 2061 2298 were identified under the rcp8 5 scenario compared to the historical period the mean values of percent change in etc were 2 5 and 19 0 for the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios p 0 05 no significant differential trend of etc for the kansas site was determined under either rcp scenario fig 7b for the texas site etc increased significantly from 2031 to 2120 and from 2241 to 2298 as compared to the historical period with a significant average increase of 3 5 for the entire period under the rcp4 5 scenario the average percent decrease in etc was approximately 24 0 from 2031 to 2298 p 0 05 with a significant declining trend over time under the rcp8 5 scenario fig 7c 3 4 2 variations in irrigation in general average annual irrigation for most future periods was predicted to be less than that of the historical period under the rcp4 5 scenario with an average decrease of 56 7 20 3 and 56 7 from 2031 to 2298 for sites in nebraska kansas and texas respectively fig 8 however the trend in irrigation varied across the three sites with the nebraska site having an increasing trend and the texas site having a decreasing trend over time p 0 05 for the rcp8 5 scenario predicted irrigation was significantly lower than the historical period with an average percentage decrease of 96 0 63 9 and 87 3 for sites in nebraska kansas and texas respectively and all had a significant decreasing trend in irrigation fig 8 note that in the nebraska and texas sites there was virtually no simulated irrigation between 2091 and 2298 3 4 3 water yield dynamics for the nebraska and texas sites water yield was significantly increased p 0 05 for nine 30 year periods as compared to the historical period under both rcp scenarios fig 9 a and c an average of 242 4 and 365 0 mm for rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively was found for the nebraska site and 569 5 and 855 7 mm for the texas site p 0 05 the water yield for the kansas site also increased significantly under both rcp scenarios however the water yield increase in the kansas site was markedly less than those for the nebraska and texas sites averaging 30 4 and 32 7 mm for the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively the changing trend over time in water yield of all sites was not significant except for the nebraska site under the rcp8 5 scenario p 0 05 fig 9 3 4 4 corn yield response overall predicted average crop yield for the nine 30 year periods was less than the historical period for all three sites under both rcp scenarios p 0 05 fig 10 average reductions over the entire study period of 27 3 and 63 7 for the rcp4 5 and 8 5 respectively were found for the nebraska site 30 8 and 68 2 for the kansas site and 22 5 and 62 3 for the texas site the overall trend in yield over time under the rcp4 5 scenario was relatively stable for the nebraska and kansas sites and increased significantly for the texas site however under the rcp8 5 scenario the trend in yield significantly decreased in a logarithmic form across all sites fig 10 3 5 regional differences in simulated etc irrigation water yield and crop yield using dynamic input method across various climatic locations for the rcp4 5 scenario there was a significant difference p 0 05 in the average etc from 2031 to 2298 across locations with etc values of approximately 509 9 mm 605 5 mm and 587 4 mm from north to south table 4 the average amounts of irrigation significantly differed among the three sites and the future irrigation requirement for corn production was greatest for the kansas site at approximately 98 6 mm water yield decreased significantly with decreasing latitudes for the nebraska kansas and texas sites by approximately 198 1 mm 172 5 mm and 78 4 mm respectively this demonstrated that nebraska was more vulnerable to the risk of runoff in the future however corn yield was greater for the nebraska site at approximately 7 6 mg ha 1 and significantly larger than the texas site table 4 under the rcp8 5 scenario the regional variations in simulated mean values of etc and irrigation were similar to that of the rcp4 5 scenario table 4 both etc and irrigation were greatest p 0 05 for the kansas site with 478 5 and 44 7 mm respectively and lowest for the nebraska site p 0 05 table 4 mean values of water yield decreased significantly from north to south with 289 8 186 4 and 115 9 mm for the nebraska kansas and texas sites respectively nevertheless the simulated mean values of corn yield for the nebraska site were numerically greater than those for the kansas site but no significant difference was found between the two sites yield for the texas site was significantly less than the other two sites and was approximately 3 3 mg ha 1 thus indicating a noticeable food security issue in texas in the future table 4 4 discussion 4 1 effects of co2 input methods on hydrology and crop yield when using the swat model to predict and analyze the effects of future climate change on hydrology and crop growth the co2 input in the model was an important influencing factor the lack of an option for dynamic input of co2 concentrations in the current swat model limited its efficacy for assessing the impacts of future climate change gao et al 2020 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 therefore this study developed and incorporated a dynamic co2 input method into swat and compared the differences of major hydrologic variables and corn yields by applying three different co2 input methods from 2031 to 2100 among the three input methods the default input method simulated the highest etc and irrigation continuously but simulated the least water yield and corn yield figs 2 and 3 furthermore the simulated etc and irrigation using the dynamic input method were greater than those of the constant input method in the first half of the simulation period and lower in the later period which highlighted the importance of considering the rising co2 levels in the future for water cycling in contrast the simulated corn yields using the dynamic input method were less than those using the constant input method in the first half period and greater than those of the constant input method in the second half period generally similar results were more evident under the rcp8 5 scenario these findings emphasized the positive effect of co2 on crop yield boost it is notable that under the rcp8 5 scenario the simulated yield for the texas site was greater for the constant input method relative to the dynamic input method at the beginning of the 21st century however by the end of the 21st century greater yield values were simulated by the dynamic input approach even though the difference was reduced when compared to the constant input method fig 3 this could be explained by the fact that at the beginning of the 21st century the increase in air temperature was relatively smaller compared to the historical period and there was less temperature stress for corn growth yields at this stage were likely more sensitive to the co2 fertilizer effect however there was a considerable increase in both maximum and minimum air temperatures over time under the rcp8 5 scenario the limiting effect of temperature stress on corn far exceeded the extent to which yield was positively affected by the elevated co2 concentrations at the end of the 21st century this also explains why corn yields differed less between the dynamic and constant input methods later in the study period furthermore the logarithmic rise in air temperatures and logarithmic drop in yields provided evidence for the above explanations figs 5 6 and 10 both the constant and dynamic input methods differed significantly from the default input method in simulating hydrologic and yield factors therefore this new method for dynamic co2 inputs was necessary for reducing the uncertainty in predicting future climate change impacts compared to previous swat studies of no change or using a single input co2 value 4 2 exploring the causes of future climate change on hydrology and corn yields in this study future etc irrigation and corn yield using the newly developed dynamic input method were predicted to decrease for the nebraska kansas and texas sites with increasing water yield especially in the rcp8 5 scenario under the future climate scenarios the decreases in etc and irrigation were mainly due to the closure of crop stomata and suppression of transpiration caused by the elevated co2 concentrations bunce and nasyrov 2012 for example liu et al 2021 found that stomatal closure and decreased stomatal conductivity negatively affected corn evapotranspiration through a two year field experiment in northeast china this study showed that changes in future corn yield vary distinctively with geographic locations such as with the nebraska kansas and texas sites from the north to south which were sequentially lower in latitude by 3 and spanned different climatic locations this is consistent with other studies showing that spatial and geographic variations could affect crop yields asseng et al 2019 fletcher et al 2020 shin et al 2017 under both the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios corn yield was greater for the nebraska site and significantly larger than the texas site p 0 05 not only under the future climate but during the historical period corn yields from nebraska were greater than those in kansas and texas which also had lower yields and large yield gaps kucharik et al 2020 nebraska is abundant in precipitation during the corn growing season with greater humidity which has a positive impact on corn yields in contrast kansas and texas are located in the middle and south of the u s high plains and often experience extreme climate conditions such as high temperatures and drought which are the main reasons for lower corn yields in both regions kucharik et al 2020 this study predicted reductions in corn yields from the 21st century to the 23rd century under both the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios particularly rcp8 5 suggested crop yield reductions of more than 80 by the end of the 23rd century as compared to the historical period many studies have evaluated the impact of climate change on global agricultural systems under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios and found that crop yields were highly vulnerable to future climate change ketiem et al 2017 leng 2018 tan et al 2022 wang et al 2018 the warming climate can negatively affect corn yield which is mainly due to greater air temperatures that increase the rate of development and maturation and shorten the growing period of corn bassu et al 2014 chen et al 2019b wechsung et al 2021 in this study the simulated reduction in corn yield was associated with a considerable increase in future air temperatures at the study sites the similar trend of logarithmic increase in air temperatures and logarithmic decrease in yield under the rcp8 5 scenario in this study provided further evidence figs 5 6 and 10 few studies have projected climate change impacts on hydrology and crop yield for the next three centuries due to the higher uncertainty associated with longer projections however this study is a worthy undertaking to provide valuable insights into long term climate change impacts on water resources and agriculture sustainability using the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios to constrain projections this study offers possible ranges of what can happen in the future with different feasible mitigation efforts 5 conclusions an improved swat model equipped with a dynamic co2 input method and a mad automatic irrigation function was used to explore the influences of future climate change on hydrology and corn yield in the u s high plains the differences among default constant and dynamic input methods under four gcms of cmip5 climate data for the rcp4 5 and 8 5 from 2031 to 2100 were investigated in this study the results found significantly greater simulated etc between the default input method and the other two input methods under the rcp4 5 scenario the rcp8 5 scenario also exhibited this difference along with statistically significant differences in etc simulations among each of the three input methods for the nebraska and kansas sites default constant dynamic furthermore etc and irrigation were both increased using the dynamic input method as opposed to the constant input method in the first half of the simulation period and decreased in the second half this is reasonable when considering that increased co2 concentrations induce the partial closing of corn stomata and reduction of etc and irrigation requirements in contrast simulated corn yield using the dynamic input method was reduced in the first half of the study period and greater in the second half of the period this highlighted the carbon fertilization effect on corn growth with gradual increases in co2 concentrations using the dynamic input method in the future these findings demonstrated the usefulness of the dynamic input method for swat to more representatively predict impact of future climate change the dynamic input method was further used to predict changes in hydrology and corn yields under a long term period from 2031 to 2298 as compared to the historical period of 1970 to 1999 the future period was divided into nine 30 year periods both etc and irrigation declined the most for the nebraska site with etc declining by an average of 2 9 rcp4 5 and 24 7 rcp8 5 over the entire study period p 0 05 and irrigation decreased by an average of 56 7 rcp4 5 and 96 0 rcp8 5 p 0 05 etc and irrigation were significantly less than the historical period for most of the time periods under the rcp8 5 scenario and etc for the texas site and irrigation at all three sites trended significantly downward under the rcp8 5 scenario the trendline of water yield was relatively stable over the entire simulation period but all scenarios and sites were significantly p 0 05 greater than that of the historical period corn yields at all three sites were significantly less than the historical period for different rcp scenarios and periods under the rcp8 5 scenario the trendline of corn yield decreased significantly in a logarithmic form with crop failure occurring at the end of the 23rd century the substantially elevated minimum air temperature with the logarithmic form was the major reason for the log decline in corn yield overall the results indicated that the future irrigation etc and corn yield could decrease at the three sites under different climate change scenarios and could be severe over time generally water yield was increased across different climatic locations under the various climate change scenarios thereby this study is informative and alarming for

2743,water resources in semi arid and arid regions are critical for sustainable agricultural development and climate change imposes great challenges and brings about large uncertainties in water resource management and crop production in this study the effects of future climate change on hydrology and corn production in the u s high plains region were assessed using a newly developed swat co2 model and gcms under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios specifically a new method to dynamically input annual co2 concentration into swat was developed this method along with the swat default co2 concentration 330 ppm and a constant co2 input option one average co2 concentration for a simulation period were compared for simulating hydrology and corn yield in 21st century 2031 2100 results showed the default co2 concentration continuously simulated the highest crop evapotranspiration etc and irrigation but the lowest water yield and corn yield among three methods especially under the rcp8 5 scenario however the etc and irrigation were higher for the dynamic input method before the mid 21st century and lower between mid to late 21st century than for the constant input method the contrast results were found for the corn yield simulations additionally the improved swat co2 model was applied to predict the changes in hydrology and corn yields for three centuries 2031 2298 relative to the historical period 1970 1999 results indicated that the overall trend of future irrigation etc and corn yield could decrease significantly at the three sites compared to the historical period the impacts of dramatically elevated co2 and logarithmic increase in air temperatures were the key factors for the above changes the study highlighted the necessity of considering the dynamic co2 input for the swat applications in climate change studies long term projected results of this study can inform local producers about the risks of future climate change in this water shortage environment keywords hydrological modeling swat co2 global climate change general circulation models gcms irrigated agriculture u s high plains data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the rapid development of modern societies along with an increased global population and economy have been fueled by a steady increase in the burning of fossil fuels for decades as a result climatic change has emerged due to the rising concentrations of greenhouse gases the most visible evidence of climate change is rising air temperatures which are closely associated with changes in the global water cycle el shehawy et al 2012 the 2015 paris agreement on climate change committed to limiting global average temperature increases to 2 c and pursuing efforts to achieve temperature increases of 1 5 c above pre industrial levels united nations framework convention on climate 2015 this agreement attempts to mitigate the overall impacts of climate change and reduce the occurrence of extreme events lewis et al 2019 therefore assessing the potential impacts of future climate change provide an invaluable and essential contribution to achieving carbon emission reductions for reducing global temperatures and associated negative impacts for the world qian et al 2021 simulation modeling has shown that climate change can have great impacts on hydrology and crop yields chen et al 2021 for instance it is predicted that by the end of 21st century climate change may result in a 16 3 reduction in global water use efficiency under a high emission scenario and a 2 2 reduction under a low emission scenario pan et al 2018 agriculture and climate change are inseparably linked and agricultural systems are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change factors related to agricultural production such as co2 concentration air temperature precipitation solar radiation and other factors are affected by climate change feng et al 2021 marras et al 2021 therefore global climate change is widely recognized as one of the most significant challenges faced by agriculture today it is necessary to explore the impact of climate change on the hydrologic cycle and crop production particularly across various climatic regions climate projections from the ipcc fifth assessment report ar5 were based on the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 which focused on representative concentration pathways rcps for future climate projections by various general circulation models gcms rogelj et al 2012 sheffield et al 2013 the gcm outputs of cmip5 have been widely used to study climate change related scenarios at regional and global scales zhang et al 2019 thus cmip5 projections could provide a good basis for the assessment of hydrological variables and crop growth parameters yuan et al 2020 the use of the watershed scale soil and water assessment tool swat facilitates the study of the impact of climate change on the regional water balance and crop production tan et al 2022 wang et al 2020 water resources are limited in the southwest united states u s and irrigated agriculture is a major economic contributor to the u s high plains region which relies heavily on the ogallala aquifer as an irrigation source rudnick et al 2019 corn zea mays l is one of the major field crops planted under irrigated conditions in the u s high plains national agricultural statistics service nass 2021 therefore three corn production sites in the u s high plains were selected for climate change evaluation in this study including fields in nebraska kansas and texas ranging from north to south representing different regional climates the existing method for simulating co2 concentration in swat is problematic in that it only allows for a static input value for co2 concentration that remains constant for the entire simulation period which has limitations for long term future climate change simulations in this study a dynamic co2 input method was developed to allow for varying annual co2 values in the swat model this development is both more flexible and realistic for long term continuous simulations and essential for assessing future climate change on water balance and crop growth tan et al 2020 wang et al 2017 such an approach is also more convenient and computationally efficient than splitting long term simulations into numerous smaller simulation scenarios it also likely allows for prediction results to be more representative and accurate in addition the previous studies of climate change lack long term simulations such as those from 2031 to 2300 in this study climate data from four gcms and two rcp scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 based on the cmip5 for three sites nebraska kansas and texas in the u s high plains were used to drive an improved swat model with the management allowed depletion mad auto irrigation algorithm and dynamic co2 input method an assessment was undertaken to determine the impact of projected future climate change on hydrology and corn yields in the u s high plains specifically the objectives of this study were to 1 develop a new method for dynamically inputting co2 annual concentrations into the swat model 2 compare the differences in the effects of three co2 input methods swat default co2 input 330 ppm constant co2 input one average value and dynamic co2 input on the hydrologic cycle and corn yields in the u s high plains during 2031 to 2100 and 3 assess the long term impacts of climate change on hydrology and corn yields across the u s high plains from 2031 to 2298 using the newly developed dynamic co2 input method compared with the historical period 1970 1999 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites three field study sites located in the u s high plains were chosen for use in this study their locations were north platte nebraska 41 2 n 100 9 w approximately 861 m above sea level garden city kansas 38 0 n 100 8 w approximately 887 m and bushland texas 35 2 n 102 1 w approximately 1171 m fig 1 all three study sites are classified as having a semi arid climate peel et al 2007 although air temperature and rainfall regimes vary the u s high plains area is the most important region for irrigated corn production in the nation the average annual precipitation for the nebraska site was 506 mm the mean annual maximum air temperature was 17 3 c and the minimum air temperature was 2 8 c the soil type at the nebraska site was classified as cozad silt loam soil survey staff 2010 the kansas site had an average annual precipitation of 439 mm an average annual maximum air temperature of 21 2 c and a minimum air temperature of 4 3 c the soil type was ulysses silt loam at the kansas site for the texas site the average annual precipitation was less than those for nebraska and kansas at 346 mm with average annual maximum and minimum air temperatures of 22 3 c and 3 7 c respectively the soil type at the texas site was pullman silt clay loam 2 2 cmip5 future climate data the cmip5 future climate data used in this study were downloaded from the c3s climate data store https cds climate copernicus eu cdsapp dataset projections cmip5 daily single

and mpl esm lr mpi germany the rcp4 5 scenario was a medium forcing scenario which had a stable radiative forcing of 4 5 w m 2 by 2100 and the rcp8 5 scenario was a high forcing scenario which had a stable radiative forcing of 8 5 w m 2 by 2100 van vuuren et al 2011 2 3 swat swat mad and swat co2 models 2 3 1 swat model the swat model is a continuous time semi distributed process based watershed scale model arnold et al 2012 it is a physically based hydrologic model that simulates crop growth hydrology and water quality its primary model components include a weather simulator hydrology plant growth and land management as well as loads and fluxes of sediment nutrients pesticides bacteria and pathogens the swat model is described in detail by neitsch et al 2011 the swat2012 revision 664 was used in this study the swat model simulates hydrological processes in the soil profile based on the water balance equation eq 1 including precipitation irrigation surface runoff evapotranspiration lateral flow and percolation arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 1 s w t s w o i 1 n r day i day q surf e t a q lat w seep where sw t is the final soil water content mm sw o is the initial soil water content mm t is the time step day r day is the amount of precipitation on day i or snowmelt mm i day is the amount of irrigation on day i mm q surf is the amount of surface runoff on day i mm et a is the amount of actual evapotranspiration on day i mm q lat is the amount of lateral flow on day i mm and w seep is the amount of percolation on day i mm the surface runoff is determined by a modified soil conservation service scs curve number method mishra and singh 2013 a kinematic storage model is used to calculate lateral flow sloan and moore 1984 a tipping bucket algorithm is used to simulate soil water flow arnold et al 2011 neitsch et al 2011 percolating water from the lowest soil layer enters the vadose zone and is ultimately recharged to the aquifer evapotranspiration for the swat model can be calculated by three different methods which include the penman monteith method monteith 1965 the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 and the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 the penman monteith method was used to simulate evapotranspiration in this study plant growth was modulated using heat unit theory according to plant specific input parameters which were summarized in the plant growth database neitsch et al 2011 swat first calculates potential growth using a leaf area index lai function determined by accumulated heat units light interception and converted intercepted light into biomass through radiation use efficiency actual growth is then calculated from the potential growth attributed to stresses such as extreme temperatures and deficiencies of water and nutrients i e nitrogen and phosphorus finally swat calculates crop yield as a portion of total biomass using harvest index and partitions a part of dry crop biomass as dry economic yield arnold et al 2011 cmip5 future climate data including daily precipitation and maximum minimum air temperatures were projected by four gcms in this study the wxgen weather generator model sharpley and williams 1990 which was embedded in the swat model was used to simulate future daily solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity for this weather generator model it was presumed that the signatures of solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity would remain consistent with current levels under different future scenarios which meant that precipitation and air temperatures were the major contributors to future hydrology and crop growth 2 3 2 swat management allowed depletion auto irrigation swat mad model in practice producers are willing to allow a maximum percentage of plant available water depletion before irrigation is triggered this concept is known as management allowed depletion mad a common framework for irrigation scheduling as outlined by merriam 1966 mad irrigation management has been widely applied in semi arid arid regions including texas kansas and nebraska in the u s callison 2012 evett et al 2011 payero et al 2008 for most crop production a 50 mad value represents a reasonable overall value for avoiding apparent crop water stress callison 2012 usda nrcs 2017 as for water sensitive crops or heavily compacted soils a smaller range of depletion may be needed 30 50 mad a larger mad value can be used 50 70 for stress tolerant crops or well structured soils the current default auto irrigation function in swat is unable to simulate mad irrigation management explicitly however irrigation scheduling based on the mad concept is becoming widely used marek et al 2011 evett et al 2011 as a result a mad based swat auto irrigation algorithm is required for accurate simulation of actual irrigation operations a mad based automatic irrigation algorithm based on a user defined permissible percentage of plant available water depletion determined by the maximum crop specific root depth and soil properties was developed for swat by chen et al 2018 mad values approaching zero denote irrigation management frequencies that result in low plant water stress conversely values approaching one result in irrigation management that leads to greater plant water stress as expressed in eq 2 2 s o l s u m f c s o l s w p a w m a d where sol sumfc is the amount of water held in the soil profile at field capacity mm sol sw is the amount of water stored in soil profile on any given day mm paw is plant available water determined primarily by soil texture and plant specific maximum rooting depth and mad is the management allowed depletion percentage user defined water stress threshold that triggers irrigation expressed as a decimal value ranging from 0 to 1 2 3 3 swat co2 dynamic input method co2 concentration is very important for swat model simulations swat adjusts crop radiation use efficiency rue according to different values of atmospheric co2 concentrations so as to change both the conversion efficiency of crop photosynthesis and the accumulation of crop biomass however the swat default co2 concentration is set to 330 ppm the default value can be changed by swat users but remains fixed at that value for the duration of the simulation as such different co2 concentrations cannot be assigned for different years within a single simulation which prevents simulation of increasing co2 concentrations over time in long term simulations this condition represents a critical deficiency in swat as co2 concentrations increase gradually over time under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios to overcome this problem some scholars have modified the maximum stomatal conductance of crops to reflect the impact of co2 concentration changes on crops wu et al 2012a 2012b butcher et al 2014 chen et al 2019 compensated for the low default co2 concentrations in future climate scenarios by dividing the simulation duration into multiple time periods and inputting the average co2 concentrations for the future climate simulation periods furthermore some scholars modified the swat subroutine to output co2 and consider the dynamics of co2 emissions melaku et al 2022 qi et al 2020 however the above methods cannot fundamentally solve the problem of using dynamic co2 concentration in swat and associated simulation results likely include intrinsic errors not easily discerned therefore the development of dynamic co2 input method is both necessary and timely given current international interest in climate change simulation in this study a dynamic co2 input method was developed to incorporate projected ipcc annual co2 concentration data as input data for the swat model thus allowing for simulations using changing annual co2 concentrations in this study we created an input text file named co2con with annual co2 concentrations derived from ipcc a subroutine readco2 f was developed to read annual co2 concentration values in co2con file for dynamic co2 simulations specifically a global variable co2con was defined and used to receive the co2 concentration of current simulation year and then used in hru level subroutines the escalated co2 concentrations influenced the plant canopy resistance eqs 3 and 4 which further altered the potential evapotranspiration pet calculation furthermore radiation use efficiency was also adjusted by elevated co2 concentrations eq 5 given as 3 r c 0 5 g l co 2 l a i 1 4 g l co 2 g l 1 4 0 4 co 2 330 where r c is the plant canopy resistance m s 1 g l is the maximum conductance of a single leaf m s 1 lai is the leaf area index of the canopy g l co 2 is the leaf conductance modified to reflect co2 effects m s 1 and co 2 is the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere ppm 5 rue 100 co 2 co 2 e x p r 1 r 2 co 2 where rue is the radiation use efficiency which was defined as dry biomass generated for each unit of intercepted solar radiation kg ha mj m2 1 and r 1 and r 2 are shape coefficients 2 4 model setup and evaluation the daily meteorological data for nebraska kansas and texas sites were obtained from the high plains regional climate center hprcc weather network https hprcc unl edu including precipitation and maximum minimum air temperatures measured hydrologic and agronomic data for the texas site in 2013 and 2016 included lysimeter measured daily crop evapotranspiration etc actual irrigation lai and aboveground biomass for corn whereas only actual irrigation data were collected for the nebraska and kansas sites chen et al 2019a the swat mad simulated irrigation was compared to actual irrigation at all three study sites for model evaluation evaluation was performed at the hydrological response unit hru level with measured daily etc lai and aboveground biomass for texas site evaluation of irrigation using the swat mad model was conducted for all three sites the calibrated parameters for texas from 2000 to 2010 were obtained from chen et al 2018 while nebraska and kansas sites used a parameter regionalization calibration method chen et al 2019a swat mad performance for simulated irrigation was analyzed using percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 coefficient of determination r2 legates and mccabe 1999 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 statistics 2 5 scenario design 2 5 1 three co2 input methods for 2031 2100 to better represent the impacts of co2 concentrations in model simulations of major hydrologic variables and crop yield under future climate change scenarios three different methods for simulating co2 concentration were used 1 the swat default value of 330 ppm 2 a constant value of 506 or 661 ppm calculated as the average concentration over the simulation period of 2031 2100 using the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively and 3 the dynamic co2 input method introduced in this study which used different concentration values for each year table 1 these co2 concentration simulation approaches were termed the default input constant input and dynamic input methods 2 5 2 study periods 1970 1999 and 2031 2298 the historical period of 1970 1999 was used as the baseline scenario future climate change simulations considered the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios based on four gcms from cmip5 the future climate projections 2031 2298 were divided into nine 30 year periods 2031 2060 2061 2090 2091 2120 2121 2150 2151 2180 2181 2210 2211 2240 2241 2270 and 2271 2298 the first five years of data e g 2026 2030 before the start of each period e g 2031 2060 were used for the swat model warmup the dynamic co2 input method was used in this long term simulation table 1 2 6 statistical analysis to compare the differences between the three co2 input methods from 2031 to 2100 for hydrology and corn yield at the three sites of nebraska kansas and texas the one way anova method was used to determine significant differences in the means of multiple samples under the influence of a single control variable samples having significant differences p 0 05 were indicated using letter designations e g a b and c in addition a linear fit method was used to test the significance of the long term trends for 2031 2100 and 2031 2298 the t test student s t test was used to test the significance level for the ensemble mean of four gcms from 2031 to 2298 i e nine 30 year time periods with respect to the historical period a nonparametric test namely wilcoxon s rank sum test a rank based reciprocity test was used for data that were not normally distributed 3 results 3 1 model performance evaluation the model performance demonstrated satisfactory agreement between simulated and observed etc lai and aboveground biomass for the texas site the nse r2 and pbias values for daily etc were 0 75 0 81 and 11 7 for the 2013 and 2016 simulation periods respectively table 2 lai matched well with observed data with nse r2 and pbias values of 0 86 0 88 and 5 9 respectively the simulated and observed values of aboveground biomass also agreed well with nse r2 and pbias of 0 84 0 86 and 5 3 respectively table 2 the nse r2 and pbias values for the swat mad simulated monthly irrigation amount at the texas site were 0 81 0 83 and 0 4 respectively table 2 compared to the actual irrigation amounts the swat mad simulated monthly irrigation amounts for the kansas site had nse r2 and pbias values of 0 70 0 71 and 16 4 respectively from 2005 to 2012 for the nebraska site the nse r2 and pbias were 0 56 0 56 and 3 9 respectively using the swat mad model for monthly irrigation amounts from 2003 to 2006 table 2 the results indicated a satisfactory model performance for all three sites 3 2 comparisons of simulated etc irrigation water yield and corn yield using three co2 input methods 3 2 1 difference in simulated etc under the rcp4 5 scenario the default co2 input method simulated the greatest etc across locations from 2031 to 2100 p 0 05 while there was no significant difference in etc simulations using the constant and dynamic input methods across the three sites table 3 furthermore the default and constant input methods indicated a significant increasing trend in simulated etc from 2031 to 2100 under the rcp4 5 scenario fig 2 a1 a3 whereas the dynamic input method did not show a marked trend fig 2a1 a3 it is worth noting that the margin of difference for the simulated etc between the default input method and the other two input methods tended to increase with the decreasing latitude at the three sites table 3 fig 2a1 a3 similar to the rcp4 5 scenario the default method predicted the greatest etc among the three input methods under the rcp8 5 scenario table 3 fig 3 a1 a3 and there was a significant increasing trend greater slope than rcp4 5 for both the default and constant input methods from 2031 to 2100 contrary to the rcp4 5 scenario predicted etc for the dynamic input method showed a significant decreasing trend fig 3a1 a3 while the simulated etc using the dynamic input method was greater than that of the constant input method before 2065 and less than that of the constant input after 2076 for the nebraska and kansas sites the predicted average etc among the three methods all showed significant differences table 3 similar to the rcp4 5 scenario the difference in simulated etc among the three methods became more pronounced in the lower latitudes figs 2 and 3 3 2 2 comparison of simulated irrigation similar to the etc results the default co2 input method also simulated the greatest amount of irrigation relative to the other two input methods under the rcp4 5 scenario p 0 05 table 3 fig 2b1 b3 however there were no significant differential trends over time using different input methods across the three sites fig 2b1 b3 in general the average irrigation was larger for the kansas ranging from 100 0 to 119 8 mm and texas ranging from 64 7 to 92 5 mm sites as compared to the nebraska site ranging from 13 6 to 22 6 mm table 3 for the rcp8 5 scenario predicted average irrigation using the default input method was significantly greater than values for the constant and dynamic input methods table 3 moreover predicted irrigation showed a significant upward trend from 2031 to 2100 under the default and constant input methods at all three sites whereas there were significant decreasing trends for the kansas and texas sites using the dynamic input method fig 3b1 b3 3 2 3 influence on water yield by three co2 input methods under the rcp4 5 scenario the average annual water yield for the constant and dynamic input methods were significantly greater p 0 05 than the default input method table 3 fig 2c1 c3 across three sites table 3 no significant differential trend from 2031 to 2100 was found for predicted water yield using the three input methods across the three sites fig 2c1 c3 water yield decreased with decreasing latitude for all three co2 input methods table 3 fig 2c1 c3 under the rcp8 5 scenario average annual water yield simulated by the default input method remained significantly less than the other two methods across locations table 3 unlike the rcp4 5 scenario the trendline in water yield increased significantly using the dynamic method for the nebraska site fig 3c1 and for the kansas and texas sites the trendlines decreased significantly with the default and constant input methods fig 3c2 and c3 3 2 4 impact on corn yield using three input methods the constant and dynamic input methods showed no significant difference for corn yield but their predictions were significantly greater p 0 05 than the default input method under the rcp4 5 scenario table 3 fig 2d1 d3 furthermore the trendlines for all three methods were significantly decreased at all sites fig 2d1 d3 and the yield gap between the constant dynamic input methods and the default input method increased with the decreasing latitudes under the rcp8 5 scenario predicted average corn yields were lowest using the default input method table 3 fig 3d1 d3 simulated yields using the dynamic input were less than those using the constant input in the first half of the study period 2031 to mid 21st century for the texas site and greater for those in the later part late mid 21st century to 2100 fig 3d3 this can be explained by the co2 fertilizer effect when a dynamic increase in co2 concentration was simulated using the dynamic co2 input method predicted corn yield showed a significant declining trend for all three input methods across all three sites figs 2 and 3d1 d3 3 3 projected future climate from 2031 to 2298 3 3 1 projected precipitation for all three sites average annual precipitation increased significantly p 0 05 over nine 30 year periods from 2031 to 2298 as compared to the historical period 1970 1999 under both the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios except for 2081 2210 of rcp8 5 for the texas site fig 4 on average from 2031 to 2298 precipitation increased significantly by 42 5 and 40 9 for the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios in the nebraska site 41 0 and 28 7 in the kansas site and 36 9 and 18 1 in the texas site respectively compared to the historical period fig 4 simultaneously there were significant increasing trends in the simulated precipitation over time for the nebraska site in both rcp scenarios and for the texas site using the rcp8 5 scenario fig 4a and c the precipitation anomalies were obviously increased for the texas site with the greatest percentage change anomaly of nearly 300 between 2121 and 2150 for the rcp4 5 scenario fig 4c 3 3 2 projected maximum and minimum air temperatures maximum and minimum air temperatures increased significantly p 0 05 over the nine 30 year periods compared to the historical period under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios in three sites fig 5 both maximum and minimum air temperatures showed significant increasing trends from 2031 to 2298 under both rcp scenarios with a logarithmic form for the rcp8 5 scenario fig 5 under the rcp4 5 scenario the mean values of maximum air temperature during the entire study period 2031 2298 increased by 1 30 c 2 07 c and 2 09 c relative to the historical period for the nebraska kansas and texas sites respectively under the rcp8 5 scenario the average maximum air temperature increases were greater as compared to the rcp4 5 scenario gradually increasing with decreasing latitude with 7 43 c 8 39 c and 8 56 c from north to south for the three sites fig 5 it is worth noting that the increase in the minimum air temperature was much greater than that of the maximum air temperature fig 6 with the entire period under the rcp4 5 scenario significantly increased by approximately 6 c the average increases were 6 05 c 6 78 c and 6 58 c for the nebraska kansas and texas sites in addition minimum air temperature increased significantly by approximately 5 c during the initial study period 2031 2060 and by approximately 17 c at the end of the 23rd century 2271 2298 for all three sites under the rcp8 5 scenario 3 4 long term climate change impacts on etc irrigation water yield and crop yield using the dynamic co2 input method for three centuries 3 4 1 changes in etc for the nebraska site etc was significantly less p 0 05 than the historical period from the 21st century to the first half of the 23rd century 2031 to 2240 under the rcp4 5 scenario fig 7 a with an average decrease of 2 9 over the entire period 2031 to 2298 although predicted etc was lower relative to the historical period for most 30 year periods the trend increased significantly from 2031 to 2298 for the rcp8 5 scenario etc was significantly lower than the historical period for all nine 30 year periods fig 7a the average percentage decrease in etc was 24 7 over the entire study period for the rcp8 5 scenario fig 7a for the kansas site a significant increase was found for etc from 2031 to 2060 and from 2121 to 2210 under the rcp4 5 scenario and a significant decrease for the periods of 2061 2298 were identified under the rcp8 5 scenario compared to the historical period the mean values of percent change in etc were 2 5 and 19 0 for the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios p 0 05 no significant differential trend of etc for the kansas site was determined under either rcp scenario fig 7b for the texas site etc increased significantly from 2031 to 2120 and from 2241 to 2298 as compared to the historical period with a significant average increase of 3 5 for the entire period under the rcp4 5 scenario the average percent decrease in etc was approximately 24 0 from 2031 to 2298 p 0 05 with a significant declining trend over time under the rcp8 5 scenario fig 7c 3 4 2 variations in irrigation in general average annual irrigation for most future periods was predicted to be less than that of the historical period under the rcp4 5 scenario with an average decrease of 56 7 20 3 and 56 7 from 2031 to 2298 for sites in nebraska kansas and texas respectively fig 8 however the trend in irrigation varied across the three sites with the nebraska site having an increasing trend and the texas site having a decreasing trend over time p 0 05 for the rcp8 5 scenario predicted irrigation was significantly lower than the historical period with an average percentage decrease of 96 0 63 9 and 87 3 for sites in nebraska kansas and texas respectively and all had a significant decreasing trend in irrigation fig 8 note that in the nebraska and texas sites there was virtually no simulated irrigation between 2091 and 2298 3 4 3 water yield dynamics for the nebraska and texas sites water yield was significantly increased p 0 05 for nine 30 year periods as compared to the historical period under both rcp scenarios fig 9 a and c an average of 242 4 and 365 0 mm for rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively was found for the nebraska site and 569 5 and 855 7 mm for the texas site p 0 05 the water yield for the kansas site also increased significantly under both rcp scenarios however the water yield increase in the kansas site was markedly less than those for the nebraska and texas sites averaging 30 4 and 32 7 mm for the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively the changing trend over time in water yield of all sites was not significant except for the nebraska site under the rcp8 5 scenario p 0 05 fig 9 3 4 4 corn yield response overall predicted average crop yield for the nine 30 year periods was less than the historical period for all three sites under both rcp scenarios p 0 05 fig 10 average reductions over the entire study period of 27 3 and 63 7 for the rcp4 5 and 8 5 respectively were found for the nebraska site 30 8 and 68 2 for the kansas site and 22 5 and 62 3 for the texas site the overall trend in yield over time under the rcp4 5 scenario was relatively stable for the nebraska and kansas sites and increased significantly for the texas site however under the rcp8 5 scenario the trend in yield significantly decreased in a logarithmic form across all sites fig 10 3 5 regional differences in simulated etc irrigation water yield and crop yield using dynamic input method across various climatic locations for the rcp4 5 scenario there was a significant difference p 0 05 in the average etc from 2031 to 2298 across locations with etc values of approximately 509 9 mm 605 5 mm and 587 4 mm from north to south table 4 the average amounts of irrigation significantly differed among the three sites and the future irrigation requirement for corn production was greatest for the kansas site at approximately 98 6 mm water yield decreased significantly with decreasing latitudes for the nebraska kansas and texas sites by approximately 198 1 mm 172 5 mm and 78 4 mm respectively this demonstrated that nebraska was more vulnerable to the risk of runoff in the future however corn yield was greater for the nebraska site at approximately 7 6 mg ha 1 and significantly larger than the texas site table 4 under the rcp8 5 scenario the regional variations in simulated mean values of etc and irrigation were similar to that of the rcp4 5 scenario table 4 both etc and irrigation were greatest p 0 05 for the kansas site with 478 5 and 44 7 mm respectively and lowest for the nebraska site p 0 05 table 4 mean values of water yield decreased significantly from north to south with 289 8 186 4 and 115 9 mm for the nebraska kansas and texas sites respectively nevertheless the simulated mean values of corn yield for the nebraska site were numerically greater than those for the kansas site but no significant difference was found between the two sites yield for the texas site was significantly less than the other two sites and was approximately 3 3 mg ha 1 thus indicating a noticeable food security issue in texas in the future table 4 4 discussion 4 1 effects of co2 input methods on hydrology and crop yield when using the swat model to predict and analyze the effects of future climate change on hydrology and crop growth the co2 input in the model was an important influencing factor the lack of an option for dynamic input of co2 concentrations in the current swat model limited its efficacy for assessing the impacts of future climate change gao et al 2020 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 therefore this study developed and incorporated a dynamic co2 input method into swat and compared the differences of major hydrologic variables and corn yields by applying three different co2 input methods from 2031 to 2100 among the three input methods the default input method simulated the highest etc and irrigation continuously but simulated the least water yield and corn yield figs 2 and 3 furthermore the simulated etc and irrigation using the dynamic input method were greater than those of the constant input method in the first half of the simulation period and lower in the later period which highlighted the importance of considering the rising co2 levels in the future for water cycling in contrast the simulated corn yields using the dynamic input method were less than those using the constant input method in the first half period and greater than those of the constant input method in the second half period generally similar results were more evident under the rcp8 5 scenario these findings emphasized the positive effect of co2 on crop yield boost it is notable that under the rcp8 5 scenario the simulated yield for the texas site was greater for the constant input method relative to the dynamic input method at the beginning of the 21st century however by the end of the 21st century greater yield values were simulated by the dynamic input approach even though the difference was reduced when compared to the constant input method fig 3 this could be explained by the fact that at the beginning of the 21st century the increase in air temperature was relatively smaller compared to the historical period and there was less temperature stress for corn growth yields at this stage were likely more sensitive to the co2 fertilizer effect however there was a considerable increase in both maximum and minimum air temperatures over time under the rcp8 5 scenario the limiting effect of temperature stress on corn far exceeded the extent to which yield was positively affected by the elevated co2 concentrations at the end of the 21st century this also explains why corn yields differed less between the dynamic and constant input methods later in the study period furthermore the logarithmic rise in air temperatures and logarithmic drop in yields provided evidence for the above explanations figs 5 6 and 10 both the constant and dynamic input methods differed significantly from the default input method in simulating hydrologic and yield factors therefore this new method for dynamic co2 inputs was necessary for reducing the uncertainty in predicting future climate change impacts compared to previous swat studies of no change or using a single input co2 value 4 2 exploring the causes of future climate change on hydrology and corn yields in this study future etc irrigation and corn yield using the newly developed dynamic input method were predicted to decrease for the nebraska kansas and texas sites with increasing water yield especially in the rcp8 5 scenario under the future climate scenarios the decreases in etc and irrigation were mainly due to the closure of crop stomata and suppression of transpiration caused by the elevated co2 concentrations bunce and nasyrov 2012 for example liu et al 2021 found that stomatal closure and decreased stomatal conductivity negatively affected corn evapotranspiration through a two year field experiment in northeast china this study showed that changes in future corn yield vary distinctively with geographic locations such as with the nebraska kansas and texas sites from the north to south which were sequentially lower in latitude by 3 and spanned different climatic locations this is consistent with other studies showing that spatial and geographic variations could affect crop yields asseng et al 2019 fletcher et al 2020 shin et al 2017 under both the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios corn yield was greater for the nebraska site and significantly larger than the texas site p 0 05 not only under the future climate but during the historical period corn yields from nebraska were greater than those in kansas and texas which also had lower yields and large yield gaps kucharik et al 2020 nebraska is abundant in precipitation during the corn growing season with greater humidity which has a positive impact on corn yields in contrast kansas and texas are located in the middle and south of the u s high plains and often experience extreme climate conditions such as high temperatures and drought which are the main reasons for lower corn yields in both regions kucharik et al 2020 this study predicted reductions in corn yields from the 21st century to the 23rd century under both the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios particularly rcp8 5 suggested crop yield reductions of more than 80 by the end of the 23rd century as compared to the historical period many studies have evaluated the impact of climate change on global agricultural systems under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios and found that crop yields were highly vulnerable to future climate change ketiem et al 2017 leng 2018 tan et al 2022 wang et al 2018 the warming climate can negatively affect corn yield which is mainly due to greater air temperatures that increase the rate of development and maturation and shorten the growing period of corn bassu et al 2014 chen et al 2019b wechsung et al 2021 in this study the simulated reduction in corn yield was associated with a considerable increase in future air temperatures at the study sites the similar trend of logarithmic increase in air temperatures and logarithmic decrease in yield under the rcp8 5 scenario in this study provided further evidence figs 5 6 and 10 few studies have projected climate change impacts on hydrology and crop yield for the next three centuries due to the higher uncertainty associated with longer projections however this study is a worthy undertaking to provide valuable insights into long term climate change impacts on water resources and agriculture sustainability using the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios to constrain projections this study offers possible ranges of what can happen in the future with different feasible mitigation efforts 5 conclusions an improved swat model equipped with a dynamic co2 input method and a mad automatic irrigation function was used to explore the influences of future climate change on hydrology and corn yield in the u s high plains the differences among default constant and dynamic input methods under four gcms of cmip5 climate data for the rcp4 5 and 8 5 from 2031 to 2100 were investigated in this study the results found significantly greater simulated etc between the default input method and the other two input methods under the rcp4 5 scenario the rcp8 5 scenario also exhibited this difference along with statistically significant differences in etc simulations among each of the three input methods for the nebraska and kansas sites default constant dynamic furthermore etc and irrigation were both increased using the dynamic input method as opposed to the constant input method in the first half of the simulation period and decreased in the second half this is reasonable when considering that increased co2 concentrations induce the partial closing of corn stomata and reduction of etc and irrigation requirements in contrast simulated corn yield using the dynamic input method was reduced in the first half of the study period and greater in the second half of the period this highlighted the carbon fertilization effect on corn growth with gradual increases in co2 concentrations using the dynamic input method in the future these findings demonstrated the usefulness of the dynamic input method for swat to more representatively predict impact of future climate change the dynamic input method was further used to predict changes in hydrology and corn yields under a long term period from 2031 to 2298 as compared to the historical period of 1970 to 1999 the future period was divided into nine 30 year periods both etc and irrigation declined the most for the nebraska site with etc declining by an average of 2 9 rcp4 5 and 24 7 rcp8 5 over the entire study period p 0 05 and irrigation decreased by an average of 56 7 rcp4 5 and 96 0 rcp8 5 p 0 05 etc and irrigation were significantly less than the historical period for most of the time periods under the rcp8 5 scenario and etc for the texas site and irrigation at all three sites trended significantly downward under the rcp8 5 scenario the trendline of water yield was relatively stable over the entire simulation period but all scenarios and sites were significantly p 0 05 greater than that of the historical period corn yields at all three sites were significantly less than the historical period for different rcp scenarios and periods under the rcp8 5 scenario the trendline of corn yield decreased significantly in a logarithmic form with crop failure occurring at the end of the 23rd century the substantially elevated minimum air temperature with the logarithmic form was the major reason for the log decline in corn yield overall the results indicated that the future irrigation etc and corn yield could decrease at the three sites under different climate change scenarios and could be severe over time generally water yield was increased across different climatic locations under the various climate change scenarios thereby this study is informative and alarming for

2744,concurrent heatwaves and droughts that occur over northeastern china nec bring severe threats to human lives and crop production despite the great efforts taken in previous studies realistic prediction of these concurrent extreme events remains a challenge in the present study a probability based index that simultaneously considers precipitation deficiency and high temperature is calculated to represent concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over nec based on this index the characteristics of concurrent heatwaves and droughts over nec in july august are investigated using the year to year increment approach the results indicate that the occurrence of concurrent heatwaves and droughts over nec is closely related to the polar eurasian teleconnection pattern and the pacific japan teleconnection pattern further analyses indicate that the sea ice content in the barents sea in march sicbs the la niña like sea surface temperature sst in february sst pc1 and the northwestern siberia soil moisture in april sm are coincidently linked to the two teleconnection patterns mentioned above based on their corresponding physical mechanisms these three independent predictors are chosen to construct a physical empirical prediction model for the prediction of concurrent heatwaves and droughts over nec results suggest that this physical empirical prediction model performs well with a high correlation coefficient and a low root mean squared error between the observed and predicted concurrent heatwaves and droughts over nec during the period of 1979 2018 moreover the cross validation test and independent hindcasts both suggest that the physical empirical model proposed in the present study with the three independent predictors has good prediction skills keywords concurrent heatwaves and droughts northeastern china mechanisms physical empirical prediction model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction northeastern china is the granary of china where crop production is sensitive to climate conditions concurrent heatwaves and droughts are particularly threatening to crop production in this region li et al 2018a compared to traditional drought events the concurrent heatwaves and droughts would be more disastrous for human lives and crop production recently the northeastern china experienced severe concurrent heatwaves and droughts which led to significant production risks li et al 2018a for example soybean and maize production decreased by 30 due to the concurrent heatwave and drought that occurred in northeastern china in 2018 https www tianqi com news 226592 html in the context of global warming the concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china became more severe and occurred more frequently in the past decades li et al 2015 which may be regulated by both internal variabilities of the climate system li et al 2018a li et al 2020a and human activities li et al 2020b most of the previous studies only focused on the mechanisms and prediction of traditional extreme events that are solely dependent on a single variable han et al 2017 sun et al 2017 han et al 2020 whereas the concurrent heatwaves and droughts may bring severe disasters and deserve more attention recently few studies simultaneously considered precipitation deficiency and high temperature to investigate concurrent heatwaves and droughts li et al 2018a li et al 2020a li et al 2020b given the importance to improve the prediction skills for concurrent heatwaves and droughts it is of great significance to investigate the physical mechanisms and improve the seasonal prediction of concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china recently possible physical mechanisms for the concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china were investigated by li et al 2018a results indicated that the variation of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china may be largely influenced by the variation of spring sea ice content over the barents sea on the interannual timescale li et al 2018a however this study mainly focused on the variation of sea ice in march while other internal variabilities of the climate system were not deeply investigated in addition to sea ice a previous study found that some other factors in the high latitudes and mid to low latitudes may also influence climate conditions across china jian et al 2020 for example the snow cover and soil moisture over eurasia may modulate atmospheric teleconnection patterns and climate conditions across china barnett et al 1988 zhang and zuo 2011 li and wang 2014 zhang et al 2016 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 besides many studies also found that the low latitude sst could regulate the distribution of rain belts over eastern china via air sea interaction processes wu et al 2003 feng and hu 2004 liu et al 2019 sun et al 2019 besides the atlantic multidecadal oscillation and human activities may influence the variations of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china on the interdecadal li et al 2020a and long trend li et al 2020b time scales hence further in depth studies are necessary to explore possible influences of the internal variabilities of the climate system in high latitudes and mid to low latitudes on the concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china various approaches include dynamical models kang et al 2004 chen and sun 2020 ren and nie 2021 and physical empirical prediction models have been used to predict climatic events a physical empirical model refers to an empirical prediction model established based on understanding of the physical mechanisms linking the predictors e g

al 2015 luo and wang 2018 chen and sun 2020 hadipour et al 2020 the linear regression method is commonly used to construct the physical empirical prediction models fan and tian 2013 ji and fan 2019 currently the overall performance of dynamic models in the prediction of extreme events across china remains poor ma et al 2015 for this reason various downscaling methods dai and fan 2021 and physical empirical prediction models xiao and wang 2017 have been proposed some studies fan et al 2008 fan and wang 2010 zhu 2011 predicted climate conditions using the year to year increment dy approach proposed by fan et al 2008 traditionally the investigation and prediction of extreme climate only focus on unique events for example snow activity fan and tian 2013 dust events ji and fan 2019 extreme precipitation events tian and fan 2020 han et al 2020 sea surface temperature chen and sun 2020 and air temperature fan and wang 2010 ma et al 2015 etc few studies consider compound extreme events e g concurrent heatwaves and droughts recently several models for the prediction of precipitation ma and sun 2021 and hot days zhang et al 2019 over northeastern china were constructed nevertheless studies on the prediction of concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china are quite limited whether the physical empirical prediction model can well predict the concurrent events over northeastern china remains unknown therefore the main purpose of this study is to reveal the physical mechanisms for concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china influences from high latitudes and mid to low latitudes are considered based on the physical mechanisms and the year to year increment method a physical empirical model for the prediction of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china is proposed with the hope to improve the prediction of the aforementioned concurrent events this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the datasets and the methods used in the present study with ncar command language matlab cdo and r software implemented in this research section 3 briefly illustrates the spatial temporal characteristics of the concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china and corresponding atmospheric circulations the three predictors and possible physical mechanisms for the concurrent heatwaves and droughts are analyzed in section 4 in section 5 the physical empirical prediction model and its validation for the prediction of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china are described conclusions and discussions are given in section 6 2 data and methods 2 1 data the gridded monthly precipitation and surface air temperature observational datasets hereafter referred to as cn05 1 for the period 1961 2018 are used in this study the cn05 1 data was developed by wu and gao 2013 based on observations at 2416 stations across china using the anomaly interpolation method where the climatology field is interpolated first followed by the interpolation of the anomaly field and finally the two are combined new et al 2000 to obtain a fine gridded dataset the cn05 1 data has been widely used in numerous studies on climate variation in china which has been demonstrated to be capable to well reflects the variation of climate anomalies over china ma et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 li et al 2018b li et al 2020b zhu et al 2020 zhu et al 2022 the spatial resolution of cn05 1 is 1 1 the monthly global necp ncar reanalysis dataset with a spatial resolution of 2 5 2 5 is employed in this study kalnay et al 1996 which is interpolated onto a 1 1 grid using the bilinear interpolation method provided by the climate data operators cdo geopotential height meridional and zonal winds 0 10 cm soil moisture air temperature specific humidity and vertical velocity are extracted from the ncep ncar reanalysis data for the present study monthly sea ice concentration sic and sea surface temperature sst are obtained from the hadley centre sea ice and sst dataset version 1 which has a horizontal resolution of 1 1 rayner 2003 besides the era5 reanalysis datasets with a spatial resolution of 1 1 are also employed in this study https cds climate copernicus eu geopotential height meridional and zonal winds volumetric soil water layer 1 air temperature specific humidity vertical velocity sic and sst are extracted from the era5 reanalysis data for the present study 2 2 methods concurrent heatwaves and droughts are expected to increase under a warming climate aghakouchak et al 2020 for example the concurrent heatwave and droughts that occurred in california in 2014 led to a significant water crisis with record low storage levels and severe wildfires aghakouchak et al 2014a aghakouchak et al 2014b therefore the concurrent heatwave and drought event is defined by a probability based index pi which is calculated using the joint cumulative distribution of precipitation x 1 and temperature x 2 temporal series over northeastern china traditionally the cumulative distribution function cdf of precipitation and temperature is expressed as f 1 x 1 p x 1 x 1 and f 2 x 2 p x 2 x 2 respectively the joint survival function f i can be used to identify the concurrent heatwave and drought which is defined as f i 1 f i different copula families t copula gaussian copula gumbel copula etc are employed to construct joint distribution in this study and the goodness of fit is implemented based on empirical copula process kojadinovic and yan 2011 which is a nonparametric rank based estimator of the true copula here the empirical copula is classically defined as the empirical cdf computed from the pseudo observations if we expected that the null hypothesis is accepted at the 95 confidence level significance level of 0 05 p value should be larger than 0 05 and a larger p value represents a better fit kojadinovic and yan 2010 results suggest that the t copula fits best with an acceptable p value 0 655 indicating a representative fit at 95 confidence kojadinovic and yan 2010 in this method precipitation deficiency is defined by precipitation anomaly x 1 smaller than a certain anomaly threshold x 1 where x 1 x 1 similarly high temperature is defined by temperature anomaly x 2 larger than a certain anomaly threshold x 2 where x 2 x 2 here the precipitation anomaly temperature anomaly is calculated by taking the difference between the july august mean precipitation temperature value in the current year and the climatological mean of the july august precipitation temperature for the years 1979 2018 in particular for the sake of the multivariate copula method the x 1 and x 1 are multiplied by 1 where x 1 x 1 1 x 1 x 1 1 and hence x 1 x 1 consequently the joint survival cdf is calculated by pi f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 p x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 which reflects how extreme the event is based on the joint survival cdf the survival layer l t f is calculated as l t f x r d f x t where t is a probability level the survival kendall s return period κ x is defined as κ x μ 1 k t where μ is the recurrence interval and k t is the survival function associated that calculated as k t p f x 1 x 2 t p p i t salvadori et al 2013 given a particular level of return period t the survival layer l t f is estimated as q q p k 1 p at the probability level p p 1 μ t where q is the survival kendall s quantile of order p generally most observed concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china are concentrated in july august li et al 2018a and the spatial temporal characteristics of pi in june are noticeably different from that in july august figure s1 therefore pi is calculated using monthly mean data of precipitation and temperature in july august on a grid cell basis where pi varies between zero and unity the pinec index is defined as the regionally averaged standardized pi over northeastern china 110 e 135 e 42 n 55 n the red rectangle in fig 2 a and a negative pinec with a larger absolute value corresponds to a higher return period event of heatwave and drought over northeastern china li et al 2018a li et al 2020a where a higher return period event refers to a more extreme event for example northeastern china experienced a severe concurrent heatwave and drought event during july august in 2016 the precipitation anomaly was 104 3 mm and the temperature anomaly was 1 8 c fig 1 based on this method the original series of pi was the second lowest value to be 0 06 figure s2 and the return period ranked the second highest value during the past 60 years about 30 years fig 1 suggesting a severe concurrent heatwave and drought event the year to year increment dy approach is used to build the physical empirical prediction model in this study dy is defined as the difference of a variable between the current year and the preceding year fan et al 2008 for example d p i 2018 p i 2018 p i 2017 based on the method the predicted variable is calculated by adding the predicted dy value to the preceding year s value for example the predicted pi current year the predicted dpi the observed pi preceding year generally the precipitation and temperature in summer exhibit quasi biennial oscillation qbo characteristics in the east asian region chen et al 2006 considering the influence of qbo on climate systems the anomalies of pi in the current year δ pi i and in the preceding year δ p i i 1 can be represented as δ pi i pi i pi x δ i and δ p i i 1 pi i 1 pi x δ i 1 respectively here δ i 1 and δ i are disturbances of x and can be ignored when compared with x as a result δ pi i x and the dy of pi can be calculated as d p i pi i pi i 1 δ pi i δ p i i 1 2 x the year to year increment anomaly d p i is approximately twice as the δ pi i where δ pi i is a traditional predictant in the prediction approach hence the prediction signals are amplified by the dy prediction approach which has been widely used since it may significantly improve the prediction ability fan et al 2008 fan and wang 2010 besides qian et al 2018 indicated that the dy method is suitable to consider non gaussian extreme variables and the urbanized effect given the advantages of the year to year approach the dy method is employed to predict the concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china based on the physical mechanisms the explanations of physical mechanisms are given in section 4 the multiple linear regression model of dpi is constructed and the dpi is predicted as d p i i a 0 j 1 n a j predictor j i where a 0 and a j are regression coefficients i is the certain year and n denotes the total number of predictors then the predicted dpi is added to the preceding year s observed pi to calculate the predicted pi e g p i p r e d i c t e d 2018 d p i p r e d i c t e d 2018 p i o b s e r v e d 2017 besides the cross validation method and the independent hindcast are used to estimate the skill of the physical empirical prediction model the cross validation method systematically deletes one year s value and constructs a physical empirical prediction model based on the multiple linear regression method the independent hindcasts for dpi and pinec during 1999 2018 are also constructed while a model is established on a time series from 1961 to the year before the target year then the final pinec is calculated by adding the predicted dpi to the observed pinec from the preceding year four statistical measures are employed to evaluate the performance of the physical empirical prediction model including the index of agreement d the same sign index the percentage of cases with the same positive negative anomalies the root mean squared error rmse and the correlation coefficient cc d is calculated as follows d 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 y i y 2 where y i and y i are the predicted and observed values of the ith year n indicates the temporal size of the sample and y represents the average of the observations in this study the dpi is defined as the year to year increment of pinec the sicbs index is defined as the spatially weighted sea ice concentration averaged over the barents sea 72 n 78 n 30 e 60 e the red rectangle in fig 4 in march the niño 3 index is defined as the normalized sst averaged over the niño 3 region in february 150 w 90 w 5 s 5 n the red rectangle in fig 6a the sst pc1 index is defined as the time series of the first leading mode of the rotated empirical orthogonal function reof analysis of sst over the tropical indian ocean and tropical pacific in february and the smi is defined as the soil moisture averaged over northwestern siberia in april 60 e 120 e 60 n 75 n the red rectangle in fig 8a to facilitate conducting prediction models of pinec all of the temporal series including pinec dpi sicbs sst pc1 and smi are standardized 3 characteristics of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china fig 2a shows the first leading mode of the rotated empirical orthogonal function reof analysis of the observed standardized pi over eastern china during 1979 2018 the first leading mode is characterized by consistent positive anomalies over northeastern china 105 e 135 e 40 n 55 n which explains 24 2 of the total variances fig 2a the corresponding time series of reof1 pi pc1 exhibits noticeable interannual and interdecadal variations over northeastern china fig 2b consistent with previous studies li et al 2018a li et al 2020a the time series of the regionally averaged pi over northeastern china pinec is highly correlated with the pi pc1 series fig 2c with a correlation coefficient of 0 92 which is significant at the 99 confidence level based on the student s t test thus the variation of pinec well represents the variation of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china here the dpi year to year increment of pinec is further calculated fig 2d the dpi exhibits a notable quasi biennial oscillation after removing the interdecadal variation hence the prediction signals are amplified by the dpi series which may improve the prediction abilities as indicated in section 2 a negative pinec with a larger absolute value corresponds to a more extreme event of concurrent heatwave and drought to recognize the atmospheric circulation that corresponds to an extreme event when doing a regression analysis the time series of pinec dpi are multiplied by 1 in the following regression analyses fig 3 shows the atmospheric circulation anomalies regressed against the standardized d p i d p i d p i 1 in july august atmospheric circulation over northeastern china is characterized by a homogeneous anticyclonic anomaly from 850 hpa fig 3c to 200 hpa fig 3a which is unfavorable for moisture accumulation in northeastern china because of the moisture divergence there fig 3e the results indicate that there is a warm high fig 3b above northeastern china at 500 hpa with an anomalously hot condition of the atmosphere fig 3f the anomalous downward motion over northeastern china is beneficial to adiabatic heating fig 3d such an anomalous atmosphere circulation pattern over northeastern china is favorable for the formation of dry and hot conditions and hence results in increased concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china in addition to the regional atmospheric circulation anomalies two teleconnection patterns are evident in july august one is the polar route and the other is the equatorial route fig 3 specifically the polar route is featured as the arching teleconnection pattern which originates from the atlantic li et al 2020a and intensifies over the barents sea li et al 2018a li et al 2018a have investigated the possible physical mechanisms regarding the role of the barents sea ice in regulating the polar eurasian pattern pol on the interannual time scale the equatorial route is characterized by the anomalous pacific japan pj pattern which is accompanied by an anomalous downward upward downward pattern over the marine continent northwestern pacific northeastern china fig 3d given that these two anomalous atmospheric teleconnection patterns are closely connected to the occurrence of concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china possible physical mechanisms that regulate these two atmospheric teleconnection patterns are further investigated in the following sections 4 three predictors of the physical empirical prediction model 4 1 barents sea ice in march the standardized sea ice concentration dy from january to august regressed against the standardized d p i during 1979 2018 can be seen in fig 4 results indicate that the decrease of barents sea ice in march is connected with the occurrence of the concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china in the following summer where the decrease of barents sea ice persists from march to june fig 4c d e f since generally there is little sea ice in the barents sea during the late summer no large sea ice anomalies can be found in july august fig 4g h therefore the sicbs index is calculated as the spatially weighted sea ice concentration averaged over the barents sea 72 n 78 n 30 e 60 e in march the correlation coefficient between the sicbs dy index and the dpi index is 0 38 significant at the 95 confidence level based on the student s t test previous studies have revealed the physical mechanisms behind the barents sea ice regulation of summer precipitation and temperature over eastern china li et al 2018a shen et al 2019 the signal of declined sea ice over the barents sea in march can be stored in the sea ice content the snow depth over western eurasia and the soil moisture over eastern china in the subsequent spring and summer which jointly regulate the anomalous atmospheric circulations li et al 2018a fig 5 shows the atmospheric circulation dy in july august regressed against the standardized s i c b s dy s i c b s s i c b s 1 the polar route is notable in july august when sea ice decreases over the barents sea are observed in march the anomalous anticyclone cyclone anticyclone centers over western eurasia polar region northeastern china are obvious from 850 hpa fig 5c to 200 hpa fig 5a besides the geopotential height fig 5b and vertical motion fig 5d at 500 hpa exhibit similar spatial features to the pol wave trains over northern eurasia as a result the positive geopotential anomalies fig 5b the anomalous anticyclone fig 5a c and accompanied downward motion fig 5d jointly contribute to the moisture divergence fig 5e and hot condition of the atmosphere fig 5f over northeastern china leading to more concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china based on the above analysis sea ice over the barents sea in the previous march sicbs dy is chosen as a predictor of the physical empirical model for further prediction analysis 4 2 la niña like sst condition in february generally the ocean has a long memory and the persistence of ocean conditions is the main source of predictability beyond the weather time scale in the climate system gaucherel 2010 lustig et al 2017 fig 6 shows the sst dy regressed against the standardized d p i from february to august the concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china lag a decaying la niña like sst condition in the tropical pacific during february may fig 6a d which gradually evolves into an el niño like sst condition during the subsequent months fig 6e g meanwhile the cold sst anomalies in the tropical indian ocean gradually move eastward and spread over the western tropical pacific during february august fig 6a g to understand this anomalous sst pattern the rotated empirical orthogonal function reof analysis of the sst dy in february over the tropical indian ocean central and tropical pacific region during 1979 2018 is conducted figure s3 results indicate that the first leading sst mode in february shows a large similarity to the reof1 dy sst pattern fig s3a suggesting that the anomalous sst pattern in february fig 6a represents the first reof mode of sst over the tropical indian ocean and the tropical pacific fig s3a in addition the corresponding time series of the first sst mode in february sst pc1 co varies with the niño3 index with a correlation coefficient of 0 96 during 1979 2018 significant at the 99 9 confidence level based on the student s t test thus the first leading mode of the sst pattern in february essentially reflects the interannual variability of enso the sst dy from february to august regressed against the s st p c 1 dy s st p c 1 s s t p c 1 1 also displays a la niña like decaying phase during february may and an el niño like developing phase during the subsequent summer figure s4 which well resembles the results regressed against dpi fig 6 moreover the temporal variation of sst pc1 dy is highly correlated with dpi with a correlation coefficient of 0 40 significant at the 95 confidence level based on the student s t test previous studies also revealed that in la niña s decaying summer anomalous cyclonic circulation and ascending motion are notable over the western pacific chen et al 2017 chen et al 2020 which may influence precipitation and temperature across china zeng et al 2011 zhu et al 2020 hence the sst pc1 index is employed to investigate the mechanisms of this leading sst mode decaying la niña condition affecting the concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china fig 7 shows the atmospheric circulation pattern in july august regressed against the s st p c 1 dy influenced by the cold sst condition over the maritime continental region in july august fig 6f g convective activities weaken significantly over the maritime continent fig 7d then the pj wave train that is featured by the downward upward downward motion over the maritime continent western pacific northeastern china can be triggered fig 7d the anomalous wave train that originates from the maritime continent propagates northeastward influencing the regional atmospheric circulation over northeastern china as a result anomalous downward motion fig 7d and moisture divergence fig 7e prevail over northeastern china which is accompanied by an anticyclone center located from 850 hpa fig 7c to 200 hpa fig 7a an anomalous warm high fig 7b and anomalous hot condition of the atmosphere fig 7f these regional atmospheric circulations are favorable for the occurrence of heatwaves and droughts the above analysis indicates that the reof1 series of the sst sst pc1 over the tropical indian ocean and the tropical pacific in february is a reliable index for the prediction of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china 4 3 soil moisture over northwestern siberia in april previous studies have illustrated that soil moisture has a good memory and can be a precursor of anomalous summer atmospheric circulation koster et al 2016 song et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 associated with the occurrence of the concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china the positive soil moisture anomalies in april are evident over northwestern siberia fig 8a these positive soil moisture anomalies emerge to the north of baikal in february fig s5b while the area and intensity of these anomalies gradually increase in april fig s5d and persist to summer fig s5e h thus the soil moisture index smi is defined as the soil moisture averaged over northwestern siberia 60 e 120 e 60 n 75 n in april the correlation coefficient between the smi dy and dpi is 0 51 during 1979 2018 which is significant at the 99 confidence level based on the student s t test further analyses suggest that the positive soil moisture anomalies over northwestern siberia may persist until summer and affect the overlying atmospheric circulation fig 9 in april a stationary atmospheric wave train may develop over eurasia which is characterized by positive geopotential height anomalies over siberia negative geopotential height anomalies over northeastern china and northern europe and positive geopotential height anomalies over western europe fig 9a this stationary atmospheric wave train is the first leading mode of 500 hpa geopotential height over the northern hemisphere figure not shown corresponding to the positive phase of this wave train pattern positive soil moisture anomalies may occur over northwestern siberia fig 8a because the anomalous southwesterly airflow along the western flank of the anomalous anticyclone over siberia can bring warm and moist air to northwestern siberia fig 9b resulting in anomalous warm and moist condition over this region during april may fig 9c d the anomalous moist and warm condition over northwestern siberia in may can cause more surface evaporation and hence increase surface evaporative cooling over this region through may june contributing to an anomalous cold condition over northwestern siberia in june fig 9e influenced by the anomalous cold condition the atmosphere circulation anomalies begin to reverse in june negative geopotential anomalies develop over northwestern siberia fig 9f accompanied by two positive centers respectively located over northeastern china and western europe in the following months fig 10 b influenced by the positive soil moisture anomalies over northwestern siberia in april the anomalous atmospheric pol wave train is evident along the great circle route which is characterized by positive geopotential height anomalies over western europe and northeastern china and negative geopotential height anomalies over northern siberia fig 10b such a pattern of atmospheric circulation anomaly is similar to the circulation pattern that favors the occurrence of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china fig 3 as a result the anomalous atmospheric circulation in july august induced by the anomalously dry soil moisture over northwestern siberia in april is characterized by the center of positive geopotential height anomalies fig 10b the anomalous anticyclonic center fig 10a c anomalous descending motions fig 10d anomalous moisture divergence fig 10e and anomalous hot atmosphere fig 10f over northeastern china accompanied by abnormally dry condition over northeastern asia fig 8b these anomalous atmospheric circulations and dry moisture conditions over northeastern china are conductive to precipitation deficiency and high temperature conditions thus the soil moisture over northwestern siberia in april is chosen as another predictor for the prediction of concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china 5 physical empirical prediction model of pinec and its validation based on the above analyses three statistical predictors including the barents sea ice concentration dy index in march x 1 the sst pc1 dy index in february x 2 and the northwestern siberia soil moisture dy index in april x 3 for pinec are chosen here the partial correlation coefficients of x 1 x 2 and x 3 with the dpi over northeastern china are 0 36 0 33 0 48 respectively all of which are significant at the 95 confidence level based on the student s t test table 1 in addition the partial correlation coefficients among x 1 x 2 and x 3 all are insignificant table 1 suggesting that they are independent predictors based on the multivariable regression method the physical empirical prediction model for the prediction of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china can be built with the above predictors the model is expressed by dpi 0 03 0 60 x 1 0 34 x 2 0 39 x 3 the predicted dpi fig 11 a dashed red line exhibits a good similarity to the observed dpi fig 11a solid blue line the correlation coefficient between the predictions and observations is 0 68 which is significant at the 99 confidence level based on the student s t test the same sign index of predicted and observed dpi is 77 5 the rmse value is 0 76 and the index of agreement is 0 63 when adding the predicted dpi to the observations in the preceding year the predicted pinec also displays a good covariation with the observed pi with the correlation coefficient of 0 70 significant at a 99 confidence level based on the student s t test the rmse value of 0 76 and the explained variance of 49 therefore the physical empirical prediction model based on these three predictors can well capture the interannual variation and the decreasing trend of the pinec for example the observed pinec value in 2018 was 1 38 ranked the fourth severest concurrent heatwaves and droughts event during 1979 2018 the predicted pinec value in 2018 is 1 34 ranked the fifth severest concurrent heatwaves and droughts event during 1979 2018 this result indicates that the model accurately captures both the value and the severity of this event to further validate the skill of this physical empirical prediction model the cross validation method is employed fig 12 the correlation coefficient between the predicted and the observed dpi is 0 59 significant at a 99 confidence level based on the student s t test besides the same sign index of predicted and observed dpi is 72 5 while the index of agreement is 0 55 fig 12a furthermore the predicted pinec also well captures the decreasing trend of the observed pinec fig 12b and its interannual variation with the correlation coefficient of 0 64 between the predicted pinec and observed pinec significant at a 99 confidence level based on the student s t test the same sign index of predicted and observed pinec is 72 5 while the index of agreement is 0 65 it is found that the correlation coefficients between the predicted and the observed dpi are 0 60 and 0 85 both are significant at the 99 confidence level based on the student s t test for 1979 1996 and 1997 2018 respectively when adding the predicted dpi to the observations in the preceding year the correlation coefficient between the predicted and the observed pinec is only 0 26 for 1979 1996 whereas it is 0 79 significant at a 99 confidence level based on the student s t test for 1997 2018 the obvious difference in correlation coefficient before and after 1997 may be attributed to the interdecadal variation of the relationship between sea ice in the barents sea in march and concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china the 21 yr sliding correlation coefficient between sicbs and pinec shows an obvious interdecadal increase after 1997 whereas the correlation coefficients between sst pc1 smi and pinec remain stable and significant during the whole period figures not shown moreover the hindcast fitted series during 1999 2018 is also calculated fig 13 as shown in fig 13a the predicted dpi well co varies with the observed dpi with a high correlation coefficient of 0 81 significant at the 99 confidence level based on the student s t test the same sign index of the predicted and the observed dpi is 85 and the index of agreement is 0 75 similar results can also be found in the predicted and observed pinec series fig 13b i e the correlation coefficient is 0 75 significant at a 99 confidence level based on the student s t test and the same sign index can be up to 90 6 conclusions and discussion based on the multivariate copula method this study investigates the physical mechanisms of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china results indicate that the concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china are closely connected with the polar eurasian teleconnection pattern and the pacific japan teleconnection pattern further analyses suggest that sea ice in the barents sea in march and soil moisture in northwestern siberia in april jointly regulate the pol wave train in july august through sea ice atmosphere interaction and land atmosphere interaction and the la niña like sst in february regulates the pj wave train in july august through ocean atmosphere interaction therefore the sea ice content in the barents sea in march the la niña like sst in february and the northwestern siberia soil moisture in april are chosen as the three potential predictors based on the corresponding physical mechanisms the physical empirical prediction model is constructed using the year to year increment approach results indicate that the physical empirical prediction model performs well in predicting the interannual variation of pinec the cross validation test and the independent hindcasts also exhibit similar results the above findings suggest a good predictive skill of this physical empirical prediction model based on the three predictors to examine the robustness of the above results the era5 reanalysis data are also used in this study based on the era5 reanalysis data the pol pattern and the pj pattern are evident when concurrent heatwave and droughts occur over northeastern china figure s6 the decrease of barents sea ice in march is associated with the occurrence of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china figure s7 with pol wave train in late summer propagating from western eurasia towards northeastern china figure s8 these results resemble the results based on the hadley centre sea ice data fig 4 and the necp ncar reanalysis data fig 5 besides the anomalies of sst derived from era5 figure s9 also show many similarities to that derived from the hadley centre sst data fig 6 figure s4 the concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china lag a decaying la niña condition during february may fig s9a d which gradually evolves into an el niño condition during the subsequent months fig s9e g the la niña like sst anomalies in february affect the pj wave train in late summer through ocean atmosphere interaction figure s10 which shows a large similarity to the results based on ncep ncar reanalysis data fig 7 moreover the positive soil moisture anomalies in april over northwestern siberia regulate the pol pattern through land atmosphere interaction which further influences regional atmospheric circulations and concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china figure s11 figure s12 and figure s13 similar to the results based on the ncep ncar reanalysis data fig 8 fig 9 and fig 10 overall the results based on the era5 data largely resemble that based on the necp ncar reanalysis data and hadley centre data thus the physical mechanisms of concurrent heatwaves and droughts proposed in this study are relatively robust furthermore the prediction model proposed in this study may help to predict concurrent heatwaves and droughts in northeastern china which have a significant impact on agriculture recently northeastern china experienced two extreme record concurrent heatwaves and droughts in 2000 and 2016 both leading to severe decreases in crop production with subsequent economic losses reaching cny 15 billion in 2000 there were obvious anomalous negative sst anomalies over the eastern tropical pacific an anomalous decrease of sea ice in the barents sea in march and positive soil moisture anomalies over northwestern siberia in april figure s14 the hindcast prediction of 2000 is constructed using the pinec dpi series of 1979 1999 and using the values of sicbs in march smi in april and sst pc1 in february of 2000 results indicated that the predicted standardized pinec in 2000 is 1 88 with the lowest value in recent 20 years well resembling the obvious standardized pinec in 2000 the value was 1 72 the lowest one in recent 20 years fig 13 thus the severe concurrent heatwaves and droughts in 2000 can be accurately predicted three months ahead of time and may get an early warning of crop production risks in 2016 there was an anomalous decrease of sea ice in the barents sea in march and anomalous positive soil moisture over northwestern siberia in april while anomalous positive sst over the eastern tropical pacific was evident figure s15 the hindcast prediction of 2016 is constructed using the pinec dpi series of 1979 2015 and using the values of sicbs in march smi in april and sst pc1 in february of 2016 since the sst condition in 2016 was contrary to the physical prediction model the predicted standardized pinec in 2016 is 0 86 smaller than the obvious standardized pinec of 1 56 fig 13 despite the lower intensity it may also provide an early warning for agriculture moreover it is predicted that during 1979 2018 ten extreme concurrent heatwave and drought pinec smaller than 1 events occurred in 1981 1995 2000 2001 2002 2007 2011 2015 2017 and 2018 these prediction results are largely consistent with the observation except that in 1981 and 1995 the concurrent heatwave and drought event did not actually occur thus this physical empirical prediction model may provide an early warning of concurrent heatwaves and droughts and agriculture risks three months in advance further analyses indicate that the pinec exhibits an observed interdecadal decrease around 1996 1997 corresponding to the interdecadal increase of concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china both the time series of the predicted pinec figure s16 and the cross validation fitted pinec figure s17 well capture this interdecadal variation despite the good performance of the prediction model in predicting interdecadal variation and interannual variation during 1979 2018 the physical empirical prediction model performs well after 1997 but not for the period before 1996 figs 10 11 previous studies have suggested that the atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo may account for this interdecadal change around the late 1990 s li et al 2018a li et al 2020a which could be the possible reason why the performance of this physical empirical prediction model improves significantly after 1997 further in depth studies are necessary to explore the interdecadal prediction of pinec and possible amo impacts on pinec additionally previous studies have revealed that the variations of the pacific decadal oscillation pdo may regulate drought events across china yang et al 2018 song and wang 2020 wei et al 2021 besides fig 6 indicates that the negative sst anomalies in the equatorial atlantic ocean in april are significantly correlated to the concurrent heatwave and droughts in northeastern china these negative sst anomalies emerge about two months later than that in the pacific ocean which emerge earlier in february thus the sst variations in the atlantic ocean e g atlantic nino may also regulate the concurrent heatwave and droughts in northeastern china which deserve further investigations therefore the inclusion of atlantic sst anomalies pdo and amo in the prediction model can possibly improve the prediction skill of the concurrent heatwave and droughts in northeastern china credit authorship contribution statement huixin li conceptualization methodology software formal analysis investigation writing original draft bo

2744,concurrent heatwaves and droughts that occur over northeastern china nec bring severe threats to human lives and crop production despite the great efforts taken in previous studies realistic prediction of these concurrent extreme events remains a challenge in the present study a probability based index that simultaneously considers precipitation deficiency and high temperature is calculated to represent concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over nec based on this index the characteristics of concurrent heatwaves and droughts over nec in july august are investigated using the year to year increment approach the results indicate that the occurrence of concurrent heatwaves and droughts over nec is closely related to the polar eurasian teleconnection pattern and the pacific japan teleconnection pattern further analyses indicate that the sea ice content in the barents sea in march sicbs the la niña like sea surface temperature sst in february sst pc1 and the northwestern siberia soil moisture in april sm are coincidently linked to the two teleconnection patterns mentioned above based on their corresponding physical mechanisms these three independent predictors are chosen to construct a physical empirical prediction model for the prediction of concurrent heatwaves and droughts over nec results suggest that this physical empirical prediction model performs well with a high correlation coefficient and a low root mean squared error between the observed and predicted concurrent heatwaves and droughts over nec during the period of 1979 2018 moreover the cross validation test and independent hindcasts both suggest that the physical empirical model proposed in the present study with the three independent predictors has good prediction skills keywords concurrent heatwaves and droughts northeastern china mechanisms physical empirical prediction model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction northeastern china is the granary of china where crop production is sensitive to climate conditions concurrent heatwaves and droughts are particularly threatening to crop production in this region li et al 2018a compared to traditional drought events the concurrent heatwaves and droughts would be more disastrous for human lives and crop production recently the northeastern china experienced severe concurrent heatwaves and droughts which led to significant production risks li et al 2018a for example soybean and maize production decreased by 30 due to the concurrent heatwave and drought that occurred in northeastern china in 2018 https www tianqi com news 226592 html in the context of global warming the concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china became more severe and occurred more frequently in the past decades li et al 2015 which may be regulated by both internal variabilities of the climate system li et al 2018a li et al 2020a and human activities li et al 2020b most of the previous studies only focused on the mechanisms and prediction of traditional extreme events that are solely dependent on a single variable han et al 2017 sun et al 2017 han et al 2020 whereas the concurrent heatwaves and droughts may bring severe disasters and deserve more attention recently few studies simultaneously considered precipitation deficiency and high temperature to investigate concurrent heatwaves and droughts li et al 2018a li et al 2020a li et al 2020b given the importance to improve the prediction skills for concurrent heatwaves and droughts it is of great significance to investigate the physical mechanisms and improve the seasonal prediction of concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china recently possible physical mechanisms for the concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china were investigated by li et al 2018a results indicated that the variation of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china may be largely influenced by the variation of spring sea ice content over the barents sea on the interannual timescale li et al 2018a however this study mainly focused on the variation of sea ice in march while other internal variabilities of the climate system were not deeply investigated in addition to sea ice a previous study found that some other factors in the high latitudes and mid to low latitudes may also influence climate conditions across china jian et al 2020 for example the snow cover and soil moisture over eurasia may modulate atmospheric teleconnection patterns and climate conditions across china barnett et al 1988 zhang and zuo 2011 li and wang 2014 zhang et al 2016 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 besides many studies also found that the low latitude sst could regulate the distribution of rain belts over eastern china via air sea interaction processes wu et al 2003 feng and hu 2004 liu et al 2019 sun et al 2019 besides the atlantic multidecadal oscillation and human activities may influence the variations of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china on the interdecadal li et al 2020a and long trend li et al 2020b time scales hence further in depth studies are necessary to explore possible influences of the internal variabilities of the climate system in high latitudes and mid to low latitudes on the concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china various approaches include dynamical models kang et al 2004 chen and sun 2020 ren and nie 2021 and physical empirical prediction models have been used to predict climatic events a physical empirical model refers to an empirical prediction model established based on understanding of the physical mechanisms linking the predictors e g preceding winter sst and the predictant e g summer rainfall xing et al 2017 the method of physical empirical model has been widely used for predicting climate anomalies and extreme events e g yim et al 2015 luo and wang 2018 chen and sun 2020 hadipour et al 2020 the linear regression method is commonly used to construct the physical empirical prediction models fan and tian 2013 ji and fan 2019 currently the overall performance of dynamic models in the prediction of extreme events across china remains poor ma et al 2015 for this reason various downscaling methods dai and fan 2021 and physical empirical prediction models xiao and wang 2017 have been proposed some studies fan et al 2008 fan and wang 2010 zhu 2011 predicted climate conditions using the year to year increment dy approach proposed by fan et al 2008 traditionally the investigation and prediction of extreme climate only focus on unique events for example snow activity fan and tian 2013 dust events ji and fan 2019 extreme precipitation events tian and fan 2020 han et al 2020 sea surface temperature chen and sun 2020 and air temperature fan and wang 2010 ma et al 2015 etc few studies consider compound extreme events e g concurrent heatwaves and droughts recently several models for the prediction of precipitation ma and sun 2021 and hot days zhang et al 2019 over northeastern china were constructed nevertheless studies on the prediction of concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china are quite limited whether the physical empirical prediction model can well predict the concurrent events over northeastern china remains unknown therefore the main purpose of this study is to reveal the physical mechanisms for concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china influences from high latitudes and mid to low latitudes are considered based on the physical mechanisms and the year to year increment method a physical empirical model for the prediction of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china is proposed with the hope to improve the prediction of the aforementioned concurrent events this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the datasets and the methods used in the present study with ncar command language matlab cdo and r software implemented in this research section 3 briefly illustrates the spatial temporal characteristics of the concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china and corresponding atmospheric circulations the three predictors and possible physical mechanisms for the concurrent heatwaves and droughts are analyzed in section 4 in section 5 the physical empirical prediction model and its validation for the prediction of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china are described conclusions and discussions are given in section 6 2 data and methods 2 1 data the gridded monthly precipitation and surface air temperature observational datasets hereafter referred to as cn05 1 for the period 1961 2018 are used in this study the cn05 1 data was developed by wu and gao 2013 based on observations at 2416 stations across china using the anomaly interpolation method where the climatology field is interpolated first followed by the interpolation of the anomaly field and finally the two are combined new et al 2000 to obtain a fine gridded dataset the cn05 1 data has been widely used in numerous studies on climate variation in china which has been demonstrated to be capable to well reflects the variation of climate anomalies over china ma et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 li et al 2018b li et al 2020b zhu et al 2020 zhu et al 2022 the spatial resolution of cn05 1 is 1 1 the monthly global necp ncar reanalysis dataset with a spatial resolution of 2 5 2 5 is employed in this study kalnay et al 1996 which is interpolated onto a 1 1 grid using the bilinear interpolation method provided by the climate data operators cdo geopotential height meridional and zonal winds 0 10 cm soil moisture air temperature specific humidity and vertical velocity are extracted from the ncep ncar reanalysis data for the present study monthly sea ice concentration sic and sea surface temperature sst are obtained from the hadley centre sea ice and sst dataset version 1 which has a horizontal resolution of 1 1 rayner 2003 besides the era5 reanalysis datasets with a spatial resolution of 1 1 are also employed in this study https cds climate copernicus eu geopotential height meridional and zonal winds volumetric soil water layer 1 air temperature specific humidity vertical velocity sic and sst are extracted from the era5 reanalysis data for the present study 2 2 methods concurrent heatwaves and droughts are expected to increase under a warming climate aghakouchak et al 2020 for example the concurrent heatwave and droughts that occurred in california in 2014 led to a significant water crisis with record low storage levels and severe wildfires aghakouchak et al 2014a aghakouchak et al 2014b therefore the concurrent heatwave and drought event is defined by a probability based index pi which is calculated using the joint cumulative distribution of precipitation x 1 and temperature x 2 temporal series over northeastern china traditionally the cumulative distribution function cdf of precipitation and temperature is expressed as f 1 x 1 p x 1 x 1 and f 2 x 2 p x 2 x 2 respectively the joint survival function f i can be used to identify the concurrent heatwave and drought which is defined as f i 1 f i different copula families t copula gaussian copula gumbel copula etc are employed to construct joint distribution in this study and the goodness of fit is implemented based on empirical copula process kojadinovic and yan 2011 which is a nonparametric rank based estimator of the true copula here the empirical copula is classically defined as the empirical cdf computed from the pseudo observations if we expected that the null hypothesis is accepted at the 95 confidence level significance level of 0 05 p value should be larger than 0 05 and a larger p value represents a better fit kojadinovic and yan 2010 results suggest that the t copula fits best with an acceptable p value 0 655 indicating a representative fit at 95 confidence kojadinovic and yan 2010 in this method precipitation deficiency is defined by precipitation anomaly x 1 smaller than a certain anomaly threshold x 1 where x 1 x 1 similarly high temperature is defined by temperature anomaly x 2 larger than a certain anomaly threshold x 2 where x 2 x 2 here the precipitation anomaly temperature anomaly is calculated by taking the difference between the july august mean precipitation temperature value in the current year and the climatological mean of the july august precipitation temperature for the years 1979 2018 in particular for the sake of the multivariate copula method the x 1 and x 1 are multiplied by 1 where x 1 x 1 1 x 1 x 1 1 and hence x 1 x 1 consequently the joint survival cdf is calculated by pi f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 p x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 which reflects how extreme the event is based on the joint survival cdf the survival layer l t f is calculated as l t f x r d f x t where t is a probability level the survival kendall s return period κ x is defined as κ x μ 1 k t where μ is the recurrence interval and k t is the survival function associated that calculated as k t p f x 1 x 2 t p p i t salvadori et al 2013 given a particular level of return period t the survival layer l t f is estimated as q q p k 1 p at the probability level p p 1 μ t where q is the survival kendall s quantile of order p generally most observed concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china are concentrated in july august li et al 2018a and the spatial temporal characteristics of pi in june are noticeably different from that in july august figure s1 therefore pi is calculated using monthly mean data of precipitation and temperature in july august on a grid cell basis where pi varies between zero and unity the pinec index is defined as the regionally averaged standardized pi over northeastern china 110 e 135 e 42 n 55 n the red rectangle in fig 2 a and a negative pinec with a larger absolute value corresponds to a higher return period event of heatwave and drought over northeastern china li et al 2018a li et al 2020a where a higher return period event refers to a more extreme event for example northeastern china experienced a severe concurrent heatwave and drought event during july august in 2016 the precipitation anomaly was 104 3 mm and the temperature anomaly was 1 8 c fig 1 based on this method the original series of pi was the second lowest value to be 0 06 figure s2 and the return period ranked the second highest value during the past 60 years about 30 years fig 1 suggesting a severe concurrent heatwave and drought event the year to year increment dy approach is used to build the physical empirical prediction model in this study dy is defined as the difference of a variable between the current year and the preceding year fan et al 2008 for example d p i 2018 p i 2018 p i 2017 based on the method the predicted variable is calculated by adding the predicted dy value to the preceding year s value for example the predicted pi current year the predicted dpi the observed pi preceding year generally the precipitation and temperature in summer exhibit quasi biennial oscillation qbo characteristics in the east asian region chen et al 2006 considering the influence of qbo on climate systems the anomalies of pi in the current year δ pi i and in the preceding year δ p i i 1 can be represented as δ pi i pi i pi x δ i and δ p i i 1 pi i 1 pi x δ i 1 respectively here δ i 1 and δ i are disturbances of x and can be ignored when compared with x as a result δ pi i x and the dy of pi can be calculated as d p i pi i pi i 1 δ pi i δ p i i 1 2 x the year to year increment anomaly d p i is approximately twice as the δ pi i where δ pi i is a traditional predictant in the prediction approach hence the prediction signals are amplified by the dy prediction approach which has been widely used since it may significantly improve the prediction ability fan et al 2008 fan and wang 2010 besides qian et al 2018 indicated that the dy method is suitable to consider non gaussian extreme variables and the urbanized effect given the advantages of the year to year approach the dy method is employed to predict the concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china based on the physical mechanisms the explanations of physical mechanisms are given in section 4 the multiple linear regression model of dpi is constructed and the dpi is predicted as d p i i a 0 j 1 n a j predictor j i where a 0 and a j are regression coefficients i is the certain year and n denotes the total number of predictors then the predicted dpi is added to the preceding year s observed pi to calculate the predicted pi e g p i p r e d i c t e d 2018 d p i p r e d i c t e d 2018 p i o b s e r v e d 2017 besides the cross validation method and the independent hindcast are used to estimate the skill of the physical empirical prediction model the cross validation method systematically deletes one year s value and constructs a physical empirical prediction model based on the multiple linear regression method the independent hindcasts for dpi and pinec during 1999 2018 are also constructed while a model is established on a time series from 1961 to the year before the target year then the final pinec is calculated by adding the predicted dpi to the observed pinec from the preceding year four statistical measures are employed to evaluate the performance of the physical empirical prediction model including the index of agreement d the same sign index the percentage of cases with the same positive negative anomalies the root mean squared error rmse and the correlation coefficient cc d is calculated as follows d 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 y i y 2 where y i and y i are the predicted and observed values of the ith year n indicates the temporal size of the sample and y represents the average of the observations in this study the dpi is defined as the year to year increment of pinec the sicbs index is defined as the spatially weighted sea ice concentration averaged over the barents sea 72 n 78 n 30 e 60 e the red rectangle in fig 4 in march the niño 3 index is defined as the normalized sst averaged over the niño 3 region in february 150 w 90 w 5 s 5 n the red rectangle in fig 6a the sst pc1 index is defined as the time series of the first leading mode of the rotated empirical orthogonal function reof analysis of sst over the tropical indian ocean and tropical pacific in february and the smi is defined as the soil moisture averaged over northwestern siberia in april 60 e 120 e 60 n 75 n the red rectangle in fig 8a to facilitate conducting prediction models of pinec all of the temporal series including pinec dpi sicbs sst pc1 and smi are standardized 3 characteristics of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china fig 2a shows the first leading mode of the rotated empirical orthogonal function reof analysis of the observed standardized pi over eastern china during 1979 2018 the first leading mode is characterized by consistent positive anomalies over northeastern china 105 e 135 e 40 n 55 n which explains 24 2 of the total variances fig 2a the corresponding time series of reof1 pi pc1 exhibits noticeable interannual and interdecadal variations over northeastern china fig 2b consistent with previous studies li et al 2018a li et al 2020a the time series of the regionally averaged pi over northeastern china pinec is highly correlated with the pi pc1 series fig 2c with a correlation coefficient of 0 92 which is significant at the 99 confidence level based on the student s t test thus the variation of pinec well represents the variation of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china here the dpi year to year increment of pinec is further calculated fig 2d the dpi exhibits a notable quasi biennial oscillation after removing the interdecadal variation hence the prediction signals are amplified by the dpi series which may improve the prediction abilities as indicated in section 2 a negative pinec with a larger absolute value corresponds to a more extreme event of concurrent heatwave and drought to recognize the atmospheric circulation that corresponds to an extreme event when doing a regression analysis the time series of pinec dpi are multiplied by 1 in the following regression analyses fig 3 shows the atmospheric circulation anomalies regressed against the standardized d p i d p i d p i 1 in july august atmospheric circulation over northeastern china is characterized by a homogeneous anticyclonic anomaly from 850 hpa fig 3c to 200 hpa fig 3a which is unfavorable for moisture accumulation in northeastern china because of the moisture divergence there fig 3e the results indicate that there is a warm high fig 3b above northeastern china at 500 hpa with an anomalously hot condition of the atmosphere fig 3f the anomalous downward motion over northeastern china is beneficial to adiabatic heating fig 3d such an anomalous atmosphere circulation pattern over northeastern china is favorable for the formation of dry and hot conditions and hence results in increased concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china in addition to the regional atmospheric circulation anomalies two teleconnection patterns are evident in july august one is the polar route and the other is the equatorial route fig 3 specifically the polar route is featured as the arching teleconnection pattern which originates from the atlantic li et al 2020a and intensifies over the barents sea li et al 2018a li et al 2018a have investigated the possible physical mechanisms regarding the role of the barents sea ice in regulating the polar eurasian pattern pol on the interannual time scale the equatorial route is characterized by the anomalous pacific japan pj pattern which is accompanied by an anomalous downward upward downward pattern over the marine continent northwestern pacific northeastern china fig 3d given that these two anomalous atmospheric teleconnection patterns are closely connected to the occurrence of concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china possible physical mechanisms that regulate these two atmospheric teleconnection patterns are further investigated in the following sections 4 three predictors of the physical empirical prediction model 4 1 barents sea ice in march the standardized sea ice concentration dy from january to august regressed against the standardized d p i during 1979 2018 can be seen in fig 4 results indicate that the decrease of barents sea ice in march is connected with the occurrence of the concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china in the following summer where the decrease of barents sea ice persists from march to june fig 4c d e f since generally there is little sea ice in the barents sea during the late summer no large sea ice anomalies can be found in july august fig 4g h therefore the sicbs index is calculated as the spatially weighted sea ice concentration averaged over the barents sea 72 n 78 n 30 e 60 e in march the correlation coefficient between the sicbs dy index and the dpi index is 0 38 significant at the 95 confidence level based on the student s t test previous studies have revealed the physical mechanisms behind the barents sea ice regulation of summer precipitation and temperature over eastern china li et al 2018a shen et al 2019 the signal of declined sea ice over the barents sea in march can be stored in the sea ice content the snow depth over western eurasia and the soil moisture over eastern china in the subsequent spring and summer which jointly regulate the anomalous atmospheric circulations li et al 2018a fig 5 shows the atmospheric circulation dy in july august regressed against the standardized s i c b s dy s i c b s s i c b s 1 the polar route is notable in july august when sea ice decreases over the barents sea are observed in march the anomalous anticyclone cyclone anticyclone centers over western eurasia polar region northeastern china are obvious from 850 hpa fig 5c to 200 hpa fig 5a besides the geopotential height fig 5b and vertical motion fig 5d at 500 hpa exhibit similar spatial features to the pol wave trains over northern eurasia as a result the positive geopotential anomalies fig 5b the anomalous anticyclone fig 5a c and accompanied downward motion fig 5d jointly contribute to the moisture divergence fig 5e and hot condition of the atmosphere fig 5f over northeastern china leading to more concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china based on the above analysis sea ice over the barents sea in the previous march sicbs dy is chosen as a predictor of the physical empirical model for further prediction analysis 4 2 la niña like sst condition in february generally the ocean has a long memory and the persistence of ocean conditions is the main source of predictability beyond the weather time scale in the climate system gaucherel 2010 lustig et al 2017 fig 6 shows the sst dy regressed against the standardized d p i from february to august the concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china lag a decaying la niña like sst condition in the tropical pacific during february may fig 6a d which gradually evolves into an el niño like sst condition during the subsequent months fig 6e g meanwhile the cold sst anomalies in the tropical indian ocean gradually move eastward and spread over the western tropical pacific during february august fig 6a g to understand this anomalous sst pattern the rotated empirical orthogonal function reof analysis of the sst dy in february over the tropical indian ocean central and tropical pacific region during 1979 2018 is conducted figure s3 results indicate that the first leading sst mode in february shows a large similarity to the reof1 dy sst pattern fig s3a suggesting that the anomalous sst pattern in february fig 6a represents the first reof mode of sst over the tropical indian ocean and the tropical pacific fig s3a in addition the corresponding time series of the first sst mode in february sst pc1 co varies with the niño3 index with a correlation coefficient of 0 96 during 1979 2018 significant at the 99 9 confidence level based on the student s t test thus the first leading mode of the sst pattern in february essentially reflects the interannual variability of enso the sst dy from february to august regressed against the s st p c 1 dy s st p c 1 s s t p c 1 1 also displays a la niña like decaying phase during february may and an el niño like developing phase during the subsequent summer figure s4 which well resembles the results regressed against dpi fig 6 moreover the temporal variation of sst pc1 dy is highly correlated with dpi with a correlation coefficient of 0 40 significant at the 95 confidence level based on the student s t test previous studies also revealed that in la niña s decaying summer anomalous cyclonic circulation and ascending motion are notable over the western pacific chen et al 2017 chen et al 2020 which may influence precipitation and temperature across china zeng et al 2011 zhu et al 2020 hence the sst pc1 index is employed to investigate the mechanisms of this leading sst mode decaying la niña condition affecting the concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china fig 7 shows the atmospheric circulation pattern in july august regressed against the s st p c 1 dy influenced by the cold sst condition over the maritime continental region in july august fig 6f g convective activities weaken significantly over the maritime continent fig 7d then the pj wave train that is featured by the downward upward downward motion over the maritime continent western pacific northeastern china can be triggered fig 7d the anomalous wave train that originates from the maritime continent propagates northeastward influencing the regional atmospheric circulation over northeastern china as a result anomalous downward motion fig 7d and moisture divergence fig 7e prevail over northeastern china which is accompanied by an anticyclone center located from 850 hpa fig 7c to 200 hpa fig 7a an anomalous warm high fig 7b and anomalous hot condition of the atmosphere fig 7f these regional atmospheric circulations are favorable for the occurrence of heatwaves and droughts the above analysis indicates that the reof1 series of the sst sst pc1 over the tropical indian ocean and the tropical pacific in february is a reliable index for the prediction of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china 4 3 soil moisture over northwestern siberia in april previous studies have illustrated that soil moisture has a good memory and can be a precursor of anomalous summer atmospheric circulation koster et al 2016 song et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 associated with the occurrence of the concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china the positive soil moisture anomalies in april are evident over northwestern siberia fig 8a these positive soil moisture anomalies emerge to the north of baikal in february fig s5b while the area and intensity of these anomalies gradually increase in april fig s5d and persist to summer fig s5e h thus the soil moisture index smi is defined as the soil moisture averaged over northwestern siberia 60 e 120 e 60 n 75 n in april the correlation coefficient between the smi dy and dpi is 0 51 during 1979 2018 which is significant at the 99 confidence level based on the student s t test further analyses suggest that the positive soil moisture anomalies over northwestern siberia may persist until summer and affect the overlying atmospheric circulation fig 9 in april a stationary atmospheric wave train may develop over eurasia which is characterized by positive geopotential height anomalies over siberia negative geopotential height anomalies over northeastern china and northern europe and positive geopotential height anomalies over western europe fig 9a this stationary atmospheric wave train is the first leading mode of 500 hpa geopotential height over the northern hemisphere figure not shown corresponding to the positive phase of this wave train pattern positive soil moisture anomalies may occur over northwestern siberia fig 8a because the anomalous southwesterly airflow along the western flank of the anomalous anticyclone over siberia can bring warm and moist air to northwestern siberia fig 9b resulting in anomalous warm and moist condition over this region during april may fig 9c d the anomalous moist and warm condition over northwestern siberia in may can cause more surface evaporation and hence increase surface evaporative cooling over this region through may june contributing to an anomalous cold condition over northwestern siberia in june fig 9e influenced by the anomalous cold condition the atmosphere circulation anomalies begin to reverse in june negative geopotential anomalies develop over northwestern siberia fig 9f accompanied by two positive centers respectively located over northeastern china and western europe in the following months fig 10 b influenced by the positive soil moisture anomalies over northwestern siberia in april the anomalous atmospheric pol wave train is evident along the great circle route which is characterized by positive geopotential height anomalies over western europe and northeastern china and negative geopotential height anomalies over northern siberia fig 10b such a pattern of atmospheric circulation anomaly is similar to the circulation pattern that favors the occurrence of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china fig 3 as a result the anomalous atmospheric circulation in july august induced by the anomalously dry soil moisture over northwestern siberia in april is characterized by the center of positive geopotential height anomalies fig 10b the anomalous anticyclonic center fig 10a c anomalous descending motions fig 10d anomalous moisture divergence fig 10e and anomalous hot atmosphere fig 10f over northeastern china accompanied by abnormally dry condition over northeastern asia fig 8b these anomalous atmospheric circulations and dry moisture conditions over northeastern china are conductive to precipitation deficiency and high temperature conditions thus the soil moisture over northwestern siberia in april is chosen as another predictor for the prediction of concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china 5 physical empirical prediction model of pinec and its validation based on the above analyses three statistical predictors including the barents sea ice concentration dy index in march x 1 the sst pc1 dy index in february x 2 and the northwestern siberia soil moisture dy index in april x 3 for pinec are chosen here the partial correlation coefficients of x 1 x 2 and x 3 with the dpi over northeastern china are 0 36 0 33 0 48 respectively all of which are significant at the 95 confidence level based on the student s t test table 1 in addition the partial correlation coefficients among x 1 x 2 and x 3 all are insignificant table 1 suggesting that they are independent predictors based on the multivariable regression method the physical empirical prediction model for the prediction of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china can be built with the above predictors the model is expressed by dpi 0 03 0 60 x 1 0 34 x 2 0 39 x 3 the predicted dpi fig 11 a dashed red line exhibits a good similarity to the observed dpi fig 11a solid blue line the correlation coefficient between the predictions and observations is 0 68 which is significant at the 99 confidence level based on the student s t test the same sign index of predicted and observed dpi is 77 5 the rmse value is 0 76 and the index of agreement is 0 63 when adding the predicted dpi to the observations in the preceding year the predicted pinec also displays a good covariation with the observed pi with the correlation coefficient of 0 70 significant at a 99 confidence level based on the student s t test the rmse value of 0 76 and the explained variance of 49 therefore the physical empirical prediction model based on these three predictors can well capture the interannual variation and the decreasing trend of the pinec for example the observed pinec value in 2018 was 1 38 ranked the fourth severest concurrent heatwaves and droughts event during 1979 2018 the predicted pinec value in 2018 is 1 34 ranked the fifth severest concurrent heatwaves and droughts event during 1979 2018 this result indicates that the model accurately captures both the value and the severity of this event to further validate the skill of this physical empirical prediction model the cross validation method is employed fig 12 the correlation coefficient between the predicted and the observed dpi is 0 59 significant at a 99 confidence level based on the student s t test besides the same sign index of predicted and observed dpi is 72 5 while the index of agreement is 0 55 fig 12a furthermore the predicted pinec also well captures the decreasing trend of the observed pinec fig 12b and its interannual variation with the correlation coefficient of 0 64 between the predicted pinec and observed pinec significant at a 99 confidence level based on the student s t test the same sign index of predicted and observed pinec is 72 5 while the index of agreement is 0 65 it is found that the correlation coefficients between the predicted and the observed dpi are 0 60 and 0 85 both are significant at the 99 confidence level based on the student s t test for 1979 1996 and 1997 2018 respectively when adding the predicted dpi to the observations in the preceding year the correlation coefficient between the predicted and the observed pinec is only 0 26 for 1979 1996 whereas it is 0 79 significant at a 99 confidence level based on the student s t test for 1997 2018 the obvious difference in correlation coefficient before and after 1997 may be attributed to the interdecadal variation of the relationship between sea ice in the barents sea in march and concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china the 21 yr sliding correlation coefficient between sicbs and pinec shows an obvious interdecadal increase after 1997 whereas the correlation coefficients between sst pc1 smi and pinec remain stable and significant during the whole period figures not shown moreover the hindcast fitted series during 1999 2018 is also calculated fig 13 as shown in fig 13a the predicted dpi well co varies with the observed dpi with a high correlation coefficient of 0 81 significant at the 99 confidence level based on the student s t test the same sign index of the predicted and the observed dpi is 85 and the index of agreement is 0 75 similar results can also be found in the predicted and observed pinec series fig 13b i e the correlation coefficient is 0 75 significant at a 99 confidence level based on the student s t test and the same sign index can be up to 90 6 conclusions and discussion based on the multivariate copula method this study investigates the physical mechanisms of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china results indicate that the concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china are closely connected with the polar eurasian teleconnection pattern and the pacific japan teleconnection pattern further analyses suggest that sea ice in the barents sea in march and soil moisture in northwestern siberia in april jointly regulate the pol wave train in july august through sea ice atmosphere interaction and land atmosphere interaction and the la niña like sst in february regulates the pj wave train in july august through ocean atmosphere interaction therefore the sea ice content in the barents sea in march the la niña like sst in february and the northwestern siberia soil moisture in april are chosen as the three potential predictors based on the corresponding physical mechanisms the physical empirical prediction model is constructed using the year to year increment approach results indicate that the physical empirical prediction model performs well in predicting the interannual variation of pinec the cross validation test and the independent hindcasts also exhibit similar results the above findings suggest a good predictive skill of this physical empirical prediction model based on the three predictors to examine the robustness of the above results the era5 reanalysis data are also used in this study based on the era5 reanalysis data the pol pattern and the pj pattern are evident when concurrent heatwave and droughts occur over northeastern china figure s6 the decrease of barents sea ice in march is associated with the occurrence of concurrent heatwaves and droughts in july august over northeastern china figure s7 with pol wave train in late summer propagating from western eurasia towards northeastern china figure s8 these results resemble the results based on the hadley centre sea ice data fig 4 and the necp ncar reanalysis data fig 5 besides the anomalies of sst derived from era5 figure s9 also show many similarities to that derived from the hadley centre sst data fig 6 figure s4 the concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china lag a decaying la niña condition during february may fig s9a d which gradually evolves into an el niño condition during the subsequent months fig s9e g the la niña like sst anomalies in february affect the pj wave train in late summer through ocean atmosphere interaction figure s10 which shows a large similarity to the results based on ncep ncar reanalysis data fig 7 moreover the positive soil moisture anomalies in april over northwestern siberia regulate the pol pattern through land atmosphere interaction which further influences regional atmospheric circulations and concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china figure s11 figure s12 and figure s13 similar to the results based on the ncep ncar reanalysis data fig 8 fig 9 and fig 10 overall the results based on the era5 data largely resemble that based on the necp ncar reanalysis data and hadley centre data thus the physical mechanisms of concurrent heatwaves and droughts proposed in this study are relatively robust furthermore the prediction model proposed in this study may help to predict concurrent heatwaves and droughts in northeastern china which have a significant impact on agriculture recently northeastern china experienced two extreme record concurrent heatwaves and droughts in 2000 and 2016 both leading to severe decreases in crop production with subsequent economic losses reaching cny 15 billion in 2000 there were obvious anomalous negative sst anomalies over the eastern tropical pacific an anomalous decrease of sea ice in the barents sea in march and positive soil moisture anomalies over northwestern siberia in april figure s14 the hindcast prediction of 2000 is constructed using the pinec dpi series of 1979 1999 and using the values of sicbs in march smi in april and sst pc1 in february of 2000 results indicated that the predicted standardized pinec in 2000 is 1 88 with the lowest value in recent 20 years well resembling the obvious standardized pinec in 2000 the value was 1 72 the lowest one in recent 20 years fig 13 thus the severe concurrent heatwaves and droughts in 2000 can be accurately predicted three months ahead of time and may get an early warning of crop production risks in 2016 there was an anomalous decrease of sea ice in the barents sea in march and anomalous positive soil moisture over northwestern siberia in april while anomalous positive sst over the eastern tropical pacific was evident figure s15 the hindcast prediction of 2016 is constructed using the pinec dpi series of 1979 2015 and using the values of sicbs in march smi in april and sst pc1 in february of 2016 since the sst condition in 2016 was contrary to the physical prediction model the predicted standardized pinec in 2016 is 0 86 smaller than the obvious standardized pinec of 1 56 fig 13 despite the lower intensity it may also provide an early warning for agriculture moreover it is predicted that during 1979 2018 ten extreme concurrent heatwave and drought pinec smaller than 1 events occurred in 1981 1995 2000 2001 2002 2007 2011 2015 2017 and 2018 these prediction results are largely consistent with the observation except that in 1981 and 1995 the concurrent heatwave and drought event did not actually occur thus this physical empirical prediction model may provide an early warning of concurrent heatwaves and droughts and agriculture risks three months in advance further analyses indicate that the pinec exhibits an observed interdecadal decrease around 1996 1997 corresponding to the interdecadal increase of concurrent heatwaves and droughts over northeastern china both the time series of the predicted pinec figure s16 and the cross validation fitted pinec figure s17 well capture this interdecadal variation despite the good performance of the prediction model in predicting interdecadal variation and interannual variation during 1979 2018 the physical empirical prediction model performs well after 1997 but not for the period before 1996 figs 10 11 previous studies have suggested that the atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo may account for this interdecadal change around the late 1990 s li et al 2018a li et al 2020a which could be the possible reason why the performance of this physical empirical prediction model improves significantly after 1997 further in depth studies are necessary to explore the interdecadal prediction of pinec and possible amo impacts on pinec additionally previous studies have revealed that the variations of the pacific decadal oscillation pdo may regulate drought events across china yang et al 2018 song and wang 2020 wei et al 2021 besides fig 6 indicates that the negative sst anomalies in the equatorial atlantic ocean in april are significantly correlated to the concurrent heatwave and droughts in northeastern china these negative sst anomalies emerge about two months later than that in the pacific ocean which emerge earlier in february thus the sst variations in the atlantic ocean e g atlantic nino may also regulate the concurrent heatwave and droughts in northeastern china which deserve further investigations therefore the inclusion of atlantic sst anomalies pdo and amo in the prediction model can possibly improve the prediction skill of the concurrent heatwave and droughts in northeastern china credit authorship contribution statement huixin li conceptualization methodology software formal analysis investigation writing original draft bo
