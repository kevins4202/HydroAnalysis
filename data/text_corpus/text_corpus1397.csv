6985,the use of radar rainfall estimates has been limited by the lack of a reliable method of obtaining operationally accurate radar based rainfall estimates and the associated potential errors embedded in the retrieval process moreover the existing approaches have difficulty merging ground and radar based measurements due to spatial and temporal variations in bias as well as the uncertainties in model parameters that also can affect the overall bias this study proposes a novel approach for radar rainfall estimates using a hierarchical bayesian model hbm in the context of bias correction in particular three different variations i e the partial pooling model ppm complete pooling model cpm no pooling model npm of the hbm are explored to better characterize the bias correction factor and the associated uncertainty in the case of the cpm rain gauges are assumed to have a constant bias level over the spatial domain which results in a significant increase in rmse conversely in the npm approach the parameters are independently estimated for each station resulting in an increase in the uncertainty of the parameters caused by compensating for the estimates of other parameters this approach also leads to a substantial increase in the rmse here we introduce the ppm approach which aims to jointly estimate correction factors across all gauging stations while considering the covariance structure of both parameters and model errors the results obtained for the ppm show a noticeable reduction in the uncertainty of the parameters when compared to that of the npm we also note a decline in the bias of radar rainfall estimates finally we further utilize the proposed ppm based bias correction approach as an ensemble generator for simulation of radar rainfall estimates the simulated rainfall ensembles can satisfactorily reproduce key statistical properties retrieved from ground reference measurements keywords bias correction radar rainfall hierarchical bayesian model uncertainty and ensemble simulator 1 introduction the korean peninsula extends about 1100 km southward from the eastern part of the asian continent with a width of roughly 300 km more than 60 of the land is mountainous especially in the northern and eastern regions of the peninsula hence sub catchment areas are generally less than 500 km2 and times of concentration are very short due to the steep slopes korea is part of the east asia monsoon system and receives about two thirds of its annual precipitation over the summer season between late june and early september kwon et al 2016 lee et al 2012 a marked spatio temporal variation in precipitation has been observed with complex spatial patterns resulting from the interaction of rainfall with the topography the flood warning system which largely depends on ground rain gauges may be inadequate in areas where there is large spatial variability in precipitation jayakrishnan et al 2004 moreover precipitation forecasts of numerical weather prediction models are often poor especially in mountainous areas mendes and marengo 2010 schwitalla et al 2008 it is therefore difficult to predict and manage potential risks associated with floods and their consequences in south korea in this context weather radar provides many advantages over ground based rain gauges for instance weather radar can remotely estimate both precipitation and wind with high spatio temporal resolution and in regions where no ground based data is available such as oceans this information can be used to improve the flood modeling process and early warning system more specifically weather radar offers the advantage of being able to continuously detect rainfall events over a relatively large area in real time and document spatial rainfall patterns over unmonitored watersheds flash flood forecasts may benefit from weather radar due to its ability to quickly determine the spatial distribution of a storm over the area of interest although the use of weather radar has many advantages it is widely recognized that the direct use of weather radar precipitation data in hydrologic models is complicated by systematic bias in radar measurements bárdossy and pegram 2017 biggs and atkinson 2011 seo 1998 seo et al 1999 here systematic bias can be defined as the consistent underestimation or overestimation of rainfall estimates einfalt et al 2004 therefore correcting the systematic error or bias of radar data has been crucial to the use of radar based precipitation in conjunction with hydrologic models yoo et al 2014 errors are typically reduced by merging radar measurements with ground based rainfall estimates einfalt et al 2004 in addition to systematic error there are many different types of errors associated with the radar measurement including nonlinearity between the echo intensity and the rain drops berne and uijlenhoet 2005 kummerow 1998 lafont and guillemet 2004 sassi et al 2014 errors between the precipitation intensity and the radar reflectivity anagnostou et al 1998 steiner et al 1999 villarini and krajewski 2010a 2010b errors associated with the curvature of the earth s surface in a remote location from the radar site joss et al 1990 yoo et al 2014 yoo et al 2010 and range dependent bias related to systematic bias in space borga and tonelli 2000 chumchean et al 2004 fulton et al 1998 seo et al 2000 zhang et al 2014 a number of approaches to bias correction have been explored chumchean et al 2004 chumchean et al 2006 dai et al 2015 goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 harrison et al 2000 hasan et al 2014 rabiei and haberlandt 2015 seo and breidenbach 2002a thorndahl et al 2014 todini 2001 the gauge radar gr ratio approach has been the most commonly used method for correcting the systematic bias of radar precipitation data the gr ratio can be defined as the ratio of gauge precipitation to radar precipitation and several variations and applications of the gr ratio approach have been presented over the last several decades anagnostou et al 1998 anagnostou et al 1999 borga and tonelli 2000 chumchean et al 2006 collier 1986 habib et al 2008 hanchoowong et al 2012 he et al 2011 james et al 1993 smith and krajewski 1991 wilson 1970 yoo et al 2014 in view of the above this study also used the gr ratio approach to correct the systematic bias in part previous efforts have been fueled by the increased availability of radar data as well as the recognition of many potential applications in the field of hydrology however merging ground and radar based measurements is a very complicated problem due to the fact that the bias is a function of space and time seo et al 2000 and uncertainties in ground rain gauge measurements legates 2000 steiner et al 1999 villarini et al 2008 can affect the overall bias as well in these contexts this study proposes a novel approach intended to preserve common features across ground rainfall gauges and to estimate uncertainty in the context of the bias correction process within a bayesian modeling framework the existing bias correction approaches based on the gr ratio are routinely applied to radar gauge pairs that are pooled across all gauges located inside the area of interest which is termed as a complete pooling model cpm in the bayesian sense the cpm assumes that the same gr ratios apply to all gauges for a specific radar rain rate which excludes spatial variations among gauges devineni et al 2013 gelman 2006a specifically the cpm yields identical correction factors for all gauges which is especially inappropriate for the case where there is significant spatial variation in the bias level an alternative approach is to independently compute the gr ratio for each gauge location which is called a no pooling model npm from a bayesian inference point of view the npm treats each parameter as independent so that the model often overfits the data leading to implausibly high estimates where data is particularly insufficient devineni et al 2013 kim et al 2017 in other words uncertainties associated with the parameters i e gr ratios are relatively high in this study we propose a partial pooling model ppm to estimate gr ratios at multiple stations within a regression framework a radar rainfall ensemble generator is also developed using the posterior distributions of the gr ratios unlike the classical cpm and npm approaches the ppm provides more reasonable estimates in which the model parameters are jointly estimated across multiple locations by accounting for correlations of both parameters and residuals across rainfall gauges in this manner correlated radar measurements from different locations may provide information on the estimation of bias corrected rain rates by partial pooling of common information within a hierarchical bayesian model hbm framework hence the ppm approach theoretically yields lower uncertainty in parameter estimates by minimizing the independent parameters uncertainty in the bias corrected rain rates can in turn be reduced in a similar way devineni et al 2013 kim et al 2017 kwon et al 2011 ppm type models have been used recently to estimate parameters and their uncertainties in hydrologic studies of extreme events kwon et al 2008a kwon and lall 2016 kwon et al 2016 lima et al 2016a lima and lall 2009a lima et al 2015 najafi and moradkhani 2014 renard and lall 2014 sun et al 2015 however the use of bayesian models for bias correction has not been well established in radar hydrology there have been limited studies in the context of bayesian modeling of radar measurements hossain et al 2004 seo and smith 1991 todini 2001 and the bayesian models used in these studies are not equivalent to the one proposed in this study here we attempt to use the existing formulation of gr methods instead of modifying their functional forms and employ a hierarchical partial pooling approach for the estimation of parameters i e gr ratio within a bayesian framework in this section we provided a brief overview of the past research ground rainfall data and radar measurements are summarized in the following section and theoretical aspects of hierarchical modeling framework are described in section 3 the results obtained from this study are presented and discussed in section 4 finally we offer a summary and concluding remarks 2 weather radar and rain gauges 2 1 weather radar measurement the korea meteorological administration kma began the installation of its first modern weather radar on mt kwanak in 1969 during the late 1980s the government established a national weather doppler radar network covering the entire korean peninsula and 11 s band weather radars are currently operated by kma in this study the osungsan radar 36 00 46 126 47 03 was used to validate the proposed bias correction scheme the original osungsan c band radar was installed in 1991 to monitor precipitation on the west coast of the korean peninsula in 2007 it was replaced by an s band weather radar which offers more accurate precipitation estimates recently dual polarization radar was adopted to improve the accuracy of precipitation estimates in south korea detailed specifications of the osungsan weather radar station are presented in table 1 the open radar product generator orpg of the kma weather radar network has been used in conjunction with a fuzzy quality control algorithm fqca to minimize error associated with radar reflectivity jain et al 1997 kim et al 2015 this study used the 1 5 km cappi constant altitude plan position indicator data of the number of storms recorded by the osungsan radar at gunsan south korea during 2008 2016 and the corresponding hourly rainfall time series obtained from a set of ground rain gauges within a 100 km radius the use of the 1 5 km cappi reflectivity data is commonly acknowledged to improve the quality of the radar measurement particularly for the bright band yoo et al 2016 although there are different rainfall mechanisms the z r radar reflectivity to rain rate relationship used to quantitatively derive the rain rate mm hr is typically based on the marshall palmer equation z 200 r 1 6 in south korea yoo et al 2016 in this study the radar rain rate averaged over adjacent pixels i e 3 km 3 km grid data centered on the location of the ground gauge of interest was used to account for oversampling of the reflectivity yielding spatially inconsistent rain rates barrick 1979 horritt et al 2001 kelly et al 2012 kitchen and blackall 1992 2 2 rain gauges the automated synoptic observing system asos operated and maintained by kma in south korea provides continuous real time weather information including temperature humidity wind direction air pressure and precipitation more than 90 asos units are currently in operation covering all of south korea systematic error in reflectivity measurement typically increases with distance from the weather radar station hence use of weather radar reflectivity measurements more than 100 km from the epicenter of the weather radar station may result in an increase in the uncertainty associated with the rainfall estimates kitchen et al 1994 krajewski et al 2010 tabary 2007 in this study hourly rainfall data were obtained for 15 stations within a 100 km radius of the osungsan weather radar for a period of nine years 2008 2016 the selected rain gauges are illustrated in table 2 and fig 1 3 theoretical backgrounds of bias correction methods in this section we first provide the theoretical backgrounds of the z r relationship and the mean field bias correction methods then we introduce the theoretical and mathematical background of the proposed partial pooling approach for the mean field bias correction 3 1 z r relationship and mean field bias correction the rain drop size distribution dsd has been considered to be a proxy measure for understanding the microstructure of rainfall as well as the precipitation process and the measured dsd generally is used to estimate the reflectivity the theoretical and empirical relationship between radar reflectivity and rainfall rate at the surface is a major concern in a wide range of hydro meteorological applications however it has been acknowledged that the relationship is largely nonlinear and often changes over time due to spatio temporal variation in dsd as a result it is difficult to identify a unique mathematical relationship between radar reflectivity and rainfall rate over the past three decades various attempts have been made to better describe the relationship between radar reflectivity and rainfall rate which is called the z r relationship liu et al 2001 rendon et al 2013 rosenfeld et al 1993 seo and breidenbach 2002b specifically z r relationships represent a dependency between the local rainfall rate at the surface and reflectivity measured from rainfall dsd the dsd was first explored and approximated by marshall marshall 1948 who described a relationship between the dsd and the rainfall intensity the form of z r relationships are commonly expressed by a power law regression as follows 1 z α r β where r is the rainfall rate at the surface and z is the radar reflectivity while α and β are regression parameters the parameters of the z r relationship can be obtained by minimizing the functional form e zr z α r β in the context of optimization using pairs of radar reflectivity and rainfall rate however the regression parameters α and β are routinely assumed in many countries to be 200 and 1 6 on the basis of the marshall and palmer z r relationship marshall and palmer 1948 such estimates have been adopted in south korea thus this study assumed the same relationship for subsequent analysis kozu et al 2005 lee and zawadzki 2005 villarini and krajewski 2010a after transforming the radar reflectivity into rainfall rate through the z r relationship systematic bias of radar data is still a major challenge for the use of radar based precipitation estimates in hydrologic applications the systematic bias is typically reduced by merging measurements from radar stations and rain gauges a mean field bias correction mfbc method based on the gr ratio has been applied widely as a quantitative precipitation estimation qpe approach in the field of hydrology the gr ratio in the mfbc is a factor representing the mean field bias of radar measurement against the rainfall rate at the surface specifically the gr ratio is a mean radar bias factor which can be defined as the ratio of the sum of observed rainfall rates to the sum of radar rainfall estimates for all gauges as written in eq 2 krajewski et al 2010 lee and seo 2014 seo and smith 1991 smith and krajewski 1991 2 gr r a t i o s 1 m i 1 n r i s s 1 m i 1 n r e i s where r is the rainfall rate at the surface and re is the radar rainfall estimate derived from the z r relationship while n and m are the number of total data samples and the number of stations within a given radius of the weather radar respectively if the ratio is equal to one there is no difference between the radar rainfall estimate and the observed rainfall rate if the ratio is between zero and one the radar overestimates the observed rainfall and may not be sufficiently precise at that level of resolution conversely if the ratio is greater than one the radar underestimates the observed rainfall such underestimation is the most common type of bias in radar rainfall estimates borga 2002 germann and joss 2002 hossain et al 2004 indeed radar tends to underestimate the observed rainfall over much of south korea so that the estimated gr ratio is generally greater than one more generally the gr ratio is estimated by pooling all information across all gauges located inside the area of interest the same correction factor is applied to all gauges which may not be appropriate in cases where there are relatively large spatial variations in the bias level over the region of interest on the other hand if spatial variations of the bias are relatively smaller the same correction factor across all gauges can be effective in the following section we introduce a new approach for the mfbc based on a hierarchical bayesian framework which intends to represent more effectively the systematic bias over the entire region of interest 3 2 hierarchical bayesian models recently the hbm has been recognized as an alternative approach to the estimation of model parameters for integrating different sub models in the field of hydrology particularly when several different sources of observed data are available bazin et al 2010 gelman 2006b kwon et al 2008b lima and lall 2009a royle and dorazio 2008 as illustrated in the introduction the hbms considered in this study can be classified into three sub model types cpm ppm and npm the hbm allows pooling of available information across rain gauges for regression on available radar rainfall estimates and takes into account the covariance structure of model residuals across rain gauges from the bayesian perspective the gr ratio in the mfbc is typically obtained by pooling radar gauge pairs over the entire watershed which can be regarded as a cpm in that the same gr ratio is applied to all rain gauges in this sense spatial variation across rain gauges may not be considered and a homogeneous bias field is assumed over the entire basin conversely an independent estimation of the gr ratio for each station i e npm can lead to an increase in the uncertainty of estimates or equivalently to a loss of generalization due to overfitting it is possible to minimize the overfitting problem by explicitly considering the dependence of the parameters using covariance functions wang et al 2009 yu et al 2004 this study introduces a ppm to the mfbc which is designed to reduce uncertainty associated with parameters by jointly estimating the gr ratio under consideration of the covariance functions for the parameters and the model residuals in this section a general hbm structure is first introduced and the hbm is further extended to the mfbc for radar rainfall rates we employ the bayesian theorem to estimate a set of parameters and their uncertainty in this study the posterior distribution p θ r of the set of parameters θ can be formulated as the product of the prior distribution p θ and the likelihood p r θ 3 p θ r p θ p r θ p r p θ p r θ where r is the data vector and θ is the parameter vector to be fitted here we present the theoretical details of the models listed above motivated by bayesian considerations in the context of bias correction for radar rainfall estimates it should be noted that the full covariance matrix of model residuals over the gauging station is obtained through the modeling process and explicitly used to model spatially correlated random fields for the four models i e m1 m2 m3 and m4 considered in this study apart from m4 the other three models form a generalized log linear model with an intercept term that can be treated as a mean additive bias the cpm without the intercept term m4 is simply equal to the gr ratio in the traditional mfbc approach except for the bayesian parameter estimation here the m4 is then used as a baseline for a comparison of the results obtained with the three different bias correction analyses the bias correction factor is typically in the form of the ratio of the rain gauge rates to the radar rainfall estimate rather than the difference between radar gauge pairs assuming lognormal distributions for both rain rates thus the log transformation of the data is justified and attempted prior to the analysis 3 2 1 m1 ppm based bias correction model the ppm based bias correction model m1 can be written as eq 4 under the assumption of a multivariate normal distribution mvn for r s t this study takes the form of a generalized log linear regression to correlate the rain gauge rate r s t with the radar rainfall estimate r e s t at station s for time t after log transformation 4 r s t mvn α s r e s t β s σ ε t 1 n s 1 m θ μ θ σ θ mvn μ θ σ θ α s β s m v n μ θ μ α μ β σ θ here θ is the parameter vector to be estimated in this study a vector of intercepts α s can be interpreted as the mean bias for each station for a given vector re of the radar rainfall estimates while a vector of regression coefficients βs for the respective radar rainfall estimates re can be viewed as the bias correction ratio the σ ε represents a covariance matrix of the model residuals which is obtained through the modeling process so that correlated errors are explicitly considered in other words spatial dependency of the errors across rain gauges is modeled through the 15 15 covariance matrix σ ε on the other hand it should be reasonable to assume that the regression parameters i e α and β for a given radar rainfall estimate are similar across the fifteen rain gauging stations the similarities or dependencies have a relatively large effect on the reduction of uncertainty associated with parameters from a bayesian standpoint the ppm approach rests on the notion that hbm can effectively estimate parameters and reduce the associated uncertainty by pooling all of the rainfall data over the entire range of stations more specifically a vector of the 30 parameters i e 2 regression parameters 15 rain gauges is assumed to be sampled from a mvn with a set of hyper parameters μ θ and σθ in the hbm framework here μ θ is a common mean which is comprised of two parameters i e μ α and μ β for each of the fifteen sites and σθ is a 2 2 covariance matrix of the common mean μ θ the proposed m1 model adopts partial pooling to shrink the individual estimates on the parameters α s β s for station s towards a common mean μ θ μ α μ β with covariance matrix σθ the hyper prior distribution of the m1 model can be specified as follows 5a σ ε i n v w i s h a r t ν 1 ψ 1 5b μ θ mvn 0 10 3 i 5c σ θ i n v w i s h a r t ν 2 ψ 2 conjugate distributions are probability distributions whose prior and posterior distributions are in the same family in particular conjugate distributions are advantageous for computational purposes a conjugate distribution of the multivariate normal distribution is the normal inverse wishart distribution for mathematical convenience we consider the inverse wishart distribution with degrees of freedom ν and scale matrix ψ as the conjugate prior for covariance matrix σ of the mvn here the scale matrix was modeled as a unit matrix i kim et al 2017 and the degrees of freedom ν 1 and ν 2 were typically chosen to be the number of the parameters the posterior distribution function p θ r for the ppm based bias correction approach can be formulated by combining the likelihood function and prior distributions as follows 6 p θ r s 1 m t 1 n mvn r s t α s r e s t β s σ ε i n v w i s h a r t σ ε ν 1 ψ 1 mvn θ μ θ σ θ n μ θ 0 10 3 i i n v w i s h a r t σ θ ν 2 ψ 2 3 2 2 m2 cpm based bias correction for the m2 model a vector of the intercept coefficients α s is assumed to be the same across stations and jointly obtained for all stations and the regression coefficient β is also presumed to be the same for all stations for a given radar rainfall estimate which does not allow changes in individual response to the radar rainfall estimates more generally the m2 model can be interpreted as the gr ratio in the traditional mfbc approach except for the intercept term the cpm based bias correction model m2 can be represented as equation 7 7 r s t mvn α r e s t β σ ε t 1 n s 1 m for a consistent comparison with the ppm approach the covariance of model residuals is specified by the inverse wishart distribution with ν 1 degrees of freedom and scale matrix ψ 1 in this study we considered weakly informative priors on the regression parameters using gaussian distributions with zero mean and small precision gelman 2006b kim et al 2017 8a σ ε i n v w i s h a r t ν 1 ψ 1 8b α n 0 10 3 8c β n 0 10 3 the joint posterior distribution function p θ r for the m2 model can be written as follows 9 p θ r s 1 m t 1 n m v n r s t α r e s t β σ ε i n v w i s h a r t σ ε ν 1 ψ 1 n α 0 10 3 n β 0 10 3 3 2 3 m3 npm based bias correction in the case of the no pooling model the regression coefficients are independently estimated for each gauging station from this perspective each parameter is treated as independent thus the uncertainties in the parameter estimates could be large leading to unreliable estimate in the context of sampling variability the npm based bias correction model m3 can be written as eq 10 10 r s t mvn α s r e s t β s σ ε t 1 n s 1 m again the covariance of model residuals is described by the inverse wishart distribution with the degree of freedom and scale matrix for a systematic comparison between the models considered in this study similar to the m2 model we assume weakly informative priors on the regression parameters α s and β s using gaussian distributions with zero mean and small precision gelman 2006b 11a α s n 0 10 3 11b β s n 0 10 3 11c σ ε i n v w i s h a r t ν 1 ψ 1 the joint posterior distribution function p θ r for the m3 model can

based bias correction model without intercept m4 can be written as equation 13 which is equivalent to the gr ratio in the traditional mfbc approach but with a bayesian parameter estimation the m4 model was used as a baseline model for a comparison between the three different cases and the covariance matrix of model errors is also included the regression coefficient β can be interpreted as the mean bias correction factor for all gauging stations for a given vector re of the radar rainfall estimates the model residuals are assumed to be gaussian with zero mean and covariance matrix σ ε so that correlated errors are explicitly considered 13 r s t mvn r e s t β σ ε t 1 n s 1 m in our case the sample size is large enough hourly rainfall sequences for 15 rain gauges to estimate a relatively small number of parameters in eq 13 in these contexts the prior distributions for the parameters β was given vague normal priors with a mean of 0 and a precision of 10 3 as suggested in the literature gelman 2006b 14a β n 0 10 3 14b σ ε i n v w i s h a r t ν 1 ψ 1 the mfbc posterior distribution function p θ r can be formulated as follows 15 p θ r s 1 m t 1 n m v n r s t r e s t β σ ε i n v w i s h a r t σ ε ν 1 ψ 1 n β 0 10 3 the parameters in the four different models illustrated in this study are obtained by maximizing the joint posterior likelihood function as described in eqs 6 9 12 and 15 using a markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach more specifically the gibbs sampling approach to mcmc gilks et al 1995 khalil et al 2007 lima et al 2016b marshall et al 2007 is employed along with the gelman rubin diagnostic value as a convergence measure gelman and rubin 1992 gibbs sampling has been shown to be a special case of the metropolis hastings mh algorithm which is widely used in bayesian analysis chib and greenberg 1995 the main advantage of gibbs sampling is that a complex multidimensional problem can be simplified by separating it into multiple low dimensional problems kim et al 2018 kwon et al 2016 kwon et al 2011 specifically the gibbs sampler divides the multidimensional parameter space into a set of blocks and then samples each block separately conditional on the previous values of the other blocks convergence is suggested by gelman rubin diagnostic values less than 1 2 after 50 000 iterations the gelman rubin convergence diagnostic was less than 1 2 for all parameters 4 results and discussion in this section the performance of the four models m1 m2 m3 and m4 is evaluated using the deviance information criteria dic and the degree of reduction in the uncertainty of the regression coefficients moreover validation tests using model efficiency measures under different models are carried out as noted in the previous sections systematic bias in radar measurements has been an issue of great concern in radar hydrology chumchean et al 2004 kirstetter et al 2012 various studies have attempted to correct systematic bias of radar data however most studies have focused on a limited number of rainfall events so that parameters may have been influenced by sampling error which may in turn have led to increased uncertainty in the estimation of parameters unlike previous case studies which have estimated bias correction factors using a limited number of rainfall events this study is based on relatively long term radar gauge pairs over the entire watershed during the 2008 2016 period first we compare model performance in terms of the reduction in the uncertainty of the model parameters over four different models i e m1 m2 m3 and m4 all regression parameters representing the bias correction factors of the radar rainfall estimates were estimated within a hbm framework and the uncertainty associated with parameters is characterized in terms of posterior distributions the posterior probability density function of model parameters defined in the previous section are estimated using the bayesian mcmc method the uncertainty of the parameter is greatly affected by a relationship between the radar rainfall estimates and the observed local rainfall rates at the surface this study considered radar gauge pairs for 15 rain gauges to build relationships by repetitively maximizing the likelihood with the predefined priors uncertainty over a set of parameters is illustrated graphically on a boxplot more specifically posterior distributions of the parameters are each summarized by boxplots and the interquartile range iqr between the 25th and 75th percentiles of the regression parameters is compared as seen in figs 2 and 3 the posterior distribution of the intercept α representing the mean bias for each station for the three models is illustrated in fig 2 the posterior distribution shows symmetry of the median within the iqr which indicates a normal distribution as defined by priors here m1 m2 and m3 stand for ppm cpm and npm respectively the m4 model is excluded due to the absence of the intercept in the formulation as illustrated in the previous section the intercept coefficients α s are assumed to differ across stations and are independently obtained for individual stations in m3 whereas the coefficients in m2 are assumed to be identical for all stations in contrast the m1 model employs a partial pooling approach to shrink the independent estimates toward a common mean μ α with covariance matrix σ θ of parameters α s and β s there are significant differences among the three concepts in both the graphical and quantitative aspects of the uncertainty range a relatively large uncertainty range over the intercept coefficient for m3 is clearly identified which is not fully covered in the range obtained from the other two i e m1 and m2 as shown in fig 2 the relatively large uncertainty in the intercept coefficients α s may be attributed to the compensation of the independent regression coefficients β s over all gauging stations for a given radar rainfall estimate which could lead to high variability in the intercept α s a large individual parameter range implies a correspondingly large uncertainty in the estimated rainfall and vice versa for m2 the same regression coefficient α is estimated by excluding the spatial variations over the entire watershed so that the variability in the parameter estimates could be small which may arise due to an increased sample size however the cpm based m2 approach could be inadequate for the large variations in bias level among stations conversely a significant reduction in the uncertainties in estimating the model parameter is clearly seen in the m1 model which is attributable to the increased similarity between the estimated parameters in fig 2 the iqr is directly compared between the m1 and m3 models here the pink dot dashed line denotes the iqr of m1 while the black dot dashed line represents that of m3 most interestingly the median values of m1 are quite similar to that of m3 however the uncertainty range of the posterior distribution is reduced by approximately 15 relative to that when the m3 bias correction schemes are used moreover there is a noticeable difference between m1 and m3 in terms of the iqr although the median values are quite similar to each other this suggests that uncertainty associated with the parameters can be significantly reduced if the covariance structure is explicitly considered as illustrated in the m1 model it should be noted that the covariance of model errors also was included for all models to exclude the effect of differences in the modeling process it can be seen that the mean bias estimated from the m1 model within a given radius of the weather radar is about 2 mm hour with reduced errors over all stations suggesting that the m1 model reasonably captures the regional distribution of the mean bias fig 3 shows the posterior distributions of the regression coefficients β s obtained from the four different models within a hbm framework the regression coefficients βs can be regarded as the bias correction ratio to the respective radar rainfall estimates here m4 denotes the cpm based bias correction model without intercept which is equivalent to the traditional mfbc approach the m2 and m4 models rest directly on the complete pooling approach in which the spatial variations on the correction ratio are ignored so that only a regression coefficient over the entire set of stations is provided for a specific radar rain rate in the cases of m2 and m4 the iqr of the posterior distribution is not comparable to the other two due to the fact that the sample data are pooled differently more specifically radar gauge pairs are pooled across all gauges so that the sample size is multiplied by the number of stations that are analyzed leading to a substantial reduction in the uncertainty associated with the sampling error however the estimated correction factor may not be sufficient to capture the spatial variation in the bias level over the entire watershed which may lead to increased variation in the context of model efficiency hence a larger range of bias is expected for the m2 and m4 models on the other hand the m1 and m3 models allow an independent estimation of the correction ratio for each gauging station thus a vector of regression coefficients βs are provided for each station as expected the iqr of m3 is much broader than that of m1 due to the independence assumption across the stations and the parameters the overall range of the posterior distribution in m1 i e partial pooling model is significantly reduced for all stations compared to that of m3 i e no pooling model moreover the substantial shrinkage of the iqr for some stations e g stations 2 5 7 and 14 is noticeable in m1 further we repeatedly draw parameters for the correction of radar rainfall estimates from the posterior distributions including the covariance matrices of the model parameters and residuals the corrected values are then used to compare the model performance using three different model efficiencies namely the mean absolute error mae the root mean squared error rmse and the bias as illustrated in fig 4 the rmse is the square root of the mean of squared differences between the bias corrected radar estimates and the rain rates at the surface whereas the mae is the average of the absolute values of the differences between the radar rainfall estimates and the observed rain rates both rmse and mae represent mean prediction error ranging from zero to infinity in units of the variable of interest on the other hand the bias is the expected value of the error which represents the difference between the estimated and true values unlike other methods the parameters in m3 i e no pooling model are independently estimated for each gauging station by minimizing the error in an average sense which is equivalent to the definition of the bias at the station level in this perspective the bias in m3 is expected to be smaller than the others but it does not necessarily indicate that m3 performs best in terms of all three criteria the overall performance of m1 is generally superior to that of m4 and comparable to those of m2 and m3 the bias corrected radar estimates obtained in the existing mfbc approach m4 become subject to a relatively large error compared to the three other approaches presented in this study apart from m4 the iqr of the mae over m1 m2 and m3 are comparable to each other whereas a reduction in the uncertainty range of rmse is clearly observed in m1 which is attributable to a reduction in the uncertainty of model parameters moreover although the median rmse values are similar to each other excluding that of m4 the uncertainty range differs significantly over the other three models i e m1 m2 and m3 a main difference between rmse and mae is that in the former the errors are squared before averaging over them this imposes a relatively high penalty on large error so that the rmse should be larger when particularly large errors are involved in the process of bias correction on the contrary mae is a linear measure of the sum of the errors which indicates the equally weighted average of errors hasan et al 2016a hasan et al 2016b model m2 gives higher bias compared to the other two methods i e m1 and m3 which may have influenced the rmse the distribution of the rmse for m2 is strongly negatively skewed which implies that large errors are likely to be introduced similarly a symmetric expansion of the uncertainty in the rmse is clearly seen in m3 therefore the partial pooling approach is capable of reducing uncertainty in parameter estimates by minimizing the number of independent parameters to be estimated and uncertainty in the bias corrected rain rates can in turn be reduced in a similar way to quantitatively compare the model performance across the four models we estimated the dic values using the posterior distributions of model parameters the dic is typically adopted for the selection of hbms and models with lower dic values are preferable to those with higher dic values spiegelhalter et al 2002 the dic value is the sum of two components the posterior mean of deviance estimated from d 2 l o g l and the effective number of parameters pd derived from the posterior distribution kwon and lall 2016 kwon et al 2016 the estimated parameters and their credible intervals with dic values for all four models are represented in table 3 among the four models the partial pooling based m1 7405 is preferred for a given dic value followed by m3 7415 m2 7495 and m4 7711 as indicated the covariance function within a hbm plays a crucial role in describing dependencies of the set of parameters and the model residuals over all stations in our study a multivariate normal distribution was used to obtain the covariance matrices for both the parameters and model errors we compared the covariance matrix of model errors between the m1 and m4 models as shown in fig 5 the covariance of model errors in m4 i e 0 81 on average is approximately 64 larger than that of m1 0 52 on average due to the lack of appropriate representation of the relationship between the radar rainfall estimates and the observed rainfalls ultimately the proposed hbm based bias correction methods can be integrated into an ensemble generator for simulation of the radar rainfall estimates by imposing the correlated model errors over the corrected radar rainfall estimates in this study the estimated posterior distributions including covariance matrices for m1 were further used to generate rainfall ensembles with similar statistical properties to those obtained from the ground reference measurements the stochastic ensembles of radar rainfall estimates were tested and validated under various rainfall events the ensemble simulation results with uncertainty bounds for two representative rainfall events are presented in fig 6 event a 21 04

m2 m3 and m4 as summarized in tables s2 s6 overall performance results show that the m1 model outperformed the other three models in most performance aspects 5 concluding remarks weather radar provides many advantages over ground based rain gauges leading to improvements in flood modeling and early warning systems specifically they allow reliable identification of continuous rainfall events over large areas in nearly real time and provide insight into spatial rainfall patterns over ungauged watersheds however the use of weather radar has been limited by the lack of a reliable method for obtaining operationally accurate radar based rainfall estimates and the associated potential errors embedded in the retrieval process for these reasons a number of bias correction methods have been employed to improve radar based rainfall estimates by removing biases including systematic and random errors among the various bias correction methods used the gr ratio has been used extensively to correct systematic bias of radar precipitation estimates however the existing approach is still problematic in merging ground and radar based measurements since bias is a function of space and time and the uncertainties in model parameters can affect overall bias as well thus the main objective of this study was to propose a partial pooling approach for statistical inferences on the posterior distribution of bias correction factors within a bayesian regression framework and to apply this approach to generate radar rainfall ensembles at multiple stations of interest the key findings obtained in this study are summarized as follows 1 this study introduced a novel approach to radar rainfall estimates motivated by a hierarchical bayesian consideration in the context of the bias correction in particular an exploration of three different variations i e ppm cpm and npm of the hbm representing different considerations of pooling of available information across rain gauges was intended to improve understanding and characterization of the bias correction factor and the associated uncertainty it was confirmed that the proposed methods could explicitly account for the covariance structure of model parameters and residuals 2 among the three variations of the hbm the gr approach in the mfbc can be regarded as the cpm from a bayesian perspective in this approach the same bias correction factor is applied to all rain gauges correspondingly the spatial variability of the bias over rain gauges is not permitted to impose different bias levels at different stations experimental studies demonstrated a noticeable increase in bias for the cpm resulting from uncertainty in the parameters associated with correction factors 3 in contrast the npm approach to the bias correction i e m3 allowed an independent estimation for each station which resulted in better performance in reducing overall bias levels than the cpm however this study confirmed that the cpm approach could lead to an increase in variability of the parameters by compensating for the estimates of other parameters because of the independent estimation of the correction factor for each station more specifically absence of the covariance structure in the process of parameter estimation turned out to be inadequate resulting in a substantial increase in the rmse 4 this study presented the ppm approach as an alternative method of bias correction i e m1 which aimed to reduce uncertainty associated with parameters by jointly estimating the correction factors across all stations under consideration of the covariance functions for the parameters and the model residuals the results obtained in this experimental study demonstrated a noticeable reduction in the uncertainty of the parameters compared to that of the npm i e m3 and the uncertainty of the bias corrected rainfall estimates can in turn be significantly reduced in a similar manner as shown by comparing the rmse and mae moreover it was confirmed that the partial pooling based m1 model was superior to the other models presented in this study for a given dic value 5 finally the proposed ppm based bias correction approach was further integrated into an ensemble generator for simulation of the radar rainfall estimates by utilizing the covariance function to identify correlated model errors it was clearly demonstrated that the simulated rainfall ensembles could reasonably reproduce statistical properties obtained from the ground reference measurements moreover the spatial correlation of hourly radar rainfall ensembles was well reproduced correctly representing areal rainfall over the entire basin which is a key parameter in the hydrological response to rainfall future work will incorporate the current modeling approach into a spatial modeling framework allowing us to simultaneously obtain bias correction factors over the entire watershed including ungauged areas by explicitly adopting geostatistical methods such as the kriging approach for interpolation of factors within the bias correction acknowledgments this research was supported by a grant 18awmp b127555 02 from the water

6985,the use of radar rainfall estimates has been limited by the lack of a reliable method of obtaining operationally accurate radar based rainfall estimates and the associated potential errors embedded in the retrieval process moreover the existing approaches have difficulty merging ground and radar based measurements due to spatial and temporal variations in bias as well as the uncertainties in model parameters that also can affect the overall bias this study proposes a novel approach for radar rainfall estimates using a hierarchical bayesian model hbm in the context of bias correction in particular three different variations i e the partial pooling model ppm complete pooling model cpm no pooling model npm of the hbm are explored to better characterize the bias correction factor and the associated uncertainty in the case of the cpm rain gauges are assumed to have a constant bias level over the spatial domain which results in a significant increase in rmse conversely in the npm approach the parameters are independently estimated for each station resulting in an increase in the uncertainty of the parameters caused by compensating for the estimates of other parameters this approach also leads to a substantial increase in the rmse here we introduce the ppm approach which aims to jointly estimate correction factors across all gauging stations while considering the covariance structure of both parameters and model errors the results obtained for the ppm show a noticeable reduction in the uncertainty of the parameters when compared to that of the npm we also note a decline in the bias of radar rainfall estimates finally we further utilize the proposed ppm based bias correction approach as an ensemble generator for simulation of radar rainfall estimates the simulated rainfall ensembles can satisfactorily reproduce key statistical properties retrieved from ground reference measurements keywords bias correction radar rainfall hierarchical bayesian model uncertainty and ensemble simulator 1 introduction the korean peninsula extends about 1100 km southward from the eastern part of the asian continent with a width of roughly 300 km more than 60 of the land is mountainous especially in the northern and eastern regions of the peninsula hence sub catchment areas are generally less than 500 km2 and times of concentration are very short due to the steep slopes korea is part of the east asia monsoon system and receives about two thirds of its annual precipitation over the summer season between late june and early september kwon et al 2016 lee et al 2012 a marked spatio temporal variation in precipitation has been observed with complex spatial patterns resulting from the interaction of rainfall with the topography the flood warning system which largely depends on ground rain gauges may be inadequate in areas where there is large spatial variability in precipitation jayakrishnan et al 2004 moreover precipitation forecasts of numerical weather prediction models are often poor especially in mountainous areas mendes and marengo 2010 schwitalla et al 2008 it is therefore difficult to predict and manage potential risks associated with floods and their consequences in south korea in this context weather radar provides many advantages over ground based rain gauges for instance weather radar can remotely estimate both precipitation and wind with high spatio temporal resolution and in regions where no ground based data is available such as oceans this information can be used to improve the flood modeling process and early warning system more specifically weather radar offers the advantage of being able to continuously detect rainfall events over a relatively large area in real time and document spatial rainfall patterns over unmonitored watersheds flash flood forecasts may benefit from weather radar due to its ability to quickly determine the spatial distribution of a storm over the area of interest although the use of weather radar has many advantages it is widely recognized that the direct use of weather radar precipitation data in hydrologic models is complicated by systematic bias in radar measurements bárdossy and pegram 2017 biggs and atkinson 2011 seo 1998 seo et al 1999 here systematic bias can be defined as the consistent underestimation or overestimation of rainfall estimates einfalt et al 2004 therefore correcting the systematic error or bias of radar data has been crucial to the use of radar based precipitation in conjunction with hydrologic models yoo et al 2014 errors are typically reduced by merging radar measurements with ground based rainfall estimates einfalt et al 2004 in addition to systematic error there are many different types of errors associated with the radar measurement including nonlinearity between the echo intensity and the rain drops berne and uijlenhoet 2005 kummerow 1998 lafont and guillemet 2004 sassi et al 2014 errors between the precipitation intensity and the radar reflectivity anagnostou et al 1998 steiner et al 1999 villarini and krajewski 2010a 2010b errors associated with the curvature of the earth s surface in a remote location from the radar site joss et al 1990 yoo et al 2014 yoo et al 2010 and range dependent bias related to systematic bias in space borga and tonelli 2000 chumchean et al 2004 fulton et al 1998 seo et al 2000 zhang et al 2014 a number of approaches to bias correction have been explored chumchean et al 2004 chumchean et al 2006 dai et al 2015 goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 harrison et al 2000 hasan et al 2014 rabiei and haberlandt 2015 seo and breidenbach 2002a thorndahl et al 2014 todini 2001 the gauge radar gr ratio approach has been the most commonly used method for correcting the systematic bias of radar precipitation data the gr ratio can be defined as the ratio of gauge precipitation to radar precipitation and several variations and applications of the gr ratio approach have been presented over the last several decades anagnostou et al 1998 anagnostou et al 1999 borga and tonelli 2000 chumchean et al 2006 collier 1986 habib et al 2008 hanchoowong et al 2012 he et al 2011 james et al 1993 smith and krajewski 1991 wilson 1970 yoo et al 2014 in view of the above this study also used the gr ratio approach to correct the systematic bias in part previous efforts have been fueled by the increased availability of radar data as well as the recognition of many potential applications in the field of hydrology however merging ground and radar based measurements is a very complicated problem due to the fact that the bias is a function of space and time seo et al 2000 and uncertainties in ground rain gauge measurements legates 2000 steiner et al 1999 villarini et al 2008 can affect the overall bias as well in these contexts this study proposes a novel approach intended to preserve common features across ground rainfall gauges and to estimate uncertainty in the context of the bias correction process within a bayesian modeling framework the existing bias correction approaches based on the gr ratio are routinely applied to radar gauge pairs that are pooled across all gauges located inside the area of interest which is termed as a complete pooling model cpm in the bayesian sense the cpm assumes that the same gr ratios apply to all gauges for a specific radar rain rate which excludes spatial variations among gauges devineni et al 2013 gelman 2006a specifically the cpm yields identical correction factors for all gauges which is especially inappropriate for the case where there is significant spatial variation in the bias level an alternative approach is to independently compute the gr ratio for each gauge location which is called a no pooling model npm from a bayesian inference point of view the npm treats each parameter as independent so that the model often overfits the data leading to implausibly high estimates where data is particularly insufficient devineni et al 2013 kim et al 2017 in other words uncertainties associated with the parameters i e gr ratios are relatively high in this study we propose a partial pooling model ppm to estimate gr ratios at multiple stations within a regression framework a radar rainfall ensemble generator is also developed using the posterior distributions of the gr ratios unlike the classical cpm and npm approaches the ppm provides more reasonable estimates in which the model parameters are jointly estimated across multiple locations by accounting for correlations of both parameters and residuals across rainfall gauges in this manner correlated radar measurements from different locations may provide information on the estimation of bias corrected rain rates by partial pooling of common information within a hierarchical bayesian model hbm framework hence the ppm approach theoretically yields lower uncertainty in parameter estimates by minimizing the independent parameters uncertainty in the bias corrected rain rates can in turn be reduced in a similar way devineni et al 2013 kim et al 2017 kwon et al 2011 ppm type models have been used recently to estimate parameters and their uncertainties in hydrologic studies of extreme events kwon et al 2008a kwon and lall 2016 kwon et al 2016 lima et al 2016a lima and lall 2009a lima et al 2015 najafi and moradkhani 2014 renard and lall 2014 sun et al 2015 however the use of bayesian models for bias correction has not been well established in radar hydrology there have been limited studies in the context of bayesian modeling of radar measurements hossain et al 2004 seo and smith 1991 todini 2001 and the bayesian models used in these studies are not equivalent to the one proposed in this study here we attempt to use the existing formulation of gr methods instead of modifying their functional forms and employ a hierarchical partial pooling approach for the estimation of parameters i e gr ratio within a bayesian framework in this section we provided a brief overview of the past research ground rainfall data and radar measurements are summarized in the following section and theoretical aspects of hierarchical modeling framework are described in section 3 the results obtained from this study are presented and discussed in section 4 finally we offer a summary and concluding remarks 2 weather radar and rain gauges 2 1 weather radar measurement the korea meteorological administration kma began the installation of its first modern weather radar on mt kwanak in 1969 during the late 1980s the government established a national weather doppler radar network covering the entire korean peninsula and 11 s band weather radars are currently operated by kma in this study the osungsan radar 36 00 46 126 47 03 was used to validate the proposed bias correction scheme the original osungsan c band radar was installed in 1991 to monitor precipitation on the west coast of the korean peninsula in 2007 it was replaced by an s band weather radar which offers more accurate precipitation estimates recently dual polarization radar was adopted to improve the accuracy of precipitation estimates in south korea detailed specifications of the osungsan weather radar station are presented in table 1 the open radar product generator orpg of the kma weather radar network has been used in conjunction with a fuzzy quality control algorithm fqca to minimize error associated with radar reflectivity jain et al 1997 kim et al 2015 this study used the 1 5 km cappi constant altitude plan position indicator data of the number of storms recorded by the osungsan radar at gunsan south korea during 2008 2016 and the corresponding hourly rainfall time series obtained from a set of ground rain gauges within a 100 km radius the use of the 1 5 km cappi reflectivity data is commonly acknowledged to improve the quality of the radar measurement particularly for the bright band yoo et al 2016 although there are different rainfall mechanisms the z r radar reflectivity to rain rate relationship used to quantitatively derive the rain rate mm hr is typically based on the marshall palmer equation z 200 r 1 6 in south korea yoo et al 2016 in this study the radar rain rate averaged over adjacent pixels i e 3 km 3 km grid data centered on the location of the ground gauge of interest was used to account for oversampling of the reflectivity yielding spatially inconsistent rain rates barrick 1979 horritt et al 2001 kelly et al 2012 kitchen and blackall 1992 2 2 rain gauges the automated synoptic observing system asos operated and maintained by kma in south korea provides continuous real time weather information including temperature humidity wind direction air pressure and precipitation more than 90 asos units are currently in operation covering all of south korea systematic error in reflectivity measurement typically increases with distance from the weather radar station hence use of weather radar reflectivity measurements more than 100 km from the epicenter of the weather radar station may result in an increase in the uncertainty associated with the rainfall estimates kitchen et al 1994 krajewski et al 2010 tabary 2007 in this study hourly rainfall data were obtained for 15 stations within a 100 km radius of the osungsan weather radar for a period of nine years 2008 2016 the selected rain gauges are illustrated in table 2 and fig 1 3 theoretical backgrounds of bias correction methods in this section we first provide the theoretical backgrounds of the z r relationship and the mean field bias correction methods then we introduce the theoretical and mathematical background of the proposed partial pooling approach for the mean field bias correction 3 1 z r relationship and mean field bias correction the rain drop size distribution dsd has been considered to be a proxy measure for understanding the microstructure of rainfall as well as the precipitation process and the measured dsd generally is used to estimate the reflectivity the theoretical and empirical relationship between radar reflectivity and rainfall rate at the surface is a major concern in a wide range of hydro meteorological applications however it has been acknowledged that the relationship is largely nonlinear and often changes over time due to spatio temporal variation in dsd as a result it is difficult to identify a unique mathematical relationship between radar reflectivity and rainfall rate over the past three decades various attempts have been made to better describe the relationship between radar reflectivity and rainfall rate which is called the z r relationship liu et al 2001 rendon et al 2013 rosenfeld et al 1993 seo and breidenbach 2002b specifically z r relationships represent a dependency between the local rainfall rate at the surface and reflectivity measured from rainfall dsd the dsd was first explored and approximated by marshall marshall 1948 who described a relationship between the dsd and the rainfall intensity the form of z r relationships are commonly expressed by a power law regression as follows 1 z α r β where r is the rainfall rate at the surface and z is the radar reflectivity while α and β are regression parameters the parameters of the z r relationship can be obtained by minimizing the functional form e zr z α r β in the context of optimization using pairs of radar reflectivity and rainfall rate however the regression parameters α and β are routinely assumed in many countries to be 200 and 1 6 on the basis of the marshall and palmer z r relationship marshall and palmer 1948 such estimates have been adopted in south korea thus this study assumed the same relationship for subsequent analysis kozu et al 2005 lee and zawadzki 2005 villarini and krajewski 2010a after transforming the radar reflectivity into rainfall rate through the z r relationship systematic bias of radar data is still a major challenge for the use of radar based precipitation estimates in hydrologic applications the systematic bias is typically reduced by merging measurements from radar stations and rain gauges a mean field bias correction mfbc method based on the gr ratio has been applied widely as a quantitative precipitation estimation qpe approach in the field of hydrology the gr ratio in the mfbc is a factor representing the mean field bias of radar measurement against the rainfall rate at the surface specifically the gr ratio is a mean radar bias factor which can be defined as the ratio of the sum of observed rainfall rates to the sum of radar rainfall estimates for all gauges as written in eq 2 krajewski et al 2010 lee and seo 2014 seo and smith 1991 smith and krajewski 1991 2 gr r a t i o s 1 m i 1 n r i s s 1 m i 1 n r e i s where r is the rainfall rate at the surface and re is the radar rainfall estimate derived from the z r relationship while n and m are the number of total data samples and the number of stations within a given radius of the weather radar respectively if the ratio is equal to one there is no difference between the radar rainfall estimate and the observed rainfall rate if the ratio is between zero and one the radar overestimates the observed rainfall and may not be sufficiently precise at that level of resolution conversely if the ratio is greater than one the radar underestimates the observed rainfall such underestimation is the most common type of bias in radar rainfall estimates borga 2002 germann and joss 2002 hossain et al 2004 indeed radar tends to underestimate the observed rainfall over much of south korea so that the estimated gr ratio is generally greater than one more generally the gr ratio is estimated by pooling all information across all gauges located inside the area of interest the same correction factor is applied to all gauges which may not be appropriate in cases where there are relatively large spatial variations in the bias level over the region of interest on the other hand if spatial variations of the bias are relatively smaller the same correction factor across all gauges can be effective in the following section we introduce a new approach for the mfbc based on a hierarchical bayesian framework which intends to represent more effectively the systematic bias over the entire region of interest 3 2 hierarchical bayesian models recently the hbm has been recognized as an alternative approach to the estimation of model parameters for integrating different sub models in the field of hydrology particularly when several different sources of observed data are available bazin et al 2010 gelman 2006b kwon et al 2008b lima and lall 2009a royle and dorazio 2008 as illustrated in the introduction the hbms considered in this study can be classified into three sub model types cpm ppm and npm the hbm allows pooling of available information across rain gauges for regression on available radar rainfall estimates and takes into account the covariance structure of model residuals across rain gauges from the bayesian perspective the gr ratio in the mfbc is typically obtained by pooling radar gauge pairs over the entire watershed which can be regarded as a cpm in that the same gr ratio is applied to all rain gauges in this sense spatial variation across rain gauges may not be considered and a homogeneous bias field is assumed over the entire basin conversely an independent estimation of the gr ratio for each station i e npm can lead to an increase in the uncertainty of estimates or equivalently to a loss of generalization due to overfitting it is possible to minimize the overfitting problem by explicitly considering the dependence of the parameters using covariance functions wang et al 2009 yu et al 2004 this study introduces a ppm to the mfbc which is designed to reduce uncertainty associated with parameters by jointly estimating the gr ratio under consideration of the covariance functions for the parameters and the model residuals in this section a general hbm structure is first introduced and the hbm is further extended to the mfbc for radar rainfall rates we employ the bayesian theorem to estimate a set of parameters and their uncertainty in this study the posterior distribution p θ r of the set of parameters θ can be formulated as the product of the prior distribution p θ and the likelihood p r θ 3 p θ r p θ p r θ p r p θ p r θ where r is the data vector and θ is the parameter vector to be fitted here we present the theoretical details of the models listed above motivated by bayesian considerations in the context of bias correction for radar rainfall estimates it should be noted that the full covariance matrix of model residuals over the gauging station is obtained through the modeling process and explicitly used to model spatially correlated random fields for the four models i e m1 m2 m3 and m4 considered in this study apart from m4 the other three models form a generalized log linear model with an intercept term that can be treated as a mean additive bias the cpm without the intercept term m4 is simply equal to the gr ratio in the traditional mfbc approach except for the bayesian parameter estimation here the m4 is then used as a baseline for a comparison of the results obtained with the three different bias correction analyses the bias correction factor is typically in the form of the ratio of the rain gauge rates to the radar rainfall estimate rather than the difference between radar gauge pairs assuming lognormal distributions for both rain rates thus the log transformation of the data is justified and attempted prior to the analysis 3 2 1 m1 ppm based bias correction model the ppm based bias correction model m1 can be written as eq 4 under the assumption of a multivariate normal distribution mvn for r s t this study takes the form of a generalized log linear regression to correlate the rain gauge rate r s t with the radar rainfall estimate r e s t at station s for time t after log transformation 4 r s t mvn α s r e s t β s σ ε t 1 n s 1 m θ μ θ σ θ mvn μ θ σ θ α s β s m v n μ θ μ α μ β σ θ here θ is the parameter vector to be estimated in this study a vector of intercepts α s can be interpreted as the mean bias for each station for a given vector re of the radar rainfall estimates while a vector of regression coefficients βs for the respective radar rainfall estimates re can be viewed as the bias correction ratio the σ ε represents a covariance matrix of the model residuals which is obtained through the modeling process so that correlated errors are explicitly considered in other words spatial dependency of the errors across rain gauges is modeled through the 15 15 covariance matrix σ ε on the other hand it should be reasonable to assume that the regression parameters i e α and β for a given radar rainfall estimate are similar across the fifteen rain gauging stations the similarities or dependencies have a relatively large effect on the reduction of uncertainty associated with parameters from a bayesian standpoint the ppm approach rests on the notion that hbm can effectively estimate parameters and reduce the associated uncertainty by pooling all of the rainfall data over the entire range of stations more specifically a vector of the 30 parameters i e 2 regression parameters 15 rain gauges is assumed to be sampled from a mvn with a set of hyper parameters μ θ and σθ in the hbm framework here μ θ is a common mean which is comprised of two parameters i e μ α and μ β for each of the fifteen sites and σθ is a 2 2 covariance matrix of the common mean μ θ the proposed m1 model adopts partial pooling to shrink the individual estimates on the parameters α s β s for station s towards a common mean μ θ μ α μ β with covariance matrix σθ the hyper prior distribution of the m1 model can be specified as follows 5a σ ε i n v w i s h a r t ν 1 ψ 1 5b μ θ mvn 0 10 3 i 5c σ θ i n v w i s h a r t ν

purposes a conjugate distribution of the multivariate normal distribution is the normal inverse wishart distribution for mathematical convenience we consider the inverse wishart distribution with degrees of freedom ν and scale matrix ψ as the conjugate prior for covariance matrix σ of the mvn here the scale matrix was modeled as a unit matrix i kim et al 2017 and the degrees of freedom ν 1 and ν 2 were typically chosen to be the number of the parameters the posterior distribution function p θ r for the ppm based bias correction approach can be formulated by combining the likelihood function

bias correction for the m2 model a vector of the intercept coefficients α s is assumed to be the same across stations and jointly obtained for all stations and the regression coefficient β is also presumed to be the same for all stations for a given radar rainfall estimate which does not allow changes in individual response to the radar rainfall estimates more generally the m2 model can be interpreted as the gr ratio in the traditional mfbc approach except for the intercept term the cpm based bias correction model m2 can be represented as equation 7 7 r s t mvn α r e s t β σ ε t 1 n s 1

model was used as a baseline model for a comparison between the three different cases and the covariance matrix of model errors is also included the regression coefficient β can be interpreted as the mean bias correction factor for all gauging stations for a given vector re of the radar rainfall estimates the model residuals are assumed to be gaussian with zero mean and covariance matrix σ ε so that correlated errors are explicitly considered 13 r s t mvn r e s t β σ ε t 1 n s 1 m in our case the sample size is large enough hourly rainfall sequences for 15 rain gauges to estimate a

9 12 and 15 using a markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach more specifically the gibbs sampling approach to mcmc gilks et al 1995 khalil et al 2007 lima et al 2016b marshall et al 2007 is employed along with the gelman rubin diagnostic value as a convergence measure gelman and rubin 1992 gibbs sampling has been shown to be a special case of the metropolis hastings mh algorithm which is widely used in bayesian analysis chib and greenberg 1995 the main advantage of gibbs sampling is that a complex multidimensional problem can be simplified by separating it into multiple low dimensional problems kim et al 2018 kwon et al 2016 kwon et al 2011 specifically the gibbs sampler divides the multidimensional parameter space into a set of blocks and then samples each block separately conditional on the previous values of the other blocks convergence is suggested by gelman rubin diagnostic values less than 1 2 after 50 000 iterations the gelman rubin convergence diagnostic was less than 1 2 for all parameters 4 results and discussion in this section the performance of the four models m1 m2 m3 and m4 is evaluated using the deviance information criteria dic and the degree of reduction in the uncertainty of the regression coefficients moreover validation tests using model efficiency measures under different models are carried out as noted in the previous sections systematic bias in radar measurements has been an issue of great concern in radar hydrology chumchean et al 2004 kirstetter et al 2012 various studies have attempted to correct systematic bias of radar data however most studies have focused on a limited number of rainfall events so that parameters may have been influenced by sampling error which may in turn have led to increased uncertainty in the estimation of parameters unlike previous case studies which have estimated bias correction factors using a limited number of rainfall events this study is based on relatively long term radar gauge pairs over the entire watershed during the 2008 2016 period first we compare model performance in terms of the reduction in the uncertainty of the model parameters over four different models i e m1 m2 m3 and m4 all regression parameters representing the bias correction factors of the radar rainfall estimates were estimated within a hbm framework and the uncertainty associated with parameters is characterized in terms of posterior distributions the posterior probability density function of model parameters defined in the previous section are estimated using the bayesian mcmc method the uncertainty of the parameter is greatly affected by a relationship between the radar rainfall estimates and the observed local rainfall rates at the surface this study considered radar gauge pairs for 15 rain gauges to build relationships by repetitively maximizing the likelihood with the predefined priors uncertainty over a set of parameters is illustrated graphically on a boxplot more specifically posterior distributions of the parameters are each summarized by boxplots and the interquartile range iqr between the 25th and 75th percentiles of the regression parameters is compared as seen in figs 2 and 3 the posterior distribution of the intercept α representing the mean bias for each station for the three models is illustrated in fig 2 the posterior distribution shows symmetry of the median within the iqr which indicates a normal distribution as defined by priors here m1 m2 and m3 stand for ppm cpm and npm respectively the m4 model is excluded due to the absence of the intercept in the formulation as illustrated in the previous section the intercept coefficients α s are assumed to differ across stations and are independently obtained for individual stations in m3 whereas the coefficients in m2 are assumed to be identical for all stations in contrast the m1 model employs a partial pooling approach to shrink the independent estimates toward a common mean μ α with covariance matrix σ θ of parameters α s and β s there are significant differences among the three concepts in both the graphical and quantitative aspects of the uncertainty range a relatively large uncertainty range over the intercept coefficient for m3 is clearly identified which is not fully covered in the range obtained from the other two i e m1 and m2 as shown in fig 2 the relatively large uncertainty in the intercept coefficients α s may be attributed to the compensation of the independent regression coefficients β s over all gauging stations for a given radar rainfall estimate which could lead to high variability in the intercept α s a large individual parameter range implies a correspondingly large uncertainty in the estimated rainfall and vice versa for m2 the same regression coefficient α is estimated by excluding the spatial variations over the entire watershed so that the variability in the parameter estimates could be small which may arise due to an increased sample size however the cpm based m2 approach could be inadequate for the large variations in bias level among stations conversely a significant reduction in the uncertainties in estimating the model parameter is clearly seen in the m1 model which is attributable to the increased similarity between the estimated parameters in fig 2 the iqr is directly compared between the m1 and m3 models here the pink dot dashed line denotes the iqr of m1 while the black dot dashed line represents that of m3 most interestingly the median values of m1 are quite similar to that of m3 however the uncertainty range of the posterior distribution is reduced by approximately 15 relative to that when the m3 bias correction schemes are used moreover there is a noticeable difference between m1 and m3 in terms of the iqr although the median values are quite similar to each other this suggests that uncertainty associated with the parameters can be significantly reduced if the covariance structure is explicitly considered as illustrated in the m1 model it should be noted that the covariance of model errors also was included for all models to exclude the effect of differences in the modeling process it can be seen that the mean bias estimated from the m1 model within a given radius of the weather radar is about 2 mm hour with reduced errors over all stations suggesting that the m1 model reasonably captures the regional distribution of the mean bias fig 3 shows the posterior distributions of the regression coefficients β s obtained from the four different models within a hbm framework the regression coefficients βs can be regarded as the bias correction ratio to the respective radar rainfall estimates here m4 denotes the cpm based bias correction model without intercept which is equivalent to the traditional mfbc approach the m2 and m4 models rest directly on the complete pooling approach in which the spatial variations on the correction ratio are ignored so that only a regression coefficient over the entire set of stations is provided for a specific radar rain rate in the cases of m2 and m4 the iqr of the posterior distribution is not comparable to the other two due to the fact that the sample data are pooled differently more specifically radar gauge pairs are pooled across all gauges so that the sample size is multiplied by the number of stations that are analyzed leading to a substantial reduction in the uncertainty associated with the sampling error however the estimated correction factor may not be sufficient to capture the spatial variation in the bias level over the entire watershed which may lead to increased variation in the context of model efficiency hence a larger range of bias is expected for the m2 and m4 models on the other hand the m1 and m3 models allow an independent estimation of the correction ratio for each gauging station thus a vector of regression coefficients βs are provided for each station as expected the iqr of m3 is much broader than that of m1 due to the independence assumption across the stations and the parameters the overall range of the posterior distribution in m1 i e partial pooling model is significantly reduced for all stations compared to that of m3 i e no pooling model moreover the substantial shrinkage of the iqr for some stations e g stations 2 5 7 and 14 is noticeable in m1 further we repeatedly draw parameters for the correction of radar rainfall estimates from the posterior distributions including the covariance matrices of the model parameters and residuals the corrected values are then used to compare the model performance using three different model efficiencies namely the mean absolute error mae the root mean squared error rmse and the bias as illustrated in fig 4 the rmse is the square root of the mean of squared differences between the bias corrected radar estimates and the rain rates at the surface whereas the mae is the average of the absolute values of the differences between the radar rainfall estimates and the observed rain rates both rmse and mae represent mean prediction error ranging from zero to infinity in units of the variable of interest on the other hand the bias is the expected value of the error which represents the difference between the estimated and true values unlike other methods the parameters in m3 i e no pooling model are independently estimated for each gauging station by minimizing the error in an average sense which is equivalent to the definition of the bias at the station level in this perspective the bias in m3 is expected to be smaller than the others but it does not necessarily indicate that m3 performs best in terms of all three criteria the overall performance of m1 is generally superior to that of m4 and comparable to those of m2 and m3 the bias corrected radar estimates obtained in the existing mfbc approach m4 become subject to a relatively large error compared to the three other approaches presented in this study apart from m4 the iqr of the mae over m1 m2 and m3 are comparable to each other whereas a reduction in the uncertainty range of rmse is clearly observed in m1 which is attributable to a reduction in the uncertainty of model parameters moreover although the median rmse values are similar to each other excluding that of m4 the uncertainty range differs significantly over the other three models i e m1 m2 and m3 a main difference between rmse and mae is that in the former the errors are squared before averaging over them this imposes a relatively high penalty on large error so that the rmse should be larger when particularly large errors are involved in the process of bias correction on the contrary mae is a linear measure of the sum of the errors which indicates the equally weighted average of errors hasan et al 2016a hasan et al 2016b model m2 gives higher bias compared to the other two methods i e m1 and m3 which may have influenced the rmse the distribution of the rmse for m2 is strongly negatively skewed which implies that large errors are likely to be introduced similarly a symmetric expansion of the uncertainty in the rmse is clearly seen in m3 therefore the partial pooling approach is capable of reducing uncertainty in parameter estimates by minimizing the number of independent parameters to be estimated and uncertainty in the bias corrected rain rates can in turn be reduced in a similar way to quantitatively compare the model performance across the four models we estimated the dic values using the posterior distributions of model parameters the dic is typically adopted for the selection of hbms and models with lower dic values are preferable to those with higher dic values spiegelhalter et al 2002 the dic value is the sum of two components the posterior mean of deviance estimated from d 2 l o g l and the effective number of parameters pd derived from the posterior distribution kwon and lall 2016 kwon et al 2016 the estimated parameters and their credible intervals with dic values for all four models are represented in table 3 among the four models the partial pooling based m1 7405 is preferred for a given dic value followed by m3 7415 m2 7495 and m4 7711 as indicated the covariance function within a hbm plays a crucial role in describing dependencies of the set of parameters and the model residuals over all stations in our study a multivariate normal distribution was used to obtain the covariance matrices for both the parameters and model errors we compared the covariance matrix of model errors between the m1 and m4 models as shown in fig 5 the covariance of model errors in m4 i e 0 81 on average is approximately 64 larger than that of m1 0 52 on average due to the lack of appropriate representation of the relationship between the radar rainfall estimates and the observed rainfalls ultimately the proposed hbm based bias correction methods can be integrated into an ensemble generator for simulation of the radar rainfall estimates by imposing the correlated model errors over the corrected radar rainfall estimates in this study the estimated posterior distributions including covariance matrices for m1 were further used to generate rainfall ensembles with similar statistical properties to those obtained from the ground reference measurements the stochastic ensembles of radar rainfall estimates were tested and validated under various rainfall events the ensemble simulation results with uncertainty bounds for two representative rainfall events are presented in fig 6 event a 21 04

rainfalls moreover the observed rainfalls largely fall within the 95 credible intervals for all stations given these results it was concluded that the proposed model can largely reproduce the observed rainfall however the results show that a few large discrepancies during the monsoon season can lead to a significant increase in rmse therefore there is a need to further improve the current modeling

m2 m3 and m4 as summarized in tables s2 s6 overall performance results show that the m1 model outperformed the other three models in most performance aspects 5 concluding remarks weather radar provides many advantages over ground based rain gauges leading to improvements in flood modeling and early warning systems specifically they allow reliable identification of continuous rainfall events over large areas in nearly real time and provide insight into spatial rainfall patterns over ungauged watersheds however the use of weather radar has been limited by the lack of a reliable method for obtaining operationally accurate radar based rainfall estimates and the associated potential errors embedded in the retrieval process for these reasons a number of bias correction methods have been employed to improve radar based rainfall estimates by removing biases including systematic and random errors among the various bias correction methods used the gr ratio has been used extensively to correct systematic bias of radar precipitation estimates however the existing approach is still problematic in merging ground and radar based measurements since bias is a function of space and time and the uncertainties in model parameters can affect overall bias as well thus the main objective of this study was to propose a partial pooling approach for statistical inferences on the posterior distribution of bias correction factors within a bayesian regression framework and to apply this approach to generate radar rainfall ensembles at multiple stations of interest the key findings obtained in this study are summarized as follows 1 this study introduced a novel approach to radar rainfall estimates motivated by a hierarchical bayesian consideration in the context of the bias correction in particular an exploration of three different variations i e ppm cpm and npm of the hbm representing different considerations of pooling of available information across rain gauges was intended to improve understanding and characterization of the bias correction factor and the associated uncertainty it was confirmed that the proposed methods could explicitly account for the covariance structure of model parameters and residuals 2 among the three variations of the hbm the gr approach in the mfbc can be regarded as the cpm from a bayesian perspective in this approach the same bias correction factor is applied to all rain gauges correspondingly the spatial variability of the bias over rain gauges is not permitted to impose different bias levels at different stations experimental studies demonstrated a noticeable increase in bias for the cpm resulting from uncertainty in the parameters associated with correction factors 3 in contrast the npm approach to the bias correction i e m3 allowed an independent estimation for each station which resulted in better performance in reducing overall bias levels than the cpm however this study confirmed that the cpm approach could lead to an increase in variability of the parameters by compensating for the estimates of other parameters because of the independent estimation of the correction factor for each station more specifically absence of the covariance structure in the process of parameter estimation turned out to be inadequate resulting in a substantial increase in the rmse 4 this study presented the ppm approach as an alternative method of bias correction i e m1 which aimed to reduce uncertainty associated with parameters by jointly estimating the correction factors across all stations under consideration of the covariance functions for the parameters and the model residuals the results obtained in this experimental study demonstrated a noticeable reduction in the uncertainty of the parameters compared to that of the npm i e m3 and the uncertainty of the bias corrected rainfall estimates can in turn be significantly reduced in a similar manner as shown by comparing the rmse and mae moreover it was confirmed that the partial pooling based m1 model was superior to the other models presented in this study for a given dic value 5 finally the proposed ppm based bias correction approach was further integrated into an ensemble generator for simulation of the radar rainfall estimates by utilizing the covariance function to identify correlated model errors it was clearly demonstrated that the simulated rainfall ensembles could reasonably reproduce statistical properties obtained from the ground reference measurements moreover the spatial correlation of hourly radar rainfall ensembles was well reproduced correctly representing areal rainfall over the entire basin which is a key parameter in the hydrological response to rainfall future work will incorporate the current modeling approach into a spatial modeling framework allowing us to simultaneously obtain bias correction factors over the entire watershed including ungauged areas by explicitly adopting geostatistical methods such as the kriging approach for interpolation of factors within the bias correction acknowledgments this research was supported by a grant 18awmp b127555 02 from the water

brush layering bischetti et al 2010 brush mattress allen and fischenich 2000 and biosolids meyer et al 2004 are among the common measures used against erosion however the protection is not immediate as plantings require establishment time meanwhile all bank protection schemes involving vegetation require considerable care in handling and their survival depends on the time of installation sedimentation competition with other plants and predation shields et al 1995 shields et al 2008 wu et al 2014 there are still uncertainties related to dynamic nature of bioengineered works e g seasonal change in root distribution decay of untreated wood used in the design which prohibit a universal design standard tardío and mickovski 2016 in addition the vegetation has a net negative impact on stability in cases where the surcharge exerted by vegetative biomass outweighs the relative increase in cohesion due to root reinforcement van de wiel and darby 2007 establishing plants in coarse gravely material and especially in sections below baseflow elevation of the stream to prevent undercutting of the bank is difficult usda 1996 therefore stream restoration practices often require in situ reconstruction of streambanks in the absence of stabilizing vegetation lindow et al 2009 structural measures of fibrous streambank protection applications including fiber roll blankets beighley and valdes 2009 and erosion control fabrics geotextile mats bhattacharyya et al 2010 have emerged in recent years due to their relatively faster construction and cost effective features soil bioengineering systems and structural measures of fibrous streambank protection may often be used in combination for restoration of streambanks li et al 2006 the inclusion of randomly distributed discrete fibers natural or man made in soils exhibit similar improvements in shear resistance and stability as vegetative plantings or bioengineered systems diambra et al 2010 divya et al 2014 laboratory experiments showed that natural fibers such as coir fiber ranged from 40 mm to 60 mm in length with gravimetric content ranged from 0 to 1 5 increased the piping resistance babu and vasudevan 2008 whereas oil palm empty fruit bunch fiber 15 mm 30 mm and 45 mm in length with gravimetric content of 0 25 and 0 5 increased the shear strength of the soil ahmad et al 2010 man made fibers such as glass fibers ranged from 10 mm to 15 mm in length with gravimetric content of 0 25 introduced an apparent cohesion intercept to the soil in the dry state which remained almost unchanged with increasing water content this suggested that the apparent cohesion of fiber reinforced sand was independent of water content lovisa et al 2010 polypropylene pp fibers one of the most widely reported fibers in the literature increased the peak shear strength and cohesion in which the optimum fiber 25 mm in length content was reported to be 0 3 nataraj and mcmanis 1997 the use of pp fibers 24 mm in length with gravimetric content of 0 5 introduced an additional 15 kpa of cohesion in sand consoli et al 2007 whereas the inclusion of pp fibers 25 mm and 50 mm in length with gravimetric content of 0 05 0 10 and 0 15 improved piping resistance das and viswanadham 2010 fibers are considered as an admixture in soil improvement projects for increasing the bearing capacity and the shear resistance of in situ soil field placement of fibers can be done using conventional construction equipment e g rotary mixer to mix the fibers within the soil which can then be compacted using standard soil compaction methods li 2005 or by spreading the soil and the fibers in a sandwich pattern and mixing them with a rotary tiller falorca et al 2011 for example pp fibers intermixed into a soil mass were considered as a novel soil stabilization technology for the construction of contingency airfields with the advantages of being low cost easily transportable rapidly installed and structurally stable for long periods of time ahlrich and tidwell 1994 they concluded that fibers with a length of 12 mm at gravimetric fiber content of 0 5 exhibited higher gyratory shear strength values than the unreinforced sand fiber reinforcement is a promising alternative in projects involving localized repair of slopes li and zornberg 2013 for example pp fiber inclusion with gravimetric fiber content of 3 6 kg m3 was considered as a remediation method for a highway embankment slope slope ratio of 4 horizontal to 1 vertical for which gregory 2006 predicted potential progressive embankment slope failures during the design phase moreover collins et al 2015 utilized fibers 25 76 mm pp fibers with gravimetric fiber content of 0 5 to control soil erosion of highway side slopes consisting of non cohesive soil during rainfall immediately after completion of construction stabilization by fiber reinforcement facilitates the quick establishment of vegetation thus minimizes sediment runoff to streams eab et al 2014 showed that mixing 10 mm long polyester fiber into the soil gravimetric fiber content of 2 0 prevented the collapse of the bare slope during laboratory tests conducted under a rainfall simulator even though the use of fibers demonstrated an increase in soil shear resistance by laboratory tests and field applications artificially reinforcing slopes by fiber inclusion has not been implemented for stream restoration works due to lack of information on their performance under seepage in order to reveal insights into the behavior of fiber reinforced sandy slopes subjected to seepage flow akay et al 2016 2018 demonstrated the favorable effect of pp fiber inclusions fiber length 6 mm 12 mm gravimetric content 0 3 1 0 on seepage induced progressive slope failures by the use of two dimensional 2d physical slope models however due to the dimensions 100 cm long 20 cm wide and 55 cm high of their small scale 2d slopes the seepage flow rates could not represent field conditions moreover their analyses were limited to calculating the global factor of safety fs of the reinforced slopes using the piezometric pressures within the slope and strength parameters of the soil fiber composite they reported fs values less than 1 0 for unreinforced bare slope experiments around 2 0 for slopes with 6 mm 0 3 fiber content and around 6 0 for slopes with 6 mm 1 0 fiber content however calculation of the global factor of safety only reflects the safety against rotational deep seated failures due to this limitation small scale sapping failures observed on the slope surfaces with 6 mm 0 3 fiber content could not be predicted by slope stability analysis the current study investigates the seepage erosion process during laboratory fiber reinforced slope experiments using a larger scale three dimensional 3d erosion flume 195 cm long 100 cm wide and 110 cm high so that in situ seepage hydraulic gradients observed in the field could be generated within the slope at laboratory conditions the susceptibility of reinforced slopes to seepage erosion was quantified by relating fiber content to seepage erosion volumes this study utilized 3d laser scanning to calculate the erosion volumes e v in order to quantify the improvement of fiber inclusion at 0 3 and 1 0 contents 3d laser scanning of the topography permitted erosion rate e kg s calculations which were further utilized in a sediment transport function for seepage erosion introduced by fox et al 2006 the physical and piezometric pressure conditions of reinforced sand slope physical experiments were compared to those of bare slope experiments conducted by akay and özer 2018 in addition triaxial compression tests and hydraulic tests were conducted on sand fiber reinforced cores fiber gravimetric content ranged from 0 0 to 1 0 to determine the additional cohesion due to fiber reinforcement cf and to identify unsaturated retention characteristics respectively lastly sediment discharge and seepage flow discharge data were used to determine the empirical coefficients of a dimensionless seepage erosion sediment transport model 2 materials and methods two streambank models were constructed inside an erosion flume with dimensions of 195 cm long 100 cm wide and 110 cm high with a slope angle of 45 by packing soil in 5 cm lifts fig 1 during the compaction effort special attention was given to avoid any visible gap between the erosion flume wall and compacted soil which would otherwise cause preferential flow along the soil wall interface non cohesive and well drained sand was chosen as the streambank soil the material properties of the non cohesive sand are given in table 1 in order to mimic the root reinforcement of plant vegetation discrete pp fiber model m06 by polyfibers istanbul turkey with a length of 6 mm was added into sand fig 2 a the material properties of the fiber are given in table 2 the tensile strength ts of the pp fiber ts 350 mpa is within the same order of magnitude as the strength of most single root specimens for example preti and giadrossich 2009 developed a regression equation of ts versus root diameter after 98 tests on spanish broom single roots which gives a ts of 108 mpa corresponding to 32 μm the equivalent diameter deq of the pp fiber used in this study table 2 pp fibers were added into moist sand gravimetric moisture content of the sand ranged from 0 08 to 0 10 by a rotary mixer fig 2b visual examinations showed that gravimetric moisture content of 0 1 prevented segregation of monofilament fibers and facilitated homogeneous mixture fig 2c the fiber contents ratio of dry weight of fiber to dry weight of sand of the two models were selected as 0 3 and 1 0 following the hydraulic and triaxial compression tests conducted on sand fiber mixture core samples discussed in the following section which were prepared with gravimetric fiber content wf ranging from 0 0 to 1 0 the dry unit weight of the bare streambank model was 14 kn m3 the porosity of the model was 0 45 the composite unit weight was 14 04 kn m3 and 14 14 kn m3 for models with 0 3 and 1 0 fiber content respectively constant head permeability tests astm 2006 were conducted on 55 samples with sand dry unit weight of 14 kn m3 of which the gravimetric fiber content wf ranged from 0 0 to 1 0 5 samples for each fiber content in order to reveal any differences in saturated hydraulic conductivity between various fiber contents in order to define the unsaturated flow characteristics of the fiber reinforced sand water retention tests on sand with fiber content wf ranged from 0 0 to 1 0 were conducted following the procedure introduced by akay et al 2013 the matric suction ψ of 11 core samples 6 4 cm long 7 26 cm diameter was measured by a tensiometer during a wetting process in which the volumetric water content θ of the initially dry sample was increased by adding 5 mg of water at certain intervals equilibrium condition should be reached before the next dosage until the cores reached saturation the computer controlled triaxial tests astm 2011 were conducted on sand fiber composite samples 14 5 cm long 7 3 cm diameter with fiber contents of 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 in order to determine the additional cohesion due to fiber reinforcement cf the triaxial compression test specimens were compacted to a sand dry unit weight of 14 kn m3 the fiber reinforced specimens were prepared by hand mixing dry sand water 10 of the weight of the sand and pp fibers each streambank model was tested under two different seepage hydraulic gradients by maintaining piezometric heads of 50 cm h2o and 100 cm h2o in the upstream section of the erosion flume where a constant level reservoir was located fig 1 the experiments started at the time water was supplied to the reservoir during the experiments the time seepage flow emerged on the streambank slope surface was recorded time of seepage ts positive pore water pressures developed within the streambank models were measured at 120 s intervals by three vibrating wire vw piezometers model 52610520 by durham geo slope indicator stone mountain georgia usa placed inside the slope elevation z 10 cm following the installation of the second layer during construction fig 1 in addition 13 tensiometers model cl 029b by soil measurement systems tucson arizona usa were placed on one side of the erosion flume to measure negative matric suction and positive pore water pressures developed near the wall section fig 1 the location of t4 t8 and t11 allowed a direct comparison of pressure heads measured by p1 p2 and p3 respectively which had the same x and z coordinates fig 1c and e each tensiometer was connected to a bi directional pressure transducer model asdxrrx005pdaa5 by honeywell sensing and control golden valley minnesota usa that transmitted the acquired data at 10 s intervals to a datalogger model cr1000 with am16 32 multiplexer and avw200 vw interface by campbell scientific logan utah usa which was previously used by akay et al 2013 2014a b 2016 2018 özer et al 2014 akay 2016 özer 2016 and akay and özer 2018 the experiments were terminated when the piezometric pressures measured by vw piezometers and tensiometers reached steady state in addition to the use of digital photography to document the physical condition of the slopes this study implemented three dimensional 3d laser scanning to measure the volume of erosion due to seepage ground based laser scanner lidar pizzuto et al 2010 and terrestrial laser scanning tls resop and hession 2010 has been used during streambank profile surveys to monitor bank retreat in the field laser scanning technology was used for obtaining three dimensional coordinates of the eroded bank surface with dimensions of 25 cm by 50 cm chu agor et al 2008 for scanning the topography of the erosion flume surface with dimensions of 650 cm by 136 cm aksoy et al 2012 and for calculating the volume of erosion of the bank with dimensions of 110 cm by 100 cm akay and özer 2018 during scaled physical laboratory experiments laboratory studies also utilized particle image velocimetry piv techniques to quantify spatially explicit bank deformation fields samadi et al 2013 and kinect photogrametric technology for measuring riverbank variations masoodi et al 2018 this study conducted laser scanning by a handheld laser scanner model freestyle3d by faro lake mary fl usa which created 3d point clouds with 0 2 mm resolution and 1 5 mm accuracy the point clouds were then processed by 2 5d volume calculation tool within cloudcompare open source software cloudcompare 2018 which has been utilized for measuring distances between two different point clouds esposito et al 2017 and for digitization of geological structures thiele et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydraulic tests the average saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat of the bare sand sample wf 0 0 was 1 5 10 4 m s with a sample standard deviation s of 0 11 10 4 m s the saturated hydraulic conductivity remained almost the same in the fiber content ranged from 0 0 to 0 5 table 3 however it started to decrease as the fiber content increased from 0 5 to 1 0 the average saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat of the sand with 1 0 fiber content reduced to 0 9 10 4 m s with a sample standard deviation s of 0 09 10 4 m s table 3 the inverse correlation between k sat or seepage velocity and wf was also reported earlier by babu and vasudevan 2008 for a similar soil sand reinforced with natural coir fibers the matric suction ψ and volumetric water content θ pairs of 11 samples are presented in fig 3 the retention curves for the data pairs with fiber content wf of 0 0 and 1 0 were fitted by the retc retention curve computer code van genuchten et al 1991 using the van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 4 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 5 m 1 1 n n 1 where h ψ is the pore water pressure head θs is the saturated water content θr is the residual water content α is the inverse of the air entry pressure bubbling pressure n is the pore size distribution index based on the curve fit of which the r 2 value for the regression of measured versus fitted values was 0 92 the van genuchten parameters of the bare sand wf 0 0 were θs 0 45 θr 0 0 α 0 06 cm 1 and n 2 69 table 1 and fig 3 the visual inspection of the spread of the data pairs showed that the inclusion of the discrete random pp fibers with the content range from 0 1 to 1 0 did not show an effect on the retention parameters of the bare sand the van genuchten parameters of the sand with the highest fiber content wf 1 0 was similar to that of the bare sand r 2 0 94 θs 0 45 θr 0 04 α 0 07 cm 1 and n 2 69 fig 3 the negligible increase in residual water content parameter θr of the fiber reinforced sand with 1 0 fiber content was attributed to the presence of fibers that provided additional contact area for the water molecules which increased the water holding capacity at higher matric suction 3 2 triaxial compression tests the triaxial compression tests results along with the tests conducted by akay et al 2018 with fiber contents of 0 0 bare sand 0 1 0 3 0 6 and 1 0 are given in table 4 additional fiber cohesion cf manifested itself even at fiber content as low as 0 2 with a value of 3 0 kpa since the effective cohesion c of the bare sand was zero table 1 eq 2 was rewritten for fiber reinforced sand as follows 6 τ c f σ u w tan ϕ where c in eq 2 was replaced by cf which depends on the fiber content table 4 however the increase in cf with wf was intermittent as the effective friction angle ϕ of the failure envelope also had an impact on the value of cf for example cf decreased from 3 0 kpa to 1 6 kpa conversely ϕ increased from 29 5 to 31 2 when wf increased from 0 2 to 0 3 moreover cf increased from 1 6 kpa to 5 7 kpa conversely ϕ decreased from 31 2 to 28 9 when wf increased from 0 3 to 0 4 the fluctuations in cf and ϕ with increase in wf continued until the strength parameters reached the values of 6 2 kpa and 32 5 for wf equal to 1 0 table 4 the range of cf 0 6 2 kpa found in this study is similar to the cohesion due to fibrous roots

longleaf pine 6 0 kpa 3 3 physical model experiments bare slope experiments conducted earlier by akay and özer 2018 showed the progress of slope erosion under groundwater seepage flow for example following the seepage flow emergence on the slope surface at t 98 min time of seepage after the start of the experiment under 50 cm h2o piezometric head bc seepage flow entrapped soil particles on the slope surface and the cavity formed due to erosion reached to an elevation of 30 cm on the slope surface 16 min after the time of seepage fig 4 a the top elevation of the cavity due to seepage erosion increased to 40 cm and 55 cm at times t 132 min and 180 min respectively fig 4b and c the steady state seepage discharge q was 0 01 l s at the end of the bare slope experiment under 50 cm h2o piezometric head bc tensiometers t and piezometers p located along the bottom of the slope order from the inlet to the outlet t4 p1 t8 p2 t11 p3 t13 refer to fig 1c and e reached steady state with pore water pressure heads of 36 6 48 6 31 3 34 5 25 0 21 6 and 18 3 cm h2o respectively fig 5 a this resulted in a hydraulic gradient of 0 18 which was calculated by dividing the pressure head difference between t4 and t13 36 6 18 3 cm h2o by the distance in between 103 cm concurrently the seepage erosion ceased as the degraded slope material entrapped by the seepage flow accumulated at the toe of the slope where it acted as a buttress against seepage forces fig 4c this phenomenon was referred by midgley et al 2013 as self healing the inlet bc was then increased to 100 cm h2o piezometric head after a 4 day free drainage period due to higher seepage gradient the time of seepage reduced to 29 min fig 5b the top of the erosion cavity reached to elevations of 90 cm and 110 cm crest of the slope at t 36 min and t 42 min respectively fig 4d and e the steady state seepage discharge q was 0 034 l s the tensiometers and piezometers reached steady state at t 60 min fig 5b and similar to the situation observed under 50 cm h2o piezometric head bc self healing prevented the erosion progressing further into the slope fig 4f the inclusion of pp fiber into sand with a content of 0 3 increased the shear resistance fiber cohesion cf was equal to 1 6 kpa according to triaxial tests refer to table 4 against seepage forces compared to bare sand as the erosion cavity raised to the level of 24 cm on the slope surface 46 min after the time of seepage under 50 cm h2o piezometric head bc fig 6 a consistent to the fact found by hydraulic tests that the inclusion of fibers did not have a noticeable effect on k sat and water retention characteristics the time of seepage of the experiment 100 min remained approximately the same compared to bare sand slope experiment under 50 cm h2o piezometric head bc fig 7 a it should be noted here that the initial pore water condition of the slopes which was another factor that has an impact on the time of seepage was also similar since the volumetric water content of the sand during construction was maintained between 0 11 and 0 14 for example the initial pore water pressure condition of the slopes of bare sand and sand with 0 3 fiber content average of 13 tensiometers at t 0 was 36 8 and 42 7 cm h2o respectively figs 5a and 7a similar to the situation monitored during the bare sand slope experiment tensiometers and vw piezometers indicated the progress of phreatic surface from the inlet reservoir to the slope face as pore water pressures started to increase first at t4 p1 closest to the inlet and lastly at t13 closest to the slope surface fig 7a the close match between t4 p1 t8 p2 and t11 p3 indicated uniform flow conditions along the width of the erosion flume and also provided evidence for the non existence of a preferential flow along the interface between the model and the side wall of the erosion flume fig 7 the top of erosion cavity reached to an elevation of 30 cm and 34 cm on the slope surface at t 164 min and t 180 min end of experiment respectively fig 6b and c the steady state seepage discharge q was 0 011 l s the inlet bc was increased to 100 cm h2o piezometric head after a 10 day free drainage period of the slope the initial condition of the slope average of 13 tensiometers at the start of the experiment under 100 cm h2o piezometric head bc was 33 0 cm h2o however due to the higher gradient the time of seepage reduced to 28 min fig 7b the top of the erosion cavity reached to elevations of 44 cm and 67 cm at t 55 min and t 68 min respectively fig 6d and e the steady state seepage discharge q was 0 036 l s the experiment was terminated when the slope was self healed with a cavity elevation of 85 cm at t 120 min fig 6f the fiber cohesion cf of 6 2 kpa demonstrated a favorable effect as the slope with 1 0 fiber content effectively resisted the seepage forces which resulted in an elevation of only 6 cm for the top of erosion cavity at the end of the experiment t 180 min under 50 cm h2o piezometric head bc fig 8 a the time of seepage increased to 111 min even though the initial condition of 37 4 cm h2o was similar to other experiments this was due to the fact that the k sat value of 0 9 10 4 m s found during hydraulic tests on sand with 1 fiber content slowed down the progress of the phreatic front table 3 and fig 9 a on the other hand steady state pore water pressures developed at the end of the experiment within the slope remained similar to the bare sand slope as t4 p1 t8 p2 t11 p3 t13 recorded pore water pressure heads of 35 6 33 4 28 8 23 5 19 2 15 3 and 8 9 cm h2o respectively fig 9a the steady state seepage flow hydraulic gradient reached at the end of the experiment was then calculated as 0 26 the steady state seepage discharge q was 0 009 l s the inlet bc was increased to 100 cm h2o piezometric head after a 6 day free drainage of the slope the initial condition of the slope average of 13 tensiometers at the start of the experiment under 100 cm h2o piezometric head bc was 24 4 cm h2o and the time of seepage was 11 min fig 9b the steady state seepage discharge q was 0 033 l s the top of erosion cavity could only reach to an elevation of 12 cm at the end of the experiment fig 8b seepage erosion volumes e v m3 of the three slopes with fiber content of 0 0 0 3 and 1 0 were calculated by comparing point clouds obtained by 3d laser scanning of the slopes at times given in figs 4 6 and 8 to the point cloud of the original 45 slope at t 0 for example point clouds of the slope with 0 3 fiber content obtained by 3d laser scanning at t 0 original 45 slope and at t 7200 s end of experiment under 100 cm h2o piezometric head bc refer to fig 6f were superimposed in fig 10 a the side view in y direction clearly showed the eroded zone indicated by the triangle abc at the end of the experiment with respect to the original 45 slope fig 10a the total erosion volume e v m3 was calculated by the integration of raster cells the area of each cell was 0 005 m 0 005 m in xy plane where the height of each cell was equal to the elevation change δz in between the two point clouds fig 10b within the degradation scour zone δz had negative values minimum value of 0 476 m whereas in the accumulation zone δz had positive values maximum value of 0 232 m fig 10b the integration resulted in a value of 0 123 m3 for e v at the end of experiment with 0 3 fiber content under 100 cm h2o piezometric head bc fig 10 the e v values calculated at 3d laser scanning times of the two slopes with fiber content of 0 0 and 0 3 were given in table 5 since fiber inclusion 1 0 were able to protect the slope against seepage erosion entirely fig 8 3d laser scanning was conducted only at the end of experiments under 50 and 100 cm h2o piezometric head bc for which e v was calculated as zero not included in table 5 the e v values calculated at the end of experiments t t3 showed the reduction in total seepage erosion volume with increase in fiber content wf table 5 for example fiber inclusion of 0 3 resulted in a decrease from 0 049 m3 bare slope to 0 017 m3 35 reduction and from 0 259 m3 bare slope to 0 123 m3 47 reduction under 50 and 100 cm h2o piezometric head bc respectively table 5 in order to examine the strength of the relationship between seepage erosion and seepage discharge a prominent factor in seepage erosion seepage erosion rates e kg s were calculated as follows 7 e δ e v δ t ρ b where δ e v m3 is the volume of the seepage erosion that occurred during δ t s the time between two successive 3d laser scans the bulk density of the slope ρ b was 1427 kg m3 for example e was calculated as 0 010 kg s 0 007 m3 6840 s 5880 s 1427 kg m3 from the time of seepage to the time of first 3d laser scanning time interval of ts t1 during the bare slope experiment under 50 cm h2o piezometric head bc table 5 a power law relationship could then be constituted between seepage discharge q l s and seepage erosion rate e kg s 8 e a q b where the empirical regression parameters a and b were equal to 292 and 2 2 for the experiments with the bare sand slope and to 81 and 2 3 for the experiments with the sand slope with 0 3 fiber content the correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 91 for both bare sand and sand with 0 3 fiber content demonstrated a power law relationship between e and q using the limited number of data given in table 5 please note that sand with 1 0 fiber content was not included in the analysis as erosion volumes were zero during those experiments fig 8 seepage erosion rates e were then nondimensionalized in order to apply the sediment transport function for seepage erosion introduced by fox et al 2006 which was based on a power law relationship between the dimensionless sediment discharge q s and dimensionless seepage flow shear stress τ 9 q s a 1 τ b 1 where a1 and b1 are empirical regression parameters dimensionless sediment discharge q s and dimensionless seepage flow shear stress τ was calculated by the following equations given by howard and mclane 1988 and fox et al 2007b respectively 10 q s q sf ρ s 1 γ w d 3 1 2 11 τ q sin θ s 1 n k sat where q sf is the specific sediment discharge expressed as weight of solids per unit time per unit width i e equal to e 9 81 m s2 m ρ is the fluid density 1000 kg m3 s is the specific gravity of an individual sediment particle 2 65 γ w is the specific weight of the liquid 9810 n m3 d is the median grain diameter 0 39 mm q m s is the seepage discharge per unit flow area θ is the streambank angle 45 n is the porosity 0 45 and ksat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity 1 5 10 4 m s for the bare sand and 1 6 10 4 m s for the sand with 0 3 fiber content the calculated values of τ and q s were given in table 5 the regression parameters a and b were equal to 90 and 4 0 for the bare sand and to 25 and 5 4 for the sand with 0 3 fiber content respectively 4 conclusions high phreatic surface levels in the riparian zone following the rising limb of hydrographs initiate subsurface flow towards the streambank where it emerges on the surface as seepage flow which could cause erosion on the surface this study investigated the application of a fibrous streambank protection that used 6 mm long discrete pp fibers as a soil admixture the range of fiber cohesion cf of 0 6 kpa 6 2 kpa introduced by fiber inclusion showed that fibrous streambank protection was able to substitute the cohesion due to roots cr the cohesion due to the fiber inclusion cf mimicked the behavior of root reinforcement as the amount of erosion reduced with increase in fiber content wf hydraulic tests showed that the retention parameters of the sand reinforced with fiber at various contents were similar which explained the similarity of piezometric conditions among the physical streambank model experiments in addition constant head permeability tests showed a decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat with increase in wf as a result an increase in the time of seepage was observed during the experiments with wf 1 0 the scale of the erosion flume and the constructed streambank model of this study was able to replicate flow dynamics of field scale experiments as steady state seepage discharges q ranging from 0 009 l s to 0 036 l s and seepage erosion rates e ranging from 0 001 kg s to 0 262 kg s during laboratory experiments were similar to those of in situ seepage induced streambank erosion experiments conducted by midgley et al 2013 in which q and e was measured as high as 0 007 l s and 0 014 kg s respectively the use of point clouds obtained by 3d laser scanning was found to be effective in calculating the sediment erosion volume caused by seepage flow during experiments the seepage flow discharge q l s and seepage erosion rate e kg s had a power law relationship fibrous streambank protection with 0 3 fiber content inclusion reduced the total amount of seepage erosion by 35 and 47 under 50 and 100 cm h2o piezometric head boundary condition bc respectively fibrous streambank protection with 1 0 fiber content effectively prevented seepage erosion during streambank experiments future studies should include finer grained materials e g silt and clayey streambank materials to investigate the effect of fiber inclusion on seepage erosion mechanisms of cohesive soils in addition the effect of fiber inclusion length and composition type monofilament versus fibrillated on erosion process should be investigated acknowledgments this work was supported by the scientific and

6986,groundwater flow is one of the main driving factors in the erosion of streambanks particularly during return flow of bank storage as sediment particles on the bank face may be entrapped or liquefied by seepage flow into the stream and when acting in concert with fluvial forces previous research has mainly focused on seepage erosion mechanisms whereas in this study a remedial solution

m3 unit weight streambank models 45 bank slope with dimensions of 195 cm long 100 cm wide and 110 cm high were constructed in an erosion flume two different seepage gradients were generated within the streambanks by maintaining piezometric heads of 50 cm h2o and 100 cm h2o in the upstream section of the erosion flume during experiments models were equipped with vibrating wire piezometers to measure the pore water pressures within the streambank in addition tensiometers measured pore water pressures near the wall section erosion of sediment from the streambank initiated concurrently as seepage flow emerged on the bare streambank surface erosion volumes were computed by three dimensional laser scanning triaxial compression tests on sand samples fiber gravimetric content ranged from 0 to 1 0

streambank erosion and bank retreat is a significant threat to agricultural land and infrastructure shields et al 2009 in which weathering soil hydrology and fluvial hydraulics can interactively play roles luppi et al 2009 midgley et al 2012 rinaldi and nardi 2013 klavon et al 2017 streambank erosion is a significant source of the sediment load in many streams which may contribute up to 80 of the total sediment loading odgaard 1987 fox et al 2007a groundwater flow is counted as one of the main driving factors causing erosion of streambanks where increased piezometric pressure condition of the bank storage due to water infiltrated into unsaturated banks during the rising limb of hydrographs promotes return flow towards streams known as seepage flow hagerty 1991a b akay et al 2018 field observations show that seepage flow contributes significantly to streamflow particularly during the recession limb of stream hydrographs fox et al 2007a langendoen and simon 2008 rinaldi et al 2008 and could be in the range of 5 10 5 l s 0 011 l s wilson et al 2007 however seepage flow generally discharges to streams at focused as opposed to diffuse points which may influence sediment input to streams fox et al 2011 seepage flow is responsible for the streambank sediment input to streams through the mechanisms of internal erosion of soil pipes soil piping and seepage erosion fox and wilson 2010 masoodi et al 2017 wilson et al 2018 these processes may or may not coexist crosta and di prisco 1999 cavities formed by seepage erosion may also trigger cantilever type failures seepage undercutting of the overhanging portions of the streambank which further increases sediment loading fox et al 2006 dapporto et al 2001 streambank collapse mass or rotational planar failures and liquefaction pop out mass failures are additional mechanisms that contribute to the streambank sediment loading due to seepage fox and wilson 2010 recent research identified the prominent factors affecting the amount of seepage erosion with positive or negative correlation seepage gradient pore water pressure depth of undercutting bank slope cohesion of the soil and matric suction fox et al

with the effect of the uncertainties and the natural variability of geotechnical parameters should be considered samadi et al 2011 masoodi et al 2017 seepage flow emerges on the slope surface in saturated portions of the bank soil where soil pore water tension or the matric suction ψ defined by rinaldi and casagli 1999 as the difference between the pore air pressure ua generally assumed to be at zero gauge pressure and the pore water pressure uw becomes zero as a result the apparent cohesion ca of the unsaturated soil diminishes since it depends on the matric suction ψ and the suction friction angle ϕb by the following relationship wilson et al 2007 1 c a ψ tan ϕ b recent research has focused on the ways to increase the shear strength properties of the bank material in order to resist erosive forces e g fluvial tractive and groundwater seepage forces since it s known that apparent cohesion ca diminishes under saturated conditions which significantly reduces bank stability simon et al 2000 vandamme and zou 2013 the only way to improve resistance is to increase the effective cohesion of the material c as the shear strength τ of an unsaturated soil is represented by fredlund et al 1978 formulation 2 τ c σ u a tan ϕ c a where σ is the total normal stress and ϕ is the effective friction angle under saturated conditions ca is omitted and ua is replaced by uw non cohesive soils do not exhibit effective cohesion c under saturated conditions therefore they become susceptible to erosion under seepage flow wörman 1993 hagerty and parola 2001 ghiassian and ghareh 2008 it has been demonstrated through field and laboratory studies that vegetative plantings used during bioengineered restorations can supply the necessary increase in cohesion to resist erosive forces usda 1996 the effect of vegetation becomes obvious especially for ephemeral channels as the removal of bank vegetation results in extensive bank erosion and channel widening during extreme events simon and rinaldi 2000 curran and hession 2013 at a larger scale clearcutting of forests on steep hillslopes increases the frequency of both landslides and debris flows imaizumi and sidle 2012

brush layering bischetti et al 2010 brush mattress allen and fischenich 2000 and biosolids meyer et al 2004 are among the common measures used against erosion however the protection is not immediate as plantings require establishment time meanwhile all bank protection schemes involving vegetation require considerable care in handling and their survival depends on the time of installation

seasonal change in root distribution decay of untreated wood used in the design which prohibit a universal design standard tardío and mickovski 2016 in addition the vegetation has a net negative impact on stability in cases where the surcharge exerted by vegetative biomass outweighs the relative increase in cohesion due to root reinforcement van de wiel and darby 2007 establishing plants in coarse gravely material and especially in sections below baseflow elevation of the stream to prevent undercutting of the bank is difficult usda 1996 therefore stream restoration practices often require in situ reconstruction of streambanks in the absence of stabilizing vegetation lindow et al 2009 structural measures of fibrous streambank protection applications including fiber roll blankets beighley and valdes 2009 and erosion control fabrics geotextile mats bhattacharyya et al 2010 have emerged in recent years due to their relatively faster construction and cost effective features soil bioengineering systems and structural measures of fibrous streambank protection may often be used in combination for restoration of streambanks li et al 2006 the inclusion of randomly distributed discrete fibers natural or man made in soils exhibit similar improvements in shear resistance and stability as vegetative plantings or bioengineered systems diambra et al 2010 divya et al 2014 laboratory experiments showed that natural fibers such as coir fiber ranged from 40 mm to 60 mm in length with gravimetric content ranged from 0 to 1 5 increased the piping resistance babu and vasudevan 2008 whereas oil palm empty fruit bunch fiber 15 mm 30 mm and 45 mm in length with gravimetric content of 0 25 and 0 5 increased the shear strength of the soil ahmad et al 2010 man made fibers such as glass fibers ranged from 10 mm to 15 mm in length with gravimetric content of 0 25 introduced an apparent cohesion intercept to the soil in the dry state which remained almost unchanged with increasing water content this suggested that the apparent cohesion of fiber reinforced sand was independent of water content lovisa et al 2010 polypropylene pp fibers one of the most widely reported fibers in the literature increased the peak shear strength and cohesion in which the optimum fiber 25 mm in length content was reported to be 0 3 nataraj and mcmanis 1997 the use of pp fibers 24 mm in length with gravimetric content of 0 5 introduced an additional 15 kpa of cohesion in sand consoli et al 2007 whereas the inclusion of pp fibers 25 mm and 50 mm in length with gravimetric content of 0 05 0 10 and 0 15 improved piping resistance das and viswanadham 2010 fibers are considered as an admixture in soil improvement projects for increasing the bearing capacity and the shear resistance of in situ soil field placement of fibers can be done using conventional construction equipment e g rotary mixer to mix the fibers within the soil which can then be compacted using standard soil compaction methods li 2005 or by spreading the soil and the fibers in a sandwich pattern and mixing them with a rotary tiller falorca et al 2011 for example pp fibers intermixed into a soil mass were considered as a novel soil stabilization technology for the construction of contingency airfields with the advantages of being low cost easily transportable rapidly installed and structurally stable for long periods of time ahlrich and tidwell 1994 they concluded that fibers with a length of 12 mm at gravimetric fiber content of 0 5 exhibited higher gyratory shear strength values than the unreinforced sand fiber reinforcement is a promising alternative in projects involving localized repair of slopes li and zornberg 2013 for example pp fiber inclusion with gravimetric fiber content of 3 6 kg m3 was considered as a remediation method for a highway embankment slope slope ratio of 4 horizontal to 1 vertical for which gregory 2006 predicted potential progressive embankment slope failures during the design phase moreover collins et al 2015 utilized fibers 25 76 mm pp fibers with gravimetric fiber content of 0 5 to control soil erosion of highway side slopes consisting of non cohesive soil during rainfall immediately after completion of construction stabilization by fiber reinforcement facilitates the quick establishment of vegetation thus minimizes sediment runoff to streams eab et al 2014 showed that mixing 10 mm long polyester fiber into the soil gravimetric fiber content of 2 0 prevented the collapse of the bare slope during laboratory tests conducted under a rainfall simulator even though the use of fibers demonstrated an increase in soil shear resistance by laboratory tests and field applications artificially reinforcing slopes by fiber inclusion has not been implemented for stream restoration works due to lack of information on their performance under seepage in order to reveal insights into the behavior of fiber reinforced sandy slopes subjected to seepage flow akay et al 2016 2018 demonstrated the favorable effect of pp fiber inclusions fiber length 6 mm 12 mm gravimetric content 0 3 1 0 on seepage induced progressive slope failures by the use of two dimensional 2d physical slope models however due to the dimensions 100 cm long 20 cm wide and 55 cm high of their small scale 2d slopes the seepage flow rates could not represent field conditions moreover their analyses were limited to calculating the global factor of safety fs of the reinforced slopes using the piezometric pressures within the slope and strength parameters of the soil fiber composite they reported fs values less than 1 0 for unreinforced bare slope experiments around 2 0 for slopes with 6 mm 0 3 fiber content and around 6 0 for slopes with 6 mm 1 0 fiber content however calculation of the global factor of safety only reflects the safety against rotational deep seated failures due to this limitation small scale sapping failures observed on the slope surfaces with 6 mm 0 3 fiber content could not be predicted by slope stability analysis the current study investigates the seepage erosion process during laboratory fiber reinforced slope experiments using a larger scale three dimensional 3d erosion flume 195 cm long 100 cm wide and 110 cm high so that in situ seepage hydraulic gradients observed in the field could be generated within the slope at laboratory conditions the susceptibility of reinforced slopes to seepage erosion was quantified by relating fiber content to seepage erosion volumes this study utilized 3d laser scanning to calculate the erosion volumes e v in order to quantify the improvement of fiber inclusion at 0 3 and 1 0 contents 3d laser scanning of the topography permitted erosion rate e kg s calculations which were further utilized in a sediment transport function for seepage erosion introduced by fox et al 2006 the physical and piezometric pressure conditions of reinforced sand slope physical experiments were compared to those of bare slope experiments conducted by akay and özer 2018 in addition triaxial compression tests and hydraulic tests were conducted on sand fiber reinforced cores fiber gravimetric content ranged from 0 0 to 1 0 to determine the additional cohesion due to fiber reinforcement cf and to identify unsaturated retention characteristics respectively lastly sediment discharge and seepage flow discharge data were used to determine the empirical coefficients of a dimensionless seepage erosion sediment transport model 2 materials and methods two streambank models were constructed inside an erosion flume with dimensions of 195 cm long 100 cm wide and 110 cm high with a slope angle of 45 by packing soil in 5 cm lifts fig 1 during the compaction effort special attention was given to avoid any visible gap between the erosion flume wall and compacted soil which would otherwise cause preferential flow along the soil wall interface non cohesive and well drained sand was chosen as the streambank soil the material properties of the non cohesive sand are given in table 1 in order to mimic the root reinforcement of plant vegetation discrete pp fiber model m06 by polyfibers istanbul turkey with a length of 6 mm was added into sand fig 2 a the material properties of the fiber are given in table 2 the tensile strength ts of the pp fiber ts 350 mpa is within the same order of magnitude as the strength of most single root specimens for example preti and giadrossich 2009 developed a regression equation of ts versus root diameter after 98 tests on spanish broom single roots which gives a ts of 108 mpa corresponding to 32 μm the equivalent diameter deq of the pp fiber used in this study table 2 pp fibers were added into moist sand gravimetric moisture content of the sand ranged from 0 08 to 0 10 by a rotary mixer fig 2b visual examinations showed that gravimetric moisture content of 0 1 prevented segregation of monofilament fibers and facilitated homogeneous mixture fig 2c the fiber contents ratio of dry weight of fiber to dry weight of sand of the two models were selected as 0 3 and 1 0 following the hydraulic and triaxial compression tests conducted on sand fiber mixture core samples discussed in the following section which were prepared with gravimetric fiber content wf ranging from 0 0 to 1 0 the dry unit weight of the bare streambank model was 14 kn m3 the porosity of the model was 0 45 the composite unit weight was 14 04 kn m3 and 14 14 kn m3 for models with 0 3 and 1 0 fiber content respectively constant head permeability tests astm 2006 were conducted on 55 samples with sand dry unit weight of 14 kn m3 of which the gravimetric fiber content wf ranged from 0 0 to 1 0 5 samples for each fiber content in order to reveal any differences in saturated hydraulic conductivity between various fiber contents in order to define the unsaturated flow characteristics of the fiber reinforced sand water retention tests on sand with fiber content wf ranged from 0 0 to 1 0 were conducted following the procedure introduced by akay et al 2013 the matric suction ψ of 11 core samples 6 4 cm long 7 26 cm diameter was measured by a tensiometer during a wetting process in which the volumetric water content θ of the initially dry sample was increased by adding 5 mg of water at certain intervals equilibrium condition should be reached before the next dosage until the cores reached saturation the computer controlled triaxial tests astm 2011 were conducted on sand fiber composite samples 14 5 cm long 7 3 cm diameter with fiber contents of 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 in order to determine the additional cohesion due to fiber reinforcement cf the triaxial compression test specimens were compacted to a sand dry unit weight of 14 kn m3 the fiber reinforced specimens were prepared by hand mixing dry sand water 10 of the weight of the sand and pp fibers each streambank model was tested under two different seepage hydraulic gradients by maintaining piezometric heads of 50 cm h2o and 100 cm h2o in the upstream section of the erosion flume where a constant level reservoir was located fig 1 the experiments started at the time water was supplied to the reservoir during the experiments the time seepage flow emerged on the streambank slope surface was recorded time of seepage ts positive pore water pressures developed within the streambank models were measured at 120 s intervals by three vibrating wire vw piezometers model 52610520 by durham geo slope indicator stone mountain georgia usa placed inside the slope elevation z 10 cm following the installation of the second layer during construction fig 1 in addition 13 tensiometers model cl 029b by soil measurement systems tucson arizona usa were placed on one side of the erosion flume to measure negative matric suction and positive pore water pressures developed near the wall section fig 1 the location of t4 t8 and t11 allowed a direct comparison of pressure heads measured by p1 p2 and p3 respectively which had the same x and z coordinates fig 1c and e each tensiometer was connected to a bi directional pressure transducer model asdxrrx005pdaa5 by honeywell sensing and control golden valley minnesota usa that transmitted the acquired data at 10 s intervals to a datalogger model cr1000 with am16 32 multiplexer and avw200 vw interface by campbell scientific logan utah usa which was previously used by akay et al 2013 2014a b 2016 2018 özer et al 2014 akay 2016 özer 2016 and akay and özer 2018 the experiments were terminated when the piezometric pressures measured by vw piezometers and tensiometers reached steady state in addition to the use of digital photography to document the physical condition of the slopes this study implemented three dimensional 3d laser scanning to measure the volume of erosion due to seepage ground based laser scanner lidar pizzuto et al 2010 and terrestrial laser scanning tls resop and hession 2010 has been used during streambank profile surveys to monitor bank retreat in the field laser scanning technology was used for obtaining three dimensional coordinates of the eroded bank surface with dimensions of 25 cm by 50 cm chu agor et al 2008 for scanning the topography of the erosion flume surface with dimensions of 650 cm by 136 cm aksoy et al 2012 and for calculating the volume of erosion of the bank with dimensions of 110 cm by 100 cm akay and özer 2018 during scaled physical laboratory experiments laboratory studies also utilized particle image velocimetry piv techniques to quantify spatially explicit bank deformation fields samadi et al 2013 and kinect photogrametric technology for measuring riverbank variations masoodi et al 2018 this study conducted laser scanning by a handheld laser scanner model freestyle3d by faro lake mary fl usa which created 3d point clouds with 0 2 mm resolution and 1 5 mm accuracy the point clouds were then processed by 2 5d volume calculation tool within cloudcompare open source software cloudcompare 2018 which has been utilized for measuring distances between two different point clouds esposito et al 2017 and for digitization of geological structures thiele et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydraulic tests the average saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat of the bare sand sample wf 0 0 was 1 5 10 4 m s with a sample standard deviation s of 0 11 10 4 m s the saturated hydraulic conductivity remained almost the same in the fiber content ranged from 0 0 to 0 5 table 3 however it started to decrease as the fiber content increased from 0 5 to 1 0 the average saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat of the sand with 1 0 fiber content reduced to 0 9 10 4 m s with a sample standard deviation s of 0 09 10 4 m s table 3 the inverse correlation between k sat or seepage velocity and wf was also reported earlier by babu and vasudevan 2008 for a similar soil sand reinforced with natural coir fibers the matric suction ψ and volumetric water content θ pairs of 11 samples are presented in fig 3 the retention curves for the data pairs with fiber content wf of 0 0 and 1 0 were fitted by the retc retention curve computer code van genuchten et al 1991 using the van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 4 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 5 m 1 1 n n 1 where h ψ is the pore water pressure head θs is the saturated water content θr is the residual water content α is the inverse of the air entry pressure bubbling pressure n is the pore size distribution index based on the curve fit of which the r 2 value for the regression of measured versus fitted values was 0 92 the van genuchten parameters of the bare sand wf 0 0 were θs 0 45 θr 0 0 α 0 06 cm 1 and n 2 69 table 1 and fig 3 the visual inspection of the spread of the data pairs showed that the inclusion of the discrete random pp fibers with the content range from 0 1 to 1 0 did not show an effect on the retention parameters of the bare sand the van genuchten parameters of the sand with the highest fiber content wf 1 0 was similar to that of the bare sand r 2 0 94 θs 0 45 θr 0 04 α 0 07 cm 1 and n 2 69 fig 3 the negligible increase in residual water content parameter θr of the fiber reinforced sand with 1 0 fiber content was attributed to the presence of fibers that provided additional contact area for the water molecules which increased the water holding capacity at higher matric suction 3 2 triaxial compression tests the triaxial compression tests results along with the tests conducted by akay et al 2018 with fiber contents of 0 0 bare sand 0 1 0 3 0 6 and 1 0 are given in table 4 additional fiber cohesion cf manifested itself even at fiber content as low as 0 2 with a value of 3 0 kpa since the effective cohesion c of the bare sand was zero table 1 eq 2 was rewritten for fiber reinforced sand as follows 6 τ c f σ u w tan ϕ where c in eq 2 was replaced by cf which depends on the fiber content table 4 however the increase in cf with wf was intermittent as the effective friction angle ϕ of the failure envelope also had an impact on the value of cf for example cf decreased from 3 0 kpa to 1 6 kpa conversely ϕ increased from 29 5 to 31 2 when wf increased from 0 2 to 0 3 moreover cf increased from 1 6 kpa to 5 7 kpa conversely ϕ decreased from 31 2 to 28 9 when wf increased from 0 3 to 0 4 the fluctuations in cf and ϕ with increase in wf continued until the strength parameters reached the values of 6 2 kpa and 32 5 for wf equal to 1 0 table 4 the range of cf 0 6 2 kpa found in this study is similar to the cohesion due to fibrous roots

longleaf pine 6 0 kpa 3 3 physical model experiments bare slope experiments conducted earlier by akay and özer 2018 showed the progress of slope erosion under groundwater seepage flow for example following the seepage flow emergence on the slope surface at t 98 min time of seepage after the start of the experiment under 50 cm h2o piezometric head bc seepage flow entrapped soil particles on the slope surface and the cavity formed due to erosion reached to an elevation of 30 cm on the slope surface 16 min after the time of seepage fig 4 a the top elevation of the cavity due to seepage erosion increased to 40 cm and 55 cm at times t 132 min and 180 min respectively fig 4b and c the steady state seepage discharge q was 0 01 l s at the end of the bare slope experiment under 50 cm h2o piezometric head bc tensiometers t and piezometers p located along the bottom of the slope order from the inlet to the outlet t4 p1 t8 p2 t11 p3 t13 refer to fig 1c and e reached steady state with pore water pressure heads of 36 6 48 6 31 3 34 5 25 0 21 6 and 18 3 cm h2o respectively fig 5 a this resulted in a hydraulic gradient of 0 18 which was calculated by dividing the pressure head difference between t4 and t13 36 6 18 3 cm h2o by the distance in between 103 cm concurrently the seepage erosion ceased as the degraded slope material entrapped by the seepage flow accumulated at the toe of the slope where it acted as a buttress against seepage forces fig 4c this phenomenon was referred by midgley et al 2013 as self healing the inlet bc was then increased to 100 cm h2o piezometric head after a 4 day free drainage period due to higher seepage gradient the time of seepage reduced to 29 min fig 5b the top of the erosion cavity reached to elevations of 90 cm and 110 cm crest of the slope at t 36 min and t 42 min respectively fig 4d and e the steady state seepage discharge q was 0 034 l s the tensiometers and piezometers reached steady state at t 60 min fig 5b and similar to the situation observed under 50 cm h2o piezometric head bc self healing prevented the erosion progressing further into the slope fig 4f the inclusion of pp fiber into sand with a content of 0 3 increased the shear resistance fiber cohesion cf was equal to 1 6 kpa according to triaxial tests refer to table 4 against seepage forces compared to bare sand as the erosion cavity raised to the level of 24 cm on the slope surface 46 min after the time of seepage under 50 cm h2o piezometric head bc fig 6 a consistent to the fact found by hydraulic tests that the inclusion of fibers did not have a noticeable effect on k sat and water retention characteristics the time of seepage of the experiment 100 min remained approximately the same compared to bare sand slope experiment under 50 cm h2o piezometric head bc fig 7 a it should be noted here that the initial pore water condition of the slopes which was another factor that has an impact on the time of seepage was also similar since the volumetric water content of the sand during construction was maintained between 0 11 and 0 14 for example the initial pore water pressure condition of the slopes of bare sand and sand with 0 3 fiber content average of 13 tensiometers at t 0 was 36 8 and 42 7 cm h2o respectively figs 5a and 7a similar to the situation monitored during the bare sand slope experiment tensiometers and vw piezometers indicated the progress of phreatic surface from the inlet reservoir to the slope face as pore water pressures started to increase first at t4 p1 closest to the inlet and lastly at t13 closest to the slope surface fig 7a the close match between t4 p1 t8 p2 and t11 p3 indicated uniform flow conditions along the width of the erosion flume and also provided evidence for the non existence of a preferential flow along the interface between the model and the side wall of the erosion flume fig 7 the top of erosion cavity reached to an elevation of 30 cm and 34 cm on the slope surface at t 164 min and t 180 min end of experiment respectively fig 6b and c the steady state seepage discharge q was 0 011 l s the inlet bc was increased to 100 cm h2o piezometric head after a 10 day free drainage period of the slope the initial condition of the slope average of 13 tensiometers at the start of the experiment under 100 cm h2o piezometric head bc was 33 0 cm h2o however due to the higher gradient the time of seepage reduced to 28 min fig 7b the top of the erosion cavity reached to elevations of 44 cm and 67 cm at t 55 min and t 68 min respectively fig 6d and e the steady state seepage discharge q was 0 036 l s the experiment was terminated when the slope was self healed with a cavity elevation of 85 cm at t 120 min fig 6f the fiber cohesion cf of 6 2 kpa demonstrated a favorable effect as the slope with 1 0 fiber content effectively resisted the seepage forces which resulted in an elevation of only 6 cm for the top of erosion cavity at the end of the experiment t 180 min under 50 cm h2o piezometric head bc fig 8 a the time of seepage increased to 111 min even though the initial condition of 37 4 cm h2o was similar to other experiments this was due to the fact that the k sat value of 0 9 10 4 m s found during hydraulic tests on sand with 1 fiber content slowed down the progress of the phreatic front table 3 and fig 9 a on the other hand steady state pore water pressures developed at the end of the experiment within the slope remained similar to the bare sand slope as t4 p1 t8 p2 t11 p3 t13 recorded pore water pressure heads of 35 6 33 4 28 8 23 5 19 2 15 3 and 8 9 cm h2o respectively fig 9a the steady state seepage flow hydraulic gradient reached at the end of the experiment was then calculated as 0 26 the steady state seepage discharge q was 0 009 l s the inlet bc was increased to 100 cm h2o piezometric head after a 6 day free drainage of the slope the initial condition of the slope average of 13 tensiometers at the start of the experiment under 100 cm h2o piezometric head bc was 24 4 cm h2o and the time of seepage was 11 min fig 9b the steady state seepage discharge q was 0 033 l s the top of erosion cavity could only reach to an elevation of 12 cm at the end of the experiment fig 8b seepage erosion volumes e v m3 of the three slopes with fiber content of 0 0 0 3 and 1 0 were calculated by comparing point clouds obtained by 3d laser scanning of the slopes at times given in figs 4 6 and 8 to the point cloud of the original 45 slope at t 0 for example point clouds of the slope with 0 3 fiber content obtained by 3d laser scanning at t 0 original 45 slope and at t 7200 s end of experiment under 100 cm h2o piezometric head bc refer to fig 6f were superimposed in fig 10 a the side view in y direction clearly showed the eroded zone indicated by the triangle abc at the end of the experiment with respect to the original 45 slope fig 10a the total erosion volume e v m3 was calculated by the integration of raster cells the area of each cell was 0 005 m 0 005 m in xy plane where the height of each cell was equal to the elevation change δz in between the two point clouds fig 10b within the degradation scour zone δz had negative values minimum value of 0 476 m whereas in the accumulation zone δz had positive values maximum value of 0 232 m fig 10b the integration resulted in a value of 0 123 m3 for e v at the end of experiment with 0 3 fiber content under 100 cm h2o piezometric head bc fig 10 the e v values calculated at 3d laser scanning times of the two slopes with fiber content of 0 0 and 0 3 were given in table 5 since fiber inclusion 1 0 were able to protect the slope against seepage erosion entirely fig 8 3d laser scanning was conducted only at the end of experiments under 50 and 100 cm h2o piezometric head bc for which e v was calculated as zero not included in table 5 the e v values calculated at the end of experiments t t3 showed the reduction in total seepage erosion volume with increase in fiber content wf table 5 for example fiber inclusion of 0 3 resulted in a decrease from 0 049 m3 bare slope to 0 017 m3 35 reduction and from 0 259 m3 bare slope to 0 123 m3 47 reduction under 50 and 100 cm h2o piezometric head bc respectively table 5 in order to examine the strength of the relationship between seepage erosion and seepage discharge a prominent factor in seepage erosion seepage erosion rates e kg s were calculated as follows 7 e δ e v δ t ρ b where δ e v m3 is the volume of the seepage erosion that occurred during δ t s the time between two successive 3d laser scans the bulk density of the slope ρ b was 1427 kg m3 for example e was calculated as 0 010 kg s 0 007 m3 6840 s 5880 s 1427 kg m3 from the time of seepage to the time of first 3d laser scanning time interval of ts t1 during the bare slope experiment under 50 cm h2o piezometric head bc table 5 a power law relationship could then be constituted between seepage discharge q l s and seepage erosion rate e kg s 8 e a q b where the empirical regression parameters a and b were equal to 292 and 2 2 for the experiments with the bare sand slope and to 81 and 2 3 for the experiments with the sand slope with 0 3 fiber content the correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 91 for both bare sand and sand with 0 3 fiber content demonstrated a power law relationship between e and q using the limited number of data given in table 5 please note that sand with 1 0 fiber content was not included in the analysis as erosion volumes were zero during those experiments fig 8 seepage erosion rates e were then nondimensionalized in order to apply the sediment transport function for seepage erosion introduced by fox et al 2006 which was based on a power law relationship between the dimensionless sediment discharge q s and dimensionless seepage flow shear stress τ 9 q s a 1 τ b 1 where a1 and b1 are empirical regression parameters dimensionless sediment discharge q s and dimensionless seepage flow shear stress τ was calculated by the following equations given by howard and mclane 1988 and fox et al 2007b respectively 10 q s q sf ρ s 1 γ w d 3 1 2 11 τ q sin θ s 1 n k sat where q sf is the specific sediment discharge expressed as weight of solids per unit time per unit width i e equal to e 9 81 m s2 m ρ is the fluid density 1000 kg m3 s is the specific gravity of an individual sediment particle 2 65 γ w is the specific weight of the liquid 9810 n m3 d is the median grain diameter 0 39 mm q m s is the seepage discharge per unit flow area θ is the streambank angle 45 n is the porosity 0 45 and ksat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity 1 5 10 4 m s for the bare sand and 1 6 10 4 m s for the sand with 0 3 fiber content the calculated values of τ and q s were given in table 5 the regression parameters a and b were equal to 90 and 4 0 for the bare sand and to 25 and 5 4 for the sand with 0 3 fiber content respectively 4 conclusions high phreatic surface levels in the riparian zone following the rising limb of hydrographs initiate subsurface flow towards the streambank where it emerges on the surface as seepage flow which could cause erosion on the surface this study investigated the application of a fibrous streambank protection that used 6 mm long discrete pp fibers as a soil admixture the range of fiber cohesion cf of 0 6 kpa 6 2 kpa introduced by fiber inclusion showed that fibrous streambank protection was able to substitute the cohesion due to roots cr the cohesion due to the fiber inclusion cf mimicked the behavior of root reinforcement as the amount of erosion reduced with increase in fiber content wf hydraulic tests showed that the retention parameters of the sand reinforced with fiber at various contents were similar which explained the similarity of piezometric conditions among the physical streambank model experiments in addition constant head permeability tests showed a decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat with increase in wf as a result an increase in the time of seepage was observed during the experiments with wf 1 0 the scale of the erosion flume and the constructed streambank model of this study was able to replicate flow dynamics of field scale experiments as steady state seepage discharges q ranging from 0 009 l s to 0 036 l s and seepage erosion rates e ranging from 0 001 kg s to 0 262 kg s during laboratory experiments were similar to those of in situ seepage induced streambank erosion experiments conducted by midgley et al 2013 in which q and e was measured as high as 0 007 l s and 0 014 kg s respectively the use of point clouds obtained by 3d laser scanning was found to be effective in calculating the sediment erosion volume caused by seepage flow during experiments the seepage flow discharge q l s and seepage erosion rate e kg s had a power law relationship fibrous streambank protection with 0 3 fiber content inclusion reduced the total amount of seepage erosion by 35 and 47 under 50 and 100 cm h2o piezometric head boundary condition bc respectively fibrous streambank protection with 1 0 fiber content effectively prevented seepage erosion during streambank experiments future studies should include finer grained materials e g silt and clayey streambank materials to investigate the effect of fiber inclusion on seepage erosion mechanisms of cohesive soils in addition the effect of fiber inclusion length and composition type monofilament versus fibrillated on erosion process should be investigated acknowledgments this work was supported by the scientific and

6987,water withdrawn from lakes is one of pathways to support economic development in china yet lake water withdrawals especially through unauthorized behaviors have not been accurately quantified here we proposed a coupled simulation optimization model to determine the unauthorized water withdrawals from lake dianchi the sixth largest freshwater lake in china and assessed their impacts on lake hydrology together the results of systematic observations on site surveys and local statistics reveal that lake water withdrawals played a non negligible role in lake water budget accounting for 19 6 of total outputs from the lake over the period 1999 2011 most water withdrawal events occurred from april to october when toxic blooms of cyanobacteria happened lake water withdrawals reshuffled water budget components of the lake itself leading to a substantial decrease in lake outflows and water levels and an increase of highly polluted return flows which might further intensify local lake eutrophication and downstream water scarcity in the light of the importance for sustainable water management we suggest that a new and expanding monitoring network across china s lakes to understand the process of lake water withdrawals would be beneficial to meet water demands without compromising lake ecosystems abbreviations qin lake inflow qout lake outflow qwith lake water withdrawals p

analysis 1 introduction water withdrawals from streams lakes and reservoirs provide approximately 80 of the water used in china ju et al 2017 mwr 2016 supporting more than half of irrigation to maintain food security lu et al 2015b however soaring water withdrawals have substantially altered the dynamics of water budget alcamo et al 2003 coe and foley 2001 döll et al 2009 elliott et al 2014 fekete et al 2010 haddeland et al 2014 piao et al 2010 swenson and wahr 2009 recent limited observations in developed countries showed that the decrease in outflow and the water level fluctuations of lakes partly induced by lake water withdrawals were the symptoms of an imbalance in their water budget gronewold and stow 2014 tang et al 2009 lake water withdrawals especially through unauthorized behaviors are common especially in china however the unauthorized lake water withdrawals have not yet been accurately quantified sahoo et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 the lack of direct observations inspired hydrological models to help estimating lake water withdrawals biemans et al 2011 haddeland et al 2006 hanasaki et al 2008 at present watershed scale hydrological models such as the soil and water tools swat and hydrological simulation program fortran hspf could be applied to constrain the estimates of lake water withdrawals dargahi and setegn 2011 kim et al 2007 zarriello et al 2010 nevertheless the results of these models are still highly uncertain due to the assumptions about irrigation timing and methods insufficient local observations or surveys also limit the use of regional hydrological models in addition previous water balance analyses quantified lake water withdrawals based on the model simulated lake inflows and the observed water budget components anderson et al 2015 fadlillah and widyastuti 2016 sahoo et al 2010 sahoo et al 2013 tang et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 however the influences of lake water withdrawals on lake surface inflows were not explicitly quantified resulting in estimation uncertainty such drawbacks could be further addressed by performing comprehensive measurements of lake water budget components sahoo et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 and by iteratively running hydrological simulation within optimization framework here we proposed a coupled simulation optimization model to quantify unauthorized water withdrawals from the lake and assessed their impacts on lake water hydrology over the period 1999 2011 lake dianchi the sixth largest freshwater lake in china was chosen as study area first systematic and high resolution observations were conducted to constrain the model estimated lake water withdrawals at monthly scale which were further validated by on site surveys and local statistics second scenarios based simulations were applied to isolate the impacts of lake water withdrawals in the end we discussed the critical role of lake water withdrawals on lake water hydrology as well as model updates and monitoring network development 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lake dianchi is located on the yunnan guizhou plateau in southwestern china 24 29 to 25 28 n 102 29 to 103 01 e fig 1 a it has a surface area of 310 km2 at the elevation of 1887 5 m a s l a mean depth of 5 3 m and a water retention time of 3 5 years the lake is artificially divided into two segments by an embankment the northern part 12 km2 is surrounded by the urban area of kunming city whereas the southern part 298 km2 is bordered by intensively managed croplands fig 1b lake dianchi watershed has the area of 2 920 km2 where land use is primarily forest 47 followed by croplands 20 and urban areas 16 fig 1c the watershed has an annual mean temperature of 15 c and rainfall of 1035 mm sixteen rivers flowing into the lake account for 90 of total surface inflows fig 1b zhan et al 2017 while direct runoff areas contribute the rest there are two outlets of the lake located in haikou station for the southern part and in xiyuan tunnel for the northern part fig 1b to avoid urban flooding both of them are regulated to keep lake water level within the range from 1885 5 m a s l to 1887 5 m a s l in addition water supplies in the lake dianchi watershed primarily depend on 10 reservoirs and 3 transboundary water transfer projects fig 1a and b rather than on rivers and lake dianchi although local government banned the water withdrawals from lake dianchi farmers surrounding the lake have been pumping water for agricultural irrigation to cultivate staple or cash crops especially in the direct runoff areas which contain regulated but often unauthorized ditches such unauthorized water withdrawals may lead to substantial changes in lake water budget leading to adverse consequences for lake ecosystems the effect of unauthorized lake water withdrawals on lake water hydrology is therefore not only of scientific interest but also causing political implications 2 2 quantification and validation of lake water withdrawals 2 2 1 quantification of lake water withdrawals unlike previous water balance analyses we proposed a coupled simulation optimization model to compute lake water withdrawal qwith it iteratively runs the dc hspf hydrological simulation program fortran for lake dianchi watershed kim et al 2007 to minimize the discrepancy in monthly total surface inflows between water budget estimation q in wb and hydrological simulation q in sim the coupled simulation optimization model consists of two critical components i the simulation model dc hspf to predict q in sim under different qwith values and ii the optimization model to minimize discrepancy between q in wb and q in sim over the whole period from 1999 to 2011 a general framework of the coupled simulation optimization model can be described as follows zhou et al 2015 1a min z t q in wb q in sim subject to 1b q in wb q with q out e p g δ s 1c q in sim h q with 1d t q with i α i a r e a i q with 0 where q in wb is determined based on lake water balance equation including the randomly generated value of qwith qout e p and g denote regulated outflow at the two outlets overlake evaporation overlake precipitation i e precipitation falling directly into the lake and groundwater discharge respectively δs is the change in lake water storage in which water storage can be calculated based on lake water levels and stage storage curve for lake dianchi q in sim is simulated by the dc hspf constrained by streamflow observations t and i are the month and crop type indices i 1 2 i respectively αi and areai are irrigation demands by crop types and the corresponding irrigation areas respectively note that αi and areai were collected from local agricultural service centers and local statistics respectively a genetic algorithm ga was then applied to search the optimal values of qwith more details on the adopted ga could be found in sahoo et al 2010 within this model framework overlake evaporation e is one of critical components for the water balance estimation e is calculated by averaging the estimates of three methods that were specialized based on local experiments in china the first one is pan evaporation correction min and liu 2006 2 e a d c p e p where cp is the ratio of the overlake evaporation to pan evaporation ep determined as 0 95 in min and liu 2006 a d is the lake surface area as a function of lake water level d the second one is the penman monteith equation min 2001 penman 1948 3a e a d δ r n γ f u e e δ γ where 3b e 0 611 e 17 27 t t 237 3 δ 4098 e 237 3 t 2 and δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure temperature curve kpa c 1 rn is the net radiation in units of equivalent depth of water mm month 1 γ is the psychometric coefficient 0 0642 kpa c 1 gundekar et al 2007 f u is a function of the wind speed u i e f u 0 26 1 0 5u m s 1 e and e are the saturated vapor pressure and the vapor pressure of the air at the reference height respectively kpa t is monthly average air temperature c the third one is the mass transfer equation min 2004 4 e 2 421 n 1 k r exp 0 0684 t a d where n is the number of days in the measured month r is the relative humidity over lake surface t is monthly average air temperature c k is the monthly variation coefficient ranging from 0 85 to 0 92 min 2004 in addition the reliability of dc hspf is at the heart of the hydrological simulation for q in sim first in addition to natural conditions human activities e g land use and land cover changes reservoirs transboundary water transfers human water uses wastewater discharges in the watershed were completely taken into consideration in the dc hspf second the effect of lake water withdrawals qwith was taken into account and assumed to be entirely used for cropland irrigation in the direct runoff areas rather than the river basins that are located far from the lake fig 1c third the parameters of dc hspf were calibrated by observations of 16 rivers from 2009 to 2011 and further validated by routine daily observations for the two largest rivers over the period 1999 2008 as well as by a detailed investigation of the yunnan hydrological bureau yhb last an automatic method for parameter estimation pest was applied for calibrating model parameters kim et al 2007 the detailed model framework of the dc hspf is provided in fig s1 dong et al 2016 the predictive performances of the dc hspf were measured using three quantitative statistics sahoo et al 2010 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias bias and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr 2 2 2 validation of lake water withdrawals to validate the magnitude of qwith we collected local statistics including all the water suppliers and users within the lake dianchi watershed water users comprise factories agricultural irrigation domestic and municipal water uses and livestock breeding according to the balance between water suppliers and users the unauthorized water withdrawals were indirectly estimated to further understand the inter annual and seasonal variabilities of lake water withdrawals we conducted an on site survey only on farmers who cultivate staple or cash crops surrounding the lake and can easily pump water from the lake eventually three hundred representative farmers were selected for a face to face questionnaire based household survey to collect information on sowing area and per area irrigation rate by crop types as well as the schedule of irrigation application based on the on site survey results a time series plot for agricultural irrigation surrounding the lake were produced which can be also used to validate the estimation of lake water withdrawals the details of surveyed information are provided in fig s2 2 3 separation of the impacts of lake water withdrawals to isolate the impacts of lake water withdrawals on lake hydrology two simulations were conducted with dc hspf in simulation s1 climatic factors all human activities and lake water withdrawals varied from 1999 to 2011 in simulation s2 only climatic factors and human activities were considered while lake water withdrawals were set to zero from 1999 to 2011 thus the difference between s1 and s2 represents the effect of lake water withdrawals on total surface inflows into the lake the water balance equation was then used to derive the other water balance components based on new lake surface inflows q in s2 estimated in simulation s2 lake outflow could further be determined based on the criteria related to flooding prevention see eq 5 thus lake outflows remained the same as those in simulation s1 if lake water level d is 1887 5 m otherwise it could be calculated as 5 q out d q out s1 if d 1887 5 m q in s2 p g e 1887 5 δ s 1887 5 if d 1887 5 m where q in s1 and q in s2 denote total surface inflows simulated in s1 and s2 respectively finally lake water storage change and overlake evaporation could be synchronously estimated by optimization solver eq 1 because both of them are dependent on lake water level d 6 min z q in s2 p g q out d e d δ s d subject to d 1885 5 1887 5 2 4 algorithmic processes in order to explain the coupled simulation optimization model in a logical and comprehensive way we simply introduced the algorithmic processes to determine correct qwith and isolate the impacts of qwith on lake water balance as below fig 2 step 1 randomly generate qwith and simulate total surface inflows by the calibrated dc hspf model eq 1c q in sim and water balance approach eq 1b q in wb step 2 following the ga algorithm minimize the discrepancy between q in wb and q in sim over the whole period from 1999 to 2011 eq 1a subject to constraints eqs 1b 1d where the correct qwith are determined at monthly scale step 3 simulate total surface inflows by the calibrated dc hspf model with or without the consideration of qwith step 4 estimate qout d following eq 5 based on the values of q in s2 and calculate both of δs and e by the optimization solver eq 6 2 5 datasets two types of datasets are required for quantifying lake water withdrawals for the water balance estimation daily precipitation and the other meteorological parameters i e evaporation measured by evaporation pan e601 with the diameter of 618 mm air temperature relative humidity wind speed solar radiation and vapor pressure were collected from 5 meteorological stations close to lake dianchi fig 1 these stations were run by the yunnan meteorological service http www ynmb cn daily lake outflows at two outlets and lake water levels were observed by the yunnan hydrological bureau yhb the stage storage curve for lake dianchi was derived basing on the latest lake bathymetry data surveyed by the kunming bureau of environmental protection kbep fig s3 in addition groundwater discharge was based on the most recent and detailed estimates of chai 2013 using darcy s law 0 34 106 m3 yr 1 which accounts for 0 2 of total surface inflows because monthly time series of groundwater data are unavailable the long term monthly values were assumed to be equal to annual estimate divided by 12 for hydrological simulations daily precipitation data were collected from 16 meteorological stations from the yhb across lake dianchi watershed fig 1 land use dynamics were determined from the 30 m china s land use cover dataset produced by lu et al 2015a soil attributes were available from china soil scientific database http vdb3 soil csdb cn the other input data including the outflows of 10 reservoirs 8 wastewater treatment plants and 3 transboundary water diversions were measured by the yhb or the kmeb in addition to routine observations of streamflow in two rivers from the yhb we built an observation network to measure streamflow in the other 14 rivers from 2009 to 2011 fig 1 water levels of these tributaries were measured at a ten minute interval using a hobotm data logger u20 001 01 onset computer corporation ma usa current velocities were measured using a global watertm flow probe fp201 in each subsection of the cross section for each river table s1 more details of datasets can be found in table 1 3 results 3 1 model performances in quantifying qin and qwith the data model comparisons in fig 3 a reveal that the simulated daily streamflows were generally consistent with the observations of 16 rivers for the period 2009 2011 with nse of 0 70 bias of 1 4 and rsr of 0 40 the dc hspf model also reproduced the seasonal variations of the simulated streamflows fig 3b the details of the calibrated parameters and modeling results for 16 river were provided in table s2 to s3 and fig s4 the calibrated dc hspf model was further validated against multiple independent observations from the yhb first the observed daily streamflows of panlong and baoxiang rivers from 1999 to 2008 were well captured fig 3c with nse of 0 82 bias of 15 7 and rsr of 0 29 second the mean of long term total surface inflows of 16 rivers and direct runoff areas from 1999 to 2011 was estimated as 586 8 106 m3 yr 1 which differs by only 2 5 compared to the value of 572 5 106 m3 yr 1 reported in a detailed yhb investigation fig 3d therefore the calibrated dc hspf model can serve as a reliable predictor for the hydrological simulation of lake inflows combining the calibrated dc hspf model with optimization solver we found a convergence between the optimized total surface inflows and the water balance estimates from 1999 to 2011 fig 3e with r 2 of 0 98 for both inter annual and monthly variations these results suggest that total surface inflows that include the additional return flow could be well quantified using the coupled simulation optimization model lake water withdrawals were synchronously determined by the coupled model over the period 1999 2011 the mean annual lake water withdrawals 1 56 108 m3 yr 1 was further validated by both local statistics and on site surveys fig 3f first local statistics from the yhb demonstrates that the mean annual actual irrigation in lake dianchi watershed was approximately 2 6 108 m3 yr 1 which is much larger than the maximum water supply of the 10 reservoirs for agricultural irrigation 1 0 108 m3 yr 1 the remaining irrigation demand ranging from 1 60 to 1 82 108 m3 yr 1 had to rely on the lake as an alternative source water second on site surveys indicate that the mean irrigation demand of direct runoff areas was 1 63 108 m3 yr 1 which differs by only 5 compared to our model estimation fig 3f such consistency in the three estimates implies that the simulation optimization model is reliable to quantify the unauthorized lake water withdrawals 3 2 inter annual and seasonal variability of qwith annual lake water withdrawals were significantly increased from 1 1 108 m3 yr 1 in 1999 to 3 2 108 m3 yr 1 in 2007 fig 4 a with an increasing growth rate of 0 20 108 m3 yr 2 p 0 01 however water withdrawals had been decreased persistently to 0 75 108 m3 yr 1 in 2011 with a decreasing rate of 0 5 108 m3 yr 2 such inter annual variability of qwith could be partially explained by the shift in crop mix in direct runoff areas specifically on site surveys of staple and cash crops in direct runoff areas suggest a trend of increased sowing area for cash crops e g flowers vegetables but decreased sowing area for staple crops except maize fig s2 such shift from staple crops to cash crops caused the growth of irrigation demand since per area water demands of flowers and vegetables were two fold larger than those of staple crops cropland irrigation in direct runoff areas was then estimated with an increasing growth rate of 0 07 108 m3 yr 2 before 2007 and a decline at the rate of 0 30 108 m3 yr 2 afterwards fig 4a explaining 50 of inter annual variation of qwith from lake dianchi seasonal variation of lake water withdrawals was large with a coefficient of variation of 44 fig 4b most water withdrawal events occurred from may to october but almost disappeared in the rest of the year such seasonal pattern can be explained by crop phenology planting or transplanting periods of staple crops and of most vegetables started at the end of april when precipitation was very low 28 7 27 9 mm month 1 in the lake dianchi watershed water pumped from the lake was then used for irrigating croplands close to lake dianchi flowers such as rose and lily are extensively planted in summer and autumn because of high air temperature and sunshine duration although precipitation increases to 166 186 mm month 1 in july and august fig 4b potential evapotranspiration remains at a high level irrigation supplied by the lake is therefore required to support flower growth 3 3 the role and impacts of qwith on lake water budget when considering the effect of the unauthorized lake water withdrawals fig 5 a shows the annual water budget components of lake dianchi from 1999 to 2011 on average qwith accounted for 19 6 of total outputs from the lake for the period 1999 2011 followed by lake outflows 42 9 and overlake evaporation 37 5 the return flow induced by lake water withdrawals contributed to 6 of total surface inflows in addition the mean monthly water budget components are shown in fig 5b for the same period lake water withdrawals from november to april were close to the lake outflow but exceeded overlake precipitation by 58 during the same period lake water withdrawals were also comparable to lake evaporation from may to december 17 9 106 m3 month 1 which further restricted the magnitude of lake outflows in summer the unauthorized lake water withdrawals might reshuffle water budget components of the lake first our scenario based simulations indicate that the mean monthly lake outflows may decline from 0 44 108 m3 month 1 simulation s2 to 0 29 108 m3 month 1 due to lake water withdrawals simulation s1 fig 6 a more evidently lake outflows in july and august approximately halve considering qwith fig 6b during the drought years 2009 2011 the negative impacts of water withdrawals on lake outflows were not evident because of the administrative intervention for unauthorized water withdrawals to prevent the sharp decline of water level in addition lake water withdrawals did alleviate local water scarcity within lake dianchi watershed but possibly intensified the water stress in downstream regions comparisons between the two simulations s1 vs s2 also show that lake water withdrawals could lead to a significant lower lake water level by approximate 0 36 m on average p 0 01 fig 6c and d such discrepancy would increase to 0 5 m from may to july fig 6d in addition lake water withdrawals resulted in a small increase of lake inflows 2 6 106 m3 month 1 due to the return flow from irrigated croplands in direct runoff areas fig 6e and f overall our results suggest that lake water withdrawals played a critical role in the lake water budget 4 discussion 4 1 scientific implication for model development previous studies generally ignored the unauthorized water withdrawals when performing water balance analysis or hydrological simulations mainly due to limited data availability however our estimates on site surveys and local statistics confirmed that there were substantial amount of lake water withdrawals specifically during crop growing seasons furthermore our results suggest that neglecting the unauthorized water withdrawals from lakes might reshuffle water budget components taking lake dianchi as an example lake inflows would be underestimated by 51 based on water balance equation fig s5a or by 6 based on hydrological simulations fig 6e if assuming lake water withdrawals equal to zero more importantly these underestimations may typically reach the maximum in late spring and summer fig s5b similarly evapotranspiration from croplands in direct runoff areas would be greatly understated when conducting watershed hydrological simulations without considering water withdrawn from the lake lake water withdrawals not only altered the hydrological cycling but also might intensify lake eutrophication first the unauthorized water withdrawals from the lake resulted in the decline of lake water levels thus proportionally lowering the dilution effect for pollutant loadings evident lake water level decreases happened from may to july this period overlapped with the cyanobacterial e g microcystis blooms zhan et al 2017 leading to higher toxic effects of cyanotoxins wu et al 2015 compared to the condition without the effect of qwith second lake water withdrawals led to large and irregular water level fluctuations fig 6c which possibly in turn increases lakeshore erosion related damage and reduces aquatic vegetation biodiversity havens et al 2005 hellsten and riihimiki 1996 in addition although the unauthorized water withdrawals from the lake increased the output of inlake pollutants lake water withdrawals led to the additional inputs from highly fertilized cropping areas returned back to the lake according to the observations of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the lake and return flow guo et al 2013 nutrient loadings of this additional input through return inflow were 10 times higher than the output of inlake pollutants through water withdrawals such pollution might be more severe during the fertilization period therefore quantifying unauthorized water withdrawals is critical for modeling lake water hydrology and lake eutrophication here our results provide new insights to help understand such behaviors in china firstly unauthorized water withdrawals predominately occur during the periods with intensive agricultural activities secondly the total amount of water withdrawn from the lake is positively correlated with the gap between crop water demands and water availability from the authorized and regulated irrigation systems apart from that the priming effect of lake water withdrawals on lake biomass accumulation should be carefully assessed in the future 4 2 scientific implication for monitoring network development despite the recognition of their importance lake water withdrawals either authorized or unauthorized were rarely studied due to the limitation of our current monitoring network according to china s land use cover dataset liu et al 2014 croplands dominated the land use in most of lake watersheds in china with the median value of 51 fig s6 a large part of these croplands were located near the lakes but far away from reservoirs in china such geographical mismatch between water consumers and water suppliers within lake watersheds may result in a strong dependence on lake water withdrawals for cropland irrigation surrounding lakes for example water withdrawal from lake taihu an eutrophic lake in east china reached 1 35 109 m3 yr 1 which equals to 19 of agricultural irrigation in the whole watershed in 2016 mwr 2016 however low frequency hydrological observations under current network over the lakes themselves and low resolution surveys for agricultural irrigations surrounding the lakes could potentially introduce uncertainties in historical estimates and future projections of lake water withdrawals such uncertainties would compromise planning and decisions process but could be significantly reduced by a new and expanding network with offshore monitoring stations findings from these monitoring platforms may help understand the lake water budget and the drivers of hydrological alteration as well as lake eutrophication 4 3 limitations currently our model framework still faces challenges during estimation of water withdrawals from the lake the challenges are primarily due to the uncertainty in groundwater discharges which could not be determined at a monthly scale during the study period second we assumed that all of lake water withdrawals were used for agricultural irrigation in croplands surrounding the lake despite the few lakeshore cement plants such assumption would introduce bias in estimation of return flow which depends on the proportion of water withdrawal for irrigation and the regions to be irrigated any changes in these factors may result in variations in lake water withdrawals to assess the influence of those uncertainties on the estimation of lake water withdrawals stochastic simulation such as the monte carlo analysis needs to be carried out in the future 5 conclusions to our knowledge this study is the first time to comprehensively quantify the unauthorized water withdrawals from chinese lakes and to assess their impacts on lake water hydrology our results from systematic observations on site surveys and local statistics suggest the non negligible role of lake water withdrawals in lake water budget accounting for 19 6 of total outputs from the lake over the period 1999 2011 most water withdrawal events occurred from april to october when toxic blooms of cyanobacteria happened the occurrence of lake water withdrawals resulted in a substantial decrease in lake outflows and water levels and an increase of highly polluted return flows which may further intensify lake eutrophication to determine unauthorized lake water withdrawals in china a new and expanding monitoring network should be established moreover in depth understanding and accurate quantification of the process of unauthorized water withdrawals are critical for the hydrological modeling community being vital for improving the attribution of hydrological alteration and lake eutrophication to the underlying causes more importantly unauthorized lake water withdrawals should be taken into account in lake water budget and impact assessment for lake eutrophication in the future as a long term goal it is urgent for us to develop sustainable lake management strategies to meet water demands without compromising

6987,water withdrawn from lakes is one of pathways to support economic development in china yet lake water withdrawals especially through unauthorized behaviors have not been accurately quantified here we proposed a coupled simulation optimization model to determine the unauthorized water withdrawals from lake dianchi the sixth largest freshwater lake in china and assessed their impacts on lake hydrology together the results of systematic observations on site surveys and local statistics reveal that lake water withdrawals played a non negligible role in lake water budget accounting for 19 6 of total outputs from the lake over the period 1999 2011 most water withdrawal events occurred from april to october when toxic blooms of cyanobacteria happened lake water withdrawals reshuffled water budget components of the lake itself leading to a substantial decrease in lake outflows and water levels and an increase of highly polluted return flows which might further intensify local lake eutrophication and downstream water scarcity in the light of the importance for sustainable water management we suggest that a new and expanding monitoring network across china s lakes to understand the process of lake water withdrawals would be beneficial to meet water demands without compromising lake ecosystems abbreviations qin lake inflow qout lake outflow qwith lake water withdrawals p

analysis 1 introduction water withdrawals from streams lakes and reservoirs provide approximately 80 of the water used in china ju et al 2017 mwr 2016 supporting more than half of irrigation to maintain food security lu et al 2015b however soaring water withdrawals have substantially altered the dynamics of water budget alcamo et al 2003 coe and foley 2001 döll et al 2009 elliott et al 2014 fekete et al 2010 haddeland et al 2014 piao et al 2010 swenson and wahr 2009 recent limited observations in developed countries showed that the decrease in outflow and the water level fluctuations of lakes partly induced by lake water withdrawals were the symptoms of an imbalance in their water budget gronewold and stow 2014 tang et al 2009 lake water withdrawals especially through unauthorized behaviors are common especially in china however the unauthorized lake water withdrawals have not yet been accurately quantified sahoo et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 the lack of direct observations inspired hydrological models to help estimating lake water withdrawals biemans et al 2011 haddeland et al 2006 hanasaki et al 2008 at present watershed scale hydrological models such as the soil and water tools swat and hydrological simulation program fortran hspf could be applied to constrain the estimates of lake water withdrawals dargahi and setegn 2011 kim et al 2007 zarriello et al 2010 nevertheless the results of these models are still highly uncertain due to the assumptions about irrigation timing and methods insufficient local observations or surveys also limit the use of regional hydrological models in addition previous water balance analyses quantified lake water withdrawals based on the model simulated lake inflows and the observed water budget components anderson et al 2015 fadlillah and widyastuti 2016 sahoo et al 2010 sahoo et al 2013 tang et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 however the influences of lake water withdrawals on lake surface inflows were not explicitly quantified resulting in estimation uncertainty such drawbacks could be further addressed by performing comprehensive measurements of lake water budget components sahoo et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 and by iteratively running hydrological simulation within optimization framework here we proposed a coupled simulation optimization model to quantify unauthorized water withdrawals from the lake and assessed their impacts on lake water hydrology over the period 1999 2011 lake dianchi the sixth largest freshwater lake in china was chosen as study area first systematic and high resolution observations were conducted to constrain the model estimated lake water withdrawals at monthly scale which were further validated by on site surveys and local statistics second scenarios based simulations were applied to isolate the impacts of lake water withdrawals in the end we discussed the critical role of lake water withdrawals on lake water hydrology as well as model updates and monitoring network development 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lake dianchi is located on the yunnan guizhou plateau in southwestern china 24 29 to 25 28 n 102 29 to 103 01 e fig 1 a it has a surface area of 310 km2 at the elevation of 1887 5 m a s l a mean depth of 5 3 m and a water retention time of 3 5 years the lake is artificially divided into two segments by an embankment the northern part 12 km2 is surrounded by the urban area of kunming city whereas the southern part 298 km2 is bordered by intensively managed croplands fig 1b lake dianchi watershed has the area of 2 920 km2 where land use is primarily forest 47 followed by croplands 20 and urban areas 16 fig 1c the watershed has an annual mean temperature of 15 c and rainfall of 1035 mm sixteen rivers flowing into the lake account for 90 of total surface inflows fig 1b zhan et al 2017 while direct runoff areas contribute the rest there are two outlets of the lake located in haikou station for the southern part and in xiyuan tunnel for the northern part fig 1b to avoid urban flooding both of them are regulated to keep lake water level within the range from 1885 5 m a s l to 1887 5 m a s l in addition water supplies in the lake dianchi watershed primarily depend on 10 reservoirs and 3 transboundary water transfer projects fig 1a and b rather than on rivers and lake dianchi although local government banned the water withdrawals from lake dianchi farmers surrounding the lake have been pumping water for agricultural irrigation to cultivate staple or cash crops especially in the direct runoff areas which contain regulated but often unauthorized ditches such unauthorized water withdrawals may lead to substantial changes in lake water budget leading to adverse consequences for lake ecosystems the effect of unauthorized lake water withdrawals on lake water hydrology is therefore not only of scientific interest but also causing political implications 2 2 quantification and validation of lake water withdrawals 2 2 1 quantification of lake water withdrawals unlike previous water balance analyses we proposed a coupled simulation optimization model to compute lake water withdrawal qwith it iteratively runs the dc hspf hydrological simulation program fortran for lake dianchi watershed kim et al 2007 to minimize the discrepancy in monthly total surface inflows between water budget estimation q in wb and hydrological simulation q in sim the coupled simulation optimization model consists of two critical components i the simulation model dc hspf to predict q in sim under different qwith values and ii the optimization model to minimize discrepancy between q in wb and q in sim over the whole period from 1999 to 2011 a general framework of the coupled simulation optimization model can be described as follows zhou et al 2015 1a min z t q in wb q in sim subject to 1b q in wb q with q out e p g δ s 1c q in sim h q with 1d t q with i α i a r e a i q with 0 where q in wb is determined based on lake water balance equation including the randomly generated value of qwith qout e p and g denote regulated outflow at the two outlets overlake evaporation overlake precipitation i e precipitation falling directly into the lake and groundwater discharge respectively δs is the change in lake water storage in which water storage can be calculated based on lake water levels and stage storage curve for lake dianchi q in sim is simulated by the dc hspf constrained by streamflow observations t and i are the month and crop type indices i 1 2 i respectively αi and areai are irrigation demands by crop types and the corresponding irrigation areas respectively note that αi and areai were collected from local agricultural service centers and local statistics respectively a genetic algorithm ga was then applied to search the optimal values of qwith more details on the adopted ga could be found in sahoo et al 2010 within this model framework overlake evaporation e is one of critical components for the water balance estimation e is calculated by averaging the estimates of three methods that were specialized based on local experiments in china the first one is pan evaporation correction min and liu 2006 2 e a d c p e p where cp is the ratio of the overlake evaporation to pan evaporation ep determined as 0 95 in min and liu 2006 a d is the lake surface area as a function of lake water level d the second one is the penman monteith equation min 2001 penman 1948 3a e a d δ r n γ f u e e δ γ where 3b e 0 611 e 17 27 t t 237 3 δ 4098 e 237 3 t 2 and δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure temperature curve kpa c 1 rn is the net radiation in units of equivalent depth of water mm month 1 γ is the psychometric coefficient 0 0642 kpa c 1 gundekar et al 2007 f u is a function of the wind speed u i e f u 0 26 1 0 5u m s 1 e and e are the saturated vapor pressure and the vapor pressure of the air at the reference height respectively kpa t is monthly average air temperature c the third one is the mass transfer equation min 2004 4 e 2 421 n 1 k r exp 0 0684 t a d where n is the number of days in the measured month r is the relative humidity over lake surface t is monthly average air temperature c k is the monthly variation coefficient ranging from 0 85 to 0 92 min 2004 in addition the reliability of dc hspf is at the heart of the hydrological simulation for q in sim first in addition to natural conditions human activities e g land use and land cover changes reservoirs transboundary water transfers human water uses wastewater discharges in the watershed were completely taken into consideration in the dc hspf second the effect of lake water withdrawals qwith was taken into account and assumed to be entirely used for cropland irrigation in the direct runoff areas rather than the river basins that are located far from the lake fig 1c third the parameters of dc hspf were calibrated by observations of 16 rivers from 2009 to 2011 and further validated by routine daily observations for the two largest rivers over the period 1999 2008 as well as by a detailed investigation of the yunnan hydrological bureau yhb last an automatic method for parameter estimation pest was applied for calibrating model parameters kim et al 2007 the detailed model framework of the dc hspf is provided in fig s1 dong et al 2016 the predictive performances of the dc hspf were measured using three quantitative statistics sahoo et al 2010 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias bias and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr 2 2 2 validation of lake water withdrawals to validate the magnitude of qwith we collected local statistics including all the water suppliers and users within the lake dianchi watershed water users comprise factories agricultural irrigation domestic and municipal water uses and livestock breeding according to the balance between water suppliers and users the unauthorized water withdrawals were indirectly estimated to further understand the inter annual and seasonal variabilities of lake water withdrawals we conducted an on site survey only on farmers who cultivate staple or cash crops surrounding the lake and can easily pump water from the lake eventually three hundred representative farmers were selected for a face to face questionnaire based household survey to collect information on sowing area and per area irrigation rate by crop types as well as the schedule of irrigation application based on the on site survey results a time series plot for agricultural irrigation surrounding the lake were produced which can be also used to validate the estimation of lake water withdrawals the details of surveyed information are provided in fig s2 2 3 separation of the impacts of lake water withdrawals to isolate the impacts of lake water withdrawals on lake hydrology two simulations were conducted with dc hspf in simulation s1 climatic factors all human activities and lake water withdrawals varied from 1999 to 2011 in simulation s2 only climatic factors and human activities were considered while lake water withdrawals were set to zero from 1999 to 2011 thus the difference between s1 and s2 represents the effect of lake water withdrawals on total surface inflows into the lake the water balance equation was then used to derive the other water balance components based on new lake surface inflows q in s2 estimated in simulation s2 lake outflow could further be determined based on the criteria related to flooding prevention see eq 5 thus lake outflows remained the same as those in simulation s1 if lake water level d is 1887 5 m otherwise it could be calculated as 5 q out d q out s1 if d 1887 5 m q in s2 p g e 1887 5 δ s 1887 5 if d 1887 5 m where q in s1 and q in s2 denote total surface inflows simulated in s1 and s2 respectively finally lake water storage change and overlake evaporation could be synchronously estimated by optimization solver eq 1 because both of them are dependent on lake water level d 6 min z q in s2 p g q out d e d δ s d subject to d 1885 5 1887 5 2 4 algorithmic processes in order to explain the coupled simulation optimization model in a logical and comprehensive way we simply introduced the algorithmic processes to determine correct qwith and isolate the impacts of qwith on lake water balance as below fig 2 step 1 randomly generate qwith and simulate total surface inflows by the calibrated dc hspf model eq 1c q in sim and water balance approach eq 1b q in wb step 2 following the ga algorithm minimize the discrepancy between q in wb and q in sim over the whole period from 1999 to 2011 eq 1a subject to constraints eqs 1b 1d where the correct qwith are determined at monthly scale step 3 simulate total surface inflows by the calibrated dc hspf model with or without the consideration of qwith step 4 estimate qout d following eq 5 based on the values of q in s2 and calculate both of δs and e by the optimization solver eq 6 2 5 datasets two types of datasets are required for quantifying lake water withdrawals for the water balance estimation daily precipitation and the other meteorological parameters i e evaporation measured by evaporation pan e601 with the diameter of 618 mm air temperature relative humidity wind speed solar radiation and vapor pressure were collected from 5 meteorological stations close to lake dianchi fig 1 these stations were run by the yunnan meteorological service http www ynmb cn daily lake outflows at two outlets and lake water levels were observed by the yunnan hydrological bureau yhb the stage storage curve for lake dianchi was derived basing on the latest lake bathymetry data surveyed by the kunming bureau of environmental protection kbep fig s3 in addition groundwater discharge was based on the most recent and detailed estimates of chai 2013 using darcy s law 0 34 106 m3 yr 1 which accounts for 0 2 of total surface inflows because monthly time series of groundwater data are unavailable the long term monthly values were assumed to be equal to annual estimate divided by 12 for hydrological simulations daily precipitation data were collected from 16 meteorological stations from the yhb across lake dianchi watershed fig 1 land use dynamics were determined from the 30 m china s land use cover dataset produced by lu et al 2015a soil attributes were available from china soil scientific database http vdb3 soil csdb cn the other input data including the outflows of 10 reservoirs 8 wastewater treatment plants and 3 transboundary water diversions were measured by the yhb or the kmeb in addition to routine observations of streamflow in two rivers from the yhb we built an observation network to measure streamflow in the other 14 rivers from 2009 to 2011 fig 1 water levels of these tributaries were measured at a ten minute interval using a hobotm data logger u20 001 01 onset computer corporation ma usa current velocities were measured using a global watertm flow probe fp201 in each subsection of the cross section for each river table s1 more details of datasets can be found in table 1 3 results 3 1 model performances in quantifying qin and qwith the data model comparisons in fig 3 a reveal that the simulated daily streamflows were generally consistent with the observations of 16 rivers for the period 2009 2011 with nse of 0 70 bias of 1 4 and rsr of 0 40 the dc hspf model also reproduced the seasonal variations of the simulated streamflows fig 3b the details of the calibrated parameters and modeling results for 16 river were provided in table s2 to s3 and fig s4 the calibrated dc hspf model was further validated against multiple independent observations from the yhb first the observed daily streamflows of panlong and baoxiang rivers from 1999 to 2008 were well captured fig 3c with nse of 0 82 bias of 15 7 and rsr of 0 29 second the mean of long term total surface inflows of 16 rivers and direct runoff areas from 1999 to 2011 was estimated as 586 8 106 m3 yr 1 which differs by only 2 5 compared to the value of 572 5 106 m3 yr 1 reported in a detailed yhb investigation fig 3d therefore the calibrated dc hspf model can serve as a reliable predictor for the hydrological simulation of lake inflows combining the calibrated dc hspf model with optimization solver we found a convergence between the optimized total surface inflows and the water balance estimates from 1999 to 2011 fig 3e with r 2 of 0 98 for both inter annual and monthly variations these results suggest that total surface inflows that include the additional return flow could be well quantified using the coupled simulation optimization model lake water withdrawals were synchronously determined by the coupled model over the period 1999 2011 the mean annual lake water withdrawals 1 56 108 m3 yr 1 was further validated by both local statistics and on site surveys fig 3f first local statistics from the yhb demonstrates that the mean annual actual irrigation in lake dianchi watershed was approximately 2 6 108 m3 yr 1 which is much larger than the maximum water supply of the 10 reservoirs for agricultural irrigation 1 0 108 m3 yr 1 the remaining irrigation demand ranging from 1 60 to 1 82 108 m3 yr 1 had to rely on the lake as an alternative source water second on site surveys indicate that the mean irrigation demand of direct runoff areas was 1 63 108 m3 yr 1 which differs by only 5 compared to our model estimation fig 3f such consistency in the three estimates implies that the simulation optimization model is reliable to quantify the unauthorized lake water withdrawals 3 2 inter annual and seasonal variability of qwith annual lake water withdrawals were significantly increased from 1 1 108 m3 yr 1 in 1999 to 3 2 108 m3 yr 1 in 2007 fig 4 a with an increasing growth rate of 0 20 108 m3 yr 2 p 0 01 however water withdrawals had been decreased persistently to 0 75 108 m3 yr 1 in 2011 with a decreasing rate of 0 5 108 m3 yr 2 such inter annual variability of qwith could be partially explained by the shift in crop mix in direct runoff areas specifically on site surveys of staple and cash crops in direct runoff areas suggest a trend of increased sowing area for cash crops e g flowers vegetables but decreased sowing area for staple crops except maize fig s2 such shift from staple crops to cash crops caused the growth of irrigation demand since per area water demands of flowers and vegetables were two fold larger than those of staple crops cropland irrigation in direct runoff areas was then estimated with an increasing growth rate of 0 07 108 m3 yr 2 before 2007 and a decline at the rate of 0 30 108 m3 yr 2 afterwards fig 4a explaining 50 of inter annual variation of qwith from lake dianchi seasonal variation of lake water withdrawals was large with a coefficient of variation of 44 fig 4b most water withdrawal events occurred from may to october but almost disappeared in the rest of the year such seasonal pattern can be explained by crop phenology planting or transplanting periods of staple crops and of most vegetables started at the end of april when precipitation was very low 28 7 27 9 mm month 1 in the lake dianchi watershed water pumped from the lake was then used for irrigating croplands close to lake dianchi flowers such as rose and lily are extensively planted in summer and autumn because of high air temperature and sunshine duration although precipitation increases to 166 186 mm month 1 in july and august fig 4b potential evapotranspiration remains at a high level irrigation supplied by the lake is therefore required to support flower growth 3 3 the role and impacts of qwith on lake water budget when considering the effect of the unauthorized lake water withdrawals fig 5 a shows the annual water budget components of lake dianchi from 1999 to 2011 on average qwith accounted for 19 6 of total outputs from the lake for the period 1999 2011 followed by lake outflows 42 9 and overlake evaporation 37 5 the return flow induced by lake water withdrawals contributed to 6 of total surface inflows in addition the mean monthly water budget components are shown in fig 5b for the same period lake water withdrawals from november to april were close to the lake outflow but exceeded overlake precipitation by 58 during the same period lake water withdrawals were also comparable to lake evaporation from may to december 17 9 106 m3 month 1 which further restricted the magnitude of lake outflows in summer the unauthorized lake water withdrawals might reshuffle water budget components of the lake first our scenario based simulations indicate that the mean monthly lake outflows may decline from 0 44 108 m3 month 1 simulation s2 to 0 29 108 m3 month 1 due to lake water withdrawals simulation s1 fig 6 a more evidently lake outflows in july and august approximately halve considering qwith fig 6b during the drought years 2009 2011 the negative impacts of water withdrawals on lake outflows were not evident because of the administrative intervention for unauthorized water withdrawals to prevent the sharp decline of water level in addition lake water withdrawals did alleviate local water scarcity within lake dianchi watershed but possibly intensified the water stress in downstream regions comparisons between the two simulations s1 vs s2 also show that lake water withdrawals could lead to a significant lower lake water level by approximate 0 36 m on average p 0 01 fig 6c and d such discrepancy would increase to 0 5 m from may to july fig 6d in addition lake water withdrawals resulted in a small increase of lake inflows 2 6 106 m3 month 1 due to the return flow from irrigated croplands in direct runoff areas fig 6e and f overall our results suggest that lake water withdrawals played a critical role in the lake water budget 4 discussion 4 1 scientific implication for model development previous studies generally ignored the unauthorized water withdrawals when performing water balance analysis or hydrological simulations mainly due to limited data availability however our estimates on site surveys and local statistics confirmed that there were substantial amount of lake water withdrawals specifically during crop growing seasons furthermore our results suggest that neglecting the unauthorized water withdrawals from lakes might reshuffle water budget components taking lake dianchi as an example lake inflows would be underestimated by 51 based on water balance equation fig s5a or by 6 based on hydrological simulations fig 6e if assuming lake water withdrawals equal to zero more importantly these underestimations may typically reach the maximum in late spring and summer fig s5b similarly evapotranspiration from croplands in direct runoff areas would be greatly understated when conducting watershed hydrological simulations without considering water withdrawn from the lake lake water withdrawals not only altered the hydrological cycling but also might intensify lake eutrophication first the unauthorized water withdrawals from the lake resulted in the decline of lake water levels thus proportionally lowering the dilution effect for pollutant loadings evident lake water level decreases happened from may to july this period overlapped with the cyanobacterial e g microcystis blooms zhan et al 2017 leading to higher toxic effects of cyanotoxins wu et al 2015 compared to the condition without the effect of qwith second lake water withdrawals led to large and irregular water level fluctuations fig 6c which possibly in turn increases lakeshore erosion related damage and reduces aquatic vegetation biodiversity havens et al 2005 hellsten and riihimiki 1996 in addition although the unauthorized water withdrawals from the lake increased the output of inlake pollutants lake water withdrawals led to the additional inputs from highly fertilized cropping areas returned back to the lake according to the observations of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the lake and return flow guo et al 2013 nutrient loadings of this additional input through return inflow were 10 times higher than the output of inlake pollutants through water withdrawals such pollution might be more severe during the fertilization period therefore quantifying unauthorized water withdrawals is critical for modeling lake water hydrology and lake eutrophication here our results provide new insights to help understand such behaviors in china firstly unauthorized water withdrawals predominately occur during the periods with intensive agricultural activities secondly the total amount of water withdrawn from the lake is positively correlated with the gap between crop water demands and water availability from the authorized and regulated irrigation systems apart from that the priming effect of lake water withdrawals on lake biomass accumulation should be carefully assessed in the future 4 2 scientific implication for monitoring network development despite the recognition of their importance lake water withdrawals either authorized or unauthorized were rarely studied due to the limitation of our current monitoring network according to china s land use cover dataset liu et al 2014 croplands dominated the land use in most of lake watersheds in china with the median value of 51 fig s6 a large part of these croplands were located near the lakes but far away from reservoirs in china such geographical mismatch between water consumers and water suppliers within lake watersheds may result in a strong dependence on lake water withdrawals for cropland irrigation surrounding lakes for example water withdrawal from lake taihu an eutrophic lake in east china reached 1 35 109 m3 yr 1 which equals to 19 of agricultural irrigation in the whole watershed in 2016 mwr 2016 however low frequency hydrological observations under current network over the lakes themselves and low resolution surveys for agricultural irrigations surrounding the lakes could potentially introduce uncertainties in historical estimates and future projections of lake water withdrawals such uncertainties would compromise planning and decisions process but could be significantly reduced by a new and expanding network with offshore monitoring stations findings from these monitoring platforms may help understand the lake water budget and the drivers of hydrological alteration as well as lake eutrophication 4 3 limitations currently our model framework still faces challenges during estimation of water withdrawals from the lake the challenges are primarily due to the uncertainty in groundwater discharges which could not be determined at a monthly scale during the study period second we assumed that all of lake water withdrawals were used for agricultural irrigation in croplands surrounding the lake despite the few lakeshore cement plants such assumption would introduce bias in estimation of return flow which depends on the proportion of water withdrawal for irrigation and the regions to be irrigated any changes in these factors may result in variations in lake water withdrawals to assess the influence of those uncertainties on the estimation of lake water withdrawals stochastic simulation such as the monte carlo analysis needs to be carried out in the future 5 conclusions to our knowledge this study is the first time to comprehensively quantify the unauthorized water withdrawals from chinese lakes and to assess their impacts on lake water hydrology our results from systematic observations on site surveys and local statistics suggest the non negligible role of lake water withdrawals in lake water budget accounting for 19 6 of total outputs from the lake over the period 1999 2011 most water withdrawal events occurred from april to october when toxic blooms of cyanobacteria happened the occurrence of lake water withdrawals resulted in a substantial decrease in lake outflows and water levels and an increase of highly polluted return flows which may further intensify lake eutrophication to determine unauthorized lake water withdrawals in china a new and expanding monitoring network should be established moreover in depth understanding and accurate quantification of the process of unauthorized water withdrawals are critical for the hydrological modeling community being vital for improving the attribution of hydrological alteration and lake eutrophication to the underlying causes more importantly unauthorized lake water withdrawals should be taken into account in lake water budget and impact assessment for lake eutrophication in the future as a long term goal it is urgent for us to develop sustainable lake management strategies to meet water demands without compromising

6988,understanding the metal dynamics in natural waters is critical to assessing the process and flow pathways that deliver these constituents to the stream network metal dynamics can be addressed by an analysis of concentration discharge relationship across a large spectrum of hydrological conditions however metal discharge responses have only been studied in detail for short periods or a few selected events in this study a detailed analysis of the hysteresis loops exhibited by metal concentration discharge relationship was undertaken to assess the al fe mn and cu dynamics and factors controlling changes in metal concentrations in a small scale rural catchment metal sediment associated and dissolved concentrations were measured at high temporal resolution during storm events in a small rural headwater catchment in galicia nw spain hysteresis analysis indicated a contrasting concentration discharge dynamic for sediment associated and dissolved metals highlighting a strong decoupling between the two due to their different sources or delivery pathways for sediment associated metals clockwise hysteresis 56 was the predominant pattern highlighting the rapid sediment associated metal mobilisation via surface runoff from sources located near the stream channel in contrast dissolved metal showed predominantly anticlockwise hysteresis 58 of storm events emphasising the role of subsurface flow and soil leaching processes the different flushing mechanisms between sediment associated and dissolved metals imply that different catchment management strategies should

introduction metals are among the most common environmental contaminants and their presence in waters and biota may be due to natural and or anthropogenic sources the main natural sources of metals in the waters come from chemical weathering of minerals and soil leaching salomons and förstner 1984 anthropogenic sources are mainly associated with domestic and industrial wastewaters urban storm water runoff atmospheric sources mining and rural area inputs kabata pendias and szteke 2015 particularly in rural catchments erosion and runoff from agricultural soils may be a major source of metals in

pathways williams 1989 evans and davies 1998 waeles et al 2015 el azzi et al 2016 the hysteresis represents a condition in which element concentration for a given discharge differs between the rising and falling limb of the hydrograph which happens because the peak discharge and the element do not occur at the same time williams 1989 evans and davies 1998 clockwise c q hysteresis describes solute or particulate concentrations rising as discharge increase reaching typically higher concentrations during the rising limb than during the falling limb of the hydrograph due to rapid mobilisation and exhaustion of solutes or particulate material from within or near sources to the stream williams 1989 nagorski et al 2003 miller 2016 this pattern often called first flush phenomenon is also attributed to flushing effects at the onset of the storm events when rainfall in the catchment leads to displacement of soil water into the stream channel piñol et al 1992 sokolov and black 1996 in contrast anticlockwise c q hysteresis is frequently related to a delayed subsurface response or to solute or particulate delivery from distant sources williams 1989 evans and davies 1998 el azzi et al 2016 peraza castro et al 2016 over the last few decades c q behaviour in ss rodríguez blanco et al 2010 gellis 2013 sherriff et al 2016 nutrients bowes et al 2005 butturini et al 2006 dupas et al 2015 and major ions whittfield and schreier 1981 knorr 2013 has been studied intensively at storm event scale in a wide range of catchments however there are fewer studies on metal c q behaviour particularly in headwater catchments with minimal human impact nagorski et al 2003 miller 2016 even though in relatively pristine areas low metal concentrations may also have important consequences for the functioning of the aquatic environment because of their potential toxicity to biota huser et al 2011 the general objective of this paper was to understand the temporal dynamic of metal concentrations and fluxes in a small headwater catchment in nw spain more specifically objectives were to i identify and classify the different types of metal al fe mn and cu c q hysteresis at storm event scale and ii evaluate how different factors can explain the hysteresis loops by studying the relationship between hydro climatic parameters and metal concentration dynamics to achieve these objectives discharge and dissolved and particulate metal data were collected at high frequency during storm events in the corbeira catchment galicia nw spain over four consecutive hydrological years 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study focused on the corbeira catchment a small rural catchment 16 km2 located in the upper reaches of the mero river basin near the city of a coruña nw spain fig 1 the mean elevation of the catchment is about 267 m a m s l min 60 m a m s l max 470 m a m s l and the average slope is 19 the stream is 10 km in length with an average gradient of 2 9 the width of the cross section at the sampling point is 3 m the geology is comprised of basic schist of the órdenes complex igme 1981 formed by biotite sometimes chlorite plagioclase and amphiboles the main soils in the catchment are umbrisols and cambisols iuss working group wrb 2015 characterized by acid ph 4 5 5 6 silt and silt loam texture and a high content of organic matter 4 4 10 5 in the soil surface layer the catchment is mainly rural with a mix of forest about 65 pastures 26 and cultivated land 4 with the rest occupied by impervious areas 5 showing a negligible change in land use and its distribution in the last decade the climate is humid temperate annual mean temperature is 13 c 1983 2008 with minimum and maximum mean temperatures occurring in january 8 c and august 19 c respectively annual mean rainfall is 1050 mm 1983 2008 mainly falling in autumn and winter 66 of the annual total the corbeira stream is characterised by a pluvial regime where maximum mean monthly discharges occur in winter while minimum discharges take place in summer mean daily streamflow discharge is low 0 2 m3 s 1 and mainly supplied by groundwater rodríguez blanco et al 2012 metals are transported within a very short time period thus the study of metal transport over 3 years indicated that about 45 of al fe and mn was transported during 4 of the time indicating that runoff events are the most important feature in terms of metal transport in the study area soto varela et al 2015 corbeira is an example of a natural system with little anthropogenic influence soto varela et al 2014 characterised by a limited sediment availability due to the dense vegetation cover however when the cultivated land is devoid of vegetation during intense rainfall storm events heavy erosion can occur and become an important source of sediment with high metal and nutrient loads delivered to the stream mostly associated with particulate material rodríguez blanco et al 2010 2013a b 2015 soto varela et al 2014 2015 corbeira catchment is a tributary of the mero river the main contributor of water and sediment to the abegondo cecebre reservoir the importance of this reservoir lies in its strategic and ecological relevance as it is the only source of drinking water for the approximately 450 000 inhabitants of the city of a coruña and its metropolitan area while also being a site of community importance included in the natura 2000 network a network of protected areas to halt the loss of biodiversity in the european union as the reservoir is located downstream from the catchment this study has implications for understanding the quality of its water since reservoirs generally act as sinks for catchment derived particles and a potential source of metallic load 2 2 instrumentation and sampling rainfall data were obtained from three recording tipping bucket rain gauges 0 2 mm resolution at 10 min intervals mean rainfall in the catchment was determined by the thiessen polygon method linsley et al 1949 the stream water level was measured continuously at the catchment outlet using a differential pressure transducer sensor isco 720 connected to an autosampler isco 6712 fs the stream water level was converted to discharge from the water level discharge relationship curve developed from a set of instantaneous discharge measurements performed at the monitoring station under different flow conditions and water levels the autosampler collected water samples during storm events from october 2004 to september 2008 in this study we assumed that particulate material concentrations are relatively homogenous in the sampling cross section so water samples were considered to be representative of average cross section characteristics the sampling site was located at the midpoint of the channel cross section where the homogeneity of water movement was considered representative of all hydrological conditions and where the particles and water were assumed to be well mixed during storm events the sampler was programmed to begin sample collection when the water level increased by 2 3 cm above the water level before the rainfall event and to collect water samples at user defined intervals throughout the events 1 8 h time intervals between samples varied depending on the type of event expected in order to ensure that water samples were taken during rising and recession limbs of the hydrograph to give representative values of metal transport during the storm events to avoid contamination all polyethylene sampling bottles were acid washed 10 hno3 for 24 h and rinsed with milli q water this procedure was repeated for each sampled event 2 3 laboratory analyses four metals al fe mn and cu were analysed total recoverable and dissolved metals were measured with an icp ms thermo scientific element xr high resolution thermo electron bremen according to the epa 200 8 method usepa 1994 total recoverable concentration was determined after performing an aqua regia digest with 1 ml hno3 and 3 ml hcl in a digestion block to determine dissolved concentration water samples were filtered through cellulose membrane filters with a pore size of 0 45 μm millipore billerica ma usa and acidified with ultrapure nitric acid to a ph lower than 2 the threshold of 0 45 µm was used to define the separation between dissolved and particulate fractions therefore the dissolved phase can include microparticulate material such as colloids and nanoparticles particulate or sediment associated metal concentrations were calculated from the difference between total recoverable and dissolved concentrations the external reproducibility of chemical preparation and icp measurements were performed on the three replicate samples resulting in standard deviations lower than 3 for total metals and less than 4 for dissolved metals accuracy and analytical precision were checked by an analysis of a multielemental standard solution from sigma aldrich fluka number 51844 and duplicate samples in each set recovery percentages were above 80 for all analysed metals 2 4 data analysis storm events were identified based on increases in discharge exceeding 1 5 times the discharge at the beginning of the rainfall event which is understood as being a rainfall episode following an interval of at least 10 h without precipitation this criterion allowed 93 storm events to be identified during the whole monitoring period some events were removed from the hysteresis analysis due to a storm events being required to have a minimum of two water samples collected on each limb of the hydrograph and one sample at or close to peak discharge to reflect the metal dynamics of the whole event b extreme complexity in their hydrological response multiple discharge peaks and c no clear type of hysteresis could be determined due to the relationship between metal concentration and discharge being difficult to define e g several peaks of metal concentrations consequently the hysteresis loops were only examined for 43 storm events for which a total of 477 paired c q data were recorded to classify the events in relation to their hysteretic loop a metal c q plot was drawn for each storm event the classification was made graphically according to some of the categories established by williams 1989 clockwise anticlockwise and figure eight hysteresis loops the hysteresis index hi according to lawler et al 2006 was also calculated this index enables quantification of the magnitude i e the width of the hysteretic loops and direction a clockwise loop induces a positive value of the hi while anticlockwise loops lead to a negative value of the hi of the hysteresis higher hi magnitudes in either direction indicate greater asynchronous behaviour between metal concentrations and discharge data were separated by hysteresis types to investigate the factors controlling metal concentration discharge hysteresis twelve hydro meteorological variables were used as potential controls for the variability of c q hysteresis during the storm events i rainfall variables total event rainfall p mm and maximum intensity imax mm h 1 ii antecedent condition variables accumulated precipitation from 1 ap1 mm 7 ap7 mm and 21 ap21 mm days before the event and the discharge before the event qb m3 s 1 and iii discharge variables maximum discharge qmax m3 s 1 mean discharge qmean m3 s 1 event duration d h flow intensity fi qmax qb time of rise runoff r mm and runoff coefficient rc the choice of these twelve variables aimed at capturing the hydro climatic variability of the storm events and the short and long term antecedent conditions is based on their importance as drivers for sediment discharge and nutrient discharge response at event scale in different catchments under varying climatic conditions butturini et al 2006 bowes et al 2015 sherriff et al 2016 and therefore is expected to affect the metal discharge response the event flow weighted mean concentration computed as total event metal load divided by the total flow of the storm event was selected as the metal response variable whereas hi was used as a response variable to describe hysteresis a positive index value would indicate clockwise hysteresis i e metal decline occurring throughout the hydrograph whereas negative values are indicative of less metal being transported during the rising limb of the hydrograph in comparison to the falling limb clockwise to anticlockwise hysteresis following evaluation of the descriptive statistics a principal component analysis was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the data and calculate new uncorrelated composite variables next stepwise regression was performed using the factor scores after a varimax rotation as explanatory variables to identify possible factors involved in metal hysteresis patterns for all analyses a uniform significance value of 0 05 was used all statistical analyses were carried out with the pasw statistics 18 for windows program package spss inc 3 results 3 1 event seasonal distribution and hydrological characteristics over the 43 selected storm events 22 occurred in autumn 15 in winter 4 in spring and only 2 in summer so that most of them took place during the wet season october march this distribution of events is representative of the number of events registered in each season since out of the total events recorded during the study period 93 approximately 70 occurred in autumn and winter qmax and runoff values for the selected events in each season almost matched those recorded for the whole of each season for example qmax values of all autumn and winter events ranged from 0 07 to 1 72 m3 s 1 and from 0 18 to 1 11 m3 s 1 respectively while the range of selected storm events varied between 0 13 and 1 62 m3 s 1 in autumn and between 0 18 and 1 11 m3 s 1 in winter the similarity between both ranges suggests that the selected events are representative of the hydrological characteristics of events recorded in each season 3 2 hysteresis patterns of events a highly variable relationship between metal concentration and discharge was found especially for sediment associated metals whose concentration varied by up to two orders of magnitude in the same discharge fig 2 the relationship between sediment associated metals and q and dissolved metals and q was not linear discharge only accounted for 33 48 of the total variance of sediment associated metals and 0 0 11 of dissolved metals fig 2 in all events consistent increases in all sediment associated and dissolved metals were observed with q but the increases varied greatly from one event to another and from metal to metal moreover a wide scatter in the data was observed this scatter in metal transport was attributed to the phenomenon of hysteresis caused by the metal c q relationship for sediment associated metals c q patterns were similar for all metals 56 of the events showed clockwise hysteresis 23 displayed figure eight hysteresis which were mainly clockwise at low discharge and anticlockwise at high discharge and 21 were classified as anticlockwise hysteresis fig 3 a for dissolved metals c q behaviour was also similar among metals for the majority of events 38 events 88 although changes in concentration over time are not necessarily consistent from one metal to another about 58 of events exhibited anticlockwise hysteresis 28 displayed figure eight hysteresis they all showed clockwise loops at low discharge and anticlockwise loops at high discharge and around 14 showed clockwise hysteresis fig 3a a summary of the characteristics of storm events grouped by hysteretic loops is given in table 1 examples of event hydrographs metal concentrations and hysteresis loops for each type of hysteresis are illustrated in fig 4 sediment associated metal load was dominated by clockwise hysteresis fig 3b this type contributed to about 70 of the event s particulate metal loads while figure eight and anticlockwise events exported 26 and 5 of the event sediment associated metal loads respectively fig 3b clockwise events occurred throughout the year although they were more common during the wettest periods i e in autumn and winter fig 5 this type of event was produced by moderate rainfall under relatively wet antecedent soil moisture conditions mean ap7 40 2 mm ap21 112 1 mm although clockwise hysteresis was also observed in storm events associated with low rainfall and dry soil moisture conditions table 1 the hydrological response of clockwise events represented by qmax and rc was larger than that for other types table 1 figure eight events were mainly recorded in the last year of the study 6 10 fig 5 especially in january 2008 40 of figure eight events they were generated under various soil moisture conditions e g ap21 ranged from 2 4 to 90 6 mm with a mean value of 42 5 mm by rainfall events of different magnitude p ranging from 7 6 to 62 8 mm generally characterized by rain on the falling limb of the hydrograph the hydrological response was moderate mean r 0 58 mm and consequently at times figure eight events produced large sediment associated metal loads fig 6 the figure eight events showed greater mean sediment associated concentrations compared to clockwise and anticlockwise events fig 6 however they were characterized by near zero hi fig 5 i e by narrow hysteresis loops anticlockwise events were generated by low rainfall mean p 13 7 mm under dry antecedent conditions mean ap21 38 4 mm which resulted in a limited hydrological response in the catchment and consequently in low sediment associated metal concentrations table 1 fig 6 so they only contributed to 4 5 of sediment associated metal loads as indicated above similar to the figure eight events anticlockwise events were observed in the last phase of the study period fig 5 for dissolved metals anticlockwise hysteresis contributed to the greatest part of fed 45 and mnd 49 loads fig 3b in contrast ald and cud loads were dominated by clockwise events which comprised only 14 of the total but contributed to 39 and 36 of ald and cud loads respectively fig 3b the clockwise events were characterized by higher rainfall mean p 38 8 40 0 mm and wetter antecedent conditions qb 0 28 0 34 m3 s 1 than those with other types of hysteresis and consequently the hydrological response was also greater than in other types of events table 1 in the corbeira catchment this behaviour was recorded during autumn and winter mainly during large floods e g 5 7 december 2006 and high ss concentration 500 mg l 1 events e g 22 october 2006 fig 5 causing significantly larger mean ald concentrations than in other types of events fig 6 fed and mnd showed the highest mean concentrations in anticlockwise events fig 6 figure eight events were also generated in autumn and winter by moderate rainfall events under high antecedent precipitation conditions mean ap21 ranging from 142 4 mm and 155 9 mm however the hydrological response was lower than that observed for clockwise events table 1 anticlockwise events were generated from low rainfall mean p 19 5 mm under drier conditions than other events table 1 although they were also registered in some large storms e g 2 november 2005 p 51 mm fig 5 3 3 controls of metal hysteresis patterns the pca was used in this study as a preliminary step to the stepwise regression to categorize the hydro meteorological variables in a small number of factors in order to simplify the subsequent data analysis the results indicated that there are four principal components that explain 82 4 of the total variance table 2 the highly weighted variables factor loading 0 60 for factor 1 49 2 of the variance were discharge at the beginning of an event maximum and mean discharge and flow intensity factor 2 17 5 of the variance was associated with rainfall amount duration and runoff whereas factor 3 9 1 of the variance showed high loading on antecedent precipitation lastly factor 4 6 6 of the variance only comprised the runoff coefficient stepwise regression on the factor scores versus hysteresis response hi shows that factor 1 and factor 2 table 3 were the most important for explaining the hysteresis response although there is relatively little explained variance 0 10 0 37 table 3 both factors were positively correlated to sediment associated and dissolved metal hysteresis hi for sediment associated metals factor 2 was significant in explaining the fe mn and cu hysteresis response high runoff which is a function of rainfall amount and soil moisture in the catchment rodríguez blanco et al 2012 led to greater particulate metal exhaustion high magnitude of clockwise hysteresis throughout the event the alp was mainly related to factor 1 which means that higher qmax and flow intensity increased particulate matter and led to higher particulate matter exhaustion during the hydrograph table 3 for alp factor 2 is significant in the second step of stepwise regression the hi for dissolved metals is mainly related to factor 1 indicating that as discharge and flow intensity increases dissolved metal exhaustion increases factor 2 is significant in the second step of stepwise regression for al fe and cu hysteresis table 3 revealing that high rainfall and runoff increase concentrations during the rising limb of the hydrograph 4 discussion an increase in the concentrations of sediment associated and dissolved metals in relation to pre event levels concentration effect was observed in all events indicating that metal delivery in the catchment is controlled by diffuse sources for sediment associated metals this behaviour comes from suspended solid mobilisation during the events thompson et al 2011 musolff et al 2015 while for dissolved metals it can be interpreted as the result of metal mobilisation from the upper soil via subsurface flow 4 1 hysteresis patterns of particulate metals different types of c q hysteresis have been observed for each metal during the study period indicating that there is no single relationship between these and stream q that can be used to predict metal concentrations from a known discharge additional factors such as metal levels source area magnitude and features of previous storm events the initial state of the catchment in particular the soil water content event specific characteristics rainfall amount runoff etc hydrological flow pathways and changes in the relative contribution of flow types surface runoff subsurface baseflow during the storm events might also contribute to the variability of metal concentrations shafer et al 1997 palleiro et al 2014a waeles et al 2015 el azzi et al 2016 peraza castro et al 2016 the sediment associated metal dynamics followed clockwise hysteresis due to readily adsorbed of metals onto fine sediment r 0 94 benoit et al 1994 cobelo garcía et al 2004 in several high ss concentration events e g 11 january 2008 fig 4 a lag between sediment associated metal concentrations and ss were observed as a storm event proceeded due to the inclusion of coarser grained material with lower metal concentrations than finer material horowitz and elrick 1987 miller and mackin 2013 unfortunately it is not possible to delve into this aspect because an analysis of the ss grain size was not performed however visual inspections of the residue retained in the filters used to determine the ss concentrations verified that samples characterised by higher ss concentrations exhibited larger proportions of coarser grain sediment the predominance of clockwise hysteresis in the corbeira catchment is in agreement with general findings in small sized catchments heidel 1956 williams 1989 and results from rapid mobilisation of easily eroded particles and associated metals from areas near to the channels once this easily eroded material is depleted particulate metal concentrations decrease resulting in lower concentrations for a given discharge during the falling limb of the hydrograph as compared with the rising limb the low metal particulate concentrations during the falling limb of large events in the study area were due not only to the reduction in the amount of available particles but also to dilution of concentrations of particulate material and consequently of particulate metals due to an increase in groundwater and subsurface flow during the falling limb of the hydrograph which is a common process in the study area rodríguez blanco et al 2012 palleiro et al 2014b during the smallest events clockwise hysteresis phenomena were primarily associated with resuspension of sediment from the riverbed during the rising limb of hydrograph forest tracks and roads unpaved and paved i e low permeability zones that favour generation of surface runoff promote clockwise patterns fig 5 the broad hysteresis loops i e with higher hi usually occurred in high ss concentration episodes caused by heavy high intensity rainfall events in these cases surface runoff and soil erosion in cultivated land played an important role in mobilising large amounts of particulate material which was transferred from the soil to stream water by surface runoff with the highest particulate metal concentrations reached before peak discharge during some of these high ss concentration episodes e g 1 3 december 2006 the field observations showed that the particulate material was derived mainly from erosion of cultivated lands adjacent to the stream but distant from the catchment outlet so the clockwise loops observed in these events were linked to the supply of particulate matter from sources far away from the monitoring station as opposed to what is usually stated in the literature steegen et al 2000 also related the clockwise hysteresis loops with the supply of sediment from distant hillslope sources since it is more likely for this sediment to be deposited upstream during its longer journey to the catchment outlet clockwise to a drop in lower concentrations on the falling limb of the hydrograph the high energy and high stream discharge from these events may also erode banks thus enhancing a clockwise hysteresis response in the last stage of the studied period the sediment associated metal hysteresis dynamics altered to become dominated by anticlockwise and figure eight events with only 3 3 18 events registered with clockwise hysteresis a particular feature of the weather from this period from march to december 2007 476 mm that it was extremely dry with 50 lower rainfall than normal for the area mean 1983 2008 848 mm while from january to may 2008 it was very wet 689 mm with rainfall exceeding the long term average mean 1983 2008 477 mm which could be responsible for this altered behaviour since there have been no significant changes in the land use and management in the catchment during relatively dry conditions and low runoff hysteresis responses were predominantly anticlockwise this type of hysteresis has been interpreted in many different ways thus it has been linked to the arrival of particles from sources distant from the channel peraza castro et al 2016 such as soil erosion on the hillslopes or in the upper parts of the catchments although they can also be caused by processes with slower dynamics such as bank collapse rinaldi et al 2004 in the corbeira catchment bank collapse is not frequent and even rarer if taking into account the low rainfall caused by these events this phenomenon only occurs in large events with high energy and high stream discharge on the other hand events with anticlockwise hysteresis were not erosive so this process must also be discarded all this leads to suppose that anticlockwise hysteresis observed in some storm events can be associated with the arrival of particles from a sediment source distant from the sampling station figure eight hysteresis was observed in events of varying magnitudes registered under wet antecedent conditions which followed closely on another event under continuous heavy rainfall such as that recorded in january 2008 the catchment can be expected to experience increased surface soil erosion due to greater hydrological connectivity driven by high soil moisture conditions and greater influence from wider catchment scale processes under these conditions the particulate material sources become widespread throughout the catchment and the particles can be delivered from areas that are not constantly connected to the stream network therefore the figure eight hysteresis can be indicative of the contribution from different particle sources within the catchment area at low discharge the clockwise loops may be caused by the delivery and depletion of material from sources near to the stream while some particle sources may connect to the stream network later and drive anticlockwise partial hysteresis at high discharge in the specific case of the 10 12 january 2008 storm event fig 4 which reached the highest mean particulate metal concentrations in the study period alp 5100 μg l 1 fep 6600 μg l 1 mnp 200 μg l 1 cup 5 μg l 1 the field research observed concentrated flow erosion in cultivated land located in several zones of the catchment delivering particulate material and associated metals from different areas of the catchment where connectivity coincided with source availability the foregoing suggests that the location of particulate source and the connectivity to the channel network may be important factors in explaining the hysteresis patterns in the study area 4 2 hysteresis patterns of dissolved metals the most common response pattern observed for dissolved metals in this study was anticlockwise hysteresis suggesting a different transport mechanism from the sediment associated metal probably linked to doc r 0 68 for ald fed and cud due to the heavy influence of organic matter in the transfer of dissolved metals especially fe and cu in the study area palleiro et al 2014c soto varela et al 2014 the transport of dissolved metals associated with the subsurface flow is probably the main mechanism in explaining the predominance of anticlockwise responses in the catchment as has been often reported in temperate catchments webb et al 1987 el azzi et al 2016 another explanation for the anticlockwise pattern is the arrival of metals from distant sources to the stream peraza castro et al 2016 however it does not seem to account for higher concentrations during the falling limb of the hydrograph since in storm events with anticlockwise patterns for particulate and dissolved metals the dissolved metal peak was reached with a time delay following the trend presented by doc this indicates that despite a similar temporal pattern of delivery of both fractions to the stream the flow paths may be different surface runoff for particulate and subsurface for dissolved during some events the dissolved metals followed clockwise hysteresis like those of particulate metals suggesting a common origin and or mechanism transport for both metal fractions dissolved and particulate metals clockwise hysteresis patterns for dissolved metals have been frequently related with a major contribution from surface runoff due to the rapid flushing of metals solubilised from the upper soil horizons during the rising limb of the hydrograph nagorski et al 2003 ollivier et al 2011 roussiez et al 2013 waeles et al 2015 our data show that events displaying clockwise hysteresis loops were high magnitude events so rapid movement of water organic matter and particles to the channel via overland flow might be an important mechanism clockwise to high particulate and dissolved metal concentrations on the rising limb of the hydrograph these events were usually characterised by high ss concentrations and hence the presence of colloidal particles is more likely this might favour the transport of metals in colloidal form either complexed with doc or as oxyhydroxides which could be measured as dissolved elements because in this study the dissolved metals were defined on an operational basis as any substance that passes through a 0 45 μm filter it is well established in the literature that colloids interact strongly with dissolved metals and can be major transport vectors for metals such as al fe and cu ross and sherrell 1999 hill and aplin 2001 which could explain the high contribution of clockwise events to total ald and cud loads 39 and 36 respectively in events even though clockwise events comprised only 14 of the total in other high magnitude episodes in which dissolved metals showed a similar pattern clockwise to that of particulate metals a delay in the arrival of doc and dissolved metals to the stream was observed so a strong affinity of dissolved metals for doc in the study area soto varela et al 2014 may be responsible for the short lag between sediment associated particulate and dissolved metals in these events 5 conclusions this paper shows the hysteresis patterns of sediment associated and dissolved metals in a headwater rural catchment derived from high frequency monitoring of storm events consistent increases in all sediment associated and dissolved metals were observed with discharge concentration effect but these varied greatly from one event to another and between metals a variety of hysteresis patterns for both sediment associated and dissolved metals including clockwise anticlockwise and figure eight hysteresis was identified and related to the complex interaction of many determining factors such as the location of main particle sources close to the stream network and changes in the relative contribution of different flows surface runoff subsurface and baseflow during the storm events for sediment associated metals the dynamic was dominated by clockwise hysteresis indicating that the source of sediment associated metals close to the river network was easily mobilised and exhausted by individual events surface runoff soil erosion and the connectivity between the source area and the drainage network were seemingly contributing factors to control the transfer of sediment associated metals the most common response pattern observed for dissolved metals was anticlockwise hysteresis suggesting that dissolved metals were transferred to the stream via subsurface flow whose contribution is highest at the beginning of the falling limb of the hydrographs the different flushing mechanisms between sediment associated and dissolved metals imply that different catchment management strategies should be implemented for the control of metal export however given that the metals in this catchment are transported mainly in the particulate fraction it seems most appropriate to focus on strategies aimed at this fraction accordingly management practices targeted on decreasing runoff and especially soil erosion in cultivated land could be effective in significantly reducing metal export and consequently the metal delivery to the reservoir located downstream thus improving water quality the results of this study have implications for catchment scale metal modelling approaches aimed at estimating metal yield and to infer changes in the behaviour of metals in the water environment under climate change scenarios given that extreme weather events seem likely to become more common in a warmer world it will be increasingly important to monitor metal dynamics during and after extreme episodes to seek to understand how metal behaviour in the water environment might respond to climate change which may facilitate decisions in ecosystem

6988,understanding the metal dynamics in natural waters is critical to assessing the process and flow pathways that deliver these constituents to the stream network metal dynamics can be addressed by an analysis of concentration discharge relationship across a large spectrum of hydrological conditions however metal discharge responses have only been studied in detail for short periods or a few selected events in this study a detailed analysis of the hysteresis loops exhibited by metal concentration discharge relationship was undertaken to assess the al fe mn and cu dynamics and factors controlling changes in metal concentrations in a small scale rural catchment metal sediment associated and dissolved concentrations were measured at high temporal resolution during storm events in a small rural headwater catchment in galicia nw spain hysteresis analysis indicated a contrasting concentration discharge dynamic for sediment associated and dissolved metals highlighting a strong decoupling between the two due to their different sources or delivery pathways for sediment associated metals clockwise hysteresis 56 was the predominant pattern highlighting the rapid sediment associated metal mobilisation via surface runoff from sources located near the stream channel in contrast dissolved metal showed predominantly anticlockwise hysteresis 58 of storm events emphasising the role of subsurface flow and soil leaching processes the different flushing mechanisms between sediment associated and dissolved metals imply that different catchment management strategies should be implemented for the control of metal export keywords sediment associated and dissolved metals concentration discharge relationship storm events rural headwater catchment humid temperate climate 1 introduction metals are among the most common environmental contaminants and their presence in waters and biota may be due to natural and or anthropogenic sources the main natural sources of metals in the waters come from chemical weathering of minerals and soil leaching salomons and förstner 1984 anthropogenic sources are mainly associated with domestic and industrial wastewaters urban storm water runoff atmospheric sources mining and rural area inputs kabata pendias and szteke 2015 particularly in rural catchments erosion and runoff from agricultural soils may be a major source of metals in watercourses when inorganic and or organic e g slurry fertilisers are applied relatively frequently since metals are present in these taboada castro et al 2012a b el azzi et al 2016 most metals are transported in association with suspended sediment ss given the affinity of the metals to the common components of suspended particles such as iron oxyhydroxides natural organic matter and clay minerals horowitz 1991 miller et al 2003 viers et al 2009 dumas et al 2015 however changes in physico chemical conditions of the medium can cause them to mobilise in the dissolved form and become more bioavailable brunel et al 2003 roussiez et al 2013 the form and quantity of metals passing through a sampling station in a given time depends on a large number of factors and processes that act simultaneously and successively in the mobilisation transfer and storage of metals among the main factors are physico chemical characteristics of the metals catchment lithology shafer et al 1997 huser

into the dynamics of metals in this context interpretation of concentration discharge c q hysteresis can provide information on the spatial and temporal dynamics of metal sources and hydrological pathways williams 1989 evans and davies 1998 waeles et al 2015 el azzi et al 2016 the hysteresis represents a condition in which element concentration for a given discharge differs between the rising and falling limb of the hydrograph which happens because the peak discharge and the element do not occur at the same time williams 1989 evans and davies 1998 clockwise c q hysteresis describes solute or particulate concentrations rising as discharge increase reaching typically higher concentrations during the rising limb than during the falling limb of the hydrograph due to rapid mobilisation and exhaustion of solutes or particulate material from within or near sources to the stream williams 1989 nagorski et al 2003 miller 2016 this pattern often called first flush phenomenon is also attributed to flushing effects at the onset of the storm events when rainfall in the catchment leads to displacement of soil water into the stream channel piñol et al 1992 sokolov and black 1996 in contrast anticlockwise c q hysteresis is frequently related to a delayed subsurface response or to solute or particulate delivery from distant sources williams 1989 evans and davies 1998 el azzi et al

particularly in headwater catchments with minimal human impact nagorski et al 2003 miller 2016 even though in relatively pristine areas low metal concentrations may also have important consequences for the functioning of the aquatic environment because of their potential toxicity to biota huser et al 2011 the general objective of this paper was to understand the temporal dynamic of metal concentrations and fluxes in a small headwater catchment in nw spain more specifically objectives were to i identify and classify the different types of metal al fe mn and cu c q hysteresis at storm event scale and ii evaluate how different factors can explain the hysteresis loops by studying the relationship between hydro climatic parameters and metal concentration dynamics to achieve these objectives discharge and dissolved and particulate metal data were collected at high frequency during storm events in the corbeira catchment galicia nw spain over four consecutive hydrological years 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study focused on the corbeira catchment a small rural catchment 16 km2 located in the upper reaches of the mero river basin near the city of a coruña nw spain fig 1 the mean elevation of the catchment is about 267 m a m s l min 60 m a m s l max 470 m a m s l and the average slope is 19 the stream is 10 km in length with an average gradient of 2 9 the width of the cross section at the sampling point is 3 m the geology is comprised of basic schist of the órdenes complex igme 1981 formed by biotite sometimes chlorite plagioclase and amphiboles the main soils in the catchment are umbrisols and cambisols iuss working group wrb 2015 characterized by acid ph 4 5 5 6 silt and silt loam texture and a high content of organic matter 4 4 10 5 in the soil surface layer the catchment is mainly rural with a mix of forest about 65 pastures 26 and cultivated land 4 with the rest occupied by impervious areas 5 showing a negligible change in land use and its distribution in the last decade the climate is humid temperate annual mean temperature is 13 c 1983 2008 with minimum and maximum mean temperatures occurring in january 8 c and august 19 c respectively annual mean rainfall is 1050 mm 1983 2008 mainly falling in autumn and winter 66 of the annual total the corbeira stream is characterised by a pluvial regime where maximum mean monthly discharges occur in winter while minimum discharges take place in summer mean daily streamflow discharge is low 0 2 m3 s 1 and mainly supplied by groundwater rodríguez blanco et al 2012 metals are transported within a very short time period thus the study of metal transport over 3 years indicated that about 45 of al fe and mn was transported during 4 of the time indicating that runoff events are the most important feature in terms of metal transport in the study area soto varela et al 2015 corbeira is an example of a natural system with little anthropogenic influence soto varela et al 2014 characterised by a limited sediment availability due to the dense vegetation cover however when the cultivated land is devoid of vegetation during intense rainfall storm events heavy erosion can occur and become an important source of sediment with high metal and nutrient loads delivered to the stream mostly associated with particulate material rodríguez blanco et al 2010 2013a b 2015 soto varela et al 2014 2015 corbeira catchment is a tributary of the mero river the main contributor of water and sediment to the abegondo cecebre reservoir the importance of this reservoir lies in its strategic and ecological relevance as it is the only source of drinking water for the approximately 450 000 inhabitants of the city of a coruña and its metropolitan area while also being a site of community importance included in the natura 2000 network a network of protected areas to halt the loss of biodiversity in the european union as the reservoir is located downstream from the catchment this study has implications for understanding the quality of its water since reservoirs generally act as sinks for catchment derived particles and a potential source of metallic load 2 2 instrumentation and sampling rainfall data were obtained from three recording tipping bucket rain gauges 0 2 mm resolution at 10 min intervals mean rainfall in the catchment was determined by the thiessen polygon method linsley et al 1949 the stream water level was measured continuously at the catchment outlet using a differential pressure transducer sensor isco 720 connected to an autosampler isco 6712 fs the stream water level was converted to discharge from the water level discharge relationship curve developed from a set of instantaneous discharge measurements performed at the monitoring station under different flow conditions and water levels the autosampler collected water samples during storm events from october 2004 to september 2008 in this study we assumed that particulate material concentrations are relatively homogenous in the sampling cross section so water samples were considered to be representative of average cross section characteristics the sampling site was located at the midpoint of the channel cross section where the homogeneity of water movement was considered representative of all hydrological conditions and where the particles and water were assumed to be well mixed during storm events the sampler was programmed to begin sample collection when the water level increased by 2 3 cm above the water level before the rainfall event and to collect water samples at user defined intervals throughout the events 1 8 h time intervals between samples varied depending on the type of event expected in order to ensure that water samples were taken during rising and recession limbs of the hydrograph to give representative values of metal transport during the storm events to avoid contamination all polyethylene sampling bottles were acid washed 10 hno3 for 24 h and rinsed with milli q water this procedure was repeated for each sampled event 2 3 laboratory analyses four metals al fe mn and cu were analysed total recoverable and dissolved metals were measured with an icp ms thermo scientific element xr high resolution thermo electron bremen according to the epa 200 8 method usepa 1994 total recoverable concentration was determined after performing an aqua regia digest with 1 ml hno3 and 3 ml hcl in a digestion block to determine dissolved concentration water samples were filtered through cellulose membrane filters with a pore size of 0 45 μm millipore billerica ma usa and acidified with ultrapure nitric acid to a ph lower than 2 the threshold of 0 45 µm was used to define the separation between dissolved and particulate fractions therefore the dissolved phase can include microparticulate material such as colloids and nanoparticles particulate or sediment associated metal concentrations were calculated from the difference between total recoverable and dissolved concentrations the external reproducibility of chemical preparation and icp measurements were performed on the three replicate samples resulting in standard deviations lower than 3 for total metals and less than 4 for dissolved metals accuracy and analytical precision were checked by an analysis of a multielemental standard solution from sigma aldrich fluka number 51844 and duplicate samples in each set recovery percentages were above 80 for all analysed metals 2 4 data analysis storm events were identified based on increases in discharge exceeding 1 5 times the discharge at the beginning of the rainfall event which is understood as being a rainfall episode following an interval of at least 10 h without precipitation this criterion allowed 93 storm events to be identified during the whole monitoring period some events were removed from the hysteresis analysis due to a storm events being required to have a minimum of two water samples collected on each limb of the hydrograph and one sample at or close to peak discharge to reflect the metal dynamics of the whole event b extreme complexity in their hydrological response multiple discharge peaks and c no clear type of hysteresis could be determined due to the relationship between metal concentration and discharge being difficult to define e g several peaks of metal concentrations consequently the hysteresis loops were only examined for 43 storm events for which a total of 477 paired c q data were recorded to classify the events in relation to their hysteretic loop a metal c q plot was drawn for each storm event the classification was made graphically according to some of the categories established by williams 1989 clockwise anticlockwise and figure eight hysteresis loops the hysteresis index hi according to lawler et al 2006 was also calculated this index enables quantification of the magnitude i e the width of the hysteretic loops and direction a clockwise loop induces a positive value of the hi while anticlockwise loops lead to a negative value of the hi of the hysteresis higher hi magnitudes in either direction indicate greater asynchronous behaviour between metal concentrations and discharge data were separated by hysteresis types to investigate the factors controlling metal concentration discharge hysteresis twelve hydro meteorological variables were used as potential controls for the variability of c q hysteresis during the storm events i rainfall variables total event rainfall p mm and maximum intensity imax mm h 1 ii antecedent condition variables accumulated precipitation from 1 ap1 mm 7 ap7 mm and 21 ap21 mm days before the event and the discharge before the event qb m3 s 1 and iii discharge variables maximum discharge qmax m3 s 1 mean discharge qmean m3 s 1 event duration d h flow intensity fi qmax qb time of rise runoff r mm and runoff coefficient rc the choice of these twelve variables aimed at capturing the hydro climatic variability of the storm events and the short and long term antecedent conditions is based on their importance as drivers for sediment discharge and nutrient discharge response at event scale in different catchments under varying climatic conditions butturini et al 2006 bowes et al 2015 sherriff et al 2016 and therefore is expected to affect the metal discharge response the event flow weighted mean concentration computed as total event metal load divided by the total flow of the storm event was selected as the metal response variable whereas hi was used as a response variable to describe hysteresis a positive index value would indicate clockwise hysteresis i e metal decline occurring throughout the hydrograph whereas negative values are indicative of less metal being transported during the rising limb of the hydrograph in comparison to the falling limb clockwise to anticlockwise hysteresis following evaluation of the descriptive statistics a principal component analysis was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the data and calculate new uncorrelated composite variables next stepwise regression was performed using the factor scores after a varimax rotation as explanatory variables to identify possible factors involved in metal hysteresis patterns for all analyses a uniform significance value of 0 05 was used all statistical analyses were carried out with the pasw statistics 18 for windows program package spss inc 3 results 3 1 event seasonal distribution and hydrological characteristics over the 43 selected storm events 22 occurred in autumn 15 in winter 4 in spring and only 2 in summer so that most of them took place during the wet season october march this distribution of events is representative of the number of events registered in each season since out of the total events recorded during the study period 93 approximately 70 occurred in autumn and winter qmax and runoff values for the selected events in each season almost matched those recorded for the whole of each season for example qmax values of all autumn and winter events ranged from 0 07 to 1 72 m3 s 1 and from 0 18 to 1 11 m3 s 1 respectively while the range of selected storm events varied between 0 13 and 1 62 m3 s 1 in autumn and between 0 18 and 1 11 m3 s 1 in winter the similarity between both ranges suggests that the selected events are representative of the hydrological characteristics of events recorded in each season 3 2 hysteresis patterns of events a highly variable relationship between metal concentration and discharge was found especially for sediment associated metals whose concentration varied by up to two orders of magnitude in the same discharge fig 2 the relationship between sediment associated metals and q and dissolved metals and q was not linear discharge only accounted for 33 48 of the total variance of sediment associated metals and 0 0 11 of dissolved metals fig 2 in all events consistent increases in all sediment associated and dissolved metals were observed with q but the increases varied greatly from one event to another and from metal to metal moreover a wide scatter in the data was observed this scatter in metal transport was attributed to the phenomenon of hysteresis caused by the metal c q relationship for sediment associated metals c q patterns were similar for all metals 56 of the events showed clockwise hysteresis 23 displayed figure eight hysteresis which were mainly clockwise at low discharge and anticlockwise at high discharge and 21 were classified as anticlockwise hysteresis fig 3 a for dissolved metals c q behaviour was also similar among metals for the majority of events 38 events 88 although changes in concentration over time are not necessarily consistent from one metal to another about 58 of events exhibited anticlockwise hysteresis 28 displayed figure eight hysteresis they all showed clockwise loops at low discharge and anticlockwise loops at high discharge and around 14 showed clockwise hysteresis fig 3a a summary of the characteristics of storm events grouped by hysteretic loops is given in table 1 examples of event hydrographs metal concentrations and hysteresis loops for each type of hysteresis are illustrated in fig 4 sediment associated metal load was dominated by clockwise hysteresis fig 3b this type contributed to about 70 of the event s particulate metal loads while figure eight and anticlockwise events exported 26 and 5 of the event sediment associated metal loads respectively fig 3b clockwise events occurred throughout the year although they were more common during the wettest periods i e in autumn and winter fig 5 this type of event was produced by moderate rainfall under relatively wet antecedent soil moisture conditions mean ap7 40 2 mm ap21 112 1 mm although clockwise hysteresis was also observed in storm events associated with low rainfall and dry soil moisture conditions table 1 the hydrological response of clockwise events represented by qmax and rc was larger than that for other types table 1 figure eight events were mainly recorded in the last year of the study 6 10 fig 5 especially in january 2008 40 of figure eight events they were generated under various soil moisture conditions e g ap21 ranged from 2 4 to 90 6 mm with a mean value of 42 5 mm by rainfall events of different magnitude p ranging from 7 6 to 62 8 mm generally characterized by rain on the falling limb of the hydrograph the hydrological response was moderate mean r 0 58 mm and consequently at times figure eight events produced large sediment associated metal loads fig 6 the figure eight events showed greater mean sediment associated concentrations compared to clockwise and anticlockwise events fig 6 however they were characterized by near zero hi fig 5 i e by narrow hysteresis loops anticlockwise events were generated by low rainfall mean p 13 7 mm under dry antecedent conditions mean ap21 38 4 mm which resulted in a limited hydrological response in the catchment and consequently in low sediment associated metal concentrations table 1 fig 6 so they only contributed to 4 5 of sediment associated metal loads as indicated above similar to the figure eight events anticlockwise events were observed in the last phase of the study period fig 5 for dissolved metals anticlockwise hysteresis contributed to the greatest part of fed 45 and mnd 49 loads fig 3b in contrast ald and cud loads were dominated by clockwise events which comprised only 14 of the total but contributed to 39 and 36 of ald and cud loads respectively fig 3b the clockwise events were characterized by higher rainfall mean p 38 8 40 0 mm and wetter antecedent conditions qb 0 28 0 34 m3 s 1 than those with other types of hysteresis and consequently the hydrological response was also greater than in other types of events table 1 in the corbeira catchment this behaviour was recorded during autumn and winter mainly during large floods e g 5 7 december 2006 and high ss concentration 500 mg l 1 events e g 22 october 2006 fig 5 causing significantly larger mean ald concentrations than in other types of events fig 6 fed and mnd showed the highest mean concentrations in anticlockwise events fig 6 figure eight events were also generated in autumn and winter by moderate rainfall events under high antecedent precipitation conditions mean ap21 ranging from 142 4 mm and 155 9 mm however the hydrological response was lower than that observed for clockwise events table 1 anticlockwise events were generated from low rainfall mean p 19 5 mm under drier conditions than other events table 1 although they were also registered in some large storms e g 2 november 2005 p 51 mm fig 5 3 3 controls of metal hysteresis patterns the pca was used in this study as a preliminary step to the stepwise regression to categorize the hydro meteorological variables in a small number of factors in order to simplify the subsequent data analysis the results indicated that there are four principal components that explain 82 4 of the total variance table 2 the highly weighted variables factor loading 0 60 for factor 1 49 2 of the variance were discharge at the beginning of an event maximum and mean discharge and flow intensity factor 2 17 5 of the variance was associated with rainfall amount duration and runoff whereas factor 3 9 1 of the variance showed high loading on antecedent precipitation lastly factor 4 6 6 of the variance only comprised the runoff coefficient stepwise regression on the factor scores versus hysteresis response hi shows that factor 1 and factor 2 table 3 were the most important for explaining the hysteresis response although there is relatively little explained variance 0 10 0 37 table 3 both factors were positively correlated to sediment associated and dissolved metal hysteresis hi for sediment associated metals factor 2 was significant in explaining the fe mn and cu hysteresis response high runoff which is a function of rainfall amount and soil moisture in the catchment rodríguez blanco et al 2012 led to greater particulate metal exhaustion high magnitude of clockwise hysteresis throughout the event the alp was mainly related to factor 1 which means that higher qmax and flow intensity increased particulate matter and led to higher particulate matter exhaustion during the hydrograph table 3 for alp factor 2 is significant in the second step of stepwise regression the hi for dissolved metals is mainly related to factor 1 indicating that as discharge and flow intensity increases dissolved metal exhaustion increases factor 2 is significant in the second step of stepwise regression for al fe and cu hysteresis table 3 revealing that high rainfall and runoff increase concentrations during the rising limb of the hydrograph 4 discussion an increase in the concentrations of sediment associated and dissolved metals in relation to pre event levels concentration effect was observed in all events indicating that metal delivery in the catchment is controlled by diffuse sources for sediment associated metals this behaviour comes from suspended solid mobilisation during the events thompson et al 2011 musolff et al 2015 while for dissolved metals it can be interpreted as the result of metal mobilisation from the upper soil via subsurface flow 4 1 hysteresis patterns of particulate metals different types of c q hysteresis have been observed for each metal during the study period indicating that there is no single relationship between these and stream q that can be used to predict metal concentrations from a known discharge additional factors such as metal levels source area magnitude and features of previous storm events the initial state of the catchment in particular the soil water content event specific characteristics rainfall amount runoff etc hydrological flow pathways and changes in the relative contribution of flow types surface runoff subsurface baseflow during the storm events might also contribute to the variability of metal concentrations shafer et al 1997 palleiro et al 2014a waeles et al 2015 el azzi et al 2016 peraza castro et al 2016 the sediment associated metal dynamics followed clockwise hysteresis due to readily adsorbed of metals onto fine sediment r 0 94 benoit et al 1994 cobelo garcía et al 2004 in several high ss concentration events e g 11 january 2008 fig 4 a lag between sediment associated metal concentrations and ss were observed as a storm event proceeded due to the inclusion of coarser grained material with lower metal concentrations than finer material horowitz and elrick 1987 miller and mackin 2013 unfortunately it is not possible to delve into this aspect because an analysis of the ss grain size was not performed however visual inspections of the residue retained in the filters used to determine the ss concentrations verified that samples characterised by higher ss concentrations exhibited larger proportions of coarser grain sediment the predominance of clockwise hysteresis in the corbeira catchment is in agreement with general findings in small sized catchments heidel 1956 williams 1989 and results from rapid mobilisation of easily eroded particles and associated metals from areas near to the channels once this easily eroded material is depleted particulate metal concentrations decrease resulting in lower concentrations for a given discharge during the falling limb of the hydrograph as compared with the rising limb the low metal particulate concentrations during the falling limb of large events in the study area were due not only to the reduction in the amount of available particles but also to dilution of concentrations of particulate material and consequently of particulate metals due to an increase in groundwater and subsurface flow during the falling limb of the hydrograph which is a common process in the study area rodríguez blanco et al 2012 palleiro et al 2014b during the smallest events clockwise hysteresis phenomena were primarily associated with resuspension of sediment from the riverbed during the rising limb of hydrograph forest tracks and roads unpaved and paved i e low permeability zones that favour generation of surface runoff promote clockwise patterns fig 5 the broad hysteresis loops i e with higher hi usually occurred in high ss concentration episodes caused by heavy high intensity rainfall events in these cases surface runoff and soil erosion in cultivated land played an important role in mobilising large amounts of particulate material which was transferred from the soil to stream water by surface runoff with the highest particulate metal concentrations reached before peak discharge during some of these high ss concentration episodes e g 1 3 december 2006 the field observations showed that the particulate material was derived mainly from erosion of cultivated lands adjacent to the stream but distant from the catchment outlet so the clockwise loops observed in these events were linked to the supply of particulate matter from sources far away from the monitoring station as opposed to what is usually stated in the literature steegen et al 2000 also related the clockwise hysteresis loops with the supply of sediment from distant hillslope sources since it is more likely for this sediment to be deposited upstream during its longer journey to the catchment outlet clockwise to a drop in lower concentrations on the falling limb of the hydrograph the high energy and high stream discharge from these events may also erode banks thus enhancing a clockwise hysteresis response in the last stage of the studied period the sediment associated metal hysteresis dynamics altered to become dominated by anticlockwise and figure eight events with only 3 3 18 events registered with clockwise hysteresis a particular feature of the weather from this period from march to december 2007 476 mm that it was extremely dry with 50 lower rainfall than normal for the area mean 1983 2008 848 mm while from january to may 2008 it was very wet 689 mm with rainfall exceeding the long term average mean 1983 2008 477 mm which could be responsible for this altered behaviour since there have been no significant changes in the land use and management in the catchment during relatively dry conditions and low runoff hysteresis responses were predominantly anticlockwise this type of hysteresis has been interpreted in many different ways thus it has been linked to the arrival of particles from sources distant from the channel peraza castro et al 2016 such as soil erosion on the hillslopes or in the upper parts of the catchments although they can also be caused by processes with slower dynamics such as bank collapse rinaldi et al 2004 in the corbeira catchment bank collapse is not frequent and even rarer if taking into account the low rainfall caused by these events this phenomenon only occurs in large events with high energy and high stream discharge on the other hand events with anticlockwise hysteresis were not erosive so this process must also be discarded all this leads to suppose that anticlockwise hysteresis observed in some storm events can be associated with the arrival of particles from a sediment source distant from the sampling station figure eight hysteresis was observed in events of varying magnitudes registered under wet antecedent conditions which followed closely on another event under continuous heavy rainfall such as that recorded in january 2008 the catchment can be expected to experience increased surface soil erosion due to greater hydrological connectivity driven by high soil moisture conditions and greater influence from wider catchment scale processes under these conditions the particulate material sources become widespread throughout the catchment and the particles can be delivered from areas that are not constantly connected to the stream network therefore the figure eight hysteresis can be indicative of the contribution from different particle sources within the catchment area at low discharge the clockwise loops may be caused by the delivery and depletion of material from sources near to the stream while some particle sources may connect to the stream network later and drive anticlockwise partial hysteresis at high discharge in the specific case of the 10 12 january 2008 storm event fig 4 which reached the highest mean particulate metal concentrations in the study period alp 5100 μg l 1 fep 6600 μg l 1 mnp 200 μg l 1 cup 5 μg l 1 the field research observed concentrated flow erosion in cultivated land located in several zones of the catchment delivering particulate material and associated metals from different areas of the catchment where connectivity coincided with source availability the foregoing suggests that the location of particulate source and the connectivity to the channel network may be important factors in explaining the hysteresis patterns in the study area 4 2 hysteresis patterns of dissolved metals the most common response pattern observed for dissolved metals in this study was anticlockwise hysteresis suggesting a different transport mechanism from the sediment associated metal probably linked to doc r 0 68 for ald fed and cud due to the heavy influence of organic matter in the transfer of dissolved metals especially fe and cu in the study area palleiro et al 2014c soto varela et al 2014 the transport of dissolved metals associated with the subsurface flow is probably the main mechanism in explaining the predominance of anticlockwise responses in the catchment as has been often reported in temperate catchments webb et al 1987 el azzi et al 2016 another explanation for the anticlockwise pattern is the arrival of metals from distant sources to the stream peraza castro et al 2016 however it does not seem to account for higher concentrations during the falling limb of the hydrograph since in storm events with anticlockwise patterns for particulate and dissolved metals the dissolved metal peak was reached with a time delay following the trend presented by doc this indicates that despite a similar temporal pattern of delivery of both fractions to the stream the flow paths may be different surface runoff for particulate and subsurface for dissolved during some events the dissolved metals followed clockwise hysteresis like those of particulate metals suggesting a common origin and or mechanism transport for both metal fractions dissolved and particulate metals clockwise hysteresis patterns for dissolved metals have been frequently related with a major contribution from surface runoff due to the rapid flushing of metals solubilised from the upper soil horizons during the rising limb of the hydrograph nagorski et al 2003 ollivier et al 2011 roussiez et al 2013 waeles et al 2015 our data show that events displaying clockwise hysteresis loops were high magnitude events so rapid movement of water organic matter and particles to the channel via overland flow might be an important mechanism clockwise to high particulate and dissolved metal concentrations on the rising limb of the hydrograph these events were usually characterised by high ss concentrations and hence the presence of colloidal particles is more likely this might favour the transport of metals in colloidal form either complexed with doc or as oxyhydroxides which could be measured as dissolved elements because in this study the dissolved metals were defined on an operational basis as any substance that passes through a 0 45 μm filter it is well established in the literature that colloids interact strongly with dissolved metals and can be major transport vectors for metals such as al fe and cu ross and sherrell 1999 hill and aplin 2001 which could explain the high contribution of clockwise events to total ald and cud loads 39 and 36 respectively in events even though clockwise events comprised only 14 of the total in other high magnitude episodes in which dissolved metals showed a similar pattern clockwise to that of particulate metals a delay in the arrival of doc and dissolved metals to the stream was observed so a strong affinity of dissolved metals for doc in the study area soto varela et al 2014 may be responsible for the short lag between sediment associated particulate and dissolved metals in these events 5 conclusions this paper shows the hysteresis patterns of sediment associated and dissolved metals in a headwater rural catchment derived from high frequency monitoring of storm events consistent increases in all sediment associated and dissolved metals were observed with discharge concentration effect but these varied greatly from one event to another and between metals a variety of hysteresis patterns for both sediment associated and dissolved metals including clockwise anticlockwise and figure eight hysteresis was identified and related to the complex interaction of many determining factors such as the location of main particle sources close to the stream network and changes in the relative contribution of different flows surface runoff subsurface and baseflow during the storm events for sediment associated metals the dynamic was dominated by clockwise hysteresis indicating that the source of sediment associated metals close to the river network was easily mobilised and exhausted by individual events surface runoff soil erosion and the connectivity between the source area and the drainage network were seemingly contributing factors to control the transfer of sediment associated metals the most common response pattern observed for dissolved metals was anticlockwise hysteresis suggesting that dissolved metals were transferred to the stream via subsurface flow whose contribution is highest at the beginning of the falling limb of the hydrographs the different flushing mechanisms between sediment associated and dissolved metals imply that different catchment management strategies should be implemented for the control of metal export however given that the metals in this catchment are transported mainly in the particulate fraction it seems most appropriate to focus on strategies aimed at this fraction accordingly management practices targeted on decreasing runoff and especially soil erosion in cultivated land could be effective in significantly reducing metal export and consequently the metal delivery to the reservoir located downstream thus improving water quality the results of this study have implications for catchment scale metal modelling approaches aimed at estimating metal yield and to infer changes in the behaviour of metals in the water environment under climate change scenarios given that extreme weather events seem likely to become more common in a warmer world it will be increasingly important to monitor metal dynamics during and after extreme episodes to seek to understand how metal behaviour in the water environment might respond to climate change which may facilitate decisions in ecosystem

1978 lushchik et al 1981 vyed 2000 no systematic stable isotope studies of precipitation have been performed so far the only data were obtained in 1977 1979 seletsky et al 1982 and comprise 34 oxygen isotope measurements from four rain gauges these data should be used with caution because the sampling was discontinuous with warm season precipitation being over represented 23 vs 9 measurements from the cold season the aims of this study were to 1 acquire a representative dataset characterizing the isotopic composition of precipitation in crimea and 2 to evaluate the controlling factors to accomplish the first task two precipitation sampling stations were installed on the northern slope of the crimean mountains and a 58 month long data series was obtained between 2009 and 2016 the location of the stations was chosen to characterize the two main physiographic and climatic regions of crimea which also play an important role in regional groundwater recharge to assist the evaluation of the controlling factors we undertook an assessment of the moisture sources of crimean precipitation using the lagrangian moisture source detection method 2 physiography and climate of crimea 2 1 physiography occupying an area of 27 000 km2 the crimean peninsula comprises two main physiographic provinces the crimean plains and the crimean mountains fig 1 the plains occupy two thirds of the peninsula in the north and their topography varies from fairly flat in the center to rolling plains and low hills on the tarkhankut and kerch peninsulas the crimean mountains comprise from north to south the outer the inner and the main ranges the outer and the inner ranges are also collectively known as the crimean piedmont predgorje they have the shape of a cuesta i e showing a gentle slope on the northwestern side and steep cliffs on the southeastern side the outer range gently rises from the crimean plains to a maximum elevation of 340 m to the southeast of the intermontane depression the more prominent inner range rises further reaching a maximum elevation of 560 m the main range has an asymmetrical structure with a much steeper slope on the south side and a series of plateaus known as yailas from turkic yaylagh for summer highland pasture the yailas are subdivided into a western and an eastern group separated by the angarsky pass the western yailas baydarskaya ay petrinskaya yaltinskaya nikitskaya gurzufskaya babugan and chatyr dag constitute the highest parts of the mountains with elevations ranging between 700 m and 1400 m the eastern yailas demerdzhi dolgorukovskaya and karabi are somewhat lower with maximum elevations mostly between 700 m and 1250 m the yailas represent karst plateaus built up of upper jurassic and cretaceous limestones resting on basement rocks and their surfaces feature rolling hills and karstic depressions 2 2 climate crimea can be subdivided into three broad regions characterized by different types of climate 1 the plains with an arid climate 2 the crimean mountains with a moderately warm and humid climate and 3 the south coast with a mediterranean type climate moderately warm with dry summers vyed 1999 based on relationships between temperature relative humidity and wind characteristics crimea can also be subdivided into six mesoclimatic regions logvinova and barabash 1982 i coastal ii near shore iii flat steppe iv hilly flats v southern piedmont and vi crimean mountains fig 1 the main factors controlling the climate of crimea are solar radiation atmospheric circulation topography and the surrounding seas being located between 44 and 46 n crimea experiences significant differences between summer and winter radiation which results in a broad range of seasonal temperatures atmospheric circulation over crimea is controlled by seasonal interactions between the polar jet stream and the siberian high cordova 2015 westerly winds drive mid latitude cyclones from the atlantic ocean across continental europe or across the mediterranean sea toward crimea according to vyed 2000 about 75 of the air masses arriving at crimea originate in the atlantic ocean some 10 are related to periodic invasions of cold fronts from northern latitudes warm and moist air from the mediterranean sea contributes additional 8 and the remaining 7 is represented by dry air originating in asia the atmospheric circulation patterns exhibit a pronounced seasonality winter circulation is controlled by the asian anticyclone cyclones arriving from south and southwest transport maritime subtropical air from the mediterranean sea early spring circulation is characterized by western cyclones which in late spring give way to southern and southwestern cyclones bringing warm air from the mediterranean and the black sea summer circulation is commonly affected by a large high pressure system above the southern ukraine the pressure gradient diminishes in summer leading to the development of local southwestern winds northern night sea breezes and sporadic northeast storms resulting from the interaction between the sea of azov and the heated land surface on the peninsula the autumn circulation is similar to the spring one but evolves into an opposite sequence local topography particularly the high mountain chain in the south of the peninsula affects the atmospheric circulation the interplay between global atmospheric circulation and the relief results in a highly heterogeneous distribution of precipitation over crimea the latter varies between 250 mm in the northern steppe parts of the peninsula and 1000 mm in the crimean mountains increasing by ca 60 mm per 100 m of altitude vyed 2000 fig 2 because most of the cyclones arriving at crimea move from west to east or from southwest to northeast the southwestern part of the peninsula receives most moisture the combined effect of global circulation and local topography results in higher precipitation in the mountains in the west than in the east a cursory summary of air circulation patterns presented above based on vyed 2000 indicates that the latter are highly variable and that air masses bringing moisture to crimea may follow very different paths air masses may travel for ca 3000 km across the european continent alternatively they may cross the large water bodies of the mediterranean black and azov seas this means that different moisture sources affected also by varying degrees by en route transformations rain out and recycling by evaporation and evapotranspiration are expected to contribute in a complex manner to the overall isotopic composition of precipitation on crimea 3 isotopic composition of meteoric precipitation in crimea 3 1 sampling and analysis meteoric precipitation was sampled in the city of simferopol nov 2009 mar 2016 and on the lower plateau of chatyr dag oct 2010 jun 2014 precipitation was sampled following gnip recommendations iaea gnip 2014 isotopic analysis of water samples was performed at innsbruck university details of sampling and analytical procedures can be found in supplement data on air temperature and precipitation amounts were obtained from the two wmo weather stations located at the simferopol airport and the angarsky pass table 1 the weather stations are located in close vicinity to and within the same mesoclimatic regions as the precipitation sampling sites fig 1 therefore meteorological parameters measured at these stations averaged on a monthly scale provide robust approximations of the parameters at our precipitation sampling sites 3 2 crimean local meteoric water line in his pioneering work craig 1961 demonstrated that globally the relationship between the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation can be described by a linear function referred to as the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 regional precipitation may deviate from this global relationship resulting in local meteoric water lines lmwl for example the lmwl for the mediterranean region is δ2h 8 δ18o 22 gat 1980 1982 i e this region is characterized by a significantly higher deuterium excess d excess reflecting intense evaporation of the mediterranean seawater lmwls for crimea were established for the first time based on the acquired time series 67 months for simferopol and 44 months for chatyr dag fig 3 both lines have very similar slopes and intercepts δ2h 7 3 δ18o 5 1 simferopol and δ2h 7 3 δ18o 4 8 chatyr dag the composite crimean lmwl is δ2h 7 3 δ18o 4 8 r 2 0 97 3 3 annual and seasonal isotopic effects in precipitation 3 3 1 annual effects amount weighted annual precipitation means were calculated for the years with no gaps in the record table 2 as expected precipitation at the chatyr dag station located some 700 m higher than the simferopol station is depleted in both isotope values 0 7 1 7 δ18o and 3 1 13 2 δ2h annual means vary from year to year by up to 1 δ18o and 10 δ2h 3 3 2 seasonal effects in crimea the period november march represents the cold season while april october corresponds to the warm season vyed 2000 the difference in isotopic composition of precipitation between the two seasons is highly variable from year to year table 3 the inter seasonal difference in the stable isotope composition seems to be inversely correlated with the difference between mean seasonal temperatures statistical significance of this correlation cannot be ascertained due to low number of observations the difference was the highest in 2012 when the cold season δ2h values were 39 and 55 more negative for simferopol and chatyr dag respectively than those of the warm season precipitation the mean cold season temperature for this year was 18 and 17 c lower than that of the warm season for simferopol and chatyr dag respectively in contrast there was only a very small difference and even an inversion at the chatyr dag station between cold and the warm season precipitation in 2013 the respective seasonal differences in temperature were 14 and 11 c respectively 3 4 lapse rate considering the difference in altitude between the sampling sites 690 m it is possible to assess the δ18o and δ2h lapse rate at the northern slope of the crimean mountains in 2011 2013 the lapse rate ranged between 0 10 and 0 25 100 m average 0 17 0 07 100 m 1σ for δ18o and between 0 46 and 1 92 100 m average 1 0 0 8 100 m for δ2h the δ18o lapse rate is just slightly smaller than the average for europe 0 21 100 m poage and chamberlain 2001 and the global average 0 2 100 m bowen and wilkinson 2002 an earlier study by seletsky et al 1982 reported δ18o lapse rates for the southern and the northern slopes of the main range of the crimean mountains of 0 26 100 m and 0 14 100 m respectively for the three stations used in that study at 300 660 and 1100 m a s l the isotopic data however did not cover the entire year and the accuracy of the reported lapse rates is therefore compromised 3 5 time series in this section we present a brief evaluation of the data more detailed statistical data analysis is presented in dublyansky et al 2018 in the subsequent text the significance of correlation is assessed by comparing the calculated values of the pearson s moment product correlation coefficients r with critical values corresponding to a certain significance level α to make the verbal description uniform strength of correlation is classified as very strong if r 0 8 strong if r 0 6 0 8 moderate if r 0 4 0 6 and weak and very weak if r 0 4 evans 1996 3 5 1 air temperature the monthly temperature pattern at simferopol and chatyr dag shows a strong seasonality with mean 2010 2014 temperatures of the three warmest months june august of 22 9 1 7 c simferopol and 19 0 1 8 c chatyr dag 1σ and those of the three coldest months december february of 1 5 2 9 c simferopol and 0 4 2 6 c chatyr dag the temperature range is 31 5 c simferopol and 27 0 c chatyr dag temperatures measured in simferopol and chatyr dag show a very strong correlation r 0 99 over the 58 month observation period correlation is also very strong on short time scales fig 4 on average the temperature on chatyr dag was 2 4 c lower than in simferopol the difference is larger for the warmest months 3 9 c and smaller for coldest ones 1 1 c 3 5 2 precipitation amount within the observation period 2010 2014 the precipitation amount recorded at both stations does not show any seasonality the weather station angarsky pass located in the crimean mountains mesoclimatic region fig 1 receives on an annual basis 41 56 more precipitation than simferopol the hilly flats mesoclimatic region although overall monthly precipitation amount at the two stations exhibits a significant and strong correlation r 0 68 this correlation varies on shorter time scales fig 4 for 2010 2012 the degree of correlation between the precipitation amount at the two stations was significant in summer and deteriorated to insignificant levels in autumn and winter in 2012 2013 this trend reversed and except for a very short period at the beginning of 2014 precipitation amounts at the two stations were very poorly correlated 3 5 3 isotopic composition of precipitation overall the time series of δ18o and δ2h shows a seasonal pattern with minima associated with cold periods and maxima with warm periods this seasonal pattern however is not stable for the observational period 45 month the isotopic composition of precipitation at the two precipitation sampling sites shows a strong and statistically significant correlation r 0 72 for δ18o and r 0 68 for δ2h on shorter time scales however this correlation is more variable often falling below significant levels for several months fig 5 3 5 4 deuterium excess deuterium excess d excess δ2h 8δ18o dansgaard 1964 varies between 0 5 and 20 4 and shows some seasonality tending to be larger during cold months december february 11 5 3 6 and 13 5 4 0 in simferopol and chatyr dag respectively and smaller in warm months june august 5 1 3 5 and 7 9 3 1 uncertainty is 1σ the long term 45 months average value of d excess is slightly smaller in simferopol than in chatyr dag 9 2 vs 11 1 respectively the parameter shows a strong statistically significant correlation between the sites r 0 70 as with other parameters this correlation is variable on shorter time scales it was strong and significant in 2011 and insignificant for most of 2012 and 2013 fig 6 4 lagrangian moisture source detection the origin of moisture on the crimean peninsula was evaluated using a lagrangian moisture diagnostics method implemented in the lagranto code wernli and davies 1997 further developed by sodemann et al 2008 to allow demarcation of evaporative moisture sources the model calculates backward trajectories of air parcels and weighs the moisture change evaporation or precipitation along the trajectories by their contribution to the local precipitation in the target area details of the method are described in the supplement modelling was based on the global atmospheric reanalysis era interim dataset spatial resolution 0 75 temporal resolution of 6 h of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts this moisture source detection technique allows identification of 51 of the moisture responsible for the precipitation in the target region the origin of moisture incorporated at the trajectory starting position 5 and derived from above the planetary boundary layer 44 remains indeterminate in our model trajectories start at the nodes of a 0 75 regular grid located between 44 25 and 45 75 n and 33 75 34 50 e at equally spaced levels δp 49 9 hpa from the surface to 500 h pa above ground level a starting grid thus defined 66 trajectories per time step the 15 day backward trajectories were calculated with 6 h time steps humidity content and relative humidity were monitored along the trajectories and areas of moisture uptake or loss precipitation were identified the subset of trajectories that resulted in precipitation over crimea was used for post processing the results of moisture tracking for the period 1979 2017 fig 7 allow for several observations to be made the overall shape of the moisture supplying region is elongated toward west attesting for some degree of long range westerly moisture transport a closer look however reveals that the intensity of moisture supply from areas immediately surrounding crimea is significantly higher than that of remote sources e g northern atlantic importantly moisture of the crimean precipitation is derived not only from sea surfaces but also from the surrounding land anatolia balkans southern ukraine and caucasus in order to quantify contribution from different sources the whole area from which the crimean moisture is derived was subdivided into eight source areas black sea sea of azov mediterranean sea caspian sea baltic sea northern atlantic ocean land the surrounding land surfaces where moisture supply is due to moisture recycling by evaporation and evapotranspiration and other sources sum of areas of moisture supply outside the listed areas the share of each source in the moisture supply to crimea was determined by integrating the evaporative contribution in mm months over the respective source areas calculations for 2010 2015 were made on a monthly basis in order to match the discretization of meteorological and stable isotope data overall four sources contribute about 92 of the detectable by the lagrangian tracking moisture to crimea the surrounding land 49 the mediterranean sea 15 black sea 14 and the atlantic ocean 14 contributions of each of the three remaining sources sea of azov caspian sea and baltic sea do not exceed 3 supply of moisture from the major sources exhibits a pronounced seasonality fig 8 during the warmest months of the year june august 71 12 of the moisture in crimean precipitation originate from the surrounding land as a result of evaporative and evapotranspirative moisture recycling contribution of the land source reaches a minimum but remains substantial ca 24 5 during winter december february in winter most of the moisture 55 10 is supplied by the combined input of atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea whereas during summer contribution of these sources drops to ca 5 or less the only major source that does not show a statistically significant seasonality is the black sea its pattern of moisture supply is noisy but the contribution tends to be somewhat smaller and more uniform during the first half of the year january june and greater and more variable during the second half july december 5 discussion controls on the isotopic composition of precipitation in crimea two parameters air temperature and precipitation amount are known to be most important controls of the isotopic composition of precipitation worldwide gat et al 2001 in particular variations in the local temperature or the closely related parameter of the precipitable water content sonntag et al 1983 are the dominant parameter yurtsever 1975 fricke and o neil 1999 at stations situated in mid continental settings the isotopic composition of precipitation typically follows the seasonal air temperature cycle gat et al 2001 in tropical regions on the other hand the isotopic composition scales negatively with the amount of precipitation dansgaard 1964 gat et al 2001 given crimea s setting as a peninsula adjacent to the black sea both seasonal temperature and precipitation amount should exert a control on the isotopic composition of precipitation on another hand we found that sources supplying the moisture in the crimean precipitation change seasonally between predominantly continental in summer to predominantly maritime mediterranean sea and atlantic in winter this change may also be at least partly responsible for the seasonal change of stable isotope properties in crimean precipitation 5 1 evaluation of variables two variables for which we will try to identify controls dependent variables are the δ18o and d excess it is noteworthy that there is statistically significant moderate correlation between them r 0 55 and 0 52 for simferopol and chatyr dag respectively i e about 27 30 of the variability of one parameter can be explained by the variability of the other to assess the possible controls of the meteorological parameters air temperature t and precipitation amount ppt and the moisture sources on the dependent variables we calculated pearson s coefficients of correlation for the 45 month long time series results are summarized in table 4 for the purpose of the regression analysis t ppt and contributions from different moisture sources will be treated as independent variables predictors it can be seen from table 4 that the correlation between t and ppt is very weak and statistically insignificant r 0 04 and 0 12 these two parameters can therefore be considered independent in contrast the time series of sources of moisture contributions are not entirely independent sources land and mediterranean sea atlantic exhibit a strong anti phase seasonal cyclicity fig 8 together they contribute 75 11 of the total moisture which results in very strong negative correlation between them r 0 88 table 5 similar albeit weaker effects are observed if the two sources mediterranean sea and atlantic are considered separately being mutually uncorrelated r 0 05 each shows a strong negative correlation with the land source r 0 67 and r 0 61 respectively the land and the mediterranean atlantic sources therefore are complementary only one of them will be used in analysis a strong correlation also exists between the land and the mediterranean atlantic sources and the temperature at simferopol and chatyr dag r 0 79 and 0 78 and r 0 84 and 0 85 respectively these variables also cannot be considered entirely independent both are related to seasonality which represents the complex nonlinear response of the physical climate system to annual solar forcing despite the fact that in case of air temperature this forcing operates more locally and directly solar radiant exposure in crimea ranges from 4 7 to 5 2 108 j m2 in june to 4 0 6 0 107 j m2 in december vyed 2000 while in case of the seasonally changing moisture sources it operates globally by affecting atmospheric circulation the effects seem to be linked the common forcing expresses itself as multicollinearity when constructing the multiple regression models out of the four major sources of humidity only the black sea is entirely independent of all other sources 5 2 oxygen isotopes the δ18o value of precipitation exhibits no statistically significant correlation with precipitation amount r 0 14 and 0 16 in contrast the correlation with air temperature is significant r 0 50 and 0 63 indicating that between 25 and 39 of the δ18o variability can be explained by variations in t interestingly the correlation for simferopol is substantially worse than for chatyr dag as was discussed above the temperature and variables describing the moisture sources land and mediterranean atlantic exhibit multicollinearity the two remaining independent variables precipitation amount and the black sea source exert a statistically insignificant control on δ18o of crimean precipitation therefore the multiple regression equations can be reduced to linear regressions δ18o 0 16 t 9 07 for simferopol and δ18o 0 25 t 10 49 for chatyr dag these empirical equations differ substantially from the relation for north atlantic and european gnip stations reported by yurtsever 1975 δ18o 0 521 0 014 t 14 96 0 21 5 3 deuterium excess deuterium excess is sensitive to moisture source conditions specifically the relative humidity at the ocean surface during evaporation merlivat and jouzel 1979 johnsen et al 1989 pfahl and wernli 2008 pfahl and sodemann 2014 and therefore is suitable for assessing the origin of water vapour high d excess values reflect fast evaporation low rh and stronger kinetic isotope effects during evaporation low d excess reflects slow evaporation in conditions of high rh clark and fritz 1997 for example european precipitation originating in the mediterranean sea has higher values of d excess 22 gat and carmi 1970 while precipitation of atlantic provenance has lower d excess 10 craig 1961 the d excess of precipitation can also reflect processes of terrestrial moisture recycling evaporation from the ground bare soil surface water bodies leads to the increase in d excess salati et al 1979 gat and matsui 1991 while evapotranspiration and condensation have no effect gat 2005 it is becoming increasingly apparent however that the concept delineated above might be too simplistic for example rank and papesch 2005 froehlich et al 2008 and hager and foelsche 2015 reported that the seasonal pattern of d excess in austria is different for stations located in valleys and on the mountains even if the horizontal distance between them is only a few kilometers these authors also found no significant difference in d excess at stations located on the northern and the southern side of the alps i e affected by different moisture sources they suggested that these aberrations reflect secondary fractionation processes which occur when moist air masses ascend slopes of mountains so that the altitude effect and the effect of sub cloud evaporation mask and distort the initial isotopic moisture source signal over the entire period of observation in crimea 45 months d excess shows a statistically significant moderately negative correlation with the contribution from the land moisture source r 0 55 and r 0 53 for simferopol and chatyr dag respectively attempts of correlating the measured d excess with the precipitation source land at shorter time scales was unsuccessful fig 9 a statistically significant correlation is present in 13 and 25 of the time simferopol and chatyr dag respectively at α 0 05 the pattern is not stable on a year to year basis correlations are higher for warm months of 2011 and 2012 when the contribution of the land source was highest in 2013 however the highest contributions from land showed statistically insignificant correlation with d excess the absolute values of d excess of the land source are variable ranging between 0 6 and 19 1 for warm months when the contribution from this source is highest mean d excess values range between 7 0 and 7 6 4 6 for simferopol and 7 8 and 8 7 3 6 for chatyr dag 1σ these values represent the best approximation of the d excess fingerprint of the land moisture source evaluating the fingerprint for other major moisture sources is not possible because the share of individual sources in crimean precipitation is almost always less than 50 on average d excess is ca 1 8 greater in chatyr dag compared to simferopol 45 months of observations considering the difference in altitude between the two stations the altitude effect for d excess is 0 26 100 m which is smaller than the value 0 43 100 m reported by rank and papesch 2005 for the alps one parameter that can be used to quantify the setting of a precipitation site is the ratio of the spread in d excess values relative to the range in δ18o gat et al 2001 over the european continent this value varies from 1 8 to 2 8 at coastal stations such as reykjavik valentia in ireland and faro in portugal to 0 35 0 7 at continental stations e g berlin krakow and vienna for simferopol and chatyr dag this parameter is 1 3 and 1 4 respectively placing the study area s setting in between the typical coastal and the typical continental ones data in table 4 show that the contribution of moisture from the land source is the independent variable which shows the highest correlation with d excess similarly to δ18o potential predictor variables t and mediterranean atlantic source can be discarded because of the multicollinearity issue whereas the remaining variables amount of precipitation and the moisture contribution from the black sea were found to exert statistically insignificant controls on d excess the regression equations are d excess 0 11 land 14 45 for simferopol and d excess 0 11 land 16 12 for chatyr dag coefficients of determination r 2 0 30 and0 29 indicate that only 30 and 29 of variability in d excess are explained by variations in the moisture contribution from the land source at simferopol and chatyr dag respectively 5 4 nao index the north atlantic oscillation nao is known to profoundly influence the isotopic composition of precipitation via its control on air temperature and the trajectories of the westerly winds that carry moisture onto europe during winter comas bru et al 2016 in central europe winter october through march precipitation δ2h and δ18o values are known to correlate with the winter nao index hurrell 1995 deininger et al 2016 the nao indices jones et al 1997 were compared with the stable isotope time series for the period of observation 45 month the isotopic composition of precipitation δ18o at the two sampling sites show a very weak correlation only r 0 19 for simferopol and r 0 42 for chatyr dag only 3 17 of variations in δ18o of precipitation can therefore be attributed to the strength of the nao the correlation does not improve substantially if only the winter months october march are included r 0 08 for simferopol and r 0 45 for chatyr dag these low numbers are not surprising given our finding that the atlantic source contribution in october march does not exceed on average 20 section 4 5 5 local and far field controls on the isotopic composition of precipitation in crimea for the entire period of observation 45 months out of the two local factors temperature and precipitation amount only the former shows a statistically significant correlation with the isotopic composition of precipitation the correlation between t and δ18o is moderate r 0 50 for simferopol and strong r 0 63 for chatyr dag precipitation indicating that some 25 of variability in δ18o in simferopol and 39 on chatyr dag can be explained by the temperature regime at these sites on shorter time scales 6 months running correlation the picture is more nuanced fig 10 the parameters remain strongly correlated for periods of several months but then the correlation breaks down several observations can be made the correlation between t and isotopic composition of precipitation is more pronounced in the mountain site chatyr dag and stronger during cold months the correlation time series for the two sites exhibit mutually consistent temporal patterns for some periods of the time e g 2012 2013 but dissimilar ones for others e g 2011 these observations suggest that the isotopic composition of precipitation in crimea is affected by factors other than temperature and that the influence of these other factors varies not only in time but also spatially i e affecting the two sites to a different extent the considered far field factors comprise evaporative sources of moisture reconstructed by means of lagrangian moisture tracking contributions of the main sources of moisture also show a significant correlation with the isotopic composition of precipitation this correlation however may reflect the fact that contributions from different precipitation sources exhibit a strong seasonality the roles of seasonally changing air temperature and possibly seasonally varying isotopic composition of the moisture derived from different sources cannot be disentangled however another far field parameter known to exert a strong control on the isotopic composition of precipitation in europe the nao index shows no statistically significant correlation with crimean precipitation 5 6 isotopic composition of cold and warm season precipitation one of the findings of this study which is relevant for isotope hydrogeology research in the area is that for a number of years three out of four for simferopol and two out of three at chatyr dag there is little or no difference between the isotopic composition of precipitation in cold and warm seasons section 3 3 2 this observation is partly in conflict with the concept that the low isotope values of some karst springs in crimea reflect predominant winter recharge seletsky et al 1982 dublyansky et al 2012 we note that the distinction between cold and warm seasons accepted by meteorologists may not be entirely suitable when discussing the conditions of recharge on the karst plateaus of the crimean mountains 6 conclusions systematic sampling of precipitation was carried out over a period of 58 months at two stations in crimea located in the crimean piedmont simferopol 290 m a s l and on the northern slope of the main range of the crimean mountains chatyr dag 980 m a s l oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation at both stations plot along tightly constrained lines with very similar slopes and intercepts the local crimean meteoric water line was constructed from the combined data set δ2h 7 3 δ18o 4 8 r 2 0 97 precipitation at the simferopol and the chatyr dag stations is not consistently controlled by the local air temperature nor the precipitation amount remote controls such as moisture sources and the nao do not exert a major control on the isotopic composition of precipitation in crimea either to summarize the isotopic composition of precipitation in crimea seems to be controlled by a combination of local and far field factors contributions of these parameters vary on different time scales as well as spatially no simple controlling relationship was identified in the currently available dataset

6989,a first systematic study of the isotopic composition of precipitation on the crimean peninsula was carried over the period of 58 months at two stations located on the crimean piedmont simferopol

et al 2009 yamanaka et al 2007 to oceanic islands in the monsoon climate okinawa uemura et al 2012 this emerging body of local time series shows that the commonly presumed primary controlling factors temperature and precipitation amount play a role at some sites but other factors such as moisture recycling transient eddies and changing moisture sources exert the dominant control the crimean peninsula is surrounded by vast expanses of water the black sea and the sea of azov and has an extensive land mass in the north the closest gnip stations odessa ukraine rostov na donu russia sinop and rize turkey are located 300 700 km away and are separated from crimea by the sea although the meteorology and hydrogeology of the peninsula are reasonably well understood barabanov et al 1970 pershin 1978 lushchik et al 1981 vyed 2000 no systematic stable isotope studies of precipitation have been performed so far the only data were obtained in 1977 1979 seletsky et al 1982 and comprise 34 oxygen isotope measurements from four rain gauges these data should be used with caution because the sampling was discontinuous with warm season precipitation being over represented 23 vs 9 measurements from the cold season the aims of this study were to 1 acquire a representative dataset characterizing the isotopic composition of precipitation in crimea and 2 to evaluate the controlling factors to accomplish the first task two precipitation sampling stations were installed on the northern slope of the crimean mountains and a 58 month long data series was obtained between 2009 and 2016 the location of the stations was chosen to characterize the two main physiographic and climatic regions of crimea which also play an important role in regional groundwater recharge to assist the evaluation of the controlling factors we undertook an assessment of the moisture sources of crimean precipitation using the lagrangian moisture source detection method 2 physiography and climate of crimea 2 1 physiography occupying an area of 27 000 km2 the crimean peninsula comprises two main physiographic provinces the crimean plains and the crimean mountains fig 1 the plains occupy two thirds of the peninsula in the north and their topography varies from fairly flat in the center to rolling plains and low hills on the tarkhankut and kerch peninsulas the crimean mountains comprise from north to south the outer the inner and the main ranges the outer and the inner ranges are also collectively known as the crimean piedmont predgorje they have the shape of a cuesta i e showing a gentle slope on the northwestern side and steep cliffs on the southeastern side the outer range gently rises from the crimean plains to a maximum elevation of 340 m to the southeast of the intermontane depression the more prominent inner range rises further reaching a maximum elevation of 560 m the main range has an asymmetrical structure with a much steeper slope on the south side and a series of plateaus known as yailas from turkic yaylagh for summer highland pasture the yailas are subdivided into a western and an eastern group separated by the angarsky pass the western yailas baydarskaya ay petrinskaya yaltinskaya nikitskaya gurzufskaya babugan and chatyr dag constitute the highest parts of the mountains with elevations ranging between 700 m and 1400 m the eastern yailas demerdzhi dolgorukovskaya and karabi are somewhat lower with maximum elevations mostly between 700 m and 1250 m the yailas represent karst plateaus built up of upper jurassic and cretaceous limestones resting on basement rocks and their surfaces feature rolling hills and karstic depressions 2 2 climate crimea can be subdivided into three broad regions characterized by different types of climate 1 the plains with an arid climate 2 the crimean mountains with a moderately warm and humid climate and 3 the south coast with a mediterranean type climate moderately warm with dry summers vyed 1999 based on relationships between temperature relative humidity and wind characteristics crimea can also be subdivided into six mesoclimatic regions logvinova and barabash 1982 i coastal ii near shore iii flat steppe iv hilly flats v southern piedmont and vi crimean mountains fig 1 the main factors controlling the climate of crimea are solar radiation atmospheric circulation topography and the surrounding seas being located between 44 and 46 n crimea experiences significant differences between summer and winter radiation which results in a broad range of seasonal temperatures atmospheric circulation over crimea is controlled by seasonal interactions between the polar jet stream and the siberian high cordova 2015 westerly winds drive mid latitude cyclones from the atlantic ocean across continental europe or across the mediterranean sea toward crimea according to vyed 2000 about 75 of the air masses arriving at crimea originate in the atlantic ocean some 10 are related to periodic invasions of cold fronts from northern latitudes warm and moist air from the mediterranean sea contributes additional 8 and the remaining 7 is represented by dry air originating in asia the atmospheric circulation patterns exhibit a pronounced seasonality winter circulation is controlled by the asian anticyclone cyclones arriving from south and southwest transport maritime subtropical air from the mediterranean sea early spring circulation is characterized by western cyclones which in late spring give way to southern and southwestern cyclones bringing warm air from the mediterranean and the black sea summer circulation is commonly affected by a large high pressure system above the southern ukraine the pressure gradient diminishes in summer leading to the development of local southwestern winds northern night sea breezes and sporadic northeast storms resulting from the interaction between the sea of azov and the heated land surface on the peninsula the autumn circulation is similar to the spring one but evolves into an opposite sequence local topography particularly the high mountain chain in the south of the peninsula affects the atmospheric circulation the interplay between global atmospheric circulation and the relief results in a highly heterogeneous distribution of precipitation over crimea the latter varies between 250 mm in the northern steppe parts of the peninsula and 1000 mm in the crimean mountains increasing by ca 60 mm per 100 m of altitude vyed 2000 fig 2 because most of the cyclones arriving at crimea move from west to east or from southwest to northeast the southwestern part of the peninsula receives most moisture the combined effect of global circulation and local topography results in higher precipitation in the mountains in the west than in the east a cursory summary of air circulation patterns presented above based on vyed 2000 indicates that the latter are highly variable and that air masses bringing moisture to crimea may follow very different paths air masses may travel for ca 3000 km across the european continent alternatively they may cross the large water bodies of the mediterranean black and azov seas this means that different moisture sources affected also by varying degrees by en route transformations rain out and recycling by evaporation and evapotranspiration are expected to contribute in a complex manner to the overall isotopic composition of precipitation on crimea 3 isotopic composition of meteoric precipitation in crimea 3 1 sampling and analysis meteoric precipitation was sampled in the city of simferopol nov 2009 mar 2016 and on the lower plateau of chatyr dag oct 2010 jun 2014 precipitation was sampled following gnip recommendations iaea gnip 2014 isotopic analysis of water samples was performed at innsbruck university details of sampling and analytical procedures can be found in supplement data on air temperature and precipitation amounts were obtained from the two wmo weather stations located at the simferopol airport and the angarsky pass table 1 the weather stations are located in close vicinity to and within the same mesoclimatic regions as the precipitation sampling sites fig 1 therefore meteorological parameters measured at these stations averaged on a monthly scale provide robust approximations of the parameters at our precipitation sampling sites 3 2 crimean local meteoric water line in his pioneering work craig 1961 demonstrated that globally the relationship between the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation can be described by a linear function referred to as the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 regional precipitation may deviate from this global relationship resulting in local meteoric water lines lmwl for example the lmwl for the mediterranean region is δ2h 8 δ18o 22 gat 1980 1982 i e this region is characterized by a significantly higher deuterium excess d excess reflecting intense evaporation of the mediterranean seawater lmwls for crimea were established for the first time based on the acquired time series 67 months for simferopol and 44 months for chatyr dag fig 3 both lines have very similar slopes and intercepts δ2h 7 3 δ18o 5 1 simferopol and δ2h 7 3 δ18o 4 8 chatyr dag the composite crimean lmwl is δ2h 7 3 δ18o 4 8 r 2 0 97 3 3 annual and seasonal isotopic effects in precipitation 3 3 1 annual effects amount weighted annual precipitation means were calculated for the years with no gaps in the record table 2 as expected precipitation at the chatyr dag station located some 700 m higher than the simferopol station is depleted in both isotope values 0 7 1 7 δ18o and 3 1 13 2 δ2h annual means vary from year to year by up to 1 δ18o and 10 δ2h 3 3 2 seasonal effects in crimea the period november march represents the cold season while april october corresponds to the warm season vyed 2000 the difference in isotopic composition of precipitation between the two seasons is highly variable from year to year table 3 the inter seasonal difference in the stable isotope composition seems to be inversely correlated with the difference between mean seasonal temperatures statistical significance of this correlation cannot be ascertained due to low number of observations the difference was the highest in 2012 when the cold season δ2h values were 39 and 55 more negative for simferopol and chatyr dag respectively than those of the warm season precipitation the mean cold season temperature for this year was 18 and 17 c lower than that of the warm season for simferopol and chatyr dag respectively in contrast there was only a very small difference and even an inversion at the chatyr dag station between cold and the warm season precipitation in 2013 the respective seasonal differences in temperature were 14 and 11 c respectively 3 4 lapse rate considering the difference in altitude between the sampling sites 690 m it is possible to assess the δ18o and δ2h lapse rate at the northern slope of the crimean mountains in 2011 2013 the lapse rate ranged between 0 10 and 0 25 100 m average 0 17 0 07 100 m 1σ for δ18o and between 0 46 and 1 92 100 m average 1 0 0 8 100 m for δ2h the δ18o lapse rate is just slightly smaller than the average for europe 0 21 100 m poage and chamberlain 2001 and the global average 0 2 100 m bowen and wilkinson 2002 an earlier study by seletsky et al 1982 reported δ18o lapse rates for the southern and the northern slopes of the main range of the crimean mountains of 0 26 100 m and 0 14 100 m respectively for the three stations used in that study at 300 660 and 1100 m a s l the isotopic data however did not cover the entire year and the accuracy of the reported lapse rates is therefore compromised 3 5 time series in this section we present a brief evaluation of the data more detailed statistical data analysis is presented in dublyansky et al 2018 in the subsequent text the significance of correlation is assessed by comparing the calculated values of the pearson s moment product correlation coefficients r with critical values corresponding to a certain significance level α to make the verbal description uniform strength of correlation is classified as very strong if r 0 8 strong if r 0 6 0 8 moderate if r 0 4 0 6 and weak and very weak if r 0 4 evans 1996 3 5 1 air temperature the monthly temperature pattern at simferopol and chatyr dag shows a strong seasonality with mean 2010 2014 temperatures of the three warmest months june august of 22 9 1 7 c simferopol and 19 0 1 8 c chatyr dag 1σ and those of the three coldest months december february of 1 5 2 9 c simferopol and 0 4 2 6 c chatyr dag the temperature range is 31 5 c simferopol and 27 0 c chatyr dag temperatures measured in simferopol and chatyr dag show a very strong correlation r 0 99 over the 58 month observation period correlation is also very strong on short time scales fig 4 on average the temperature on chatyr dag was 2 4 c lower than in simferopol the difference is larger for the warmest months 3 9 c and smaller for coldest ones 1 1 c 3 5 2 precipitation amount within the observation period 2010 2014 the precipitation amount recorded at both stations does not show any seasonality the weather station angarsky pass located in the crimean mountains mesoclimatic region fig 1 receives on an annual basis 41 56 more precipitation than simferopol the hilly flats mesoclimatic region although overall monthly precipitation amount at the two stations exhibits a significant and strong correlation r 0 68 this correlation varies on shorter time scales fig 4 for 2010 2012 the degree of correlation between the precipitation amount at the two stations was significant in summer and deteriorated to insignificant levels in autumn and winter in 2012 2013 this trend reversed and except for a very short period at the beginning of 2014 precipitation amounts at the two stations were very poorly correlated 3 5 3 isotopic composition of precipitation overall the time series of δ18o and δ2h shows a seasonal pattern with minima associated with cold periods and maxima with warm periods this seasonal pattern however is not stable for the observational period 45 month the isotopic composition of precipitation at the two precipitation sampling sites shows a strong and statistically significant correlation r 0 72 for δ18o and r 0 68 for δ2h on shorter time scales however this correlation is more variable often falling below significant levels for several months fig 5 3 5 4 deuterium excess deuterium excess d excess δ2h 8δ18o dansgaard 1964 varies between 0 5 and 20 4 and shows some seasonality tending to be larger during cold months december february 11 5 3 6 and 13 5 4 0 in simferopol and chatyr dag respectively and smaller in warm months june august 5 1 3 5 and 7 9 3 1 uncertainty is 1σ the long term 45 months average value of d excess is slightly smaller in simferopol than in chatyr dag 9 2 vs 11 1 respectively the parameter shows a strong statistically significant correlation between the sites r 0 70 as with other parameters this correlation is variable on shorter time scales it was strong and significant in 2011 and insignificant for most of 2012 and 2013 fig 6 4 lagrangian moisture source detection the origin of moisture on the crimean peninsula was evaluated using a lagrangian moisture diagnostics method implemented in the lagranto code wernli and davies 1997 further developed by sodemann et al 2008 to allow demarcation of evaporative moisture sources the model calculates backward trajectories of air parcels and weighs the moisture change evaporation or precipitation along the trajectories by their contribution to the local precipitation in the target area details of the method are described in the supplement modelling was based on the global atmospheric reanalysis era interim dataset spatial resolution 0 75 temporal resolution of 6 h of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts this moisture source detection technique allows identification of 51 of the moisture responsible for the precipitation in the target region the origin of moisture incorporated at the trajectory starting position 5 and derived from above the planetary boundary layer 44 remains indeterminate in our model trajectories start at the nodes of a 0 75 regular grid located between 44 25 and 45 75 n and 33 75 34 50 e at equally spaced levels δp 49 9 hpa from the surface to 500 h pa above ground level a starting grid thus defined 66 trajectories per time step the 15 day backward trajectories were calculated with 6 h time steps humidity content and relative humidity were monitored along the trajectories and areas of moisture uptake or loss precipitation were identified the subset of trajectories that resulted in precipitation over crimea was used for post processing the results of moisture tracking for the period 1979 2017 fig 7 allow for several observations to be made the overall shape of the moisture supplying region is elongated toward west attesting for some degree of long range westerly moisture transport a closer look however reveals that the intensity of moisture supply from areas immediately surrounding crimea is significantly higher than that of remote sources e g northern atlantic importantly moisture of the crimean precipitation is derived not only from sea surfaces but also from the surrounding land anatolia balkans southern ukraine and caucasus in order to quantify contribution from different sources the whole area from which the crimean moisture is derived was subdivided into eight source areas black sea sea of azov mediterranean sea caspian sea baltic sea northern atlantic ocean land the surrounding land surfaces where moisture supply is due to moisture recycling by evaporation and evapotranspiration and other sources sum of areas of moisture supply outside the listed areas the share of each source in the moisture supply to crimea was determined by integrating the evaporative contribution in mm months over the respective source areas calculations for 2010 2015 were made on a monthly basis in order to match the discretization of meteorological and stable isotope data overall four sources contribute about 92 of the detectable by the lagrangian tracking moisture to crimea the surrounding land 49 the mediterranean sea 15 black sea 14 and the atlantic ocean 14 contributions of each of the three remaining sources sea of azov caspian sea and baltic sea do not exceed 3 supply of moisture from the major sources exhibits a pronounced seasonality fig 8 during the warmest months of the year june august 71 12 of the moisture in crimean precipitation originate from the surrounding land as a result of evaporative and evapotranspirative moisture recycling contribution of the land source reaches a minimum but remains substantial ca 24 5 during winter december february in winter most of the moisture 55 10 is supplied by the combined input of atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea whereas during summer contribution of these sources drops to ca 5 or less the only major source that does not show a statistically significant seasonality is the black sea its pattern of moisture supply is noisy but the contribution tends to be somewhat smaller and more uniform during the first half of the year january june and greater and more variable during the second half july december 5 discussion controls on the isotopic composition of precipitation in crimea two parameters air temperature and precipitation amount are known to be most important controls of the isotopic composition of precipitation worldwide gat et al 2001 in particular variations in the local temperature or the closely related parameter of the precipitable water content sonntag et al 1983 are the dominant parameter yurtsever 1975 fricke and o neil 1999 at stations situated in mid continental settings the isotopic composition of precipitation typically follows the seasonal air temperature cycle gat et al 2001 in tropical regions on the other hand the isotopic composition scales negatively with the amount of precipitation dansgaard 1964 gat et al 2001 given crimea s setting as a peninsula adjacent to the black sea both seasonal temperature and precipitation amount should exert a control on the isotopic composition of precipitation on another hand we found that sources supplying the moisture in the crimean precipitation change seasonally between predominantly continental in summer to predominantly maritime mediterranean sea and atlantic in winter this change may also be at least partly responsible for the seasonal change of stable isotope properties in crimean precipitation 5 1 evaluation of variables two variables for which we will try to identify controls dependent variables are the δ18o and d excess it is noteworthy that there is statistically significant moderate correlation between them r 0 55 and 0 52 for simferopol and chatyr dag respectively i e about 27 30 of the variability of one parameter can be explained by the variability of the other to assess the possible controls of the meteorological parameters air temperature t and precipitation amount ppt and the moisture sources on the dependent variables we calculated pearson s coefficients of correlation for the 45 month long time series results are summarized in table 4 for the purpose of the regression analysis t ppt and contributions from different moisture sources will be treated as independent variables predictors it can be seen from table 4 that the correlation between t and ppt is very weak and statistically insignificant r 0 04 and 0 12 these two parameters can therefore be considered independent in contrast the time series of sources of moisture contributions are not entirely independent sources land and mediterranean sea atlantic exhibit a strong anti phase seasonal cyclicity fig 8 together they contribute 75 11 of the total moisture which results in very strong negative correlation between them r 0 88 table 5 similar albeit weaker effects are observed if the two sources mediterranean sea and atlantic are considered separately being mutually uncorrelated r 0 05 each shows a strong negative correlation with the land source r 0 67 and r 0 61 respectively the land and the mediterranean atlantic sources therefore are complementary only one of them will be used in analysis a strong correlation also exists between the land and the mediterranean atlantic sources and the temperature at simferopol and chatyr dag r 0 79 and 0 78 and r 0 84 and 0 85 respectively these variables also cannot be considered entirely independent both are related to seasonality which represents the complex nonlinear response of the physical climate system to annual solar forcing despite the fact that in case of air temperature this forcing operates more locally and directly solar radiant exposure in crimea ranges from 4 7 to 5 2 108 j m2 in june to 4 0 6 0 107 j m2 in december vyed 2000 while in case of the seasonally changing moisture sources it operates globally by affecting atmospheric circulation the effects seem to be linked the common forcing expresses itself as multicollinearity when constructing the multiple regression models out of the four major sources of humidity only the black sea is entirely independent of all other sources 5 2 oxygen isotopes the δ18o value of precipitation exhibits no statistically significant correlation with precipitation amount r 0 14 and 0 16 in contrast the correlation with air temperature is significant r 0 50 and 0 63 indicating that between 25 and 39 of the δ18o variability can be explained by variations in t interestingly the correlation for simferopol is substantially worse than for chatyr dag as was discussed above the temperature and variables describing the moisture sources land and mediterranean atlantic exhibit multicollinearity the two remaining independent variables precipitation amount and the black sea source exert a statistically insignificant control on δ18o of crimean precipitation therefore the multiple regression equations can be reduced to linear regressions δ18o 0 16 t 9 07 for simferopol and δ18o 0 25 t 10 49 for chatyr dag these empirical equations differ substantially from the relation for north atlantic and european gnip stations reported by yurtsever 1975 δ18o 0 521 0 014 t 14 96 0 21 5 3 deuterium excess deuterium excess is sensitive to moisture source conditions specifically the relative humidity at the ocean surface during evaporation merlivat and jouzel 1979 johnsen et al 1989 pfahl and wernli 2008 pfahl and sodemann 2014 and therefore is suitable for assessing the origin of water vapour high d excess values reflect fast evaporation low rh and stronger kinetic isotope effects during evaporation low d excess reflects slow evaporation in conditions of high rh clark and fritz 1997 for example european precipitation originating in the mediterranean sea has higher values of d excess 22 gat and carmi 1970 while precipitation of atlantic provenance has lower d excess 10 craig 1961 the d excess of precipitation can also reflect processes of terrestrial moisture recycling evaporation from the ground bare soil surface water bodies leads to the increase in d excess salati et al 1979 gat and matsui 1991 while evapotranspiration and condensation have no effect gat 2005 it is becoming increasingly apparent however that the concept delineated above might be too simplistic for example rank and papesch 2005 froehlich et al 2008 and hager and foelsche 2015 reported that the seasonal pattern of d excess in austria is different for stations located in valleys and on the mountains even if the horizontal distance between them is only a few kilometers these authors also found no significant difference in d excess at stations located on the northern and the southern side of the alps i e affected by different moisture sources they suggested that these aberrations reflect secondary fractionation processes which occur when moist air masses ascend slopes of mountains so that the altitude effect and the effect of sub cloud evaporation mask and distort the initial isotopic moisture source signal over the entire period of observation in crimea 45 months d excess shows a statistically significant moderately negative correlation with the contribution from the land moisture source r 0 55 and r 0 53 for simferopol and chatyr dag respectively attempts of correlating the measured d excess with the precipitation source land at shorter time scales was unsuccessful fig 9 a statistically significant correlation is present in 13 and 25 of the time simferopol and chatyr dag respectively at α 0 05 the pattern is not stable on a year to year basis correlations are higher for warm months of 2011 and 2012 when the contribution of the land source was highest in 2013 however the highest contributions from land showed statistically insignificant correlation with d excess the absolute values of d excess of the land source are variable ranging between 0 6 and 19 1 for warm months when the contribution from this source is highest mean d excess values range between 7 0 and 7 6 4 6 for simferopol and 7 8 and 8 7 3 6 for chatyr dag 1σ these values represent the best approximation of the d excess fingerprint of the land moisture source evaluating the fingerprint for other major moisture sources is not possible because the share of individual sources in crimean precipitation is almost always less than 50 on average d excess is ca 1 8 greater in chatyr dag compared to simferopol 45 months of observations considering the difference in altitude between the two stations the altitude effect for d excess is 0 26 100 m which is smaller than the value 0 43 100 m reported by rank and papesch 2005 for the alps one parameter that can be used to quantify the setting of a precipitation site is the ratio of the spread in d excess values relative to the range in δ18o gat et al 2001 over the european continent this value varies from 1 8 to 2 8 at coastal stations such as reykjavik valentia in ireland and faro in portugal to 0 35 0 7 at continental stations e g berlin krakow and vienna for simferopol and chatyr dag this parameter is 1 3 and 1 4 respectively placing the study area s setting in between the typical coastal and the typical continental ones data in table 4 show that the contribution of moisture from the land source is the independent variable which shows the highest correlation with d excess similarly to δ18o potential predictor variables t and mediterranean atlantic source can be discarded because of the multicollinearity issue whereas the remaining variables amount of precipitation and the moisture contribution from the black sea were found to exert statistically insignificant controls on d excess the regression equations are d excess 0 11 land 14 45 for simferopol and d excess 0 11 land 16 12 for chatyr dag coefficients of determination r 2 0 30 and0 29 indicate that only 30 and 29 of variability in d excess are explained by variations in the moisture contribution from the land source at simferopol and chatyr dag respectively 5 4 nao index the north atlantic oscillation nao is known to profoundly influence the isotopic composition of precipitation via its control on air temperature and the trajectories of the westerly winds that carry moisture onto europe during winter comas bru et al 2016 in central europe winter october through march precipitation δ2h and δ18o values are known to correlate with the winter nao index hurrell 1995 deininger et al 2016 the nao indices jones et al 1997 were compared with the stable isotope time series for the period of observation 45 month the isotopic composition of precipitation δ18o at the two sampling sites show a very weak correlation only r 0 19 for simferopol and r 0 42 for chatyr dag only 3 17 of variations in δ18o of precipitation can therefore be attributed to the strength of the nao the correlation does not improve substantially if only the winter months october march are included r 0 08 for simferopol and r 0 45 for chatyr dag these low numbers are not surprising given our finding that the atlantic source contribution in october march does not exceed on average 20 section 4 5 5 local and far field controls on the isotopic composition of precipitation in crimea for the entire period of observation 45 months out of the two local factors temperature and precipitation amount only the former shows a statistically significant correlation with the isotopic composition of precipitation the correlation between t and δ18o is moderate r 0 50 for simferopol and strong r 0 63 for chatyr dag precipitation indicating that some 25 of variability in δ18o in simferopol and 39 on chatyr dag can be explained by the temperature regime at these sites on shorter time scales 6 months running correlation the picture is more nuanced fig 10 the parameters remain strongly correlated for periods of several months but then the correlation breaks down several observations can be made the correlation between t and isotopic composition of precipitation is more pronounced in the mountain site chatyr dag and stronger during cold months the correlation time series for the two sites exhibit mutually consistent temporal patterns for some periods of the time e g 2012 2013 but dissimilar ones for others e g 2011 these observations suggest that the isotopic composition of precipitation in crimea is affected by factors other than temperature and that the influence of these other factors varies not only in time but also spatially i e affecting the two sites to a different extent the considered far field factors comprise evaporative sources of moisture reconstructed by means of lagrangian moisture tracking contributions of the main sources of moisture also show a significant correlation with the isotopic composition of precipitation this correlation however may reflect the fact that contributions from different precipitation sources exhibit a strong seasonality the roles of seasonally changing air temperature and possibly seasonally varying isotopic composition of the moisture derived from different sources cannot be disentangled however another far field parameter known to exert a strong control on the isotopic composition of precipitation in europe the nao index shows no statistically significant correlation with crimean precipitation 5 6 isotopic composition of cold and warm season precipitation one of the findings of this study which is relevant for isotope hydrogeology research in the area is that for a number of years three out of four for simferopol and two out of three at chatyr dag there is little or no difference between the isotopic composition of precipitation in cold and warm seasons section 3 3 2 this observation is partly in conflict with the concept that the low isotope values of some karst springs in crimea reflect predominant winter recharge seletsky et al 1982 dublyansky et al 2012 we note that the distinction between cold and warm seasons accepted by meteorologists may not be entirely suitable when discussing the conditions of recharge on the karst plateaus of the crimean mountains 6 conclusions systematic sampling of precipitation was carried out over a period of 58 months at two stations in crimea located in the crimean piedmont simferopol 290 m a s l and on the northern slope of the main range of the crimean mountains chatyr dag 980 m a s l oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation at both stations plot along tightly constrained lines with very similar slopes and intercepts the local crimean meteoric water line was constructed from the combined data set δ2h 7 3 δ18o 4 8 r 2 0 97 precipitation at the simferopol and the chatyr dag stations is not consistently controlled by the local air temperature nor the precipitation amount remote controls such as moisture sources and the nao do not exert a major control on the isotopic composition of precipitation in crimea either to summarize the isotopic composition of precipitation in crimea seems to be controlled by a combination of local and far field factors contributions of these parameters vary on different time scales as well as spatially no simple controlling relationship was identified in the currently available dataset
