13520,environmental pollution is increasing day by day due to anthropogenic activities and different types of toxic contaminants such as heavy metals chemicals dyes pesticides etc enter the environment from different sources such as municipal industries and agricultural among wastewater treatment techniques bioremediation is one of promising techniques which utilize the inherent biological mechanism of plant and microorganism for the remediation of diverse pollutants microalgae have been applied to mitigate the toxic and recalcitrant pollutants in the effluents microalgae have the capacity to remove different types of contaminants through different methods such as biosorption bioaccumulation and biodegradation it has been observed that microalgae can remove the pollutants originated from the domestic effluents agricultural runoffs textile leather pharmaceutical and electroplating industries etc additionally the microalgae have the ability to mitigate the carbon dioxide in their growth process and utilize the micronutrients in the effluents this review paper critically analysed the application of microalgae for the remediation of diverse types of pollutants commonly present in the environment through different mechanisms keywords microalgae bioremediation biosorption environmental remediation phycoremediation carbon dioxide mitigation 1 introduction industrialization urbanization and technology development results in the generation of the complex and toxic pollution 1 toxic pollutants like heavy metals hydrocarbons and chemicals can enter the environment by their direct or indirect release from industry municipal waste and agriculture 2 3 these contaminants result in the loss of diversity in the ecosystem as well as an increase in the toxins in the human food chain 4 5 the disturbance in the environment degrades the quality of life and cause numerous diseases 6 7 different approaches such as evaporation precipitation ion exchange advanced aerobic degradation biological oxidation oxidation processes ozonation coagulation membrane filtration solid phase extraction nano filtration photocatalytic degradation and electrochemical degradation have been developed for the elimination of such contaminants 8 13 though these methods have some disadvantages like the generation of toxic sludge or other waste products incomplete removal of metals high reagent and energy requirements 14 18 the bioremediation has been emerged as an eco friendly substitute for the wastewater treatment process 19 in bioremediation microorganisms are used to remove or metabolize the toxic substances to non toxic moieties it is considered as a cost effective and efficient alternative to conventional approaches 20 21 the use of fungi 22 bacteria 23 and microalgae 24 25 reported to be efficient in the bioremediation of wastewater in this regard the microalgae are believed to be a potential candidate for the removal of toxic substances because they can efficiently remove toxic substances from the surrounding through their various ways of nutrition 26 32 i e heterotrophy mixotrophy and phototrophy 33 microalgae convert these toxic elements into a considerable level by accumulation adsorption and metabolization the unique ability of microalgae to photosynthesize and to utilize carbon substrates as compared to other organisms is termed as phycoremediation 34 microalgae can decrease the amount of co2 from the atmosphere due to their photosynthetic ability as well as their ability to bio fixing of co2 35 moreover microalgae can reproduce in wastewater by using micronutrients already present in wastewater figs 1 3 carbohydrates present in the cell wall of microalgae make them capable of absorbing toxic chemicals like heavy metals phosphorous p nitrogen n and other compounds from wastewater so microalgae are suitable for the removal of different types of compounds present in wastewaters the ability of microalgae to utilize numerous compounds such as endocrine disruptors hydrocarbons pesticides and cyanides have also been documented 34 36 2 microalgae microalgae size ranged in few micro metres to hundreds of micro metres and are unicellular or have a simple multicellular structure and their simpler structure is the reason for their high growth rate 5 37 microalgae are prokaryotic eukaryotic photosynthetic and can live in diverse conditions 38 the microalgae find application in different fields that depends upon microalgae selection and suitable culture conditions for their growth and biomass production 5 microalgae are exceptional for remediation because a broad range of toxic and other wastes can be remedied using algae pollutants can be used as nutrients and degraded enzymatically by algae 39 so using microalgae improves the treatment methods of wastewater and decreases the burden of the organic pollutant from the medium 40 41 microalgae are able to scavenge a broad category of pollutants from agricultural domestic and industrial sectors microalgae not only remediate the phosphates nitrates ammonium and other organic and inorganic pollutants present in wastewater but can also absorb and degrade the persisting molecules such as heavy metals ppcps hcs edcs and antibiotics 42 43 because of their ability to photosynthesize 44 microalgae can easily capture co2 gas and form important by products such as lipids vitamins and carbohydrates 45 moreover oxygen produced by photosynthesis can reduce the bod of the wastewater 46 synechoccystis c gloeocapsa scenedesmus anabaena o chroococcus lyngbya and spirulina etc are some microalgae which are used commonly to treat wastewater 39 3 processes involved in the remediation of pollutants different mechanisms i e biosorption bioaccumulation and biodegradation are involved in the environmental remediation by using microalgae 3 1 biosorption it is considered that biosorption is a passive process 47 and by using this method microalgae are able to remove organic pollutants like aromatic compounds and pesticides chelation complexation adsorption electrostatic interaction surface precipitation and ion exchange are reported to be involved in the process of biosorption using microalgae 48 49 so the binding moieties on the surface significantly affect the efficiency to adsorb pollutants 50 sulphated polysaccharides carbohydrates intercellular spaces and a fibril matrix present on the cell wall that could assist in the adsorption of organic contaminants from wastewater 34 furthermore several binding sites like oh so4 2 nh2 and coo functional groups are also present uniformly on the cell wall of microalgae 51 because of microalgal surface properties and retention capacities its biomass can be used as a biosorbent to treat the effluents 48 52 adsorption phenomena were used by synechocystis sp and scenedesmus sp to remove diclofenac from water it was observed that the biomass of scenedesmus sp is able to remove 28 mg g and the biomass of synechocystis sp can remove the 20 mg g of diclofenac 53 also al homaidan et al 54 documented that c glomerata e intestinalis and m amoena have good bioadsorption capacity to remove the cr 6 from aqueous solution c glomerata shows maximum adsorption capacity and removes 66 6 of cr 6 using 1 0 g dried algal cells 100 ml at 45 c and ph 2 0 54 3 2 bioaccumulation bioaccumulation is considered as an active process 47 and living biomass is used in this process to detoxify the wastes 51 in this process the biomass uptake the substances through the surfaces and uptake of nutrients 55 compounds are then accumulated or metabolized according to the type of biomass 47 it can also be defined as the process in which organic and inorganic pollutants i e heavy metals and pesticides nitrates sulfates and phosphates are transferred inside the cells of the living organism and are removed from aqueous solutions 56 bioaccumulation process is characterized using bioconcentration factor that is the ratio of the concentration of a pollutant adsorbent and in the media 55 bioaccumulation of zn al fe cd and cu by using o bornettia c vulgaris e acus and p curvicauda was reported the highest metal concentration factor seen for oscillatoria is 0 306 for zn 0 302 for fe 0 091 for cu and 0 276 for cd whereas the highest value for bioconcentration of al was shown by p curvicauda and e acus that was 0 439 57 3 3 biodegradation biodegradation is considered as an essential process to remove the contaminants from effluents with the help of microbes 58 microalgae have the ability to degrade organic matter present in the water into small molecules which in turn used by them as nutrients for their growth 59 it has been observed the algae are capable to degrade the pollutants and transform them to intermediates or by enhancing the degradation potential of the microbial community present around the ability of microalgae to degrade harmful organic pollutants is documented for example microalgae had increased the biodegradation rate of caffeine up to 99 60 it was also reported that the n muscorum s platensis and a oryzae can biodegrade malathion and efficiencies were 91 54 and 65 respectively 61 it was also observed that the microalgae can biodegrade or biotransform organic pollutants via metabolic action by accumulating the pollutant and resultantly degrade it via transformation and mineralization 62 it was exhibited that naphthalene can be degraded into four significant metabolites trans naphthalene dihydrodiol cis naphthalene dihydrodiol 4 hydrox 4 tetralone and 1 naphthol by both eukaryotic microalgae and blue green algae these metabolites were produced at a non toxic concentration 63 aldaby and mawad reported that the degradation capacity of oscillatoria sp for py that was significantly surpassed than that of the chlorella sp under the same incubation condition and at 50 and 100 mg l concentration of py it was observed that the oscillatoria sp have ability to 95 py whereas chlorella sp has the ability to degrade 78 71 of py at 50 mg l concentration of py and 30 days of incubation time it was also observed that py at 10 and 30 mg l is completely degraded by both strains 64 4 environmental applications 4 1 co2 mitigation by microalgae climate change is caused by greenhouse gases and co2 is the major greenhouse gas that causes global warming and 68 of total emissions account for co2 according to the kyoto protocol the release of greenhouse gas should be reduced by 5 2 relative to the emissions in 1990 65 the co2 concentration in the atmosphere is not only the cause of global warming but also results in a 30 increase in the acidity of the ocean which in turn adversely affects biodiversity 66 67 since ghg affects human life as well as the global environment there is a need to provide solutions to fix this problem in the recent era many research and development projects have been executed to reduce co2 in this regard co2 is converted into hcs and organic carbon like lipids by a process known as the co2 fixation process 34 physical chemical and biological methods were some of the reported methods the biological method is trustworthy among all the methods in a biological approach microalgae are mostly used in co2 biofixation due to their high biomass productivity photosynthetic performance high lipid accumulation and valuable non fuel co products 68 the ability of microalgae to accumulate polyunsaturated fatty acid and lipid increases with the increase in the concentration of co2 in media which results in an increase in the yield of biodiesel by microalgae 69 70 moreover biodiesel produced by microalgae is exceptionally eco friendly and does not contain toxic materials or sulfur 71 co2 is accumulated in algal biomass and then converted into products such as renewable biofuels vitamins and proteins 72 animal and aquaculture feed products food and other beneficial products such as nutraceuticals cosmetics bio fertilizers and pharmaceuticals 73 it is believed that microalgae are 10 50 times more efficient than terrestrial plants because of their rapid growth simpler structure and ability to use carbon as a nutrient 5 73 74 microalgae can be cultivated by using co2 of flue gas from power plants or by using atmospheric co2 in the raceway pond 5 72 75 different microalgae species show a different level of tolerance to the co2 concentration of flue gas 34 microalgae are divided into three categories according to their capacity of co2 tolerance i co2 sensitive species inhibited by mere 2 5 co2 ii species that can tolerate 5 20 co2 co2 tolerant species iii species that can tolerate 20 100 co2 extreme co2 tolerant species 34 there are only limited species of microalgae that have shown remarkable tolerance to a high concentration of co2 e g arthrospira spp chlorella spp s dimorphus n oculate and b braunii however it was reported that scenedesmus spp exhibited more tolerance than chlorella spp in high concentrations of co2 i e 10 80 whereas both species have the ability to grow in low concentration of co2 i e 10 30 furthermore it was also observed that the growth of scenedesmus spp was inhibited in a 100 concentration of co2 but this inhibition effect can be reversed by returning the co2 concentration to 20 76 a mutant of chlorella spp strain kr 1 was also reported which has the ability to grow under as high as 70 co2 concentration 77 the co2 fixation rate by microalgae decreases with a low concentration of co2 and a high flow rate it was reported that when chlorella sp was grown in different co2 concentrations i e 1 75 and 9 45 as well as the different flow rate of co2 the maximum growth rate was shown by the chlorella sp i e 1 75 at 50 ml min flow rate of co2 this concentration of co2 also resulted in maximum biomass production high co2 concentration decreases the ph to less than 5 5 which in turn could prevent algae from growing a decrease in co2 supplementation decreased the concentration of biomass noticeably so the results indicated that the co2 fixation efficiency of microalgae might decrease at low concentration and high flow rate of co2 78 moreover it was observed that some species of microalgae could be cultivated by using 10 15 co2 69 but high levels of flue gas components like metals nox and sox and may cause cell growth to be inhibited in some microalgal species 79 recently the effect of the irregular wastes i e co2 so2 no and ash present in the flue gas of a coal power plant on the co2 biofixation growth parameters and biomass characterization of c fusca leb 111 was evaluated the addition of no and so2 up to 400 ppm did not affect the biofixation of co2 by microalga significantly the best efficiency to fix co2 by microalgae was shown at 200 ppm so2 and no 40 ppm ash and 10 co2 similarly 111 biomass composition of the c fusca leb remained the same in all trials 80 s dimorphus has the ability to tolerate high concentrations of no and co2 it was reported that intermittent sparging with flue gas and ph control plays an important role in overcoming the inhibition of microalgae by flue gas the maximum biomass concentration i e 3 63 g l and highest co2 biofixation of 75 61 was observed by intermittent sparging of flue gases 81 in a symbiotic relationship the microalgae showed higher tolerance a symbiotic c desmodesmus sp 3dp86e 1 from a white sea benthic hydroid d pumila showed tolerance to up to 20 co2 this high level of co2 did not affect the functioning and ultrastructure of the microalgae moreover the rate of growth of the culture had also increased by two folds however the amount of photosynthetic carbon to be assimilated along with the effective delivery of the photosynthates to biosynthesize the structural cell components is decisive for the efficient growth of microalgae at a higher concentration of co2 these abilities of the symbiotic microalgae make them appropriate to be used in the advanced technologies to mitigate co2 82 many other microalgae species have equally been reported for biomitigation of co2 table 1 4 2 bioremediation of domestic effluents inorganic chemicals such as nitrates and phosphate and organic compounds are the main pollutants in the domestic effluents so c p and n are the three main pollutants present in urban wastewaters 33 these pollutants cause eutrophication which in turn resulted in the depletion of oxygen in water 90 this is a global problem that can be resolved by using microalgae as the microalgae have the ability to use wastewater as feed for their growth microalgae during growth accumulate and remove the excess nutrients from wastewater a wide range of microalgae like spirulina scenedesmus chlamydomonas chlorella and botryococcus is used for bioremediation of the domestic wastewater 63 4 2 1 removal of inorganic nutrients detergents are the reason for approximately 50 of the total p in the domestic effluent whereas metabolic interconversion release of n the n and p are present in the form of ammonia nitrate nitrite and orthophosphate in wastewater the elimination process of these nutrients is recognized as nutrient desorbing 5 nitrites nitrates and ammonium are important nutrient sources for the microalgae 91 microalgae assimilate these nutrients into their cells for growth and play a role in the remediation of wastewater 5 whereas phosphates are used as intermediates in the metabolic activity of carbohydrate 91 microalgae remove n by assimilation and the phenomena to remove p are not understood yet two metabolic processes are under debate to describe the mechanism for p removal 1 assimilation of p by algae for their growth and 2 uptake and storage of p as polyphosphates in the algal biomass 92 microalgae can produce 100 t of biomass by using approximately 1 t of p and 5 t of n 93 in recent studies it is reported that the pure and mixed cultures of microalgae can remove inorganic nutrients including n and p in the range of 80 100 94 95 biomass production potential of 9 native microalgae consortia was evaluated in livestock wastewater having high strength as well as rural sector wastewater having low strength it was observed that all native consortia have the ability to reduce 80 100 nutrients from wastewater after 12 days of batch culture under controlled conditions 94 moreover the immobilized algae removed inorganic nutrients from effluents is alternative to harvesting microalgal biomass from suspended culture and considered as a cost effective method the co culture with activated sludge to alginate immobilized microalgae c vulgaris inoculum ratios r was examined for the removal performances for n and p and organic pollutants the highest performance was shown by the reactor having r 0 5 indicating 66 and 95 removal of n after 24 h and 84 h respectively the p was removed completely in the co culture system after 24 h whereas p was removed completely after 36 h in the pure c vulgaris culture 96 recently a prototype scale twin layer photobioreactor was designed using immobilized green alga h rubescens in vertical sheet like surfaces and employed for the treatment of municipal wastewater the results showed 70 99 of p and n was removed efficiently from 22 effluents depending on the type of wastewater and elements present in it 97 moreover the ability of microalgae to remove the p and n from the domestic wastewater was improved by adding microalgae to a sequencing batch biofilm reactor to form a unique algal bacterial symbiotic system results depicted that the algae assisted sequencing batch biofilm reactor increased removal efficiencies for the total p and n from 31 9 to 89 3 and from 38 5 to 65 8 respectively 98 4 2 2 removal of organic pollutant there is a high level of organic pollutants in domestic wastewater which are biodegradable 99 these organic pollutants when discharged result in the increase of the pollution load like cod bod and tss both chemical and biological methods are used to oxidize carbon atoms present in organic pollutants into co2 bod uses the capability of microorganisms to change organic pollutant into co2 and h2o in the presence of the oxidizing agent i e o2 the dissolved o2 of water can be depleted due to surplus bod leading to anaerobiosis and fish kills 40 thus organic pollutants result in the degradation of the water quality by depleting o2 which damage to the aquatic environment 99 microalgae have the ability to decrease the organic load besides mineral pollutants 33 moreover algae enhanced its efficiency for the removal of bod from domestic wastewater by making a symbiotic relationship with bacteria by providing o2 100 it was reported that the chlorella has the ability to reduce 75 of the organic substances from kitchen wastewater the efficiency of microalgae to remove cod from kitchen wastewater was also evaluated in the first four days cod decreased slowly in kww and then cod concentration was retained at the constant level and changed in a small range this happened because microalgae were unable to use some organic sources present in kww the ultimate removal efficiency of microalgae for cod was 32 14 in kww 101 the effectiveness of botryococcus sp to clean gw in phytoremediation treatment was also investigated the results indicated that botryococcus sp is effective in reducing 88 cod and 82 bod furthermore botryococcussp removed 83 cod 82 tic 68 bod at 50 concentration of gw 102 in another study it was concluded that the chlamydomonas sp scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp are able to remove 10 34 11 46 g bod m2 day and 14 3 15 33 g cod m2 day by using 300 mm using deep high rate algal pond 103 it was also observed that the cod removal was constant using spirogyra sp this might be due to the already low initial concentrations of cod in the wastewater or due to the sterile conditions in the reactors it was predicted that unsterilized wastewater causes higher cod removal 104 a number of microalgae species have been studied for wastewater treatment and a promising efficiency has been reported table 2 5 bioremediation of industrial effluent the one of main pollution sources of the environmental pollution are industries the type and level of pollutants released into the environment depend on the industry industrial wastewater includes process wastes from the manufacturing process sanitary waste washing during cooling and heating operations 117 the composition of wastewater is highly diverse as it depends on the sources and sites of the effluents 118 these industrial discharge include pesticides dioxins heavy metals poly aromatic hydrocarbons pahs polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs phenolic compounds petrochemicals and microorganisms 117 119 121 pollutants from industries release into water sheds and cause an increase in cod bod tss tds toxic metals such as pb cr cd and ni thus make the water inappropriate for irrigation drinking as well as aquatic life 117 these industrial effluents are the reason for long term consequences on the functioning of the ecosystem which involve changes in the availability of food and self regulating capacity of the biosphere 118 122 123 5 1 effluents from the textile industry effluents from the textile industry are considered as the main source of water pollution because of the worldwide increase in the textile industries and presence of diverse type of dyes in wastewaters 124 126 variable ph higher salinity cod high temperature and color are some of the characteristics of the textile wastewater 118 127 in the textile industry the desired quality and color of the fabric is obtained by using dyes and auxiliary chemicals 128 the use of synthetic dyes has been increased in the dyeing and textile industries because of their high stability to light resistant to microbial attack and temperature ease in use cost effectiveness in synthesis and diversity in color imparted by them in comparison to natural dyes 129 these dyes lost in the environment and cause problems as they have a fixation efficiency of 60 90 124 the water discharged from the dying process contain dyes heavy metals salts pigments inorganic and organic pollutants 130 131 this wastewater is the reason for pollution eutrophication change in transparency gas solubility and ph of water decrease in the dissolved oxygen do photosynthetic activity and increase in the cod the synthetic dyes are reluctant to biodegradation because of their aromatic structure and xenobiotic nature they reduce the light penetration in water and restrict the phenomena of photosynthesis thus affecting the flora and fauna 127 132 so it is necessary to treat these industrial effluents before discharging them into the environment 124 enzymatic and microbial degradation has gained considerable importance for the removal of dyes as it is a sludge free inexpensive and environmentally friendly process 133 micro algae is considered best to remediate the textile effluent by removing p c and n which in turn reduces the eutrophication 134 microalgae cultivated in textile wastewater uses nutrients and dyes present in it for its growth bioaccumulation and biosorption are the two processes for the bioremediation of the wastewater 127 135 136 in the bioconversion process dyes are consumed by microalgae as a source of carbon and converted into metabolites however in biosorbent process dyes get adsorbed on the surface of microalgae moreover these phenomena can also occur simultaneously for wastewater treatment of the textile industry 135 additionally both dead and living microalgae can be used in these phenomena however removal of dyes by the adsorption process can occur exclusively by using dead microalgae 127 131 the ability of algae to degrade dyes depends on the specie of algae being used and the structure of dyes sasikala and sudha 2014 studied the decolorization ability of different algal species separated from numerous sources the best ability to decolorize twelve different reactive and azo dyes were shown by gloeocapsa sp phormidium sp and aphanotheca sp aphanotheca sp was found to remove 83 of blue mezrl and 90 of orange m2r after 20 days moreover 69 of navy blue m3r and 59 of red acid crude after 10 days of incubation was removed only oscillatoria sp was able to remove orange me2rl which also did not show significant removal in the early incubation period 128 also aragaw et al 2018 used microalgae in a photobioreactor to treat the textile wastewater and microalgal bioreactor has the capacity to remove bod cod and tds by 91 90 91 50 and 89 10 respectively 128 biosorption of tww by microalgae was also carried out similar to bioconversion 131 it was observed that the powdered biomass of c vulgaris is an effective adsorbent for the removal of orange g dye it was observed that maximum biosorption capacity was 38 of c vulgaris 137 a consortium performed better than the single system for the simultaneous removal of nutrients and dyes a 98 09 decolorization of the dispersed red 3b rate was obtained by using consortium at optimized conditions the tp cod and ammonical n were removed up to 83 9 93 9 and 87 6 respectively 138 the immobilized algae also showed better efficiencies than suspended cultures in bioremediation applications a polysulfone nanofibrous web microalgae psu nfw was used for microalgae immobilized and same was applied for the removal of rb221 and rb5 dyes the microalgae psu nfw decolorize about 72 97 0 3 of rb5 whereas pristine psu nfw decolorizes 12 36 0 3 of rb5 for the rb221 solution the decolorization rates of pristine psu nfw and microalgae psu nfw were 5 51 0 4 and 30 2 0 23 respectively 139 table 3 5 2 effluents from tanneries in tannery the transformation of leather takes place it is one of the oldest industries in the world the raw materials and inputs used in this process are vulnerable to the environment 156 there are two methods which are used in for tanning i vegetable tanning ii chrome tanning 157 effluents having several chemical compounds are generated in leather processing during the wet finishing process these effluents contain chemical compounds such as fatliquoring oils neutralization salts retanning agents dyes surfactant polymers solvents resins pigments and other chemicals 4 generally wastewater of tanneries is brown has basic ph and a high concentration of organic substances that differ based on chemicals being used 158 dyes added in the last steps to give interior and surface coloration to leather are responsible for the generation of wastewater with a high concentration of dyes 159 moreover ammonium salts sulphates and chlorides are used during dehairing and deliming process that are responsible for pollution of water sheds 158 besides water from tanneries not only has a considerable amount of degradable organic waste like organic n and fats and proteins but also a major quantity of inorganic contaminants and toxic heavy metals particularly cr 6 sulphides chlorides with high bod and cod 156 158 160 a 90 of the water used in tanneries is released as effluent 161 these effluents are highly toxic and need to be treated by advanced methods before being discharged into the water sources 160 several studies have been reported the efficiency to utilize the microalgae to bioremediate the effluents from the tanneries a microalgal consortium was evaluated for the treatment of wastewater from a tannery three types of effluents i e effluent after primary treatment 50pe50w raw effluent 50re50w and effluent after primary and secondary biological treatment 50be50w were employed for microalgae growth the highest biomass concentration of 1 77 g l was presented by the 50pe50w after 16 days of cultivation it was observed that this microalgal consortium is able to remove 99 90 51 02 91 75 and 82 88 for n nh3 cod p po4 and tkn respectively from all types of effluents 160 also the effect of photoperiod on the efficiency of microalgae was studies including raw wastewater r and wastewater after secondary biological treatment were employed for microalgal growth in 24 h of photoperiod and 12 h of light constant aeration and 25 c of temperature the maximum biomass concentration of 1 40 g l for 75r25b effluent p removal of 97 94 for the 50r50b ammonia removal of 100 for both effluent and n removal of 71 53 for the 50r50b was obtained in the 24 h condition it was also observed that the metabolism of p and n present in wastewater and metabolic activities is directly linked to the production of biomass 162 it was also observed that the immobilized algal cells have more capacity to remove effluents from tannery wastewater than free cells jaysudha et al 163 reported that 99 39 of phosphate was removed by immobilized cells on the 8th day whereas algae free beads and free algal cells absorbed only 37 41 and 81 94 respectively likewise 98 71 of phosphate was also removed by immobilized cells on the 8th day whereas the free algal cells and without microalgal beads removed only 65 83 and 43 71 respectively finally 98 54 of ammonia was removed by immobilized cells on the 4th day of incubation when compared to free algal cells and algae free beads in 62 04 and 24 94 respectively 163 the phycoremediation integrated with the ozone process can be considered as a practicable treatment method for tannery effluent along with enhanced biomass production in this process a partially treated tannery effluent by ozonation was coupled with phycoremediation it was observed that this combination results in the maximum reduction in the concentration of pollutant with 84 reduction in cod 100 in odor 60 in color 82 n nh4 n 97 in chromium 90 in inorganic carbon 100 in po4 p and 10 in tds 164 table 4 5 3 effluents from pharmaceuticals industries wastes generated by the pharmaceutical industry during the process of drug production are known as pharmaceutical effluents the presence of persistent substances resulted in the inadequate treatment of effluents from the pharmaceutical industries 175 177 some of the characteristic pharmaceuticals in the wastewater of pharmaceutical include lipid regulators antibiotics antiepileptic psychiatric drugs anti inflammatories diuretics analgesics and β blockers each of which is present in the different composition in the effluent 175 178 179 these pharmaceutical active substances used in low doses produce specific biological effects on living organisms these pharmaceuticals prove to be toxic for the living organisms due to their ability to interact with living organisms after absorption 178 180 the industry is distinguished by the plant sizes a range of production processes as well as quality and quantity of wastewater in fact diversity of processes and operation in the pharmaceutical industry due to diversity in products makes it almost impossible to define the characteristic pharmaceutical effluent however it contains a high amount of bod cod and nitrate which put a hazard to both aquatic environment and humans when released to the environment without any treatment 175 pharmaceutical compounds are considered emerging environmental pollutants and are difficult to be removed by using conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps and transferred to groundwater and surface waters 181 bioadsorption photolysis bioaccumulation and biodegradation have been suggested as the main processes involved in the removal of micropollutants and these emerging organic pharmaceutical contaminants by microalgae 182 183 the use of microalgae is a sunlight driven sustainable and ecological retrieval strategy for the removal of pollutants pharmaceutical industry 183 recent studies had shown that c sorokiniana can remove the salicylic acid and paracetamol from an artificial medium 184 as well as numerous other micro pollutants from anaerobically digested black water and urine 185 however further use of algal biomass is limited because of the accumulation of contaminants in the algal biomass 183 some other algal strains used for the bioremediation of pharmaceutical effluents are listed in table 5 5 4 effluents from electroplating and mining industries electroplating is an electrochemical process used for the surface treatment of metal metals commonly used for coatings are ag cd ni cu au and similar metals 200 201 the solution of the metal which is usually in the form of chromic acid copper cyanide or cadmium oxide is placed in the plating baths 202 203 the effluents from electroplating industries are both alkaline and acidic high tds heavy metals like ni cr and cd etc are the characteristics of the acidic effluent whereas the alkaline effluent is produced during the coating of paint to wheels and contains heavy metals and calcium chloride 204 thus the effluents from electroplating and other metal processing industries have considerable amounts of toxic metal ions chromates cyanides alkalis and acids 118 202 such toxicity can pollute the nearby biotic and abiotic environment so these wastes need to be treated before their discharge into water sheds and their concentration does not exceed the maximum permissible which cause highly toxic effects to the living organisms beyond the permissible limits 200 205 206 the ability of heavy metal ions to bioaccumulate and biosorbed in aquatic food chains can pass these metal ions to humans causing major health problems 207 209 these are toxic to humans even at low concentrations for example the high toxicity of lead results in damage to the kidneys nervous system and disturbance in the metabolism of vitamin d especially in children nickel compounds are considered as carcinogenic 200 and long term contact with cd can cause bone mineral loss kidney damage reduced lung function and increased risk of bone fractures 118 cyanide is also a toxic specie that is commonly present in the industrial effluents produced by metallurgical operations it has a strong ability to bind with metals making it suitable for metal finishing and as a lixiviant for leaching metals especially gold 210 211 however exposure to cyanide induces negative health effects on humans and wildlife 211 the conventional methods of industrial wastewater treatment such as ion exchange precipitation and electrochemical methods 212 are not cost effective for the removal of metal ions on a large scale nowadays algae both micro and macro algae biomass is used as a non conventional means for the remediation of heavy metal ions 118 bioaccumulation of heavy metal ions by microorganisms normally occurs in two steps 213 the first step involves the inactive biosorption which occurs on the cell surface and is entirely independent of cellular metabolism the second step depends on cell metabolism and involves active sorption of heavy metal ions into the cytoplasm of algal cells 213 214 the sorption capability of the surface of an algae cell to a certain ion also depends on different factors such as the coordination number of the metal ion to be sorbed the number of functional groups on the surface of algae cells the availability of binding groups to metal ions the chemical state of these sites and the complex formation constants of these functional groups with a metal ion 118 the presence of different types of binding groups on the algal cell surface i e hydroxyl carboxyl phosphoryl amine sulphuryl imidazole sulfate phosphate carbohydrate thiol ether etc enhance the adsorption of metal ions 215 216 these binding groups are present at the cell surface as well as in the cytoplasm and particularly vacuoles 118 microalgae have the ability to form complexes of heavy metals and cellular proteins without altering their activity 216 these organometallic complexes are further moved insides vacuoles to regulate the concentration of heavy metal ions in the cytoplasm which results in the subsequent mitigation of their toxic effects 217 it was reported that the presence of sulfonic and carboxylic functional groups on the surface of the macro algae p canaliculata is the reason for the remediation of zn and cu ions from the aqueous solutions 218 similarly carboxyl hydroxyl amino and carbonyl groups present on the surface of freshwater algae anabaenaphaerica proved to have a major role in biosorption of pb and cd ions 219 however cyanide is degraded by several algal strains due to their ability to use it as a source of carbon and n for their growth 220 it was observed that a particular algal strain may show selective interaction with a particular heavy metal ion moreover the removal of heavy metal ions largely depends on the biomass concentration and initial concentration of metal ions 118 for example it was reported that the marine algae u fasciata and u lactuca have the ability to adsorb the cd at different culture conditions it was observed that the biosorption capacity of both microalgae increases by increasing ph from 3 to 8 and changing the temperature between 20 30 c the results demonstrated that the biosorption efficiency for cd increased with increasing concentration of u fasciata biosorbent and afterwards it decreased moreover the biosorption was decreased by increasing the concentration of cd in the case of u fasciata in the case of u lactuca biosorption efficiency was increased by increasing the concentration of cd from 20 to 30 mg l the results indicated that the maximum adsorption capacity shown by u fasciata is 8 353 mg g for cd whereas maximum adsorption capacity is shown by u lactuca 8 804 mg g for cd at optimum conditions 221 the dead biomass is considered preferable over the living biomass as there is no need for culture growth media in case of dead biomass these growth media in turn increase the bod and cod of the industrial wastewater moreover the dead biomass biosorbent is generally not influenced by the toxicity of heavy metals 222 the performance of the dead algal biomass can be enhanced by modifying it via activation methods bulgariu and its co worker activated the algal waste attained after extraction of oil by alkaline treatment and utilized it for the removal of cd in column and batch systems it was concluded that alkaline modification of the waste biomass of algae can be used to enhance the removal efficiency of the biosorbent as well as to remove the traces of organic solvents easily from the composition of biomass furthermore it was observed that cd removal by at awb has higher biosorption potential i e 41 88 mg g in a 10 min as compared to the untreated algal waste biomass which shows biosorption potential of 33 71 mg g in a contact time of 30 min it was concluded that the enhancement of the biosorption of waste algal biomass is associated with the increase in the accessibility of functional groups after alkaline treatment 223 the efficiency of the algal biomass can also be enhanced by immobilization the adsorption capacity of freely suspended and ca alginate immobilized c vulgaris cells was compared for the biosorption of fe ii zn ii and mn ii ions from the aqueous solution it was observed that the 43 43 mg g fe ii 40 98 mg g mn ii and 37 43 mg g of zn ii were absorbed by algal cells immobilized with ca alginate at optimum algal cells dose of 0 6 g l ph of 6 0 and contact time of 450 min at room temperature the biosorption effectiveness of freely suspended and immobilized c vulgaris cells to remove heavy metals from the industrial wastewater was authenticated it was concluded that the biosorption activity of the algal cells is enhanced by immobilizing the algal cells in alginate beads 224 efforts have been made to integrate the co2 mitigation wastewater treatment and bioenergy production processes in photobioreactors based on microalgae 102 in such a study the influence of co2 and organic matter om addition on the bioremediation potential of two microalgae s almeriensis and c vulgaris was evaluated it was concluded that the addition of co2 and om decrease the biosorption capacity of both microalgal species and it also inhibited the growth of c vulgaris 225 some other algal strains used for the bioremediation of effluents from electroplating and mining industries in different forms have been listed in the table 6 6 effluents from agricultural runoff the continuous increase in the world population has increased the demand for food which in turn has overburdened the agricultural system the desire to cultivate more food has resulted in the higher use of fertilizers and pesticides random use of agrochemicals has not only increased the production but also proved to be very dangerous to the environment as it has polluted the natural resources 235 mainly pesticides remain in the ecosystem because of their persistent nature of high solubility and cause harmful effects due to its toxicity they can cause acute harm to micro fauna and flora so disturbing the working of ecosystems 41 236 it was considered that the main cause of pollution in rural areas is agrochemicals from agricultural fields inorganic fertilizers which contain high quantities of n k p and organic carbon are applied regularly in fields in the harvesting season as well as in the pre harvest period together with herbicides and pesticides as a result these compounds which are highly soluble move easily into the soil thus agricultural runoff has a wide range of contaminants such as pesticides herbicides nutrients n p and heavy metals 237 pesticides residues also affects the beneficial organisms like spiders earth worms plants bees and cause natural decay besides polluting the environment including the soil 238 organochlorine pesticides are considered as the most problematic among the various pesticides used 239 in human pesticides cause symptoms like inflammation of the throat and nose itchy skin headache blisters on the skin rash vomiting tingling of the skin and eyes dizziness nausea diarrhoea a blurred vision even blindness and sometimes deaths normally in 24 h 41 algae may be utilized as biofertilizers or soil conditioners 240 the biodegradation of pesticides as well as treatment of other effluents from agricultural runoff by algae and cyanobacteria have been reported for example garcía galán evaluated the growth of the microalgae pediastrum sp scenedesmus sp chlorella sp and gloeothece sp cyanobacteria by using agricultural runoff as feedstock in semi closed hybrid tubular horizontal photobioreactor hth pbr in this study a 22 increase in biomass as well as complete removal of all nutrients were observed in 4 and 2 days respectively during the batch study 237 similarly the efficiency of pbrs which is a microalgae based technology was evaluated to remove nutrients from agricultural runoffs it was observed that the microalgae activity has a strong dependency on seasonal changes in solar radiation and temperature these seasonal changes led to an increase in ph values in the mixed liquor detected in summer and great changes in the production of biomass between seasons i e 43 g vss m3 d in summer to 7 g vss m3 d in winter it was inferred that the average n removal efficiency ranged from 50 in winter to 90 in summer the removal efficiency of p was greater than 95 in almost all cases 241 another study evaluates the growth of the microalgae n oculata in the presence of pesticide lindane and the ability of n oculata to remove it from the media n oculata removed 68 2 and 73 of lindane in the 0 5 and 0 1 mg l media concentrations respectively n oculata eradicated lindane from the media at concentration lower than 1 0 mg thus n oculata may be useful for lindane bioremediation in contaminated aquatic systems 59 another study was conducted to evaluate whether fungal assisted algal cultivation can also remediate the pesticides from contaminated water or not in this experiment c vulgaris microalga a niger the filamentous fungus and the biopellets formed by these microorganisms were investigated against 38 pesticides it was observed that treatment by biopellets significantly decreases the concentration of the 17 of these pesticides as compared to control however treatment with algae did not have any significant effect on the concentration of pesticides as compared to control further treatment by fungus lowers the concentration of pesticides by 59 6 2 0 g l and treatment by biopellets lowers the pesticide concentration by 56 1 2 8 g l as compared to the control which reduces the concentration of the pesticide by 66 6 1 0 g l thus biopellet formed by fungal assisted algal harvesting can also provide a possibility for the removal of organic pollutants from wastewater with a major role played by the fungus 242 it was suggested that the different microalgal species can tolerate a specific concentration of any particular pesticide the ability to withstand certain concentrations of specific pesticides varies among different species of microalgae when pesticides are present in a sublethal concentration microalgae not only have the ability to bioaccumulate the pesticides but can also biodegrade them however the metabolic pathway of the microalgal is considered as an area that needs to be explored to remediate the pesticides in future researches 34 esperanza et al 256 reported that the exposure of c reinhardtii to the sublethal concentration of atrazine for 3 and 24 h results in an alteration in a gene associated with catabolism of amino acid and respiratory cellular process it was recommended that photosynthesis was hindered and the algal cell was pushed to go for heterotrophic metabolism for their survival 242 in the same ways several studies were conducted to evaluate the removal efficiency of different kinds of microalgae for pesticides and other agricultural wastes table 7 findings revealed that bioremediation is a viable approach for the for treatment of effluents having different types of pollutants like dyes metal ions pharmaceutical agents inorganic and organic toxic pollutants 243 244 7 conclusions and prospects there are several methods to remove toxic contaminants and wastes from the environment however remediation from microalgal species is a cost effective and promising approach for the removal of contaminants it is present abundantly in nature and considered as one of the most suitable environment control methods they have diversity in their taxonomy structure and cope under harsh conditions it is deduced that different types of environmental pollutants can be remediated by using algal species certain microalgal species are used to remove specific pollutants by degradation and others remove the environmental pollutants by bioaccumulation and biotransformation it can reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide bioremediation of domestic effluents effluents from agricultural runoff and industrial effluents which may involve the effluents from the textile industry leather industry electroplating industry and pharmaceutical industry further wastewater is a rich source of inorganic and organic nutrients that are consumed by microalgae phycoremediation not only to improve the yields of biomass but also to produce other valuable products like lipids carbohydrates proteins and pigments the efficiency of the microalgae can also be enhanced by immobilizing the algal cells by utilizing binary cultures microalgae microalgae microalgae fungi microalgae bacteria associations or by pre treating the algal biomass to enhance the active sites moreover another benefit of cultivating the microalgae in the wastewater is the production of biodiesel and feed for animals the use of microalgae is an efficient and cost effective technique as compare to other conventional techniques for environmental remediation and production of valuables products declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13520,environmental pollution is increasing day by day due to anthropogenic activities and different types of toxic contaminants such as heavy metals chemicals dyes pesticides etc enter the environment from different sources such as municipal industries and agricultural among wastewater treatment techniques bioremediation is one of promising techniques which utilize the inherent biological mechanism of plant and microorganism for the remediation of diverse pollutants microalgae have been applied to mitigate the toxic and recalcitrant pollutants in the effluents microalgae have the capacity to remove different types of contaminants through different methods such as biosorption bioaccumulation and biodegradation it has been observed that microalgae can remove the pollutants originated from the domestic effluents agricultural runoffs textile leather pharmaceutical and electroplating industries etc additionally the microalgae have the ability to mitigate the carbon dioxide in their growth process and utilize the micronutrients in the effluents this review paper critically analysed the application of microalgae for the remediation of diverse types of pollutants commonly present in the environment through different mechanisms keywords microalgae bioremediation biosorption environmental remediation phycoremediation carbon dioxide mitigation 1 introduction industrialization urbanization and technology development results in the generation of the complex and toxic pollution 1 toxic pollutants like heavy metals hydrocarbons and chemicals can enter the environment by their direct or indirect release from industry municipal waste and agriculture 2 3 these contaminants result in the loss of diversity in the ecosystem as well as an increase in the toxins in the human food chain 4 5 the disturbance in the environment degrades the quality of life and cause numerous diseases 6 7 different approaches such as evaporation precipitation ion exchange advanced aerobic degradation biological oxidation oxidation processes ozonation coagulation membrane filtration solid phase extraction nano filtration photocatalytic degradation and electrochemical degradation have been developed for the elimination of such contaminants 8 13 though these methods have some disadvantages like the generation of toxic sludge or other waste products incomplete removal of metals high reagent and energy requirements 14 18 the bioremediation has been emerged as an eco friendly substitute for the wastewater treatment process 19 in bioremediation microorganisms are used to remove or metabolize the toxic substances to non toxic moieties it is considered as a cost effective and efficient alternative to conventional approaches 20 21 the use of fungi 22 bacteria 23 and microalgae 24 25 reported to be efficient in the bioremediation of wastewater in this regard the microalgae are believed to be a potential candidate for the removal of toxic substances because they can efficiently remove toxic substances from the surrounding through their various ways of nutrition 26 32 i e heterotrophy mixotrophy and phototrophy 33 microalgae convert these toxic elements into a considerable level by accumulation adsorption and metabolization the unique ability of microalgae to photosynthesize and to utilize carbon substrates as compared to other organisms is termed as phycoremediation 34 microalgae can decrease the amount of co2 from the atmosphere due to their photosynthetic ability as well as their ability to bio fixing of co2 35 moreover microalgae can reproduce in wastewater by using micronutrients already present in wastewater figs 1 3 carbohydrates present in the cell wall of microalgae make them capable of absorbing toxic chemicals like heavy metals phosphorous p nitrogen n and other compounds from wastewater so microalgae are suitable for the removal of different types of compounds present in wastewaters the ability of microalgae to utilize numerous compounds such as endocrine disruptors hydrocarbons pesticides and cyanides have also been documented 34 36 2 microalgae microalgae size ranged in few micro metres to hundreds of micro metres and are unicellular or have a simple multicellular structure and their simpler structure is the reason for their high growth rate 5 37 microalgae are prokaryotic eukaryotic photosynthetic and can live in diverse conditions 38 the microalgae find application in different fields that depends upon microalgae selection and suitable culture conditions for their growth and biomass production 5 microalgae are exceptional for remediation because a broad range of toxic and other wastes can be remedied using algae pollutants can be used as nutrients and degraded enzymatically by algae 39 so using microalgae improves the treatment methods of wastewater and decreases the burden of the organic pollutant from the medium 40 41 microalgae are able to scavenge a broad category of pollutants from agricultural domestic and industrial sectors microalgae not only remediate the phosphates nitrates ammonium and other organic and inorganic pollutants present in wastewater but can also absorb and degrade the persisting molecules such as heavy metals ppcps hcs edcs and antibiotics 42 43 because of their ability to photosynthesize 44 microalgae can easily capture co2 gas and form important by products such as lipids vitamins and carbohydrates 45 moreover oxygen produced by photosynthesis can reduce the bod of the wastewater 46 synechoccystis c gloeocapsa scenedesmus anabaena o chroococcus lyngbya and spirulina etc are some microalgae which are used commonly to treat wastewater 39 3 processes involved in the remediation of pollutants different mechanisms i e biosorption bioaccumulation and biodegradation are involved in the environmental remediation by using microalgae 3 1 biosorption it is considered that biosorption is a passive process 47 and by using this method microalgae are able to remove organic pollutants like aromatic compounds and pesticides chelation complexation adsorption electrostatic interaction surface precipitation and ion exchange are reported to be involved in the process of biosorption using microalgae 48 49 so the binding moieties on the surface significantly affect the efficiency to adsorb pollutants 50 sulphated polysaccharides carbohydrates intercellular spaces and a fibril matrix present on the cell wall that could assist in the adsorption of organic contaminants from wastewater 34 furthermore several binding sites like oh so4 2 nh2 and coo functional groups are also present uniformly on the cell wall of microalgae 51 because of microalgal surface properties and retention capacities its biomass can be used as a biosorbent to treat the effluents 48 52 adsorption phenomena were used by synechocystis sp and scenedesmus sp to remove diclofenac from water it was observed that the biomass of scenedesmus sp is able to remove 28 mg g and the biomass of synechocystis sp can remove the 20 mg g of diclofenac 53 also al homaidan et al 54 documented that c glomerata e intestinalis and m amoena have good bioadsorption capacity to remove the cr 6 from aqueous solution c glomerata shows maximum adsorption capacity and removes 66 6 of cr 6 using 1 0 g dried algal cells 100 ml at 45 c and ph 2 0 54 3 2 bioaccumulation bioaccumulation is considered as an active process 47 and living biomass is used in this process to detoxify the wastes 51 in this process the biomass uptake the substances through the surfaces and uptake of nutrients 55 compounds are then accumulated or metabolized according to the type of biomass 47 it can also be defined as the process in which organic and inorganic pollutants i e heavy metals and pesticides nitrates sulfates and phosphates are transferred inside the cells of the living organism and are removed from aqueous solutions 56 bioaccumulation process is characterized using bioconcentration factor that is the ratio of the concentration of a pollutant adsorbent and in the media 55 bioaccumulation of zn al fe cd and cu by using o bornettia c vulgaris e acus and p curvicauda was reported the highest metal concentration factor seen for oscillatoria is 0 306 for zn 0 302 for fe 0 091 for cu and 0 276 for cd whereas the highest value for bioconcentration of al was shown by p curvicauda and e acus that was 0 439 57 3 3 biodegradation biodegradation is considered as an essential process to remove the contaminants from effluents with the help of microbes 58 microalgae have the ability to degrade organic matter present in the water into small molecules which in turn used by them as nutrients for their growth 59 it has been observed the algae are capable to degrade the pollutants and transform them to intermediates or by enhancing the degradation potential of the microbial community present around the ability of microalgae to degrade harmful organic pollutants is documented for example microalgae had increased the biodegradation rate of caffeine up to 99 60 it was also reported that the n muscorum s platensis and a oryzae can biodegrade malathion and efficiencies were 91 54 and 65 respectively 61 it was also observed that the microalgae can biodegrade or biotransform organic pollutants via metabolic action by accumulating the pollutant and resultantly degrade it via transformation and mineralization 62 it was exhibited that naphthalene can be degraded into four significant metabolites trans naphthalene dihydrodiol cis naphthalene dihydrodiol 4 hydrox 4 tetralone and 1 naphthol by both eukaryotic microalgae and blue green algae these metabolites were produced at a non toxic concentration 63 aldaby and mawad reported that the degradation capacity of oscillatoria sp for py that was significantly surpassed than that of the chlorella sp under the same incubation condition and at 50 and 100 mg l concentration of py it was observed that the oscillatoria sp have ability to 95 py whereas chlorella sp has the ability to degrade 78 71 of py at 50 mg l concentration of py and 30 days of incubation time it was also observed that py at 10 and 30 mg l is completely degraded by both strains 64 4 environmental applications 4 1 co2 mitigation by microalgae climate change is caused by greenhouse gases and co2 is the major greenhouse gas that causes global warming and 68 of total emissions account for co2 according to the kyoto protocol the release of greenhouse gas should be reduced by 5 2 relative to the emissions in 1990 65 the co2 concentration in the atmosphere is not only the cause of global warming but also results in a 30 increase in the acidity of the ocean which in turn adversely affects biodiversity 66 67 since ghg affects human life as well as the global environment there is a need to provide solutions to fix this problem in the recent era many research and development projects have been executed to reduce co2 in this regard co2 is converted into hcs and organic carbon like lipids by a process known as the co2 fixation process 34 physical chemical and biological methods were some of the reported methods the biological method is trustworthy among all the methods in a biological approach microalgae are mostly used in co2 biofixation due to their high biomass productivity photosynthetic performance high lipid accumulation and valuable non fuel co products 68 the ability of microalgae to accumulate polyunsaturated fatty acid and lipid increases with the increase in the concentration of co2 in media which results in an increase in the yield of biodiesel by microalgae 69 70 moreover biodiesel produced by microalgae is exceptionally eco friendly and does not contain toxic materials or sulfur 71 co2 is accumulated in algal biomass and then converted into products such as renewable biofuels vitamins and proteins 72 animal and aquaculture feed products food and other beneficial products such as nutraceuticals cosmetics bio fertilizers and pharmaceuticals 73 it is believed that microalgae are 10 50 times more efficient than terrestrial plants because of their rapid growth simpler structure and ability to use carbon as a nutrient 5 73 74 microalgae can be cultivated by using co2 of flue gas from power plants or by using atmospheric co2 in the raceway pond 5 72 75 different microalgae species show a different level of tolerance to the co2 concentration of flue gas 34 microalgae are divided into three categories according to their capacity of co2 tolerance i co2 sensitive species inhibited by mere 2 5 co2 ii species that can tolerate 5 20 co2 co2 tolerant species iii species that can tolerate 20 100 co2 extreme co2 tolerant species 34 there are only limited species of microalgae that have shown remarkable tolerance to a high concentration of co2 e g arthrospira spp chlorella spp s dimorphus n oculate and b braunii however it was reported that scenedesmus spp exhibited more tolerance than chlorella spp in high concentrations of co2 i e 10 80 whereas both species have the ability to grow in low concentration of co2 i e 10 30 furthermore it was also observed that the growth of scenedesmus spp was inhibited in a 100 concentration of co2 but this inhibition effect can be reversed by returning the co2 concentration to 20 76 a mutant of chlorella spp strain kr 1 was also reported which has the ability to grow under as high as 70 co2 concentration 77 the co2 fixation rate by microalgae decreases with a low concentration of co2 and a high flow rate it was reported that when chlorella sp was grown in different co2 concentrations i e 1 75 and 9 45 as well as the different flow rate of co2 the maximum growth rate was shown by the chlorella sp i e 1 75 at 50 ml min flow rate of co2 this concentration of co2 also resulted in maximum biomass production high co2 concentration decreases the ph to less than 5 5 which in turn could prevent algae from growing a decrease in co2 supplementation decreased the concentration of biomass noticeably so the results indicated that the co2 fixation efficiency of microalgae might decrease at low concentration and high flow rate of co2 78 moreover it was observed that some species of microalgae could be cultivated by using 10 15 co2 69 but high levels of flue gas components like metals nox and sox and may cause cell growth to be inhibited in some microalgal species 79 recently the effect of the irregular wastes i e co2 so2 no and ash present in the flue gas of a coal power plant on the co2 biofixation growth parameters and biomass characterization of c fusca leb 111 was evaluated the addition of no and so2 up to 400 ppm did not affect the biofixation of co2 by microalga significantly the best efficiency to fix co2 by microalgae was shown at 200 ppm so2 and no 40 ppm ash and 10 co2 similarly 111 biomass composition of the c fusca leb remained the same in all trials 80 s dimorphus has the ability to tolerate high concentrations of no and co2 it was reported that intermittent sparging with flue gas and ph control plays an important role in overcoming the inhibition of microalgae by flue gas the maximum biomass concentration i e 3 63 g l and highest co2 biofixation of 75 61 was observed by intermittent sparging of flue gases 81 in a symbiotic relationship the microalgae showed higher tolerance a symbiotic c desmodesmus sp 3dp86e 1 from a white sea benthic hydroid d pumila showed tolerance to up to 20 co2 this high level of co2 did not affect the functioning and ultrastructure of the microalgae moreover the rate of growth of the culture had also increased by two folds however the amount of photosynthetic carbon to be assimilated along with the effective delivery of the photosynthates to biosynthesize the structural cell components is decisive for the efficient growth of microalgae at a higher concentration of co2 these abilities of the symbiotic microalgae make them appropriate to be used in the advanced technologies to mitigate co2 82 many other microalgae species have equally been reported for biomitigation of co2 table 1 4 2 bioremediation of domestic effluents inorganic chemicals such as nitrates and phosphate and organic compounds are the main pollutants in the domestic effluents so c p and n are the three main pollutants present in urban wastewaters 33 these pollutants cause eutrophication which in turn resulted in the depletion of oxygen in water 90 this is a global problem that can be resolved by using microalgae as the microalgae have the ability to use wastewater as feed for their growth microalgae during growth accumulate and remove the excess nutrients from wastewater a wide range of microalgae like spirulina scenedesmus chlamydomonas chlorella and botryococcus is used for bioremediation of the domestic wastewater 63 4 2 1 removal of inorganic nutrients detergents are the reason for approximately 50 of the total p in the domestic effluent whereas metabolic interconversion release of n the n and p are present in the form of ammonia nitrate nitrite and orthophosphate in wastewater the elimination process of these nutrients is recognized as nutrient desorbing 5 nitrites nitrates and ammonium are important nutrient sources for the microalgae 91 microalgae assimilate these nutrients into their cells for growth and play a role in the remediation of wastewater 5 whereas phosphates are used as intermediates in the metabolic activity of carbohydrate 91 microalgae remove n by assimilation and the phenomena to remove p are not understood yet two metabolic processes are under debate to describe the mechanism for p removal 1 assimilation of p by algae for their growth and 2 uptake and storage of p as polyphosphates in the algal biomass 92 microalgae can produce 100 t of biomass by using approximately 1 t of p and 5 t of n 93 in recent studies it is reported that the pure and mixed cultures of microalgae can remove inorganic nutrients including n and p in the range of 80 100 94 95 biomass production potential of 9 native microalgae consortia was evaluated in livestock wastewater having high strength as well as rural sector wastewater having low strength it was observed that all native consortia have the ability to reduce 80 100 nutrients from wastewater after 12 days of batch culture under controlled conditions 94 moreover the immobilized algae removed inorganic nutrients from effluents is alternative to harvesting microalgal biomass from suspended culture and considered as a cost effective method the co culture with activated sludge to alginate immobilized microalgae c vulgaris inoculum ratios r was examined for the removal performances for n and p and organic pollutants the highest performance was shown by the reactor having r 0 5 indicating 66 and 95 removal of n after 24 h and 84 h respectively the p was removed completely in the co culture system after 24 h whereas p was removed completely after 36 h in the pure c vulgaris culture 96 recently a prototype scale twin layer photobioreactor was designed using immobilized green alga h rubescens in vertical sheet like surfaces and employed for the treatment of municipal wastewater the results showed 70 99 of p and n was removed efficiently from 22 effluents depending on the type of wastewater and elements present in it 97 moreover the ability of microalgae to remove the p and n from the domestic wastewater was improved by adding microalgae to a sequencing batch biofilm reactor to form a unique algal bacterial symbiotic system results depicted that the algae assisted sequencing batch biofilm reactor increased removal efficiencies for the total p and n from 31 9 to 89 3 and from 38 5 to 65 8 respectively 98 4 2 2 removal of organic pollutant there is a high level of organic pollutants in domestic wastewater which are biodegradable 99 these organic pollutants when discharged result in the increase of the pollution load like cod bod and tss both chemical and biological methods are used to oxidize carbon atoms present in organic pollutants into co2 bod uses the capability of microorganisms to change organic pollutant into co2 and h2o in the presence of the oxidizing agent i e o2 the dissolved o2 of water can be depleted due to surplus bod leading to anaerobiosis and fish kills 40 thus organic pollutants result in the degradation of the water quality by depleting o2 which damage to the aquatic environment 99 microalgae have the ability to decrease the organic load besides mineral pollutants 33 moreover algae enhanced its efficiency for the removal of bod from domestic wastewater by making a symbiotic relationship with bacteria by providing o2 100 it was reported that the chlorella has the ability to reduce 75 of the organic substances from kitchen wastewater the efficiency of microalgae to remove cod from kitchen wastewater was also evaluated in the first four days cod decreased slowly in kww and then cod concentration was retained at the constant level and changed in a small range this happened because microalgae were unable to use some organic sources present in kww the ultimate removal efficiency of microalgae for cod was 32 14 in kww 101 the effectiveness of botryococcus sp to clean gw in phytoremediation treatment was also investigated the results indicated that botryococcus sp is effective in reducing 88 cod and 82 bod furthermore botryococcussp removed 83 cod 82 tic 68 bod at 50 concentration of gw 102 in another study it was concluded that the chlamydomonas sp scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp are able to remove 10 34 11 46 g bod m2 day and 14 3 15 33 g cod m2 day by using 300 mm using deep high rate algal pond 103 it was also observed that the cod removal was constant using spirogyra sp this might be due to the already low initial concentrations of cod in the wastewater or due to the sterile conditions in the reactors it was predicted that unsterilized wastewater causes higher cod removal 104 a number of microalgae species have been studied for wastewater treatment and a promising efficiency has been reported table 2 5 bioremediation of industrial effluent the one of main pollution sources of the environmental pollution are industries the type and level of pollutants released into the environment depend on the industry industrial wastewater includes process wastes from the manufacturing process sanitary waste washing during cooling and heating operations 117 the composition of wastewater is highly diverse as it depends on the sources and sites of the effluents 118 these industrial discharge include pesticides dioxins heavy metals poly aromatic hydrocarbons pahs polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs phenolic compounds petrochemicals and microorganisms 117 119 121 pollutants from industries release into water sheds and cause an increase in cod bod tss tds toxic metals such as pb cr cd and ni thus make the water inappropriate for irrigation drinking as well as aquatic life 117 these industrial effluents are the reason for long term consequences on the functioning of the ecosystem which involve changes in the availability of food and self regulating capacity of the biosphere 118 122 123 5 1 effluents from the textile industry effluents from the textile industry are considered as the main source of water pollution because of the worldwide increase in the textile industries and presence of diverse type of dyes in wastewaters 124 126 variable ph higher salinity cod high temperature and color are some of the characteristics of the textile wastewater 118 127 in the textile industry the desired quality and color of the fabric is obtained by using dyes and auxiliary chemicals 128 the use of synthetic dyes has been increased in the dyeing and textile industries because of their high stability to light resistant to microbial attack and temperature ease in use cost effectiveness in synthesis and diversity in color imparted by them in comparison to natural dyes 129 these dyes lost in the environment and cause problems as they have a fixation efficiency of 60 90 124 the water discharged from the dying process contain dyes heavy metals salts pigments inorganic and organic pollutants 130 131 this wastewater is the reason for pollution eutrophication change in transparency gas solubility and ph of water decrease in the dissolved oxygen do photosynthetic activity and increase in the cod the synthetic dyes are reluctant to biodegradation because of their aromatic structure and xenobiotic nature they reduce the light penetration in water and restrict the phenomena of photosynthesis thus affecting the flora and fauna 127 132 so it is necessary to treat these industrial effluents before discharging them into the environment 124 enzymatic and microbial degradation has gained considerable importance for the removal of dyes as it is a sludge free inexpensive and environmentally friendly process 133 micro algae is considered best to remediate the textile effluent by removing p c and n which in turn reduces the eutrophication 134 microalgae cultivated in textile wastewater uses nutrients and dyes present in it for its growth bioaccumulation and biosorption are the two processes for the bioremediation of the wastewater 127 135 136 in the bioconversion process dyes are consumed by microalgae as a source of carbon and converted into metabolites however in biosorbent process dyes get adsorbed on the surface of microalgae moreover these phenomena can also occur simultaneously for wastewater treatment of the textile industry 135 additionally both dead and living microalgae can be used in these phenomena however removal of dyes by the adsorption process can occur exclusively by using dead microalgae 127 131 the ability of algae to degrade dyes depends on the specie of algae being used and the structure of dyes sasikala and sudha 2014 studied the decolorization ability of different algal species separated from numerous sources the best ability to decolorize twelve different reactive and azo dyes were shown by gloeocapsa sp phormidium sp and aphanotheca sp aphanotheca sp was found to remove 83 of blue mezrl and 90 of orange m2r after 20 days moreover 69 of navy blue m3r and 59 of red acid crude after 10 days of incubation was removed only oscillatoria sp was able to remove orange me2rl which also did not show significant removal in the early incubation period 128 also aragaw et al 2018 used microalgae in a photobioreactor to treat the textile wastewater and microalgal bioreactor has the capacity to remove bod cod and tds by 91 90 91 50 and 89 10 respectively 128 biosorption of tww by microalgae was also carried out similar to bioconversion 131 it was observed that the powdered biomass of c vulgaris is an effective adsorbent for the removal of orange g dye it was observed that maximum biosorption capacity was 38 of c vulgaris 137 a consortium performed better than the single system for the simultaneous removal of nutrients and dyes a 98 09 decolorization of the dispersed red 3b rate was obtained by using consortium at optimized conditions the tp cod and ammonical n were removed up to 83 9 93 9 and 87 6 respectively 138 the immobilized algae also showed better efficiencies than suspended cultures in bioremediation applications a polysulfone nanofibrous web microalgae psu nfw was used for microalgae immobilized and same was applied for the removal of rb221 and rb5 dyes the microalgae psu nfw decolorize about 72 97 0 3 of rb5 whereas pristine psu nfw decolorizes 12 36 0 3 of rb5 for the rb221 solution the decolorization rates of pristine psu nfw and microalgae psu nfw were 5 51 0 4 and 30 2 0 23 respectively 139 table 3 5 2 effluents from tanneries in tannery the transformation of leather takes place it is one of the oldest industries in the world the raw materials and inputs used in this process are vulnerable to the environment 156 there are two methods which are used in for tanning i vegetable tanning ii chrome tanning 157 effluents having several chemical compounds are generated in leather processing during the wet finishing process these effluents contain chemical compounds such as fatliquoring oils neutralization salts retanning agents dyes surfactant polymers solvents resins pigments and other chemicals 4 generally wastewater of tanneries is brown has basic ph and a high concentration of organic substances that differ based on chemicals being used 158 dyes added in the last steps to give interior and surface coloration to leather are responsible for the generation of wastewater with a high concentration of dyes 159 moreover ammonium salts sulphates and chlorides are used during dehairing and deliming process that are responsible for pollution of water sheds 158 besides water from tanneries not only has a considerable amount of degradable organic waste like organic n and fats and proteins but also a major quantity of inorganic contaminants and toxic heavy metals particularly cr 6 sulphides chlorides with high bod and cod 156 158 160 a 90 of the water used in tanneries is released as effluent 161 these effluents are highly toxic and need to be treated by advanced methods before being discharged into the water sources 160 several studies have been reported the efficiency to utilize the microalgae to bioremediate the effluents from the tanneries a microalgal consortium was evaluated for the treatment of wastewater from a tannery three types of effluents i e effluent after primary treatment 50pe50w raw effluent 50re50w and effluent after primary and secondary biological treatment 50be50w were employed for microalgae growth the highest biomass concentration of 1 77 g l was presented by the 50pe50w after 16 days of cultivation it was observed that this microalgal consortium is able to remove 99 90 51 02 91 75 and 82 88 for n nh3 cod p po4 and tkn respectively from all types of effluents 160 also the effect of photoperiod on the efficiency of microalgae was studies including raw wastewater r and wastewater after secondary biological treatment were employed for microalgal growth in 24 h of photoperiod and 12 h of light constant aeration and 25 c of temperature the maximum biomass concentration of 1 40 g l for 75r25b effluent p removal of 97 94 for the 50r50b ammonia removal of 100 for both effluent and n removal of 71 53 for the 50r50b was obtained in the 24 h condition it was also observed that the metabolism of p and n present in wastewater and metabolic activities is directly linked to the production of biomass 162 it was also observed that the immobilized algal cells have more capacity to remove effluents from tannery wastewater than free cells jaysudha et al 163 reported that 99 39 of phosphate was removed by immobilized cells on the 8th day whereas algae free beads and free algal cells absorbed only 37 41 and 81 94 respectively likewise 98 71 of phosphate was also removed by immobilized cells on the 8th day whereas the free algal cells and without microalgal beads removed only 65 83 and 43 71 respectively finally 98 54 of ammonia was removed by immobilized cells on the 4th day of incubation when compared to free algal cells and algae free beads in 62 04 and 24 94 respectively 163 the phycoremediation integrated with the ozone process can be considered as a practicable treatment method for tannery effluent along with enhanced biomass production in this process a partially treated tannery effluent by ozonation was coupled with phycoremediation it was observed that this combination results in the maximum reduction in the concentration of pollutant with 84 reduction in cod 100 in odor 60 in color 82 n nh4 n 97 in chromium 90 in inorganic carbon 100 in po4 p and 10 in tds 164 table 4 5 3 effluents from pharmaceuticals industries wastes generated by the pharmaceutical industry during the process of drug production are known as pharmaceutical effluents the presence of persistent substances resulted in the inadequate treatment of effluents from the pharmaceutical industries 175 177 some of the characteristic pharmaceuticals in the wastewater of pharmaceutical include lipid regulators antibiotics antiepileptic psychiatric drugs anti inflammatories diuretics analgesics and β blockers each of which is present in the different composition in the effluent 175 178 179 these pharmaceutical active substances used in low doses produce specific biological effects on living organisms these pharmaceuticals prove to be toxic for the living organisms due to their ability to interact with living organisms after absorption 178 180 the industry is distinguished by the plant sizes a range of production processes as well as quality and quantity of wastewater in fact diversity of processes and operation in the pharmaceutical industry due to diversity in products makes it almost impossible to define the characteristic pharmaceutical effluent however it contains a high amount of bod cod and nitrate which put a hazard to both aquatic environment and humans when released to the environment without any treatment 175 pharmaceutical compounds are considered emerging environmental pollutants and are difficult to be removed by using conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps and transferred to groundwater and surface waters 181 bioadsorption photolysis bioaccumulation and biodegradation have been suggested as the main processes involved in the removal of micropollutants and these emerging organic pharmaceutical contaminants by microalgae 182 183 the use of microalgae is a sunlight driven sustainable and ecological retrieval strategy for the removal of pollutants pharmaceutical industry 183 recent studies had shown that c sorokiniana can remove the salicylic acid and paracetamol from an artificial medium 184 as well as numerous other micro pollutants from anaerobically digested black water and urine 185 however further use of algal biomass is limited because of the accumulation of contaminants in the algal biomass 183 some other algal strains used for the bioremediation of pharmaceutical effluents are listed in table 5 5 4 effluents from electroplating and mining industries electroplating is an electrochemical process used for the surface treatment of metal metals commonly used for coatings are ag cd ni cu au and similar metals 200 201 the solution of the metal which is usually in the form of chromic acid copper cyanide or cadmium oxide is placed in the plating baths 202 203 the effluents from electroplating industries are both alkaline and acidic high tds heavy metals like ni cr and cd etc are the characteristics of the acidic effluent whereas the alkaline effluent is produced during the coating of paint to wheels and contains heavy metals and calcium chloride 204 thus the effluents from electroplating and other metal processing industries have considerable amounts of toxic metal ions chromates cyanides alkalis and acids 118 202 such toxicity can pollute the nearby biotic and abiotic environment so these wastes need to be treated before their discharge into water sheds and their concentration does not exceed the maximum permissible which cause highly toxic effects to the living organisms beyond the permissible limits 200 205 206 the ability of heavy metal ions to bioaccumulate and biosorbed in aquatic food chains can pass these metal ions to humans causing major health problems 207 209 these are toxic to humans even at low concentrations for example the high toxicity of lead results in damage to the kidneys nervous system and disturbance in the metabolism of vitamin d especially in children nickel compounds are considered as carcinogenic 200 and long term contact with cd can cause bone mineral loss kidney damage reduced lung function and increased risk of bone fractures 118 cyanide is also a toxic specie that is commonly present in the industrial effluents produced by metallurgical operations it has a strong ability to bind with metals making it suitable for metal finishing and as a lixiviant for leaching metals especially gold 210 211 however exposure to cyanide induces negative health effects on humans and wildlife 211 the conventional methods of industrial wastewater treatment such as ion exchange precipitation and electrochemical methods 212 are not cost effective for the removal of metal ions on a large scale nowadays algae both micro and macro algae biomass is used as a non conventional means for the remediation of heavy metal ions 118 bioaccumulation of heavy metal ions by microorganisms normally occurs in two steps 213 the first step involves the inactive biosorption which occurs on the cell surface and is entirely independent of cellular metabolism the second step depends on cell metabolism and involves active sorption of heavy metal ions into the cytoplasm of algal cells 213 214 the sorption capability of the surface of an algae cell to a certain ion also depends on different factors such as the coordination number of the metal ion to be sorbed the number of functional groups on the surface of algae cells the availability of binding groups to metal ions the chemical state of these sites and the complex formation constants of these functional groups with a metal ion 118 the presence of different types of binding groups on the algal cell surface i e hydroxyl carboxyl phosphoryl amine sulphuryl imidazole sulfate phosphate carbohydrate thiol ether etc enhance the adsorption of metal ions 215 216 these binding groups are present at the cell surface as well as in the cytoplasm and particularly vacuoles 118 microalgae have the ability to form complexes of heavy metals and cellular proteins without altering their activity 216 these organometallic complexes are further moved insides vacuoles to regulate the concentration of heavy metal ions in the cytoplasm which results in the subsequent mitigation of their toxic effects 217 it was reported that the presence of sulfonic and carboxylic functional groups on the surface of the macro algae p canaliculata is the reason for the remediation of zn and cu ions from the aqueous solutions 218 similarly carboxyl hydroxyl amino and carbonyl groups present on the surface of freshwater algae anabaenaphaerica proved to have a major role in biosorption of pb and cd ions 219 however cyanide is degraded by several algal strains due to their ability to use it as a source of carbon and n for their growth 220 it was observed that a particular algal strain may show selective interaction with a particular heavy metal ion moreover the removal of heavy metal ions largely depends on the biomass concentration and initial concentration of metal ions 118 for example it was reported that the marine algae u fasciata and u lactuca have the ability to adsorb the cd at different culture conditions it was observed that the biosorption capacity of both microalgae increases by increasing ph from 3 to 8 and changing the temperature between 20 30 c the results demonstrated that the biosorption efficiency for cd increased with increasing concentration of u fasciata biosorbent and afterwards it decreased moreover the biosorption was decreased by increasing the concentration of cd in the case of u fasciata in the case of u lactuca biosorption efficiency was increased by increasing the concentration of cd from 20 to 30 mg l the results indicated that the maximum adsorption capacity shown by u fasciata is 8 353 mg g for cd whereas maximum adsorption capacity is shown by u lactuca 8 804 mg g for cd at optimum conditions 221 the dead biomass is considered preferable over the living biomass as there is no need for culture growth media in case of dead biomass these growth media in turn increase the bod and cod of the industrial wastewater moreover the dead biomass biosorbent is generally not influenced by the toxicity of heavy metals 222 the performance of the dead algal biomass can be enhanced by modifying it via activation methods bulgariu and its co worker activated the algal waste attained after extraction of oil by alkaline treatment and utilized it for the removal of cd in column and batch systems it was concluded that alkaline modification of the waste biomass of algae can be used to enhance the removal efficiency of the biosorbent as well as to remove the traces of organic solvents easily from the composition of biomass furthermore it was observed that cd removal by at awb has higher biosorption potential i e 41 88 mg g in a 10 min as compared to the untreated algal waste biomass which shows biosorption potential of 33 71 mg g in a contact time of 30 min it was concluded that the enhancement of the biosorption of waste algal biomass is associated with the increase in the accessibility of functional groups after alkaline treatment 223 the efficiency of the algal biomass can also be enhanced by immobilization the adsorption capacity of freely suspended and ca alginate immobilized c vulgaris cells was compared for the biosorption of fe ii zn ii and mn ii ions from the aqueous solution it was observed that the 43 43 mg g fe ii 40 98 mg g mn ii and 37 43 mg g of zn ii were absorbed by algal cells immobilized with ca alginate at optimum algal cells dose of 0 6 g l ph of 6 0 and contact time of 450 min at room temperature the biosorption effectiveness of freely suspended and immobilized c vulgaris cells to remove heavy metals from the industrial wastewater was authenticated it was concluded that the biosorption activity of the algal cells is enhanced by immobilizing the algal cells in alginate beads 224 efforts have been made to integrate the co2 mitigation wastewater treatment and bioenergy production processes in photobioreactors based on microalgae 102 in such a study the influence of co2 and organic matter om addition on the bioremediation potential of two microalgae s almeriensis and c vulgaris was evaluated it was concluded that the addition of co2 and om decrease the biosorption capacity of both microalgal species and it also inhibited the growth of c vulgaris 225 some other algal strains used for the bioremediation of effluents from electroplating and mining industries in different forms have been listed in the table 6 6 effluents from agricultural runoff the continuous increase in the world population has increased the demand for food which in turn has overburdened the agricultural system the desire to cultivate more food has resulted in the higher use of fertilizers and pesticides random use of agrochemicals has not only increased the production but also proved to be very dangerous to the environment as it has polluted the natural resources 235 mainly pesticides remain in the ecosystem because of their persistent nature of high solubility and cause harmful effects due to its toxicity they can cause acute harm to micro fauna and flora so disturbing the working of ecosystems 41 236 it was considered that the main cause of pollution in rural areas is agrochemicals from agricultural fields inorganic fertilizers which contain high quantities of n k p and organic carbon are applied regularly in fields in the harvesting season as well as in the pre harvest period together with herbicides and pesticides as a result these compounds which are highly soluble move easily into the soil thus agricultural runoff has a wide range of contaminants such as pesticides herbicides nutrients n p and heavy metals 237 pesticides residues also affects the beneficial organisms like spiders earth worms plants bees and cause natural decay besides polluting the environment including the soil 238 organochlorine pesticides are considered as the most problematic among the various pesticides used 239 in human pesticides cause symptoms like inflammation of the throat and nose itchy skin headache blisters on the skin rash vomiting tingling of the skin and eyes dizziness nausea diarrhoea a blurred vision even blindness and sometimes deaths normally in 24 h 41 algae may be utilized as biofertilizers or soil conditioners 240 the biodegradation of pesticides as well as treatment of other effluents from agricultural runoff by algae and cyanobacteria have been reported for example garcía galán evaluated the growth of the microalgae pediastrum sp scenedesmus sp chlorella sp and gloeothece sp cyanobacteria by using agricultural runoff as feedstock in semi closed hybrid tubular horizontal photobioreactor hth pbr in this study a 22 increase in biomass as well as complete removal of all nutrients were observed in 4 and 2 days respectively during the batch study 237 similarly the efficiency of pbrs which is a microalgae based technology was evaluated to remove nutrients from agricultural runoffs it was observed that the microalgae activity has a strong dependency on seasonal changes in solar radiation and temperature these seasonal changes led to an increase in ph values in the mixed liquor detected in summer and great changes in the production of biomass between seasons i e 43 g vss m3 d in summer to 7 g vss m3 d in winter it was inferred that the average n removal efficiency ranged from 50 in winter to 90 in summer the removal efficiency of p was greater than 95 in almost all cases 241 another study evaluates the growth of the microalgae n oculata in the presence of pesticide lindane and the ability of n oculata to remove it from the media n oculata removed 68 2 and 73 of lindane in the 0 5 and 0 1 mg l media concentrations respectively n oculata eradicated lindane from the media at concentration lower than 1 0 mg thus n oculata may be useful for lindane bioremediation in contaminated aquatic systems 59 another study was conducted to evaluate whether fungal assisted algal cultivation can also remediate the pesticides from contaminated water or not in this experiment c vulgaris microalga a niger the filamentous fungus and the biopellets formed by these microorganisms were investigated against 38 pesticides it was observed that treatment by biopellets significantly decreases the concentration of the 17 of these pesticides as compared to control however treatment with algae did not have any significant effect on the concentration of pesticides as compared to control further treatment by fungus lowers the concentration of pesticides by 59 6 2 0 g l and treatment by biopellets lowers the pesticide concentration by 56 1 2 8 g l as compared to the control which reduces the concentration of the pesticide by 66 6 1 0 g l thus biopellet formed by fungal assisted algal harvesting can also provide a possibility for the removal of organic pollutants from wastewater with a major role played by the fungus 242 it was suggested that the different microalgal species can tolerate a specific concentration of any particular pesticide the ability to withstand certain concentrations of specific pesticides varies among different species of microalgae when pesticides are present in a sublethal concentration microalgae not only have the ability to bioaccumulate the pesticides but can also biodegrade them however the metabolic pathway of the microalgal is considered as an area that needs to be explored to remediate the pesticides in future researches 34 esperanza et al 256 reported that the exposure of c reinhardtii to the sublethal concentration of atrazine for 3 and 24 h results in an alteration in a gene associated with catabolism of amino acid and respiratory cellular process it was recommended that photosynthesis was hindered and the algal cell was pushed to go for heterotrophic metabolism for their survival 242 in the same ways several studies were conducted to evaluate the removal efficiency of different kinds of microalgae for pesticides and other agricultural wastes table 7 findings revealed that bioremediation is a viable approach for the for treatment of effluents having different types of pollutants like dyes metal ions pharmaceutical agents inorganic and organic toxic pollutants 243 244 7 conclusions and prospects there are several methods to remove toxic contaminants and wastes from the environment however remediation from microalgal species is a cost effective and promising approach for the removal of contaminants it is present abundantly in nature and considered as one of the most suitable environment control methods they have diversity in their taxonomy structure and cope under harsh conditions it is deduced that different types of environmental pollutants can be remediated by using algal species certain microalgal species are used to remove specific pollutants by degradation and others remove the environmental pollutants by bioaccumulation and biotransformation it can reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide bioremediation of domestic effluents effluents from agricultural runoff and industrial effluents which may involve the effluents from the textile industry leather industry electroplating industry and pharmaceutical industry further wastewater is a rich source of inorganic and organic nutrients that are consumed by microalgae phycoremediation not only to improve the yields of biomass but also to produce other valuable products like lipids carbohydrates proteins and pigments the efficiency of the microalgae can also be enhanced by immobilizing the algal cells by utilizing binary cultures microalgae microalgae microalgae fungi microalgae bacteria associations or by pre treating the algal biomass to enhance the active sites moreover another benefit of cultivating the microalgae in the wastewater is the production of biodiesel and feed for animals the use of microalgae is an efficient and cost effective technique as compare to other conventional techniques for environmental remediation and production of valuables products declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13521,the current research aimed to develop a polymeric nanocpmposite membrane with a low cost nanoparticle for efficient oil water separation cellulose acetate ca polymer was used to synthesis membrane by phase inversion method and membrane property was influenced by the addition of functioalized silicon carbide sic nanoparticles the obtained results indicated that high water flux was achieved using the modified nanocomposite membranes which manifested improved attributes in terms of pore size hydrophilicity porosity and water content to know more about the membrane morphology and physicochemical properties field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem atomic force microscopy afm fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy thermal gravimetric analysis tga x ray powder diffraction xrd tensile test were utilized as characterization techniques the functionalised sic nanopacticle was also analysed by xrd ftir and fesem techniques the water contact angle of the pure ca membrane was 77 13 2 9 whereas it was as low as 58 6 4 2 after modification the modified membranes as such mirrored reasonably enhanced hydrophilicity besides reasonable improvement in the antifouling attributes of the membranes was also observed the pure water flux offered by the modified membranes in a microfiltration test unit was increased by 89 though there was no significant improvement in bsa rejection the competence of the modified membranes apropos of separation of toluene from its emulsion in water was adequately substantiated keywords functionalized silicon carbide cellulose acetate microfiltration membrane nanocomposite oil water separation flux recovery 1 introduction in recent years membrane technology has garnered significant attention due to its low energy consumption and good separation performance due to the progressive augmentation in its application in various industries including biochemical food and pharmaceutical sectors and based on unique wettable materials it is also promising for oil water emulsion separation the oil in water emulsion has a particle diameter of smaller than 20 μm which is frequently discharged from oil related industries such as textiles mining leather steel petrochemical and metal processing industries besides oil spillages leakages during oil production exploration transportation refining any accidents often result in the direct catastrophic emulsified oil discharge 1 various industrial problems including faulty pipelines and shipping accidents are also among the main reasons for the pollution of oceans rivers and seas by oil it further exacerbates environmental degradation and thereby poses a grave threat to both humans and marine ecosystems for sustainable development and to protect the environment it is crucial to purify the oily wastewater from different sources three different types of oily wastewater viz soluble oil emulsified oil and free oil are categorized as sources separation of emulsified oil from water has as such emerged as a global concern that mandates techno economically pragmatic solutions 2 3 therefore it is incredibly indispensable to deal with oily wastewater including different emulsions effectively among various polymeric materials cellulose acetate is widely used for membrane synthesis due to its distinctive characteristics like ease of process ability cost effectiveness easy film forming high flux non toxicity and biocompatibility 4 6 however ca membranes tend to get fouled due to concentration polarization cake layer formation at the membrane surface and causes congestion of membrane pores 7 additionally the membranes with ca polymer exhibit poor mechanicalstrength low chemical resistance low thermal stability sensitivity to cleaning agents greater compactionphenomena which sometimes leads to deteriorationin the desired separation and purification efficiency to overcome such deficiencies various methods namely surface coating 8 9 blending of polymers 10 grafting via gamma irradiation and plasma treatment 11 however the use of these processes sometimes causes deformation of the pore structure which in turn affects the tolerance limit of membrane consequently loss in permeate flux limits the membrane uses 12 researchers have reported the use of different inorganic nanoparticles transition metal and metal oxides blended with polymeric membrane materials like copper iron silver nickel alumina silica zirconia titania zinc oxide and zeolites modification of polymers by incorporating suitable nanoparticles ordinarily augments the attributes of 13 14 polymeric membranes given the excellent properties of both inorganic and organic materials i e thermal resistivity moderate mechanical strength exterior durability moderate separation and antifouling metal nanoparticles tend to agglomerate at higher concentration owing to their lower specific surface area and this causes pore deformation additionally toxicity of nanoparticles more often than not impedes their application in membrane synthesis 4 there are reports on the incorporation of several nanoparticles with high specific surface area including nanodiamonds 15 16 go 17 nanocarbon black 13 and carbon nanotube 18 into the membrane but these materials ordinarily have a few serious drawbacks which hinder their employment in membrane fabrication these disadvantages include high cost and complicated processing a few reports have also shown that different silicon si based material like silica sio2 19 20 mesoporous silica 21 poss 22 can be used in membranes as of now low cost sic nanopowder is the nanofiller of choice for reinforcing in composite materials and to be used as bio sensor gas sensor dielectric material optical material nanomedicine etc various purposes 23 24 it also possesses resistance to corrosion oxidation high durability low thermal expansion coefficient high thermal conductivity stability inertness to chemicals high specific surface area and biodegradability 25 26 on the other hand the amphiphilic nature of sic np causes hindrance in water uptake which in turn limits their use as membrane material 27 28 additionally to have a uniform dispersed nanoparticles into the polymer matrix is hard to achieve but this problem can be solved by modifying the surface of the nanoparticles introducing functional groups to the surface improves the interaction inorganic modifier and polymer in general hydrophilic functionalization of nanoparticle by various groups i e nh2 oh helps the membrane to form hydrogen bond with the water molecule which increases the water permeate flux and drives away hydrophobic foulant and results in better separation efficiency with improved fouling resistance 29 33 however the use of functionalized sic np for fabricating modified membranes has not yet been explored in this study we have reported an approach to prepare a membrane blending with functionalized sic nanoparticle and the cellulose acetate polymer 3c sic silicon carbide nanoparticle np size range 15 30 nm was functionalized by the most feasible way using apdems 3 aminopropyl diethoxy methylsilane before incorporating in cellulose acetate ca polymer for significantly enhancing the desirable properties and achieving an enhanced flux the modified nanocomposite membrane was studied by varying the concentration of the sic np as well as functionalized sic nh2 np and a comparative analysis was performed permeate flux rejection and flux recovery ratio of two casted membranes were investigated through filtration test in a cross flow filtration module set up using bsa protein as a model foulant the complex formation with organic molecule by attachment with the functionalized amine terminal molecule was also investigated by the rejection study furthermore rejection of oil toluene an organic solvent in water emulsion as model oily waste water was tested by a vaccum filtration set up 2 experimental work 2 1 materials silicon carbide sic beta phase 95 was obtained from alfa aesar 3 aminopropyl diethoxy methyl silane apdems 97 mw 191 34 g mol cellulose acetate ca mn 30 000 1 propanol and anhydrous toluene 98 were purchased from sigma aldrich germany and used as obtained 1 methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp solvent with 99 13 g mol molecular weight was procured from

potassium di hydrogen phosphate di potassium hydrogen phosphate anhydrous triton x 100 were obtained from merck life science pvt limited 2 2 preparation of amine functionalized sic np the impurities in sic np were removed by washing the sic nanoparticles consecutively using deionized water and absolute ethanol that served as a polar solvent the nanoparticles were subsequently separated by a centrifugal separator which operated at 12 000 rpm for 10 min the wet np was heated gradually in a muffle furnace at 10 c min up to 700 c in an oxygenated atmosphere and thereafter a constant temperature of 700 c was maintained for 1 h which transforms part of sic to sio2 0 1 gm of that obtained oxidized np sic sio2 was taken in a two necked round bottom flask and dispersed in 100 ml anhydrous toluene the contents of the flask were ultrasonicated for about 30 min to ensure proper dispersion of the nanoparticles then 0 4 ml 0 4 of overall solution medium of apdems was added drop wise to this homogeneous sic sio2 dispersion the mixture was vigorously stirred for 4 h at 60 c in an oil bath the flask was equipped with a condenser to reflux the vaporized toluene and n2 was purged by stop cock system to create an inert atmosphere the nh2 functionalized silicon carbide nanoparticles were separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation and the excess reactant was removed by washing the nanoparticles twice using anhydrous toluene and isopropanol consecutively the resulting np was dried at 60 c and stored in a desiccator for further application 2 3 preparation of solutions and membrane casting silicon carbide np 0 5 and 1 based on the total solution weight and functionalized nh2 silicon carbide np were added to nmp in a sealed glass bottle then the solution was ultrasonicated for 30 min to ensure good dispersion of particles after that 18 w w ca was added slowly to the mixture of nmp and np the solution was stirred for at least 4 h at 60 c to ensure complete dissolution of the polymer then those homogeneous solutions were degassed in an ultrasonic bath for 2 h and kept overnight for complete air bubble removal after that solution was poured carefully on a glass plate and cast by a casting knife adjusting the thickness at 250 μm after 30 s exposure to the air the fabricated membrane along with the glass plate was immersed in fresh distilled water to bring out the solvent for phase separation and complete removal of the solvent after a few minutes polymeric membranes with np filler were detached from the glass plate the amine functionalized silicon carbide embedded cellulose acetate membranes thus obtained were washed repeatedly and stored for further use in 1 wt sodium azide solution to prevent the microbial attack the ratios of the components in the membranes are summarized in table 1 2 4 characterization of functionalized np and membranes the surface morphology and structural changes of the np and membranes were examined by a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem sigma carl zeiss made in uk at an operating voltage of 30 kv with a resolution of 1 nm the membrane samples were frozen and subsequently fractured in liquid nitrogen the membranes were coated with platinum prior to fesem imaging analysis of the top surfaces and cross sections of the membrane samples thereafter the samples were mounted on aluminium pin by carbon tape with adhesive at both sides in a lateral position fourier transform infrared measurements ftir investigated the probable alterations in the chemical compositions and provided an insight into the overall chemical structures of nps and membranes in the present case the ftir analyses were conducted using perkin elmer ft ir c109292 spectrometer with wave number ranging from 4000 to 400 cm 1 for each sample 32 scans were taken with 4 cm 1 resolution in case of nanoparticle sample the experiments were run using pure kbr pallet as background and samples were prepared by mixing the nanoparticle with kbr and for membrane samples air was used as background the crystalline attributes of the membranes and as well as nps were examined by x ray powder diffraction xrd analysis in an x ray diffractometer system xpert pro equipped with cukα λ radiation in a diffraction angle 2θ range of 0 80 the mean surface roughness of the membranes was analyzed by atomic force microscopy afm where in each of the suitably tailored membrane samples having an area of 15 μm 15 μm scanned using tapping mode in air and the roughness parameter was was obtained using nanosurfeasyscan 2 software the thermal properties of the modified membranes were examined by thermogravimetric analysis tga perkin elmer sta 6000 the membrane samples were heated from 30 c to 800 c under highly pure nitrogen atmosphere and the rate of heating employed herein was 10 c min mechanical stability of the synthesized membrane was carried out at room temperature by measuring tensile strength and strain at maximum load using a universal testing machine with a crosshead speed of 2 mm min and a gauge length of 20 mm the samples undergoing mechanical testing were essentially 5 mm wide and 70 mm long rectangular specimens the tensile strength young s modulus and break elongation ratio of the membrane specimen were determined from the stress strain curve 2 5 wetting characteristics and mean pore radius the sessile drop 2 μl volume method was applied to measure the static contact angle of various membranes using a contact angle goniometer rame hart instrument co new jersey usa the average values of contact angle were reported after measuring it at six different locations of the membrane water adsorption capacity of synthesized membranes was estimated from the weight of dry and wet samples the wetted membrane was cut into small pieces 3 cm 3 cm and dried for 48 h by pressing between filter papers a highly precise weighing machine mettler toledo was used to measure the weight of samples the water content was calculated by 20 1 w a t e r c o n t e n t w 1 w 2 w 2 100 the porosity of the membrane can be determined by the ratio of the volumes of pores to the total volume of the membrane the overall porosity ε was calculated by using the dry wet method through the following equation 19 2 ε w 1 w 2 ρ w w 1 w 2 ρ w w 2 ρ p where w 1 and w 2 symbolize the weights of the wet and dry membrane gm respectively ρ w 0 997 g cm 3 is the density of deionized water and ρ p 1 30 g cm 3 is the density of pure ca polymerat 25 c for measuring the wetting characteristics four number of samples was taken from different portion of the membranes and subsequently average value was taken for results 2 6 filtration study among all the prepared membranes the pristine one m1 pure ca and the composite membrane with maximum nanoparticle loading m5 ca sic nh2 1 were compacted and analysed for their respective performances by way of pure water flux protein rejection studies fouling resistant ability besides the recycling potential of the nanocomposite membranes was using dead end microfiltration mf mf experiment 2 6 1 flux and separation study water and bsa permeation studies were performed in a dead end membrane mf module set up using the nanocomposite membranes the effective filtration area of each of the membranes was 44 18 cm2 and membranes were compacted at 3 9 bar for 1 h prior to the microfiltration experiments a stainless steel control valve was mounted on the retentate section for controlling the pressure monitored through a pressure gauge the retentate was continuously recycled back to the feed tank the flux values obtained at three different trans membrane pressures were recorded in each case the pressure was adjusted and a waiting time of 15 min was allowed for the flow to stabilize sprior to measuring the permeation flux the flux was calculated using this equation 19 3 j w q δ t a where jw is the pure water flux l m 2 h 1 q is the amount of permeates collected l δt is the sampling time h and a is the membrane area m2 for the microfiltration of protein 1gm l bsa solution was prepared using pbs solution ph 7 04 the variation in the permeation flux with pressure and time was gauged the bsa concentration in feed and permeate samples were analysed using a uv vis spectrophotometer at 280 nm with a standard protein calibration curve the rejection of bsa was checked by the following equation 19 4 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp is the concentration of bsa in permeate and cf is the concentration in feed solution a synthetic oily wastewater for oil water separation study was prepared with toluene and distilled water as v v 1 3 ratio this mixture was stabilized with triton x 100 surfactant and sonication at 50 hz for 4 h to get the emulsion as the membrane is tested as hydrophilic the water will pass through the membrane and the membrane will intercept the oil phase a membrane with an effective membrane surface area of 15 9 cm2 was used in a vacuum filtration set up for filtration purposes the toluene concentration in the feed and the permeate was tested by uv vis absorption method at 270 nm the percentage oil rejection value was calculated using eq 4 2 6 2 fouling resistant ability and recycling of membranes the antifouling characteristics of membranes were quantified for pure ca 1 wt amine functionalized sic embedded membrane following bsa separation the used membrane was washed with naoh solution and the pure water flux was measured to determine the dynamic fouling for the time study permeate flux was measured for 1 h with a 5 min interval at constant pressure of approx3 9 bar the flux recovery ratio frr was calculated to evaluate the fouling resistance of the membranes using the following equation 25 5 frr jw2 jw1 100 where jw2 and jw1 are the steady state water fluxes obtained from the at 2nd run and 1st run respectively the separation of bsa often results in concentration polarization and the accumulation of the bsa macromolecules in the vicinity of the membrane surface in advertently brings about pore blockage 20 the performances of the modified membrane and the pure ca membrane were compared by computing the flux losses induced by reversible and irreversible protein fouling as 20 6 rr jw2 jp jw1 100 7 rir jw1 jw2 jw1 100 where jp is the protein permeate flux the membrane fouling is an amalgamation of reversible and irreversible membrane fouling as such the extent of flux loss brought about by total fouling due to protein microfiltration was represented as and the overall membrane fouling that consists of reversible and irreversible causes the degree of flux loss thus for the bsa protein separation total protein fouling was defined as 8 rt rr rir 3 result discussion 3 1 characterisation of functionalized np a comparison of the respective ftir spectra of the as received sic np the intermediate sic sio2 and the final modified sic nh2 np fig 1 indicated the existence of hydrophilic amine nh2 functional group in the sic nh2 np given that the ftir spectrum of the amine functionalized np exhibited broad peak centred characteristically around 3500 cm 1 which could presumably be attributed the primary amine functional group by its stretching vibration of the nh bonds additionally the stretching vibration at 2829 assigned to ch2 bonds corresponding to apdems and the band at about 771 cm 1 was generated due to the nh stretch 22 between 1550 1640 cm 1 another peak was found due to nh bend vibration besides each of the three spectra was characterized by the presence of a broad peak between 780 950 cm 1 which was ascribed to sic stretching 26 the spectra at 1281 and 966 cm 1 corresponded to the sioc stretches and another absorption peak at 1595 was assigned to si o si stretching vibration as reported by x shang et al 2017 27 the effect of oxidation on sic nanoparticles was clearly indicated by the presence of a peak around 1000 1250 cm 1 which could be attributed to the asymmetric stretch of newly formed silica bridge si o si on silicon carbide surface 33 moreover the effective amino functionalization of sic nanoparticles was assessed by the appearance of a shoulder peak at 650 cm 1 which was associated with the wagging of hydrogen atoms in the nh2 molecular plane 34 the xrd analyses of all the samples are presented in fig 2 which represents the typical pattern of sic crystal in the case of the nanoparticle it was proven that the crystal structure was not altered by the functionalization process as there was no change in d spacing value so it implied that functionalization is a surface phenomenon which has no effect on the particles lattice structure 35 both the spectra is merged together as shown in fig 2 due to its highly common in nature after annealing at 700 c the sic sio2 peak was almost coincident with the pure sic peak and only a broad peak was observed covering 2θ values from 18 to 30 which confirmed the presence of amorphous silica and the effective oxidation of nanoparticles surface 26 31 moreover the shoulder peak located at the left side of the 111 peak was attributed to the stacking faults within sic and a new formed layer of sio2 32 the major peaks of the modified np were located at the same 2θ angle so no other phases were detected however the intensity slightly changed in 40 50 2θ region due to the presence of nh2 group the major peaks were observed at 35 739 41 504 60 144 71 971 75 716 and corresponded to the 111 002 022 113 and 222 planes respectively the xrd pattern thereby ascertained the presence of cubic sic 36 37 the principal moto for functionalization of nanoparticles is the transition of a hydrophobic non polar particle to a hydrophilic polar particle which results in its proper dispersion in water and in polar aprotic solvent like nmp n methyl 2 pyrrolidone the degree of alteration in the dispersion ability of the nanoparticles in the solvent depends on the changes engendered in the surface property of the procured np as such the present study attempted to functionalize the sic np to tailor the interfaces and transforming the wetting attribute for good dispersion of it in fig 3 the differences in the dispersion behaviour are shown aggregation of the unvarnished sic np post flocculation was observed and could be attributed to the high surface energy and hydrophobicity of the pristine sic np after annealing the particles albeit relatively stable and smooth still remained non dispersive owing to their unaltered hydrophobicity post amine functionalization the outstanding change in the nature of the nanoparticle occurred and the nanoparticles exhibited adequate stability and dispersed satisfactorily in the solvent after ultra sonication the observation further corroborated the successful incorporation of hydrophilic amine group into the particle surface which rendered the nanoparticles less prone to aggregation the surface morphology and the topographical difference between pristine and functionalized sic np were verified by fesem as shown in fig 4 the as received sic np was not well dispersed and the surface of the particle was rough compared to that of the modified one but in the case of the modified one the particles became more dispersive and smooth which implied that the surface hydrophilicity was greatly enhanced furthermore by sem analysis it clearly showed the effect of the amine nh2 groups on the extent of sic dispersion the as received sic np were agglomerated and cross linked with each other whereas the modified sic np were reorganized increasing in certain shape and size and particles became more regular and homogeneous in shape 19 3 2 characterisation of membranes 3 2 1 morphological characteristics the topographies of the membranes were significantly affected by the addition of functionalized and procured sic np the presence of np in the modified membranes was explored by comparing the morphologies of the pristine ca and modified ca membranes as inferred from their respective fesem images wherein the np loading corresponding to each of the modified membranes was 1 fig 5 a b and c indicated that each of the membranes was marked by a thin dense skin followed by a porous sub layer with the teardrop like macro voids 1 kx magnification was used to show the top surface of ca ca sic 1 0 and ca sic nh2 1 0 membrane fig 5 from the top surface analysis of the fesem images it can be seen that the amine functionalized nanoparticles incorporated ca membrane surface became more curving as the hydrophilic nanoparticles migrate from the membrane matrix to a water bath they could deform the membrane surface 20 the top surface of the membrane was nodulateduniformly 21 a typical fesem image mirroring the cross sectional morphology of a neat ca membrane ordinarily indicates a non porous structure which is a typical attribute of ca membrane as reported by many works of literature 14 the investigation of the images revealed that in the membranes the finger like macro voids along with the porous sub layer typically enhanced the membrane permeability the dense skin layer along with asymmetric microstructure operated as a selectively permeable barrier that indicates good selective separation 38 39 the alteration in skin layer and change in microscopic structure of the membranes are highly related to the hydrophilicity of the membrane material as the time of phase inversion the diffusion rate of water influence the coagulation rate of the nanopcmposite membrane and a kinetic instability took place so the fesem images indicated that the functionalized sic incorporated membrane was marked by an increase in pore size and a reduction in pore density as per the interfacial stresses between polymer and particles the de mixing process becomes more dominant and finally settled down by forming large pores in higher magnification of fesem it was also observable that in the dense sponge layer the presence of the np in both functionalized and raw sic incorporated membranes is significant the surface topography enhancement and the roughness parameter of the pure ca and composite membranes were derived from afm analysis fig 6 in the three dimensional surface images analysis the bright and dark areas corresponded to the peak and valleys respectively 9 the average roughness parameters ra were obtained from afm analysis and the values were compared for three different membranes fig 6 the surface roughness quantitative data manifested in table 2 indicated the highest surface roughness in case of the functionalized sic containing membrane the surface roughness parameters including the mean roughness sa the root mean square of the z data sq and the mean difference between the highest ridges and lowest rift sz were reported in table 2 the surface morphologies of the membranes were strongly influenced by the functionalized nanoparticles the roughness parameter values corresponding to the functionalized np incorporated membrane were appreciably high as compared to those corresponding to the neat ca and unvarnished sic contained membrane due to the active functionalities of the nh2 group the changes in the membrane structure and morphological improvement took place so it could be concluded that the upgradation in membrane surface area and active region brought about considerable augmentation in the membrane roughness in the case of nanocomposite membranes with functionalized sic content 33 40 41 the presence of nanoparticles accumulated the on surface increased the membrane roughness which in turn enhanced the hydrophilicity of the membrane thus reducing the adhesion energy between the surface and the organic pollutants and improving permeation and antifouling properties 16 membrane fouling decreased greatly following the increment in membrane roughness this claim was validated by further by investigating the antifouling performance of the membranes 3 2 2 chemical analysis ftir and xrd analysis was performed for understanding the chemical composition of the derived different membranes fig 7 a presents the ftir spectra of pristine ca ca with 1 unvarnished sic np and 1 functionalized sic np the characteristics band for ca as reported by various researchers was observed around 1750 cm 1 which corresponds to the co functional group 42 the prominent absorption band at 1303 cm 1 denoted the stretching for cc o c acetates as reported by j dasgupta et al in 2014 43 for the out of plane bending vibration of ch stretches a characteristic peak at 734 cm 1 was represented as the pure ca membrane is a nearly hydrophobic one so there might not be any presence of oh stretching during the range of 3000 4000 cm 1 and for any particular absorbance no spectra were found in this range in case of the nanocomposite membrane ca sic additional peak for various vibrational bonds of sic was found as previously shown for the sic np ftir analysis the same absorbance band was repeated in this case which highly implies that the strong binding between np and the polymer matrix in the spectra of ca sic nh2 1 wt membrane the new broad band near the 3200 3600 cm 1 emphasized the presence of oh stretching as being improved by the more water intake capacity due to increase in hydrophilicity though the peak value is little shifted from the position as it was in the ftir spectra of np due to the changes in chemical bonding for nanoparticle filler binding with the polymer matrix from the analysis of the reaction scheme as presented in fig 7 b we have proposed that the acetate group at the 6th position of the glucose unit of as received ca polymer is more accessible for the nh2 group of apdems because of less steric hindrance 44 46 the xrd pattern of pure ca membrane fig 8 revealed distinct peaks at 2θ values of 8 375 17 225 19 7601 and 22 475 which mirrored the purely amorphous polymeric nature of the pristine ca membrane in the case of nanocomposite membrane the additional peaks at 35 750 and 41 525 could be ascribed to the binding of sic np with the polymeric substrate the interlayer basal spacing and the angle of reflection were also modified due to the intercalation of sic np into the polymer chains the degree of particle dispersion could also be measured by estimating the distance between individual platelets in xrd 49 the peak locations showed a little shift presumably owing to the dispersion of nano sized sic np particles in the polymer matrices and the reasonable interaction between the np and the polymer matrix similar observations were reported by reza abedini et al 2011 30 3 2 3 tga tga was performed to examine further the response of pure ca and composites membranes at different temperatures as depicted in fig 9 after the loss of all the solvents present in the membrane each cellulose acetate membrane degraded rapidly in a single step nearly between 250 and 400 c and weight residue become 93 94 to 16 38 due to the polymer chain break down due to the higher thermal stability of sic nanoparticle the degradation temperature of the ca chain slightly increased presumably owing to the strong binding between the polymer and the nanoparticle 21 on the other hand the amine functionalized np embedded ca membrane in the second region comparatively showed degradation in lower temperature as seen by fesem analysis it was also visible that the membrane s nonporous sub layer structure is responsible for having strong resistance to heat flow than that of the porous m5 membrane the ca membrane showed better performance after adding sic np due to the strong heat resistant capacity while due to functionalizing slight degradation was observed due to hydrophilic interaction and for pure ca membrane it is observed that the nonporous spongy sub layer occupied more space than the pores so it degraded rapidly 31 another interesting study can be made by this observation that in the third step where carbonization and ash formation occurs which shows the main degradation step in that stage both types of nanoparticle incorporated membranes showed better performance comparing to the pure ca due to the increase in porosity the degradation of ca skeleton backbone is more rapid and for better distribution the binding between the np and the polymer the membrane become more susceptible to degrade and ash content generation is slightly more than that of pure ca membrane at about 590 c the wt residues of pure ca ca sic ca sic nh2 were 9 6 10 9 and 11 5 respectively which implied that the strong binding between the np and the polymer presumably hindered the leaching out of functionalized np the weight residue became slightly less for raw sic due to poor interaction and aggregation which anticipated the leaching out of raw unstable nanoparticles from the membrane matrix 43 as shown in fig 9 the sic nh2 nanomaterial incorporated hybrid ca membrane showed better performance than any other casted membrane the increment in the weight percentage residue of the m5 membrane than the pure membrane m1 strongly anticipated nanoparticles addition it also anticipated the strong binding between the membrane matrix and functionalized nanoparticles as the residue mostly contained inorganic particles after tga 43 3 3 wetting properties porosity and mean pore radius of different membranes the wettability of the membranes was evaluated based on water content porosity and wca measurement the hydrophilicity is the principal factors which influences membrane permeability as well the antifouling propensity 29 the porosity of all the composite membranes differed from each other significantly this could be explained as the addition of different types and amount of np into the polymer matrix lead to fluctuations in solvent and non solvent exchange degree at the time of phase inversion 22 the data in table 3 suggested that the increase in the sic content in the casting solution from 0 5 to 1 enhanced the extent of agglomeration of the nanoparticles presumably due to the hydrophobic nature of sic np thereby reducing the porosity of the membranes 16 on the other hand following the addition of the surface furnished np the porosity of the membranes increased outstandingly due to the hydrophilicity and the enhanced dispersion of the functionalized sic nh2 np in the ca matrix the increase in the porosity of the membranes could be attributed to the enhanced demixing rate at the time of phase inversion process along with the high mutual diffusivity of nmp and water these tendencies affect roughness and water flux as well the obtained values of the the water contact angle moreover serves as an index of membrane hydrophilicity the wca values in fig 10 suggested that the water contact angle of 1 modified sic content membrane was 58 6 which was the lowest among all the membranes this indicated that the membrane m5 manifested the maximum hydrophilicity among all the membranes under consideration in the present study also the hydrophilic group present in the membrane improved its hydrophilicity as the functional group of nanoparticle could partially inhibit the pore growth so in case of m4 and m5 pore size was reduced than the m2 and m3 as by the capillary flow analysis we can see the mean pore size decreased significantly upon addition of f sic nanoparticles table 3 though with comparison to m1 this functionalized sic incorporated membranes showed increment in pore size due to the hydrophilic functional group addition 3 4 tensile strength of the membranes the mechanical property of any membrane serves as an index of the ability of the membranes to withstand pressure driven stress during operation and maintenance as such the mechanical attributes determine the possibility of membrane service life enhancement thereby ascertaining its suitability for industrial usage in order to categorize the impact of interfacial interaction between the np and polymer matrix the tensile strength and break elongation were measured at the dry condition addition of any inorganic particles certainly improves mechanical properties because the inorganic particles strain can be uniformly dispersed within the matrix again the agglomeration propensity of nanoparticles due to relatively high surface tension certainly diminishes the breaking at the elongation point here comes the necessity of adding functional groups to the nanoparticles proper distribution into the membrane matrix but in this case for increasing hydrophilicity mobility in the polymer chain took place the polymer matrix expanded as polymeric chain movement became more rapid due to increment in the hydrophilicity 47 48 so for making the membrane viable to use in real life application it is essential to increase the hydrophilicity to such a limit that mechanical property must not be hazarded 12 the mechanical properties and thickness of different ca membranes were shown in table 4 as by adding 1 wt functionalized sic np porosity of the membranes increased that also elevate to decrase in reducing mechanical properties nevertheless these modified membrane could be still procured for the practical application for its mechanical properties by analyzing fig 11 we can depict that for functionalized np embedded polymer membrane become weak in tensile strength though it is evident that uniformity and proper dispersion were more for functionalized np embedded polymer the weak mechanical strength of m3 membrane probably due to the higher concentration of nascent nanoparticles which certainly forms agglomeration though m5 membrane could with stand the necessary operating stress but tensile strength reduced comparing to m1 membrane this observation owing that due to changes in chemical structure of pure ca polymer with the addition of amine functionalized sic which also causes the changes in pore formation and increment in porosity as proposed by other researchers this phenomenon could be attributed that this weakening in mechanical strength probably due to the changes in polymer structure and consecutively increment in porosity 39 50 as for both the case of upon addition of more nanoparticle sic sic nh2 might be due to the dilution effect of polymer solution which plays a crucial role due to the formation of porous supporting sublayer structure however the proclaimed functionalized np content membrane still may achieve the unavoidable mechanical requirement for microfiltration or ultrafiltration process 3 5 permeation study of the membranes two cast membranes were tested for water flux bsa flux and bsa protein rejection using a dead end flow membrane module apparatus the flux enhancement of a nanocomposite membrane mainly depends on surface hydrophilicity owing to the fact that the incorporated by incorporating hydrophilic nanomaterial water molecule can be drawn rapidly and by enhancing the pore size flux can be elevated 51 m5 membrane demonstrated a pore size of 0 10 μm and the porosity of the m5 membrane was 89 82 respectively as observed by fesem images as well from capillary flow analysis the water flux was increased for m5 membrane increased presumably owing to the significant increment in pore size and lower wca value fig 12 depicts the effect of amine functionalized sic on the pure water flux and bsa flux at different pressures moreover as the pressure increased the flux value increased significantly for all the cases as exhibited in fig 12 in the case of bsa flux m5 showed better results though the flux value did not increase significantly the bsa rejection using membranes m1 and m5 were explored at different pressures as shown in fig 13 the flux value was greatly enhanced for m5 due to the high hydrophilicity bigger pore size and porosity the bsa rejection by m5 value to be mentioned albeit lower than that obtained using m1 membrane value to be mentioned was nevertheless adequately high similar observations have been reported in literature 52 this interesting observation apparently contradicted the membrane porosity and pore size data nevertheless the obtained results could be accounted for by the fact that the amine group nh2 introduced into the membrane surface not only engendered a proper passage for water but also protected the membrane from bsa foulant the pure ca membrane also showed a positive effect in bsa rejection due to small pore size 39 in case of m5 membrane the functionalization with amine terminal apdems allowed for the attachment with biological molecules which presumably resulted in greater rejection 53 that attachment of bsa with any surface offers the combination of 3 types of interaction this binding force is enhanced for the amine functionalized nanoparticle with any organic molecule into the membrane matrix it can include hydrophobic interaction by weak van dar walls hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interaction 16 in our case compared to the hydrophobic interaction electrostatic interaction showed much influence as negatively charged bsa protein dissociated in the pbs solution could offer attachment with the nh2 group hypothetically present on the polymer matrix 54 55 thus the rejection of bsa protein by the synthesized modified membrane was quite impressive the bsa rejection achieved using m5 moreover demonstrated only a marginal increase following the increment of pressure from the graph it is evident that for m5 membrane the increased porosity and pore size led to reasonably good flux but the rejection was not also compromised the overall experimental protocol for the oil water separation study is shown in fig 14 oil water emulsion separation experiment was performed by a vacuum filtration unit as shown in fig 14 a the separation study was performed using pure ca membrane 1 sic and 1 sic nh2 contained membrane compared with the emulsion before separation the filtrate was transparent without any contaminant and was markedly devoid of any oil droplets while the original emulsion was pure dense white shown in fig 14 b so the oil was completely retained by the separation membranes additionally the respective separation efficiencies of the membranes were also calculated due to the appreciable hydrophilicity and good pore size the performance of the membranes apropos of toluene water emulsion treatment was adequately significant the surfactant stabilized oil in water treatment is much more difficult than the separation of immiscible oil from water the percentage of oil rejection using the three of the membranes is shown in fig 14 c from the results it is evident that the oil rejection using pure ca membrane m5 ca sic nh2 membrane and raw sic loaded ca membrane were 77 30 94 86 and 53 respectively the hydrophilicity of membranes is the theoretical basis for separating oil water mixture regardless of the extent of emulsification 2 the water molecules from the emulsion were attracted and diffused through the hydrophilic m5 membrane surface by solution diffusion mechanism and passed through the porous membranes due to capillary action retaining the oil particles 56 hence the functionalized sic blended ca membrane enhanced the separation of oil from oil water emulsions and the results thereby affirmed that the efficiency of the membranes with regard to oil contaminated wastewater treatment the surfactant stabilized oil in water emulsion solution was prepared with 1 3 ration of toluene and water the images of the feed and filtrates treated by m5 membrane are manifested in fig 14 c if we examine the mechanism of oil water separation by the pure ca membrane due to the higher water contact angle of this membrane oil particle was permeated through this and as emulsion was there some water molecule was also permeated though the efficiency was achieved by 77 30 for its very small pore size but in the case of raw sic blended membrane the mechanism of separation is different as pore size increase much so rejection efficiency compromised and for the most modified m5 membrane though the flux value was increased separation efficiency was not at all compromised for its pore size and water contact angle attribution considering the obtained from this separation study the conclusion was consistent with the results generated by way of the fesem analysis the pore flow analysis and the water contact angle study too though bsa rejection had been compromised 3 using the m5 membrane than the m1 membrane the rejection was not much lower compared to the reported study 57 this decrement in rejection was observed due to an increment in pore size from 0 03 μm for pure ca m1 to 0 10 μm for modified functionalized nanoparticles incorporated membranes m5 the mechanism for bsa and oil water separation study was different for the bsa rejection due to the smaller pore size of the m1 membrane it performed better than the m5 membrane whereas in the case of oil water separation it performed better due to the lower hydrophilicity of the m5 membrane the water passed through the membrane retaining the toluene from the emulsion by the solution diffusion mechanism moreover toluene is not readily soluble in water than the bsa molecule bsa solution protein molecules are highly soluble in water for hydrogen bonding and could easily pass through the microfiltration membrane and for toluene water emulsion due to weak van der waals s force it is not readily soluble and less energy is required to break down the emulsion for the improved hydrophilicity of the m5 membrane water can pass through easily by retaining the toluene from the emulsion additionally the typical droplet size of the dispersed oil in water emulsion of the toluene ranges from 0 5 to 5 0 μm 58 59 this anticipated successful rejection of toluene by the synthesized m5 membrane as tested pore sizes by capillary flow analysis are 0 10 μm smaller than the emulsion size range though the membranes hydrophilicity was the more dominant factor for the oil rejection than the size exclusion mechanism the authors performed this exciting observation that the membrane could get optimally used for oil water separation purposes for its trade off relationship between water contact angle and pore size parameters basically for the high water affinity by m5 membrane toluene rejection was higher 3 6 antifouling performance of the membrane membrane fouling is a significant factor affecting the technological viability of the polymeric membrane in terms of practical application by the simple hydraulic cleaning reversible fouling gel or cake layer can be removed as it is ordinarily caused by loose deposition of foulant on the membrane surface 16 the time dependent flux study involving cyclic filtration wherein bsa was the model protein foulant was carried out using all the membrane to determine their respective degrees of endurance against fouling and the results affirmed the competence of the functionalized sic content membrane apropos of water treatment from the fig 15 we can observe the maximum pure water flux of m1 was about 2800 l m2 hr during the 1st run the pure water flux of the modified membrane increased significantly as compared to unmodified m1 one for both the membranes the flux obtained by way of protein microfiltration dropped dramatically as compared to the original pure water flux in the first 10 min of protein microfiltration before stabilizing following the attainment of equilibrium under stirred condition between the deposition of bsa macromolecules on the membrane surface and the dislodgement of bsa molecules from the membrane surface a steady flux was achieved in each case beyond the abrupt drop in the first stage 20 following the flux study the antifouling property manifested by the m5 could be ascribed to its hydrophilicity hence the adsorption of protein molecules was only onto the membrane surface and not onto the pore walls of the membrane in case of m5 but in case of pure ca membrane for the absence of amine group the bsa protein came through the pore channel 16 in case of the modified m5 membrane the bsa protein may also come to the pore channeling but attached irreversibly due to the functionalized nanoparticle and polar organic molecule interaction so the irreversible protein fouling was 14 63 for m5 membrane whereas for m1 membrane it was 39 28 thus the f sic incorporated membrane manifested fairly superior antifouling attribute as compared to the pure ca membrane from the table 5 it can also be elucidated that the flux recovery ratio frr for m5 membrane was greater than m1 for the presence of amine group the fesem image of m5 membrane exhibited significant enhancement in number of pores and thereby substantial increase in the permeability of the nanocomposite membrane by the bsa flux analysis we can see that them5 membrane flux was more with time than the flux ofm1 and also in case of m5 as time increased the flux value reached a steady state value but in case of the m1 the flux declined with the increase in time following the inclusion of the nh2 group in the membrane matrix the lone pair of electrons on the n atom increased the affinity of the membrane for water molecules by way of hydrogen bond formation and thereby improved the wettability of the modified membrane so the bsa molecules did not foul the membrane but in case of pure ca the membrane got easily fouled and after washing for m5 the water flux traced an increasing trajectory again and reached a level nearly as high as the original value but for m1 the flux recovery after membrane washing was not adequate and the water flux after washing not reached so much as of the 1st run the fabricated membranes as such manifested improved antifouling attributes 4 conclusion the cellulose acetate nanocomposite membranes were synthesized using the phase inversion technique the modified membranes performance was investigated to see the effect of amine nh2 functionalized sic filler material the difference between weight residue by tga analysis of pure ca membrane and ca sic nh2 indicates that functionalized nanoparticles into the membrane matrix cause the increment in weight percentage residue the flux recovery ratio frr achieved using the modified membrane was 85 36 while that obtained using the pure one was 60 71 94 86 retention of toluene was acquired from the oil water emulsion therefore the results affirmed that the modified membranes given their easy fabrication and improved attributes could be applied by industries as an environmentally benign and cost competitive technique to bring about the separation of oil from oil contaminated industrial wastewater the results also revealed that the silicon carbide nanoparticles could enhance the membrane properties the slight heterogeneity in nanocomposite membrane was mostly induced by partial agglomeration of sic and sic nh2 np s or the casting solution s re stacking further work is required to know the specific correlation among the

13521,the current research aimed to develop a polymeric nanocpmposite membrane with a low cost nanoparticle for efficient oil water separation cellulose acetate ca polymer was used to synthesis membrane by phase inversion method and membrane property was influenced by the addition of functioalized silicon carbide sic nanoparticles the obtained results indicated that high water flux was achieved using the modified nanocomposite membranes which manifested improved attributes in terms of pore size hydrophilicity porosity and water content to know more about the membrane morphology and physicochemical properties field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem atomic force microscopy afm fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy thermal gravimetric analysis tga x ray powder diffraction xrd tensile test were utilized as characterization techniques the functionalised sic nanopacticle was also analysed by xrd ftir and fesem techniques the water contact angle of the pure ca membrane was 77 13 2 9 whereas it was as low as 58 6 4 2 after modification the modified membranes as such mirrored reasonably enhanced hydrophilicity besides reasonable improvement in the antifouling attributes of the membranes was also observed the pure water flux offered by the modified membranes in a microfiltration test unit was increased by 89 though there was no significant improvement in bsa rejection the competence of the modified membranes apropos of separation of toluene from its emulsion in water was adequately substantiated keywords functionalized silicon carbide cellulose acetate microfiltration membrane nanocomposite oil water separation flux recovery 1 introduction in recent years membrane technology has garnered significant attention due to its low energy consumption and good separation performance due to the progressive augmentation in its application in various industries including biochemical food and pharmaceutical sectors and based on unique wettable materials it is also promising for oil water emulsion separation the oil in water emulsion has a particle diameter of smaller than 20 μm which is frequently discharged from oil related industries such as textiles mining leather steel petrochemical and metal processing industries besides oil spillages leakages during oil production exploration transportation refining any accidents often result in the direct catastrophic emulsified oil discharge 1 various industrial problems including faulty pipelines and shipping accidents are also among the main reasons for the pollution of oceans rivers and seas by oil it further exacerbates environmental degradation and thereby poses a grave threat to both humans and marine ecosystems for sustainable development and to protect the environment it is crucial to purify the oily wastewater from different sources three different types of oily wastewater viz soluble oil emulsified oil and free oil are categorized as sources separation of emulsified oil from water has as such emerged as a global concern that mandates techno economically pragmatic solutions 2 3 therefore it is incredibly indispensable to deal with oily wastewater including different emulsions effectively among various polymeric materials cellulose acetate is widely used for membrane synthesis due to its distinctive characteristics like ease of process ability cost effectiveness easy film forming high flux non toxicity and biocompatibility 4 6 however ca membranes tend to get fouled due to concentration polarization cake layer formation at the membrane surface and causes congestion of membrane pores 7 additionally the membranes with ca polymer exhibit poor mechanicalstrength low chemical resistance low thermal stability sensitivity to cleaning agents greater compactionphenomena which sometimes leads to deteriorationin the desired separation and purification efficiency to overcome such deficiencies various methods namely surface coating 8 9 blending of polymers 10 grafting via gamma irradiation and plasma treatment 11 however the use of these processes sometimes causes deformation of the pore structure which in turn affects the tolerance limit of membrane consequently loss in permeate flux limits the membrane uses 12 researchers have reported the use of different inorganic nanoparticles transition metal and metal oxides blended with polymeric membrane materials like copper iron silver nickel alumina silica zirconia titania zinc oxide and zeolites modification of polymers by incorporating suitable nanoparticles ordinarily augments the attributes of 13 14 polymeric membranes given the excellent properties of both inorganic and organic materials i e thermal resistivity moderate mechanical strength exterior durability moderate separation and antifouling metal nanoparticles tend to agglomerate at higher concentration owing to their lower specific surface area and this causes pore deformation additionally toxicity of nanoparticles more often than not impedes their application in membrane synthesis 4 there are reports on the incorporation of several nanoparticles with high specific surface area including nanodiamonds 15 16 go 17 nanocarbon black 13 and carbon nanotube 18 into the membrane but these materials ordinarily have a few serious drawbacks which hinder their employment in membrane fabrication these disadvantages include high cost and complicated processing a few reports have also shown that different silicon si based material like silica sio2 19 20 mesoporous silica 21 poss 22 can be used in membranes as of now low cost sic nanopowder is the nanofiller of choice for reinforcing in composite materials and to be used as bio sensor gas sensor dielectric material optical material nanomedicine etc various purposes 23 24 it also possesses resistance to corrosion oxidation high durability low thermal expansion coefficient high thermal conductivity stability inertness to chemicals high specific surface area and biodegradability 25 26 on the other hand the amphiphilic nature of sic np causes hindrance in water uptake which in turn limits their use as membrane material 27 28 additionally to have a uniform dispersed nanoparticles into the polymer matrix is hard to achieve but this problem can be solved by modifying the surface of the nanoparticles introducing functional groups to the surface improves the interaction inorganic modifier and polymer in general hydrophilic functionalization of nanoparticle by various groups i e nh2 oh helps the membrane to form hydrogen bond with the water molecule which increases the water permeate flux and drives away hydrophobic foulant and results in better separation efficiency with improved fouling resistance 29 33 however the use of functionalized sic np for fabricating modified membranes has not yet been explored in this study we have reported an approach to prepare a membrane blending with functionalized sic nanoparticle and the cellulose acetate polymer 3c sic silicon carbide nanoparticle np size range 15 30 nm was functionalized by the most feasible way using apdems 3 aminopropyl diethoxy methylsilane before incorporating in cellulose acetate ca polymer for significantly enhancing the desirable properties and achieving an enhanced flux the modified nanocomposite membrane was studied by varying the concentration of the sic np as well as functionalized sic nh2 np and a comparative analysis was performed permeate flux rejection and flux recovery ratio of two casted membranes were investigated through filtration test in a cross flow filtration module set up using bsa protein as a model foulant the complex formation with organic molecule by attachment with the functionalized amine terminal molecule was also investigated by the rejection study furthermore rejection of oil toluene an organic solvent in water emulsion as model oily waste water was tested by a vaccum filtration set up 2 experimental work 2 1 materials silicon carbide sic beta phase 95 was obtained from alfa aesar 3 aminopropyl diethoxy methyl silane apdems 97 mw 191 34 g mol cellulose acetate ca

in sic np were removed by washing the sic nanoparticles consecutively using deionized water and absolute ethanol that served as a polar solvent the nanoparticles were subsequently separated by a centrifugal separator which operated at 12 000 rpm for 10 min the wet np was heated gradually in a muffle furnace at 10 c min up to 700 c in an oxygenated atmosphere and thereafter a constant temperature of 700 c was maintained for 1 h which transforms part of sic to sio2 0 1 gm of that obtained oxidized np sic sio2 was taken in a two necked round bottom flask and dispersed in 100 ml anhydrous toluene the contents of the flask were ultrasonicated for about 30 min to ensure proper dispersion of the nanoparticles then 0 4 ml 0 4 of overall solution medium of apdems was added drop wise to this homogeneous sic sio2 dispersion the mixture was vigorously stirred for 4 h at 60 c in an oil bath the flask was equipped with a condenser to reflux the vaporized toluene and n2 was purged by stop cock system to create an inert atmosphere the nh2 functionalized silicon carbide nanoparticles were separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation and the excess reactant was removed by washing the nanoparticles twice using anhydrous toluene and isopropanol consecutively the resulting np was dried at 60 c and stored in a desiccator for further application 2 3 preparation of solutions and membrane casting silicon carbide np 0 5 and 1 based on the total solution weight and functionalized nh2 silicon carbide np were added to nmp in a sealed glass bottle then the solution was ultrasonicated for 30 min to ensure good dispersion of particles after that 18 w w ca was added slowly to the mixture of nmp and np the solution was stirred for at least 4 h at 60 c to ensure complete dissolution of the polymer then those homogeneous solutions were degassed in an ultrasonic bath for 2 h and kept overnight for complete air bubble removal after that solution was poured carefully on a glass plate and cast by a casting knife adjusting the thickness at 250 μm after 30 s exposure to the air the fabricated membrane along with the glass plate was immersed in fresh distilled water to bring out the solvent for phase separation and complete removal of the solvent after a few minutes polymeric membranes with np filler were detached from the glass plate the amine functionalized silicon carbide embedded cellulose acetate membranes thus obtained were washed repeatedly and stored for further use in 1 wt sodium azide solution to prevent the microbial attack the ratios of the components in the membranes are summarized in table 1 2 4 characterization of functionalized np and membranes the surface morphology and structural changes of the np and membranes were examined by a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem sigma carl zeiss made in uk at an operating voltage of 30 kv with a resolution of 1 nm the membrane samples were frozen and subsequently fractured in liquid nitrogen the membranes were coated with platinum prior to fesem imaging analysis of the top surfaces and cross sections of the membrane samples thereafter the samples were mounted on aluminium pin by carbon tape with adhesive at both sides in a lateral position fourier transform infrared measurements ftir investigated the probable alterations in the chemical compositions and provided an insight into the overall chemical structures of nps and membranes in the present case the ftir analyses were conducted using perkin elmer ft ir c109292 spectrometer with wave number ranging from 4000 to 400 cm 1 for each sample 32 scans were taken with 4 cm 1 resolution in case of nanoparticle sample the experiments were run using pure kbr pallet as background and samples were prepared by mixing the nanoparticle with kbr and for membrane samples air was used as background the crystalline attributes of the membranes and as well as nps were examined by x ray powder diffraction xrd analysis in an x ray diffractometer system xpert pro equipped with cukα λ radiation in a diffraction angle 2θ range of 0 80 the mean surface roughness of the membranes was analyzed by atomic force microscopy afm where in each of the suitably tailored membrane samples having an area of 15 μm 15 μm scanned using tapping mode in air and the roughness parameter was was obtained using nanosurfeasyscan 2 software the thermal properties of the modified membranes were examined by thermogravimetric analysis tga perkin elmer sta 6000 the membrane samples were heated from 30 c to 800 c under highly pure nitrogen atmosphere and the rate of heating employed herein was 10 c min mechanical stability of the synthesized membrane was carried out at room temperature by measuring tensile strength and strain at maximum load using a universal testing machine with a crosshead speed of 2 mm min and a gauge length of 20 mm the samples undergoing mechanical testing were essentially 5 mm wide and 70 mm long rectangular specimens the tensile strength young s modulus and break elongation ratio of the membrane specimen were determined from the stress strain curve 2 5 wetting characteristics and mean pore radius the sessile drop 2 μl volume method was applied to measure the static contact angle of various membranes using a contact angle goniometer rame hart instrument co new jersey usa the average values of contact angle were reported after measuring it at six different locations of the membrane water adsorption capacity of synthesized membranes was estimated from the weight of dry and wet samples the wetted membrane was cut into small pieces 3 cm 3 cm and dried for 48 h by pressing between filter papers a highly precise weighing machine mettler toledo was used to measure the weight of samples the water content was calculated by 20 1 w a t e r c o n t e n t w 1 w 2 w 2 100 the porosity of the membrane can be determined by the ratio of the volumes of pores to the total volume of the membrane the overall porosity ε was calculated by using the dry wet method through the following equation 19 2 ε w 1 w 2 ρ w w 1 w 2 ρ w w 2 ρ p where w 1 and w 2 symbolize the weights of the wet and dry membrane gm respectively ρ w 0 997 g cm 3 is the density of deionized water and ρ p 1 30 g cm 3 is the density of pure ca polymerat 25 c for measuring the wetting characteristics four number of samples was taken from different portion of the membranes and subsequently average value was taken for results 2 6 filtration study among all the prepared membranes the pristine one m1 pure ca and the composite membrane with maximum nanoparticle loading m5 ca sic nh2 1 were compacted and analysed for their respective performances by way of pure water flux protein rejection studies fouling resistant ability besides the recycling potential of the nanocomposite membranes was using dead end microfiltration mf mf experiment 2 6 1 flux and separation study water and bsa permeation studies were performed in a dead end membrane mf module set up using the nanocomposite membranes the effective filtration area of each of the membranes was 44 18 cm2 and membranes were compacted at 3 9 bar for 1 h prior to the microfiltration experiments a stainless steel control valve was mounted on the retentate section for controlling the pressure monitored through a pressure gauge the retentate was continuously recycled back to the feed tank the flux values obtained at three different trans membrane pressures were recorded in each case the pressure was adjusted and a waiting time of 15 min was allowed for the flow to stabilize sprior to measuring the permeation flux the flux was calculated using this equation 19 3 j w q δ t a where jw is the pure water flux l m 2 h 1 q is the amount of permeates collected l δt is the sampling time h and a is the membrane area m2 for the microfiltration of protein 1gm l bsa solution was prepared using pbs solution ph 7 04 the variation in the permeation flux with pressure and time was gauged the bsa concentration in feed and permeate samples were analysed using a uv vis spectrophotometer at 280 nm with a standard protein calibration curve the rejection of bsa was checked by the following equation 19 4 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp is the concentration of bsa in permeate and cf is the concentration in feed solution a synthetic oily wastewater for oil water separation study was prepared with toluene and distilled water as v v 1 3 ratio this mixture was stabilized with triton x 100 surfactant and sonication at 50 hz for 4 h to get the emulsion as the membrane is tested as hydrophilic the water will pass through the membrane and the membrane will intercept the oil phase a membrane with an effective membrane surface area of 15 9 cm2 was used in a vacuum filtration set up for filtration purposes the toluene concentration in the feed and the permeate was tested by uv vis absorption method at 270 nm the percentage oil rejection value was calculated using eq 4 2 6 2 fouling resistant ability and recycling of membranes the antifouling characteristics of membranes were quantified for pure ca 1 wt amine functionalized sic embedded membrane following bsa separation the used membrane was washed with naoh solution and the pure water flux was measured to determine the dynamic fouling for the time study permeate flux was measured for 1 h with a 5 min interval at constant pressure of approx3 9 bar the flux recovery ratio frr was calculated to evaluate the fouling resistance of the membranes using the following equation 25 5 frr jw2 jw1 100 where jw2 and jw1 are the steady state water fluxes obtained from the at 2nd run and 1st run respectively the separation of bsa often results in concentration polarization and the accumulation of the bsa macromolecules in the vicinity of the membrane surface in advertently brings about pore blockage 20 the performances of the modified membrane and the pure ca membrane were compared by computing the flux losses induced by reversible and irreversible protein fouling as 20 6 rr jw2 jp jw1 100 7 rir jw1 jw2 jw1 100 where jp is the protein permeate flux the membrane fouling is an amalgamation of reversible and irreversible membrane fouling as such the extent of flux loss brought about by total fouling due to protein microfiltration was represented as and the overall membrane fouling that consists of reversible and irreversible causes the degree of flux loss thus for the bsa protein separation total protein fouling was defined as 8 rt rr rir 3 result discussion 3 1 characterisation of functionalized np a comparison of the respective ftir spectra of the as received sic np the intermediate sic sio2 and the final modified sic nh2 np fig 1 indicated the existence of hydrophilic amine nh2 functional group in the sic nh2 np given that the ftir spectrum of the amine functionalized np exhibited broad peak centred characteristically around 3500 cm 1 which could presumably be attributed the primary amine functional group by its stretching vibration of the nh bonds additionally the stretching vibration at 2829 assigned to ch2 bonds corresponding to apdems and the band at about 771 cm 1 was generated due to the nh stretch 22 between 1550 1640 cm 1 another peak was found due to nh bend vibration besides each of the three spectra was characterized by the presence of a broad peak between 780 950 cm 1 which was ascribed to sic stretching 26 the spectra at 1281 and 966 cm 1 corresponded to the sioc stretches and another absorption peak at 1595 was assigned to si o si stretching vibration as reported by x shang et al 2017 27 the effect of oxidation on sic nanoparticles was clearly indicated by the presence of a peak around 1000 1250 cm 1 which could be attributed to the asymmetric stretch of newly formed silica bridge si o si on silicon carbide surface 33 moreover the effective amino functionalization of sic nanoparticles was assessed by the appearance of a shoulder peak at 650 cm 1 which was associated with the wagging of hydrogen atoms in the nh2 molecular plane 34 the xrd analyses of all the samples are presented in fig 2 which represents the typical pattern of sic crystal in the case of the nanoparticle it was proven that the crystal structure was not altered by the functionalization process as there was no change in d spacing value so it implied that functionalization is a surface phenomenon which has no effect on the particles lattice structure 35 both the spectra is merged together as shown in fig 2 due to its highly common in nature after annealing at 700 c the sic sio2 peak was almost coincident with the pure sic peak and only a broad peak was observed covering 2θ values from 18 to 30 which confirmed the presence of amorphous silica and the effective oxidation of nanoparticles surface 26 31 moreover the shoulder peak located at the left side of the 111 peak was attributed to the stacking faults within sic and a new formed layer of sio2 32 the major peaks of the modified np were located at the same 2θ angle so no other phases were detected however the intensity slightly changed in 40 50 2θ region due to the presence of nh2 group the major peaks were observed at 35 739 41 504 60 144 71 971 75 716 and corresponded to the 111 002 022 113 and 222 planes respectively the xrd pattern thereby ascertained the presence of cubic sic 36 37 the principal moto for functionalization of nanoparticles is the transition of a hydrophobic non polar particle to a hydrophilic polar particle which results in its proper dispersion in water and in polar aprotic solvent like nmp n methyl 2 pyrrolidone the degree of alteration in the dispersion ability of the nanoparticles in the solvent depends on the changes engendered in the surface property of the procured np as such the present study attempted to functionalize the sic np to tailor the interfaces and transforming the wetting attribute for good dispersion of it in fig 3 the differences in the dispersion behaviour are shown aggregation of the unvarnished sic np post flocculation was observed and could be attributed to the high surface energy and hydrophobicity of the pristine sic np after annealing the particles albeit relatively stable and smooth still remained non dispersive owing to their unaltered hydrophobicity post amine functionalization the outstanding change in the nature of the nanoparticle occurred and the nanoparticles exhibited adequate stability and dispersed satisfactorily in the solvent after ultra sonication the observation further corroborated the successful incorporation of hydrophilic amine group into the particle surface which rendered the nanoparticles less prone to aggregation the surface morphology and the topographical difference between pristine and functionalized sic np were verified by fesem as shown in fig 4 the as received sic np was not well dispersed and the surface of the particle was rough compared to that of the modified one but in the case of the modified one the particles became more dispersive and smooth which implied that the surface hydrophilicity was greatly enhanced furthermore by sem analysis it clearly showed the effect of the amine nh2 groups on the extent of sic dispersion the as received sic np were agglomerated and cross linked with each other whereas the modified sic np were reorganized increasing in certain shape and size and particles became more regular and homogeneous in shape 19 3 2 characterisation of membranes 3 2 1 morphological characteristics the topographies of the membranes were significantly affected by the addition of functionalized and procured sic np the presence of np in the modified membranes was explored by comparing the morphologies of the pristine ca and modified ca membranes as inferred from their respective fesem images wherein the np loading corresponding to each of the modified membranes was 1 fig 5 a b and c indicated that each of the membranes was marked by a thin dense skin followed by a porous sub layer with the teardrop like macro voids 1 kx magnification was used to show the top surface of ca ca sic 1 0 and ca sic nh2 1 0 membrane fig 5 from the top surface analysis of the fesem images it can be seen that the amine functionalized nanoparticles incorporated ca membrane surface became more curving as the hydrophilic nanoparticles migrate from the membrane matrix to a water bath they could deform the membrane surface 20 the top surface of the membrane was nodulateduniformly 21 a typical fesem image mirroring the cross sectional morphology of a neat ca membrane ordinarily indicates a non porous structure which is a typical attribute of ca membrane as reported by many works of literature 14 the investigation of the images revealed that in the membranes the finger like macro voids along with the porous sub layer typically enhanced the membrane permeability the dense skin layer along with asymmetric microstructure operated as a selectively permeable barrier that indicates good selective separation 38 39 the alteration in skin layer and change in microscopic structure of the membranes are highly related to the hydrophilicity of the membrane material as the time of phase inversion the diffusion rate of water influence the coagulation rate of the nanopcmposite membrane and a kinetic instability took place so the fesem images indicated that the functionalized sic incorporated membrane was marked by an increase in pore size and a reduction in pore density as per the interfacial stresses between polymer and particles the de mixing process becomes more dominant and finally settled down by forming large pores in higher magnification of fesem it was also observable that in the dense sponge layer the presence of the np in both functionalized and raw sic incorporated membranes is significant the surface topography enhancement and the roughness parameter of the pure ca and composite membranes were derived from afm analysis fig 6 in the three dimensional surface images analysis the bright and dark areas corresponded to the peak and valleys respectively 9 the average roughness parameters ra were obtained from afm analysis and the values were compared for three different membranes fig 6 the surface roughness quantitative data manifested in table 2 indicated the highest surface roughness in case of the functionalized sic containing membrane the surface roughness parameters including the mean roughness sa the root mean square of the z data sq and the mean difference between the highest ridges and lowest rift sz were reported in table 2 the surface morphologies of the membranes were strongly influenced by the functionalized nanoparticles the roughness parameter values corresponding to the functionalized np incorporated membrane were appreciably high as compared to those corresponding to the neat ca and unvarnished sic contained membrane due to the active functionalities of the nh2 group the changes in the membrane structure and morphological improvement took place so it could be concluded that the upgradation in membrane surface area and active region brought about considerable augmentation in the membrane roughness in the case of nanocomposite membranes with functionalized sic content 33 40 41 the presence of nanoparticles accumulated the on surface increased the membrane roughness which in turn enhanced the hydrophilicity of the membrane thus reducing the adhesion energy between the surface and the organic pollutants and improving permeation and antifouling properties 16 membrane fouling decreased greatly following the increment in membrane roughness this claim was validated by further by investigating the antifouling performance of the membranes 3 2 2 chemical analysis ftir and xrd analysis was performed for understanding the chemical composition of the derived different membranes fig 7 a presents the ftir spectra of pristine ca ca with 1 unvarnished sic np and 1 functionalized sic np the characteristics band for ca as reported by various researchers was observed around 1750 cm 1 which corresponds to the co functional group 42 the prominent absorption band at 1303 cm 1 denoted the stretching for cc o c acetates as reported by j dasgupta et al in 2014 43 for the out of plane bending vibration of ch stretches a characteristic peak at 734 cm 1 was represented as the pure ca membrane is a nearly hydrophobic one so there might not be any presence of oh stretching during the range of 3000 4000 cm 1 and for any particular absorbance no spectra were found in this range in case of the nanocomposite membrane ca sic additional peak for various vibrational bonds of sic was found as previously shown for the sic np ftir analysis the same absorbance band was repeated in this case which highly implies that the strong binding between np and the polymer matrix in the spectra of ca sic nh2 1 wt membrane the new broad band near the 3200 3600 cm 1 emphasized the presence of oh stretching as being improved by the more water intake capacity due to increase in hydrophilicity though the peak value is little shifted from the position as it was in the ftir spectra of np due to the changes in chemical bonding for nanoparticle filler binding with the polymer matrix from the analysis of the reaction scheme as presented in fig 7 b we have proposed that the acetate group at the 6th position of the glucose unit of as received ca polymer is more accessible for the nh2 group of apdems because of less steric hindrance 44 46 the xrd pattern of pure ca membrane fig 8 revealed distinct peaks at 2θ values of 8 375 17 225 19 7601 and 22 475 which mirrored the purely amorphous polymeric nature of the pristine ca membrane in the case of nanocomposite membrane the additional peaks at 35 750 and 41 525 could be ascribed to the binding of sic np with the polymeric substrate the interlayer basal spacing and the angle of reflection were also modified due to the intercalation of sic np into the polymer chains the degree of particle dispersion could also be measured by estimating the distance between individual platelets in xrd 49 the peak locations showed a little shift presumably owing to the dispersion of nano sized sic np particles in the polymer matrices and the reasonable interaction between the np and the polymer matrix similar observations were reported by reza abedini et al 2011 30 3 2 3 tga tga was performed to examine further the response of pure ca and composites membranes at different temperatures as depicted in fig 9 after the loss of all the solvents present in the membrane each cellulose acetate membrane degraded rapidly in a single step nearly between 250 and 400 c and weight residue become 93 94 to 16 38 due to the polymer chain break down due to the higher thermal stability of sic nanoparticle the degradation temperature of the ca chain slightly increased presumably owing to the strong binding between the polymer and the nanoparticle 21 on the other hand the amine functionalized np embedded ca membrane in the second region comparatively showed degradation in lower temperature as seen by fesem analysis it was also visible that the membrane s nonporous sub layer structure is responsible for having strong resistance to heat flow than that of the porous m5 membrane the ca membrane showed better performance after adding sic np due to the strong heat resistant capacity while due to functionalizing slight degradation was observed due to hydrophilic interaction and for pure ca membrane it is observed that the nonporous spongy sub layer occupied more space than the pores so it degraded rapidly 31 another interesting study can be made by this observation that in the third step where carbonization and ash formation occurs which shows the main degradation step in that stage both types of nanoparticle incorporated membranes showed better performance comparing to the pure ca due to the increase in porosity the degradation of ca skeleton backbone is more rapid and for better distribution the binding between the np and the polymer the membrane become more susceptible to degrade and ash content generation is slightly more than that of pure ca membrane at about 590 c the wt residues of pure ca ca sic ca sic nh2 were 9 6 10 9 and 11 5 respectively which implied that the strong binding between the np and the polymer presumably hindered the leaching out of functionalized np the weight residue became slightly less for raw sic due to poor interaction and aggregation which anticipated the leaching out of raw unstable nanoparticles from the membrane matrix 43 as shown in fig 9 the sic nh2 nanomaterial incorporated hybrid ca membrane showed better performance than any other casted membrane the increment in the weight percentage residue of the m5 membrane than the pure membrane m1 strongly anticipated nanoparticles addition it also anticipated the strong binding between the membrane matrix and functionalized nanoparticles as the residue mostly contained inorganic particles after tga 43 3 3 wetting properties porosity and mean pore radius of different membranes the wettability of the membranes was evaluated based on water content porosity and wca measurement the hydrophilicity is the principal factors which influences membrane permeability as well the antifouling propensity 29 the porosity of all the composite membranes differed from each other significantly this could be explained as the addition of different types and amount of np into the polymer matrix lead to fluctuations in solvent and non solvent exchange degree at the time of phase inversion 22 the data in table 3 suggested that the increase in the sic content in the casting solution from 0 5 to 1 enhanced the extent of agglomeration of the nanoparticles presumably due to the hydrophobic nature of sic np thereby reducing the porosity of the membranes 16 on the other hand following the addition of the surface furnished np the porosity of the membranes increased outstandingly due to the hydrophilicity and the enhanced dispersion of the functionalized sic nh2 np in the ca matrix the increase in the porosity of the membranes could be attributed to the enhanced demixing rate at the time of phase inversion process along with the high mutual diffusivity of nmp and water these tendencies affect roughness and water flux as well the obtained values of the the water contact angle moreover serves as an index of membrane hydrophilicity the wca values in fig 10 suggested that the water contact angle of 1 modified sic content membrane was 58 6 which was the lowest among all the membranes this indicated that the membrane m5 manifested the maximum hydrophilicity among all the membranes under consideration in the present study also the hydrophilic group present in the membrane improved its hydrophilicity as the functional group of nanoparticle could partially inhibit the pore growth so in case of m4 and m5 pore size was reduced than the m2 and m3 as by the capillary flow analysis we can see the mean pore size decreased significantly upon addition of f sic nanoparticles table 3 though with comparison to m1 this functionalized sic incorporated membranes showed increment in pore size due to the hydrophilic functional group addition 3 4 tensile strength of the membranes the mechanical property of any membrane serves as an index of the ability of the membranes to withstand pressure driven stress during operation and maintenance as such the mechanical attributes determine the possibility of membrane service life enhancement thereby ascertaining its suitability for industrial usage in order to categorize the impact of interfacial interaction between the np and polymer matrix the tensile strength and break elongation were measured at the dry condition addition of any inorganic particles certainly improves mechanical properties because the inorganic particles strain can be uniformly dispersed within the matrix again the agglomeration propensity of nanoparticles due to relatively high surface tension certainly diminishes the breaking at the elongation point here comes the necessity of adding functional groups to the nanoparticles proper distribution into the membrane matrix but in this case for increasing hydrophilicity mobility in the polymer chain took place the polymer matrix expanded as polymeric chain movement became more rapid due to increment in the hydrophilicity 47 48 so for making the membrane viable to use in real life application it is essential to increase the hydrophilicity to such a limit that mechanical property must not be hazarded 12 the mechanical properties and thickness of different ca membranes were shown in table 4 as by adding 1 wt functionalized sic np porosity of the membranes increased that also elevate to decrase in reducing mechanical properties nevertheless these modified membrane could be still procured for the practical application for its mechanical properties by analyzing fig 11 we can depict that for functionalized np embedded polymer membrane become weak in tensile strength though it is evident that uniformity and proper dispersion were more for functionalized np embedded polymer the weak mechanical strength of m3 membrane probably due to the higher concentration of nascent nanoparticles which certainly forms agglomeration though m5 membrane could with stand the necessary operating stress but tensile strength reduced comparing to m1 membrane this observation owing that due to changes in chemical structure of pure ca polymer with the addition of amine functionalized sic which also causes the changes in pore formation and increment in porosity as proposed by other researchers this phenomenon could be attributed that this weakening in mechanical strength probably due to the changes in polymer structure and consecutively increment in porosity 39 50 as for both the case of upon addition of more nanoparticle sic sic nh2 might be due to the dilution effect of polymer solution which plays a crucial role due to the formation of porous supporting sublayer structure however the proclaimed functionalized np content membrane still may achieve the unavoidable mechanical requirement for microfiltration or ultrafiltration process 3 5 permeation study of the membranes two cast membranes were tested for water flux bsa flux and bsa protein rejection using a dead end flow membrane module apparatus the flux enhancement of a nanocomposite membrane mainly depends on surface hydrophilicity owing to the fact that the incorporated by incorporating hydrophilic nanomaterial water molecule can be drawn rapidly and by enhancing the pore size flux can be elevated 51 m5 membrane demonstrated a pore size of 0 10 μm and the porosity of the m5 membrane was 89 82 respectively as observed by fesem images as well from capillary flow analysis the water flux was increased for m5 membrane increased presumably owing to the significant increment in pore size and lower wca value fig 12 depicts the effect of amine functionalized sic on the pure water flux and bsa flux at different pressures moreover as the pressure increased the flux value increased significantly for all the cases as exhibited in fig 12 in the case of bsa flux m5 showed better results though the flux value did not increase significantly the bsa rejection using membranes m1 and m5 were explored at different pressures as shown in fig 13 the flux value was greatly enhanced for m5 due to the high hydrophilicity bigger pore size and porosity the bsa rejection by m5 value to be mentioned albeit lower than that obtained using m1 membrane value to be mentioned was nevertheless adequately high similar observations have been reported in literature 52 this interesting observation apparently contradicted the membrane porosity and pore size data nevertheless the obtained results could be accounted for by the fact that the amine group nh2 introduced into the membrane surface not only engendered a proper passage for water but also protected the membrane from bsa foulant the pure ca membrane also showed a positive effect in bsa rejection due to small pore size 39 in case of m5 membrane the functionalization with amine terminal apdems allowed for the attachment with biological molecules which presumably resulted in greater rejection 53 that attachment of bsa with any surface offers the combination of 3 types of interaction this binding force is enhanced for the amine functionalized nanoparticle with any organic molecule into the membrane matrix it can include hydrophobic interaction by weak van dar walls hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interaction 16 in our case compared to the hydrophobic interaction electrostatic interaction showed much influence as negatively charged bsa protein dissociated in the pbs solution could offer attachment with the nh2 group hypothetically present on the polymer matrix 54 55 thus the rejection of bsa protein by the synthesized modified membrane was quite impressive the bsa rejection achieved using m5 moreover demonstrated only a marginal increase following the increment of pressure from the graph it is evident that for m5 membrane the increased porosity and pore size led to reasonably good flux but the rejection was not also compromised the overall experimental protocol for the oil water separation study is shown in fig 14 oil water emulsion separation experiment was performed by a vacuum filtration unit as shown in fig 14 a the separation study was performed using pure ca membrane 1 sic and 1 sic nh2 contained membrane compared with the emulsion before separation the filtrate was transparent without any contaminant and was markedly devoid of any oil droplets while the original emulsion was pure dense white shown in fig 14 b so the oil was completely retained by the separation membranes additionally the respective separation efficiencies of the membranes were also calculated due to the appreciable hydrophilicity and good pore size the performance of the membranes apropos of toluene water emulsion treatment was adequately significant the surfactant stabilized oil in water treatment is much more difficult than the separation of immiscible oil from water the percentage of oil rejection using the three of the membranes is shown in fig 14 c from the results it is evident that the oil rejection using pure ca membrane m5 ca sic nh2 membrane and raw sic loaded ca membrane were 77 30 94 86 and 53 respectively the hydrophilicity of membranes is the theoretical basis for separating oil water mixture regardless of the extent of emulsification 2 the water molecules from the emulsion were attracted and diffused through the hydrophilic m5 membrane surface by solution diffusion mechanism and passed through the porous membranes due to capillary action retaining the oil particles 56 hence the functionalized sic blended ca membrane enhanced the separation of oil from oil water emulsions and the results thereby affirmed that the efficiency of the membranes with regard to oil contaminated wastewater treatment the surfactant stabilized oil in water emulsion solution was prepared with 1 3 ration of toluene and water the images of the feed and filtrates treated by m5 membrane are manifested in fig 14 c if we examine the mechanism of oil water separation by the pure ca membrane due to the higher water contact angle of this membrane oil particle was permeated through this and as emulsion was there some water molecule was also permeated though the efficiency was achieved by 77 30 for its very small pore size but in the case of raw sic blended membrane the mechanism of separation is different as pore size increase much so rejection efficiency compromised and for the most modified m5 membrane though the flux value was increased separation efficiency was not at all compromised for its pore size and water contact angle attribution considering the obtained from this separation study the conclusion was consistent with the results generated by way of the fesem analysis the pore flow analysis and the water contact angle study too though bsa rejection had been compromised 3 using the m5 membrane than the m1 membrane the rejection was not much lower compared to the reported study 57 this decrement in rejection was observed due to an increment in pore size from 0 03 μm for pure ca m1 to 0 10 μm for modified functionalized nanoparticles incorporated membranes m5 the mechanism for bsa and oil water separation study was different for the bsa rejection due to the smaller pore size of the m1 membrane it performed better than the m5 membrane whereas in the case of oil water separation it performed better due to the lower hydrophilicity of the m5 membrane the water passed through the membrane retaining the toluene from the emulsion by the solution diffusion mechanism moreover toluene is not readily soluble in water than the bsa molecule bsa solution protein molecules are highly soluble in water for hydrogen bonding and could easily pass through the microfiltration membrane and for toluene water emulsion due to weak van der waals s force it is not readily soluble and less energy is required to break down the emulsion for the improved hydrophilicity of the m5 membrane water can pass through easily by retaining the toluene from the emulsion additionally the typical droplet size of the dispersed oil in water emulsion of the toluene ranges from 0 5 to 5 0 μm 58 59 this anticipated successful rejection of toluene by the synthesized m5 membrane as tested pore sizes by capillary flow analysis are 0 10 μm smaller than the emulsion size range though the membranes hydrophilicity was the more dominant factor for the oil rejection than the size exclusion mechanism the authors performed this exciting observation that the membrane could get optimally used for oil water separation purposes for its trade off relationship between water contact angle and pore size parameters basically for the high water affinity by m5 membrane toluene rejection was higher 3 6 antifouling performance of the membrane membrane fouling is a significant factor affecting the technological viability of the polymeric membrane in terms of practical application by the simple hydraulic cleaning reversible fouling gel or cake layer can be removed as it is ordinarily caused by loose deposition of foulant on the membrane surface 16 the time dependent flux study involving cyclic filtration wherein bsa was the model protein foulant was carried out using all the membrane to determine their respective degrees of endurance against fouling and the results affirmed the competence of the functionalized sic content membrane apropos of water treatment from the fig 15 we can observe the maximum pure water flux of m1 was about 2800 l m2 hr during the 1st run the pure water flux of the modified membrane increased significantly as compared to unmodified m1 one for both the membranes the flux obtained by way of protein microfiltration dropped dramatically as compared to the original pure water flux in the first 10 min of protein microfiltration before stabilizing following the attainment of equilibrium under stirred condition between the deposition of bsa macromolecules on the membrane surface and the dislodgement of bsa molecules from the membrane surface a steady flux was achieved in each case beyond the abrupt drop in the first stage 20 following the flux study the antifouling property manifested by the m5 could be ascribed to its hydrophilicity hence the adsorption of protein molecules was only onto the membrane surface and not onto the pore walls of the membrane in case of m5 but in case of pure ca membrane for the absence of amine group the bsa protein came through the pore channel 16 in case of the modified m5 membrane the bsa protein may also come to the pore channeling but attached irreversibly due to the functionalized nanoparticle and polar organic molecule interaction so the irreversible protein fouling was 14 63 for m5 membrane whereas for m1 membrane it was 39 28 thus the f sic incorporated membrane manifested fairly superior antifouling attribute as compared to the pure ca membrane from the table 5 it can also be elucidated that the flux recovery ratio frr for m5 membrane was greater than m1 for the presence of amine group the fesem image of m5 membrane exhibited significant enhancement in number of pores and thereby substantial increase in the permeability of the nanocomposite membrane by the bsa flux analysis we can see that them5 membrane flux was more with time than the flux ofm1 and also in case of m5 as time increased the flux value reached a steady state value but in case of the m1 the flux declined with the increase in time following the inclusion of the nh2 group in the membrane matrix the lone pair of electrons on the n atom increased the affinity of the membrane for water molecules by way of hydrogen bond formation and thereby improved the wettability of the modified membrane so the bsa molecules did not foul the membrane but in case of pure ca the membrane got easily fouled and after washing for m5 the water flux traced an increasing trajectory again and reached a level nearly as high as the original value but for m1 the flux recovery after membrane washing was not adequate and the water flux after washing not reached so much as of the 1st run the fabricated membranes as such manifested improved antifouling attributes 4 conclusion the cellulose acetate nanocomposite membranes were synthesized using the phase inversion technique the modified membranes performance was investigated to see the effect of amine nh2 functionalized sic filler material the difference between weight residue by tga analysis of pure ca membrane and ca sic nh2 indicates that functionalized nanoparticles into the membrane matrix cause the increment in weight percentage residue the flux recovery ratio frr achieved using the modified membrane was 85 36 while that obtained using the pure one was 60 71 94 86 retention of toluene was acquired from the oil water emulsion therefore the results affirmed that the modified membranes given their easy fabrication and improved attributes could be applied by industries as an environmentally benign and cost competitive technique to bring about the separation of oil from oil contaminated industrial wastewater the results also revealed that the silicon carbide nanoparticles could enhance the membrane properties the slight heterogeneity in nanocomposite membrane was mostly induced by partial agglomeration of sic and sic nh2 np s or the casting solution s re stacking further work is required to know the specific correlation among the hydrophilicity surface roughness and pore size of the membrane declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgments the heartiest gratitude to the

13522,the chemical energy contained in wastewater can be considered as a promising sustainable energy source and can be recovered using microbial fuel cell technology by means of electro active bacteria there are several brewery industries releasing wastewater into the environment posing serious environmental issues herein we demonstrated treatment of brewery wastewater and production of bioelectricity simultaneously using double chamber mfcs by inoculating locally isolated microorganisms microorganisms were locally isolated from brewery waste sludge named as bsgb1 and bsgb2 brewery wastewater bwgb3 and bwgb4 and food processing industry waste sludge fsgb5 and fsgb6 total dissolved solids tds chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod were determined before and after treatment of brewery wastewater by locally isolated microorganisms the results revealed that the microorganisms isolated from brewery waste sludge outperformed the bacteria isolated from brewery wastewater and food processing industry waste sludge the maximum power density of 0 8 w m3 and 0 35 w m3 was generated by mfc inoculated with locally isolated microorganisms from brewery waste sludge using the synthetic and real brewery wastewater respectively the removal efficiency of cod was 79 83 indicating significant treatment of brewery wastewater by locally isolated microorganisms while generating sustainable and clean energy keywords microbial fuel cell mfc brewery wastewater bio electricity microroganisms and brewery waste sludge 1 introduction the demand for sustainable energy requirement is increasing every day throughout the world and 1 2 billion people in the world will be living without accessing electricity in 2030 of which the majority of people will be living in sub saharan africa india and other developing asian countries the current energy production in the world comes from fossil fuels which has a share of 90 for the projected increase in demand and will be remained a dominant energy source in the future which is predicted to contribute 80 in 2030 1 moreover burning of fossil fuels generates carbon dioxide and has shown significant consequences in the environment hence investigating alternate sources of energy with low initial investment and eco friendly have become a prime necessity 2 recently microbial fuel cells mfcs have drawn increasing world wide attention for treatment of wastes and generating cleaner electricity directly from organic matters 2 8 hence minimizing the discharge of waste into the environment microbial fuel cells mfcs are an incipient technology that directly convert the chemical energy stored in organic matter to biofuel ethanol and hydrogen etc and electricity from wastewater correspondingly minimise energy climate crisis and environmental pollution 9 12 mfc is a multipurpose technology and can be used for cleaner electric generation wastewater treatment recovery of pure materials removal of organic matters water softening bioremediations dye decolorization and biosensor applications 13 18 microbial fuel cells also have many advantages compared with currently used technologies for generating energy from organic matter alike the direct conversion of substrate energy to electricity enables high conversion efficiency mfcs operate under mild condition no need of gas pre treatment as the off gases in mfcs are enriched in carbon dioxide and do not contain useful energy hence environmentally friendly 19 mfc generates clean energy directly from organic matter found in wastewater without any pre treatment of the wastewater such as separation and purification despite in some cases there is a need for wastewater separation and purification before use for methane and hydrogen production for instance a research report shows that 1 43 kw h m3 after removing the large particles from the primary sludge and 1 8 kw h m3 from pre digested sludge can be generated using mfc 20 mfcs do not need energy input for aeration and saves energy by treating wastewater anaerobically 21 comparatively mfc uses the energy of 0 024 kw or 0 07 kw h kg cod for feeding and mixing in the reactor while the energy required by the activated sludge based aerobic treatment method is 0 3 kw or 0 6 kw h kg cod which consumes higher energy 22 23 moreover mfc generates much less sludge during wastewater treatment 0 06 0 16 gvss gcod compared to the active aeration treatment method where sludge production can be reached as high as 0 35 0 45 gvss gcod 16 24 indicating sludge management during waste treatment using mfc is not a big deal like other conventional waste treatment methods mfcs have potentials for widespread applications in treating brewery wastewater and generation of electricity 19 25 26 and can also operate with different fuels to fulfil energy requirements in ethiopia especially in addis ababa there are several industries which are generating huge amount of industrial wastewater and releasing untreated or partially treated wastewater into the environment causing serious environmental issues 27 28 brewery industries in ethiopia pose significant water pollution problems by discharging untreated or partially treated wastewater 29 recently there was an effort only to treat brewery wastewater by isolating indigenous bacteria from polluted areas 30 in this connection the present study is designed both to treat brewery wastewater and production of bioelectricity simultaneously using double chamber mfcs by employing locally isolated geobacter spp experiments were carried out in batch mode and compared the efficiency of production of electricity and removal of organic matter by locally isolated microbial species from three different waste sources brewery waste sludge brewery

brewery wastewater and sludge samples were collected in sterilized plastic containers from st george brewery factory located at lidata sub city administration of addis ababa city other sludge samples were collected from misrak food complex factory a food processing industry located at kirkos sub city addis ababa all samples were brought to laboratory addis ababa university and stored at 4 c in the refrigerator for further analysis 2 3 isolation and enrichment of microorganisms isolation enrichment and morphological identification of microorganisms geobacter species were performed according to the standard procedures of bergey s manual of systematics bacteriology 31 each collected sample was serially diluted with distilled water in tenfold dilution factor 1 ml solution was pipetted out from each diluted sample and spread on petridish separately after adding the acetate solution and fe iii solution the petridish was tightly closed by using plaster tape and placed in an anaerobic jar under strictly anaerobic condition and incubated for 1 week at 30 c then the petridishes were taken out from the jar and different bacterial colonies were observed the incubated colonies were used for morphological study by using gram s staining 2 4 morphological characterizations of microorganisms the isolated bacteria were grown in a medium containing 0 1 g l of kcl 1 5 g l of nh4cl 0 6 g l of

120 c for 15 min and cooled for 60 min before inoculation with the isolated bacteria the bacteria grown from brewery waste sludge were named as bsgb1 and bsgb2 microorganisms grown from brewery wastewater were assigned as bwgb3 and bwgb4 finally microorganisms grown from food industry sludge were assigned as fsgb5 and fsgb6 after the growth all microorganisms were preserved in the refrigerator for inoculation of mfc morphological characterizations were performed for all isolated colonies according to gram staining standard procedure 33 34 a smear of bacterial cells was prepared on a clean glass slide by a gentle heat fixation the heated smear glass slide was flooded with crystal violet solution for one minute then glass slide was washed with distilled water followed by adding gram s iodine the smear glass slide was decolorized with 95 ethanol and rinsed with water finally safranin was used as counter stains for 60 80 seconds and washed with distilled water then after cells were examined under light microscope 2 5 mfcs construction and operation two glass bottles 1 l capacity each connected by u shaped glass tube salt bridge 30 cm length and diameter 1 5 cm

15 min and cooled for 1 h before inoculated with extracted microorganisms the cathode chamber was filled with 1 m potassium ferricyanide k3 fe cn 6 800 ml and operated aerobically where reduction reaction takes place 36 in order to evaluate the efficiency of electricity production and treating wastewater bacteria six different isolated bacteria bsgb1 and bsgb2 isolated from brewery waste sludge bwgb3 and bwgb4 isolated from brewery wastewater and fsgb5 and fsgb6 isolated from food complex industry waste sludge were inoculated in the anode chamber of mfcs separately as shown in fig 1 voltage generation by microorganisms was monitored digital multimeter dl multi999det model at 1 h interval on day time across 1000 ω resistance at room temperature the average voltage generated per day is reported in this work current density and power density of each mfc were calculated as follow i a u r and p u2 r v where i is current u is the voltage volt generated by microorganisms r is resistance 1000 ω and v is the volume of the reactor 800 ml 0 0008 m3 and p is power density w m3 2 6 physicochemical characterization of brewery wastewater before and after treatment of the wastewater by locally isolated microorganisms the physicochemical properties of brewery wastewater were performed cod was measured by using a standard method of apha 5220 b bod by winkler apha1998 ph was determined by apha4500 h b apha 2005 phosphate content was measured by hach lange lck349 hach1999 nitrate ion was measured by hach lange lck340 hach 1999 3 results and discussion herein we report the production of voltage and wastewater treatment simultaneously by employing locally isolated geobacter spp in home made mfcs microorganisms were gown from brewery waste sludge bsgb1 and bsgb2 brewery wastewaster bwgb3 and bwgb4 and food processing industry waste sludge fsgb5 and fsgb6 all microorganisms from three different waste sources were inoculated with a specific medium which is used for the growth of specific bacteria called geobactor metallireducence 32 3 1 morphological characteristics of microorganisms enriched on specific media microorganisms from different waste sources such as brewery wastewater brewery waste sludge and food processing industry waste sludge were grown in batch anaerobically all microorganisms from three different waste sources were inoculated with the prepared medium light microscopy images show a straight or slightly curved rod shaped in pars or chains with light pink colour for bacteria colonies isolated from three different sources indicating the gram negative nature fig 2 the microorganisms isolated from brewery waste sludge shown more biomass fig 2a compared with the microorganisms isolated from brewery wastewater and food processing industry waste sludge fig 2 b c the morphological characterization of isolated bacteria is presented in table 1 3 2 electricity generation from synthetic wastewater the anodic chambers of six constructed mfcs were inoculated with isolated bacterial from different waste sources separately generation of voltage from each mfc at fixed load of 1000 ω resistance was monitored in 1 h intervals for 18 days using a multi meter dl mult1999det except the bacteria isolated from food complex processing factory all mfc inoculated with bacteria isolated from brewery waste sources generated significant amount of voltage bacteria isolated from food complex processing factory waste sludge generates a maximum of only 0 005 v compared to others fig 3 c this is may be the geobacter specific media is not suitable for the microorganisms extracted from food complex processing factory and could not help to generate significance voltage from synthetic wastewater from the morphological analysis result it is shown that less colonies were observed by light microscope comparing with the microorganisms on the first day of inoculation bacteria isolated from brewery wastewater generated higher voltage 0 2 v compared to mfc inoculated with other bacteria on the second day of inoculation all bacteria isolated from brewery wastewater and brewery waste sludge started voltage generation in general bacterial isolates from brewery waste sludge generated higher voltage than bacterial isolates from brewery wastewater and food processing industry sludge sources the average voltage of 0 7 to 0 8 v was generated by bsgb2 isolate on the 5th to 11th day of inoculation however the generation of voltage was dramatically dropped after the 12th day of inoculation moreover bsgb1 isolate also showed gradually increase in production of voltage and its maximum production of voltage 0 75 v was recorded on the 18th day the current generation of the four mfcs inoculated with bacteria isolates from brewery wastewater and brewery waste sludge is shown in fig 3b for the maximum voltage of 0 8 v generated by bsgb2 the maximum current density of 1a m3 was recorded fig 3b comparing wastes from brewery factory bacteria isolated from brewery waste sludge outperformed the bacteria isolated from brewery wastewater this is may be geobacter specific media is compatible for the bacteria colony isolated from brewery waste sludge the maximum power density of 0 8 w m3 and 0 7 w m3 were generated by bsgb2 and bsgb1 respectively both isolated from brewery waste sludge fig 4 based on the performance of bacteria in synthetic wastewater two bacteria bsgb1 and bsgb2 isolates were selected to evaluate their performance in production of bioelectricity and treatment of real wastewater simultaneously 3 3 bio electricity generation from brewery wastewater since only two bacterial isolates from brewery waste sludge were outperform the other bacterial isolates gsbgb1 and gsgb2 were inoculated in mfc with real brewery wastewater for bio energy generation and operated batch mode for 28 days significant amount of bio electricity production was observed from brewery wastewater by both bacteria bsgb1 and bsgb2 fig 5 up to two days of inoculation generation of voltage was not noticed starting from the third day of inoculation voltage generation by mfc was steadily increased locally isolated bacteria gsbgb1 and gsgb2 were inoculated in anodic chamber and a very thin whitish biofilm formation was observed on the graphite rod that was used as anode in the constructed mfc this explains that the positive correlation exists in between the biofilm formation of geobacter on anode terminal with the time period this indicates that the biofilm self stabilized on the anode surface of carbon electrodes similarly it was reported that the growth of biofilm on the anode surface in mfc is of high importance for the steady current production and maintenance of voltage 37 generated average voltage and current density values were found to evolve over time till the stabilization of biofilm fig 5 significantly maximum voltage of 0 52 v 0 65 a m3 and 0 47 v 0 59a m3 were generated by bsgb1 and bsgb2 bacteria isolates respectively on 19th day of inoculation however after the 20th day of inoculation the voltage generation by bacteria isolates is declined indicating that the biomass bacterial growth is decreasing due to the lack of substrate energy source for the bacteria in the wastewater the initial rapid increase in production of voltage bioelectricity could be attributed to the presence of suitable nutrients organic matter that are easily utilized by bacteria this shows production of bioelectricity is directly proportional to the availability of organic matter in the wastewater which is used by bacterial isolates by which the production of bioelectricity take place and clearly indicates that as substrate utilization and degradation of organic matter rapidly leading to decreased in voltage these degraded products could be oxidized directly by electro active bacterial isolates from the real wastewater a maximum of 0 27 w m3 0 35 w m3 power density was generated by inoculating locally isolated bacteria bsgb1 and bsgb2 in home made mfc fig 6 the generation of power density starts to decline after the 20th day of inoculation confirming the degradation of organic matters by locally isolated microorganisms in the real brewery wastewater 3 4 degradation and removal nutrients from brewery wastewater the physicochemical properties of brewery wastewater were carried out before and after treated by bsgb1 and bsgb2 inoculated mfcs as shown in the table 2 bsgb1 and bsgb2 bacteria isolates played a key role in breaking down the nutrients i e organic matter most efficiently while generating bioelectricity leading to significant removal of cod and bod however there were no significant changes observed in the concentration of phosphate and nitrate indicating fermentation is a main process in this reaction whereas mfcs can generate bio energy from the organic matter and simultaneously removing carbon and nitrogen 4 38 39 the results clearly showed that the mfcs can be used for treating wastewater in ethiopia at the same time mfc can serve as alternative source for power generation as a reliable clean efficient device which employs renewable methods without generating any toxic by products therefore in the future mfcs can be a promising potential technology for recovery and in situ conversion of chemical energy into electricity 2 3 5 comparison of power generated with literature values comparisons of the values of voltage current density and power density generated by inoculating mfc with locally isolated microorganisms with others work reported in literature are summarized in table 3 the values of power density generated by mfcs innoculated with locally isolated microorganisms are comparable with the values reported literature values in this work the maximum power density generated by inoculating mfcs with locally isolated microorganisms is in the range of 276 350 mw m3 which was generated by microorganisms isolated from brewery waste sludge 4 conclusion in this work geobacter spp were locally isolated from three different waste sources brewery wastewater food processing industry waste sludge and brewery waste sludge and isolated bacteria were inoculated in microbial fuel cell and demonstrated for the first time in ethiopia for wastewater treatment and bio electricity generation this study concluded that mfcs innoculated with locally isolated microorganisms can be a sustainable and eco friendly technology for energy bioelectricity generation and simultaneous wastewater treatment with significant removal of cod bod and tds based on the morphological characterizations the better performing microorganisms with circular form of colony raised elevator and pink red color of colony were locally isolated from brewery waste sludge and remove more than 83 of cod from brewery wastewater the inoculated mfcs were able to generate power density of 350 mw m3 from brewery wastewater with the maximum cod bod tds removal efficiency of 79 83 67 70 and 76 78 respectively indicating significant treatment of brewery wastewater while generating sustainable and clean energy among locally isolated microorganisms microorganisms isolated from brewery waste sludge bsgb1 bsgb2 present better performance in electricity generation and wastewater treatment the probable reason is that bsgb1 bsgb2 microorganisms have got suitable conditions to grow in the wastewater compared to microorganisms isolated from brewery waste and food processing industry waste sludge therefore it is concluded that particularly for the treatment of brewery wastewater locally isolated microorganisms from the brewery waste sludge itself is more suitable than microorganisms isolated from the food processing waste sludge for green electricity generation and wastewater treatment simultaneously thus mfcs innoclulated with locally isolated microorganisms in the case of treatment of brewery wastewater will pave the way for minimising sustainable energy crisis and environmental pollution using microbial fuel cell technology author contributions l w negassa conceptualization experimental

13522,the chemical energy contained in wastewater can be considered as a promising sustainable energy source and can be recovered using microbial fuel cell technology by means of electro active bacteria there are several brewery industries releasing wastewater into the environment posing serious environmental issues herein we demonstrated treatment of brewery wastewater and production of

after treatment of brewery wastewater by locally isolated microorganisms the results revealed that the microorganisms isolated from brewery waste sludge outperformed the bacteria isolated from brewery

using the synthetic and real brewery wastewater respectively the removal efficiency of cod was 79 83 indicating significant treatment of brewery wastewater by locally isolated microorganisms while generating sustainable and clean energy keywords microbial fuel cell mfc brewery wastewater bio electricity microroganisms and brewery waste sludge 1 introduction the demand for sustainable energy requirement is increasing every day throughout the world and 1 2 billion people in the world will be living without accessing electricity in 2030 of which the majority of people will be living in sub saharan africa india and other developing asian countries the current energy production in the world comes from fossil fuels which has a share of 90 for the projected increase in demand and will be remained a dominant energy source in the future which is predicted to contribute 80 in 2030 1 moreover burning of fossil fuels generates carbon dioxide and has shown significant consequences in the environment hence investigating alternate sources of energy with low initial investment and eco friendly have become a prime necessity 2 recently microbial fuel cells mfcs have drawn increasing world wide attention for treatment of wastes and generating cleaner electricity directly from organic matters 2 8 hence minimizing the discharge of waste into the environment microbial fuel cells mfcs are an incipient technology that directly convert the chemical energy stored in organic matter to biofuel ethanol and hydrogen etc and electricity from wastewater correspondingly minimise energy climate crisis and environmental pollution 9 12 mfc is a multipurpose technology and can be used for cleaner electric generation wastewater treatment recovery of pure materials removal of organic matters water softening bioremediations dye decolorization and biosensor applications 13 18 microbial fuel cells also have many advantages compared with currently used technologies for generating energy from organic matter alike the direct conversion of substrate energy to electricity enables high conversion efficiency mfcs operate under mild condition no need of gas pre treatment as the off gases in mfcs are enriched in carbon dioxide and do not contain useful energy hence environmentally friendly 19 mfc generates clean energy directly from organic matter found in wastewater without any pre treatment of the wastewater such as separation and purification despite in some cases there is a need for wastewater separation and purification before use for methane and hydrogen production for instance a research report shows that 1 43 kw h m3 after removing the large particles from the primary sludge and 1 8 kw h m3 from pre digested sludge can be generated using mfc 20 mfcs do not need energy input for aeration and saves energy by treating wastewater anaerobically 21 comparatively mfc uses the energy of 0 024 kw or 0 07 kw h kg cod for feeding and mixing in the reactor while the energy required by the activated sludge based aerobic treatment method is 0 3 kw or 0 6 kw h kg cod which consumes higher energy 22 23 moreover mfc generates much less sludge during wastewater treatment 0 06 0 16 gvss gcod compared to the active aeration treatment method where sludge production can be reached as high as 0 35 0 45 gvss gcod 16 24 indicating sludge management during waste treatment using mfc is not a big deal like other conventional waste treatment methods mfcs have potentials for widespread applications in treating brewery wastewater and generation of electricity 19 25 26 and can also operate with different fuels to fulfil energy requirements in ethiopia especially in addis ababa there are several industries which are generating huge amount of industrial wastewater and releasing untreated or partially treated wastewater into the environment causing serious environmental issues 27 28 brewery industries in ethiopia pose significant water pollution problems by discharging untreated or partially treated wastewater 29 recently there was an effort only to treat brewery wastewater by isolating indigenous bacteria from polluted areas 30 in this connection the present study is designed both to treat brewery wastewater and production of bioelectricity simultaneously using double chamber mfcs by employing locally isolated geobacter spp experiments were carried out in batch

brewery wastewater and sludge samples were collected in sterilized plastic containers from st george brewery factory located at lidata sub city administration of addis ababa city other sludge samples were collected from misrak food complex factory a food processing industry located at kirkos sub city addis ababa all samples were brought to laboratory addis ababa university and stored at 4 c in the

the standard procedures of bergey s manual of systematics bacteriology 31 each collected sample was serially diluted with distilled water in tenfold dilution factor 1 ml solution was pipetted out from each diluted sample and spread on petridish separately after adding the acetate solution and fe iii solution the petridish was tightly closed by using plaster tape and placed in an anaerobic jar under strictly anaerobic condition and incubated for 1 week at 30 c then the petridishes were taken out from the jar and different bacterial colonies were observed the incubated colonies were used for

120 c for 15 min and cooled for 60 min before inoculation with the isolated bacteria the bacteria grown from brewery waste sludge were named as bsgb1 and bsgb2 microorganisms grown from brewery wastewater were assigned as bwgb3 and bwgb4 finally microorganisms grown from food industry sludge were assigned as fsgb5 and fsgb6 after the growth all microorganisms were preserved in the refrigerator for inoculation of mfc morphological characterizations were performed for all isolated colonies according to gram staining standard procedure 33 34 a smear of bacterial cells was prepared on a clean glass slide by a gentle heat fixation the heated smear glass slide was flooded with crystal violet solution for one minute then glass slide was washed with distilled water followed by adding gram s iodine the smear glass slide was decolorized with 95 ethanol and rinsed with water finally safranin was used as counter stains for 60 80 seconds and washed with distilled water then after cells were examined under light microscope 2 5 mfcs construction and operation two glass bottles 1 l capacity each connected by u shaped glass tube salt bridge 30 cm length and diameter 1 5 cm

reaction takes place 36 in order to evaluate the efficiency of electricity production and treating wastewater bacteria six different isolated bacteria bsgb1 and bsgb2 isolated from brewery waste sludge bwgb3 and bwgb4 isolated from brewery wastewater and fsgb5 and fsgb6 isolated from food complex industry waste sludge were inoculated in the anode chamber of mfcs separately as shown in fig 1 voltage generation by microorganisms was monitored digital multimeter dl multi999det model at 1 h interval on day time across 1000 ω resistance at room temperature the average voltage generated per

resistance 1000 ω and v is the volume of the reactor 800 ml 0 0008 m3 and p is power density w m3 2 6 physicochemical characterization of brewery wastewater before and after treatment of the wastewater by locally isolated microorganisms the physicochemical properties of brewery wastewater were performed cod was measured by using a standard method of apha 5220 b bod by winkler apha1998 ph was determined by apha4500 h b apha 2005 phosphate content was measured by hach lange lck349 hach1999 nitrate ion was measured by hach lange lck340 hach 1999 3 results and discussion herein we report the production of voltage and wastewater treatment simultaneously by employing locally isolated geobacter spp in home made mfcs microorganisms were gown from brewery waste sludge bsgb1 and bsgb2 brewery wastewaster bwgb3 and bwgb4 and food processing industry waste sludge fsgb5 and fsgb6 all microorganisms from three different waste sources were inoculated with a specific medium which is used for the growth of specific bacteria called geobactor metallireducence 32 3 1 morphological characteristics of microorganisms enriched on specific media microorganisms from different waste sources such as brewery wastewater brewery waste sludge and food processing industry waste sludge were grown in batch anaerobically all microorganisms from three different waste sources were inoculated with the prepared medium light microscopy images show a straight or slightly curved rod shaped in pars or chains with light pink colour for bacteria colonies isolated from three different sources indicating the gram negative nature fig 2 the microorganisms isolated from brewery waste sludge shown more biomass fig 2a compared with the microorganisms isolated from brewery wastewater and food processing industry waste sludge fig 2 b c the morphological characterization of isolated bacteria is presented in table 1 3 2 electricity generation from synthetic wastewater the anodic chambers of six constructed mfcs were inoculated with isolated bacterial from different waste sources separately generation of voltage from each mfc at fixed load of 1000 ω resistance was monitored in 1 h intervals for 18 days using a multi meter dl mult1999det except the bacteria isolated from food complex processing factory all mfc inoculated with bacteria isolated from brewery waste sources generated significant amount of voltage bacteria isolated from food complex processing factory waste sludge generates a maximum of only 0 005 v compared to others fig 3 c this is may be the geobacter specific media is not suitable for the microorganisms extracted from food complex processing factory and could not help to generate significance voltage from synthetic wastewater from the morphological analysis result it is shown that less colonies were observed by light microscope comparing with the microorganisms on the first day of inoculation bacteria isolated from brewery wastewater generated higher voltage 0 2 v compared to mfc inoculated with other bacteria on the second day of inoculation all bacteria isolated from brewery wastewater and brewery waste sludge started voltage generation in general bacterial isolates from brewery waste sludge generated higher voltage than bacterial isolates from brewery wastewater and food processing industry sludge sources the average voltage of 0 7 to 0 8 v was generated by bsgb2 isolate on the 5th to 11th day of inoculation however the generation of voltage was dramatically dropped after the 12th day of inoculation moreover bsgb1 isolate also showed gradually increase in production of voltage and its maximum production of voltage 0 75 v was recorded on the 18th day the current generation of the four mfcs inoculated with bacteria isolates from brewery wastewater and brewery waste sludge is shown in fig 3b for the maximum voltage of 0 8 v generated by bsgb2 the maximum current density of 1a m3 was recorded fig 3b comparing wastes from brewery factory bacteria isolated from brewery waste sludge outperformed the bacteria isolated from brewery wastewater this is may be geobacter specific media is compatible for the bacteria colony isolated from brewery waste sludge the maximum power density of 0 8 w m3 and 0 7 w m3 were generated by bsgb2 and bsgb1 respectively both isolated from brewery waste sludge fig 4 based on the performance of bacteria in synthetic wastewater two bacteria bsgb1 and bsgb2 isolates were selected to evaluate their performance in production of bioelectricity and treatment of real wastewater simultaneously 3 3 bio electricity generation from brewery wastewater since only two bacterial isolates from brewery waste sludge were outperform the other bacterial isolates gsbgb1 and gsgb2 were inoculated in mfc with real brewery wastewater for bio energy generation and operated batch mode for 28 days significant amount of bio electricity production was observed from brewery wastewater by both bacteria bsgb1 and bsgb2 fig 5 up to two days of inoculation generation of voltage was not noticed starting from the third day of inoculation voltage generation by mfc was steadily increased locally isolated bacteria gsbgb1 and gsgb2 were inoculated in anodic chamber and a very thin whitish biofilm formation was observed on the graphite rod that was used as anode in the constructed mfc this explains that the positive correlation exists in between the biofilm formation of geobacter on anode terminal with the time period this indicates that the biofilm self stabilized on the anode surface of carbon electrodes similarly it was reported that the growth of biofilm on the anode surface in mfc is of high importance for the steady current production and maintenance of voltage 37 generated average voltage and current density values were found to evolve over time till the stabilization of biofilm fig 5 significantly maximum voltage of 0 52 v 0 65 a m3 and 0 47 v 0 59a m3 were generated by bsgb1 and bsgb2 bacteria isolates respectively on 19th day of inoculation however after the 20th day of inoculation the voltage generation by bacteria isolates is declined indicating that the biomass bacterial growth is decreasing due to the lack of substrate energy source for the bacteria in the wastewater the initial rapid increase in production of voltage bioelectricity could be attributed to the presence of suitable nutrients organic matter that are easily utilized by bacteria this shows production of bioelectricity is directly proportional to the availability of organic matter in the wastewater which is used by bacterial isolates by which the production of bioelectricity take place and clearly indicates that as substrate utilization and degradation of organic matter rapidly leading to decreased in voltage these degraded products could be oxidized directly by electro active bacterial isolates from the real wastewater a maximum of 0 27 w m3 0 35 w m3 power density was generated by inoculating locally isolated bacteria bsgb1 and bsgb2 in home made mfc fig 6 the generation of power density starts to decline after the 20th day of inoculation confirming the degradation of organic matters by locally isolated microorganisms in the real brewery wastewater 3 4 degradation and removal nutrients from brewery wastewater the physicochemical properties of brewery wastewater were carried out before and after treated by bsgb1 and bsgb2 inoculated mfcs as shown in the table 2 bsgb1 and bsgb2 bacteria isolates played a key role in breaking down the nutrients i e organic matter most efficiently while generating bioelectricity leading to significant removal of cod and bod however there were no significant changes observed in the concentration of phosphate and nitrate indicating fermentation is a main process in this reaction whereas mfcs can generate bio energy from the organic matter and simultaneously removing carbon and nitrogen 4 38 39 the results clearly showed that the mfcs can be used for treating wastewater in ethiopia at the same time mfc can serve as alternative source for power generation as a reliable clean efficient device which employs renewable methods without generating any toxic by products therefore in the future mfcs can be a promising potential technology for recovery and in situ conversion of chemical energy into electricity 2 3 5 comparison of power generated with literature values comparisons of the values of voltage current density and power density generated by inoculating mfc with locally isolated microorganisms with others work reported in literature are summarized in table 3 the values of power density generated by mfcs innoculated with locally isolated microorganisms are comparable with the values reported literature values in this work the maximum power density generated by inoculating mfcs with locally isolated microorganisms is in the range of 276 350 mw m3 which was generated by microorganisms isolated from brewery waste sludge 4 conclusion in this work geobacter spp were locally isolated from three different waste sources brewery wastewater food processing industry waste sludge and brewery waste sludge and isolated bacteria were inoculated in microbial fuel cell and demonstrated for the first time in ethiopia for wastewater treatment and bio electricity generation this study concluded that mfcs innoculated with locally isolated microorganisms can be a sustainable and eco friendly technology for energy bioelectricity generation and simultaneous wastewater treatment with significant removal of cod bod and tds based on the morphological characterizations the better performing microorganisms with circular form of colony raised elevator and pink red color of colony were locally isolated from brewery waste sludge and remove more than 83 of cod from brewery wastewater the inoculated mfcs were able to generate power density of 350 mw m3 from brewery wastewater with the maximum cod bod tds removal efficiency of 79 83 67 70 and 76 78 respectively indicating significant treatment of brewery wastewater while generating sustainable and clean energy among locally isolated microorganisms microorganisms isolated from brewery waste sludge bsgb1 bsgb2 present better performance in electricity generation and wastewater treatment the probable reason is that bsgb1 bsgb2 microorganisms have got suitable conditions to grow in the wastewater compared to microorganisms isolated from brewery waste and food processing industry waste sludge therefore it is concluded that particularly for the treatment of brewery wastewater locally isolated microorganisms from the brewery waste sludge itself is more suitable than microorganisms isolated from the food processing waste sludge for green electricity generation and wastewater treatment simultaneously thus mfcs innoclulated with locally isolated microorganisms in the case of treatment of brewery wastewater will pave the way for minimising sustainable energy crisis and environmental pollution using microbial fuel cell technology author contributions l w negassa conceptualization experimental

13523,the separation behaviour and mass transfer mechanism of salicylic acid sa and two phenols by a polymer inclusion membrane pn pim based on polyvinyl chloride pvc as a base polymer and n n bis 1 methylheptanyl acetamide n503 as a carrier were studied the correlation between the effects of carrier content and membrane thickness on the morphology structure and mass transfer stability of pn pim was discussed pn pim presented a good mass transfer capability for sa and p nitrophenol pnp through a hydrogen transfer mechanism in weakly acidic environments and with low concentration naoh as a stripping phase the mass transfer rate was in accordance with the first order kinetic equation at ph 6 the phenol and pnp coexisting with sa can be selectively removed the mass transfer of pnp in pn pim was consistent with the diffusion mechanism whereas that of sa exhibited the characteristics of a fixed site hopping mechanism when the carrier content was 68 8 the permeability coefficient p of pnp and sa reached at 9 02 and 8 74 μm s respectively the mass transfer activation energies of pnp and sa totalled 13 23 and 19 08 kj mol respectively moreover intramembrane diffusion was the main controlling step of the mass transfer of pnp and sa in pn pim given the dual effects of pn pim membrane thickness on mass transfer stability and mass transfer rate the suitable thickness range of pn pim was 160 180 μm keywords salicylic acid polymer inclusion membrane n n bis 1 methylheptanyl acetamide selectivity stability 1 introduction salicylic acid sa is a representative and simplest aromatic phenolic acid which is an irreplaceable synthetic raw material for some conventional drugs 1 2 such as aspirin and glyburide and also a raw material or synthetic intermediate for food preservative 3 dye 4 and pesticide 5 because phenol is the raw material of sa the production wastewater of sa often contains a large number of high concentration phenols which has great resource recovery value 6 given their similar physical and chemical properties the separation and purification of aromatic phenolic acids such as salicylic acid and phenolic substances have become a representative research direction in the fields of organic synthesis fine chemicals chemical separation and analytical science 7 8 step by step extraction crystallisation and other methods are techniques for the separation and purification of conventional organic materials haensel et al 9 studied the selective extraction of sa in the form of free monomers and dimers in the aqueous phase using xylene as an extracting agent caro et al 10 studied the reaction crystallisation behaviour of sa through experiments and simulations however liquid liquid extraction and crystallisation which are widely used in the extraction and separation of high concentrations of products maybe unsuitable for the large scale separation and purification of several substances at low concentrations xie et al 11 used anion exchange resin to selectively adsorb sa and phenol from binary aqueous solution however the cost of ion exchange resin is high and its regeneration effect is poor so it is not suitable for wide application liu et al 12 prepared a novel molecularly imprinted polystyrene nanospheres composite alumina membrane mips cam by microemulsion polymerization method which has good recovery performance for phenol in industrial salicylic acid wastewater the phenol adsorption amount and the selectivity coefficients of mips cam to phenol increased with decreasing the particle sizes of mips nanospheres but molecularly imprinted membrane separation technology is still far from industrial applications 13 liquid membrane technology shows good application prospects in the separation of low concentration substances 14 sun et al 15 used a mixture of 20 tributyl phosphate and 80 kerosene as a liquid membrane phase to remove phenols from coal gasification wastewater with a polypropylene hollow fibre supported liquid membrane moamer et al 16 demonstrated the good extraction effect of using rapeseed oil as a membrane phase to remove phenol from wastewater in a semicontinuous permeation however supported liquid membrane and other liquid membranes are faced with the problems of poor stability polymer inclusion membrane pims based on cheap polyvinyl chloride pvc or cellulose triacetate is a highly selective separation method with simultaneous extraction and back extraction 17 18 pims feature convenient operation stable operation low energy consumption and easy industrial expansion without generating secondary pollution these membranes offer special advantages in dealing with separation problems encountered in low concentration and high background the separation of metal ions including the heavy metal ion chromium vi 19 20 and alkali metal ion caesium i 21 22 has been studied through pims in recent years several organic substances including phenol and aniline have been isolated through pim technology with good results 23 24 carrier to target substance recognition in pim is the process of mutual recognition through hydrogen bonding electrostatic complexation and coordination 25 26 given the protonation characteristics of aromatic phenols and acids their weak interaction through hydrogen bond proton transfer is the main mechanism for their recognition binding transport and dissociation in membranes however specific strong basic carriers will lose the selective recognition for phenols from acids due to the levelling effect and the similar chemical properties of aromatic phenols and aromatic acids n n bis 1 methylheptanyl acetamide n503 is an excellent carrier for pim because of its strong extraction capability high stability and low water solubility and volatility 27 the high electron cloud density of oxygen atoms which stems from the p π conjugation of nitrogen atoms and the acyloxy group in the amide structure facilitates protonation under acidic conditions and confers positive charges therefore pims can be used as a selective extractant of anions such as oxalate or the complex anions of metal ions 28 29 in addition under weakly acidic conditions the molecular state of n503 can form a hydrogen bond with a proton providing substance and be used as an extracting agent that contains a specific functional group 27 in view of the actual demand of the separation and purification of aromatic phenolic acid using salicylic acid as a model the separation behaviour of sa and phenol or pnp in aqueous phase was studied by polymer inclusion membrane pn pim containing n503 as carrier the mass transfer process and mechanism of sa and pnp through pn pim were discussed and the selective separation conditions of sa and phenol or pnp in pn pim system were obtained some problems related to the practical application of pn pim such as mass transfer stability were also investigated this study aimed to provide additional basic research data for the separation purification and removal of aromatic phenol and acid 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents pvc with a polymerisation degree of 2500 was purchased from beijing no 2 chemical plant n503 was obtained from shaoyang institute of chemical engineering sa and tetrahydrofuran thf were sourced from tianjin kemiou chemical reagent co ltd hydrochloric acid sodium hydroxide and pnp were procured from xi an chemical reagent factory all chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade 2 2 preparation of pn pim pn pim was prepared through solvent evaporation using thf as a solvent at 298 308 k 24 the samples were designated as pn pim37 50 pn pim50 00 pn pim64 28 pn pim68 80 and pn pim72 22 on the basis of the fraction of n503 in the pim the specific membrane composition is shown in table 1 the thickness of pn pim was measured by a spiral micrometre and presented as the average of five different points 2 3 characterisation of pn pim the chemical composition and interaction of pn pim were characterised by attenuated total internal reflection fourier transform infrared atr ftir american thermoelectric nicolet is50 the scanning wavelength range and accuracy were 4000 400 cm 1 and 4 cm 1 respectively the surface morphology of the membrane was studied through scanning electron microscopy sem japan jeol vega xmu with an accelerating voltage of 15 00 kv and 2000 magnification the membrane was plated with gold in vacuum the crystallisation behaviour of pn pim was analysed by x ray diffraction xrd science ultimanl v japan using a cu α k source with a scan range of 5 60 and a step size of 0 02 2 4 mass transfer behaviour of pn pim 2 4 1 mass transfer experiment the mass transfer of pnp was conducted in the apparatus shown in fig 1 the pim membrane was fixed between the feed phase and the stripping phase the effective mass transfer area was 3 14 cm2 and the mass transfer temperature was 303 k unless specified during mass transfer solutions of the two phases were magnetically stirred at 300 rpm a 0 5 ml sample was obtained from the feed and stripping phases every 2 h and 0 5 ml deionised water was added immediately the sample was diluted to 10 0 ml and the absorbance was measured by a uv spectrophotometer ne 300 thermo usa at 400 and 302 nm pnp and sa concentrations were determined through the standard curve method the transport of the target substance through pim during mass transfer conformed to a first order kinetic equation 30 31 and the concentration change in feed phase is in accordance with eq 1 1 in c 0 c t k t where c 0 refers to the initial concentration of feed phase c t denotes the concentration of the target substance in the feed phase at time t k is the rate constant h 1 t is the transmission time h the permeability coefficient of the target substance was calculated by applying eq 2 2 in c 0 c t a v p t where a is the effective membrane area and v is the volume of the two phase solution when the concentration of feed phase is constant the change in the initial flux j 0 can be expressed by permeability coefficient as shown in eq 3 3 j 0 p c 0 2 4 2 mass transfer thermodynamics the mass transfer activation energy ea of pnp and sa through pn pim was investigated between 293 and 323 k to confirm the rate controlling factor of pnp and sa mass transfer through pn pim in accordance with the arrhenius equation and eq 4 the ea during mass transfer was obtained by considering the logarithm of the initial flux j 0 and the reciprocal of the mass transfer thermodynamic temperature 1 t 4 lg j 0 e a 2 303 r t b in the equation ea is the mass transfer activation energy kj mol r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the temperature k and b is a constant 2 4 3 selectivity of pn pim the mixed solution of sa with phenol or pnp was used as the feed phase and different ph were set refer to the mass transfer experiment sampling and testing of 2 4 1 the concentrations of sa phenol and pnp in the mixed solution were determined through a dual wavelength ultraviolet spectrophotometric coefficient multiplication method see supplementary data figs s1 s4 for details the selective separation behaviour of substances 1 and 2 by pn pim can be evaluated on the basis of the separation factor s which is the initial flux of the mass transfer object as shown in eq 5 5 s substance substane 2 j 0 1 j 0 2 where j 0 1 and j 0 2 are the initial fluxes of substances 1 and 2 respectively 2 4 4 stability evaluation of pn pim 1 cyclic mass transfer experiment mass transfer experiments on pnp with five different thicknesses of pn pim68 8 in the range of 120 320 μm were performed in a continuous 23 h cycle the change of permeability coefficient over six continuous mass transfer cycles was investigated to evaluate the mass transfer stability of pn pim68 8 2 mass loss experiment pn pim68 8 was immersed in the feed and stripping phases 200 rpm constant temperature oscillation 303 1 k and 6 days under simulated mass transfer environmental conditions the membrane was taken out daily water on the membrane surface was absorbed by filter paper and weighed the mass loss rate was calculated in accordance with eq 6 the average of three parallel samples was obtained 6 η m 0 m t m 0 100 where m 0 is the mass of pim before immersion in the solution and m t is the mass of pim after immersion 3 results and discussion 3 1 composition and properties of pn pim fig 2 a shows the atr ftir spectrum of pn pim the figure shows that pn pim exhibited the out of plane bending and angular vibration absorptions of ch2 at 1253 and 958 cm 1 which belong to the carrier and matrix polymer respectively the vibration absorption of the c cl bond of pvc at 611 and 691 cm 1 decreased gradually with the increase in the n503 content of pn pim whereas n503 absorbed strong cn and co bonds at 1432 and 1641 cm 1 respectively low content pn pim30 and other membranes presented an intense blue shift indicating the strong dipole interaction between the carrier and polar functional groups of pvc fig 2 b presents the xrd pattern of pn pim when the content of n503 is 50 the two peaks of 2θ 17 5 and 24 5 combined to form a new peak at approximately 20 8 with the increase of the content of n503 the strength of the peak increases and the characteristic amorphous dispersion peak of pvc shifts to the low diffraction angle indicating that the stacked structure of pvc tends to disperse the above phenomenon implies the plasticising behaviour of n503 on pvc and the crystallinity of pn pim with high content carrier is low fig 2 c provides a surface sem photograph of pn pim as shown in fig 2 c the surface of pn pim with 50 n503 content was dense and uniform microporous structure appeared on the surface of pn pim when the n503 content exceeded 50 with the content of n503 increases the swelling degree of the polymer fiber bundle increases and the microporous gap increases the microstructure formed by plasticisation favoured the mass transfer 3 2 mass transfer behaviour of sa and pnp 3 2 1 kinetics of the mass transfer of sa and pnp fig 3 a illustrates the two phase changes in pn pim68 8 concentration during the mass transfer of pnp and sa the figure shows that pnp and sa underwent typical inverse concentration mass transfer in the two phases at 8 h this behaviour indicates that pn pim features an active transmission capacity for pnp and sa fig 3 b displays the linear fit of the logarithm in c 0 c t versus time t to the ratio of pnp and sa concentrations to the initial concentration in the feed phase the data show that the linear correlation coefficient between in c 0 c t and t exceeded 0 99 this result indicates that the mass transfer of pnp and sa in pn pim68 8 correspond to the first order kinetic rate equation 3 2 2 mass transfer conditions for sa and pnp fig 4 a and b illustrate the effect of the ph of the feed phase and alkali concentration of the stripping phase on the mass transfer capacity of sa and pnp transported by pn pim68 8 as depicted in fig 4 the mass transfer of pnp was relaxed for the environmental requirements of the feed phase but reached the highest at ph 3 a high mass transfer coefficient can be maintained over the range of ph 1 6 the sa for liquid environments follows strict requirements a ph 2 resulted in the best mass transfer effect the ph shows a considerable effect on the permeability coefficient when it exceeds 4 meanwhile when cnaoh is less than 0 1 mol l the permeability coefficients of sa and pnp decrease which may be due to the poor resolution ability of low cnaoh when cnaoh is more than 0 1 mol l the permeability coefficients of sa and pnp change little this indicates that high concentration of naoh will not effectively promote the mass transfer of sa and pnp because high concentration of naoh will lead to polymer matrix pvc chain breaking carrier emulsification and other side effects 25 32 which will reduce the stability of pn pim system thus affecting the mass transfer performance that is to say it is more suitable for sa and pnp to be resolved in weak alkaline solution after mass transfer by pn pim the two sets of data in fig 4 were analysed the pka of pnp was assumed to be 7 15 in the environment where the ph is lower than pka the molecular form of pnp yields a high distribution coefficient and can be used with the vector in pn pim n503 was bonded by hydrogen bonding as shown in eq 7 and the hydrogen bond and the body were destroyed in a strongly basic environment through dissociation the hydrogen bonding of pnp with n503 in a strongly acidic environment was reduced by protonation similarly for sa pka1 2 98 and pka2 13 66 the permeability coefficient at ph 1 is lower than that at ph 2 while at 4 ph 2 the permeability coefficient of sa decreases with the increase of ph and after ph 4 the permeability coefficient decreases to a very low level this is because in pn pim the mass transfer mechanism of carrier n503 and phenols through hydrogen bonding mechanism at 4 ph 2 the carboxyl group of sa is partially or completely deprotonated and sa forms intramolecular hydrogen bonds which reduces the number of hydrogen bonds between sa and n503 after ph 4 the phenolic hydroxyl group of sa lost the binding condition with n503 due to deprotonation however when the ph of the feed solution is less than 1 it will lead to the partial protonation of the acyl group of n503 which is not conducive to mass transfer both protonated carboxyl group and hydroxyl group can form hydrogen bond complexes with the carbonyl group in n503 the carbonyl oxygen bond in n503 formed a hydrogen bond complex as shown in eq 8 therefore the ph environment of the feed phase drastically affected the mass transfer of sa 3 3 mass transfer mechanisms of sa and pnp fig 5 a shows the effect of n503 content on the mass transfer of pnp and sa in the pn pim system the figure shows that the mass transfer of both substances in the pn pim system slightly differed the permeability coefficient of pnp increased uniformly with the increase in n503 content and that of sa exhibited a dramatic jump after the n503 content exceeded 50 the mass transfer of sa by pn pim appeared percolation threshold with the increase of carrier n503 content therefore the mass transfer of sa by pn pim followed the fixed site hopping mechanism on the contrary it is carrier diffusion mechanism for pnp 33 this difference is caused by the different functional groups of the two substances the penetration capability of sa may be related to the oh and cooh functional groups which can form hydrogen bonds with n503 when the carrier amount is low sa binds only to n503 with a hydrogen bond competitive carboxyl group and when the amount of the carrier increases and exceeds the threshold both functional groups of sa can participate in hydrogen bonding complexation and behaviour with the n503 and contribute to mass transfer therefore the permeability coefficient suddenly increased and exceeded the penetration capability of pn pim to pnp when the carrier content of pn pim exceeded 70 the permeability coefficient of pn pim72 2 does not decrease however when the carrier content of pn pim is higher than 68 8 e g 72 2 the mechanical properties of pn pim are low due to the superplasticization of n503 to pvc 24 and the mass transfer performance is unstable due to the high viscosity in the membrane therefore pn pim68 8 was selected as the most suitable membrane material for the subsequent research fig 5 b illustrates the thermodynamics of the mass transfer of pnp and sa in the pn pim68 8 system the mass transfer of pnp and sa through pn pim68 8 can be obtained by applying eq 4 in accordance with the slope value of the curve obtained by the relationship between the logarithm of the initial flux j 0 and the reciprocal of temperature 1 t the activation energies reached 13 23 and 19 08 kj mol on the basis of the criteria for judging the main controlling factors of ea value and mass transfer rate provided in previous references for diffusion controlled processes the activation energy values are lower than 20 kj mol while those for processes controlled by chemical reaction are higher than 42 kj mol in the case when the activation energy values are in the range from 20 to 42 kj mol the transport processes are controllable by both diffusion and chemical reaction 19 therefore the diffusion step in pn pim is the main controlling factor for the mass transfer of pnp and sa meanwhile the energy barriers of hydrogen bonding and dissociation between pnp sa and n503 were low and the rate of pn pim mass transfer sa and pnp was minimal the combined experimental results and analysis indicate that the mass transfer mechanism of pnp and sa in the pn pim system is based on hydrogen bonding between these compounds and the carrier and codirectional transport is caused by the deviation of h concentration in the two phases the schematic diagram of coupled mass transfer process is shown in fig 6 3 4 selective separation of sa from phenol and pnp the selective mass transfer of sa pnp and sa phenol mixtures were carried out by pn pim under three different ph conditions 2 4 6 respectively the results show that after nearly 24 h of mass transfer the permeability coefficients of sa and pnp phenol are about 8 times different at ph 6 and only less than 10 of sa has achieved mass transfer while pnp and phenol are close to complete mass transfer see supplementary data fig s5 for details the result is related to the intramolecular hydrogen bond of sa at ph 6 this is consistent with the experimental results in section 3 2 2 and the research results in the literature 24 on the mass transfer of phenol through pn pim it also shows that under this condition sa has good separation behaviour between pnp and phenol table 2 shows the selective separation behaviour of the binary mixture of sa and pnp phenol at different ph conditions and relative initial concentrations ph is the key factor for the selective separation of sa and two phenols at ph 6 0 the separation factors of pnp phenol and sa were 8 88 and 7 54 respectively when csa cx increased sx sa gradually decreased however even when csa cx is 10 1 spnp sa and sphenol sa can still reach 6 46 and 5 40 the results show that pn pim has a good selective separation behaviour between sa and pnp phenol 3 5 stability of pn pim sa was used as the mass transfer object and the relationship between pn pim68 8 membrane thickness and stability was investigated through periodic cyclic mass transfer experiment through the mass loss experiment the mass loss rate of pn pim68 8 in two phase solution environment was investigated to confirm the loss of carrier in the mass transfer process and then to prove the stability of pn pim 1 periodic cycle mass transfer experiment fig 7 shows the permeability coefficient and its variation with pnp over six mass transfer cycles using pn pim68 8 with different membrane thicknesses the figure shows that the thickness of pn pim68 8 and the permeability coefficient of the first cycle failed to fully conform to the inverse relationship given by fick s diffusion law and the permeability coefficient of pn pim68 8 with varying thicknesses decreased differently in the mass transfer cycle the mass transfer coefficient of the thin pim 125 μm showed a high declining rate thick membranes 220 and 320 μm showed low permeability coefficient values during the first cycle but exhibited slight attenuations in subsequent cycles the permeability coefficient was the highest at 180 μm thickness reaching 11 61 μm s and remaining stable over six mass transfer cycles with negligible change 2 mass loss experiment the mass loss rate of pn pim with different thicknesses in the simulated two phase solution

state of pn pim and the brittle white matter of the pn pim68 8 membrane after immersion in the alkaline stripping phase c fig 8 reveals the mass loss rate and change in appearance of pn pim68 8 with different thicknesses before and after 6 days of soaking in the stripping phase according to the data the mass loss rate of the membranes with thicknesses of 160 and 180 μm was the lowest at less than 5 whereas that of the thin membrane 125 μm or thick membrane 220 320 μm exceeded 6 5 based on the relationship between the mass loss rate and carrier density in the membrane shown in fig 8 the mass loss rate of pn pim with the same carrier content and different thicknesses is related to the carrier density in the unit area of pim at the same time the mass loss of pim occurred mainly in the initial stage within the first day the correlation between the pim thickness and stability needs to be discussed in detail however the experimental results in this study show that appropriate film thickness is also an important aspect of optimising the mass transfer conditions of pim 4 conclusions sa and pnp demonstrate good mass transfer and separation effects by adjusting the ph of feed phase

13523,the separation behaviour and mass transfer mechanism of salicylic acid sa and two phenols by a polymer inclusion membrane pn pim based on polyvinyl chloride pvc as a base polymer and n n bis 1 methylheptanyl acetamide n503 as a carrier were studied the correlation between the effects of carrier content and membrane thickness on the morphology structure and mass transfer stability of pn pim was discussed pn pim presented a good mass transfer capability for sa and p nitrophenol pnp through a hydrogen transfer mechanism in weakly acidic environments and with low concentration naoh as a stripping phase the mass transfer rate was in accordance with the first order kinetic equation at ph 6 the phenol and pnp coexisting with sa can be selectively removed the mass transfer of pnp in pn pim was consistent with the diffusion mechanism whereas that of sa exhibited the characteristics of a fixed site hopping mechanism when the carrier content was 68 8 the permeability coefficient p of pnp and sa reached at 9 02 and 8 74 μm s respectively the mass transfer activation energies of pnp and sa totalled 13 23 and 19 08 kj mol respectively moreover intramembrane diffusion was the main controlling step of the mass transfer of pnp and sa in pn pim given the dual effects of pn pim membrane thickness on mass transfer stability and mass transfer rate the suitable thickness range of pn pim was 160 180 μm keywords salicylic acid polymer inclusion membrane n n bis 1 methylheptanyl acetamide selectivity stability 1 introduction salicylic acid sa is a representative and simplest aromatic phenolic acid which is an irreplaceable synthetic raw material for some conventional drugs 1 2 such as aspirin and glyburide and also a raw material or synthetic intermediate for food preservative 3 dye 4 and pesticide 5 because phenol is the raw material of sa the production wastewater of sa often contains a large number of high concentration phenols which has great resource recovery value 6 given their similar physical and chemical properties the separation and purification of aromatic phenolic acids such as salicylic acid and phenolic substances have become a representative research direction in the fields of organic synthesis fine chemicals chemical separation and analytical science 7 8 step by step extraction crystallisation and other methods are techniques for the separation and purification of conventional organic materials haensel et al 9 studied the selective extraction of sa in the form of free monomers and dimers in the aqueous phase using xylene as an extracting agent caro et al 10 studied the reaction crystallisation behaviour of sa through experiments and simulations however liquid liquid extraction and crystallisation which are widely used in the extraction and separation of high concentrations of products maybe unsuitable for the large scale separation and purification of several substances at low concentrations xie et al 11 used anion exchange resin to selectively adsorb sa and phenol from binary aqueous solution however the cost of ion exchange resin is high and its regeneration effect is poor so it is not suitable for wide application liu et al 12 prepared a novel molecularly imprinted polystyrene nanospheres composite alumina membrane mips cam by microemulsion polymerization method which has good recovery performance for phenol in industrial salicylic acid wastewater the phenol adsorption amount and the selectivity coefficients of mips cam to phenol increased with decreasing the particle sizes of mips nanospheres but molecularly imprinted membrane separation technology is still far from industrial applications 13 liquid membrane technology shows good application prospects in the separation of low concentration substances 14 sun et al 15 used a mixture of 20 tributyl phosphate and 80 kerosene as a liquid membrane phase to remove phenols from coal gasification wastewater with a polypropylene hollow fibre supported liquid membrane moamer et al 16 demonstrated the good extraction effect of using rapeseed oil as a membrane phase to remove phenol from wastewater in a semicontinuous permeation however supported liquid membrane and other liquid membranes are faced with the problems of poor stability polymer inclusion membrane pims based on cheap polyvinyl chloride pvc or cellulose triacetate is a highly selective separation method with simultaneous extraction and back extraction 17 18 pims feature convenient operation stable operation low energy consumption and easy industrial expansion without generating secondary pollution these membranes offer special advantages in dealing with separation problems encountered in low concentration and high background the separation of metal ions including the heavy metal ion chromium vi 19 20 and alkali metal ion caesium i 21 22 has been studied through pims in recent years several organic substances including phenol and aniline have been isolated through pim technology with good results 23 24 carrier to target substance recognition in pim is the process of mutual recognition through hydrogen bonding electrostatic complexation and coordination 25 26 given the protonation characteristics of aromatic phenols and acids their weak interaction through hydrogen bond proton transfer is the main mechanism for their recognition binding transport and dissociation in membranes however specific strong basic carriers will lose the selective recognition for phenols from acids due to the levelling effect and the similar chemical properties of aromatic phenols and aromatic acids n n bis 1 methylheptanyl acetamide n503 is an excellent carrier for pim because of its strong extraction capability high stability and low water solubility and volatility 27 the high electron cloud density of oxygen atoms which stems from the p π conjugation of nitrogen atoms and the acyloxy group in the amide structure facilitates protonation under acidic conditions and confers positive charges therefore pims can be used as a selective extractant of anions such as oxalate or the complex anions of metal ions 28 29 in addition under weakly acidic conditions the molecular state of n503 can form a hydrogen bond with a proton providing substance and be used as an extracting agent that contains a specific functional group 27 in view of the actual demand of the separation and purification of aromatic phenolic acid using salicylic acid as a model the separation behaviour of sa and phenol or pnp in aqueous phase was studied by polymer inclusion membrane pn pim containing n503 as carrier the mass transfer process and mechanism of sa and pnp through pn pim were discussed and the selective separation conditions of sa and phenol or pnp in pn pim system were obtained some problems related to the practical application of pn pim such as mass transfer stability were also investigated this study aimed to provide additional basic research data for the separation purification and removal of aromatic phenol and acid 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents pvc with a polymerisation degree of 2500 was purchased from beijing no 2 chemical plant n503 was obtained from shaoyang institute of chemical engineering sa and tetrahydrofuran thf were sourced from tianjin kemiou chemical reagent co ltd hydrochloric acid sodium hydroxide and pnp were procured from xi an chemical reagent factory all chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade 2 2 preparation of pn pim pn pim was prepared through solvent evaporation using thf as a solvent at 298 308 k 24 the samples were designated as pn pim37 50 pn pim50 00 pn pim64 28 pn pim68 80 and pn pim72 22 on the basis of the fraction of n503 in the pim the specific membrane composition is shown in table 1 the thickness of pn pim was measured by a spiral micrometre and presented as the average of five different points 2 3 characterisation of pn pim the chemical composition and interaction of pn pim were characterised by attenuated total internal reflection fourier transform infrared atr ftir american thermoelectric nicolet is50 the scanning wavelength range and accuracy were 4000 400 cm 1 and 4 cm 1 respectively the surface morphology of the membrane was studied through scanning electron microscopy sem japan jeol vega xmu with an accelerating voltage of 15 00 kv and 2000 magnification the membrane was plated with gold in vacuum the crystallisation behaviour of pn pim was analysed by x ray diffraction xrd science ultimanl v japan using a cu α k source with a scan range of 5 60 and a step size of 0 02 2 4 mass transfer behaviour of pn pim 2 4 1 mass transfer experiment the mass transfer of pnp was conducted in the apparatus shown in fig 1 the pim membrane was fixed between the feed phase and the stripping phase the effective mass transfer area was 3 14 cm2 and the mass transfer temperature was 303 k unless specified during mass transfer solutions of the two phases were magnetically stirred at 300 rpm a 0 5 ml sample was obtained from the feed and stripping phases every 2 h and 0 5 ml deionised water was added immediately the sample was diluted to 10 0 ml and the absorbance was measured by a uv spectrophotometer ne 300 thermo usa at 400 and 302 nm pnp and sa concentrations were determined through the standard curve method the transport of the target substance through pim during mass transfer conformed to a first order kinetic equation 30 31 and the concentration change in feed phase is in accordance with eq 1 1 in c 0 c t k t where c 0 refers to the initial concentration of feed phase c t denotes the concentration of the target substance in the feed phase at time t k is the rate constant h 1 t is the transmission time h the permeability coefficient of the target substance was calculated by applying eq 2 2 in c 0 c t a v p t where a is the effective membrane area and v is the volume of the two phase solution when the concentration of feed phase is constant the change in the initial flux j 0 can be expressed by permeability coefficient as shown in eq 3 3 j 0 p c 0 2 4 2 mass transfer thermodynamics the mass transfer activation energy ea of pnp and sa through pn pim was investigated between 293 and 323 k to confirm the rate controlling factor of pnp and sa mass transfer through pn pim in accordance with the arrhenius equation and eq 4 the ea during mass transfer was obtained by considering the logarithm of the initial flux j 0 and the reciprocal of the mass transfer thermodynamic temperature 1 t 4 lg j 0 e a 2 303 r t b in the equation ea is the mass transfer activation energy kj mol r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the temperature k and b is a constant 2 4 3 selectivity of pn pim the mixed solution of sa with phenol or pnp was used as the feed phase and different ph were set refer to the mass transfer experiment sampling and testing of 2 4 1 the concentrations of sa phenol and pnp in the mixed solution were determined through a dual wavelength ultraviolet spectrophotometric coefficient multiplication method see supplementary data figs s1 s4 for details the selective separation behaviour of substances 1 and 2 by pn pim can be evaluated on the basis of the separation factor s which is the initial flux of the mass transfer object as shown in eq 5 5 s substance substane 2 j 0 1 j 0 2 where j 0 1 and j 0 2 are the initial fluxes of substances 1 and 2 respectively 2 4 4 stability evaluation of pn pim 1 cyclic mass transfer experiment mass transfer experiments on pnp with five different thicknesses of pn pim68 8 in the range of 120 320 μm were performed in a continuous 23 h cycle the change of permeability coefficient over six continuous mass transfer cycles was investigated to evaluate the mass transfer stability of pn pim68 8 2 mass loss experiment pn pim68 8 was immersed in the feed and stripping phases 200 rpm constant temperature oscillation 303 1 k and 6 days under simulated mass transfer environmental conditions the membrane was taken out daily water on the membrane surface was absorbed by filter paper and weighed the mass loss rate was calculated in accordance with eq 6 the average of three parallel samples was obtained 6 η m 0 m t m 0 100 where m 0 is the mass of pim before immersion in the solution and m t is the mass of pim after immersion 3 results and discussion 3 1 composition and properties of pn pim fig 2 a shows the atr ftir spectrum of pn pim the figure shows that pn pim exhibited the out of plane bending and angular vibration absorptions of ch2 at 1253 and 958 cm 1 which belong to the carrier and matrix polymer respectively the vibration absorption of the c cl bond of pvc at 611 and 691 cm 1 decreased gradually with the increase in the n503 content of pn pim whereas n503 absorbed strong cn and co bonds at 1432 and 1641 cm 1 respectively low content pn pim30 and other membranes presented an intense blue shift indicating the strong dipole interaction between the carrier and polar functional groups of pvc fig 2 b presents the xrd pattern of pn pim when the content of n503 is 50 the two peaks of 2θ 17 5 and 24 5 combined to form a new peak at approximately 20 8 with the increase of the content of n503 the strength of the peak increases and the characteristic amorphous dispersion peak of pvc shifts to the low diffraction angle indicating that the stacked structure of pvc tends to disperse the above phenomenon implies the plasticising behaviour of n503 on pvc and the crystallinity of pn pim with high content carrier is low fig 2 c provides a surface sem photograph of pn pim as shown in fig 2 c the surface of pn pim with 50 n503 content was dense and uniform microporous structure appeared on the surface of pn pim when the n503 content exceeded 50 with the content of n503 increases the swelling degree of the polymer fiber bundle increases and the microporous gap increases the microstructure formed by plasticisation favoured the mass transfer 3 2 mass transfer behaviour of sa and pnp 3 2 1 kinetics of the mass transfer of sa and pnp fig 3 a illustrates the two phase changes in pn pim68 8 concentration during the mass transfer of pnp and sa the figure shows that pnp and sa underwent typical inverse concentration mass transfer in the two phases at 8 h this behaviour indicates that pn pim features an active transmission capacity for pnp and sa fig 3 b displays the linear fit of the logarithm in c 0 c t versus time t to the ratio of pnp and sa concentrations to the initial concentration in the feed phase the data show that the linear correlation coefficient between in c 0 c t and t exceeded 0 99 this result indicates that the mass transfer of pnp and sa in pn pim68 8 correspond to the first order kinetic rate equation 3 2 2 mass transfer conditions for sa and pnp fig 4 a and b illustrate the effect of the ph of the feed phase and alkali concentration of the stripping phase on the mass transfer capacity of sa and pnp transported by pn pim68 8 as depicted in fig 4 the mass transfer of pnp was relaxed for the environmental requirements of the feed phase but reached the highest at ph 3 a high mass transfer coefficient can be maintained over the range of ph 1 6 the sa for liquid environments follows strict requirements a ph 2 resulted in the best mass transfer effect the ph shows a considerable effect on the permeability coefficient when it exceeds 4 meanwhile when cnaoh is less than 0 1 mol l the permeability coefficients of sa and pnp decrease which may be due to the poor resolution ability of low cnaoh when cnaoh is more than 0 1 mol l the permeability coefficients of sa and pnp change little this indicates that high concentration of naoh will not effectively promote the mass transfer of sa and pnp because high concentration of naoh will lead to polymer matrix pvc chain breaking carrier emulsification and other side effects 25 32 which will reduce the stability of pn pim system thus affecting the mass transfer performance that is to say it is more suitable for sa and pnp to be resolved in weak alkaline solution after mass transfer by pn pim the two sets of data in fig 4 were analysed the pka of pnp was assumed to be 7 15 in the environment where the ph is lower than pka the molecular form of pnp yields a high distribution coefficient and can be used with the vector in pn pim n503 was bonded by hydrogen bonding as shown in eq 7 and the hydrogen bond and the body were destroyed in a strongly basic environment through dissociation the hydrogen bonding of pnp with n503 in a strongly acidic environment was reduced by protonation similarly for sa pka1 2 98 and pka2 13 66 the permeability coefficient at ph 1 is lower than that at ph 2 while at 4 ph 2 the permeability coefficient of sa decreases with the increase of ph and after ph 4 the permeability coefficient decreases to a very low level this is because in pn pim the mass transfer mechanism of carrier n503 and phenols through hydrogen bonding mechanism at 4 ph 2 the carboxyl group of sa is partially or completely deprotonated and sa forms intramolecular hydrogen bonds which reduces the number of hydrogen bonds between sa and n503 after ph 4 the phenolic hydroxyl group of sa lost the binding condition with n503 due to deprotonation however when the ph of the feed solution is less than 1 it will lead to the partial protonation of the acyl group of n503 which is not conducive to mass transfer both protonated carboxyl group and hydroxyl group can form hydrogen bond complexes with the carbonyl group in n503 the carbonyl oxygen bond in n503 formed a hydrogen bond complex as shown in eq 8 therefore the ph environment of the feed phase drastically affected the mass transfer of sa 3 3 mass transfer mechanisms of sa and pnp fig 5 a shows the effect of n503 content on the mass transfer of pnp and sa in the pn pim system the figure shows that the mass transfer of both substances in the pn pim system slightly differed the permeability coefficient of pnp increased uniformly with the increase in n503 content and that of sa exhibited a dramatic jump after the n503 content exceeded 50 the mass transfer of sa by pn pim appeared percolation threshold with the increase of carrier n503 content therefore the mass transfer of sa by pn pim followed the fixed site hopping mechanism on the contrary it is carrier diffusion mechanism for pnp 33 this difference is caused by the different functional groups of the two substances the penetration capability of sa may be related to the oh and cooh functional groups which can form hydrogen bonds with n503 when the carrier amount is low sa binds only to n503 with a hydrogen bond competitive carboxyl group and when the amount of the carrier increases and exceeds the threshold both functional groups of sa can participate in hydrogen bonding complexation and behaviour with the n503 and contribute to mass transfer therefore the permeability coefficient suddenly increased and exceeded the penetration capability of pn pim to pnp when the carrier content of pn pim exceeded 70 the permeability coefficient of pn pim72 2 does not decrease however when the carrier content of pn pim is higher than 68 8 e g 72 2 the mechanical properties of pn pim are low due to the superplasticization of n503 to pvc 24 and the mass transfer performance is unstable due to the high viscosity in the membrane therefore pn pim68 8 was selected as the most suitable membrane material for the subsequent research fig 5 b illustrates the thermodynamics of the mass transfer of pnp and sa in the pn pim68 8 system the mass transfer of pnp and sa through pn pim68 8 can be obtained by applying eq 4 in accordance with the slope value of the curve obtained by the relationship between the logarithm of the initial flux j 0 and the reciprocal of temperature 1 t the activation energies reached 13 23 and 19 08 kj mol on the basis of the criteria for judging the main controlling factors of ea value and mass transfer rate provided in previous references for diffusion controlled processes the activation energy values are lower than 20 kj mol while those for processes controlled by chemical reaction are higher than 42 kj mol in the case when the activation energy values are in the range from 20 to 42 kj mol the transport processes are controllable by both diffusion and chemical reaction 19 therefore the diffusion step in pn pim is the main controlling factor for the mass transfer of pnp and sa meanwhile the energy barriers of hydrogen bonding and dissociation between pnp sa and n503 were low and the rate of pn pim mass transfer sa and pnp was minimal the combined experimental results and analysis indicate that the mass transfer mechanism of pnp and sa in the pn pim system is based on hydrogen bonding between these compounds and the carrier and codirectional transport is caused by the deviation of h concentration in the two phases the schematic diagram of coupled mass transfer process is shown in fig 6 3 4 selective separation of sa from phenol and pnp the selective mass transfer of sa pnp and sa phenol mixtures were carried out by pn pim under three different ph conditions 2 4 6 respectively the results show that after nearly 24 h of mass transfer the permeability coefficients of sa and pnp phenol are about 8 times different at ph 6 and only less than 10 of sa has achieved mass transfer while pnp and phenol are close to complete mass transfer see supplementary data fig s5 for details the result is related to the intramolecular hydrogen bond of sa at ph 6 this is consistent with the experimental results in section 3 2 2 and the research results in the literature 24 on the mass transfer of phenol through pn pim it also shows that under this condition sa has good separation behaviour between pnp and phenol table 2 shows the selective separation behaviour of the binary mixture of sa and pnp phenol at different ph conditions and relative initial concentrations ph is the key factor for the selective separation of sa and two phenols at ph 6 0 the separation factors of pnp phenol and sa were 8 88 and 7 54 respectively when csa cx increased sx sa gradually decreased however even when csa cx is 10 1 spnp sa and sphenol sa can still reach 6 46 and 5 40 the results show that pn pim has a good selective separation behaviour between sa and pnp phenol 3 5 stability of pn pim sa was used as the mass transfer object and the relationship between pn pim68 8 membrane thickness and stability was investigated through periodic cyclic mass transfer experiment through the mass loss experiment the mass loss rate of pn pim68 8 in two phase solution environment was investigated to confirm the loss of carrier in the mass transfer process and then to prove the stability of pn pim 1 periodic cycle

13524,water is an essential ingredient in wine production the winery plant considered in this study located in the langhe area piedmont nw italy used approx 100 000 m3 per year of high quality water for cleaning and sanitation operations water was collected from the local shallow aquifer and contained high concentrations of dissolved iron fe ii 800 3500 μg l and manganese mn ii 300 700 μg l the water treatment plant wtp owned by the winery included a series of treatment processes air sparging and sodium hypochlorite injection settling filtration on a quartzite pyrolusite filter removal of excess chlorine with an activated carbon filter and finally microfiltration and reverse osmosis ro that were deemed to be adequate to make the groundwater compliant with potable uses however a survey carried out by the authors revealed the presence of two critical issues in the wtp s management concerning the fe ii and mn ii oxidation and removal and the backwashing of the dual media filter firstly the results of pilot tests demonstrated that the process of air sparging was sufficient for the oxidation of iron and that naclo was not necessary for that operation the present concentration of pure oxidant of 21 5 mg naclo l could be reduced by at least 75 without altering the capacity of the wtp in the removal of the two metals secondly a new combination of water fluxes could improve the efficiency of the dual media filter backwashing thus allowing to simultaneously avoid the use of the ro corrosive concentrate and to minimize the use of high quality water in the end a very basic cost model was used to compare the unit cost for water treatment in the current scenario and after the introduction of the two proposed solutions specifically that model considered three cost items operating costs that included four sub items mortgage maintenance consulting and cost for non amortizable raw materials and consumable the costs for the purchase of the chemicals necessary for the water treatment process and the energy costs the results coming from the application of the cost model demonstrated that the introduction of the proposed solutions into the wtp at no additional costs had an undeniable positive impact on the final unit cost of the treated water that was reduced by 20 keywords groundwater treatment iron manganese oxidation dual media filtration air sparging treatment cost energy consumption 1 introduction the langhe a hilly area located in the piedmont region nw italy is well known for the production of wines and sparkling wines appreciated all over the world that area was inscribed on the unesco s world heritage list in 2014 even because of the recognized value of such an area great efforts are necessary to enhance the environmental sustainability of the wines production processes water other than a precious natural resource for the survival and well being of humans and the ecosystem is an essential ingredient in wine production in fact it must support grape vine grown and fructification in the field and cleaning and sanitation processes of bottles and pieces of equipment in the winery recent studies have revealed that the water footprint of wine was in the order of 800 l of waters l of wine 1 that value came from both agricultural operations and winery processes for the latter ones it was reported that the production of 1 l of wine required 6 l of water with estimates that varied from as little as 2 l up to 20 l 2 3 consequently even in a winery an efficient and rationale usage of water is of primary concern to achieve a high degree of sustainability for wines production processes in most cases the water used for cleaning and sanitation processes in a winery comes from a dedicated water treatment plant wtp that collects raw water from the local deep or superficial water sources and makes it suitable for the winery operations in the case of the wine factory considered in this study the raw water came from a shallow aquifer and contained concentrations of dissolved iron fe ii and manganese mn ii such high as to make it unsuitable for cleaning and sanitation processes according to the italian regulation concerning the water intended for human consumption d lgs 31 01 in fact the concentration ranges of iron and manganese in the raw groundwater used by the winery were 800 3500 μg l and 300 700 μg l respectively with respect to the threshold values of 200 μg l for iron and 50 μg l for manganese fixed by d lgs 31 01 iron and manganese are quite widespread in most of the italian groundwaters 4 both in the langhe area and outside of the piedmont region 5 6 iron and manganese in waters have been recognized as the cause of aesthetic and operating issues such as discoloration of water staining of laundry and plumbing fixtures metallic taste and odor and scaling of pipes 7 furthermore recent studies reported that a manganese intake from water ingestion even at low levels may lead to intellectual impairment in children 8 as well as other neurological disorders 9 ferrous iron can be oxidized quickly by oxygen under controlled conditions particularly at alkaline ph only occasionally fe ii is complexed by natural organic matter nom to the degree that oxygen is unable to oxidize it in a reasonable time 10 after oxidation iron can be separated from water through settling or granular media filtration 11 conversely the conventional oxidation of mn ii through oxygen is very scarcely effective and the use of free chlorine or other stronger oxidants presents a series of drawbacks i free chlorine even at ph values of 8 0 or higher required several hours of contact and consequently large volume reactors to oxidize mn ii ii the oxidation efficiency of stronger oxidants such as ozone or potassium permanganate depends on a series of factors namely ph temperature initial dissolved manganese concentration contact time and presence of nom iii the presence of high concentrations of nom could cause pink water generation when potassium permanganate is used iv the oxidation of mn ii could form stabilized colloids with a high negative charge that are difficult to be separated by granular filtration but that could severely foul microfiltration or ultrafiltration membranes 12 for all the above listed reasons specific treatments are required for the removal of mn ii from groundwater it was recognized that the combined processes of adsorption and oxidation of mn ii onto manganese oxide mnox s coated media also known as natural greensand effect nge process was an effective and economic method for mn ii removal in the nge process mn ii is adsorbed onto the mnox s coating and then oxidized by chlorine at a neutral ph value thus creating additional mnox s 13 the use of pyrolusite as an adsorbing medium has shown a number of benefits in comparison with contactors containing mnox s coated sand in fact pyrolusite is a natural manganese ore consisting of more than 80 mno2 it has high density of adsorption sites and finally because of its specific gravity in the order of 5 it guarantees reduced particle entrainment and adequate media separation when a dual media granular filter e g quartzite pyrolusite is used 14 15 the wtp belonging to the winery considered in this study was originally designed and built with the aim of removing iron manganese and total hardness due to the presence of high amounts of calcium and magnesium into the groundwater that made the collected groundwater not suitable for cleaning processes of bottles tanks and pieces of equipment the wtp includes the processes of oxidation with air and chlorine settling filtration on a granular dual media quartzite pyrolusite filter removal of excess chlorine through adsorption on an activated carbon filter and finally microfiltration and reverse osmosis ro even in the light of the considerations reported above concerning the best techniques for iron and manganese removal the combination of the operations performed in the wtp was deemed to be adequate for iron manganese and total hardness removal however a survey carried out by the authors on the wtp revealed the presence of some critical issues those issues seemed to be mainly related to an apparent excessive amount of chemicals used for the treatment operations and to the maintenance of the main pieces of equipment of the wtp consequently several survey campaigns were carried out to collect information concerning the quality of the water at the inlet and at the outlet of the wtp the characteristics of the pieces of equipment used in the wtp their energy consumption and the type and amount of chemicals used for the water treatment processes the gathered information was used i to identify the critical issues connected to the water treatment process ii to propose solutions for the optimization of the process and finally iii to quantify the economic impact coming from the introduction of the proposed solutions on the final unit cost of the treated water 2 materials and methods 2 1 groundwater quality the winery used approx 100 000 m3 of water per year for operations of cleaning and sanitation of bottles tanks and pieces of equipment the water demand of the winery was satisfied with the groundwater collected from the local shallow aquifer through three wells namely well n 1 n 2 and n 3 well n 1 and well n 3 were very close the one to the other conversely well n 2 was 50 m distant from wells n 1 and n 3 the characteristics of the three wells are shown in table 1 two pipes carried the groundwater from the wells to the inlet of the wtp one pipe conveyed the mixture of the groundwater collected from wells n 1 and n 3 the other pipe conveyed the groundwater collected from well n 2 the winery carried out periodic sampling campaigns at the outlet of each of the two pipes to monitor the quality of the water conveyed by the two pipes separately an external certified laboratory has assessed the quality of the groundwater through the analysis of the following parameters ph electrical conductivity ec chloride sulfate nitrogen compounds ammonium nitrite nitrate earth alkali metals calcium magnesium and total hardness metals and heavy metals fe mn as cd cr hg ni pb cu se and biological parameters total coliforms escherichia coli enterococci the results of the analyses carried out on the groundwater collected from wells n 1 and n 3 and from well n 2 in the period 2015 2017 are detailed in table 2 from the values of table 2 it can be seen that iron and manganese were the most critical compounds because their concentrations exceeded the threshold values fixed by italian d lgs 31 01 in almost all of the sampling dates in fact the concentrations of iron and manganese in the groundwater from wells n 1 and n 3 were 3 4 times higher than the threshold values of 200 and 50 μg l respectively and those in the groundwater from well n 2 were even 15 20 times higher furthermore the quality of the groundwater collected from wells n 1 and n 3 was on average superior to that collected from well n 2 specifically the average 2015 2017 concentration of iron in well n 2 was five times higher than that found in wells n 1 and n 3 3306 μg l vs 634 μg l and the concentration of manganese was two times higher 611 μg l vs 322 μg l finally the concentrations of iron and manganese in the two wells in the last two years 2016 2017 were at almost constant values other than iron and manganese also chloride and total hardness deserved special attention in fact the average concentration of chloride was 193 mg l in wells n 1 and n 3 and 207 mg l in well n 2 respectively while the threshold value was at 250 mg l the average total hardness was approx 51 f in wells n 1 and n 3 and of more than 60 f in the waters of well n 2 there are no threshold values for total hardness fixed by the italian law that regulates drinking water but the groundwater of that site was found to be very hard thus exceeding the upper limit of the range 15 50 f recommended for household or industrial uses 2 2 water treatment plant description the wtp owned by the winery was originally designed with the aim of removing those compounds namely iron manganese and earth alkali metals calcium magnesium that made the collected groundwater not suitable for household or industrial uses the yearly average volume of the water treated in the wtp was in the order of 130 000 m3 the winery employed the treated water chiefly for the washing processes of bottles tanks and pieces of equipment small amounts of water were also used for spirit production and for the cooling circuits that water required advanced treatments in order to achieve the quality necessary for the specific uses the scheme of the wtp is shown in fig 1 the groundwater conveyed by the two pipes is mixed at the inlet of the wtp and added with a 14 b w by weight solution of sodium hypochlorite naclo the naclo solution is supplied to provide a preliminary disinfection and to facilitate the oxidation of iron and manganese subsequently the water remains into a three compartment chamber with a total volume of 105 m3 located under the floor of the wtp s premise the first compartment has a volume of approx 20 m3 a total of 14 membrane air diffusers jager hd270 270 mm diameter are regularly distributed at 40 cm from the bottom of the tank the diffusers distribute air into the water at a volumetric flow rate of 100 m3 h through a 1 5 kw blower the air sparging should improve the oxidation of iron ii to iron iii oxide fe2o3 and allow the subsequent removal by settling the first compartment has a hydraulic retention time hrt of 50 min at a flow rate of 24 m3 h the two subsequent compartments have volumes of 14 m3 and 72 m3 respectively these two tanks are used as settling chambers to allow iron oxides be removed by settling the average hrt of the two compartments was of 35 min and 3 h respectively at a flow rate of 24 m3 h from the third compartment the water is pumped to a close pressurized dual media granular filter the filter has a volume of 4 m3 70 of which is filled with the granular media the two media are quartzite and pyrolusite quartzite granules are supplied in two different size ranges that is 3 5 mm and 0 8 1 2 mm pyrolusite a manganese oxide mno2 ρ 5 06 g cm3 is used to remove manganese through the combination of the processes of adsorption of mn2 on the pyrolusite surfaces and subsequent oxidation of the adsorbed species by chlorine 10 16 a granular activated carbon gac filter follows the dual media filter the gac filter is used to remove the residues of active chlorine in the form of hypochlorous acid hclo that results from the addition of the naclo solution and protect the final section of the wtp where a ro process is carried out the gac filter has a volume of 3 m3 and it is filled with 800 kg of 30 8 mesh vegetal gac the wtp managers did not consider the gac filter sufficient to guarantee a complete chlorine removal for the protection of the ro section consequently even chlorine suppressor agents such as sodium bisulfite nahso3 are currently used to remove residual amounts of active chlorine the two dual media and gac filters are regularly backwashed that is after the passing of 600 m3 of water i e 30 h the phases of the backwashing operation are detailed in table 3 a section of pre filtration precedes the final ro the pre filtration stage is composed of a first series of two 20 μm polypropylene cartridge filters and a subsequent 1 μm polypropylene cartridge filter the ro section is made of 5 fiberglass vessels each of them contains 3 thin film composite polyamide spiral wound membranes re8040 blr the ro section produces on average 14 m3 h of permeate and 6 m3 h of concentrate approximately 2 3 of the concentrate is stored in a 35 m3 reservoir and used for the dual media filter backwashing the remaining amount of concentrate 2 m3 h is recirculated back and mixed with the water that comes from the section of pre filtration a value of total dissolved solids tdss of 500 μs cm at the outlet of the ro section is guaranteed thanks to the blending of the permeate 14 m3 h with an amount of water 2 m3 h that comes from the outlet of the pre filtration section the recirculating amount of the concentrate is added of two antiscale compounds before being mixed with the water coming from the pre filtration section the two antiscale compounds are in the form of sodium polyphosphate 25 40 and a mixture of etidronic acid 5 and di hydrogen 1 hydroxy etilden di sodium phosphonate 10 the ro membrane regeneration process is carried out through periodic chemical cleanings with alkali sodium hydroxide plus surfactant and acidic c6h8o7 citric acid solutions a final chlorination with naclo guarantees the complete inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms the disinfected water is stored in a 124 m3 reservoir for end uses or subsequent enhanced treatments 2 3 water treatment plant survey wine production is a seasonal activity for that reason several survey campaigns were carried out on the wtp in different moments of the year surveys were aimed at collecting information concerning the quality of the water at the inlet and at the outlet of the wtp the characteristics of the pieces of the equipment of which the wtp is composed as described in section 2 2 their energy consumption and the type and amount of chemicals used for the water treatment processes the information acquired from the surveys was used i to identify the critical issues connected to the water treatment process ii to propose solutions for the optimization of the process and finally iii to quantify the economic impact of the introduction of the proposed solutions on the final unit cost of the treated water 2 4 tests for wtp optimization after having identified the main wtp s critical issues tests were executed to optimize the water treatment process one test was carried out with the aim of assessing the amount of oxidant 14 naclo solution necessary for iron and manganese oxidation the test was performed on a sample of real water collected at the inlet of the wtp a volume of 10 l of the mixture of the two ground waters coming from wells 1 3 and 2 was collected in a polypropylene tank the test was articulated in five steps 1 analysis of the main parameters orp fe mn free chlorine of the collected water sample 2 distribution of an air flow 50 l h into the water volume through porous stones for approx 50 min i e the air flow was consistent with the flow provided by the membrane air diffuser to the first compartment of the oxidation settling chamber and 50 min was the hrt of the compartment see fig 2 a 3 analysis of the parameters listed in step 1 in the water sample after the aeration treatment the residual concentrations of iron and manganese were determined after filtration on a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter sartorious ca syringe filters 25 mm ø in order to quantify only the concentration of the metals in the dissolved not oxidized form as prescribed by standard methods apha awwa wef 2017 17 4 mixing of the water volume after the aeration with three in sequence doses of naclo 4 mg l 10 mg l and 40 mg l the contact time between water and oxidant after the addition of each dose was of 30 min the oxidant was vigorously mixed with the water at the beginning and subsequently the water was left still 5 analysis of the parameters listed at step 1 in the water sample after each of the contact periods for the three above mentioned oxidant doses as in step 3 the residual concentrations of iron and manganese were determined after filtration on a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter the test was repeated three times concentrations of iron manganese and residual free chlorine were determined immediately at the end of each test step with rapid analytical kits reasol ipt see fig 2b 2 5 water treatment cost analysis the cost data used for the quantification of the unit cost of the treated water were obtained from the wtp survey campaigns mentioned in section 2 3 the cost analysis considered a period of ten months from june 2017 to march 2018 as in previous works 18 19 the overall unit cost for the treated water was calculated by including the cost items listed in the follow amortization installments for the replacement of pieces of equipment such as membranes for microfiltration and ro and purchase of raw materials for filter unit filling quartzite pyrolusite granular activated carbon amortization installments ai were calculated by multiplying the costs of the pieces of equipment and raw materials tc by the capital charge rate ccr as in eq 1 1 a i t c c c r t c i 1 1 i n the annual interest rate i and the operating life n were fixed to 5 and 3 years respectively operating costs for maintenance consulting energy raw materials and consumable specifically for the chemicals employed in the water treatment process 20 3 results and discussion 3 1 critical issues identification the first critical issue detected from the wtp s survey was an apparent excessive amount of naclo solution employed for the water treatment and specifically for iron and manganese oxidation in the wtp the naclo solution is added to the raw water immediately after the mixing of the two flows before the water enters into the three compartment chamber used for aeration and settling see section 2 2 the analysis of the cost data revealed that the amount of the 14 naclo solution purchased from june 2017 to march 2018 was of 15 000 kg in the same period the volume of the treated water was of 97 600 m3 consequently the dose of the pure oxidant distributed to the water was of 21 5 mg naclo l the theoretical amount of 14 naclo solution necessary for iron and manganese stoichiometric oxidation was calculated for comparison this calculation was carried out under the worst conditions that is the presence of peak concentration values of the two metals and complete inefficiency of the air sparging for iron oxidation the stoichiometric reactions for fe and mn oxidation through chlorine are shown in eqs 2 and 3 2 naclo 2 fe2 h 2 fe3 cl naoh 3 naclo mn2 h mn4 cl naoh consequently the stoichiometric chlorine doses for the oxidation of iron and manganese were of 0 67 mg naclo mg fe2 and 1 36 mg naclo mg mn2 respectively the maximum concentrations of iron and manganese found in the last five years in the groundwater collected from well n 2 the one with the lowest quality were of 4167 μg l for iron detected in april 2016 and 774 μg l for manganese detected in april 2017 as it can be seen from table 4 in the presence of peak concentrations a dose of 27 46 mg l of 14 naclo solution was necessary for the oxidation of the two metals consequently the theoretical amount of 14 naclo solution to be used for the oxidation of iron and manganese from june 2017 to march 2018 was calculated to be equal to 2680 kg the calculated amount even under the worst conditions was only approx 18 of the amount actually purchased and used in the wtp at a first glance it seemed that the oxidant was indeed overdosed with a consequent overexploit of the gac filter and a need of extra amounts of the chlorine suppressor agent an overdose of naclo could have several negative effects on the plant the oxidant that was not consumed for the oxidation of species in a reduced form has to be suppressed to avoid that it comes in contact with the membranes of microfiltration and ro in fact the final sections of the plant i e microfiltration and ro cannot tolerate concentrations of free chlorine of more than 0 1 mg l the gac column is used for this precise purpose but if the concentrations of residual free chlorine are too high due to an overdose of naclo solution the gac is not sufficient and the low concentrations required by the membranes can only be achieved by using chlorine suppressor substances thus determining additional costs for the plant the second critical issue concerned the process of backwashing of the dual media quartzite and pyrolusite filter at present the filter is subjected to a backwashing process made of three subsequent phases with air with the ro concentrate countercurrent and finally with the water from the third compartment co current of the aeration settling chamber all the exhaust water from both the second and the third phase of the backwashing is sent to the winery s wwtp after the identification of the above mentioned two critical issues some solutions were studied with the aim of improving the management of the wtp and reducing the operating costs of the water treatment process 3 2 solutions to optimize the water treatment process 3 2 1 naclo dosage for iron and manganese oxidation in section 3 1 it was observed that the amount of the 14 naclo solution actually purchased and used for the process of oxidation of fe and mn in the wtp was at least five times more than the amount calculated basing on stoichiometric considerations the oxidant dose found with the theoretical approach was subsequently verified with the aid of pilot tests carried out with real water samples collected at the inlet of the wtp the real need of naclo for iron oxidation had to be demonstrated because the air distributed in the first of the three compartment chamber was used exactly with the aim of facilitating the iron oxidation process the tests described in section 2 4 were used to quantify the right amount of naclo solution necessary to obtain the oxidation and consequent removal of iron and manganese the average values of the parameters orp fe mn free chlorine of the water samples subjected to the tests described in section 2 4 are listed in table 5 it can be seen that the initial concentrations of iron and manganese were in the order of 2 mg l and 0 2 mg l respectively the orp of the raw water was negative of 20 mv in line with the values normally found in a groundwater as expected no free chlorine was detected after the 50 minute aeration process the value of orp increased to 120 mv the aeration process determined an almost complete removal of iron in fact the residual concentration of dissolved iron decreased under the detection limit 0 05 mg l this result demonstrated that the process of air sparging was sufficient for the oxidation of iron and that the naclo was not necessary for that operation conversely the concentration of manganese was not altered by the aeration as described in section 2 4 after the step of aeration the water sample was mixed with a dose of 4 mg l 0 56 mg naclo l of the 14 naclo solution after a 30 min contact it was verified that the concentration of manganese was still unaltered only when the concentration of the 14 naclo solution was increased up to 40 mg l the concentration of soluble manganese was reduced to values under the detection limit 0 05 mg l the results found in the tests were coherent with observations from the literature in fact several lab pilot and field tests carried out since the 1960 s have demonstrated that the oxidation of iron with oxygen is relatively straightforward in low toc low mineral content groundwaters 21 22 conversely aeration has been found to be slow and ineffective even at high ph values for mn ii oxidation furthermore even the reaction between chlorine hocl the hydrolysis product of both gaseous cl2 and naclo and mn ii was too slow to be useful for water treatment unless the ph was raised to values above 9 the combination of the processes of adsorption and oxidation is necessary to achieve high efficiencies in mn ii removal when chlorinated water is passed through a filter containing a medium coated with mno2 the removal will occur by adsorption to the granular medium and the adsorbed mn ii will gradually be oxidized to mno2 on the filter medium surface 23 the results of the field tests demonstrated that the present amount of naclo used for water treatment was indeed overdosed the present concentration of pure oxidant 21 5 mg naclo l could be reduced by at least 75 that is lowered to 5 6 mg l or 40 mg l of 14 naclo solution without altering the capacity of the wtp of removing iron and manganese furthermore the field tests demonstrated that an efficient removal of iron could already be obtained with the sole aeration process for this reason in order to indeed save chlorine the introduction of the naclo solution into water had to be moved downstream the aeration chamber so as to achieve the oxidation of iron effectively by using air it has to be underlined that the naclo dose found in the test was in any case overestimated because it did not take into account of the combined effect of pyrolusite adsorption and chlorine oxidation in manganese removal the reduced utilization of the naclo would not have only a direct effect on the cost of the water treatment see section 3 3 but it also had indirect effects on a better utilization of the gac column and on the saving of chlorine suppressor substances 3 2 2 backwashing of the dual media filter the analysis of the backwashing phases sequence the quality of the waters used for the process and the availability of water flows of several natures in the wtp suggested that changes to improve the efficiency of the backwashing process were possible at present after an initial air washing the filter is backwashed firstly with the ro concentrate and subsequently with the water coming from the third compartment of the aeration settling chamber however according to the technical literature the conventional sequence of the phases in a backwashing process is a first water wash followed by an air wash and a final second water wash of the filter media 10 24 the first water wash aims to mainly dislodge the coarser solids accumulated in the filter media pores practical experience had demonstrated that backwashing of filter media grains smaller than 0 8 mm with water only is difficult 25 therefore a typical backwash cycle should include a combination sequence of air and water washing of the filtration media where the air wash is used to create greater turbulence and enhances particle scrubbing allowing to also dislodge the finer solids and some of the bacterial film accumulated on the grains of the filtration media finally the air wash is followed by another water wash which aims to remove the solids and air accumulated in the media and to prepare the filtration bed for another filtration cycle 25 in the context of the winery s wtp starting the backwashing sequence with a water washing was recommended because of the accumulation of fine particles of iron oxides into the porosity of the filter media however the utilization of the ro concentrate for the first water washing phase should be avoided in fact on the one hand the use of the ro concentrate instead of a filtered effluent for the backwashing of the filter has the positive effect of reducing the backwash volume and the energy needed to pump extra groundwater to the wtp on the other hand because of the corrosive nature of the ro concentrate due to the high concentrations of alkali earth metals and chlorides into the raw water backwashing with the ro concentrate is definitely not recommended 25 the combination of the backwashing phases and water flows shown in fig 3 allowed to increase the efficiency of the backwashing process as in fig 3 the water from the third compartment of the aeration settling chamber is used for the second co current water washing phase after being used for backwashing this water is stored in a tank and used for the first countercurrent backwashing operation only after that it is definitely sent to the wwtp this scheme allowed to avoid the use of the ro concentrate and to minimize the use of pre treated water after the preliminary aeration and settling treatment for the backwashing process 3 3 impact of the process improvements on the water treatment costs the volume of the raw water collected from the wells during the survey s period that is from june 2017 to march 2018 was of 89 260 m3 and the volume of finished water that is at the outlet of the wtp and ready for use was of approx 56 500 m3 the survey campaign on the wtp carried out as described in section 2 3 and the analysis of costs carried out as described in section 2 5 returned the costs for water treatment detailed in table 6 the overall cost for water treatment from june 2017 to march 2018 10 months was of approx 96 1 k of which 54 2 were for operating costs 24 3 were for chemicals and 21 4 for energy as detailed in fig 4 considering the same period the consequent unit cost for water treatment was of 1 70 m3 this cost was approx one half of the purchase cost of water for industrial purposes equal to 4 m3 that can be supplied by a local company for energy and water distribution 26 the solutions for a better management of the wtp presented in section 3 2 had inevitably positive impacts on the reduction of water treatment costs first of all as shown in fig 5 the reduced dose of oxidant had a direct impact on the saving of the naclo solution and the chlorine suppressor agent from the results of the field tests see section 3 1 2 it could be estimated that the chlorine consumption could be reduced by 75 without altering the efficiency in iron and manganese oxidation because of the lower employed dose of chlorine also the amount of chlorine suppressor could be reduced by at least 75 the reduced dose of oxidant had also a positive impact on the lifetime of the gac column and consequently on the aliquot of the amortization installment laid aside for the purchase of new gac that saving could be estimated in the order of 20 of the original amortization installment over long times the cautious use of reagents had a certain positive impact on the costs for maintenance and for the purchase of frequently used i e non amortizable consumables 27 28 this saving was estimated in a further 20 the overall cost for water treatment on a period of ten months would then reduce from 96 1 k to 79 0 k consequently the unit cost for water treatment would lower from 1 70 m3 to 1 40 m3 with a saving of approx 20 furthermore the reduced utilization of chemicals will make the wtp able to produce the same volumes of water with the same quality but with a higher environmental sustainability finally it had to be considered that the quality of the groundwater used to satisfy the winery requirements was not homogeneous water collected from wells n 1 and n 3 had a better quality than that collected from well n 2 field tests will have to be carried out to verify if the productivity of wells n 1 and n 3 could be increased without affecting the characteristics of the groundwater so as to definitely avoid the utilization of well n 2 that intervention would make possible to further reduce the use of chemicals for the groundwater treatment 4 conclusions the treatment processes performed in the wtp owned by the winery were deemed to be adequate to make the groundwater usable for cleaning operations however a survey carried out by the authors revealed the presence of two critical issues in the wtp s management concerning the fe ii and mn ii oxidation and removal and the backwashing of the dual media filter respectively for what concerns fe ii and mn ii oxidation and removal the results of pilot tests demonstrated that the sole process of air sparging was sufficient for the oxidation of iron and the injection of the 14 naclo solution was not necessary for that operation the amount of naclo returned by the survey and presently used for the water treatment was indeed overdosed the consequent concentration of pure oxidant 21 5 mg naclo l could be reduced by at least 75 that is lowered to 5 6 mg l or 40 mg l of 14 naclo solution without altering the capacity of the wtp of removing iron and manganese because an efficient removal of iron could be obtained already with the sole aeration process in order to indeed save chlorine the introduction of the naclo solution into water had to be moved downstream the aeration chamber so as to achieve the oxidation of iron effectively by using air with reference to the second critical issue a new combination of water fluxes could improve the efficiency of the dual media filter backwashing the new backwashing scheme should include a first countercurrent backwashing process with the water coming from the second backwashing step and a second co current washing phase with the water from the third compartment of the aeration settling chamber this new fluxes combination allowed to simultaneously avoid the use of the ro corrosive concentrate and to minimize the use of high quality water the introduction of these solutions into the wtp had an undeniable positive impact on the final unit cost of the treated water that decreased from 1 70 m3 to 1 40 m3 meanwhile the reduced utilization of chemicals will make the wtp able to produce water with the same quality but in a more environmentally friendly way credit authorship contribution statement alberto cerutti conceptualization formal analysis investigation writing review

13524,water is an essential ingredient in wine production the winery plant considered in this study located in the langhe area piedmont nw italy used approx 100 000 m3 per year of high quality water for cleaning and sanitation operations water was collected from the local shallow aquifer and contained high concentrations of dissolved iron fe ii 800 3500 μg l and manganese mn ii 300 700 μg l the water treatment plant wtp owned by the winery included a series of treatment processes air sparging and sodium hypochlorite injection settling filtration on a quartzite pyrolusite filter removal of excess chlorine with an activated carbon filter and finally microfiltration and reverse osmosis ro that were deemed to be adequate to make the groundwater compliant with potable uses however a survey carried out by the authors revealed the presence of two critical issues in the wtp s management concerning the fe ii and mn ii oxidation and removal and the backwashing of the dual media filter firstly the results of pilot tests demonstrated that the process of air sparging was sufficient for the oxidation of iron and that naclo was not necessary for that operation the present concentration of pure oxidant of 21 5 mg naclo l could be reduced by at least 75 without altering the capacity of the wtp in the removal of the two metals secondly a new combination of water fluxes could improve the efficiency of the dual media filter backwashing thus allowing to simultaneously avoid the use of the ro corrosive concentrate and to minimize the use of high quality water in the end a very basic cost model was used to compare the unit cost for water treatment in the current scenario and after the introduction of the two proposed solutions specifically that model considered three cost items operating costs that included four sub items mortgage maintenance consulting and cost for non amortizable raw materials and consumable the costs for the purchase of the chemicals necessary for the water treatment process and the energy costs the results coming from the application of the cost model demonstrated that the introduction of the proposed solutions into the wtp at no additional costs had an undeniable positive impact on the final unit cost of the treated water that was reduced by 20 keywords groundwater treatment iron manganese oxidation dual media filtration air sparging treatment cost energy consumption 1 introduction the langhe a hilly area located in the piedmont region nw italy is well known for the production of wines and sparkling wines appreciated all over the world that area was inscribed on the unesco s world heritage list in 2014 even because of the recognized value of such an area great efforts are necessary to enhance the environmental sustainability of the wines production processes water other than a precious natural resource for the survival and well being of humans and the ecosystem is an essential ingredient in wine production in fact it must support grape vine grown and fructification in the field and cleaning and sanitation processes of bottles and pieces of equipment in the winery recent studies have revealed that the water footprint of wine was in the order of 800 l of waters l of wine 1 that value came from both agricultural operations and winery processes for the latter ones it was reported that the production of 1 l of wine required 6 l of water with estimates that varied from as little as 2 l up to 20 l 2 3 consequently even in a winery an efficient and rationale usage of water is of primary concern to achieve a high degree of sustainability for wines production processes in most cases the water used for cleaning and sanitation processes in a winery comes from a dedicated water treatment plant wtp that collects raw water from the local deep or superficial water sources and makes it suitable for the winery operations in the case of the wine factory considered in this study the raw water came from a shallow aquifer and contained concentrations of dissolved iron fe ii and manganese mn ii such high as to make it unsuitable for cleaning and sanitation processes according to the italian regulation concerning the water intended for human consumption d lgs 31 01 in fact the concentration ranges of iron and manganese in the raw groundwater used by the winery were 800 3500 μg l and 300 700 μg l respectively with respect to the threshold values of 200 μg l for iron and 50 μg l for manganese fixed by d lgs 31 01 iron and manganese are quite widespread in most of the italian groundwaters 4 both in the langhe area and outside of the piedmont region 5 6 iron and manganese in waters have been recognized as the cause of aesthetic and operating issues such as discoloration of water staining of laundry and plumbing fixtures metallic taste and odor and scaling of pipes 7 furthermore recent studies reported that a manganese intake from water ingestion even at low levels may lead to intellectual impairment in children 8 as well as other neurological disorders 9 ferrous iron can be oxidized quickly by oxygen under controlled conditions particularly at alkaline ph only occasionally fe ii is complexed by natural organic matter nom to the degree that oxygen is unable to oxidize it in a reasonable time 10 after oxidation iron can be separated from water through settling or granular media filtration 11 conversely the conventional oxidation of mn ii through oxygen is very scarcely effective and the use of free chlorine or other stronger oxidants presents a series of drawbacks i free chlorine even at ph values of 8 0 or higher required several hours of contact and consequently large volume reactors to oxidize mn ii ii the oxidation efficiency of stronger oxidants such as ozone or potassium permanganate depends on a series of factors namely ph temperature initial dissolved manganese concentration contact time and presence of nom iii the presence of high concentrations of nom could cause pink water generation when potassium permanganate is used iv the oxidation of mn ii could form stabilized colloids with a high negative charge that are difficult to be separated by granular filtration but that could severely foul microfiltration or ultrafiltration membranes 12 for all the above listed reasons specific treatments are required for the removal of mn ii from groundwater it was recognized that the combined processes of adsorption and oxidation of mn ii onto manganese oxide mnox s coated media also known as natural greensand effect nge process was an effective and economic method for mn ii removal in the nge process mn ii is adsorbed onto the mnox s coating and then oxidized by chlorine at a neutral ph value thus creating additional mnox s 13 the use of pyrolusite as an adsorbing medium has shown a number of benefits in comparison with contactors containing mnox s coated sand in fact pyrolusite is a natural manganese ore consisting of more than 80 mno2 it has high density of adsorption sites and finally because of its specific gravity in the order of 5 it guarantees reduced particle entrainment and adequate media separation when a dual media granular filter e g quartzite pyrolusite is used 14 15 the wtp belonging to the winery considered in this study was originally designed and built with the aim of removing iron manganese and total hardness due to the presence of high amounts of calcium and magnesium into the groundwater that made the collected groundwater not suitable for cleaning processes of bottles tanks and pieces of equipment the wtp includes the processes of oxidation with air and chlorine settling filtration on a granular dual media quartzite pyrolusite filter removal of excess chlorine through adsorption on an activated carbon filter and finally microfiltration and reverse osmosis ro even in the light of the considerations reported above concerning the best techniques for iron and manganese removal the combination of the operations performed in the wtp was deemed to be adequate for iron manganese and total hardness removal however a survey carried out by the authors on the wtp revealed the presence of some critical issues those issues seemed to be mainly related to an apparent excessive amount of chemicals used for the treatment operations and to the maintenance of the main pieces of equipment of the wtp consequently several survey campaigns were carried out to collect information concerning the quality of the water at the inlet and at the outlet of the wtp the characteristics of the pieces of equipment used in the wtp their energy consumption and the type and amount of chemicals used for the water treatment processes the gathered information was used i to identify the critical issues connected to the water treatment process ii to propose solutions for the optimization of the process and finally iii to quantify the economic impact coming from the introduction of the proposed solutions on the final unit cost of the treated water 2 materials and methods 2 1 groundwater quality the winery used approx 100 000 m3 of water per year for operations of cleaning and sanitation of bottles tanks and pieces of equipment the water demand of the winery was satisfied with the groundwater collected from the local shallow aquifer through three wells namely well n 1 n 2 and n 3 well n 1 and well n 3 were very close the one to the other conversely well n 2 was 50 m distant from wells n 1 and n 3 the characteristics of the three wells are shown in table 1 two pipes carried the groundwater from the wells to the inlet of the wtp one pipe conveyed the mixture of the groundwater collected from wells n 1 and n 3 the other pipe conveyed the groundwater collected from well n 2 the winery carried out periodic sampling campaigns at the outlet of each of the two pipes to monitor the quality of the water conveyed by the two pipes separately an external certified laboratory has assessed the quality of the groundwater through the analysis of the following parameters ph electrical conductivity ec chloride sulfate nitrogen compounds ammonium nitrite nitrate earth alkali metals calcium magnesium and total hardness metals and heavy metals fe mn as cd cr hg ni pb cu se and biological parameters total coliforms escherichia coli enterococci the results of the analyses carried out on the groundwater collected from wells n 1 and n 3 and from well n 2 in the period 2015 2017 are detailed in table 2 from the values of table 2 it can be seen that iron and manganese were the most critical compounds because their concentrations exceeded the threshold values fixed by italian d lgs 31 01 in almost all of the sampling dates in fact the concentrations of iron and manganese in the groundwater from wells n 1 and n 3 were 3 4 times higher than the threshold values of 200 and 50 μg l respectively and those in the groundwater from well n 2 were even 15 20 times higher furthermore the quality of the groundwater collected from wells n 1 and n 3 was on average superior to that collected from well n 2 specifically the average 2015 2017 concentration of iron in well n 2 was five times higher than that found in wells n 1 and n 3 3306 μg l vs 634 μg l and the concentration of manganese was two times higher 611 μg l vs 322 μg l finally the concentrations of iron and manganese in the two wells in the last two years 2016 2017 were at almost constant values other than iron and manganese also chloride and total hardness deserved special attention in fact the average concentration of chloride was 193 mg l in wells n 1 and n 3 and 207 mg l in well n 2 respectively while the threshold value was at 250 mg l the average total hardness was approx 51 f in wells n 1 and n 3 and of more than 60 f in the waters of well n 2 there are no threshold values for total hardness fixed by the italian law that regulates drinking water but the groundwater of that site was found to be very hard thus exceeding the upper limit of the range 15 50 f recommended for household or industrial uses 2 2 water treatment plant description the wtp owned by the winery was originally designed with the aim of removing those compounds namely iron manganese and earth alkali metals calcium magnesium that made the collected groundwater not suitable for household or industrial uses the yearly average volume of the water treated in the wtp was in the order of 130 000 m3 the winery employed the treated water chiefly for the washing processes of bottles tanks and pieces of equipment small amounts of water were also used for spirit production and for the cooling circuits that water required advanced treatments in order to achieve the quality necessary for the specific uses the scheme of the wtp is shown in fig 1 the groundwater conveyed by the two pipes is mixed at the inlet of the wtp and added with a 14 b w by weight solution of sodium hypochlorite naclo the naclo solution is supplied to provide a preliminary disinfection and to facilitate the oxidation of iron and manganese subsequently the water remains into a three compartment chamber with a total volume of 105 m3 located under the floor of the wtp s premise the first compartment has a volume of approx 20 m3 a total of 14 membrane air diffusers jager hd270 270 mm diameter are regularly distributed at 40 cm from the bottom of the tank the diffusers distribute air into the water at a volumetric flow rate of 100 m3 h through a 1 5 kw blower the air sparging should improve the oxidation of iron ii to iron iii oxide fe2o3 and allow the subsequent removal by settling the first compartment has a hydraulic retention time hrt of 50 min at a flow rate of 24 m3 h the two subsequent compartments have volumes of 14 m3 and 72 m3 respectively these two tanks are used as settling chambers to allow iron oxides be removed by settling the average hrt of the two compartments was of 35 min and 3 h respectively at a flow rate of 24 m3 h from the third compartment the water is pumped to a close pressurized dual media granular filter the filter has a volume of 4 m3 70 of which is filled with the granular media the two media are quartzite and pyrolusite quartzite granules are supplied in two different size ranges that is 3 5 mm and 0 8 1 2 mm pyrolusite a manganese oxide mno2 ρ 5 06 g cm3 is used to remove manganese through the combination of the processes of adsorption of mn2 on the pyrolusite surfaces and subsequent oxidation of the adsorbed species by chlorine 10 16 a granular activated carbon gac filter follows the dual media filter the gac filter is used to remove the residues of active chlorine in the form of hypochlorous acid hclo that results from the addition of the naclo solution and protect the final section of the wtp where a ro process is carried out the gac filter has a volume of 3 m3 and it is filled with 800 kg of 30 8 mesh vegetal gac the wtp managers did not consider the gac filter sufficient to guarantee a complete chlorine removal for the protection of the ro section consequently even chlorine suppressor agents such as sodium bisulfite nahso3 are currently used to remove residual amounts of active chlorine the two dual media and gac filters are regularly backwashed that is after the passing of 600 m3 of water i e 30 h the phases of the backwashing operation are detailed in table 3 a section of pre filtration precedes the final ro the pre filtration stage is composed of a first series of two 20 μm polypropylene cartridge filters and a subsequent 1 μm polypropylene cartridge filter the ro section is made of 5 fiberglass vessels each of them contains 3 thin film composite polyamide spiral wound membranes re8040 blr the ro section produces on average 14 m3 h of permeate and 6 m3 h of concentrate approximately 2 3 of the concentrate is stored in a 35 m3 reservoir and used for the dual media filter backwashing the remaining amount of concentrate 2 m3 h is recirculated back and mixed with the water that comes from the section of pre filtration a value of total dissolved solids tdss of 500 μs cm at the outlet of the ro section is guaranteed thanks to the blending of the permeate 14 m3 h with an amount of water 2 m3 h that comes from the outlet of the pre filtration section the recirculating amount of the concentrate is added of two antiscale compounds before being mixed with the water coming from the pre filtration section the two antiscale compounds are in the form of sodium polyphosphate 25 40 and a mixture of etidronic acid 5 and di hydrogen 1 hydroxy etilden di sodium phosphonate 10 the ro membrane regeneration process is carried out through periodic chemical cleanings with alkali sodium hydroxide plus surfactant and acidic c6h8o7 citric acid solutions a final chlorination with naclo guarantees the complete inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms the disinfected water is stored in a 124 m3 reservoir for end uses or subsequent enhanced treatments 2 3 water treatment plant survey wine production is a seasonal activity for that reason several survey campaigns were carried out on the wtp in different moments of the year surveys were aimed at collecting information concerning the quality of the water at the inlet and at the outlet of the wtp the characteristics of the pieces of the equipment of which the wtp is composed as described in section 2 2 their energy consumption and the type and amount of chemicals used for the water treatment processes the information acquired from the surveys was used i to identify the critical issues connected to the water treatment process ii to propose solutions for the optimization of the process and finally iii to quantify the economic impact of the introduction of the proposed solutions on the final unit cost of the treated water 2 4 tests for wtp optimization after having identified the main wtp s critical issues tests were executed to optimize the water treatment process one test was carried out with the aim of assessing the amount of oxidant 14 naclo solution necessary for iron and manganese oxidation the test was performed on a sample of real water collected at the inlet of the wtp a volume of 10 l of the mixture of the two ground waters coming from wells 1 3 and 2 was collected in a polypropylene tank the test was articulated in five steps 1 analysis of the main parameters orp fe mn free chlorine of the collected water sample 2 distribution of an air flow 50 l h into the water volume through porous stones for approx 50 min i e the air flow was consistent with the flow provided by the membrane air diffuser to the first compartment of the oxidation settling chamber and 50 min was the hrt of the compartment see fig 2 a 3 analysis of the parameters listed in step 1 in the water sample after the aeration treatment the residual concentrations of iron and manganese were determined after filtration on a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter sartorious ca syringe filters 25 mm ø in order to quantify only the concentration of the metals in the dissolved not oxidized form as prescribed by standard methods apha awwa wef 2017 17 4 mixing of the water volume after the aeration with three in sequence doses of naclo 4 mg l 10 mg l and 40 mg l the contact time between water and oxidant after the addition of each dose was of 30 min the oxidant was vigorously mixed with the water at the beginning and subsequently the water was left still 5 analysis of the parameters listed at step 1 in the water sample after each of the contact periods for the three above mentioned oxidant doses as in step 3 the residual concentrations of iron and manganese were determined after filtration on a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter the test was repeated three times concentrations of iron manganese and residual free chlorine were determined immediately at the end of each test step with rapid analytical kits reasol ipt see fig 2b 2 5 water treatment cost analysis the cost data used for the quantification of the unit cost of the treated water were obtained from the wtp survey campaigns mentioned in section 2 3 the cost analysis considered a period of ten months from june 2017 to march 2018 as in previous works 18 19 the overall unit cost for the treated water was calculated by including the cost items listed in the follow amortization installments for the replacement of pieces of equipment such as membranes for microfiltration and ro and purchase of raw materials for filter unit filling quartzite pyrolusite granular activated carbon amortization installments ai were calculated by multiplying the costs of the pieces of equipment and raw materials tc by the capital charge rate ccr as in eq 1 1 a i t c c c r t c i 1 1 i n the annual interest rate i and the operating life n were fixed to 5 and 3 years respectively operating costs for maintenance consulting energy raw materials and consumable specifically for the chemicals employed in the water treatment process 20 3 results and discussion 3 1 critical issues identification the first critical issue detected from the wtp s survey was an apparent excessive amount of naclo solution employed for the water treatment and specifically for iron and manganese oxidation in the wtp the naclo solution is added to the raw water immediately after the mixing of the two flows before the water enters into the three compartment chamber used for aeration and settling see section 2 2 the analysis of the cost data revealed that the amount of the 14 naclo solution purchased from june 2017 to march 2018 was of 15 000 kg in the same period the volume of the treated water was of 97 600 m3 consequently the dose of the pure oxidant distributed to the water was of 21 5 mg naclo l the theoretical amount of 14 naclo solution necessary for iron and manganese stoichiometric oxidation was calculated for comparison this calculation was carried out under the worst conditions that is the presence of peak concentration values of the two metals and complete inefficiency of the air sparging for iron oxidation the stoichiometric reactions for fe and mn oxidation through chlorine are shown in eqs 2 and 3 2 naclo 2 fe2 h 2 fe3 cl naoh 3 naclo mn2 h mn4 cl naoh consequently the stoichiometric chlorine doses for the oxidation of iron and manganese were of 0 67 mg naclo mg fe2 and 1 36 mg naclo mg mn2 respectively the maximum concentrations of iron and manganese found in the last five years in the groundwater collected from well n 2 the one with the lowest quality were of 4167 μg l for iron detected in april 2016 and 774 μg l for manganese detected in april 2017 as it can be seen from table 4 in the presence of peak concentrations a dose of 27 46 mg l of 14 naclo solution was necessary for the oxidation of the two metals consequently the theoretical amount of 14 naclo solution to be used for the oxidation of iron and manganese from june 2017 to march 2018 was calculated to be equal to 2680 kg the calculated amount even under the worst conditions was only approx 18 of the amount actually purchased and used in the wtp at a first glance it seemed that the oxidant was indeed overdosed with a consequent overexploit of the gac filter and a need of extra amounts of the chlorine suppressor agent an overdose of naclo could have several negative effects on the plant the oxidant that was not consumed for the oxidation of species in a reduced form has to be suppressed to avoid that it comes in contact with the membranes of microfiltration and ro in fact the final sections of the plant i e microfiltration and ro cannot tolerate concentrations of free chlorine of more than 0 1 mg l the gac column is used for this precise purpose but if the concentrations of residual free chlorine are too high due to an overdose of naclo solution the gac is not sufficient and the low concentrations required by the membranes can only be achieved by using chlorine suppressor substances thus determining additional costs for the plant the second critical issue concerned the process of backwashing of the dual media quartzite and pyrolusite filter at present the filter is subjected to a backwashing process made of three subsequent phases with air with the ro concentrate countercurrent and finally with the water from the third compartment co current of the aeration settling chamber all the exhaust water from both the second and the third phase of the backwashing is sent to the winery s wwtp after the identification of the above mentioned two critical issues some solutions were studied with the aim of improving the management of the wtp and reducing the operating costs of the water treatment process 3 2 solutions to optimize the water treatment process 3 2 1 naclo dosage for iron and manganese oxidation in section 3 1 it was observed that the amount of the 14 naclo solution actually purchased and used for the process of oxidation of fe and mn in the wtp was at least five times more than the amount calculated basing on stoichiometric considerations the oxidant dose found with the theoretical approach was subsequently verified with the aid of pilot tests carried out with real water samples collected at the inlet of the wtp the real need of naclo for iron oxidation had to be demonstrated because the air distributed in the first of the three compartment chamber was used exactly with the aim of facilitating the iron oxidation process the tests described in section 2 4 were used to quantify the right amount of naclo solution necessary to obtain the oxidation and consequent removal of iron and manganese the average values of the parameters orp fe mn free chlorine of the water samples subjected to the tests described in section 2 4 are listed in table 5 it can be seen that the initial concentrations of iron and manganese were in the order of 2 mg l and 0 2 mg l respectively the orp of the raw water was negative of 20 mv in line with the values normally found in a groundwater as expected no free chlorine was detected after the 50 minute aeration process the value of orp increased to 120 mv the aeration process determined an almost complete removal of iron in fact the residual concentration of dissolved iron decreased under the detection limit 0 05 mg l this result demonstrated that the process of air sparging was sufficient for the oxidation of iron and that the naclo was not necessary for that operation conversely the concentration of manganese was not altered by the aeration as described in section 2 4 after the step of aeration the water sample was mixed with a dose of 4 mg l 0 56 mg naclo l of the 14 naclo solution after a 30 min contact it was verified that the concentration of manganese was still unaltered only when the concentration of the 14 naclo solution was increased up to 40 mg l the concentration of soluble manganese was reduced to values under the detection limit 0 05 mg l the results found in the tests were coherent with observations from the literature in fact several lab pilot and field tests carried out since the 1960 s have demonstrated that the oxidation of iron with oxygen is relatively straightforward in low toc low mineral content groundwaters 21 22 conversely aeration has been found to be slow and ineffective even at high ph values for mn ii oxidation furthermore even the reaction between chlorine hocl the hydrolysis product of both gaseous cl2 and naclo and mn ii was too slow to be useful for water treatment unless the ph was raised to values above 9 the combination of the processes of adsorption and oxidation is necessary to achieve high efficiencies in mn ii removal when chlorinated water is passed through a filter containing a medium coated with mno2 the removal will occur by adsorption to the granular medium and the adsorbed mn ii will gradually be oxidized to mno2 on the filter medium surface 23 the results of the field tests demonstrated that the present amount of naclo used for water treatment was indeed overdosed the present concentration of pure oxidant 21 5 mg naclo l could be reduced by at least 75 that is lowered to 5 6 mg l or 40 mg l of 14 naclo solution without altering the capacity of the wtp of removing iron and manganese furthermore the field tests demonstrated that an efficient removal of iron could already be obtained with the sole aeration process for this reason in order to indeed save chlorine the introduction of the naclo solution into water had to be moved downstream the aeration chamber so as to achieve the oxidation of iron effectively by using air it has to be underlined that the naclo dose found in the test was in any case overestimated because it did not take into account of the combined effect of pyrolusite adsorption and chlorine oxidation in manganese removal the reduced utilization of the naclo would not have only a direct effect on the cost of the water treatment see section 3 3 but it also had indirect effects on a better utilization of the gac column and on the saving of chlorine suppressor substances 3 2 2 backwashing of the dual media filter the analysis of the backwashing phases sequence the quality of the waters used for the process and the availability of water flows of several natures in the wtp suggested that changes to improve the efficiency of the backwashing process were possible at present after an initial air washing the filter is backwashed firstly with the ro concentrate and subsequently with the water coming from the third compartment of the aeration settling chamber however according to the technical literature the conventional sequence of the phases in a backwashing process is a first water wash followed by an air wash and a final second water wash of the filter media 10 24 the first water wash aims to mainly dislodge the coarser solids accumulated in the filter media pores practical experience had demonstrated that backwashing of filter media grains smaller than 0 8 mm with water only is difficult 25 therefore a typical backwash cycle should include a combination sequence of air and water washing of the filtration media where the air wash is used to create greater turbulence and enhances particle scrubbing allowing to also dislodge the finer solids and some of the bacterial film accumulated on the grains of the filtration media finally the air wash is followed by another water wash which aims to remove the solids and air accumulated in the media and to prepare the filtration bed for another filtration cycle 25 in the context of the winery s wtp starting the backwashing sequence with a water washing was recommended because of the accumulation of fine particles of iron oxides into the porosity of the filter media however the utilization of the ro concentrate for the first water washing phase should be avoided in fact on the one hand the use of the ro concentrate instead of a filtered effluent for the backwashing of the filter has the positive effect of reducing the backwash volume and the energy needed to pump extra groundwater to the wtp on the other hand because of the corrosive nature of the ro concentrate due to the high concentrations of alkali earth metals and chlorides into the raw water backwashing with the ro concentrate is definitely not recommended 25 the combination of the backwashing phases and water flows shown in fig 3 allowed to increase the efficiency of the backwashing process as in fig 3 the water from the third compartment of the aeration settling chamber is used for the second co current water washing phase after being used for backwashing this water is stored in a tank and used for the first countercurrent backwashing operation only after that it is definitely sent to the wwtp this scheme allowed to avoid the use of the ro concentrate and to minimize the use of pre treated water after the preliminary aeration and settling treatment for the backwashing process 3 3 impact of the process improvements on the water treatment costs the volume of the raw water collected from the wells during the survey s period that is from june 2017 to march 2018 was of 89 260 m3 and the volume of finished water that is at the outlet of the wtp and ready for use was of approx 56 500 m3 the survey campaign on the wtp carried out as described in section 2 3 and the analysis of costs carried out as described in section 2 5 returned the costs for water treatment detailed in table 6 the overall cost for water treatment from june 2017 to march 2018 10 months was of approx 96 1 k of which 54 2 were for operating costs 24 3 were for chemicals and 21 4 for energy as detailed in fig 4 considering the same period the consequent unit cost for water treatment was of 1 70 m3 this cost was approx one half of the purchase cost of water for industrial purposes equal to 4 m3 that can be supplied by a local company for energy and water distribution 26 the solutions for a better management of the wtp presented in section 3 2 had inevitably positive impacts on the reduction of water treatment costs first of all as shown in fig 5 the reduced dose of oxidant had a direct impact on the saving of the naclo solution and the chlorine suppressor agent from the results of the field tests see section 3 1 2 it could be estimated that the chlorine consumption could be reduced by 75 without altering the efficiency in iron and manganese oxidation because of the lower employed dose of chlorine also the amount of chlorine suppressor could be reduced by at least 75 the reduced dose of oxidant had also a positive impact on the lifetime of the gac column and consequently on the aliquot of the amortization installment laid aside for the purchase of new gac that saving could be estimated in the order of 20 of the original amortization installment over long times the cautious use of reagents had a certain positive impact on the costs for maintenance and for the purchase of frequently used i e non amortizable consumables 27 28 this saving was estimated in a further 20 the overall cost for water treatment on a period of ten months would then reduce from 96 1 k to 79 0 k consequently the unit cost for water treatment would lower from 1 70 m3 to 1 40 m3 with a saving of approx 20 furthermore the reduced utilization of chemicals will make the wtp able to produce the same volumes of water with the same quality but with a higher environmental sustainability finally it had to be considered that the quality of the groundwater used to satisfy the winery requirements was not homogeneous water collected from wells n 1 and n 3 had a better quality than that collected from well n 2 field tests will have to be carried out to verify if the productivity of wells n 1 and n 3 could be increased without affecting the characteristics of the groundwater so as to definitely avoid the utilization of well n 2 that intervention would make possible to further reduce the use of chemicals for the groundwater treatment 4 conclusions the treatment processes performed in the wtp owned by the winery were deemed to be adequate to make the groundwater usable for cleaning operations however a survey carried out by the authors revealed the presence of two critical issues in the wtp s management concerning the fe ii and mn ii oxidation and removal and the backwashing of the dual media filter respectively for what concerns fe ii and mn ii oxidation and removal the results of pilot tests demonstrated that the sole process of air sparging was sufficient for the oxidation of iron and the injection of the 14 naclo solution was not necessary for that operation the amount of naclo returned by the survey and presently used for the water treatment was indeed overdosed the consequent concentration of pure oxidant 21 5 mg naclo l could be reduced by at least 75 that is lowered to 5 6 mg l or 40 mg l of 14 naclo solution without altering the capacity of the wtp of removing iron and manganese because an efficient removal of iron could be obtained already with the sole aeration process in order to indeed save chlorine the introduction of the naclo solution into water had to be moved downstream the aeration chamber so as to achieve the oxidation of iron effectively by using air with reference to the second critical issue a new combination of water fluxes could improve the efficiency of the dual media filter backwashing the new backwashing scheme should include a first countercurrent backwashing process with the water coming from the second backwashing step and a second co current washing phase with the water from the third compartment of the aeration settling chamber this new fluxes combination allowed to simultaneously avoid the use of the ro corrosive concentrate and to minimize the use of high quality water the introduction of these solutions into the wtp had an undeniable positive impact on the final unit cost of the treated water that decreased from 1 70 m3 to 1 40 m3 meanwhile the reduced utilization of chemicals will make the wtp able to produce water with the same quality but in a more environmentally friendly way credit authorship contribution statement alberto cerutti conceptualization formal analysis investigation writing review
