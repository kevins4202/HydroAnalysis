15210,the basic premise of anammox technical application reliability in municipal wastewater treatment is substantially enriched anammox bacteria to enrich the anammox the special interaction mechanism between the suspended sludge ss and anoxic biofilm was investigated over three months in a partial denitrification anammox biosystem subjected to dynamic changes in ss absence presence absence results show that the introduction of ss significantly decreased the anammox nitrogen removal efficiency 83 8 6 5 48 7 17 0 with the presence or absence of ss the spatial distribution of anammox bacteria within the anoxic biofilm gradually changed between the inner and outer layers as detected by clsm fish qpcr and metagenomic sequencing show that changes in the presence and absence status of ss significantly reduced the abundance of the no reducing functional gene while the no supply capacity no3 no was improved further favoring the anammox process batch tests and typical cycles further demonstrated that the anammox bacteria can stably acquire no2 and anammox bacteria in the anoxic biofilm competed far more no2 than denitrifying bacteria according to the typical ph curve accordingly the abundance of candidatus brocadia as detected by high throughput sequencing decreased in the anoxic biofilms with the introduction of ss but greatly increased 0 82 2 22 after ss

anammox anoxic biofilm suspended sludge spatial distribution metagenomic sequencing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the requirements for saving energy and reducing operating costs have accelerated the rapid transformation of traditional municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps without the need for aeration or organic carbon source anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox uses ammonium nh4 and nitrite no2 to produce n2 and is considered as a revolutionary technology in the future lin and wang 2017 ma et al 2016 yang et al 2021 ammonia is generally rich in municipal wastewater while no2 as the anammox substrate is objectively lacking and not easy to stably obtain in order to overcome this bottleneck various researchers have explored ways to acquire no2 according to the different ways of obtaining no2 anammox is mainly employed through two processes partial nitrification anammox pn a and partial denitrification anammox pd a pn a is a completely autotrophic nitrogen removal process that has the advantages of maximum energy saving and a theoretical reduction of carbon source consumption dong and sun 2007 miao et al 2018 wang et al 2010 the key to achieving partial nitrification is the effective suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nevertheless full inhibition of nob activity is still difficult wett et al 2013 and 11 of nitrate is produced by anammox li et al 2018 which will block the effluent nitrate from reaching the standard stably although the research on pn a continues to deepen pd a has recently been receiving increasing attention cao et al 2019 gao et al 2021 the pd a process combines heterotrophic autotrophic metabolism with nitrogen removal anammox driven by partial denitrification can improve the nitrogen removal efficiency by consuming residual nitrate and the subsequent no2 reduction process avoids toxicity to anammox bacteria caused by excessive no2 especially under continuous flow the use of pd a technologies in biofilm based systems has presented more powerful nitrogen removal advantages and application potential in recent years specifically activated sludge processes are often used in traditional wwtps however anammox bacteria are not easily retained or enriched in suspended sludge ss under the same sludge retention time due to their long doubling time lotti et al 2014 van der star et al 2007 biofilm based processes are considered to be effective for enriching slow growing microorganisms kosgey et al 2021 torresi et al 2016 thereby allowing for different sludge retention times considering the necessity of ss in traditional wwtps zhang et al 2021 2016 the ss biofilm mixing mode of a continuous flow system guarantees the retention of anammox bacteria in lab scale pilot scale and full scale studies partial denitrification coupled with anammox has been achieved by adding anoxic biofilm carriers in the anoxic zone of the a2o process li et al 2020 2019 zhao et al 2022 anoxic environment low dissolved oxygen do low organic carbon concentration provides extremely favorable conditions for anammox and is considered to provide the optimal theoretical conditions for anammox to occur mulder et al 1995 these studies showed that anammox bacteria could be successfully enriched in the mixed ss biofilm system and that the nitrogen removal efficiency is significantly improved even when the proportion of anammox bacteria is low thus it can be inferred that the introduction of anammox bacteria in the form of biofilms in the anoxic environment deserves special attention and research a low abundance of anammox bacteria has been observed in conventional wwtps units van der star et al 2007 wang et al 2015 and the anammox nitrogen removal contribution is expected to be further strengthened when focusing on improving the anammox contribution to nitrogen removal the key premise is the in situ enrichment of anammox bacteria an interesting study found that anammox bacteria were highly enriched in situ in anoxic carrier biofilm when the ss in a pd a driven a2 o system was accidentally lost li et al 2021 moreover many studies have shown that anammox bacteria have a significant niche preference for anoxic biofilm rather than ss causing ss and biofilm to have different aggregation effects on microorganisms kosgey et al 2021 li et al 2020 zheng et al 2016 therefore balancing the specific interaction relationship between biofilm and ss may provide new ideas for in situ enrichment of anammox bacteria which has never been further explored according to previous studies anammox bacteria tend to be enriched on the carriers and the loss of ss can even accelerate the in situ enrichment of anammox bacteria in the anoxic biofilm of pd a systems thus the objectives of the present study were to investigate i the contribution of autotrophic heterotrophic nitrogen removal can be optimized by adjusting the ratio of biofilm to ss in the anoxic zone and ii the in situ enrichment of anammox bacteria can be accelerated by reducing ss in order to explore the in situ enrichment mechanism of anammox bacteria by reducing ss in the anoxic zone of a pd a system a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr was successfully constructed and continuously operated over three months the microbial community structure and niche changes were analyzed in depth through 16s rrna gene sequencing metagenomic sequencing qpcr and confocal laser scanning microscopy fluorescence in situ hybridization clsm fish the results of this study are expected to provide technical and scientific support for the application of anammox in mainstream wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation this study was conducted using a mbbr made of cylindrical plexiglass with a working volume of 3 0 l fig s1 the inoculated biofilm was taken from the anoxic zone of a municipal wwtp li et al 2019 and filled into the system at a filling ratio of 40 the mbbr

system was synthetic wastewater the influent nh4 n and no3 n concentrations of the system were determined as 20 mg n l and 32 mg n l respectively by measuring the anoxic biofilm activity before inoculation the designed cod no3 ratio of the system was 1 5 and 48 mg l sodium acetate ch3coona was added in order to ensure the system environment was strictly anoxic the do concentrations were reduced to below 0 05 mg l using high purity n2 before each operation the reaction temperature of the entire system was 25 6 1 0 c the temperature in the reactor was strictly controlled with a temperature feedback system the whole long term operation was divided into three phases phase i 1 28 days was operated in pure anoxic biofilm mode in phase ii 29 57 days the ss was introduced which represented the coexisting anoxic biofilm and ss mode in phase iii 58 110 days ss was completely discharged thus according to the ss status the reactors operated in the absence phase i then presence phase ii and finally absence phase iii of ss in the second phase the ss was inoculated from the sedimentation tank of the gaobeidian municipal wwtp beijing china the system was designed to replace the ss every 7 8 days in order to simulate the anoxic environment of the actual wwtp as well as to more strictly ensure that the ss was not domesticated and that the mixed liquid volatile suspended solids

moisture ash analyzer prepash 212 switzerland do ph and temperature were monitored in real time using a multichannel sensor multi 3620 wtw company germany 2 3 ex situ batch tests batch tests were used to detect the anammox and denitrification activity of the biofilm and ss of each phase before the batch tests the biofilm and ss in the main test device were washed with washing media van loosdrecht et al 2016 and then placed in a 0 5 l brown bottle as with the long term test the filling ratio of the biofilm was 40 trace elements and mineral elements table s1 were added and milli q water was used to quantify to 0 5 l prior to the anoxic batch tests n2 was pumped into the device to remove oxygen so as to avoid as much interference of oxygen on microbial activity as possible after the above pretreatment test devices were placed in a water bath shaker gfl1092 germany at a speed of 140 rpm and temperature of 30 0 0 1 c 2 4 clsm fish to explore the influence of ss on the spatial distribution of anammox bacteria in biofilms clsm fish technology was used to analyze the collected biofilm samples at the end of each phase first the biofilm carriers were washed by pbs phosphate buffered saline 130 mm sodium chloride 10 mm phosphate buffer and fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde pfa then the fixed biofilms were embedded with o c t compound sakura tissue tek a medium for frozen tissue specimens to ensure optimal cutting temperature o c t the processed biofilm carriers were placed at 80 c for 24 h after freezing the biofilm carrier the biofilm was completely separated from the carrier to obtain a complete biofilm from a single pore and the embedding agent was used again for embedding a microtome leicacm1900 cryostat was used to slice the above mentioned embedded body the slices were successively immersed in 50 80 and 96 ethanol for dehydration persson et al 2014 after completion of the above pretreatment process a hybridization buffer and probe mixture table s2 was smeared on the sample glass slide and then the samples were placed in a hybridization sampling box at 46 c for 2 h after removing the slides washing buffer with different formamide concentrations was used to wash the probe for 15 min and then 2 μl of anti fluorescence attenuator was added finally the biofilms were observed by clsm olympus fv1200 tokyo japan 2 5 dna extraction and qpcr analysis 2 5 1 dna extraction to analyze the dynamic response of microbial functional genes during each phase samples were collected of the initial biofilm inoculum and the biofilm at the end of phases i ii and iii the ss from the beginning and end of the phase ii and the initial ss from the last sludge change were also collected a freeze dryer labconco freezone plus 2 5 l usa was used to freeze dry the sludge sample after homogenization dna was extracted from 0 05 to 0 10 g of dry sludge using the fast dna spin kit for soil kit bio 101 vista ca usa following the manufacturer s instructions finally the nanodrop nd 1000 nanodrop technologies wilmington was used to quantify the dna 2 5 2 qpcr the abundance of anammox 16s rrna hzsb narg napa nirs nirk and nosz functional genes were determined by qpcr the total reaction volume was 20 μl and contained 10 μl of tb green takara dalian china 2 μl of dna forward primer reverse primer and double distilled water the reaction conditions and forward and reverse primers table s3 were based on the different target genes the qpcrs were carried out using the mx3000p real time pcr system stratagene la jolla ca usa and three biological replicates were performed for each sample in this reaction system 2 μl of dna sample was diluted to control the concentration below 100 ng and the concentration of the standard plasmid was serially diluted 10 fold to obtain a standard curve representing a 102 108 linear gradient of the gene copy number 2 6 microbiological analysis methods 2 6 1 high throughput sequencing the purpose of the high throughput analysis was to in depth analyze the dynamic response of the microbial communities from the anoxic biofilm and ss during different phases the v3 v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using the primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 amplicon sequencing was then performed using the illumina miseq pe300 platform and three biological replicates were performed

redundant gene set with the kegg gene database genes and kobas 2 0 kegg orthology based annotation system was used for functional annotation based on the comparison results 3 results 3 1 nitrogen removal performance of the pd a system 3 1 1 long term nitrogen removal performance the system was divided into three phases i biofilm ii biofilm ss and iii biofilm during phase i 1 28 days the nitrogen removal performance of the system tended to be stable after day 10 and the total inorganic nitrogen tin removal efficiency was 89 9 3 0 fig 1 d specially the nh4 n removal efficiency was 94 6 5 2 fig 1a and the effluent nitrogen was mainly no3 n 4 0 1 2 mg n l during phase ii 29 57 days ss was introduced to form a mixed ss biofilm system the tin removal efficiency decreased to 70 2 7 2 specifically the removal performance of no3 n and nh4 n responded rapidly with the no3 n removal efficiency increasing to 98 8 1 3 fig 1c and the nh4 removal performance deteriorating and fluctuating significantly 39 8 16 6 the cod removal performance deteriorated fig s2 accompanied by accumulation of a certain amount of effluent no2 n 1 4 1 1 mg n l fig 1b based on the high no3 n removal efficiency and effluent cod it can be speculated that the introduction of ss caused mild fermentation thereby providing some available organic matter for nitrogen removal after the ss was discharged in phase iii 58 110 days the nh4 n removal efficiency quickly recovered to that of phase i and the removal efficiency increased and then stabilized at 98 7 1 8 in the last 20 days the effluent no3 n increased to 7 6 2 1 mg n l resulting in a lower tin removal efficiency 83 2 5 1 compared with phase i in summary the tin and nh4 n removal performances first decreased and then increased while the no3 n removal efficiency and effluent no2 n concentration first increased and then decreased this study mainly employed two different nitrogen removal pathways namely denitrification and anammox during phase i anammox was the main nitrogen removal pathway contributing to 83 8 6 5 nitrogen removal fig 1d however the main nitrogen removal pathway transformed from anammox to denitrification 51 3 17 0 after introducing ss in phase ii during phase iii the contribution of anammox to nitrogen removal increased to 89 1 7 0 by removing ss 3 1 2 typical characteristics of the nitrogen removal process typical cycles days 18 52 and 110 during the stable operation period of different phases were investigated fig 2 during phase i a rapid decrease in no3 and accumulation of no2 with a peak value of 6 9 mg n l was observed during the first 30 min fig 2a the nh4 and no2 concentrations then decreased synchronously with nh4 n decreasing from 9 9 mg n l to 0 1 mg n l after 4 h in phase ii with the mixed ss biofilm nh4 n only decreased by 5 3 mg n l within 4 h and this lower removal efficiency led to continuous nh4 accumulation in the system fig 2b conversely the no3 n removal efficiency increased relatively specifically the peak no2 n value only reached 2 9 mg n l by 20 min and denitrification was completed over 60 min which was much faster than in phase i after the biofilm only system was restored in phase iii the typical characteristics of this phase were highly similar to phase i fig 2c no2 n peaked in the first 30 min while nh4 n had no obvious change over the following 3 5 h nh4 n concentration dropped from 9 5 mg n l to below the detection limit and the removal efficiency slightly increased compared with phase i in conclusion the typical cycles of phases i and iii were highly similar whereas phase ii had a higher no3 n removal efficiency with less no2 n accumulation and the nh4 removal performance was poor in addition the typical ph cycle of each phase showed special regularity with nitrogen conversion the ph curve of phases i and iii showed a trend of first rising and then falling fig 2a and 2c at 30 min the ph and no2 synchronously peaked that is the ph peak and no2 peak had a notable correlation in phase ii the ph peak was associated with two processes fig 2b specifically ph peak a still appeared synchronously with the peak no2 value while ph peak value b appeared synchronously with the completion of no3 removal at 60 min since the other operating conditions remained unchanged it can be inferred that this observation was related to the switch between ss biofilm or biofilms only status 3 2 microbial activity of anoxic biofilms during different phases batch tests revealed changes in the microbial pd a activity during each phase table 1 with extension of the acclimation time phase i phase ii phase iii the nh4 removal efficiency was 70 3 day 28 87 9 day 57 and then to 92 3 day 110 respectively this may be related to optimization of the microbial community structure or the characteristics of the anoxic carrier biofilm however the no3 removal efficiency first increased and then decreased specifically the no3 removal efficiency increased to 100 at the end of phase ii and then decreased after discharging the ss to 78 3 which was higher than that of phase i 52 49 in addition the nh4 and no3 removal rates showed increasing trend after phase ii and phase iii in particular the rapid removal time decreased from 2 h to 1 h after the acclimation of ss thus after switching the ss mode from presence to absence the anammox activity of the domesticated biofilm of phase iii was significantly enhanced and the autotrophic nitrogen removal efficiency was significantly higher than that in phase i 3 3 variations in the microbial distribution structure and functional genes 3 3 1 spatial distribution of anammox clsm fish analysis showed that the spatial distribution of anammox bacteria in this system changed dynamically with the presence of ss fig s3 at the end of phase i anammox bacteria were distributed in the inner layer of the biofilm after introducing ss the anammox bacteria moved to the outer layer of the biofilm by the end of phase ii however after the ss was discharged in phase iii the anammox bacteria were mixed in the biofilm and tended to populate the inner layer 3 3 2 microbial community structure based on high throughput sequencing high throughput sequencing fig s4 showed that the relative abundance of candidatus brocadia at the end of phases i ii and iii was 0 94 0 82 and 2 22 respectively the dynamic change of ss caused the abundance of anammox bacteria to first decrease and then increase thauera the dominant denitrifying bacterial genus detected in the pd a system increased from 0 29 to 30 16 after only 28 days then decreased to 18 29 in the presence of ss and finally increased to 26 67 after returning to the biofilm only system in contrast another typical denitrifying bacterium denitratisoma showed a low abundance 0 39 in phase i increased 3 10 in phase ii and then decreased 2 52 after discharging the ss in phase iii 3 3 3 nitrogen functional genes by qpcr and metagenomic sequencing the abundance of anammox and denitrification functional genes can be used to characterize the relationship equilibrium between the two processes fig 3 among the ss samples fig s5 no significant difference in functional genes was observed based on statistical tests relative to the hzsb gene anammox in the ss denitrifying functional genes were detected at far higher abundances indicating that introduced ss from the wwtp contains abundant denitrifying bacteria the abundance of the anammox functional gene hzsb in the initial inoculum and at the end of phases i ii and iii was 8 06 1010 7 29 1010 6 85 1010 and 1 53 1011 copies dry sludge respectively which is consistent with the trend detected by metagenomic sequencing fig 3 the abundances of the main denitrifying functional genes narg napa nirs and nirk in the biofilm increased significantly after domesticating with the mixed ss biofilm system in phase ii while they only decreased slightly after discharging ss in phase iii among them the abundances of napa narg nirs and nirk which are responsible for the process of converting no3 to no were much higher than that phase i despite the ss being discharged in phase iii however the lower abundance of the nosz functional gene in phase iii was undoubtedly not conducive to the subsequent transformation of no to n2 the functional genes detected by metagenomic sequencing analysis also showed a similar trend the contribution of microorganisms and functional genes was further characterized by metagenomic sequencing fig 4 anammox bacteria are generally considered to be the main contributors of hzs and hdh however it was found that the contribution of different anammox bacteria to functional genes was significantly different in this study among them candidatus brocadia sp bl1 and candidatus brocadia sapporoensis increased significantly especially during phase iii fig s6 candidatus brocadia sp bl1 not only has a high contribution to hzs and hdh its contribution to nar also cannot be ignored fig s7 candidatus brocadia sp bl1 was the dominant species in the pd a system candidatus brocadia sapporoensis is only associated with a high contribution to nar while candidatus brocadia bacterium b188 is a high contributor to nar and hdh 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism for the high enrichment of anammox bacteria within the anoxic biofilm the anoxic biofilm played a key role in ensuring the robustness of the pd a system specifically the balance of the pd a system under the dynamic changes in ss absence presence absence was accomplished through metabolic pathway transformation microbial community structure changes and the spatial distribution transformation of the anoxic biofilm thereby ensuring high enrichment of in situ anammox bacteria 4 1 1 metabolic pathway balance there are two main nitrogen removal pathways under anoxic conditions anammox and denitrification a high anammox contribution to nitrogen removal was observed in the pd a systems based on pure biofilm a previous study also showed that high total nitrogen was removed by the anammox process 90 when using corncob as a biofilm carrier zhang et al 2019a the alternating between ss absence and presence significantly strengthened the heterotrophic denitrification process allowing denitrification to become the dominant nitrogen removal pathway of the pd a system fig 1 previous studies have shown that excessive competition for no2 from the denitrification process is the main reason for a weak anammox contribution chamchoi et al 2008 however the anammox pathway in this study still supported nearly half of the nitrogen loss 48 7 17 0 in the presence of ss it can be inferred that the anoxic biofilm could balance the autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrogen removal efficiencies under the different modes in summary the anoxic biofilm improved the flexibility of nitrogen removal and made the system more resilient as the intermediate substrate the continuous supply of no2 is key to the stable enrichment of anammox bacteria firstly significant no2 peaks were observed especially in the pure biofilm system 6 9 mg n l 5 5 mg n l even under the extremely unsuitable condition of the ss biofilm system where a strong denitrification process competed for no2 accumulation of 2 9 mg n l no2 was still detected after 20 min fig 2 furthermore over the long term operation the effluent no2 n concentration increased to 1 4 1 1 mg n l thus it can be preliminarily inferred that the no3 reduction capacity was higher than the no2 reduction capacity throughout the entire process secondly the batch tests showed that the no3 reduction rates of the anoxic biofilm were notably improved 0 36 1 74 1 96 mg n g ss h and that the peak no2 values were all higher than 1 0 mg n l table 1 these batch tests further confirm that the no2 supply capacity remained at a high level throughout the whole process and was even improved after the dynamic changes in the ss status this is vital to the efficient enrichment of anammox bacteria and the balance of anammox metabolism in addition the results imply that if the ss concentration is gradually reduced the competitiveness of denitrifying bacteria for no2 might be slowly weakened and that the steady enrichment of anammox bacteria can be achieved which deserves future research attention 4 1 2 microbial balance a stable partial denitrification microbial structure is the premise of promoting anammox metabolism cui et al 2020 high throughput sequencing showed that thauera was the dominant denitrifying bacterium in this study accounting for 30 16 of the pure biofilm system thauera is often considered to be closely related to partial denitrification a previous study reported a nitrate transformation ratio of 95 8 in a thauera enriched 61 53 system du et al 2017 in this study thauera was the main functional microorganism 18 29 of the ss biofilm system the reduction capacity of no3 was much higher than that of no2 based on the biofilm only system this shows that the introduction of ss for nearly one month did not shift the dominant position of thauera in the anoxic biofilm which could still maintain the supply of no2 metagenomic sequencing and qpcr results indicate that the ability of transforming no3 to no was significantly improved while the lower nosz functional gene abundance is obviously not conducive to the subsequent denitrification process fig 3 therefore the dynamic changes in the ss status even altered the proportion of denitrifying bacteria in the anoxic biofilm furthermore the ability of anammox bacteria to supply no2 in an anoxic biofilm cannot be ignored a previous study has confirmed that candidatus brocadia is the key nar contributor to nitrate to nitrite conversion in anoxic carrier biofilms li et al 2021 however the difference between anammox species needs further attention this study further shows that the contribution of anammox species to functional genes is different and the main contributors to nar include candidatus brocadia sp bl1 yang et al 2018 2020 candidatus brocadia sapporoensis and candidatus brocadia bacterium b188 furthermore candidatus brocadia sp bl1 also had a high contribution to hzs and hdh it can be speculated that candidatus brocadia sp bl1 can use nitrate and ammonia alone to complete the anammox process therefore this characteristic may allow candidatus brocadia sp bl1 to become dominant in the pd a system the large increase of candidatus brocadia sp bl1 optimizes the proportion of anammox bacteria and has an enhancing effect on the pd a process 4 1 3 dynamic microbial distribution balance microorganisms are often distributed within different layers of a biofilm according to their survival characteristics for example schramm et al found that ammonium oxidizing bacteria were mainly distributed in the upper part of biofilm above nob schramm et al 1996 a previous study which analyzed the spatial distribution of nitrifying denitrifying and anammox bacteria in sponge biofilms from a full scale biological nutrient removal plant found that along the 7 5 mm biofilm depth microorganisms in the upper 1 3 mm were denser because it is easier to access the substrate in that region chae et al 2012 to describe the spatial distribution of microorganisms and the interaction between the anoxic biofilm and ss this study profiled the anoxic carrier biofilms based on clsm fish microbial community analysis and metabolic pathway transformation fig 5 firstly the anammox bacteria were distributed inside the biofilm of the pure biofilm system in phase i in previous study it was speculated that anammox bacteria tend to grow inside the biofilm of a pd a system li et al 2021 the spatial distribution of anammox bacteria within the inner layer of the anoxic biofilm was confirmed for the first time in this study the denitrifying bacteria on the outside of the biofilm consumed cod and do and provided no2 to the anammox bacteria on the inside therefore it can be inferred that this structure is favorable for allowing anammox bacteria to survive in the anoxic biofilm secondly introduction of the ss redistributed the spatial structure of the anammox and denitrifying bacteria in the anoxic biofilm specifically the distribution of anammox bacteria in anoxic biofilm changed from the inside to the outside previous research showed that ss can obtain substrate matrix faster than biofilm and that the slow mass transfer speed of biofilm is not advantageous for a competitive relationship pérez et al 2020 zhang et al 2019b the difference in mass transfer as well as the introduction of a large number of denitrifying genes from the ss provided a stronger and faster denitrification ability the anammox bacteria had to be transferred to the outside of the biofilm to complete the metabolic process using no2 produced by the ss in short anammox bacteria migrate outward to adapt to the environment the newly abundant anammox bacteria were also distributed outside the biofilm close to the ss lastly high throughput sequencing results show that the abundance of anammox bacteria significantly increased after the ss was drained highly enriched anammox bacteria were distributed in the space within the anoxic biofilm indicating that a portion of the anammox bacteria were transferred to the inner side of the biofilm according to the prediction of this pattern the spatial distribution of anammox and denitrifying bacteria in the anoxic biofilm tended to return to the state of phase i over the long term operation in general the use of a biofilm carrier ensured retention of the anammox bacteria and maintained their contribution to autotrophic nitrogen removal even under the adverse conditions the dynamic changes in ss mainly improved the anammox process through two aspects firstly the proportion of denitrification functional genes was optimized to decrease the abundance of no reducing functional genes which was beneficial to the competition of the anammox process secondly the ss caused outward migration of anammox bacteria in the anoxic biofilm which increased their mass transfer efficiency and improved their anammox activity finally in situ enrichment of the anammox bacteria was enhanced 4 2 novel real time ph strategy on controlling pd a process when switching between the biofilm only and ss biofilm modes fig 2 the different ph regularity on controlling pd a system was first investigated the ph curves showed the same upward trend at the beginning of the reaction the no2 n peak a and ph appeared simultaneously with the rapid degradation of cod and no3 n in this study the partial denitrification process was completed first and then the anammox reaction was carried out however in theory the process of partial denitrification should not change the ph because denitrification only produces alkalinity during no2 n reduction ge et al 2012 therefore the rapid rise in ph should not be attributed to the partial denitrification process interestingly cod did not decrease after peak a the source of cod used in this study was ch3coona which is a weak acid salt it can be speculated that the rapid degradation of ch3coona is the cause of the increased ph a similar phenomenon was reported in previous studies on the partial denitrification process du et al 2016 wang et al 2019 the ph peak a indicated the peak of the no2 based pd a system perfectly and changes in ph could be special and applicable for indicating biochemical reactions interestingly the ph curves based on the different modes showed opposite trends after peak a with the ph decreasing in the biofilm only mode previous studies showed that anammox caused a rise in ph due to the consumption of h talan et al 2021 however some studies have shown that there is a ph equilibrium point of 7 1 during the anammox process when the ph was higher than the equilibrium point it decreased soetaert et al 2007 tomaszewski et al 2017 in this study the ph was higher than 7 1 and there was a rapid downward trend in the ph curves after peak a which is consistent with the rapid degradation of nh4 and no2 therefore it can be inferred that the decrease in ph may be related to the anammox process conversely the ph curve of the mixed ss biofilm system showed a slow upward trend before peak b the competitiveness of denitrifying bacteria for no2 was enhanced after the introduction of ss however due to the relative lack of cod the variation rate of ph was relatively slow therefore the slow increase in ph was caused by the alkalinity produced during no2 n reduction implying that peak b could indicate the end of complete denitrification fig 2b importantly the strength of the no2 n matrix competition between the anammox and denitrification processes can be reflected in the trend of the ph curves during the mixing mode the no2 reduction process was dominant fig 2b the reason why the pure biofilm system did not display peak b may be that anammox had a decisive advantage over the competition for no2 so the slow rise in ph caused by no2 reduction was not seen fig 2a 2c after the end of the second section of the ph curve the ph of both modes showed a slow downward trend firstly the anammox rate decreased secondly the cod increased in the later stage of the reaction and the abundance of candidatus competibacter hossain et al 2019 in the system was high overall the ph control strategy of the pd a system proposed here for the first time may be applied to practical projects in the future to control the pd a process 5 conclusion in this study the interaction mechanism between the biofilm and ss in the pd a system was systematically explored through microbial and spatial structure analysis in contrast to the significant enhancement of the no3 to no the abundance of no reducing functional genes decreased meanwhile the anammox bacteria in the biofilm transferred from the inside to the outside and then finally tended to grow inside which guaranteed the robustness of anammox bacteria the enrichment of anammox bacteria 0 82 2 22 could be attributed to the spatial movement law retention effect of the existing biofilm and the optimization of denitrification functional genes declaration of competing interest

15210,the basic premise of anammox technical application reliability in municipal wastewater treatment is substantially enriched anammox bacteria to enrich the anammox the special interaction mechanism between the suspended sludge ss and anoxic biofilm was investigated over three months in a partial denitrification anammox biosystem subjected to dynamic changes in ss absence presence absence results show that the introduction of ss significantly decreased the anammox nitrogen removal efficiency 83 8 6 5 48 7 17 0 with the presence or absence of ss the spatial distribution of anammox bacteria within the anoxic biofilm gradually changed between the inner and outer layers as detected by clsm fish qpcr and metagenomic sequencing show that changes in the presence and absence status of ss significantly reduced the abundance of the no reducing functional gene while the no supply capacity no3 no was improved further favoring the anammox process batch tests and typical cycles further demonstrated that the anammox bacteria can stably acquire no2 and anammox bacteria in the anoxic biofilm competed far more no2 than denitrifying bacteria according to the typical ph curve accordingly the abundance of candidatus brocadia as detected by high throughput sequencing decreased in the anoxic biofilms with the introduction of ss but greatly increased 0 82 2 22 after ss

reducing operating costs have accelerated the rapid transformation of traditional municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps without the need for aeration or organic carbon source anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox uses ammonium nh4 and nitrite no2 to produce n2 and is considered as a revolutionary technology in the future lin and wang 2017 ma et al 2016 yang et al 2021 ammonia is generally rich in municipal wastewater while no2 as the anammox substrate is objectively lacking and not easy to stably obtain in order to overcome this bottleneck various researchers have explored ways to acquire no2 according to the different ways of obtaining no2 anammox is mainly employed through two processes partial nitrification anammox pn a and partial denitrification anammox pd a pn a is a completely autotrophic nitrogen removal process that has the advantages of maximum energy saving and a theoretical reduction of carbon source consumption dong and sun 2007 miao et al 2018 wang et al 2010 the key to achieving partial nitrification is the effective suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nevertheless full inhibition of nob activity is still difficult wett et al 2013 and 11 of nitrate is produced by anammox li et al 2018 which will block the effluent nitrate from reaching the standard stably although the research on pn a continues to deepen pd a has recently been receiving increasing attention cao et al 2019 gao et al 2021 the pd a process combines heterotrophic autotrophic metabolism with nitrogen removal anammox driven by partial denitrification can improve the nitrogen removal efficiency by consuming residual nitrate and the subsequent no2 reduction process avoids toxicity to anammox bacteria caused by excessive no2 especially under continuous flow the use of pd a technologies in biofilm based systems has presented more powerful nitrogen removal advantages and application potential in recent years specifically activated sludge processes are often used in traditional wwtps however anammox bacteria are not easily retained or enriched in suspended sludge ss under the same sludge retention time due to their long doubling time lotti et al 2014 van der star et al 2007 biofilm based processes are considered to be effective for enriching slow growing microorganisms kosgey et al 2021 torresi et al 2016 thereby allowing for different sludge retention times considering the necessity of ss in traditional wwtps zhang et al 2021 2016 the ss biofilm mixing mode of a continuous flow system guarantees the retention of anammox bacteria in lab scale pilot scale and full scale studies partial denitrification coupled with anammox has been achieved by adding anoxic biofilm carriers in the anoxic zone of the a2o process li et al 2020 2019 zhao et al 2022 anoxic environment low dissolved oxygen do low organic carbon concentration provides extremely favorable conditions for anammox and is considered to provide the optimal theoretical conditions for anammox to occur mulder et al 1995 these studies showed that anammox bacteria could be successfully enriched in the mixed ss biofilm system and that the nitrogen removal efficiency is significantly improved even when the proportion of anammox bacteria is low thus it can be inferred that the introduction of anammox bacteria in the form of biofilms in the anoxic environment deserves special attention and research a low abundance of anammox bacteria has been observed in conventional wwtps units van der star et al 2007 wang et al 2015 and the anammox nitrogen removal contribution is expected to be further strengthened when focusing on improving the anammox contribution to nitrogen removal the key premise is the in situ enrichment of anammox bacteria an interesting study found that anammox bacteria were highly enriched in situ in anoxic carrier biofilm when the ss in a pd a driven a2 o system was accidentally lost li et al 2021 moreover many studies have shown that anammox bacteria have a significant niche preference for anoxic biofilm rather than ss causing ss and biofilm to have different aggregation effects on microorganisms kosgey et al 2021 li et al 2020 zheng et al 2016 therefore balancing the specific interaction relationship between biofilm and ss may provide new ideas for in situ enrichment of anammox bacteria which has never been further explored according to previous studies anammox bacteria tend to be enriched on the carriers and the loss of ss can even accelerate the in situ enrichment of anammox bacteria in the anoxic biofilm of pd a systems thus the objectives of the present study were to investigate i the contribution of autotrophic heterotrophic nitrogen removal can be optimized by adjusting the ratio of biofilm to ss in the anoxic zone and ii the in situ enrichment of anammox bacteria can be accelerated by reducing ss in order to explore the in situ enrichment mechanism of anammox bacteria by reducing ss in the anoxic zone of a pd a system a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr was successfully constructed and continuously operated over three months the microbial community structure and niche changes were analyzed in depth through 16s rrna gene sequencing metagenomic sequencing qpcr and confocal laser scanning microscopy fluorescence in situ hybridization clsm fish the results of this study are expected to provide technical and scientific support for the application of anammox in mainstream wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation this study was conducted using a mbbr made of cylindrical plexiglass with a working volume of 3 0 l fig s1 the inoculated biofilm was taken from the anoxic zone of a municipal wwtp li et al 2019 and filled into the system at a filling ratio of 40 the mbbr was operated for 2 cycles per day with a drainage ratio of 50 each cycle consists 5 min of feeding 4 h of anoxic stirring 5 min of settling time and finally 5 min of drainage the influent of the system was synthetic wastewater the influent nh4 n and no3 n concentrations of the system were determined as 20 mg n l and 32 mg n l respectively by measuring the anoxic biofilm activity before inoculation the designed cod no3 ratio of the system was 1 5 and 48 mg l sodium acetate ch3coona was added in order to ensure the system environment was strictly anoxic the do concentrations were reduced to below 0 05 mg l using high purity n2 before each operation the reaction temperature of the entire system was 25 6 1 0 c the temperature in the reactor was strictly controlled with a temperature feedback system the whole long term operation was divided into three phases phase i 1 28 days was operated in pure anoxic biofilm mode in phase ii 29 57 days the ss was introduced which represented the coexisting anoxic biofilm and ss mode in phase iii 58 110 days ss was completely discharged thus according to the ss status the reactors operated in the absence phase i then presence phase ii and finally absence phase iii of ss in the second phase the ss was inoculated from the sedimentation tank of the gaobeidian municipal wwtp beijing china the system was designed to replace the ss every 7 8 days in order to simulate the anoxic environment of the actual wwtp as well as to more strictly ensure that the ss was not domesticated and that the mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss were constant at 3000 mg l 2 2 analytical methods after filtering the wastewater samples flow injection lachat instruments milwaukee usa was used to determine the nitrogen specifically nh4 no3 no2 concentrations the cod concentrations of the wastewater samples were measured using the rapid determination method lianhua technology 5b 3b v8 mlvss of the ss was determined using an automatic moisture ash analyzer prepash 212 switzerland do ph and temperature were monitored in real time using a multichannel sensor multi 3620 wtw company germany 2 3 ex situ batch tests batch tests were used to detect the anammox and denitrification activity of the biofilm and ss of each phase before the batch tests the biofilm and ss in the main test device were washed with washing media van loosdrecht et al 2016 and then placed in a 0 5 l brown bottle as with the long term test the filling ratio of the biofilm was 40 trace elements and mineral elements table s1 were added and milli q water was used to quantify to 0 5 l prior to the anoxic batch tests n2 was pumped into the device to remove oxygen so as to avoid as much interference of oxygen on microbial activity as possible after the above pretreatment test devices were placed in a water bath shaker gfl1092 germany at a speed of 140 rpm and temperature of 30 0 0 1 c 2 4 clsm fish to explore the influence of ss on the spatial distribution of anammox bacteria in biofilms clsm fish technology was used to analyze the collected biofilm samples at the end of each phase first the biofilm carriers were washed by pbs phosphate buffered saline 130 mm sodium chloride 10 mm phosphate buffer and fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde pfa then the fixed biofilms were embedded with o c t compound sakura tissue tek a medium for frozen tissue specimens to ensure optimal cutting temperature o c t the processed biofilm carriers were placed at 80 c for 24 h after freezing the biofilm carrier the biofilm was completely separated from the carrier to obtain a complete biofilm from a single pore and the embedding agent was used again for embedding a microtome leicacm1900 cryostat was used to slice the above mentioned embedded body the slices were successively immersed in 50 80 and 96 ethanol for dehydration persson et al 2014 after completion of the above pretreatment process a hybridization buffer and probe mixture table s2 was smeared on the sample glass slide and then the samples were placed in a hybridization sampling box at 46 c for 2 h after removing the slides washing buffer with different formamide concentrations was used to wash the probe for 15 min and then 2 μl of anti fluorescence attenuator was added finally the biofilms were observed by clsm olympus fv1200 tokyo japan 2 5 dna extraction and qpcr analysis 2 5 1 dna extraction to analyze the dynamic response of microbial functional genes during each phase samples were collected of the initial biofilm inoculum and the biofilm at the end of phases i ii and iii the ss from the beginning and end of the phase ii and the initial ss from the last sludge change were also collected a freeze dryer labconco freezone plus 2 5 l usa was used to freeze dry the sludge sample after homogenization dna was extracted from 0 05 to 0 10 g of dry sludge using the fast dna spin kit for soil kit bio 101 vista ca usa following the manufacturer s instructions finally the nanodrop nd 1000 nanodrop technologies wilmington was used to quantify the dna 2 5 2 qpcr the abundance of anammox 16s rrna hzsb narg napa nirs nirk and nosz functional genes were determined by qpcr the total reaction volume was 20 μl and contained 10 μl of tb green takara dalian china 2 μl of dna forward primer reverse primer and double distilled water the reaction conditions and forward and reverse primers table s3 were based on the different target genes the qpcrs were carried out using the mx3000p real time pcr system stratagene la jolla ca usa and three biological replicates were performed for each sample in this reaction system 2 μl of dna sample was diluted to control the concentration below 100 ng and the concentration of the standard plasmid was serially diluted 10 fold to obtain a standard curve representing a 102 108 linear gradient of the gene copy number 2 6 microbiological analysis methods 2 6 1 high throughput sequencing the purpose of the high throughput analysis was to in depth analyze the dynamic response of the microbial communities from the anoxic biofilm and ss during different phases the v3 v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using the primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 amplicon sequencing was then performed using the illumina miseq pe300 platform and three biological replicates were performed

redundant gene set with the kegg gene database genes and kobas 2 0 kegg orthology based annotation system was used for functional annotation based on the comparison results 3 results 3 1 nitrogen removal performance of the pd a system 3 1 1 long term nitrogen removal performance the system was divided into three phases i biofilm ii biofilm ss and iii biofilm during phase i 1 28 days the nitrogen removal performance of the system tended to be stable after day 10 and the total inorganic nitrogen tin removal efficiency was 89 9 3 0 fig 1 d specially the nh4 n removal efficiency was 94 6 5 2 fig 1a and the effluent nitrogen was mainly no3 n 4 0 1 2 mg n l during phase ii 29 57 days ss was introduced to form a mixed ss biofilm system the tin removal efficiency decreased to 70 2 7 2 specifically the removal performance of no3 n and nh4 n responded rapidly with the no3 n removal efficiency increasing to 98 8 1 3 fig 1c and the nh4 removal performance deteriorating and fluctuating significantly 39 8 16 6 the cod removal performance deteriorated fig s2 accompanied by accumulation of a certain amount of effluent no2 n 1 4 1 1 mg n l fig 1b based on the high no3 n removal efficiency and effluent cod it can be speculated that the introduction of ss caused mild fermentation thereby providing some available organic matter for nitrogen removal after the ss was discharged in phase iii 58 110 days the nh4 n removal efficiency quickly recovered to that of phase i and the removal efficiency increased and then stabilized at 98 7 1 8 in the last 20 days the effluent no3 n increased to 7 6 2 1 mg n l resulting in a lower tin removal efficiency 83 2 5 1 compared with phase i in summary the tin and nh4 n removal performances first decreased and then increased while the no3 n removal efficiency and effluent no2 n concentration first increased and then decreased this study mainly employed two different nitrogen removal pathways namely denitrification and anammox during phase i anammox was the main nitrogen removal pathway contributing to 83 8 6 5 nitrogen removal fig 1d however the main nitrogen removal pathway transformed from anammox to denitrification 51 3 17 0 after introducing ss in phase ii during phase iii the contribution of anammox to nitrogen removal increased to 89 1 7 0 by removing ss 3 1 2 typical characteristics of the nitrogen removal process typical cycles days 18 52 and 110 during the stable operation period of different phases were investigated fig 2 during phase i a rapid decrease in no3 and accumulation of no2 with a peak value of 6 9 mg n l was observed during the first 30 min fig 2a the nh4 and no2 concentrations then decreased synchronously with nh4 n decreasing from 9 9 mg n l to 0 1 mg n l after 4 h in phase ii with the mixed ss biofilm nh4 n only decreased by 5 3 mg n l within 4 h and this lower removal efficiency led to continuous nh4 accumulation in the system fig 2b conversely the no3 n removal efficiency increased relatively specifically the peak no2 n value only reached 2 9 mg n l by 20 min and denitrification was completed over 60 min which was much faster than in phase i after the biofilm only system was restored in phase iii the typical characteristics of this phase were highly similar to phase i fig 2c no2 n peaked in the first 30 min while nh4 n had no obvious change over the following 3 5 h nh4 n concentration dropped from 9 5 mg n l to below the detection limit and the removal efficiency slightly increased compared with phase i in conclusion the typical cycles of phases i and iii were highly similar whereas phase ii had a higher no3 n removal efficiency with less no2 n accumulation and the nh4 removal performance was poor in addition the typical ph cycle of each phase showed special regularity with nitrogen conversion the ph curve of phases i and iii showed a trend of first rising and then falling fig 2a and 2c at 30 min the ph and no2 synchronously peaked that is the ph peak and no2 peak had a notable correlation in phase ii the ph peak was associated with two processes fig 2b specifically ph peak a still appeared synchronously with the peak no2 value while ph peak value b appeared synchronously with the completion of no3 removal at 60 min since the other operating conditions remained unchanged it can be inferred that this observation was related to the switch between ss biofilm or biofilms only status 3 2 microbial activity of anoxic biofilms during different phases batch tests revealed changes in the microbial pd a activity during each phase table 1 with extension of the acclimation time phase i phase ii phase iii the nh4 removal efficiency was 70 3 day 28 87 9 day 57 and then to 92 3 day 110 respectively this may be related to optimization of the microbial community structure or the characteristics of the anoxic carrier biofilm however the no3 removal efficiency first increased and then decreased specifically the no3 removal efficiency increased to 100 at the end of phase ii and then decreased after discharging the ss to 78 3 which was higher than that of phase i 52 49 in addition the nh4 and no3 removal rates showed increasing trend after phase ii and phase iii in particular the rapid removal time decreased from 2 h to 1 h after the acclimation of ss thus after switching the ss mode from presence to absence the anammox activity of the domesticated biofilm of phase iii was significantly enhanced and the autotrophic nitrogen removal efficiency was significantly higher than that in phase i 3 3 variations in the microbial distribution structure and functional genes 3 3 1 spatial distribution of anammox clsm fish analysis showed that the spatial distribution of anammox bacteria in this system changed dynamically with the presence of ss fig s3 at the end of phase i anammox bacteria were distributed in the inner layer of the biofilm after introducing ss the anammox bacteria moved to the outer layer of the biofilm by the end of phase ii however after the ss was discharged in phase iii the anammox bacteria were mixed in the biofilm and tended to populate the inner layer 3 3 2 microbial community structure based on high throughput sequencing high throughput sequencing fig s4 showed that the relative abundance of candidatus brocadia at the end of phases i ii and iii was 0 94 0 82 and 2 22 respectively the dynamic change of ss caused the abundance of anammox bacteria to first decrease and then increase thauera the dominant denitrifying bacterial genus detected in the pd a system increased from 0 29 to 30 16 after only 28 days then decreased to 18 29 in the presence of ss and finally increased to 26 67 after returning to the biofilm only system in contrast another typical denitrifying bacterium denitratisoma showed a low abundance 0 39 in phase i increased 3 10 in phase ii and then decreased 2 52 after discharging the ss in phase iii 3 3 3 nitrogen functional genes by qpcr and metagenomic sequencing the abundance of anammox and denitrification functional genes can be used to characterize the relationship equilibrium between the two processes fig 3 among the ss samples fig s5 no significant difference in functional genes was observed based on statistical tests relative to the hzsb gene anammox in the ss denitrifying functional genes were detected at far higher abundances indicating that introduced ss from the wwtp contains abundant denitrifying bacteria the abundance of the anammox functional gene hzsb in the initial inoculum and at the end of phases i ii and iii was 8 06 1010 7 29 1010 6 85 1010 and 1 53 1011 copies dry sludge respectively which is consistent with the trend detected by metagenomic sequencing fig 3 the abundances of the main denitrifying functional genes narg napa nirs and nirk in the biofilm increased significantly after domesticating with the mixed ss biofilm system in phase ii while they only decreased slightly after discharging ss in phase iii among them the abundances of napa narg nirs and nirk which are responsible for the process of converting no3 to no were much higher than that phase i despite the ss being discharged in phase iii however the lower abundance of the nosz functional gene in phase iii was undoubtedly not conducive to the subsequent transformation of no to n2 the functional genes detected by metagenomic sequencing analysis also showed a similar trend the contribution of microorganisms and functional genes was further characterized by metagenomic sequencing fig 4 anammox bacteria are generally considered to be the main contributors of hzs and hdh however it was found that the contribution of different anammox bacteria to functional genes was significantly different in this study among them candidatus brocadia sp bl1 and candidatus brocadia sapporoensis increased significantly especially during phase iii fig s6 candidatus brocadia sp bl1 not only has a high contribution to hzs and hdh its contribution to nar also cannot be ignored fig s7 candidatus brocadia sp bl1 was the dominant species in the pd a system candidatus brocadia sapporoensis is only associated with a high contribution to nar while candidatus brocadia bacterium b188 is a high contributor to nar and hdh 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism for the high enrichment of anammox bacteria within the anoxic biofilm the anoxic biofilm played a key role in ensuring the robustness of the pd a system specifically the balance of the pd a system under the dynamic changes in ss absence presence absence was accomplished through metabolic pathway transformation microbial community structure changes and the spatial distribution transformation of the anoxic biofilm thereby ensuring high enrichment of in situ anammox bacteria 4 1 1 metabolic pathway balance there are two main nitrogen removal pathways under anoxic conditions anammox and denitrification a high anammox contribution to nitrogen removal was observed in the pd a systems based on pure biofilm a previous study also showed that high total nitrogen was removed by the anammox process 90 when using corncob as a biofilm carrier zhang et al 2019a the alternating between ss absence and presence significantly strengthened the heterotrophic denitrification process allowing denitrification to become the dominant nitrogen removal pathway of the pd a system fig 1 previous studies have shown that excessive competition for no2 from the denitrification process is the main reason for a weak anammox contribution chamchoi et al 2008 however the anammox pathway in this study still supported nearly half of the nitrogen loss 48 7 17 0 in the presence of ss it can be inferred that the anoxic biofilm could balance the autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrogen removal efficiencies under the different modes in summary the anoxic biofilm improved the flexibility of nitrogen removal and made the system more resilient as the intermediate substrate the continuous supply of no2 is key to the stable enrichment of anammox bacteria firstly significant no2 peaks were observed especially in the pure biofilm system 6 9 mg n l 5 5 mg n l even under the extremely unsuitable condition of the ss biofilm system where a strong denitrification process competed for no2 accumulation of 2 9 mg n l no2 was still detected after 20 min fig 2 furthermore over the long term operation the effluent no2 n concentration increased to 1 4 1 1 mg n l thus it can be preliminarily inferred that the no3 reduction capacity was higher than the no2 reduction capacity throughout the entire process secondly the batch tests showed that the no3 reduction rates of the anoxic biofilm were notably improved 0 36 1 74 1 96 mg n g ss h and that the peak no2 values were all higher than 1 0 mg n l table 1 these batch tests further confirm that the no2 supply capacity remained at a high level throughout the whole process and was even improved after the dynamic changes in the ss status this is vital to the efficient enrichment of anammox bacteria and the balance of anammox metabolism in addition the results imply that if the ss concentration is gradually reduced the competitiveness of denitrifying bacteria for no2 might be slowly weakened and that the steady enrichment of anammox bacteria can be achieved which deserves future research attention 4 1 2 microbial balance a stable partial denitrification microbial structure is the premise of promoting anammox metabolism cui et al 2020 high throughput sequencing showed that thauera was the dominant denitrifying bacterium in this study accounting for 30 16 of the pure biofilm system thauera is often considered to be closely related to partial denitrification a previous study reported a nitrate transformation ratio of 95 8 in a thauera enriched 61 53 system du et al 2017 in this study thauera was the main functional microorganism 18 29 of the ss biofilm system the reduction capacity of no3 was much higher than that of no2 based on the biofilm only system this shows that the introduction of ss for nearly one month did not shift the dominant position of thauera in the anoxic biofilm which could still maintain the supply of no2 metagenomic sequencing and qpcr results indicate that the ability of transforming no3 to no was significantly improved while the lower nosz functional gene abundance is obviously not conducive to the subsequent denitrification process fig 3 therefore the dynamic changes in the ss status even altered the proportion of denitrifying bacteria in the anoxic biofilm furthermore the ability of anammox bacteria to supply no2 in an anoxic biofilm cannot be ignored a previous study has confirmed that candidatus brocadia is the key nar contributor to nitrate to nitrite conversion in anoxic carrier biofilms li et al 2021 however the difference between anammox species needs further attention this study further shows that the contribution of anammox species to functional genes is different and the main contributors to nar include candidatus brocadia sp bl1 yang et al 2018 2020 candidatus brocadia sapporoensis and candidatus brocadia bacterium b188 furthermore candidatus brocadia sp bl1 also had a high contribution to hzs and hdh it can be speculated that candidatus brocadia sp bl1 can use nitrate and ammonia alone to complete the anammox process therefore this characteristic may allow candidatus brocadia sp bl1 to become dominant in the pd a system the large increase of candidatus brocadia sp bl1 optimizes the proportion of anammox bacteria and has an enhancing effect on the pd a process 4 1 3 dynamic microbial distribution balance microorganisms are often distributed within different layers of a biofilm according to their survival characteristics for example schramm et al found that ammonium oxidizing bacteria were mainly distributed in the upper part of biofilm above nob schramm et al 1996 a previous study which analyzed the spatial distribution of nitrifying denitrifying and anammox bacteria in sponge biofilms from a full scale biological nutrient removal plant found that along the 7 5 mm biofilm depth microorganisms in the upper 1 3 mm were denser because it is easier to access the substrate in that region chae et al 2012 to describe the spatial distribution of microorganisms and the interaction between the anoxic biofilm and ss this study profiled the anoxic carrier biofilms based on clsm fish microbial community analysis and metabolic pathway transformation fig 5 firstly the anammox bacteria were distributed inside the biofilm of the pure biofilm system in phase i in previous study it was speculated that anammox bacteria tend to grow inside the biofilm of a pd a system li et al 2021 the spatial distribution of anammox bacteria within the inner layer of the anoxic biofilm was confirmed for the first time in this study the denitrifying bacteria on the outside of the biofilm consumed cod and do and provided no2 to the anammox bacteria on the inside therefore it can be inferred that this structure is favorable for allowing anammox bacteria to survive in the anoxic biofilm secondly introduction of the ss redistributed the spatial structure of the anammox and denitrifying bacteria in the anoxic biofilm specifically the distribution of anammox bacteria in anoxic biofilm changed from the inside to the outside previous research showed that ss can obtain substrate matrix faster than biofilm and that the slow mass transfer speed of biofilm is not advantageous for a competitive relationship pérez et al 2020 zhang et al 2019b the difference in mass transfer as well as the introduction of a large number of denitrifying genes from the ss provided a stronger and faster denitrification ability the anammox bacteria had to be transferred to the outside of the biofilm to complete the metabolic process using no2 produced by the ss in short anammox bacteria migrate outward to adapt to the environment the newly abundant anammox bacteria were also distributed outside the biofilm close to the ss lastly high throughput sequencing results show that the abundance of anammox bacteria significantly increased after the ss was drained highly enriched anammox bacteria were distributed in the space within the anoxic biofilm indicating that a portion of the anammox bacteria were transferred to the inner side of the biofilm according to the prediction of this pattern the spatial distribution of anammox and denitrifying bacteria in the anoxic biofilm tended to return to the state of phase i over the long term operation in general the use of a biofilm carrier ensured retention of the anammox bacteria and maintained their contribution to autotrophic nitrogen removal even under the adverse conditions the dynamic changes in ss mainly improved the anammox process through two aspects firstly the proportion of denitrification functional genes was optimized to decrease the abundance of no reducing functional genes which was beneficial to the competition of the anammox process secondly the ss caused outward migration of anammox bacteria in the anoxic biofilm which increased their mass transfer efficiency and improved their anammox activity finally in situ enrichment of the anammox bacteria was enhanced 4 2 novel real time ph strategy on controlling pd a process when switching between the biofilm only and ss biofilm modes fig 2 the different ph regularity on controlling pd a system was first investigated the ph curves showed the same upward trend at the beginning of the reaction the no2 n peak a and ph appeared simultaneously with the rapid degradation of cod and no3 n in this study the partial denitrification process was completed first and then the anammox reaction was carried out however in theory the process of partial denitrification should not change the ph because denitrification only produces alkalinity during no2 n reduction ge et al 2012 therefore the rapid rise in ph should not be attributed to the partial denitrification process interestingly cod did not decrease after peak a the source of cod used in this study was ch3coona which is a weak acid salt it can be speculated that the rapid degradation of ch3coona is the cause of the increased ph a similar phenomenon was reported in previous studies on the partial denitrification process du et al 2016 wang et al 2019 the ph peak a indicated the peak of the no2 based pd a system perfectly and changes in ph could be special and applicable for indicating biochemical reactions interestingly the ph curves based on the different modes showed opposite trends after peak a with the ph decreasing in the biofilm only mode previous studies showed that anammox caused a rise in ph due to the consumption of h talan et al 2021 however some studies have shown that there is a ph equilibrium point of 7 1 during the anammox process when the ph was higher than the equilibrium point it decreased soetaert et al 2007 tomaszewski et al 2017 in this study the ph was higher than 7 1 and there was a rapid downward trend in the ph curves after peak a which is consistent with the rapid degradation of nh4 and no2 therefore it can be inferred that the decrease in ph may be related to the anammox process conversely the ph curve of the mixed ss biofilm system showed a slow upward trend before peak b the competitiveness of denitrifying bacteria for no2 was enhanced after the introduction of ss however due to the relative lack of cod the variation rate of ph was relatively slow therefore the slow increase in ph was caused by the alkalinity produced during no2 n reduction implying that peak b could indicate the end of complete denitrification fig 2b importantly the strength of the no2 n matrix competition between the anammox and denitrification processes can be reflected in the trend of the ph curves during the mixing mode the no2 reduction process was dominant fig 2b the reason why the pure biofilm system did not display peak b may be that anammox had a decisive advantage over the competition for no2 so the slow rise in ph caused by no2 reduction was not seen fig 2a 2c after the end of the second section of the ph curve the ph of both modes showed a slow downward trend firstly the anammox rate decreased secondly the cod increased in the later stage of the reaction and the abundance of candidatus competibacter hossain et al 2019 in the system was high overall the ph control strategy of the pd a system proposed here for the first time may be applied to practical projects in the future to control the pd a process 5 conclusion in this study the interaction mechanism between the biofilm and ss in the pd a system was systematically explored through microbial and spatial structure analysis in contrast to the significant enhancement of the no3 to no the abundance of no reducing functional genes decreased meanwhile the anammox bacteria in the biofilm transferred from the inside to the outside and then finally tended to grow inside which guaranteed the robustness of anammox bacteria the enrichment of anammox bacteria 0 82 2 22 could be attributed to the spatial movement law retention effect of the existing biofilm and the optimization of denitrification functional genes declaration of competing interest

15211,membrane fouling was still a challenge for the potential application of forward osmosis fo in algae dewatering in this study the fouling behaviors of chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus obliquus were compared in the fo membrane filtration process and the roles of their soluble extracellular polymeric substances seps and bound eps beps in fouling performance were investigated the results showed that fouling behaviors could be divided into two stages including a quickly dropped and later a stable process the beps of both species presented the highest flux decline about 40 0 by comparison with their seps cells and broth this performance was consistent with the largest dissolved organic carbon losses in feed solutions and the highest interfacial free energy analyzed by the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory the chemical characterizations of algal foulants further showed that the severe fouling performance was also consistent with a proper ratio of carbohydrates and proteins contents in the cake layer as well as the higher low molecular weight lmw components compared with the beps the seps was crucial for the membrane fouling of s obliquus and an evolution of the membrane fouling structure was found in both species at the later filtration stage this work clearly revealed the fundamental mechanism of fo membrane fouling caused by real microalgal suspension and it will improve our understanding of the evolutionary fouling performances of algal eps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microalgae dewatering extracellular polymeric substances forward osmosis membrane fouling thermodynamic analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microalgae have gained increasing attention in value added biomass production water treatment and harmful algal bloom aziz et al 2022 razzak et al 2013 yin et al 2020 although algae dewatering is undertaken via conventional technologies i e sedimentation electro chemically assisted techniques centrifugation and floatation for applications related to the water treatment and biotechnology industries these technologies would consume more energy destroy cell integrity or result in the generation of secondary pollutions aziz et al 2022 furst et al 2018 the forward osmosis fo technology had become a promising membrane based process with lower energy consumption excellent dewatering efficiency higher resistance against membrane fouling and great recovery of algae cell integrity in algae dewatering ma et al 2022 ryu et al 2022 although the membrane fouling of fo was far less than other pressure driven filtration processes it still acted as a barrier to the fo application and operation she et al 2016 inhibiting the long term operation and reducing the life span of fo membranes larronde larretche and jin 2016 the cake layer formed with algal organic matter and algal cells was the main reason for algal fouling on the fo membrane and it could alter the concentration polarization and hydraulic resistance ryu et al 2022 previous experimental works illustrated that the intracellular and extracellular polymeric substance caused more adsorptive and irreversible fouling than cells separately liu et al 2017 and our previous work found that the fast flux decline was mainly due to combined fouling between soluble algal products and algae cells zhou et al 2021 however the effect of the eps on membrane fouling was still unclear since the eps stratification theory for bound eps beps and soluble eps seps based on bound strength had been widely recognized wingender et al 1999 the in depth exploration of the role of seps and beps in algae dewatering would be key for the development and optimization of fo fouling mitigation strategies algal extracellular polymeric substance eps comprised more than 80 of total organic matter in the algal suspension seviour et al 2019 which was a complex mixture of compounds and had diverse structures contributed by the carbohydrates chain and proteins zhuang et al 2016 it was also well accepted that carbohydrates and proteins were the critical foulants for membrane fouling thus several works investigated the specific contributions of model carbohydrates i e xanthan gum carrageenan gum levan gum guar gum or model proteins i e bovine serum albumin on membrane fouling teng et al 2022 tong et al 2021 it had been revealed that the molecular structure of carbohydrates was more important than the molecular weight in membrane fouling the branch structure of carbohydrates corresponded to higher filtration resistance was due to the more disordered structure the higher viscosity and more rigid polymer backbone fujioka et al 2020 tong et al 2021 yu et al 2018 zeng et al 2022 as for model proteins it was revealed that the fouling potential of bovine serum albumin was highly controlled by the ph or ionic strength during the ultrafiltration gao et al 2018 apart from the mechanisms of individual foulants a tighter cross link structure was further reported for the ratio of bovine serum albumin to sodium alginate of 1 1 than for the ratio of 4 1 under the fo process teng et al 2022 some glycosylated proteins had been also reported in the algal suspension which was a type of combination of proteins and carbohydrates boleij et al 2018 chen et al 2021a rao et al 2020 however to the best of our knowledge only the deposition rates of proteins in algal organic matter had been reported for the significant impact on the permeate flux decline of microfiltration and ultrafiltration yu et al 2021 and the interactions between carbohydrates and proteins in real algae dewatering process was still unknown the physicochemical interactions would affect the performance of organic matter and the thermodynamic performance can normally be revealed by the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory it contains the attractive lifshitz van der waals lw lewis acid base ab and electrostatic repulsive double layer el interactions teng et al 2021 yuan et al 2019 the applications of xdlvo theory in the detailed eps fractions upon fo membrane had not been quantified therefore the xdlvo theory might provide valuable insight into the role of different eps fractions and the corresponding fouling potential of different microalgae species this study aimed to investigate the effects of the seps and the beps on the potential fouling mechanism during the fo dewatering process the flux declines for the foulants of cells seps beps and broth were compared and the seps and beps were then fully characterized by measuring the dissolved organic carbon doc proteins and carbohydrates proportions of the feed solutions after dewatering the morphology of the foulants layers was also characterized by using scanning electronic microscopy sem and atomic force microscopy afm the surface thermodynamics and colloidal interactions between cells were further analyzed through the xdlvo theory and a comprehensive fouling mechanism in microalgae dewatering was finally proposed based on the fouling performance of soluble algal products and cells in our previous work this work would further clarify the fouling evolution of the algal eps during the flux decline process 2 materials and methods 2 1 species and cultivation of microalgae microalgae used in this study were chlorella vulgaris fachb 36 and scenedesmus obliquus fachb 417 which were purchased from the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology fachb collection china these two species had been used commonly for not only bio fuel production but also co2 fixation and advanced treatment of secondary effluent in our previous work li et al 2018 lv et al 2010 ni et al 2018 shen et al 2015b 2015a zhou et al 2021 the modified selenite enrichment se medium was utilized to provide the required nutrients for algal growth the temperature was constant at 25 2 c and the continuous light illumination was controlled at 50 μmol photons m2 s the biomass of two algae was analyzed through a visible spectrophotometer hach dr3900 usa every day then the algal suspensions were collected at their late exponential growth phase for the following experiments 2 2 extraction and characterization of eps the seps solution was extracted after centrifugation of microalgal suspension at 4000 rpm and 4 c for 15 min followed by filtering through 0 45 μ m mixed cellulose ester membrane filters jinteng china the biomass was then redispersed into pbs buffer solution at the same volume as the initial suspension the cation exchange resin cer method was used for the beps extraction long et al 2009 the amount of resin used was 2 5 g of cer g biomass sigma aldrich usa and the algae cer suspension was stirred at 600 rpm for 2 5 h the solution without cer was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant filtered by 0 45 μ m membrane was then collected as the beps fig 1 finally the biomass was washed and redissolved in ultrapure water as the algal cells without eps all solutions were diluted with ultrapure water to a dissolved organic carbon doc level of 20 mg c l the proteins and carbohydrates were measured using the modified lowry method with the standard of bovine serum albumin sigma aldrich china frolund et al 1995 and the phenol sulfuric acid method using glucose as the standard felz et al 2019 respectively the doc content was measured using a total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcph japan the zeta potential of each sample was quantified by a zeta potential analyzer surpass anton paar gmbh australia the hydrophobic and hydrophilic proportions in eps were quantified by the doc content which was fractionated through the xad 7hp and xad 4 sigma aldrich usa malcolm and maccarthy 1992 briefly the samples were acidified to ph 2 initially and then were passed consecutively through the xad 7hp and xad 4 resins resin volume was 60 ml in each ϕ15 mm column the non retained sample was referred to as the hydrophilic fraction hpi the hydrophobic fraction hpo and transphilic fraction tpi were obtained from the xad 7hp and xad 4 resin back effluent which was back eluted with naoh 0 1 m 120 ml henderson et al 2008 the molecular weight mw distribution of eps was separated by the ultrafiltration cup msc050 mosu science china with ultrafiltration membranes millipore corporation usa the samples were filtered by membranes sequentially under the nitrogen gas at a constant pressure of 1 bar the permeates were collected and then quantified by doc value to obtain the content of different molecular size ranges xu and guo 2017 2 3 batch fouling tests and membrane fouling analysis the batch fo fouling tests were conducted to compare the fouling behavior among seps beps broth and cells the self made flat sheet of thin film composite membrane tfc and the fo setup conditions were the same as that used in our previous study li et al 2018 this membrane had 1 94 0 41 lmh bar pure water permeability 0 52 0 11 lmh salt permeability 289 17 μm membrane selectivity and 43 7 mv zeta potential of the active layer the membrane was placed at active layer facing feed solution al fs mode in all experiments and the tests were all operated with 1 m nacl draw solution the samples of the seps beps and broth were adjusted to 20 mg c l for feed solutions while the broth contained 4 106 cells ml additionally the weight of feed solution and draw solution were monitored in real time for the determination of permeate water flux from feed solution to draw solution the fo test setup was as shown in fig 2 the filtration resistance was calculated according to darcy s law huisman et al 1997 1 r r m r p r f δ p μ j where r r m r p r f represented the total membrane pore clogging and foulant layer resistance m 1 respectively μ represented the dynamic viscosity of permeate kpa h j represented the permeate flux l m 2 h 1 the fouling mechanisms at different filtration stages were analyzed by the cake filtration model cheng et al 2021 hermia 1982 wu 2021 2 j 2 j 0 2 1 j 0 2 k c t where t was the filtration time h j 0 represented the initial filtration flux k c represented the cake filtration model constant plotting filtration resistance versus time could be used to evaluate the fouling process the normalized flux decline rate was calculated as follows 3 d j d t j n j 0 n j 0 n δ t where j 0 n was the permeate flux at the initial of a stage and j n was the permeate flux at the end of a stage 2 4 characterization of foulant layer the foulant layers were analyzed to recognize cake layer structures and underlying mechanisms by measuring the doc carbohydrates and proteins contents of feed solutions before and after experiments the surface morphology observation was characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem su8010 hitachi japan and atomic force microscopy afm park nx10 korea respectively 2 5 interaction energy calculation based on xdlvo theory the xdlvo theory was applied to calculate the interfacial free energies of adhesion δ g m w f t o t and cohesion δ g m w f c o h chang et al 2015 these two energies could reveal the strength between foulants membrane and foulants themselves including the seps the beps cells and algal broth the calculation of interfacial free energies was based on measuring angles by using a contact angle goniometer jysp 360 beijing united test co ltd beijing china according to the standard sessile drop method chang et al 2015 the three surface tension parameters γ lw γ γ were determined through the contact angle using three probe liquids diiodomethane ultrapure water and glycerol and the foulant s surface tension based on young s equation as shown in eq 4 bouchard et al 1997 van oss and good 1988 4 1 cos θ γ l tot 2 γ s lw γ l lw γ s γ l γ s γ l the nonpolar component γ lw mj m2 which was the lifshitz van der waals interactions lw component and the polar component γ ab mj m2 which was of lewis acid base interactions ab component were components of total surface tension γ tot mj m2 as shown in eq 5 5 γ tot γ lw γ ab eq 6 showed the cohesive free energy δ g m w f c o h between organic matters 6 δ g mwf coh 2 γ f lw γ w lw 2 2 γ w 2 γ f γ w 2 γ w 2 γ f γ w 4 γ f γ w eq 7 showed the adhesive free energy between the surfaces and organic

t mj m2 was the total free energy of adhesion δ g m w f l w mj m2 δ g m w f a b mj m2 and δ g m w f e l represented the lewis acid base interactions ab component lifshitz van der waals interactions lw component and electrical double layer el component of the total free energy of adhesion respectively m w f in the subscript represented membrane water and foulants as shown in eq 6 the el component was ignored i e the effect of the el component on the surface free energy was negligible since the el component value was found too low to be compared with the ab component and lw component as shown in our previous work zhou et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 water flux performances of different foulants the normalized flux declines of algal cells seps beps and broth were illustrated in fig 3 and the concentration factor of both species were calculated to be almost the same 1 786 for c vulgaris and 1 803 for s obliquus the beps foulants showed the highest flux decline compared with other foulants and it decreased by 42 9 and 37 4 for c vulgaris and s obliquus during the total 5 h filtration respectively additionally the flux of beps dropped almost linearly throughout the whole fouling process by contrast the fluxes of other foulants displayed a stable trend at later filtration stage those results demonstrated that the beps had evoked the highest flux decline among the algal broth as shown in fig 3 it was noticed that the fluxes were almost steady at later time and after 150 min the whole fouling rates of c vulgaris followed the order beps broth cells seps whereas that of s obliquus was beps broth seps cells the higher fouling rates of cells had been reported for c vulgaris in our previous work and it was mostly due to the small and regular morphology of cells zhou et al 2021 however the decline rate of cells for s obliquus was found still overlapped with the baseline all the time indicating that its cells were not the main fouling factor for the filtration process the seps derived from both species showed different fouling behaviors for c vulgaris the relative flux curve of seps was far away from the broth and then was found to overlap with the decline of cells after 150 min by contrast the flux reduction rate of seps for s obliquus was almost the same as that of the broth indicating the seps fraction of s obliquus caused the highest flux reduction at the later filtration process to identify the specific fouling stage the fluxes were further analyzed by the cake filtration model eq 2 and the whole process of which was divided into the initial fig 4 a c and the later stages fig 4 b d these two stages had different magnitude of filtration resistance such as the resistance of the beps for c vulgaris was significantly increased from r2 at 0 min 0 00074 m 2 to r2 at 300 min 0 00229 m 2 unlike other components the changes of filtration resistance rate of beps at later process were increased than that at the initial as indicated by the slope from 4 56 10 6 to 5 21 10 6 illustrating that the fouling layer structure had been changed into much compactly and quickly given the short duration of the initial stage 0 60 min the resistance of c vulgaris was followed as beps broth cells seps fig 4 a and that of s obliquus was beps broth seps cells fig 4 c which were all similar to their flux behaviors fig 3 like the flux behavior of beps for c vulgaris in fig 3 a the filtration resistance of cells broth and beps were almost similar with those in their initial stage indicating that the resistance of cells for c vulgaris was high initially by which importance of cells for c vulgaris was further proved for the later stage 60 300 min the resistance for c vulgaris was followed as beps broth cells seps fig 4 b whereas that of s obliquus was followed as beps broth seps cells fig 4 d specifically within the whole operation time the beps had the highest filtration resistance the rate of which was found increased during the whole process by contrast the performances of the seps for two species were different for example the seps for c vulgaris showed the lowest filtration resistance whereas that of the seps for s obliquus was higher than that of cells initially and then was equal to that of the broth these batch fouling tests revealed two noteworthy fouling behaviors including that the beps had shown significantly the highest fouling potential and the seps played different roles in the dewatering process of c vulgaris and s obliquus suspensions to know more about the differences between these two algal species the properties of the fouling layer were then characterized 3 2 chemical compositions and morphology of the fouling layer to gain more insight into the effect of feed solution on membrane fouling the loss of three foulant components including carbohydrates proteins and doc were then characterized for the seps beps and broth after fo test as shown in fig 5 the bar charts in fig 5 exhibited the losses of carbohydrates and proteins in the feed solutions and the pie charts exhibited their mass proportions in the cake layer compared to the losses of seps and broth the beps for c vulgaris and s obliquus both exhibited the highest losses as well as the highest fouling potential as shown in figs 3 and 4 according to the flory huggins theory the cross linked networks in the beps would well be bounded with amounts of water to form a non porous structure with an increased entropy forming a denser layer with amounts of bound water than other foulants chen et al 2016 teng et al 2022 the relative amounts of proteins and carbohydrates losses in the feed solution were inconsistent for c vulgaris and s obliquus for example the carbohydrates losses of beps and broth were both higher than proteins for c vulgaris fig 5 a but both were lower for s obliquus fig 5 b as expected more proteins would carry more polar groups and would increase the distance between carbohydrates chains mcclements 2006 zhang et al 2018 maintaining a lower energy conformation and rendering the structure of seps for c vulgaris much looser and sparse long et al 2021 teng et al 2022 as shown in the pie charts of fig 5 the mass proportions of carbohydrates were 65 75 in layers of the beps for both species and the seps for s obliquus which were all consistent with their obvious flux declines as shown in fig 3 this proper ratio of carbohydrates to proteins might strengthen and stabilize the eps matrix in this fo based dewatering whereas a slight flux decline of the seps for c vulgaris was mainly related with its lower ratio of carbohydrates in fouling layer when eps formed a gel layer on the fo membrane the more protein would increase the polarity between gel skeletons thus making the gel layer sparser teng et al 2022 mcclements 2006 furthermore the carbohydrate molecules connected mostly with covalent junctions to protein chains were generally called glycoproteins the glycoproteins had been believed to be established in the algal extracellular matrix and were involved in the cell adhesion mechanism chen et al 2021 palacio lópez et al 2019 indicating the possible interactions between carbohydrates and proteins fig 6 illustrated the surface morphology of the fo membrane observed by scanning electronic microscopy sem and atomic force microscopy afm it showed remarkable discrepancies in the density and distribution of the seps and the beps on the membrane surface it had been reported that the permeate fluxes were mostly due to the porosity and thickness of the algal cake layer ryu et al 2022 the thickness and roughness of the beps in afm images were found higher than that of seps showing the more severe fo membrane fouling for beps moreover the z range of the seps for c vulgaris was the lowest image z range was 431 0 nm fig 6 b corresponding to the lowest flux decline in fig 3 a since membrane morphology analysis only provided a qualitative interpretation further chemical properties and detailed components of the seps and the beps for both algae species were then characterized to gain deeper insight into the fouling layer 3 3 composition and characteristics of eps the characteristics of seps and beps of c vulgaris had been measured in our previous work ji et al 2021 the molecular weight mw distributions and the hydrophobic hydrophilic properties of both foulants were further characterized and compared for c vulgaris and s obliquus in this work the mw distributions of the seps and beps were illustrated in fig 7 a it was found that the distributions of the beps of both species contained more low molecular weight lmw fractions 1 k da the lmw of beps for c vulgaris accounted for 31 45 and that for s obliquus accounted for 40 44 this lmw fraction represented the intermediate products of metabolism such as hydrocarbons aldehydes glycolic acids amines and amino acids as well as mono and oligosaccharides nguyen et al 2005 in general lmw fractions were easily adsorbed onto the material surface and formed an irreversible adhesion on the membrane qu et al 2012 and rao et al 2020 had revealed that 27 distinct proteins in c vulgaris were predominantly the lmw around 5 25 kda by contrast it was identified that the hmw fractions could facilitate the formation of large and compact flocs especially for the fraction with the molecular weight higher than 30 k da cai et al 2021 the percentages of hydrophobic hpo transphilic tpi and hydrophilic hpi fractions of the seps and beps were illustrated in fig 7 b apart from the seps of c vulgaris other eps had higher hpo fractions and thus showed a hydrophobic characteristic due to the hydrophobicity of the polyamide active layer this character could partially explain the repulsions of the seps to the fo membrane for c vulgaris rendering a slighter flux decline in fig 3 a generally the hpo fraction included proteins hydrocarbons high mw alkyl amines aromatic acids phenols and humic substances etc whereas the hpi fractions were believed to contain carbohydrates hydroxy acids sulfonics amino acids lmw alkyl alcohols aldehydes and ketones etc edzwald 1993 the total concentration of carbohydrates and proteins as well as the hpo tpi and hpi concentrations in carbohydrates and proteins were shown in fig 8 firstly the content of carbohydrates was the same as proteins 62 4 mg l and 64 mg l of the beps for c vulgaris whereas the content of proteins 54 7 mg l was much higher than carbohydrates 30 5 mg l of the beps for s obliquus the seps for s obliquus was also dominated by proteins but the content of total carbohydrates was higher for the seps of c vulgaris 120 0 mg l furthermore the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity properties were also various in carbohydrates and proteins the beps of both species showed higher tpi concentrations in carbohydrates but showed higher hpo and hpi for c vulgaris and s obliquus in proteins respectively the carbohydrates in seps showed higher hpi 58 6 mg l than hpo 33 1 mg l for c vulgaris but higher hpo 33 0 mg l than hpi 6 2 mg l for s obliquus the proteins in the seps of both species showed much higher hpo concentrations nevertheless it was still difficult to quantitatively determine the membrane fouling from the properties of foulants therefore the thermodynamics analysis of membrane fouling was further evaluated 3 4 thermodynamic mechanisms of membrane fouling to characterize the different foulants physicochemical properties on the fo membrane the thermodynamic analysis coupled with the xdlvo theory was further adopted the surface contact angle and zeta potential of the cells the seps the beps and the broth were measured for calculating the interfacial interactions between the foulants and the membrane the adhesion energies δ g m w f t o t and the cohesion energies δ g m w f c o h of four foulants for c vulgaris and s obliquus were calculated by using the xdlvo theory as shown in table 1 all energy values of foulants were negative showing an attractive potential to the membrane meanwhile all foulants were dominated by the lewis acid base interactions thus making the δ g m w f a b as the dominating contributor to δ g m w f t o t the absolute δ g m w f t o t and δ g m w f c o h values of the seps the beps and the broth for s obliquus were much higher than that for the c vulgaris indicating s obliquus had higher attractions between membrane surfaces and foulants only attractions of cells with c vulgaris were higher than that of s obliquus indicating the deposition rates of cells for c vulgaris were faster than the s obliquus as shown in fig 9 it was illustrated the absolute energies order of beps broth cells seps for c vulgaris was different from that of beps broth seps cells for s obliquus the most negative values of the beps for both species revealed the highest attractive potential among these foulants the lowest negative propensity of energy for the cells of s obliquus led to the lightest fouling propensity on the membrane in this way the energy potentials in fig 9 reflected the consistent fouling potentials for those foulants as shown in fig 3 the linear correlations between the energy and normalized flux decline rate at the first 60 min and after 60 min were further presented as shown in fig 10 although the chemical characteristics and the structure of the seps and the beps were different from each other the linear relationships between flux decline and adhesion energy were well fitted r 2 0 9943 0 9555 0 9985 and 0 9829 the good prediction of the algae dewatering performances with thermodynamics analysis indicated that the fouling process was predominated by the thermodynamic effects the transformation of flux decline rates for both species had also been clearly shown in fig 10 in terms of the beps pink points in figure δ j j 0 t at the later stage were all smaller than that at the initial stage for example the δ j j 0 t of beps was decreased from 0 35 h 1 fig 10 a1 to 0 25 h 1 fig 10 a2 for c vulgaris and that was decreased from 0 45 h 1 to 0 26 h 1 for the s obliquus this indicated that the resistance of the fouling layer for the beps was enhanced the quantification of interfacial interactions could help us to comprehend the adhesion and the cohesive fouling process of the fo separation the fouling structural evolution of the beps and the seps were the essential reason for their different fouling behaviors in microalgae dewatering 3 5 interpretation of the fouling mechanisms in microalgae dewatering the above mentioned analysis including flux decline behaviors characterizations of the seps and beps and thermodynamic analysis provided detailed structural information on the cake layer a schematic diagram of the fo fouling with c vulgaris and s obliquus was proposed in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 the following points could be obtained 1 although both species were different in their cell morphology their cells were all surrounded by the internal beps and outer seps the fo fouling process of both species could be divided into two stages at 60 mins 2 at the initial stage the beps of both species showed the highest fouling decline the cells with small and regular morphology for c vulgaris would form a dense fouling layer but cells with larger and aggregates morphology for s obliquus allowed them to adhere on the membrane loosely and would not occupy the membrane surface sites the beps around cells would then strengthen the contacts between membrane and cells given that the proteins located upon the membrane and might undergo surface induced unfolding binahmed et al 2018 zhou et al 2021 3 at the later stage both species had undergone an evolution of the membrane fouling due to mainly the role of seps when the cells were deposited on the membrane surface the seps preferentially adhered to the previously fixed cells and deposited into the interspace between different particles the seps of c vulgaris would cause a slight flux decline with sparse structure branda et al 2005 nagaraj et al 2017 considering that the matrix formed with rhamnose derivatives tended to possess open water channels and was prone to be shaped into a porous structure rao et al 2020 in terms of the s obliquus its seps contained more proteins than carbohydrates and more interactions between carbohydrates and proteins would allow the formation of a dense cake layer and dominate most of the flux decline in suspension in summary the seps and the beps would all affect the fouling process in the real algal separation among all those factors the ratio and types of carbohydrates and proteins in the seps and the beps could influence their fouling behaviors the flux decline in c vulgaris suspension was mostly due to cell deposition whereas that of s obliquus suspension was mainly caused by the seps cake layer formation although the beps could partially help cells to deposit on the membrane surface initially the seps in the solution would cause the main flux reduction at the later stage this study revealed fundamental mechanisms of fo membrane fouling caused by microalgae suspension and facilitated the development of fouling control strategies such as the selections of pretreatment strategy to reduce the beps content and thus the cleaning strategy to reduce proteins upon the membrane surface 4 conclusions this study showed the underlying interaction mechanisms between the seps the beps and the cells the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the beps from c vulgaris and s obliquus both had caused the severest fouling degree on the fo membrane which could be supported by thermodynamic analysis 2 compared with the lower fouling of the seps for c vulgaris the higher proteins contents in the seps of s obliquus would cause higher membrane fouling and the interactions between carbohydrates and proteins would enhance the resistance of the cake layer 3 a synergistic effect of seps and the beps was found in the fouling process of algal rich suspension separation the cells of c vulgaris were deposited on the membrane surface and then formed a dense cell layer with the loose seps cake layer whereas for s obliquus the cells initially formed loose clusters on the fo membrane and then the seps layer formation caused higher flux decline 4 this study sheds light on the fo fouling mechanisms of the seps and

15211,membrane fouling was still a challenge for the potential application of forward osmosis fo in algae dewatering in this study the fouling behaviors of chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus obliquus were compared in the fo membrane filtration process and the roles of their soluble extracellular polymeric substances seps and bound eps beps in fouling performance were investigated the results showed that fouling behaviors could be divided into two stages including a quickly dropped and later a stable process the beps of both species presented the highest flux decline about 40 0 by comparison with their seps cells and broth this performance was consistent with the largest dissolved organic carbon losses in feed solutions and the highest interfacial free energy analyzed by the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory the chemical characterizations of algal foulants further showed that the severe fouling performance was also consistent with a proper ratio of carbohydrates and proteins contents in the cake layer as well as the higher low molecular weight lmw components compared with the beps the seps was crucial for the membrane fouling of s obliquus and an evolution of the membrane fouling structure was found in both species at the later filtration stage this work clearly revealed the fundamental mechanism of fo membrane fouling caused by real microalgal suspension and it will improve our understanding of the evolutionary fouling performances of algal eps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microalgae dewatering extracellular polymeric substances forward osmosis membrane fouling thermodynamic analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microalgae have gained increasing attention in value added biomass production water treatment and harmful algal bloom aziz et al 2022 razzak et al 2013 yin et al 2020 although algae dewatering is undertaken via conventional technologies i e sedimentation electro chemically assisted techniques centrifugation and floatation for applications related to the water treatment and biotechnology industries these technologies would consume more energy destroy cell integrity or result in the generation of secondary pollutions aziz et al 2022 furst et al 2018 the forward osmosis fo technology had become a promising membrane based process with lower energy consumption excellent dewatering efficiency higher resistance against membrane fouling and great recovery of algae cell integrity in algae dewatering ma et al 2022 ryu et al 2022 although the membrane fouling of fo was far less than other pressure driven filtration processes it still acted as a barrier to the fo application and operation she et al 2016 inhibiting the long term operation and reducing the life span of fo membranes larronde larretche and jin 2016 the cake layer formed with algal organic matter and algal cells was the main reason for algal fouling on the fo membrane and it could alter the concentration polarization and hydraulic resistance ryu et al 2022 previous experimental works illustrated that the intracellular and extracellular polymeric substance caused more adsorptive and irreversible fouling than cells separately liu et al 2017 and our previous work found that the fast flux decline was mainly due to combined fouling between soluble algal products and algae cells zhou et al 2021 however the effect of the eps on membrane fouling was still unclear since the eps stratification theory for bound eps beps and soluble eps seps based on bound strength had been widely recognized wingender et al 1999 the in depth exploration of the role of seps and beps in algae dewatering would be key for the development and optimization of fo fouling mitigation strategies algal extracellular polymeric substance eps comprised more than 80 of total organic matter in the algal suspension seviour et al 2019 which was a complex mixture of compounds and had diverse structures contributed by the carbohydrates chain and proteins zhuang et al 2016 it was also well accepted that carbohydrates and proteins were the critical foulants for membrane fouling thus several works investigated the specific contributions of model carbohydrates i e xanthan gum carrageenan gum levan gum guar gum or model proteins i e bovine serum albumin on membrane fouling teng et al 2022 tong et al 2021 it had been revealed that the molecular structure of carbohydrates was more important than the molecular weight in membrane fouling the branch structure of carbohydrates corresponded to higher filtration resistance was due to the more disordered structure the higher viscosity and more rigid polymer backbone fujioka et al 2020 tong et al 2021 yu et al 2018 zeng et al 2022 as for model proteins it was revealed that the fouling potential of bovine serum albumin was highly controlled by the ph or ionic strength during the ultrafiltration gao et al 2018 apart from the mechanisms of individual foulants a tighter cross link structure was further reported for the ratio of bovine serum albumin to sodium alginate of 1 1 than for the ratio of 4 1 under the fo process teng et al 2022 some glycosylated proteins had been also reported in the algal suspension which was a type of combination of proteins and carbohydrates boleij et al 2018 chen et al 2021a rao et al 2020 however to the best of our knowledge only the deposition rates of proteins in algal organic matter had been reported for the significant impact on the permeate flux decline of microfiltration and ultrafiltration yu et al 2021 and the interactions between carbohydrates and proteins in real algae dewatering process was still unknown the physicochemical interactions would affect the performance of organic matter and the thermodynamic performance can normally be revealed by the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory it contains the attractive lifshitz van der waals lw lewis acid base ab and electrostatic repulsive double layer el interactions teng et al 2021 yuan et al 2019 the applications of xdlvo theory in the detailed eps fractions upon fo membrane had not been quantified therefore the xdlvo theory might provide valuable insight into the role of different eps fractions and the corresponding fouling potential of different microalgae species this study aimed to investigate the effects of the seps and the beps on the potential fouling mechanism during the fo dewatering process the flux declines for the foulants of cells seps beps and broth were compared and the seps and beps were then fully characterized by measuring the dissolved organic carbon doc proteins and carbohydrates proportions of the feed solutions after dewatering the morphology of the foulants layers was also characterized by using scanning electronic microscopy sem and atomic force microscopy afm the surface thermodynamics and colloidal interactions between cells were further analyzed through the xdlvo theory and a comprehensive fouling mechanism in microalgae dewatering was finally proposed based on the fouling performance of soluble algal products and cells in our previous work this work would further clarify the fouling evolution of the algal eps during the flux decline process 2 materials and methods 2 1 species and cultivation of microalgae microalgae used in this study were chlorella vulgaris fachb 36 and scenedesmus obliquus fachb 417 which were purchased from the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology fachb collection china these two species had been used commonly for not only bio fuel production but also co2 fixation and advanced treatment of secondary effluent in our previous work li et al 2018 lv et al 2010 ni et al 2018 shen et al 2015b 2015a zhou et al 2021 the modified selenite enrichment se medium was utilized to provide the required nutrients for algal growth the temperature was constant at 25 2 c and the continuous light illumination was controlled at 50 μmol photons m2 s the biomass of two algae was analyzed through a visible spectrophotometer hach dr3900 usa every day then the algal suspensions were collected at their late exponential growth phase for the following experiments 2 2 extraction and characterization of eps the seps solution was extracted after centrifugation of microalgal suspension at 4000 rpm and 4 c for 15 min followed by filtering through 0 45 μ m mixed cellulose ester membrane filters jinteng china the biomass was then redispersed into pbs buffer solution at the same volume as the initial suspension the cation exchange resin cer method was used for the beps extraction long et al 2009 the amount of resin used was 2 5 g of cer g biomass sigma aldrich usa and the algae cer suspension was stirred at 600 rpm for 2 5 h the solution without cer was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant filtered by 0 45 μ m membrane was then collected as the beps fig 1 finally the biomass was washed and redissolved in ultrapure water as the algal cells without eps all solutions were diluted with ultrapure water to a dissolved organic carbon doc level of 20 mg c l the proteins and carbohydrates were measured using the modified lowry method with the standard of bovine serum albumin sigma aldrich china frolund et al 1995 and the phenol sulfuric acid method using glucose as the standard felz et al 2019 respectively the doc content was measured using a total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcph japan the zeta potential of each sample was quantified by a zeta potential analyzer surpass anton paar gmbh australia the hydrophobic and hydrophilic proportions in eps were quantified by the doc content which was fractionated through the xad 7hp and xad 4 sigma aldrich usa malcolm and maccarthy 1992 briefly the samples were acidified to ph 2 initially and then were passed consecutively through the xad 7hp and xad 4 resins resin volume was 60 ml in each ϕ15 mm column the non retained sample was referred to as the hydrophilic fraction hpi the hydrophobic fraction hpo and transphilic fraction tpi were obtained from the xad 7hp and xad 4 resin back effluent which was back eluted with naoh 0 1 m 120 ml henderson et al 2008 the molecular weight mw distribution of eps was separated by the ultrafiltration cup msc050 mosu science china with ultrafiltration membranes millipore corporation usa the samples were filtered by membranes sequentially under the nitrogen gas at a constant pressure of 1 bar the permeates were collected and then quantified by doc value to obtain the content of different molecular size ranges xu and guo 2017 2 3 batch fouling tests and membrane fouling analysis the batch fo fouling tests were conducted to compare the fouling behavior among seps beps broth and cells the self made flat sheet of thin film composite membrane tfc and the fo setup conditions were the same as that used in our previous study li et al 2018 this membrane had 1 94 0 41 lmh bar pure water permeability 0 52 0 11 lmh salt permeability 289 17 μm membrane selectivity and 43 7 mv zeta potential of the active layer the membrane was placed at active layer facing feed solution al fs mode in all experiments and the tests were all operated with 1 m nacl draw solution the samples of the seps beps and broth were adjusted to 20 mg c l for feed solutions while the broth contained 4 106 cells ml additionally the weight of feed solution and draw solution were monitored in real time for the determination of permeate water flux from feed solution to draw solution the fo test setup was as shown in fig 2 the filtration resistance was calculated according to darcy s law huisman et al 1997 1 r r m r p r f δ p μ j where r r m r p r f represented the total membrane pore clogging and foulant layer resistance m 1 respectively μ represented the dynamic viscosity of permeate kpa h j represented the permeate flux l m 2 h 1 the fouling mechanisms at different filtration stages were analyzed by the cake filtration model cheng et al 2021 hermia 1982 wu 2021 2 j 2 j 0 2 1 j 0 2 k c t where t was the filtration time h j 0 represented the initial filtration flux k c represented the cake filtration model constant plotting filtration resistance versus time could be used to evaluate the fouling process the normalized flux decline rate was calculated as follows 3 d j d t j n j 0 n j 0 n δ t where j 0 n was the permeate flux at the initial of a stage and j n was the permeate flux at the end of a stage 2 4 characterization of foulant layer the foulant layers were analyzed to recognize cake layer structures and underlying mechanisms by measuring the doc carbohydrates and proteins contents of feed solutions before and after experiments the surface morphology observation was characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem su8010 hitachi japan and atomic force microscopy afm park nx10 korea respectively 2 5 interaction energy calculation based on xdlvo theory the xdlvo theory was applied to calculate the interfacial free energies of adhesion δ g m w f t o t and cohesion δ g m w f c o h chang et al 2015 these two energies could reveal the strength between foulants membrane and foulants themselves including the seps the beps cells and algal broth the calculation of interfacial free energies was based on measuring angles by using a contact angle goniometer jysp 360 beijing united test co ltd beijing china according to the standard sessile drop method chang et al 2015 the three surface tension parameters γ lw γ γ were determined through the contact angle using three probe liquids diiodomethane ultrapure water and glycerol and the foulant s surface tension based on young s equation as shown in eq 4 bouchard et al 1997 van oss and good 1988 4 1 cos θ γ l tot 2 γ s lw γ l lw γ s γ l γ s γ l the nonpolar component γ lw mj m2 which was the lifshitz van der waals interactions lw component and the polar component γ ab mj m2 which was of lewis acid base interactions ab component were components of total surface tension γ tot mj m2 as shown in eq 5 5 γ tot γ lw γ ab eq 6 showed the cohesive free energy δ g m w f c o h between organic matters 6 δ g mwf coh 2 γ f lw γ w lw 2 2 γ w 2 γ f γ w 2 γ w 2 γ f γ w 4 γ f γ w eq 7 showed the adhesive free energy between the surfaces and organic

t mj m2 was the total free energy of adhesion δ g m w f l w mj m2 δ g m w f a b mj m2 and δ g m w f e l represented the lewis acid base interactions ab component lifshitz van der waals interactions lw component and electrical double layer el component of the total free energy of adhesion respectively m w f in the subscript represented membrane water and foulants as shown in eq 6 the el component was ignored i e the effect of the el component on the surface free energy was negligible since the el component value was found too low to be compared with the ab component and lw component as shown in our previous work zhou et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 water flux performances of different foulants the normalized flux declines of algal cells seps beps and broth were illustrated in fig 3 and the concentration factor of both species were calculated to be almost the same 1 786 for c vulgaris and 1 803 for s obliquus the beps foulants showed the highest flux decline compared with other foulants and it decreased by 42 9 and 37 4 for c vulgaris and s obliquus during the total 5 h filtration respectively additionally the flux of beps dropped almost linearly throughout the whole fouling process by contrast the fluxes of other foulants displayed a stable trend at later filtration stage those results demonstrated that the beps had evoked the highest flux decline among the algal broth as shown in fig 3 it was noticed that the fluxes were almost steady at later time and after 150 min the whole fouling rates of c vulgaris followed the order beps broth cells seps whereas that of s obliquus was beps broth seps cells the higher fouling rates of cells had been reported for c vulgaris in our previous work and it was mostly due to the small and regular morphology of cells zhou et al 2021 however the decline rate of cells for s obliquus was found still overlapped with the baseline all the time indicating that its cells were not the main fouling factor for the filtration process the seps derived from both species showed different fouling behaviors for c vulgaris the relative flux curve of seps was far away from the broth and then was found to overlap with the decline of cells after 150 min by contrast the flux reduction rate of seps for s obliquus was almost the same as that of the broth indicating the seps fraction of s obliquus caused the highest flux reduction at the later filtration process to identify the specific fouling stage the fluxes were further analyzed by the cake filtration model eq 2 and the whole process of which was divided into the initial fig 4 a c and the later stages fig 4 b d these two stages had different magnitude of filtration resistance such as the resistance of the beps for c vulgaris was significantly increased from r2 at 0 min 0 00074 m 2 to r2 at 300 min 0 00229 m 2 unlike other components the changes of filtration resistance rate of beps at later process were increased than that at the initial as indicated by the slope from 4 56 10 6 to 5 21 10 6 illustrating that the fouling layer structure had been changed into much compactly and quickly given the short duration of the initial stage 0 60 min the resistance of c vulgaris was followed as beps broth cells seps fig 4 a and that of s obliquus was beps broth seps cells fig 4 c which were all similar to their flux behaviors fig 3 like the flux behavior of beps for c vulgaris in fig 3 a the filtration resistance of cells broth and beps were almost similar with those in their initial stage indicating that the resistance of cells for c vulgaris was high initially by which importance of cells for c vulgaris was further proved for the later stage 60 300 min the resistance for c vulgaris was followed as beps broth cells seps fig 4 b whereas that of s obliquus was followed as beps broth seps cells fig 4 d specifically within the whole operation time the beps had the highest filtration resistance the rate of which was found increased during the whole process by contrast the performances of the seps for two species were different for example the seps for c vulgaris showed the lowest filtration resistance whereas that of the seps for s obliquus was higher than that of cells initially and then was equal to that of the broth these batch fouling tests revealed two noteworthy fouling behaviors including that the beps had shown significantly the highest fouling potential and the seps played different roles in the dewatering process of c vulgaris and s obliquus suspensions to know more about the differences between these two algal species the properties of the fouling layer were then characterized 3 2 chemical compositions and morphology of the fouling layer to gain more insight into the effect of feed solution on membrane fouling the loss of three foulant components including carbohydrates proteins and doc were then characterized for the seps beps and broth after fo test as shown in fig 5 the bar charts in fig 5 exhibited the losses of carbohydrates and proteins in the feed solutions and the pie charts exhibited their mass proportions in the cake layer compared to the losses of seps and broth the beps for c vulgaris and s obliquus both exhibited the highest losses as well as the highest fouling potential as shown in figs 3 and 4 according to the flory huggins theory the cross linked networks in the beps would well be bounded with amounts of water to form a non porous structure with an increased entropy forming a denser layer with amounts of bound water than other foulants chen et al 2016 teng et al 2022 the relative amounts of proteins and carbohydrates losses in the feed solution were inconsistent for c vulgaris and s obliquus for example the carbohydrates losses of beps and broth were both higher than proteins for c vulgaris fig 5 a but both were lower for s obliquus fig 5 b as expected more proteins would carry more polar groups and would increase the distance between carbohydrates chains mcclements 2006 zhang et al 2018 maintaining a lower energy conformation and rendering the structure of seps for c vulgaris much looser and sparse long et al 2021 teng et al 2022 as shown in the pie charts of fig 5 the mass proportions of carbohydrates were 65 75 in layers of the beps for both species and the seps for s obliquus which were all consistent with their obvious flux declines as shown in fig 3 this proper ratio of carbohydrates to proteins might strengthen and stabilize the eps matrix in this fo based dewatering whereas a slight flux decline of the seps for c vulgaris was mainly related with its lower ratio of carbohydrates in fouling layer when eps formed a gel layer on the fo membrane the more protein would increase the polarity between gel skeletons thus making the gel layer sparser teng et al 2022 mcclements 2006 furthermore the carbohydrate molecules connected mostly with covalent junctions to protein chains were generally called glycoproteins the glycoproteins had been believed to be established in the algal extracellular matrix and were involved in the cell adhesion mechanism chen et al 2021 palacio lópez et al 2019 indicating the possible interactions between carbohydrates and proteins fig 6 illustrated the surface morphology of the fo membrane observed by scanning electronic microscopy sem and atomic force microscopy afm it showed remarkable discrepancies in the density and distribution of the seps and the beps on the membrane surface it had been reported that the permeate fluxes were mostly due to the porosity and thickness of the algal cake layer ryu et al 2022 the thickness and roughness of the beps in afm images were found higher than that of seps showing the more severe fo membrane fouling for beps moreover the z range of the seps for c vulgaris was the lowest image z range was 431 0 nm fig 6 b corresponding to the lowest flux decline in fig 3 a since membrane morphology analysis only provided a qualitative interpretation further chemical properties and detailed components of the seps and the beps for both algae species were then characterized to gain deeper insight into the fouling layer 3 3 composition and characteristics of eps the characteristics of seps and beps of c vulgaris had been measured in our previous work ji et al 2021 the molecular weight mw distributions and the hydrophobic hydrophilic properties of both foulants were further characterized and compared for c vulgaris and s obliquus in this work the mw distributions of the seps and beps were illustrated in fig 7 a it was found that the distributions of the beps of both species contained more low molecular weight lmw fractions 1 k da the lmw of beps for c vulgaris accounted for 31 45 and that for s obliquus accounted for 40 44 this lmw fraction represented the intermediate products of metabolism such as hydrocarbons aldehydes glycolic acids amines and amino acids as well as mono and oligosaccharides nguyen et al 2005 in general lmw fractions were easily adsorbed onto the material surface and formed an irreversible adhesion on the membrane qu et al 2012 and rao et al 2020 had revealed that 27 distinct proteins in c vulgaris were predominantly the lmw around 5 25 kda by contrast it was identified that the hmw fractions could facilitate the formation of large and compact flocs especially for the fraction with the molecular weight higher than 30 k da cai et al 2021 the percentages of hydrophobic hpo transphilic tpi and hydrophilic hpi fractions of the seps and beps were illustrated in fig 7 b apart from the seps of c vulgaris other eps had higher hpo fractions and thus showed a hydrophobic characteristic due to the hydrophobicity of the polyamide active layer this character could partially explain the repulsions of the seps to the fo membrane for c vulgaris rendering a slighter flux decline in fig 3 a generally the hpo fraction included proteins hydrocarbons high mw alkyl amines aromatic acids phenols and humic substances etc whereas the hpi fractions were believed to contain carbohydrates hydroxy acids sulfonics amino acids lmw alkyl alcohols aldehydes and ketones etc edzwald 1993 the total concentration of carbohydrates and proteins as well as the hpo tpi and hpi concentrations in carbohydrates and proteins were shown in fig 8 firstly the content of carbohydrates was the same as proteins 62 4 mg l and 64 mg l of the beps for c vulgaris whereas the content of proteins 54 7 mg l was much higher than carbohydrates 30 5 mg l of the beps for s obliquus the seps for s obliquus was also dominated by proteins but the content of total carbohydrates was higher for the seps of c vulgaris 120 0 mg l furthermore the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity properties were also various in carbohydrates and proteins the beps of both species showed higher tpi concentrations in carbohydrates but showed higher hpo and hpi for c vulgaris and s obliquus in proteins respectively the carbohydrates in seps showed higher hpi 58 6 mg l than hpo 33 1 mg l for c vulgaris but higher hpo 33 0 mg l than hpi 6 2 mg l for s obliquus the proteins in the seps of both species showed much higher hpo concentrations nevertheless it was still difficult to quantitatively determine the membrane fouling from the properties of foulants therefore the thermodynamics analysis of membrane fouling was further evaluated 3 4 thermodynamic mechanisms of membrane fouling to characterize the different foulants physicochemical properties on the fo membrane the thermodynamic analysis coupled with the xdlvo theory was further adopted the surface contact angle and zeta potential of the cells the seps the beps and the broth were measured for calculating the interfacial interactions between the foulants and the membrane the adhesion energies δ g m w f t o t and the cohesion energies δ g m w f c o h of four foulants for c vulgaris and s obliquus were calculated by using the xdlvo theory as shown in table 1 all energy values of foulants were negative showing an attractive potential to the membrane meanwhile all foulants were dominated by the lewis acid base interactions thus making the δ g m w f a b as the dominating contributor to δ g m w f t o t the absolute δ g m w f t o t and δ g m w f c o h values of the seps the beps and the broth for s obliquus were much higher than that for the c vulgaris indicating s obliquus had higher attractions between membrane surfaces and foulants only attractions of cells with c vulgaris were higher than that of s obliquus indicating the deposition rates of cells for c vulgaris were faster than the s obliquus as shown in fig 9 it was illustrated the absolute energies order of beps broth cells seps for c vulgaris was different from that of beps broth seps cells for s obliquus the most negative values of the beps for both species revealed the highest attractive potential among these foulants the lowest negative propensity of energy for the cells of s obliquus led to the lightest fouling propensity on the membrane in this way the energy potentials in fig 9 reflected the consistent fouling potentials for those foulants as shown in fig 3 the linear correlations between the energy and normalized flux decline rate at the first 60 min and after 60 min were further presented as shown in fig 10 although the chemical characteristics and the structure of the seps and the beps were different from each other the linear relationships between flux decline and adhesion energy were well fitted r 2 0 9943 0 9555 0 9985 and 0 9829 the good prediction of the algae dewatering performances with thermodynamics analysis indicated that the fouling process was predominated by the thermodynamic effects the transformation of flux decline rates for both species had also been clearly shown in fig 10 in terms of the beps pink points in figure δ j j 0 t at the later stage were all smaller than that at the initial stage for example the δ j j 0 t of beps was decreased from 0 35 h 1 fig 10 a1 to 0 25 h 1 fig 10 a2 for c vulgaris and that was decreased from 0 45 h 1 to 0 26 h 1 for the s obliquus this indicated that the resistance of the fouling layer for the beps was enhanced the quantification of interfacial interactions could help us to comprehend the adhesion and the cohesive fouling process of the fo separation the fouling structural evolution of the beps and the seps were the essential reason for their different fouling behaviors in microalgae dewatering 3 5 interpretation of the fouling mechanisms in microalgae dewatering the above mentioned analysis including flux decline behaviors characterizations of the seps and beps and thermodynamic analysis provided detailed structural information on the cake layer a schematic diagram of the fo fouling with c vulgaris and s obliquus was proposed in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 the following points could be obtained 1 although both species were different in their cell morphology their cells were all surrounded by the internal beps and outer seps the fo fouling process of both species could be divided into two stages at 60 mins 2 at the initial stage the beps of both species showed the highest fouling decline the cells with small and regular morphology for c vulgaris would form a dense fouling layer but cells with larger and aggregates morphology for s obliquus allowed them to adhere on the membrane loosely and would not occupy the membrane surface sites the beps around cells would then strengthen the contacts between membrane and cells given that the proteins located upon the membrane and might undergo surface induced unfolding binahmed et al 2018 zhou et al 2021 3 at the later stage both species had undergone an evolution of the membrane fouling due to mainly the role of seps when the cells were deposited on the membrane surface the seps preferentially adhered to the previously fixed cells and deposited into the interspace between different particles the seps of c vulgaris would cause a slight flux decline with sparse structure branda et al 2005 nagaraj et al 2017 considering that the matrix formed with rhamnose derivatives tended to possess open water channels and was prone to be shaped into a porous structure rao et al 2020 in terms of the s obliquus its seps contained more proteins than carbohydrates and more interactions between carbohydrates and proteins would allow the formation of a dense cake layer and dominate most of the flux decline in suspension in summary the seps and the beps would all affect the fouling process in the real algal separation among all those factors the ratio and types of carbohydrates and proteins in the seps and the beps could influence their fouling behaviors the flux decline in c vulgaris suspension was mostly due to cell deposition whereas that of s obliquus suspension was mainly caused by the seps cake layer formation although the beps could partially help cells to deposit on the membrane surface initially the seps in the solution would cause the main flux reduction at the later stage this study revealed fundamental mechanisms of fo membrane fouling caused by microalgae suspension and facilitated the development of fouling control strategies such as the selections of pretreatment strategy to reduce the beps content and thus the cleaning strategy to reduce proteins upon the membrane surface 4 conclusions this study showed the underlying interaction mechanisms between the seps the beps and the cells the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the beps from c vulgaris and s obliquus both had caused the severest fouling degree on the fo membrane which could be supported by thermodynamic analysis 2 compared with the lower fouling of the seps for c vulgaris the higher proteins contents in the seps of s obliquus would cause higher membrane fouling and the interactions between carbohydrates and proteins would enhance the resistance of the cake layer 3 a synergistic effect of seps and the beps was found in the fouling process of algal rich suspension separation the cells of c vulgaris were deposited on the membrane surface and then formed a dense cell layer with the loose seps cake layer whereas for s obliquus the cells initially formed loose clusters on the fo membrane and then the seps layer formation caused higher flux decline 4 this study sheds light on the fo fouling mechanisms of the seps and the beps from microalgae and it could improve our understanding of the membrane fouling mitigation strategy in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

including those that were previously suggested to be constitutively expressed were repressed denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge of amplified 16s rrna genes indicated that the majority of cells in the community belonged to the dehalococcoides although the cstr was operated under non sterile conditions hence tightly controlled cstr cultivation of dehalococcoides opens novel options to improve biomass production for bioaugmentation and for advanced biochemical studies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organohalide respiration continuous stirred tank reactor brominated phenolic compounds online activity monitoring bioremediation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction bacteria of the genus dehalococcoides are being commercially used to remediate aquifers contaminated with halogenated and highly persistent compounds such as perchloroethene pce steffan and schaefer 2016 various axenic dehalococcoides strains are able to transform halogenated compounds including chlorinated dioxins biphenyls pcbs benzenes anilines and thiophenes zinder 2016 in addition brominated and iodinated compounds such as brominated flame retardants and iodinated x ray contrast media are reductively dehalogenated this reductive dehalogenation is coupled in dehalococcoides strains to energy conservation via a respiratory chain with hydrogen as an electron donor and acetate plus carbonate as the carbon sources no other mode of energy conservation than this organohalide respiration has been detected in any of the isolated dehalococcoides strains on one hand this high physiological specificity is good for in situ application because the occurrence of reductive dehalogenation can be tightly correlated with the presence of dehalococcoides on the other hand the physiological specificity also makes the production of cell mass challenging as a prerequisite cell growth requires the presence of halogenated compounds which often have low water solubility and are often toxic at concentrations in the micromolar range however electron acceptors have to be added in the millimolar range to obtain sufficient cell numbers because of the molar growth yield of about 1013 1014 cells per mol of halogen substituent removed cooper et al 2015 such concentration of halogenated compounds is difficult to achieve in batch cultures and often causes growth inhibition another challenge in the cultivation of dehalococcoides strains is the formation of less halogenated compounds as end products of the dehalogenation reaction that can be more toxic than the parent compound for example many dehalococcoides strains transform pce only to the more toxic intermediate vinyl chloride vc which accumulates in the cultivation broth a third challenge is the high oxygen sensitivity of dehalococcoides strains that requires cultivation in gas tight vessels with oxygen protection by reducing agents a last complication in the cultivation of dehalococcoides strains is the monitoring of activity and cell growth because no detectable turbidity can be observed during bacterial growth due to the small size of the cells and offline monitoring of cell counts or compound concentrations is laborious it is therefore time consuming to determine the optimum harvesting moment when the bacteria reach their late exponential growth phase in a batch culture the genomes of all fully sequenced dehalococcoides strains contain many different reductive dehalogenase operons most of which encode a catalytic subunit rdha and a small 90 amino acid integral membrane protein rdhb which is assumed to be a membrane anchor for rdha in our previous work we have shown that the two proteins rdha rdhb form a distinct module which is part of a larger respiratory membrane bound protein complex containing additionally a central module three different subunits of a complex iron sulfur molybdoenzyme cism rothery et al 2008 and a hydrogen uptake module with a two subunit cytochrome free hydrogenase hupl hups kublik et al 2016 seidel et al 2018 rdha and rdhb have shown to be inducible and it is hypothesized that different rdha rdhb versions can be incorporated into the respiratory complex the inducibility of the rdha rdhb module is supported by the almost invariable presence of the gene for a transcription regulator two component systems or marr type regulators upstream of the promotor of rdh operons and has also been demonstrated by proteomic studies as a response to electron acceptor change franke et al 2020 yang et al 2015 this emphasizes that for successful application of dehalococcoides cultures in bioremediation not only the cell number and growth status are important but also the presence of appropriate rdha rdhb proteins in contrast to batch cultivation the use of cstr as bioreactor for cultivation allows to establish optimal cultivation conditions by tightly controlling physicochemical parameters such as ph redox potential or temperature cultivation in cstr is also able to maintain the cell growth at a specific growth rate i e specific doubling time cultivation of dehalococcoides

richardson et al 2002 fermentable organic compounds such as lactate pyruvate or methanol were used as carbon source and electron donor and therefore led to enrichment of fermentative bacteria or methanogens and in many cases led to low abundance of dehalococcoides species berggren et al 2013 mao et al 2019 mortan et al 2017 by operating a continuous reactor at low hydraulic retention time hrt 3 d and high tce concentration 1 2 mm delgado et al 2014 achieved high cell densities of dehalococcoides 109 cells ml 1 in that study lactate and methanol were fed and geobacter as well as methanogenic archaea were detected with high flow rate in the reactor dominance of dehalococcoides could be achieved concerns were raised on the accumulation of inhibitory volatile compounds e g carbon monoxide in the headspace in continuous reactors during the cultivation of dehalococcoides mortan et al 2017 zhuang et al 2014 but such inhibition was not observed in the study by delgado et al 2014 in our study we attempted to cultivate dehalococcoides without fermentable substrates the reactor medium contained acetate as an organic carbon source and hydrogen was added in the reactor headspace as the electron donor cultivation without fermentable substrates has two advantages 1 it guarantees that dehalococcoides will become the dominant species in the reactor since fermentative bacteria cannot thrive 2 it enables online monitoring of dehalogenation activity through pressure drop caused by h2 consumption a novel electron acceptor d or l 3 5 dibrominated tyrosine that can be reductively debrominated to the non toxic debromination product tyrosine was introduced in this study by setting up continuous cultivation in a cstr we aimed to assess the feasibility of a reliable and on line monitored cultivation of d mccartyi strain cbdb1 with acetate as the carbon source and hydrogen in the headspace as the electron donor growth and dehalogenation were evaluated in regard to process stability and biomass yield the presented reactor system has potential applications not only for the large scale generation of highly active cell biomass of d mccartyi for in situ applications but also for the production of cell biomass for biochemical research 2 material and methods 2 1 synthetic medium used for cultivation a synthetic medium was used for cultivation as influent of the semi continuous stirred tank reactor this medium was ph buffered with 10 mm bicarbonate reduced with 2 mm cysteine and amended with 5 mm acetate as a carbon source it also contained a mixture of the vitamins biotin thiamine cyanocobinamide and dimethylbenzimidazole apart from basic minerals and trace metals as described before adrian et al 1998 schipp et al 2013 the synthetic medium was amended with d or l 3 5 dibromotyrosine abcr chemie karlsruhe germany depending on the type of cultivation performed for cultivation in batch starting concentrations between 0 5 and 4 mm of d 3 5 dibromotyrosine d dbt were used for setting up the cstr the synthetic medium used as influent was amended with 5 mm final concentration of d dbt and later on the reactor started operation using the synthetic medium amended with either 5 mm or 1 mm final concentration of l 3 5 dibromotyrosine l dbt depending on the period of operation the change from d dbt to l dbt was made due to the suitability of both isomers for the cultivation purposes and the much lower cost of l dbt compared to d dbt 2 2 reactor setup the principles of the reactor setup have been described in a previous work for the cultivation of the anammox bacterium candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis ding et al 2018 the reactor was gas tight and contained sealed ports to connect a temperature probe and for adding medium and sampling through septa fig s1 continuous operation of the reactor was enabled with an automated psd 4 syringe pump hamilton bonaduz switzerland equipped with a 5 ml syringe model 1010 5 tll with plunger made of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene and a six port distribution valve hamilton bonaduz switzerland by switching the valve to one of the six ports the syringe pump could perform multiple alternative actions such as adding fresh medium h2 and removing reactor liquid in programmed frequency as calculated based on the targeted hydraulic retention time hrt the syringe pump withdrew a fixed volume of reactor liquid 2 of reactor volume and added the same volume of fresh medium the operation was controlled and monitored via a raspberry pi microprocessor running a self developed python script the raspberry pi was also used to continuously monitor the gas pressure in the reactor headspace from a simple pressure sensor mpx5100dp nxp semiconductors in our study two lab scale continuous stirred tank reactors were used for cultivation the first reactor had a volume of 1 liter and was used during periods i and ii of operation the second reactor had a volume of 80 ml and was used from period iii onwards ph values were regularly monitored offline by withdrawing samples for measurement and adjustment of ph in the reactor liquid was done with 5 m naoh throughout the reactor operation period the ph was maintained at 6 8 0 4 2 3 microbiological techniques samples for cell counting were withdrawn from the reactor with a sterile plastic syringe when necessary samples

previously marco urrea et al 2011 this method has a quantification limit of about 106 cells ml 1 samples for dna extraction were withdrawn from the reactor with a sterile plastic syringe and pelleted

the eluted dna was pcr amplified again primers 341fgc 518r12 and the pcr products were purified and sent for sanger sequencing eurofins genomics europe the sequencing results were used for taxonomic identification by matching against the ncbi nt database using nucleotide blast http www ncbi nlm nih gov blast 2 4 ion chromatography liquid chromatography and shot gun proteomics analyses samples from the reactor were periodically withdrawn for further analyses the bromide ion concentration was quantified via ion chromatography using a dionex 120 ion chromatograph equipped with an ionpac as4a sc 4 mm 250 mm column detection limit 10 µm dibromotyrosine bromotyrosine and tyrosine were analyzed by means of a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system with a lichrospher 100 rp 18 5 µm lichrocart 125 4 column with methanol and 0 1 formic acid as the mobile phase before hplc analysis primary amine groups in samples were derivatized using diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate deemm to do this 200 µl of sample were added into 1 ml of reaction buffer containing 7 3 v v mixture of 50 mm borate buffer ph 9 and methanol then 6 µl of deemm was added and the derivatization was carried out overnight at room temperature in the dark the derivatized tyrosine and brominated tyrosines were detected in the hplc at a wavelength of 280 nm detection limit 5 µm for shot gun proteomics 1 ml of reactor liquid was centrifuged down at 14 000 g 16 c 30 min to obtain the cell pellet cell disruption trypsin digestion and peptide desalting using c18 ziptips millipore merck were done as previously described ding and adrian 2020 desalted peptides were analyzed using nano liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry nlc ms ms with an orbitrap fusion thermo under the analytical conditions described before ding and adrian 2020 mass spectra were evaluated with proteomediscoverer software v2 4 thermo and protein quantities were calculated by using the peak areas of precursor peptides in the ms1 scans using the minora node of proteomediscoverer to calculate relative abundances the abundance of a target protein was divided by the sum of abundances of all detected proteins in a sample 2 5 calculations as shown in eq 1 in a chemostat the dilution rate d is equal to the growth rate µ of the culture and the inverse of the hydraulic retention time hrt therefore the growth rate can be modified by changing the inflow rate f or the liquid volume of the reactor v 1 μ d 1 hrt f v the hydraulic loading rate was calculated as the molar amount of dbt entering the system per units of volume in the reactor per day of operation and the specific loading rate was calculated as the molar amount of dbt entering the system per bacterial cell in the reactor per day of operation these design parameters were calculated as follows 2 hydr aulic load ing rate mmol dbt l day dbt infl uent mmol l f l day v l where dbt influent is the concentration of l dbt in the influent 1 mm or 5 mm depending on the period of operation f is the inflow rate applied in the cstr and v is the liquid volume of the cstr 1 l or 80 ml depending on the period of operation 3 spec ific load ing rate mmol dbt cell day hydr aulic load ing rate mmol dbt l day cells reac tor cells l where cells reactor is the cell density of the culture in the cstr the molar growth yield was calculated considering the steady state operation as follows 4 molar grow th yield cell mol b r cells effl uent cells l dbt infl uent mol dbt l sr mol b r mol dbt where cell effluent is the cell density of the effluent in the cstr which is equal to the cell density of the culture dbt influent is the influent concentration of l dbt 1 mm or 5 mm depending on the period of operation sr is the stoichiometry ratio of the dehalogenation reaction of the dibromotyrosine i e sr is equal to 2 mol bromide released per mol of dibromotyrosine dehalogenated 3 results 3 1 debromination of 3 5 dibromotyrosine by d mccartyi strain cbdb1 in preliminary experiments with batch cultures it was shown that d mccartyi strain cbdb1 can use d dbt as a terminal electron acceptor and can grow on the basis of this reaction through anaerobic respiration with acetate plus carbonate as the carbon source and hydrogen as the electron donor results not shown initial concentrations in the cultures between 0 5 and 4 mm of d dbt were tested in batch cultures and growth was shown by direct cell counting however complete inhibition of cell growth was observed with 4 mm of d dbt the maximum cell density obtained in these batch cultures was 1 0 108 cell ml 1 the products of the d dbt dehalogenation process were tyrosine and bromide and the results matched the theoretical stoichiometry of 1 2 dibromotyrosine bromide 3 2 start up of continuous cultivation of strain cbdb1 in a cstr a pre reactor was set up to produce active culture liquid for the inoculation of the main reactor the pre reactor vessel contained 950 ml cysteine reduced medium with 1 mm d dbt and was inoculated with 50 ml active culture containing 5 0 107 ml 1 d mccartyi strain cbdb1 which was previously growing on 1 mm d dbt in serum bottles at day 0 of the pre reactor operation 6 7 kpa of h2 were added into the headspace as the electron donor and h2 was regularly replenished when the pressure dropped on day 11 of pre reactor operation cell density reached 1 7 107 cells ml 1 and the concentration of bromide ions as determined by ion chromatography reached 1 6 mm then the pre reactor headspace was periodically flushed with h2 and a small share of the pre reactor liquid was periodically replaced with fresh medium containing 5 mm of d dbt with a maximum single dose of 50 ml resulting in a concentration increase of 0 25 mm d dbt in the pre reactor on day 21 of pre reactor operation the cell density reached 1 4 108 cell ml 1 and the bromide concentration reached 6 8 mm then the pre reactor was switched to a daily flow of 43 2 ml equivalent to an hrt of 23 d such reactor flow was maintained for 23 days and 1 l of effluent was captured and stored at 4 5 c after one month storage at 4 5 c the effluent was filtered through wide pore filter paper under strictly anoxic conditions in the anaerobic tent to remove tyrosine crystals the filtrate was transferred into the clean reactor vessel as the starting reactor liquid day 0 of the main reactor with the beginning of the main reactor operation the electron acceptor was switched from 5 mm d dbt to 5 mm l dbt while the hrt remained at 23 d on day 57 16 ml of reactor liquid was mixed anoxically with 64 ml fresh medium containing no dbt as the starting reactor liquid for a downscaled 80 ml reactor the reduction in reactor volume was decided in order to achieve higher daily flows in the reactor without stressing the syringe pump for this 80 ml reactor the concentration of l dbt in the medium used as influent was lowered from 5 mm to 1 mm lowering the dbt concentration at the high flow rate was necessary because hydrogen transfer from headspace might have become limiting if the dbt concentration in the medium was too high on day 60 3 days after the 80 ml reactor was established the continuous feeding of the cstr was restarted 3 3 performance of the cstr with a d mccartyi strain cbdb1 enriched culture the above mentioned lab scale cstr main reactor was operated in continuous mode for 155 days with l dbt as the electron acceptor the operation was divided into six periods i to vi based on different hydraulic conditions applied to the reactor the dilution rate was stepwise increased to achieve fast growth thus the hrt was decreased from 23 days in period i to 4 days in period vi fig 1 successful continuous reactor operation was achieved without accumulation of brominated compounds and the results again accorded to the theoretical molar stoichiometry of 1 2 dibromotyrosine bromide ions decrease of reactor headspace pressure was constantly observed indicating h2 consumption fig 1 shows the l dbt loading rate and the l dbt specific removal activity achieved for each period of operation the specific removal activity was not plotted for period i because the reactor had not reached the pseudo steady state yet still the measured values of l dbt concentration were very low during this period in fact the concentration of l dbt in the reactor was under the detection limit 5 µm during most of the operation time the same was true for the potential dehalogenation intermediate 3 monobromotyrosine accumulation of l dbt was only observed during the start up of the continuous operation period i with 0 03 0 02 1 3 and 0 02 mm of l dbt measured on days 1 8 17 and 28 respectively indicating that the culture had to adapt to the conditions during period i the highest l dbt concentration was detected on day 17 which was due to the restart of the operation after one day of starving conditions fresh medium input was stopped for one day for the rest of the operation we did not again observe a significant increase of l dbt in the reactor indicating that the bacterial growth was continuously limited by the concentration of l dbt from period ii to iv the removal rate was maintained at an average value of 7 10 12 3 10 12 nkat cell 1 it is important to notice that when the hydraulic loading rate decreased from period ii to iii the specific loading rate i e the amount of l dbt loaded per cell was still maintained this is due to the fact that chemostat operations allow for uncoupling of the growth rate and the cell density of the culture and here both parameters changed when moving from period ii to iii higher µ and lower electron acceptor concentration in the influent were applied resulting in an unchanged specific loading rate in periods v and vi the l dbt specific loading rate was increased and no increase of the l dbt concentration was observed in the reactor liquid the average specific removal rate achieved during period v and beginning of period vi was 2 5 10 11 0 5 10 11 nkat cell 1 on day 149 the l dbt loading rate was further increased to 6 1 10 12 mmol dbt cell 1 day 1 and again no accumulation of brominated compounds occurred during periods i and ii the formation of whitish turbidity was observed in the reactor but the operation was not affected under these circumstances when the effluent of the reactor was collected and stored at 4 5 c the formation of needle like crystals occurred while the supernatant was clear fig s2 since the tyrosine concentration in the cstr 5 mm was higher than the tyrosine solubility in water 2 5 mm the precipitates were expected to be tyrosine crystals which was the final product of the debromination process from l dbt the identity of the crystals was confirmed with hplc uv by comparing to the retention time and absorbance spectra of a neat tyrosine standard the continuous cultivation in the cstr allowed for the calculation of h2 consumption based on the decrease of pressure in the reactor headspace periodically the actual gas consumption was calculated from the pressure data and it matched with the theoretical values expected from the molar stoichiometry of 1 2 dibromotyrosine hydrogen fig 2 table 1 hence the extent of the dehalogenation process of l dbt was assessed in real time during the entire operation of the cstr for instance on day 17 when the medium feeding was stopped no decrease in headspace pressure was observed i e no consumption of h2 the cell density obtained in the cstr varied according to the operation conditions fig 3 and the maximum cell density achieved was of 8 5 108 cell ml 1 only limited by the l dbt concentration the decrease of cell density observed from period ii to iii was related to the decrease of l dbt concentration in the influent from 5 mm to 1 mm and the decrease of cell density observed from period iv to v was due to a culture withdrawn intentionally performed during sampling the molar growth yield of the culture growing on l dbt varied during the different periods of cultivation resulting in 9 1013 5 1013 cell mol 1 br the highest molar growth yield was obtained on periods iii and iv with an average value of 1 2 1014 0 3 1014 cell mol 1 br under the same conditions of electron acceptor influent concentration periods iii to vi 1 mm of 3 5 dbt the higher the growth rate imposed i e the younger the culture the lower the molar growth yield observed fig 4 fig 5 shows an image of the sybr green stained cells withdrawn from the cstr and the results of one of the dgge analyses performed on a culture sample on one hand during the entire operation the typical spherical cell shape of d mccartyi strain cbdb1 was observed in samples directly withdrawn from the cstr on the other hand dgge results demonstrated that a high enrichment in d mccartyi strain cbdb1 was maintained when operating the cstr despite the reactor was not operated under sterile conditions 3 4 expression of reductive dehalogenases samples of the cstr culture were periodically withdrawn to evaluate the expression of reductive dehalogenases shotgun proteomics analyses were performed with samples of days 8 21 57 112 and 144 all from culture growing on l dbt a sample from the culture growing on d dbt in the pre reactor see section 2 2 for details was also used for shotgun proteomics for comparison a total of nine different rdha proteins were identified to be expressed although not in all the periods of operation tables 2 s1 the relative abundance of the different rdha also varied among periods cbdba84 cbdba238 and cbdba1092 were identified in all the samples although no correlation with time of operation and relative abundance was observed overall cbdba238 and cbdba1092 showed the highest abundance compared to the other rdha identified in the samples with the exception of sample from period iv when cbdba84 was also highly expressed details on the protein abundances can be found in the supplementary material a cross comparison of rdha abundance among cbdb1 culture fed with different halogenated compounds table 2 showed an association of expressed rdha with the type of halogenated compound added cbdba80 and cbdba84 were highly expressed when halogenated benzenes were provided whereas cbdba1092 was only detected when the halogenated compound contained a phenol ring dbt tetrabromobisphenol a or bromophenol blue the expression of cbdba238 was exclusively associated with culture fed with l or d dbt indicating specific induction by this compound a significant difference between the induction by l and d dbt was not found 4 discussion 4 1 cstr as a strategy for cultivating dehalococcoides the results of this study show how d mccartyi strain cbdb1 can be cultivated in continuous mode in a cstr using l dbt as electron acceptor hydrogen as electron donor and acetate as carbon source the cstr design used here was introduced in a previous work of the authors as a very useful tool to cultivate anammox bacteria ding et al 2018 but it was not tested so far for anaerobic cultivation where a substrate was added from the gaseous phase this is an important issue when cultivating the strictly anaerobic bacteria d mccartyi strain cbdb1 because potential negative headspace pressure could lead to air leakage which would trigger the cessation of the dehalogenation process the gas sealed setup the continuous monitoring of pressure in the headspace and the automated maintenance of a positive pressure in the gas phase allowed for a successful long term stable operation of the cstr demonstrating the feasibility of using the cstr for cultivation under anoxic conditions besides the continuous monitoring of headspace pressure allowed the quantitative evaluation of the dehalogenation process in real time because the rate of pressure decrease quantitatively correlated with the l dbt consumption rate such precise online monitoring is key for controlling the dehalogenation process in continuous mode in cstr in addition the cstr operation provided robustness to face changing loading rates as shown in fig 1 l dbt concentration in the cstr was zero even when the specific loading rate was increased from day 120 onwards the increase in removal rate without any accumulation of l dbt indicated that the culture growth was limited by a lack of the halogenated electron acceptor hence the d mccartyi strain cbdb1 culture was not yet at its maximum dehalogenation capacity in general cultivation in continuous mode can achieve higher dehalogenating rates than in batch mode because the continuous mode maintains the bacteria in their exponential growth phase this is best illustrated by the accumulation of dibromotyrosine on day 17 after starving the reactor for only one day fig 1 showing cells that have been starved for only one day were not able to cope with the loading rate that was applied before the dehalogenation rates obtained in this study are in the same range of those reported by delgado et al 2014 for dichloroethene dehalogenation in a cstr containing a dehalococcoides dechlorinating mixed culture 0 5 1 4 mmol cl l 1 d 1 another important advantage of the cstr design is the possibility to control the cell density of the culture by increasing the substrate concentration in the influent madigan et al 2006 fig 3 shows that the highest cell density in the cstr was obtained when the influent concentration was 5 mm l dbt as expected in a chemostat the higher the electron acceptor concentration in the influent the higher the cell density of the culture in this period the steady state was probably not achieved due to the high hrt applied hrt of 23 and 17 days in periods i and ii respectively and thus the maximum cell density was not achieved higher cell numbers would be expected if there were no limitations in growth by lack of electron acceptor and or if higher influent concentrations than 5 mm were used in this sense the cultivation in a cstr allows the use of higher concentrations of electron acceptor than the ones used in batch systems because of the immediate dilution of influent when entering the reactor overcoming the potential toxicity or inhibition by electron acceptor addition we observed complete inhibition of the growth of d mccartyi strain cbdb1 in batch cultures when using initial concentration of 4 mm d dbt whereas 5 mm inflow concentration generated no problem in the cstr of this study despite the observed electron acceptor limitations the bacterial growth was sustained in the long term in our cstr even when imposing a high inflow rate in the system with a doubling time of 3 days in period vi d mccartyi strain cbdb1 was reported to have a doubling time between 1 and 3 days löffler et al 2013 also the maximum cell density achieved in the cstr cultivation 8 5 108 cell ml 1 was higher than the usually achieved maximum cell number in batch cultures 1 5 108 cells ml 1 in a fully grown culture the feasibility of obtaining high cell density d mccartyi strain cbdb1 cultures in continuous mode makes the cstr configuration a promising choice for establishing bioremediation strategies for contaminated sites where a continuous feeding of high cell number cultures with high activity is needed 4 2 3 5 dibromotyrosine as suitable electron acceptor for d mccartyi strain cbdb1 the cultivation of d mccartyi strain cbdb1 using 3 5 dibromotyrosine was introduced here for the first time and it was demonstrated that strain cbdb1 grows with both isomers d and l of dibromotyrosine as electron acceptors the brominated version of the amino acid tyrosine was selected on the basis of its presumed harmlessness and its decent water solubility 10 mm at room temperature so its use for routine cultivation was considered to be picture perfect the final product of its dehalogenation is non toxic and does not contain any halogen substituent anymore so that the waste disposal is easy to handle in the laboratory altogether this organohalide is presented as promising electron acceptor to be used for cultivation purposes of d mccartyi strain cbdb1 in this study growth of d mccartyi strain cbdb1 was shown when using both 5 mm and 1 mm of l dbt which represent very high concentrations in the haloaromatics dehalogenation field in comparison with other brominated organic compounds concentrations in the micromolar range have often to be used to avoid toxicity and to observe growth wagner et al 2012 yang et al 2015 hence the possibility of using concentrations as high as 5 mm is beneficial in terms of achieving high biomass concentrations for bioremediation purposes the potential limitation of the use of high concentrations of 3 5 dbt as electron acceptor was the formation of precipitates of the final product tyrosine which could trigger mass transfer problems in the reactor this issue is addressed in the section 4 3 below full debromination of 3 5 dbt to the non halogenated product and the associated growth of strain cbdb1 was observed the obtained molar growth yield 9 1013 5 1013 cell mol 1 br was in the range of molar growth yields reported for d mccartyi strain cbdb1 growing with other brominated or chlorinated electron acceptors such as bromobenzenes 1 8 to 2 8 1014 cell mol 1 br wagner et al 2012 bromophenols 3 1014 yang et al 2015 chlorobenzenes 7 1013 to 1 1014 cell mol 1 cl jayachandran et al 2003 or chlorophenols 8 1013 cell mol 1 cl adrian et al 2007a all these reported molar growth yields were determined in batch cultures and thus the molar growth yield was an integrated value over the whole incubation period including all the different growth phases of batch cultivation here we induced different stable growth rates cell doubling times by changing the inflow rate and found that the molar growth yield was lower when the growth rate was increased i e when doubling time decreased fig 4 such decrease in molar growth yields at high growth rate is counterintuitive as less maintenance energy is spent when cells grow faster and should have led to higher molar growth yields multiple reasons could have caused such a phenomenon 1 it could be that with increased inflow rate cells detected higher availability of halogenated compounds and expressed more respiratory proteins table s1 leading to more energy spent on each cell division 2 generally higher protein and dna content and larger cell size in fast growing cells 3 biofilm may have accumulated on the reactor vessel leading to lower cell molar growth yields as calculated based on numbers of planktonic cells in reactor liquid although we did not observe visible biofilm formation however the maintenance energy requirements seemed to play an inferior role further investigation is needed to elucidate the possible causes l and d dbt are not obvious natural substrates widely present in the environment to support growth of dehalococcoides species but can still be respired by strain cbdb1 similar phenomena have been observed with other halogenated compounds that are used by strain cbdb1 for anaerobic respiration e g with bromophenol blue also strain cbdb1 did not encounter any brominated tyrosine since its transfer to continuous lab cultivation in 1995 and there was no difference in the growth between the two dbt isomers this all supports previous conclusion that the reductive dehalogenases must react relatively unspecific towards a range of halogenated aromatics cooper et al 2015 evidence accumulates that the side groups but not the halogen substituents determine the specificity of reductive dehalogenases in dehalococcoides the stoichiometric conversion of hydrogen and dbt to tyrosine and the absence of any other electron acceptors or fermentable substrates demonstrated that strain cbdb1 was using dbt as a respiratory electron acceptor the specific expression of rdha proteins in cells withdrawn from the cstr indicated their involvement in this process d mccartyi strain cbdb1 contains 32 different reductive dehalogenase operons on the genome each constituted by one rdha and one rdhb gene plus regulatory genes which encode the catalytic enzyme rdha and its putative membrane anchor rdhb however so far no clear correlation was established between the transcription of these rdha genes and the exposure to particular organohalides and it was suggested that a low and steady transcription of most of them occurs maillard and willemin 2019 our results contribute to this idea since up to 9 different rdha proteins were identified but only two proteins were present with high abundances in all the samples collected from the reactor this fact suggests that those two proteins actually catalyzed the debromination of dibromotyrosine on one hand we observed the specific induction of the rdha protein cbdba238 which was not identified with previous halogenated electron acceptors suggesting specificity for reduction of dibromotyrosine on the other hand the high expression of cbdba1092 supports the hypothesis that this protein could be involved in the dehalogenation of brominated oligocyclic phenolic compounds as previously suggested by yang et al 2015 when cultivating strain cbdb1 with bromophenol blue as electron acceptor in fact unpublished results from our lab showed that cbdba1092 was the only rdha identified in batch cultures when cultivating strain cbdb1 on bromophenol blue after five passages to fresh medium table 2 the rdha cbdba84 often identified in cultures of strain cbdb1 was identified in this study in all the samples although with significant abundance only at the end of the operation this rdha was initially associated with the dehalogenation of chlorinated benzenes adrian et al 2007b and it was also identified in the presence of brominated benzenes wagner et al 2012 it is worth to notice the disappearance of the reductive dehalogenase cbdba80 commonly found in protein samples of strain cbdb1 cultures which could indicate that this rdha is not broadly expressed as it was thought and more specifically cbdba80 is not specific for dehalogenation of dibromotyrosine 4 3 practical implications for the design of bioremediation strategies the stable and easily maintainable operation the resilience to face high loading rates the possibility of controlling cell density and maintaining the exponential phase of growth and the capacity of overcoming electron acceptor toxicity issues make the cstr design a promising tool for producing cells of d mccartyi strain cbdb1 for downstream applications the cstr allows the control of the growth rate and the cell number independently for producing biomass at a maximum and stable cell density for full scale applications of bioremediation it will be of paramount importance to determine i the optimum growth rate of the culture under the reactor conditions and ii the optimum influent concentration of the electron acceptor that can be handled in addition the success on growing an active culture using 3 5 dibromotyrosine that produces non toxic tyrosine makes the tandem cstr dbt the perfect choice to produce high biomass concentrations of d mccartyi strain cbdb1 for downstream processes either bioremediation processes or research experiments the only potential drawback of using 3 5 dibromotyrosine as electron acceptor is the relatively low water solubility of the end product of the dehalogenation tyrosine since at concentrations higher than 2 mm it can already trigger the formation of precipitates in the reactor this precipitate formation could be a suitable surface for biofilm formation and aggregations of bacteria could lead to mass transfer limitations which limit the d mccartyi strain cbdb1 growth however in this study such limitations were not observed despite of the formation of precipitates during periods i and ii on the contrary the precipitation of tyrosine allowed for an easy separation of it and thus its removal from the effluent by filtration hence the precipitation of tyrosine could also be seen as beneficial to obtain a clean effluent also tyrosine is a natural compound that although it is not incorporated into the metabolism from external sources by strain cbdb1 marco urrea et al 2012 it can be used by many bacteria as carbon or nitrogen source and thus it should not represent a contaminant for in situ applications so that the effluent of the reactor does not need any additional cleaning step before application for bioaugmentation due to the substrate specificity of reductive dehalogenases sometimes it is inevitable to use organohalides that are toxic or organohalides that produce toxic dehalogenated products in such cases continuous cultivation of dehalococcoides is still feasible with our reactor design as long as necessary precautions are taken the pressure monitoring could even be applied when volatile organohalides or products are involved e g dechlorination from tce to ethene in such cases an adjustment to the h2 consumption rate has to be made to compensate for partial pressure increase that is caused by the production of the volatile compound e g ethene in summary the reactor setup presented in this study is broadly applicable to other dehalococcoides or dehalogenimonas strains with organohalides other than brominated tyrosines 5 conclusions d mccartyi strain cbdb1 was successfully cultivated in continuous mode in a semi continuous stirred tank reactor and long term stable operation was achieved acetate instead of fermentable organics was used as the carbon source the simple and easy handled design the feasibility of monitoring the dehalogenation process in real time the reactor resilience to confront high organohalide loading rates and the possibility of obtaining high cell density cultures make the cstr a promising tool for stable cultivation growth on the compound 3 5 dibromotyrosine which produces non toxic tyrosine was demonstrated and molar cell yields obtained were in the same range of those previously shown for d mccartyi strain cbdb1 the specific reductive dehalogenases cbdba238 and cbdba1092 were expressed when using dibromotyrosine as electron acceptor the tandem cstr dibromotyrosine is a good choice for producing high volume of d mccartyi strain cbdb1 cultures at high biomass concentration which can be used in downstream

helmholtz centre for environmental research ufz department of environmental biotechnology permoserstraße 15 leipzig 04318 germany dehalococcoides mccartyi strain cbdb1 is a strictly anaerobic organohalide respiring bacterium with strong application potential to remediate aquifers and soils contaminated with halogenated aromatics to date cultivation of strain cbdb1 has mostly been done in bottles or fed batch reactors challenges with such systems include low biomass yield and difficulties in controlling the growth conditions here we report the cultivation of planktonic d mccartyi strain cbdb1 in a continuous stirring tank reactor cstr that led to high cell densities 8 108 cells ml 1 and dominance of strain cbdb1 the reactor culture received acetate hydrogen and the brominated amino acid d or l 3 5 dibromotyrosine as substrates both d and l 3 5 dibromotyrosine were utilized as respiratory electron acceptors and are promising for biomass production due to their decent solubility in water and the formation of a non toxic debromination product tyrosine by monitoring headspace pressure decrease which is indicative of hydrogen consumption the organohalide respiration rate was followed in real time proteomics analyses revealed that the reductive dehalogenase cbdba238 was highly expressed with both d and l 3 5 dibromotyrosine while other reductive dehalogenases including those that were previously suggested to be constitutively expressed were repressed denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge of amplified 16s rrna genes indicated that the majority of cells in the community belonged to the dehalococcoides although the cstr was operated under non sterile conditions hence tightly controlled cstr cultivation of dehalococcoides opens novel options to improve biomass production for bioaugmentation and for advanced biochemical studies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organohalide respiration continuous stirred tank reactor brominated phenolic compounds online activity monitoring bioremediation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction bacteria of the genus dehalococcoides are being commercially used to remediate aquifers contaminated with halogenated and highly persistent compounds such as perchloroethene pce steffan and schaefer 2016 various axenic dehalococcoides strains are able to transform halogenated compounds including chlorinated dioxins biphenyls pcbs benzenes anilines and thiophenes zinder 2016 in addition brominated and iodinated compounds such as brominated flame retardants and iodinated x ray contrast media are reductively dehalogenated this reductive dehalogenation is coupled in dehalococcoides strains to energy conservation via a respiratory chain with hydrogen as an electron donor and acetate plus carbonate as the carbon sources no other mode of energy conservation than this organohalide respiration has been detected in any of the isolated dehalococcoides strains on one hand this high physiological specificity is good for in situ application because the occurrence of reductive dehalogenation can be tightly correlated with the presence of dehalococcoides on the other hand the physiological specificity also makes the production of cell mass challenging as a prerequisite cell growth requires the presence of halogenated compounds which often have low water solubility and are often toxic at concentrations in the micromolar range however electron acceptors have to be added in the millimolar range to obtain sufficient cell numbers because of the molar growth yield of about 1013 1014 cells per mol of halogen substituent removed cooper et al 2015 such concentration of halogenated compounds is difficult to achieve in batch cultures and often causes growth inhibition another challenge in the cultivation of dehalococcoides strains is the formation of less halogenated compounds as end products of the dehalogenation reaction that can be more toxic than the parent compound for example many dehalococcoides strains transform pce only to the more toxic intermediate vinyl chloride vc which accumulates in the cultivation broth a third challenge is the high oxygen sensitivity of dehalococcoides strains that requires cultivation in gas tight vessels with oxygen protection by reducing agents a last complication in the cultivation of dehalococcoides strains is the monitoring of activity and cell growth because no detectable turbidity can be observed during bacterial growth due to the small size of the cells and offline monitoring of cell counts or compound concentrations is laborious it is therefore time consuming to determine the optimum harvesting moment when the bacteria reach their late exponential growth phase in a batch culture the genomes of all fully sequenced dehalococcoides strains contain many different reductive dehalogenase operons most of which encode a catalytic subunit rdha and a small 90 amino acid integral membrane protein rdhb which is assumed to be a membrane anchor for rdha in our previous work we have shown that the two proteins rdha rdhb form a distinct module which is part of a larger respiratory membrane bound protein complex containing additionally a central module three different subunits of a complex iron sulfur molybdoenzyme cism rothery et al 2008 and a hydrogen uptake module with a two subunit cytochrome free hydrogenase hupl hups kublik et al 2016 seidel et al 2018 rdha and rdhb have shown to be inducible and it is hypothesized that different rdha rdhb versions can be incorporated into the respiratory complex the inducibility of the rdha rdhb module is supported by the almost invariable presence of the gene for a transcription regulator two component systems or marr type regulators upstream of the promotor of rdh operons and has also been demonstrated by proteomic studies as a response to electron acceptor change franke et al 2020 yang et al 2015 this emphasizes that for successful application of dehalococcoides cultures in bioremediation not only the cell number and growth status are important but also the presence of appropriate rdha rdhb proteins in contrast to batch cultivation the use of cstr as bioreactor for cultivation allows to establish optimal cultivation conditions by tightly controlling physicochemical parameters such as ph redox potential or temperature cultivation in cstr is also able to maintain the cell growth at a specific growth rate i e specific doubling time cultivation of dehalococcoides species in continuous or fed batch reactors have been reported with pce trichloroethene tce or vc as electron acceptors mao et al 2019 mortan et al 2017 berggren et al 2013 delgado et al 2014 richardson et al 2002 fermentable organic compounds such as lactate pyruvate or methanol were used as carbon source and electron donor and therefore led to enrichment of fermentative bacteria or methanogens and in many cases led to low abundance of dehalococcoides species berggren et al 2013 mao et al 2019 mortan et al 2017 by operating a continuous reactor at low hydraulic retention time hrt 3 d and high tce concentration 1 2 mm delgado et al 2014 achieved high cell densities of dehalococcoides 109 cells ml 1 in that study lactate and methanol were fed and geobacter as well as methanogenic archaea were detected with high flow rate in the reactor dominance of dehalococcoides could be achieved concerns were raised on the accumulation of inhibitory volatile compounds e g carbon monoxide in the headspace in continuous reactors during the cultivation of dehalococcoides mortan et al 2017 zhuang et al 2014 but such inhibition was not observed in the study by delgado et al 2014 in our study we attempted to cultivate dehalococcoides without fermentable substrates the reactor medium contained acetate as an organic carbon source and hydrogen was added in the reactor headspace as the electron donor cultivation without fermentable substrates has two advantages 1 it guarantees that dehalococcoides will become the dominant species in the reactor since fermentative bacteria cannot thrive 2 it enables online monitoring of dehalogenation activity through pressure drop caused by h2 consumption a novel electron acceptor d or l 3 5 dibrominated tyrosine that can be reductively debrominated to the non toxic debromination product tyrosine was introduced in this study by setting up continuous cultivation in a cstr we aimed to assess the feasibility of a reliable and on line monitored cultivation of d mccartyi strain cbdb1 with acetate as the carbon source and hydrogen in the headspace as the electron donor growth and dehalogenation were evaluated in regard to process stability and biomass yield the presented reactor system has potential applications not only for the large scale generation of highly active cell biomass of d mccartyi for in situ applications but also for the production of cell biomass for biochemical research 2 material and methods 2 1 synthetic medium used for cultivation a synthetic medium was used for cultivation as influent of the semi continuous stirred tank reactor this medium was ph buffered with 10 mm bicarbonate reduced with 2 mm cysteine and amended with 5 mm acetate as a carbon source it also contained a mixture of the vitamins biotin thiamine cyanocobinamide and dimethylbenzimidazole apart from basic minerals and trace metals as described before adrian et al 1998 schipp et al 2013 the synthetic medium was amended with d or l 3 5 dibromotyrosine abcr chemie karlsruhe germany depending on the type of cultivation performed for cultivation in batch starting concentrations between 0 5 and 4 mm of d 3 5 dibromotyrosine d dbt were used for setting up the cstr the synthetic medium used as influent was amended with 5 mm final concentration of d dbt and later on the reactor started operation using the synthetic medium amended with either 5 mm or 1 mm final concentration of l 3 5 dibromotyrosine l dbt depending on the period of operation the change from d dbt to l dbt was made due to the suitability of both isomers for the cultivation purposes and the much lower cost of l dbt compared to d dbt 2 2 reactor setup the principles of the reactor setup have been described in a previous work for the cultivation of the anammox bacterium candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis ding et al 2018 the reactor was gas tight and contained sealed ports to connect a temperature probe and for adding medium and sampling through septa fig s1 continuous operation of the reactor was enabled with an automated psd 4 syringe pump hamilton bonaduz switzerland equipped with a 5 ml syringe model 1010 5 tll with plunger made of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene and a six port distribution valve hamilton bonaduz switzerland by switching the valve to one of the six ports the syringe pump could perform multiple alternative actions such as adding fresh medium h2 and removing reactor liquid in programmed frequency as calculated based on the targeted hydraulic retention time hrt the syringe pump withdrew a fixed volume of reactor liquid 2 of reactor volume and added the same volume of fresh medium the operation was controlled and monitored via a raspberry pi microprocessor running a self developed python script the raspberry pi was also used to continuously monitor the gas pressure in the reactor headspace from a simple pressure sensor mpx5100dp nxp semiconductors in our study two lab scale continuous stirred tank reactors were used for cultivation the first reactor had a volume of 1 liter and was used during periods i and ii of operation the second reactor had a volume of 80 ml and was used from period iii onwards ph values were regularly monitored offline by withdrawing samples for measurement and adjustment of ph in the reactor liquid was done with 5 m naoh throughout the reactor operation period the ph was maintained at 6 8 0 4 2 3 microbiological techniques samples for cell counting were withdrawn from the reactor with a sterile plastic syringe when necessary samples were diluted in milliq water before staining cells were quantified by direct cell counting on agarose coated slides with an epifluorescence microscope after staining with sybr green as described previously marco urrea et al 2011 this method has a quantification limit of about 106 cells ml 1 samples for dna extraction were withdrawn from the reactor with a sterile plastic syringe and pelleted by centrifugation twice at 14 000 g 16 c 30 min the resulting pellet was used for extraction of genomic dna by using the nucleospin tissue kit macherey nagel according to the manufacturer s

system bio rad gels were prepared at 10 polyacrylamide and a gradient of 20 80 denaturing agents where 100 corresponds to 7 m urea and 32 v v formamide amplified pcr products of 12 μl were loaded onto the gel and electrophoresis was run in 1 tae buffer at 100 v and 60 c for 16 h the gel was sybr gold stained the bands were cut and dna was eluted by overnight incubation in 10 mm tris hcl at ph 8 5 the eluted dna was pcr amplified again primers 341fgc 518r12 and the pcr products were purified and sent for sanger sequencing eurofins genomics europe the sequencing results were used for taxonomic identification by matching against the ncbi nt database using nucleotide blast http www ncbi nlm nih gov blast 2 4 ion chromatography liquid chromatography and shot gun proteomics analyses samples from the reactor were periodically withdrawn for further analyses the bromide ion concentration was quantified via ion chromatography using a dionex 120 ion chromatograph equipped with an ionpac as4a sc 4 mm 250 mm column detection limit 10 µm dibromotyrosine bromotyrosine and tyrosine were analyzed by means of a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system with a lichrospher 100 rp 18 5 µm lichrocart 125 4 column with methanol and 0 1 formic acid as the mobile phase before hplc analysis primary amine groups in samples were derivatized using diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate deemm to do this 200 µl of sample were added into 1 ml of reaction buffer containing 7 3 v v mixture of 50 mm borate buffer ph 9 and methanol then 6 µl of deemm was added and the derivatization was carried out overnight at room temperature in the dark the derivatized tyrosine and brominated tyrosines were detected in the hplc at a wavelength of 280 nm detection limit 5 µm for shot gun proteomics 1 ml of reactor liquid was centrifuged down at 14 000 g 16 c 30 min to obtain the cell pellet cell disruption trypsin digestion and peptide desalting using c18 ziptips millipore merck were done as previously described ding and adrian 2020 desalted peptides were analyzed using nano liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry nlc ms ms with an orbitrap fusion thermo under the analytical conditions described before ding and adrian 2020 mass spectra were evaluated with proteomediscoverer software v2 4 thermo and protein quantities were calculated by using the peak areas of precursor peptides in the ms1 scans using the minora node of proteomediscoverer to calculate relative abundances the abundance of a target protein was divided by the sum of abundances of all detected proteins in a sample 2 5 calculations as shown in eq 1 in a chemostat the dilution rate d is equal to the growth rate µ of the culture and the inverse of the hydraulic retention time hrt therefore the growth rate can be modified by changing the inflow rate f or the liquid volume of the reactor v 1 μ d 1 hrt f v the hydraulic loading rate was calculated as the molar amount of dbt entering the system per units of volume in the reactor per day of operation and the specific loading rate was calculated as the molar amount of dbt entering the system per bacterial cell in the reactor per day of operation these design parameters were calculated as follows 2 hydr aulic load ing rate mmol dbt l day dbt infl uent mmol l f l day v l where dbt influent is the concentration of l dbt in the influent 1 mm or 5 mm depending on the period of operation f is the inflow rate applied in the cstr and v is the liquid volume of the cstr 1 l or 80 ml depending on the period of operation 3 spec ific load ing rate mmol dbt cell day hydr aulic load ing rate mmol dbt l day cells reac tor cells l where cells reactor is the cell density of the culture in the cstr the molar growth yield was calculated considering the steady state operation as follows 4 molar grow th yield cell mol b r cells effl uent cells l dbt infl uent mol dbt l sr mol b r mol dbt where cell effluent is the cell density of the effluent in the cstr which is equal to the cell density of the culture dbt influent is the influent concentration of l dbt 1 mm or 5 mm depending on the period of operation sr is the stoichiometry ratio of the dehalogenation reaction of the dibromotyrosine i e sr is equal to 2 mol bromide released per mol of dibromotyrosine dehalogenated 3 results 3 1 debromination of 3 5 dibromotyrosine by d mccartyi strain cbdb1 in preliminary experiments with batch cultures it was shown that d mccartyi strain cbdb1 can use d dbt as a terminal electron acceptor and can grow on the basis of this reaction through anaerobic respiration with acetate plus carbonate as the carbon source and hydrogen as the electron donor results not shown initial concentrations in the cultures between 0 5 and 4 mm of d dbt were tested in batch cultures and growth was shown by direct cell counting however complete inhibition of cell growth was observed with 4 mm of d dbt the maximum cell density obtained in these batch cultures was 1 0 108 cell ml 1 the products of the d dbt dehalogenation process were tyrosine and bromide and the results matched the theoretical stoichiometry of 1 2 dibromotyrosine bromide 3 2 start up of continuous cultivation of strain cbdb1 in a cstr a pre reactor was set up to produce active culture liquid for the inoculation of the main reactor the pre reactor vessel contained 950 ml cysteine reduced medium with 1 mm d dbt and was inoculated with 50 ml active culture containing 5 0 107 ml 1 d mccartyi strain cbdb1 which was previously growing on 1 mm d dbt in serum bottles at day 0 of the pre reactor operation 6 7 kpa of h2 were added into the headspace as the electron donor and h2 was regularly replenished when the pressure dropped on day 11 of pre reactor operation cell density reached 1 7 107 cells ml 1 and the concentration of bromide ions as determined by ion chromatography reached 1 6 mm then the pre reactor headspace was periodically flushed with h2 and a small share of the pre reactor liquid was periodically replaced with fresh medium containing 5 mm of d dbt with a maximum single dose of 50 ml resulting in a concentration increase of 0 25 mm d dbt in the pre reactor on day 21 of pre reactor operation the cell density reached 1 4 108 cell ml 1 and the bromide concentration reached 6 8 mm then the pre reactor was switched to a daily flow of 43 2 ml equivalent to an hrt of 23 d such reactor flow was maintained for 23 days and 1 l of effluent was captured and stored at 4 5 c after one month storage at 4 5 c the effluent was filtered through wide pore filter paper under strictly anoxic conditions in the anaerobic tent to remove tyrosine crystals the filtrate was transferred into the clean reactor vessel as the starting reactor liquid day 0 of the main reactor with the beginning of the main reactor operation the electron acceptor was switched from 5 mm d dbt to 5 mm l dbt while the hrt remained at 23 d on day 57 16 ml of reactor liquid was mixed anoxically with 64 ml fresh medium containing no dbt as the starting reactor liquid for a downscaled 80 ml reactor the reduction in reactor volume was decided in order to achieve higher daily flows in the reactor without stressing the syringe pump for this 80 ml reactor the concentration of l dbt in the medium used as influent was lowered from 5 mm to 1 mm lowering the dbt concentration at the high flow rate was necessary because hydrogen transfer from headspace might have become limiting if the dbt concentration in the medium was too high on day 60 3 days after the 80 ml reactor was established the continuous feeding of the cstr was restarted 3 3 performance of the cstr with a d mccartyi strain cbdb1 enriched culture the above mentioned lab scale cstr main reactor was operated in continuous mode for 155 days with l dbt as the electron acceptor the operation was divided into six periods i to vi based on different hydraulic conditions applied to the reactor the dilution rate was stepwise increased to achieve fast growth thus the hrt was decreased from 23 days in period i to 4 days in period vi fig 1 successful continuous reactor operation was achieved without accumulation of brominated compounds and the results again accorded to the theoretical molar stoichiometry of 1 2 dibromotyrosine bromide ions decrease of reactor headspace pressure was constantly observed indicating h2 consumption fig 1 shows the l dbt loading rate and the l dbt specific removal activity achieved for each period of operation the specific removal activity was not plotted for period i because the reactor had not reached the pseudo steady state yet still the measured values of l dbt concentration were very low during this period in fact the concentration of l dbt in the reactor was under the detection limit 5 µm during most of the operation time the same was true for the potential dehalogenation intermediate 3 monobromotyrosine accumulation of l dbt was only observed during the start up of the continuous operation period i with 0 03 0 02 1 3 and 0 02 mm of l dbt measured on days 1 8 17 and 28 respectively indicating that the culture had to adapt to the conditions during period i the highest l dbt concentration was detected on day 17 which was due to the restart of the operation after one day of starving conditions fresh medium input was stopped for one day for the rest of the operation we did not again observe a significant increase of l dbt in the reactor indicating that the bacterial growth was continuously limited by the concentration of l dbt from period ii to iv the removal rate was maintained at an average value of 7 10 12 3 10 12 nkat cell 1 it is important to notice that when the hydraulic loading rate decreased from period ii to iii the specific loading rate i e the amount of l dbt loaded per cell was still maintained this is due to the fact that chemostat operations allow for uncoupling of the growth rate and the cell density of the culture and here both parameters changed when moving from period ii to iii higher µ and lower electron acceptor concentration in the influent were applied resulting in an unchanged specific loading rate in periods v and vi the l dbt specific loading rate was increased and no increase of the l dbt concentration was observed in the reactor liquid the average specific removal rate achieved during period v and beginning of period vi was 2 5 10 11 0 5 10 11 nkat cell 1 on day 149 the l dbt loading rate was further increased to 6 1 10 12 mmol dbt cell 1 day 1 and again no accumulation of brominated compounds occurred during periods i and ii the formation of whitish turbidity was observed in the reactor but the operation was not affected under these circumstances when the effluent of the reactor was collected and stored at 4 5 c the formation of needle like crystals occurred while the supernatant was clear fig s2 since the tyrosine concentration in the cstr 5 mm was higher than the tyrosine solubility in water 2 5 mm the precipitates were expected to be tyrosine crystals which was the final product of the debromination process from l dbt the identity of the crystals was confirmed with hplc uv by comparing to the retention time and absorbance spectra of a neat tyrosine standard the continuous cultivation in the cstr allowed for the calculation of h2 consumption based on the decrease of pressure in the reactor headspace periodically the actual gas consumption was calculated from the pressure data and it matched with the theoretical values expected from the molar stoichiometry of 1 2 dibromotyrosine hydrogen fig 2 table 1 hence the extent of the dehalogenation process of l dbt was assessed in real time during the entire operation of the cstr for instance on day 17 when the medium feeding was stopped no decrease in headspace pressure was observed i e no consumption of h2 the cell density obtained in the cstr varied according to the operation conditions fig 3 and the maximum cell density achieved was of 8 5 108 cell ml 1 only limited by the l dbt concentration the decrease of cell density observed from period ii to iii was related to the decrease of l dbt concentration in the influent from 5 mm to 1 mm and the decrease of cell density observed from period iv to v was due to a culture withdrawn intentionally performed during sampling the molar growth yield of the culture growing on l dbt varied during the different periods of cultivation resulting in 9 1013 5 1013 cell mol 1 br the highest molar growth yield was obtained on periods iii and iv with an average value of 1 2 1014 0 3 1014 cell mol 1 br under the same conditions of electron acceptor influent concentration periods iii to vi 1 mm of 3 5 dbt the higher the growth rate imposed i e the younger the culture the lower the molar growth yield observed fig 4 fig 5 shows an image of the sybr green stained cells withdrawn from the cstr and the results of one of the dgge analyses performed on a culture sample on one hand during the entire operation the typical spherical cell shape of d mccartyi strain cbdb1 was observed in samples directly withdrawn from the cstr on the other hand dgge results demonstrated that a high enrichment in d mccartyi strain cbdb1 was maintained when operating the cstr despite the reactor was not operated under sterile conditions 3 4 expression of reductive dehalogenases samples of the cstr culture were periodically withdrawn to evaluate the expression of reductive dehalogenases shotgun proteomics analyses were performed with samples of days 8 21 57 112 and 144 all from culture growing on l dbt a sample from the culture growing on d dbt in the pre reactor see section 2 2 for details was also used for shotgun proteomics for comparison a total of nine different rdha proteins were identified to be expressed although not in all the periods of operation tables 2 s1 the relative abundance of the different rdha also varied among periods cbdba84 cbdba238 and cbdba1092 were identified in all the samples although no correlation with time of operation and relative abundance was observed overall cbdba238 and cbdba1092 showed the highest abundance compared to the other rdha identified in the samples with the exception of sample from period iv when cbdba84 was also highly expressed details on the protein abundances can be found in the supplementary material a cross comparison of rdha abundance among cbdb1 culture fed with different halogenated compounds table 2 showed an association of expressed rdha with the type of halogenated compound added cbdba80 and cbdba84 were highly expressed when halogenated benzenes were provided whereas cbdba1092 was only detected when the halogenated compound contained a phenol ring dbt tetrabromobisphenol a or bromophenol blue the expression of cbdba238 was exclusively associated with culture fed with l or d dbt indicating specific induction by this compound a significant difference between the induction by l and d dbt was not found 4 discussion 4 1 cstr as a strategy for cultivating dehalococcoides the results of this study show how d mccartyi strain cbdb1 can be cultivated in continuous mode in a cstr using l dbt as electron acceptor hydrogen as electron donor and acetate as carbon source the cstr design used here was introduced in a previous work of the authors as a very useful tool to cultivate anammox bacteria ding et al 2018 but it was not tested so far for anaerobic cultivation where a substrate was added from the gaseous phase this is an important issue when cultivating the strictly anaerobic bacteria d mccartyi strain cbdb1 because potential negative headspace pressure could lead to air leakage which would trigger the cessation of the dehalogenation process the gas sealed setup the continuous monitoring of pressure in the headspace and the automated maintenance of a positive pressure in the gas phase allowed for a successful long term stable operation of the cstr demonstrating the feasibility of using the cstr for cultivation under anoxic conditions besides the continuous monitoring of headspace pressure allowed the quantitative evaluation of the dehalogenation process in real time because the rate of pressure decrease quantitatively correlated with the l dbt consumption rate such precise online monitoring is key for controlling the dehalogenation process in continuous mode in cstr in addition the cstr operation provided robustness to face changing loading rates as shown in fig 1 l dbt concentration in the cstr was zero even when the specific loading rate was increased from day 120 onwards the increase in removal rate without any accumulation of l dbt indicated that the culture growth was limited by a lack of the halogenated electron acceptor hence the d mccartyi strain cbdb1 culture was not yet at its maximum dehalogenation capacity in general cultivation in continuous mode can achieve higher dehalogenating rates than in batch mode because the continuous mode maintains the bacteria in their exponential growth phase this is best illustrated by the accumulation of dibromotyrosine on day 17 after starving the reactor for only one day fig 1 showing cells that have been starved for only one day were not able to cope with the loading rate that was applied before the dehalogenation rates obtained in this study are in the same range of those reported by delgado et al 2014 for dichloroethene dehalogenation in a cstr containing a dehalococcoides dechlorinating mixed culture 0 5 1 4 mmol cl l 1 d 1 another important advantage of the cstr design is the possibility to control the cell density of the culture by increasing the substrate concentration in the influent madigan et al 2006 fig 3 shows that the highest cell density in the cstr was obtained when the influent concentration was 5 mm l dbt as expected in a chemostat the higher the electron acceptor concentration in the influent the higher the cell density of the culture in this period the steady state was probably not achieved due to the high hrt applied hrt of 23 and 17 days in periods i and ii respectively and thus the maximum cell density was not achieved higher cell numbers would be expected if there were no limitations in growth by lack of electron acceptor and or if higher influent concentrations than 5 mm were used in this sense the cultivation in a cstr allows the use of higher concentrations of electron acceptor than the ones used in batch systems because of the immediate dilution of influent when entering the reactor overcoming the potential toxicity or inhibition by electron acceptor addition we observed complete inhibition of the growth of d mccartyi strain cbdb1 in batch cultures when using initial concentration of 4 mm d dbt whereas 5 mm inflow concentration generated no problem in the cstr of this study despite the observed electron acceptor limitations the bacterial growth was sustained in the long term in our cstr even when imposing a high inflow rate in the system with a doubling time of 3 days in period vi d mccartyi strain cbdb1 was reported to have a doubling time between 1 and 3 days löffler et al 2013 also the maximum cell density achieved in the cstr cultivation 8 5 108 cell ml 1 was higher than the usually achieved maximum cell number in batch cultures 1 5 108 cells ml 1 in a fully grown culture the feasibility of obtaining high cell density d mccartyi strain cbdb1 cultures in continuous mode makes the cstr configuration a promising choice for establishing bioremediation strategies for contaminated sites where a continuous feeding of high cell number cultures with high activity is needed 4 2 3 5 dibromotyrosine as suitable electron acceptor for d mccartyi strain cbdb1 the cultivation of d mccartyi strain cbdb1 using 3 5 dibromotyrosine was introduced here for the first time and it was demonstrated that strain cbdb1 grows with both isomers d and l of dibromotyrosine as electron acceptors the brominated version of the amino acid tyrosine was selected on the basis of its presumed harmlessness and its decent water solubility 10 mm at room temperature so its use for routine cultivation was considered to be picture perfect the final product of its dehalogenation is non toxic and does not contain any halogen substituent anymore so that the waste disposal is easy to handle in the laboratory altogether this organohalide is presented as promising electron acceptor to be used for cultivation purposes of d mccartyi strain cbdb1 in this study growth of d mccartyi strain cbdb1 was shown when using both 5 mm and 1 mm of l dbt which represent very high concentrations in the haloaromatics dehalogenation field in comparison with other brominated organic compounds concentrations in the micromolar range have often to be used to avoid toxicity and to observe growth wagner et al 2012 yang et al 2015 hence the possibility of using concentrations as high as 5 mm is beneficial in terms of achieving high biomass concentrations for bioremediation purposes the potential limitation of the use of high concentrations of 3 5 dbt as electron acceptor was the formation of precipitates of the final product tyrosine which could trigger mass transfer problems in the reactor this issue is addressed in the section 4 3 below full debromination of 3 5 dbt to the non halogenated product and the associated growth of strain cbdb1 was observed the obtained molar growth yield 9 1013 5 1013 cell mol 1 br was in the range of molar growth yields reported for d mccartyi strain cbdb1 growing with other brominated or chlorinated electron acceptors such as bromobenzenes 1 8 to 2 8 1014 cell mol 1 br wagner et al 2012 bromophenols 3 1014 yang et al 2015 chlorobenzenes 7 1013 to 1 1014 cell mol 1 cl jayachandran et al 2003 or chlorophenols 8 1013 cell mol 1 cl adrian et al 2007a all these reported molar growth yields were determined in batch cultures and thus the molar growth yield was an integrated value over the whole incubation period including all the different growth phases of batch cultivation here we induced different stable growth rates cell doubling times by changing the inflow rate and found that the molar growth yield was lower when the growth rate was increased i e when doubling time decreased fig 4 such decrease in molar growth yields at high growth rate is counterintuitive as less maintenance energy is spent when cells grow faster and should have led to higher molar growth yields multiple reasons could have caused such a phenomenon 1 it could be that with increased inflow rate cells detected higher availability of halogenated compounds and expressed more respiratory proteins table s1 leading to more energy spent on each cell division 2 generally higher protein and dna content and larger cell size in fast growing cells 3 biofilm may have accumulated on the reactor vessel leading to lower cell molar growth yields as calculated based on numbers of planktonic cells in reactor liquid although we did not observe visible biofilm formation however the maintenance energy requirements seemed to play an inferior role further investigation is needed to elucidate the possible causes l and d dbt are not obvious natural substrates widely present in the environment to support growth of dehalococcoides species but can still be respired by strain cbdb1 similar phenomena have been observed with other halogenated compounds that are used by strain cbdb1 for anaerobic respiration e g with bromophenol blue also strain cbdb1 did not encounter any brominated tyrosine since its transfer to continuous lab cultivation in 1995 and there was no difference in the growth between the two dbt isomers this all supports previous conclusion that the reductive dehalogenases must react relatively unspecific towards a range of halogenated aromatics cooper et al 2015 evidence accumulates that the side groups but not the halogen substituents determine the specificity of reductive dehalogenases in dehalococcoides the stoichiometric conversion of hydrogen and dbt to tyrosine and the absence of any other electron acceptors or fermentable substrates demonstrated that strain cbdb1 was using dbt as a respiratory electron acceptor the specific expression of rdha proteins in cells withdrawn from the cstr indicated their involvement in this process d mccartyi strain cbdb1 contains 32 different reductive dehalogenase operons on the genome each constituted by one rdha and one rdhb gene plus regulatory genes which encode the catalytic enzyme rdha and its putative membrane anchor rdhb however so far no clear correlation was established between the transcription of these rdha genes and the exposure to particular organohalides and it was suggested that a low and steady transcription of most of them occurs maillard and willemin 2019 our results contribute to this idea since up to 9 different rdha proteins were identified but only two proteins were present with high abundances in all the samples collected from the reactor this fact suggests that those two proteins actually catalyzed the debromination of dibromotyrosine on one hand we observed the specific induction of the rdha protein cbdba238 which was not identified with previous halogenated electron acceptors suggesting specificity for reduction of dibromotyrosine on the other hand the high expression of cbdba1092 supports the hypothesis that this protein could be involved in the dehalogenation of brominated oligocyclic phenolic compounds as previously suggested by yang et al 2015 when cultivating strain cbdb1 with bromophenol blue as electron acceptor in fact unpublished results from our lab showed that cbdba1092 was the only rdha identified in batch cultures when cultivating strain cbdb1 on bromophenol blue after five passages to fresh medium table 2 the rdha cbdba84 often identified in cultures of strain cbdb1 was identified in this study in all the samples although with significant abundance only at the end of the operation this rdha was initially associated with the dehalogenation of chlorinated benzenes adrian et al 2007b and it was also identified in the presence of brominated benzenes wagner et al 2012 it is worth to notice the disappearance of the reductive dehalogenase cbdba80 commonly found in protein samples of strain cbdb1 cultures which could indicate that this rdha is not broadly expressed as it was thought and more specifically cbdba80 is not specific for dehalogenation of dibromotyrosine 4 3 practical implications for the design of bioremediation strategies the stable and easily maintainable operation the resilience to face high loading rates the possibility of controlling cell density and maintaining the exponential phase of growth and the capacity of overcoming electron acceptor toxicity issues make the cstr design a promising tool for producing cells of d mccartyi strain cbdb1 for downstream applications the cstr allows the control of the growth rate and the cell number independently for producing biomass at a maximum and stable cell density for full scale applications of bioremediation it will be of paramount importance to determine i the optimum growth rate of the culture under the reactor conditions and ii the optimum influent concentration of the electron acceptor that can be handled in addition the success on growing an active culture using 3 5 dibromotyrosine that produces non toxic tyrosine makes the tandem cstr dbt the perfect choice to produce high biomass concentrations of d mccartyi strain cbdb1 for downstream processes either bioremediation processes or research experiments the only potential drawback of using 3 5 dibromotyrosine as electron acceptor is the relatively low water solubility of the end product of the dehalogenation tyrosine since at concentrations higher than 2 mm it can already trigger the formation of precipitates in the reactor this precipitate formation could be a suitable surface for biofilm formation and aggregations of bacteria could lead to mass transfer limitations which limit the d mccartyi strain cbdb1 growth however in this study such limitations were not observed despite of the formation of precipitates during periods i and ii on the contrary the precipitation of tyrosine allowed for an easy separation of it and thus its removal from the effluent by filtration hence the precipitation of tyrosine could also be seen as beneficial to obtain a clean effluent also tyrosine is a natural compound that although it is not incorporated into the metabolism from external sources by strain cbdb1 marco urrea et al 2012 it can be used by many bacteria as carbon or nitrogen source and thus it should not represent a contaminant for in situ applications so that the effluent of the reactor does not need any additional cleaning step before application for bioaugmentation due to the substrate specificity of reductive dehalogenases sometimes it is inevitable to use organohalides that are toxic or organohalides that produce toxic dehalogenated products in such cases continuous cultivation of dehalococcoides is still feasible with our reactor design as long as necessary precautions are taken the pressure monitoring could even be applied when volatile organohalides or products are involved e g dechlorination from tce to ethene in such cases an adjustment to the h2 consumption rate has to be made to compensate for partial pressure increase that is caused by the production of the volatile compound e g ethene in summary the reactor setup presented in this study is broadly applicable to other dehalococcoides or dehalogenimonas strains with organohalides other than brominated tyrosines 5 conclusions d mccartyi strain cbdb1 was successfully cultivated in continuous mode in a semi continuous stirred tank reactor and long term stable operation was achieved acetate instead of fermentable organics was used as the carbon source the simple and easy handled design the feasibility of monitoring the dehalogenation process in real time the reactor resilience to confront high organohalide loading rates and the possibility of obtaining high cell density cultures make the cstr a promising tool for stable cultivation growth on the compound 3 5 dibromotyrosine which produces non toxic tyrosine was demonstrated and molar cell yields obtained were in the same range of those previously shown for d mccartyi strain cbdb1 the specific reductive dehalogenases cbdba238 and cbdba1092 were expressed when using dibromotyrosine as electron acceptor the tandem cstr dibromotyrosine is a good choice for producing high volume of d mccartyi strain cbdb1 cultures at high biomass concentration which can be used in downstream

transformation of fh to crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides e g goethite can result in the changes of uranium u species but the effects of dom molecules on the sequestration and stability of u during fe oxyhydr oxides transformation are poorly understood in this study the associations of dom molecules with u during the coprecipitation of dom with fh were evaluated and the effects of dom molecules on the kinetics of u release during fe oxyhydr oxides transformation were investigated using a combination of fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and kinetic experiments ft icr ms results indicated that in addition to phenolic and polyphenolic compounds with higher o c ratios portions of phenolic compounds with lower o c ratios and aliphatic compounds were also contributed to uo2 2 binding when fh coprecipitated with dom in comparison phenolic and polyphenolic compounds with higher o c ratios and condensed aromatics were preferentially retained on fe oxyhydr oxides during the transformation xps results further suggested that the coprecipitated dom molecules facilitated the reduction of u vi to u iv during the transformation possibly through providing electrons or acting as electron shuttles the kinetic experiment results indicated that the transformation processes accelerated u release from fe oxyhydr oxides but the coprecipitated dom molecules slowed down u release our results contribute to understanding the behaviors of u and predicting the sequestration of u in the environment graphical abstract

to magnetite at a higher fe ii concentration hansel et al 2003 2005 thomasarrigo et al 2018 in addition model organic ligands and humic substances inhibited fh transformation and the extent depended on the type and carbon content of organic matter zhou et al 2018 thomasarrigo et al 2018 2019 since the constituents and properties of fe mineral changed with the transformation the environmental behavior and sequestration of their associated dissolved organic matter dom molecules and contaminants could be affected uranium u mining and related activities have resulted in large amounts of tailings in which the residual u dissolved under the impacts of leaching and weathering and then transported to surrounding rivers and lakes jain et al 2018 selvakumar et al 2018 d ding et al 2022 the speciation of u varies widely in the natural environment for u vi it can be found as aqueous uranyl ion uo2 2 complexed to inorganic and organic ligands or coprecipitated with minerals while u iv is typically present as sparingly soluble uo2 s catalano et al 2006 stewart et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 previous studies indicated that u vi could not only associate with fe oxyhydr oxides e g fh through

interactions keiluweit and kleber 2009 yang et al 2012 li et al 2015 mikutta et al 2016 the species of u changed during the fe ii catalyzed transformation of fe oxyhydr oxides for instance uranium

al 2014b marshall et al 2014 so far the effects of fe oxyhydr oxides transformation on the sequestration and stability of u and the related mechanisms have not yet been elucidated in aquatic environment dom often co exists with fe oxyhydr oxides resulting in the coprecipitation with or adsorption on fe oxyhydr oxides plach et al 2011 lalonde et al 2012 thomasarrigo et al 2014 dom molecules high in oxygenated groups aromaticity and molecular weight mw were selectively coprecipitated or adsorbed by fe oxyhydr oxides while molecules containing few oxygenated groups and with low aromaticity and mw were preferentially retained in solution chen et al 2014 lv et al 2016 linkhorst et al 2017 ding et al 2022 and the amorphous fh showed high affinity to dom molecules compared with crystalline lepidocrocite and goethite lv et al 2016 therefore the changed constituents and properties of fe oxyhydr oxides during the transformation processes will affect the distributions of dom molecules within solid and solution phases furthermore it is likely that the variations of dom composition and properties alter the species and distributions of u during the transformation of fe oxyhydr oxides since the coprecipitated and adsorbed molecules on fe oxyhydr oxides may provide additional reactive sites for u binding keiluweit and kleber 2009 yang et al 2013 and act as electron shuttles or provide electrons for u vi reduction klüpfel et al 2014 tan et al 2017 lv et al 2018 walpen et al 2018 overall previous studies mainly focused on the complexations of u with the functional groups of organic matter and the variations of u species during the transformation of fe oxyhydr oxides whereas the effects of dom molecules on the sequestration and stability of u on fe oxyhydr oxides during the transformation to our best knowledge are still largely unknown the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of dom molecules on the sequestration of u during the fe ii catalyzed transformation of fe oxyhydr oxides a particular aim of this research was to identify dom molecules bound with u the release properties of dom molecules from fe oxyhydr oxides during the transformation were also to be elucidated furthermore the influence of dom molecules on the stability of u on fe oxyhydr oxides during the transformation was to be evaluated by conducting the kinetic experiments of u release and the mechanisms controlling u release in the presence of dom were to be revealed it was expected that the study would contribute to understanding the environmental behaviors of dom molecules and u and help to predict the sequestration of u in the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 dom preparation in order to avoid the interference of u in contaminated sediment for our experiments the uncontaminated sediment sample 0 20 cm was collected from a lake near the uranium tailings pond at the hunan province china this lake is located near a village covers an area of approximately 0 2 km2 and contains few aquatic plants sediment sample was obtained at the sampling site with little artificial disturbance and then freeze dried and homogenized for dom extraction 60 g sediment was dissolved in 100 ml of deionized di water and the suspension was shaken for 24 h at room temperature to obtain most of the water soluble organic matter then the suspension was centrifuged and filtrated through 0 45 µm polyether sulfone filter anpel china the filtrated dom sample was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for further experiments it should be noted that dom sample was extracted by shaking dry sediment in di water to obtain most of water soluble organic matter as much as possible and also to acquire a suitable dissolved organic carbon concentration for transformation experiments and dom characterizations 2 2 synthesis and transformation experiments of fh u and fh dom u coprecipitates for the preparation of fh u coprecipitates i e c fe 0 uo2 2 uranyl nitrate was added into fecl3 6h2o solution and the solution ph was adjusted to 7 5 by adding naoh slowly then the suspension was agitated to form fh u coprecipitates after 24 h fh u coprecipitates were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 15 min and the synthesized solid was washed three times using di water finally fh u coprecipitates were resuspended in di water for further transformation experiments for the preparation of fh dom u coprecipitates dom and uo2 2 were added into fecl3 6h2o solution and the rest of the steps referred to the synthetic methods of fh u coprecipitates the final mass ratio of u fe was 0 048 for fh u and fh dom u coprecipitates and the molar ratio of c to fe was 0 22 or 0 49 for fh dom u coprecipitates to investigate the associations of dom molecules with uo2 2 fh dom coprecipitates were also synthesized the filtrates of the final suspensions were collected for ft icr ms analysis the synthetic processes of all coprecipitates were conducted in an argon ar2 filled glove box mikrouna super 1220 750 900 and the contents of oxygen and water were less than 1 ppm the chemical reagent solution and di water were purged with ar2 to eliminate the interference of oxygen the prepared fh u or fh dom u coprecipitate suspension 1 g fh l 1 was added into teflon bottle then fe ii fecl2 4h2o was added into the suspension to catalyze the transformation of fh the concentration of fe ii was set to 1 mm which may be close to the concentration of fe ii in natural aquatic systems chen et al 2015 boland et al 2014a the solution ph was maintained at 6 5 0 2 by adding naoh or hcl during the mineral transformation processes suspension samples were collected at the specific sampling times 0 8 24 48 72 120 168 and 336 h the suspension was centrifuged and

detector fe oxyhydr oxide suspensions collected from the transformation experiments of fh u and fh dom u coprecipitates were diluted by ethyl alcohol and ultrasonic treatment was applied for 10 min

coprecipitation of dom with fh in the presence or absence of uo2 2 fh dom u or fh dom coprecipitates were prepared for ft icr ms analysis to investigate the associations of dom molecules with uo2 2 it should be noted that the initial concentration of dom was the same for the synthesis of fh dom u and fh dom coprecipitates in addition one dom sample collected from the transformation experiment of fh dom u coprecipitates i e initial c fe 0 49 at 336 h was also analyzed by ft icr ms to elucidate the release properties of dom molecules during the transformation before ft icr ms analysis all dom samples were prepared using solid phase extraction spe procedures bond elut ppl varian 1 g per 6 ml dittmar et al 2008 lv et al 2016 ding et al 2020 the same amount of dom was used in spe for each

molecular formula assignment which showed high reproducibility more details on spe procedures and ft icr ms analysis can be found in our previous studies ding et al 2020 2021 the modified aromaticity index ai and double binds equivalence dbe were calculated to assess the aromaticity and the number of double binds and rings of dom molecules respectively kim et al 2003 koch and dittmar 2006 ai 1 c 0

molecular property of dom molecules was calculated as following r f u i u i u max where the iu and iu max represent the sum of intensities of molecules in a certain range u and the maximum value of iu for a specific molecular property respectively the van krevelen vk diagrams were constructed based on ai h c and o c ratios and dom molecules were assigned to four groups kellerman et al 2014 2015

the averages of h c h c avg o c o c avg ai ai avg dbe dbe avg and m z m z avg were calculated based on the relative intensity ri of each dom molecule the relative abundance of each compound group was calculated by summing the relative intensities of all molecules in each compound group 2 5 kinetic experiments of u release during the transformation to evaluate the effects of fe oxyhydr oxides transformation and dom molecules on the stability of u fe oxyhydr oxides collected from the transformation experiments of fh u and fh dom u coprecipitates at 0 72 and 336 h were used to conduct kinetic experiments of u release in the short term e g several hours with a stirred flow reactor figure s1 the background electrolytes contained 10 mmol l 1 nano3 buffered with 10 mmol l 1 4 morpholineethanesulfonic acid mes ph 6 5 for the kinetic experiments an aliquot of fe oxyhydr oxide sample i e 50 mg and a magnetic stir bar were placed into the stirred flow reactor volume 7 5 ml then the reactor was filled with background electrolyte to prevent the outflow of fe oxyhydr oxide particles a filter membrane with a 25 mm diameter and 0 22 µm pore sizes was sealed on the reactor the suspension was stirred at 500 rpm and the background electrolyte solution was then pumped through the reactor for 2 h release experiment the flow rate was set to 1 ml min 1 during the whole experiment and the effluent solution was collected every 5 min it should be noted that the flow rate and mixing rate can be well controlled to ensure a well mixing of the diluted suspensions in the reactor and the continuous flow during the kinetic experiments which minimizes the diffusion limitation tian et al 2017 wang et al 2020 all effluent solution samples were acidified with concentrated hno3 the concentration of u in effluent solution was then analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7700 agilent technologies usa all experiments were conducted at room temperature 25 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of dom on fe mineral composition and properties during the transformation fe oxyhydr oxides collected from the transformation processes of fh u and fh dom u coprecipitates at 0 24 72 and 336 h were characterized by xrd and ftir to investigate the effects of dom on fe mineral constituents as shown in fig 1 and figure s2 lepidocrocite and goethite were the predominant products during the transformation of fh u coprecipitates i e c fe 0 at fe ii concentration of 1 mm after 24 h of transformation fh mainly transformed to lepidocrocite and the peaks of goethite e g the 110 and 151 planes of goethite also appeared with further increasing transformation time the peak intensities of goethite enhanced gradually at a lower c fe molar ratio i e 0 22 it appeared that dom mainly affected the formation of goethite and had little effect on the transformation of fh to lepidocrocite fig 1 previous study revealed that a higher concentration of solid associated fe ii would favor the formation of goethite in the pure fh system e g without dom while a lower concentration would enhance the precipitation of lepidocrocite boland et al 2014a in this study although the presence of dom increased the concentration of solid associated fe ii table s1 the formation of goethite was inhibited this may be attributed to the fact that dom molecules occupied the reactive sites and prevented fe ii adsorption onto fe oxyhydr oxides surface thus inhibiting fe atom exchange between aqueous fe ii and structural fe iii jones et al 2009 zhou et al 2018 thomasarrigo et al 2018 with the increase of c fe from 0 22 to 0 49 the transformation of fh was dramatically inhibited within 72 h however the peaks of lepidocrocite appeared obviously after 336 h of transformation possibly due to the release of dom molecules from fe oxyhydr oxides which provided available sites for fe ii sorption and then the increased fe atom exchange between fe ii and structural fe iii the tem images of fh u and fh dom u coprecipitates at 0 h showed nano size aggregates with an amorphous morphology and the small intra particle pore spaces with increasing transformation time fh mainly converted to minerals with lamellar structure and needle like nano particles at c fe 0 fig 2 a based on xrd and ftir results and previous studies hu et al 2018 lu et al 2019 the newly formed minerals were lepidocrocite and goethite at c fe 0 22 however the transformation of fh to goethite may be inhibited during the transformation within 72 h fig 2b as the goethite formed at c fe 0 22 was smaller and shorter than that formed at c fe 0 the inhibition effects of dom on the formation of crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides were significantly enhanced at c fe 0 49 and even after 336 h of transformation some cloud like fh aggregates covered on the lepidocrocite and goethite fig 2c results of tem analysis visually indicated that the morphology and structure of the newly formed fe oxyhydr oxides were significantly influenced by c fe molar ratio which was complementary to previous findings that model organic matter e g organic ligands and humic substances affected the degree and pathways of fe mineral transformation thomasarrigo et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 3 2 identification of dom molecules bound with u the original dom sample original dom and supernatant sample after coprecipitation in the absence of u supernatant 1 were analyzed using ft icr ms it showed that the distributions of o c ai dbe and m z shifted to lower values while the distribution of h c shifted to higher value after the coprecipitation of dom with fh fig 3 meanwhile the values of o c avg ai avg dbe avg and m z avg were lower in supernatant 1 than in original dom table s2 suggesting that dom molecules with high o content aromaticity unsaturation and molecular weight were preferentially coprecipitated by fh analysis based on vk diagrams further indicated that highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds with high o c ratios and condensed aromatics were selectively coprecipitated by fh figure s3 similar to the adsorptive fractionation behavior of dom molecules on fe oxyhydr oxides lv et al 2016 liu et al 2019 to illuminate the effects of dom molecules on uo2 2 binding on fh the supernatant sample after coprecipitation in the presence of u supernatant 2 was further analyzed by ft icr ms as shown in fig 3 the distributions of o c ai dbe and m z shifted to lower values in supernatant 2 compared with supernatant 1 indicating that the presence of uo2 2 enhanced the fractionation of dom molecules on fh during the coprecipitation which was supported by the analysis of vk diagrams figure s3 this may be attributed to the ion bridging between dom molecules and fh through uo2 2 and the formation of fe u dom ternary complexes which was similar to the bridging of divalent cations e g ca during the adsorption of dom onto fe and aluminum oxides majzik and tombácz 2007 liu et al 2019 these results suggested that dom molecules with high oxygen aromaticity unsaturation and molecular weight including the phenolic and polyphenolic molecules with high o c ratios and condensed aromatic molecules may be tightly related to uo2 2 binding furthermore we picked out the molecules related to uo2 2 binding based on the absence presence and the changed relative intensities of molecules in supernatant 2 compared with original dom and supernatant 1 and then vk diagrams were plotted fig 4 fig 4a showed the common molecules among original dom supernatant 1 and supernatan 2 and the color bar represented the ratio of the relative intensity of a molecule in supernatant 2 to that in original dom r a lower r value 1 for a molecule indicated a stronger coprecipitation of this molecule with fh in the presence of uo2 2 based on the affinities of molecules with fh during the coprecipitation these molecules were divided into two groups for the molecules represented by blue filled circles they mainly belonged to highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and polyphenols with higher o c ratios and their relative intensities in supernatant 1 were lower than those in original dom but higher than those in supernatant 2 the result indicated that these molecules were selectively removed from solution during the coprecipitation of dom with fh and the presence of uo2 2 further enhanced the coprecipitation processes for the molecules represented by red filled circles they mainly belonged to highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds with lower o c ratios and aliphatic compounds which featured with high hydrophobicity their relative intensities were higher in supernatant 1 than in original dom and supernatant 2 indicating that these molecules were preferentially retained in solution during the coprecipitation but the presence of uo2 2 resulted in the coprecipitation of these molecules with fh considering the fact that the hydrophobic fraction in organic matter can interact with uo2 2 and facilitate u vi transport yang et al 2012 2013 the uo2 2 thus may play a role of cation bridging in the coprecipitation of hydrophobic molecules with fh in addition other molecules possibly bound with u were presented in fig 4b based on the absence presence method which showed a consistent distribution with the molecules identified based on their relative intensities fig 4a overall uo2 2 can interact with diverse molecules in dom and thus the dynamic changes of molecules may influence the environmental behaviors of u 3 3 variations of dom composition and properties during the transformation of fh dom u coprecipitates to elucidate the release properties of dom molecules from fe oxyhydr oxides during the transformation marked in figure s4 the released dom collected from the transformation experiments of fh dom u coprecipitates with c fe molar ratio of 0 49 at 336 h was analyzed using ft icr ms for the released dom the distributions of h c o c ai and dbe were in between those of the original dom and supernatant 2 samples while the distribution of m z of the released dom showed some exceptions for molecules with low m z fig 3 additionally the values of o c avg ai avg dbe avg and m z avg and the relative intensities of highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds polyphenols and condensed aromatics were lower in the released dom than in the original dom but higher than in the supernatant 2 table s2 these results suggested that the coprecipitated molecules by fh were selectively released from fe oxyhydr oxides into solution during the transformation furthermore we defined the absent molecules and molecules with decreasing relative intensities in the supernatant 2 as the coprecipitated molecules black circles in fig 4c results of vk diagram analysis indicated that phenolic and polyphenolic compounds with lower o c ratios and aliphatic compounds were selectively released from fe oxyhydr oxides while phenolic and polyphenolic compounds with higher o c ratios and condensed aromatics were preferentially retained on fe oxyhydr oxides during the transformation fig 4c one explanation may be that the preferentially retained molecules e g phenolic and polyphenolic molecules with higher o c values formed stronger binding bonds with fe oxyhydr oxides through ligand exchange reactions compared with aliphatic molecules and phenolic and polyphenolic molecules with lower o c values han et al 2019 such release of dom molecules from fe oxyhydr oxides may further affect the environmental behaviors of u since the sequestration of u on fh was tightly associated with dom molecules with high hydrophobicity e g aliphatic molecules yang et al 2012 meanwhile results of xps analysis for c1s region showed that three carbon containing groups were detected on fe oxyhydr oxides including cc c c co and coo at c fe 0 22 the relative intensities of coo and co increased from 7 6 and 14 9 at 0 h to 10 8 and 29 9 at 336 h respectively whereas the relative intensity of cc c c decreased from 77 5 at 0 h to 59 3 at 336 h figure s5 similar trends were also found at c fe 0 49 figure s5 above results suggested that dom molecules high in oxygenated groups were selectively retained by fe oxyhydr oxides while alkanes were preferentially released into solution with the transformation of fe oxyhydr oxides which was consistent with ft icr ms findings 3 4 effects of dom on the chemical species and stability of u during the transformation of fe minerals fe oxyhydr oxides collected at 0 72 and 336 h during the transformation of fh u and fh dom u coprecipitates were characterized for the chemical species of u using xps fig 5 for c fe 0 u existed in the form of u vi on fh at 0 h fig 5a after 72 h of transformation u iv appeared and its relative contribution to total u was 11 0 with further transformation 336 h the relative abundance of u iv increased from 11 0 to 13 4 while the relative abundance of u vi decreased from 78 9 to 76 5 the enhanced reduction of u vi during the transformation may be attributed to the increased formation of goethite see xrd and ftir results since goethite can reduce u vi to u iv in the presence of fe ii stewart et al 2009 2015 as shown in fig 5b the relative abundance of u iv was higher at c fe 0 22 22 2 at 72 h and 26 6 at 336 h than at c fe 0 it is interesting to note that the coprecipitated dom molecules showed some inhibitions on the formation of goethite during fh transformation fig 1 and figure s2 previous studies have revealed that phenolic and polyphenolic compounds mainly contributed to the electron transfer capacities of dom tan et al 2017 lv et al 2018 it is thus reasonable to conclude that dom facilitated the reduction of u vi possibly through providing additional electrons or acting as electron shuttles by the preferentially coprecipitated phenolic and polyphenolic molecules see ft icr ms results however with c fe molar ratio increasing from 0 22 to 0 49 the relative abundance of u iv decreased fig 5c which may be ascribed to the strong inhibition of the high organic matter content on the formation of goethite fig 1 and figure s2 the kinetics of u release from fe oxyhydr oxides was explored to elucidate the effects of the transformation and dom molecules on the stability of the sequestrated u by fe oxyhydr oxides fig 6 a showed that u concentration in solution increased gradually with increasing transformation time suggesting that the transformation processes enhanced the release of u from fe oxyhydr oxides the possible explanations for this behavior were that the fe ii catalyzed transformation of fh to lepidocrocite and goethite reduced the surface area and binding sites table s3 and induced the release of hydrophobic molecules e g aliphatic compounds that bound with u in addition the presence of dom reduced the release of u during the transformation and the amount of the released u decreased with increasing c fe molar ratio the coprecipitated dom can not only slow down the decrease of the reactive sites on fe oxyhydr oxides by hindering the transformation processes and provide additional sites for uo2 2 binding e g carboxylic and aromatic groups but also accelerate the reduction of u vi to insoluble u iv thus decreasing the release of u furthermore results of stirred flow experiments showed that the effluent u concentration increased with the transformation figs 6b d which suggested that the transformation of fh to lepidocrocite and goethite enhanced the release of u from fe oxyhydr oxides this result was consistent with the variation of u concentration in solution during the transformation of fe oxyhydr oxides fig 6a previous studies have demonstrated that the reactive sites on amorphous fh are dominated by singly coordinated feoh surface hydroxyl while triply coordinated fe3oh surface hydroxyl is the main reactive sites on crystalline lepidocrocite or goethite boily et al 2001 hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2009 lv et al 2016 moreover singly coordinated groups exhibit a higher affinity to dom molecules than triply coordinated groups lv et al 2016 which may be contributed to the increased release of u during the transformation in comparison the coprecipitated dom slowed down the release of u from fe oxyhydr oxides partially because of the occupation of binding sites on fe oxyhydr oxides that would fast release bound u into solution meanwhile the coprecipitated dom can lower the positive charge of fe oxyhydr oxides and enhance the electrostatic reactions between fe oxyhydr oxides and uo2 2 in addition molecules high in carboxylic and aromatic groups e g phenolic and polyphenolic molecules with high o c ratios were selectively coprecipitated by fh and preferentially retained by fe oxyhydr oxides during the transformation carboxylic and aromatic groups can interact with uo2 2 through ligand exchange interactions yang et al 2013 mikutta et al 2016 and electron donor receptor interactions keiluweit and kleber 2009 respectively which may provide stronger binding sites for uo2 2 than fe oxyhydr oxides the carboxylic and aromatic groups bound u thus desorbed relatively slower compared with fe oxyhydr oxides bound u 4 conclusion in this study effects of dom molecules on u sequestration and stability during the transformation of fe oxyhydr oxides were elaborated results indicated that phenolic and polyphenolic molecules with high o c ratios and hydrophobic molecules e g aliphatic compounds were tightly associated with the sequestration of uo2 2 during the coprecipitation of dom with fh furthermore the coprecipitated dom molecules hindered the transformation of fh to crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides and the preferentially retained phenolic and polyphenolic molecules with high o c ratios enhanced the reduction of u vi to u iv during the transformation which mainly contributed to the significantly decreased release of u however the reduction of u vi and the release of u from fe oxyhydr oxides decreased with c fe molar ratio increasing from 0 22 to 0 49 which may be ascribed to the strong inhibition of the high organic matter content on the formation of lepidocrocite and goethite these results highlighted the importance of the molecular properties of the coprecipitated dom on the species and kinetic behaviors of u since we conducted the transformation experiments at a constant ph value and under the anoxic conditions it is desired to evaluate the effects of dom molecules on u sequestration and stability on fe oxyhydr oxides under various environmental conditions e g ph and redox fluctuations overall our findings shed light on the dynamic variations of dom molecules as a critical driver of u sequestration and stability during the transformation of fh dom u coprecipitates which have significant implications for predicting the environmental behavior of u and remediating u contaminated environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15213,amorphous ferrihydrite fh is abundant in aquatic environments and sediments and often coprecipitates with dissolved organic matter dom to form mineral organic aggregates the fe ii catalyzed transformation of fh to crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides e g goethite can result in the changes of uranium u species but the effects of dom molecules on the sequestration and stability of u during fe oxyhydr oxides transformation are poorly understood in this study the associations of dom molecules with u during the coprecipitation of dom with fh were evaluated and the effects of dom molecules on the kinetics of u release during fe oxyhydr oxides transformation were investigated using a combination of fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and kinetic experiments ft icr ms results indicated that in addition to phenolic and polyphenolic compounds with higher o c ratios portions of phenolic compounds with lower o c ratios and aliphatic compounds were also contributed to uo2 2 binding when fh coprecipitated with dom in comparison phenolic and polyphenolic compounds with higher o c ratios and condensed aromatics were preferentially retained on fe oxyhydr oxides during the transformation xps results further suggested that the coprecipitated dom molecules facilitated the reduction of u vi to u iv during the transformation possibly through providing electrons or acting as electron shuttles the kinetic experiment results indicated that the transformation processes accelerated u release from fe oxyhydr oxides but the coprecipitated dom molecules slowed down u release our results contribute to understanding the behaviors of u and predicting the sequestration of u in the environment graphical abstract

to magnetite at a higher fe ii concentration hansel et al 2003 2005 thomasarrigo et al 2018 in addition model organic ligands and humic substances inhibited fh transformation and the extent depended on the type and carbon content of organic matter zhou et al 2018 thomasarrigo et al 2018 2019 since the constituents and properties of fe mineral changed with the transformation the environmental behavior and sequestration of their associated dissolved organic matter dom molecules and contaminants could be affected uranium u mining and related activities have resulted in large amounts of tailings in which the residual u dissolved under the impacts of leaching and weathering and then transported to surrounding rivers and lakes jain et al 2018 selvakumar et al 2018 d ding et al 2022 the speciation of u varies widely in the natural environment for u vi it can be found as aqueous uranyl ion uo2 2 complexed to inorganic and organic ligands or coprecipitated with minerals while u iv is typically present as sparingly soluble uo2 s catalano et al 2006 stewart et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 previous studies indicated that u vi could not only associate with fe oxyhydr oxides e g fh through

interactions keiluweit and kleber 2009 yang et al 2012 li et al 2015 mikutta et al 2016 the species of u changed during the fe ii catalyzed transformation of fe oxyhydr oxides for instance uranium

al 2014b marshall et al 2014 so far the effects of fe oxyhydr oxides transformation on the sequestration and stability of u and the related mechanisms have not yet been elucidated in aquatic environment dom often co exists with fe oxyhydr oxides resulting in the coprecipitation with or adsorption on fe oxyhydr oxides plach et al 2011 lalonde et al 2012 thomasarrigo et al 2014 dom molecules high in oxygenated groups aromaticity and molecular weight mw were selectively coprecipitated or adsorbed by fe oxyhydr oxides while molecules containing few oxygenated groups and with low aromaticity and mw were preferentially retained in solution chen et al 2014 lv et al 2016 linkhorst et al 2017 ding et al 2022 and the amorphous fh showed high affinity to dom molecules compared with crystalline lepidocrocite and goethite lv et al 2016 therefore the changed constituents and properties of fe oxyhydr oxides during the transformation processes will affect the distributions of dom molecules within solid and solution phases furthermore it is likely that the variations of dom composition and properties alter the species and distributions of u during the transformation of fe oxyhydr oxides since the coprecipitated and adsorbed molecules on fe oxyhydr oxides may provide additional reactive sites for u binding keiluweit and kleber 2009 yang et al 2013 and act as electron shuttles or provide electrons for u vi reduction klüpfel et al 2014 tan et al 2017 lv et al 2018 walpen et al 2018 overall previous studies mainly focused on the complexations of u with the functional groups of organic matter and the variations of u species during the transformation of fe oxyhydr oxides whereas the effects of dom molecules on the sequestration and stability of u on fe oxyhydr oxides during the transformation to our best knowledge are still largely unknown the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of dom molecules on the sequestration of u during the fe ii catalyzed transformation of fe oxyhydr oxides a particular aim of this research was to identify dom molecules bound with u the release properties of dom molecules from fe oxyhydr oxides during the transformation were also to be elucidated furthermore the influence of dom molecules on the stability of u on fe oxyhydr oxides during the transformation was to be evaluated by conducting the kinetic experiments of u release and the mechanisms controlling u release in the presence of dom were to be revealed it was expected that the study would contribute to understanding the environmental behaviors of dom molecules and u and help to predict the sequestration of u in the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 dom preparation in order to avoid the interference of u in contaminated sediment for our experiments the uncontaminated sediment sample 0 20 cm was collected from a lake near the uranium tailings pond at the hunan province china this lake is located near a village covers an area of approximately 0 2 km2 and contains few aquatic plants sediment sample was obtained at the sampling site with little artificial disturbance and then freeze dried and homogenized for dom extraction 60 g sediment was dissolved in 100 ml of deionized di water and the suspension was shaken for 24 h at room temperature to obtain most of the water soluble organic matter then the suspension was centrifuged and filtrated through 0 45 µm polyether sulfone filter anpel china the filtrated dom sample was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for further experiments it should be noted that dom sample was extracted by shaking dry sediment in di water to obtain most of water soluble organic matter as much as possible and also to acquire a suitable dissolved organic carbon concentration for transformation experiments and dom characterizations 2 2 synthesis and transformation experiments of fh u and fh dom u coprecipitates for the preparation of fh u coprecipitates i e c fe 0 uo2 2 uranyl nitrate was added into fecl3 6h2o solution and the solution ph was adjusted to 7 5 by adding naoh slowly then the suspension was agitated to form fh u coprecipitates after 24 h fh u coprecipitates were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 15 min and the synthesized solid was washed three times using di water finally fh u coprecipitates were resuspended in di water for further transformation experiments for the preparation of fh dom u coprecipitates dom and uo2 2 were added into fecl3 6h2o solution and the rest of the steps referred to the synthetic methods of fh u coprecipitates the final mass ratio of u fe was 0 048 for fh u and fh dom u coprecipitates and the molar ratio of c to fe was 0 22 or 0 49 for fh dom u coprecipitates to investigate the associations of dom molecules with uo2 2 fh dom coprecipitates were also synthesized the filtrates of the final suspensions were collected for ft icr ms analysis the synthetic processes of all coprecipitates were conducted in an argon ar2 filled glove box mikrouna super 1220 750 900 and the contents of oxygen and water were less than 1 ppm the chemical reagent solution and di water were purged with ar2 to eliminate the interference of oxygen the prepared fh u or fh dom u coprecipitate suspension 1 g fh l 1 was added into teflon bottle then fe ii fecl2 4h2o was added into the suspension to catalyze the transformation of fh the concentration of fe ii was set to 1 mm which may be close to the concentration of fe ii in natural aquatic systems chen et al 2015 boland et al 2014a the solution ph was maintained at 6 5 0 2 by adding naoh or hcl during the mineral transformation processes suspension samples were collected at the specific sampling times 0 8 24 48 72 120 168 and 336 h the suspension was centrifuged and

equipment was operated at 40 kv and 40 ma by step scanning from 10 to 70 2θ at a scan speed of 5 min 1 ftir was further used to identify the variations of fe mineral phases during the transformation of the coprecipitates each ftir spectrum was recorded after 32 scans with 4 cm 1 resolution using a nicolet is10 spectrometer thermofisher scientific usa with a deuterated triglycine sulfate dtgs detector fe oxyhydr oxide suspensions collected from the transformation experiments of fh u and fh dom u coprecipitates were diluted by ethyl alcohol and ultrasonic treatment was applied for 10 min then a 20 μl of suspension was pipetted onto an ultrathin carbon film 3 5 nm thickness and dried for 5 min using an infrared lamp all prepared samples were analyzed by employing a talos f200x g2 analytical tem thermo scientific operated at 200 kv in stem mode which has a spatial resolution of 0 16 nm high resolution tem images of the samples were obtained to visualize the morphologies and constituents of fe oxyhydr oxides during the transformation nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms 77 k of the selected fe oxyhydr oxide samples were obtained using a gemini vii2390 surface area analyzer micromeritics usa brunauer emmett teller bet method was employed to calculate the specific surface areas of fe oxyhydr oxides in addition to characterize the chemical species of u and the functional groups of c fe oxyhydr oxide samples obtained from the transformation experiments of fh u and fh dom u coprecipitates at 0 72 and 336 h were analyzed by xps with a thermo fisher scientific k alpha machine with an al kα x ray source 1486 8 ev of photons at 15 kv and 10 ma 2 4 ft icr ms measurement and data analysis the original dom sample and two supernatant samples after the coprecipitation of dom with fh in the presence or absence of uo2 2 fh dom u or fh dom coprecipitates were prepared for ft icr ms analysis to investigate the associations of dom molecules with uo2 2 it should be noted that the initial concentration of dom was the same for the synthesis of fh dom u and fh dom coprecipitates in addition one dom sample collected from the transformation experiment of fh dom u coprecipitates i e initial c fe 0 49 at 336 h was also analyzed by ft icr ms to elucidate the release properties of dom molecules during the transformation before ft icr ms analysis all dom samples were prepared using solid phase extraction spe procedures bond elut ppl varian 1 g per 6 ml dittmar et al 2008 lv et al 2016 ding et al 2020 the same amount of dom was used in spe for each sample to mitigate artifacts and the extraction efficiency exceeded 58 based on toc contents of dom samples before and after spe the samples were analyzed using a 9 4 t bruker apex ultra ft icr mass spectrometer with a negative ion apollo ii esi an in house standard method was used for dom molecular characterization by ft icr ms which showed good repeatability and reproducibility he et al 2020 the mass range was m z mass to charge ratio 200 800 da and the mass error for a formula between the theoretical mass and measured mass was less than 1 ppm formulas were assigned to peaks according to the criteria 1 signal to noise ratio 6 2 c 5h 3o 1n0 3s0 1 3 o c 1 2 and h c 2 2 the reference fulvic acid suwannee river fulvic acid was used to test the reproducibility of the peak detection and the molecular formula assignment which showed high reproducibility more details on spe procedures and ft icr ms analysis can be found in our previous studies ding et al 2020 2021 the modified aromaticity index ai and double binds equivalence dbe were calculated to assess the aromaticity and the number of double binds and rings of dom molecules respectively kim et al 2003 koch and dittmar 2006 ai 1 c 0 5 o s 0 5 h c 0 5 o s n dbe 1 1 2 2 c h n where c h n o and s represent the number of carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen and sulfur atoms per formula respectively the relative frequency rf of a specific molecular property of dom molecules was calculated as following r f u i u i u max where the iu and iu max represent the sum of intensities of molecules in a certain range u and the maximum value of iu for a specific molecular property respectively the van krevelen vk diagrams were constructed based on ai h c and o c ratios and dom molecules were assigned to four groups kellerman et al 2014 2015

the averages of h c h c avg o c o c avg ai ai avg dbe dbe avg and m z m z avg were calculated based on the relative intensity ri of each dom molecule the relative abundance of each compound group was calculated by summing the relative intensities of all molecules in each compound group 2 5 kinetic experiments of u release during the transformation to evaluate the effects of fe oxyhydr oxides transformation and dom molecules on the stability of u fe oxyhydr oxides collected from the transformation experiments of fh u and fh dom u coprecipitates at 0 72 and 336 h were used to conduct kinetic experiments of u release in the short term e g several hours with a stirred flow reactor figure s1 the background electrolytes contained 10 mmol l 1 nano3 buffered with 10 mmol l 1 4 morpholineethanesulfonic acid mes ph 6 5 for the kinetic experiments an aliquot of fe oxyhydr oxide sample i e 50 mg and a magnetic stir bar were placed into the stirred flow reactor volume 7 5 ml then the reactor was filled with background electrolyte to prevent the outflow of fe oxyhydr oxide particles a filter membrane with a 25 mm diameter and 0 22 µm pore sizes was sealed on the reactor the suspension was stirred at 500 rpm and the background electrolyte solution was then pumped through the reactor for 2 h release experiment the flow rate was set to 1 ml min 1 during the whole experiment and the effluent solution was collected every 5 min it should be noted that the flow rate and mixing rate can be well controlled to ensure a well mixing of the diluted suspensions in the reactor and the continuous flow during the kinetic experiments which minimizes the diffusion limitation tian et al 2017 wang et al 2020 all effluent solution samples were acidified with concentrated hno3 the concentration of u in effluent solution was then analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7700 agilent technologies usa all experiments were conducted at room temperature 25 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of dom on fe mineral composition and properties during the transformation fe oxyhydr oxides collected from the transformation processes of fh u and fh dom u coprecipitates at 0 24 72 and 336 h were characterized by xrd and ftir to investigate the effects of dom on fe mineral constituents as shown in fig 1 and figure s2 lepidocrocite and goethite were the predominant products during the transformation of fh u coprecipitates i e c fe 0 at fe ii concentration of 1 mm after 24 h of transformation fh mainly transformed to lepidocrocite and the peaks of goethite e g the 110 and 151 planes of goethite also appeared with further increasing transformation time the peak intensities of goethite enhanced gradually at a lower c fe molar ratio i e 0 22 it appeared that dom mainly affected the formation of goethite and had little effect on the transformation of fh to lepidocrocite fig 1 previous study revealed that a higher concentration of solid associated fe ii would favor the formation of goethite in the pure fh system e g without dom while a lower concentration would enhance the precipitation of lepidocrocite boland et al 2014a in this study although the presence of dom increased the concentration of solid associated fe ii table s1 the formation of goethite was inhibited this may be attributed to the fact that dom molecules occupied the reactive sites and prevented fe ii adsorption onto fe oxyhydr oxides surface thus inhibiting fe atom exchange between aqueous fe ii and structural fe iii jones et al 2009 zhou et al 2018 thomasarrigo et al 2018 with the increase of c fe from 0 22 to 0 49 the transformation of fh was dramatically inhibited within 72 h however the peaks of lepidocrocite appeared obviously after 336 h of transformation possibly due to the release of dom molecules from fe oxyhydr oxides which provided available sites for fe ii sorption and then the increased fe atom exchange between fe ii and structural fe iii the tem images of fh u and fh dom u coprecipitates at 0 h showed nano size aggregates with an amorphous morphology and the small intra particle pore spaces with increasing transformation time fh mainly converted to minerals with lamellar structure and needle like nano particles at c fe 0 fig 2 a based on xrd and ftir results and previous studies hu et al 2018 lu et al 2019 the newly formed minerals were lepidocrocite and goethite at c fe 0 22 however the transformation of fh to goethite may be inhibited during the transformation within 72 h fig 2b as the goethite formed at c fe 0 22 was smaller and shorter than that formed at c fe 0 the inhibition effects of dom on the formation of crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides were significantly enhanced at c fe 0 49 and even after 336 h of transformation some cloud like fh aggregates covered on the lepidocrocite and goethite fig 2c results of tem analysis visually indicated that the morphology and structure of the newly formed fe oxyhydr oxides were significantly influenced by c fe molar ratio which was complementary to previous findings that model organic matter e g organic ligands and humic substances affected the degree and pathways of fe mineral transformation thomasarrigo et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 3 2 identification of dom molecules bound with u the original dom sample original dom and supernatant sample after coprecipitation in the absence of u supernatant 1 were analyzed using ft icr ms it showed that the distributions of o c ai dbe and m z shifted to lower values while the distribution of h c shifted to higher value after the coprecipitation of dom with fh fig 3 meanwhile the values of o c avg ai avg dbe avg and m z avg were lower in supernatant 1 than in original dom table s2 suggesting that dom molecules with high o content aromaticity unsaturation and molecular weight were preferentially coprecipitated by fh analysis based on vk diagrams further indicated that highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds with high o c ratios and condensed aromatics were selectively coprecipitated by fh figure s3 similar to the adsorptive fractionation behavior of dom molecules on fe oxyhydr oxides lv et al 2016 liu et al 2019 to illuminate the effects of dom molecules on uo2 2 binding on fh the supernatant sample after coprecipitation in the presence of u supernatant 2 was further analyzed by ft icr ms as shown in fig 3 the distributions of o c ai dbe and m z shifted to lower values in supernatant 2 compared with supernatant 1 indicating that the presence of uo2 2 enhanced the fractionation of dom molecules on fh during the coprecipitation which was supported by the analysis of vk diagrams figure s3 this may be attributed to the ion bridging between dom molecules and fh through uo2 2 and the formation of fe u dom ternary complexes which was similar to the bridging of divalent cations e g ca during the adsorption of dom onto fe and aluminum oxides majzik and tombácz 2007 liu et al 2019 these results suggested that dom molecules with high oxygen aromaticity unsaturation and molecular weight including the phenolic and polyphenolic molecules with high o c ratios and condensed aromatic molecules may be tightly related to uo2 2 binding furthermore we picked out the molecules related to uo2 2 binding based on the absence presence and the changed relative intensities of molecules in supernatant 2 compared with original dom and supernatant 1 and then vk diagrams were plotted fig 4 fig 4a showed the common molecules among original dom supernatant 1 and supernatan 2 and the color bar represented the ratio of the relative intensity of a molecule in supernatant 2 to that in original dom r a lower r value 1 for a molecule indicated a stronger coprecipitation of this molecule with fh in the presence of uo2 2 based on the affinities of molecules with fh during the coprecipitation these molecules were divided into two groups for the molecules represented by blue filled circles they mainly belonged to highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and polyphenols with higher o c ratios and their relative intensities in supernatant 1 were lower than those in original dom but higher than those in supernatant 2 the result indicated that these molecules were selectively removed from solution during the coprecipitation of dom with fh and the presence of uo2 2 further enhanced the coprecipitation processes for the molecules represented by red filled circles they mainly belonged to highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds with lower o c ratios and aliphatic compounds which featured with high hydrophobicity their relative intensities were higher in supernatant 1 than in original dom and supernatant 2 indicating that these molecules were preferentially retained in solution during the coprecipitation but the presence of uo2 2 resulted in the coprecipitation of these molecules with fh considering the fact that the hydrophobic fraction in organic matter can interact with uo2 2 and facilitate u vi transport yang et al 2012 2013 the uo2 2 thus may play a role of cation bridging in the coprecipitation of hydrophobic molecules with fh in addition other molecules possibly bound with u were presented in fig 4b based on the absence presence method which showed a consistent distribution with the molecules identified based on their relative intensities fig 4a overall uo2 2 can interact with diverse molecules in dom and thus the dynamic changes of molecules may influence the environmental behaviors of u 3 3 variations of dom composition and properties during the transformation of fh dom u coprecipitates to elucidate the release properties of dom molecules from fe oxyhydr oxides during the transformation marked in figure s4 the released dom collected from the transformation experiments of fh dom u coprecipitates with c fe molar ratio of 0 49 at 336 h was analyzed using ft icr ms for the released dom the distributions of h c o c ai and dbe were in between those of the original dom and supernatant 2 samples while the distribution of m z of the released dom showed some exceptions for molecules with low m z fig 3 additionally the values of o c avg ai avg dbe avg and m z avg and the relative intensities of highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds polyphenols and condensed aromatics were lower in the released dom than in the original dom but higher than in the supernatant 2 table s2 these results suggested that the coprecipitated molecules by fh were selectively released from fe oxyhydr oxides into solution during the transformation furthermore we defined the absent molecules and molecules with decreasing relative intensities in the supernatant 2 as the coprecipitated molecules black circles in fig 4c results of vk diagram analysis indicated that phenolic and polyphenolic compounds with lower o c ratios and aliphatic compounds were selectively released from fe oxyhydr oxides while phenolic and polyphenolic compounds with higher o c ratios and condensed aromatics were preferentially retained on fe oxyhydr oxides during the transformation fig 4c one explanation may be that the preferentially retained molecules e g phenolic and polyphenolic molecules with higher o c values formed stronger binding bonds with fe oxyhydr oxides through ligand exchange reactions compared with aliphatic molecules and phenolic and polyphenolic molecules with lower o c values han et al 2019 such release of dom molecules from fe oxyhydr oxides may further affect the environmental behaviors of u since the sequestration of u on fh was tightly associated with dom molecules with high hydrophobicity e g aliphatic molecules yang et al 2012 meanwhile results of xps analysis for c1s region showed that three carbon containing groups were detected on fe oxyhydr oxides including cc c c co and coo at c fe 0 22 the relative intensities of coo and co increased from 7 6 and 14 9 at 0 h to 10 8 and 29 9 at 336 h respectively whereas the relative intensity of cc c c decreased from 77 5 at 0 h to 59 3 at 336 h figure s5 similar trends were also found at c fe 0 49 figure s5 above results suggested that dom molecules high in oxygenated groups were selectively retained by fe oxyhydr oxides while alkanes were preferentially released into solution with the transformation of fe oxyhydr oxides which was consistent with ft icr ms findings 3 4 effects of dom on the chemical species and stability of u during the transformation of fe minerals fe oxyhydr oxides collected at 0 72 and 336 h during the transformation of fh u and fh dom u coprecipitates were characterized for the chemical species of u using xps fig 5 for c fe 0 u existed in the form of u vi on fh at 0 h fig 5a after 72 h of transformation u iv appeared and its relative contribution to total u was 11 0 with further transformation 336 h the relative abundance of u iv increased from 11 0 to 13 4 while the relative abundance of u vi decreased from 78 9 to 76 5 the enhanced reduction of u vi during the transformation may be attributed to the increased formation of goethite see xrd and ftir results since goethite can reduce u vi to u iv in the presence of fe ii stewart et al 2009 2015 as shown in fig 5b the relative abundance of u iv was higher at c fe 0 22 22 2 at 72 h and 26 6 at 336 h than at c fe 0 it is interesting to note that the coprecipitated dom molecules showed some inhibitions on the formation of goethite during fh transformation fig 1 and figure s2 previous studies have revealed that phenolic and polyphenolic compounds mainly contributed to the electron transfer capacities of dom tan et al 2017 lv et al 2018 it is thus reasonable to conclude that dom facilitated the reduction of u vi possibly through providing additional electrons or acting as electron shuttles by the preferentially coprecipitated phenolic and polyphenolic molecules see ft icr ms results however with c fe molar ratio increasing from 0 22 to 0 49 the relative abundance of u iv decreased fig 5c which may be ascribed to the strong inhibition of the high organic matter content on the formation of goethite fig 1 and figure s2 the kinetics of u release from fe oxyhydr oxides was explored to elucidate the effects of the transformation and dom molecules on the stability of the sequestrated u by fe oxyhydr oxides fig 6 a showed that u concentration in solution increased gradually with increasing transformation time suggesting that the transformation processes enhanced the release of u from fe oxyhydr oxides the possible explanations for this behavior were that the fe ii catalyzed transformation of fh to lepidocrocite and goethite reduced the surface area and binding sites table s3 and induced the release of hydrophobic molecules e g aliphatic compounds that bound with u in addition the presence of dom reduced the release of u during the transformation and the amount of the released u decreased with increasing c fe molar ratio the coprecipitated dom can not only slow down the decrease of the reactive sites on fe oxyhydr oxides by hindering the transformation processes and provide additional sites for uo2 2 binding e g carboxylic and aromatic groups but also accelerate the reduction of u vi to insoluble u iv thus decreasing the release of u furthermore results of stirred flow experiments showed that the effluent u concentration increased with the transformation figs 6b d which suggested that the transformation of fh to lepidocrocite and goethite enhanced the release of u from fe oxyhydr oxides this result was consistent with the variation of u concentration in solution during the transformation of fe oxyhydr oxides fig 6a previous studies have demonstrated that the reactive sites on amorphous fh are dominated by singly coordinated feoh surface hydroxyl while triply coordinated fe3oh surface hydroxyl is the main reactive sites on crystalline lepidocrocite or goethite boily et al 2001 hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2009 lv et al 2016 moreover singly coordinated groups exhibit a higher affinity to dom molecules than triply coordinated groups lv et al 2016 which may be contributed to the increased release of u during the transformation in comparison the coprecipitated dom slowed down the release of u from fe oxyhydr oxides partially because of the occupation of binding sites on fe oxyhydr oxides that would fast release bound u into solution meanwhile the coprecipitated dom can lower the positive charge of fe oxyhydr oxides and enhance the electrostatic reactions between fe oxyhydr oxides and uo2 2 in addition molecules high in carboxylic and aromatic groups e g phenolic and polyphenolic molecules with high o c ratios were selectively coprecipitated by fh and preferentially retained by fe oxyhydr oxides during the transformation carboxylic and aromatic groups can interact with uo2 2 through ligand exchange interactions yang et al 2013 mikutta et al 2016 and electron donor receptor interactions keiluweit and kleber 2009 respectively which may provide stronger binding sites for uo2 2 than fe oxyhydr oxides the carboxylic and aromatic groups bound u thus desorbed relatively slower compared with fe oxyhydr oxides bound u 4 conclusion in this study effects of dom molecules on u sequestration and stability during the transformation of fe oxyhydr oxides were elaborated results indicated that phenolic and polyphenolic molecules with high o c ratios and hydrophobic molecules e g aliphatic compounds were tightly associated with the sequestration of uo2 2 during the coprecipitation of dom with fh furthermore the coprecipitated dom molecules hindered the transformation of fh to crystalline fe oxyhydr oxides and the preferentially retained phenolic and polyphenolic molecules with high o c ratios enhanced the reduction of u vi to u iv during the transformation which mainly contributed to the significantly decreased release of u however the reduction of u vi and the release of u from fe oxyhydr oxides decreased with c fe molar ratio increasing from 0 22 to 0 49 which may be ascribed to the strong inhibition of the high organic matter content on the formation of lepidocrocite and goethite these results highlighted the importance of the molecular properties of the coprecipitated dom on the species and kinetic behaviors of u since we conducted the transformation experiments at a constant ph value and under the anoxic conditions it is desired to evaluate the effects of dom molecules on u sequestration and stability on fe oxyhydr oxides under various environmental conditions e g ph and redox fluctuations overall our findings shed light on the dynamic variations of dom molecules as a critical driver of u sequestration and stability during the transformation of fh dom u coprecipitates which have significant implications for predicting the environmental behavior of u and remediating u contaminated environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15214,photocatalytic and photothermal disinfection is a promising strategy for addressing the challenges of environmental microbial contamination in this work we choose a metal organic framework mof zif 8 as an inexpensive and ideal model for metal ion doping and manipulate the band structure thermal vibration in molecules charge distribution and robustness of the metal ligand coordination bond of the metal ion doped zifs for their use in photo disinfection the effects of their absorption edge rate of the photo induced temperature rise transient photocurrent response photo generated reactive oxygen species ros type and crystal stability on the photo disinfection performance are systematically studied by varying the metal ion type co2 ni2 or cu2 and doping concentration 1 100 the results show that the efficiency of light harvesting and photogenerated carrier separation is facilitated in all doped zifs the photothermal conversion gradually improves with the increasing concentration of doped co2 cu2 remarkably the photo generated ros type changes from the original singlet oxygen 1o2 to multiple ros 1o2 and o2 due to the introduction of co ii sites consequently compared with pristine zif 8 and other doped zifs co2 doped zif 8 with a 5 doping concentration shows the highest sterilization efficiency 6 6 log10 cfu ml 1 against escherichia coli e coli under simulated sunlight within

pathogenic bacteria e g gram negative and gram positive bacteria etc has become a serious and ever increasing global problem particularly in water security wang et al 2018 tang et al 2020 in such a situation various water disinfection techniques such as chlorination ultraviolet irradiation ozonation nanofiltration and electrolysis have been developed to address this problem wei et al 2022 backer et al 2019 wang et al 2021a as some of these techniques inevitably have disadvantages such as low efficiency long residence time high cost easy recolonization and secondary pollution researchers are turning their attention to the use of photo sterilization as an environmentally friendly low cost and effective alternative zhang et al 2020a 2020b li et al 2021 for decades various functional materials such as tio2 wo3 mos2 metal organic frameworks mofs covalent organic frameworks cofs and graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 have been widely used to develop the promising photo sterilization technique li et al 2021 liu et al 2016 esrafili et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 ren et al 2018 among these reported materials mofs with abundant accessible active sites and tunable inorganic and organic components have attracted rising attention in the past few years and are considered as the most promising candidate for photo sterilization pettinari et al 2021 some pristine mof materials such as mil 100 fe zif 8 zif 11 hn2 mil 125 hn2 uio 66 hf tcpp bit 66 and pcn 224 have been reported to have high photocatalytic bactericidal activity deng et al 2019 ma et al 2020 chen et al 2020 li et al 2019a however due to the limitations of their inherent characteristics such as the large band gap and single ligand to metal charge transfer lmct mode pristine mofs exhibited the low ability to harvest light and separate photon generated electron hole making it difficult to further reduce the cost shorten time and enhance efficiency in water sterilization li et al 2021 pettinari et al 2021 deng et al 2019 ma et al 2020 chen et al 2020 furthermore the contribution of the photothermal effect in photo sterilization cannot be ignored zhang et al 2020b yougbare et al 2020 many mof materials have shown the satisfactory photothermal conversion capability but have not been applied in this field song et al 2022 xiao and jiang 2019 hence the coordination between the photocatalytic activities and the photothermal effects is the key to improving the photo sterilization efficiency of mofs metal ion doping in the metal nodes of mofs has been proved to be a perfect strategy to achieve this objective it can bring a number of advantages 1 the band structures of mofs can be adjusted and thus their light absorption ranges are broadened chen et al 2020 xiao and jiang 2019 li et al 2019b sun et al 2013 thanh et al 2017 chen et al reported the partial substitution of the zirconium zr ions by titanium ti ions into the clusters of pcn 224 to extend its light response in the visible region and cause more efficient reactive oxygen species ros generation resulting in the enhanced antibacterial activity against mdr gram positive negative pathogens chen et al 2020 li et al revealed that the mechanism of the photothermal enhancement of zinc doped prussian blue was the band gap narrowing effect and the redshifted localized surface plasmon resonance lspr caused by zinc ions doping li et al 2019b 2 the intrinsic d d transitions can be triggered by the doped metal ions e g co2 and cu2 under near infrared irradiation resulting in the introduction of an additional light energy conversion photothermal conversion module xiao and jiang 2019 han et al 2020 zou et al 2021 han et al confirmed that introducing cu2 into the porphyrin ligands of pcn 224 enhanced its photocatalytic activity and photothermal effect in the sterilization process han et al 2020 3 new metal to metal charge transfer mmct modes are introduced to promote the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron hole pairs li et al 2021 xu et al 2019 4 metal ion doping has also been shown to improve the water stability of some mofs zhou et al 2017 although the effects of these advantages on the photocatalytic performances of mofs have been investigated separately the improvement in the photo sterilization performance has not been studied in detail sun et al 2013 thanh et al 2017 zou et al 2021 xu et al 2019 zhou et al 2017 therefore it is still necessary to develop new metal ion doped mof antibacterial materials with simple synthesis process low cost high stability and excellent bactericidal performance and systematically explore the relationship between the type and concentration of doped metal ions and the performance and mechanism photocatalytic activity and selectivity photothermal effect in water sterilization herein we choose the cheap and easy to synthesize zif 8 with high photocatalytic bactericidal performance to act as an ideal model for metal ion doping and introduce the light absorbing metal ions co2 ni2 or cu2 into the metal nodes of zif 8 to obtain a series of metal ions doped zif 8 denoted as m x zn y zif m co ni cu where x and y represented the different feeding molar ratio between m2 and zn2 with different doping concentrations furthermore their photocatalytic activity and selectivity photothermal effects and crystal stability in sterilization are systematically investigated this work provides insights into the photo sterilization of mofs doped with different metal ions and doping concentrations which have important implications for the

and commercial tio2 nanoparticles all instruments should be disinfected before the bactericidal experiments at 121 c in a high pressure steam sterilization pot e coli was grown in an lb broth at 37 c for 17 h with a shaking speed of 200 rpm to yield a cell count of approximately 108 colony forming units cfu ml 1 consecutively bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in a sterile saline solution 0 9 w v the concentration of bacteria used in the bactericidal experiments was adjusted to 106 cfu ml 1 by gradient dilution of the sterile saline solution then 10 mg mofs was added into a 20 ml bacteria solution 106 108 cfu ml 1 and irradiated by near infrared nir light a 300 w xe lamp coupled with an ir light filter λ 700 nm for 60 min at the density of 2000 w m 2 or simulated sunlight 300 w xe lamp coupled with an am 1 5g filter for 60 min at the density of 1000 w m 2 the bacteria solution 0 5 ml was carefully removed at scheduled intervals and their concentrations were determined by standard plate counting the agar plates were incubated at 37 c for 20 h to count the number of colonies a series of dark control experiments were performed in the dark environment under the same conditions as the above photocatalytic experiment the blank control group was carried out under nir light or simulated sunlight in the absence of photocatalysts all the bactericidal experiments were conducted in triplicate the sterilization efficiency against e coli over m zn zifs can be calculated by 1 sterilization efficiency lo g 10 c 0 lo g 10 c t where c0 cfu ml 1 is the initial bacterial concentration and ct cfu ml 1 is the bacterial concentration at a certain time interval 2 5 2 antibacterial activity of zn2 co2 ni2 cu2 the antibacterial activity of zn2 co2 ni2 and cu2 was measured by the minimum inhibitory concentration mic method respectively in the mic text a series of solutions with different concentrations of zn no3 2 6h2o cu no3 2 3h2o co no3 2 6h2o or ni no3 2 6h2o were prepared by a two fold serial dilution method consecutively 20 μl of bacteria cells 106 cfu ml 1 was added in the serial solutions containing zn2 co2 ni2 or cu2 then the

experiments were determined by the standard plate count spc method 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization of m zn zifs m co ni cu a series m zn zifs m co ni cu with different doping concentrations were synthesized via the expeditious room temperature stirring method using bimetallic ions zn2 and m2 and 2 meim ligands fig 1 a the successful introduction of co2 ni2 cu2 into the frameworks of zif 8 is confirmed by icp oes and the color change of the synthesized materials fig 1b table s1 and fig s1 remarkably the icp oes results show that the average molar ratios of co to zn in co zn zifs are similar to their feeding molar ratios while those of ni cu to zn in the ni zn zifs or cu zn zifs are far lower than their feeding molar ratios indicating that co2 can replace zn ii of any proportion in zif 8 which cannot be achieved by ni2 and cu2 this may be caused by the similarity of the characteristics between doped metal ions ion radius electronegativity coordination etc and zn ii nodes in zif 8 devi et al 2010 madrid et al 2020 horsfall and spiff 2005 uppara et al 2020 mahdi et al 2018 schejn et al 2015 the ion radii and electronegativities of zn2 co2 ni2 and cu2 are summarized in table s2 co2 ni2 cu2 has the same charge as zn2 and a similar radius and close atomic number to it leading to a high chance for co ii ni ii cu ii to substitute for zn ii in zif 8 without altering its topology devi et al 2010 horsfall and spiff 2005 schejn et al 2015 figs s2a and s2b illustrate that zif 8 has a sodalite sod zeolite type structure consisting of four coordinated zn ii and 2 meim ligands in a tetrahedral geometry and zif 67 with the co n coordination exhibits almost identical crystal structure to zif 8 with the zn n coordination park et al 2006 banerjee et al 2008 unlike zn2 and co2 which almost always form a four coordinated tetrahedral geometric configuration with n ni2 can also form a six coordinated octahedral geometric configuration with n and cu2 can also form a four coordinated planar quadrilateral geometric configuration with n li et al 2014 wang et al 2021b which is demonstrated by the crystal topology structures of several other cu n or ni n coordinated mofs fig s2c and s2d ding et al 2005 feng et al 2018 hence cu2 ni2 is not easy to be introduced into the zn ii node of zif 8 at a high concentration while co2 can be introduced into the zn ii node in an arbitrary concentration without altering the topology of zif 8 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure the powder x ray diffraction pxrd patterns of all synthesized m zn zifs are consistent with that of pristine zif 8 and the simulated pattern of a zif 8 single crystal ccdc 602542 suggesting that the introduction of co2 ni2 cu2 into the zn ii node of these zifs does not disturb the crystallinity of zif 8 fig 1c and fig s3 park et al 2006 co2 ni2 and cu2 may compete with zn2 to form bonds in a coordinated manner the possible crystal structures of co zn zifs ni zn zifs and cu zn zifs are shown in fig 1a sem images of samples indicate that m zn zifs nanocrystals retained the same feature classic rhombic dodecahedron as zif 8 fig 1d f and figs s4 7 interestingly it is observed that the positive correlation between the co cu doping concentration and the crystal size of the zifs while the negative correlation between the ni doping concentration and the crystal size of the zifs this may be related to the change of the crystal growth rate caused by metal ions doping saliba et al 2018 eds mapping of co1zn19 zif cu1zn9 9 zif and ni1zn9 zif reveals that co2 cu2 ni2 are uniformly doped into the mofs fig 1g i the surface chemical bonding properties of all samples were tested by xps zn ii in all m zn zifs has an oxidation state of 2 and the doped ions co and cu ions mainly exist in the material with a valence state of 2 fig s8 as shown in fig 2 significant changes in the chemical shift associated with substitution of ni2 were found for n 1s and zn 2p while tiny change in chemical shift associated with substitution of cu2 or co2 was found for n 1s and zn 2p interestingly the peaks of n 1s and zn 2p for ni zn zifs shift towards the higher binding energy with the increase in the ni doping concentration as compared to those of zif 8 these shifts indicate that the electrons may transfer from n in the ligand to zn ii nodes or from ni ii nodes to n in the ligand the partial sharing of the positive charges between metal nodes and ligands as well as the delocalization of δ electron may cause changes in the chelation antimicrobial properties of materials pawar et al 2012 salam et al 2018 in addition these results also indicate that the ni2 ions are doped into the metal nodes of zif 8 rather than simply being adsorbed 3 2 light harvesting photo response and photothermal effect of m zn zifs m co ni cu the light harvesting ability photo response ability photo generated electron transport ability and photothermal conversion efficiency of catalysts are closely related to their efficiency for photo disinfection wang et al 2019 yu et al 2021 the doping of foreign metal ions into the zn ii node of zif 8 may introduce new electronic levels into the band of zif 8 to form interband trap sites which is beneficial to broaden their light absorption ranges and decrease the electron hole recombination chen et al 2020 xiao and jiang 2019 li et al 2019a sun et al 2013 thanh et al 2017 the doping also may introduce the intrinsic d d transitions trigger by the doped metal ions under light irradiation which result in their enhanced photothermal conversion efficiencies han et al 2020 zou et al 2021 therefore we systematically characterized these properties of these synthesized materials the light harvesting ability of zif 8 co zn zifs cu zn zifs and ni zn zifs was measured by their uv vis near ir absorption spectra fig 3 a d and fig s9a compared with zif 8 which only exhibits the ultraviolet response 420 nm co zn zifs cu zn zifs and ni zn zifs all have broad absorption across the ultraviolet 420 nm visible 420 800 nm and near infrared 800 1200 nm spectral regions reflecting their enhanced light harvesting ability the ultraviolet absorption could be responsible for the intra ligand charge transfer and the lmct compared with zif 8 co zn zifs cu zn zifs and ni zn zifs all show obvious red shifts in the absorption edge associated with the lmct and the absorption edge redshift degrees are in the order of ni zn zifs cu zn zifs co zn zifs the results indicate that the introduction of light absorbing metal ions co2 ni2 or cu2 into the metal nodes of zifs broadens the light utilization range of the material and ni2 doping has the most obvious effect on widening the absorption range fig 3d the visible and near infrared absorption of m zn zifs could be attributed to the introduction of the higher lying 4a2 f 4t1 p and lower lying 4a2 f 4t1 f d d ligand field transitions of light absorbing metal ions co2 ni2 or cu2 into m zn zifs zou et al 2021 xu et al 2019 the higher the doping concentration the more obvious the red shift of the absorption edge the higher the intensity of the visible and infrared absorption fig 3a c this result not only confirms that the light harvesting ability increases with the increase in the doping amount but also proves that the metal ions are doped into the metal nodes of zif 8 rather than simply being adsorbed the widening of the light absorption range of all m zn zifs may not only improve the light utilization efficiency but also may affect their photothermal conversion efficiency the photo response and the separation and charge transfer efficiency of photo generated carriers electron hole pairs of zif 8 and m zn zifs were compared by the photocurrent fig 3e h and the eis results fig s9 and s10 compared with zif 8 co zn zifs cu zn zifs and ni zn zifs all exhibit the enhanced photocurrent response and reduced charge transfer resistance under simulate sunlight irradiation which demonstrates that the radiative electron hole recombination can be effectively suppressed by the rapid electron transfer due to an optimized charge transfer mode li et al 2021 xu et al 2019 zn2 is a redox inert metal node while co2 cu2 ni2 are relatively redox active metal nodes the conductivity of the open shell metal nodes in zifs co2 3d7 ni2 3d8 cu2 3d9 are higher than that of the closed shell zn2 3d10 node hu et al 2021 take co zn zifs as an example for a low concentration of co2 doping on the zif 8 the excited charge separated ecs state mainly depends on zn zn communication and the introduction of open shell co2 on the zif 8 results in the mmct which also contributes to the long lived states pattengale et al 2016 the enhancement of their photo response and the separation and transfer efficiency may play a key role in the improvement of photo disinfection efficiency the photothermal conversion efficiency of samples were evaluated through the photos taken by an infrared camera the temperature evolutions as a function of time over zif 8 co zn zifs ni zn zifs and cu zn zifs during simulated sunlight irradiation are shown in fig 4 a c and fig s11 the materials heated up sharply in the first minute under simulated solar radiation and then leveled off fig s11 indicating that all materials exhibit the photothermal effect and the rate of photothermal conversion is fast the photothermal effect of zifs can be tuned by adjusting the type and concentration of doped metal ions which may be probably due to their own infrared absorption capacity as presented in fig 4d with the same doping amount of foreign metal the influences of metal ion species on the rate of the photo induced temperature rise over all samples are in the order of cu zn zifs co zn zifs ni zn zifs zif 8 for the same type of m zn zifs the photothermal effect enhances with the increase in the concentration of metal ions however the actual doping amount of cu2 ni2 is low co2 can replace zn ii in any proportion without altering the topology of zif 8 and the actual co2 doping amount can reach 100 among all samples the rate of the photo induced temperature rise within the first minute of irradiation of co1zn1 zif with co2 doping concentration of 55 5 is the highest which reaches 50 c min 1 this result also perfectly matched the light absorption intensity of each sample in their near infrared region hence the photothermal effect is readily regulated by changing the type and concentration of doped metal ions in the zifs which play a dominant role in the rate of photo induced temperature rise of zifs the enhancement of photothermal conversion efficiency may also be beneficial to photo disinfection efficiency 3 3 bacterial inactivation efficiency and bacterial inactivation mechanisms over m zn zifs m zn zifs could inherit some features of zif 8 such as high chemical stability and n type semiconductor nature li et al 2019b the above experimental results prove that the light harvesting photo response charge transfer and photothermal effect of m zn zifs can be improved to by various degrees by doping metal ions co2 ni2 or cu2 into the zn ii nodes among samples with low metal ion doping concentrations molar ratio of m2 zn2 0 1 co1zn19 zif ni1zn9 zif and cu1zn99 zif showed similar photocurrent responses we selected these three m zn zifs to further explore their photocatalytic antibacterial activity and the photothermal sterilization mechanisms the photo sterilization experiments were carried out in 0 9 w v saline with a mofs dosage concentration of 500 mg l 1 and the initial e coli cell density of 106 cfu ml 1 as shown in fig 5 a b among these m zn zifs co1zn19 zif shows the best inactivation efficiency of 6 6 log10 cfu ml 1 against e coli after 60 min of simulate sunlight irradiation a 300 w xe lamp coupled with an am 1 5 filter at 1000 w cm 2 cu1zn99 zif shows better inactivation efficiency of 5 9 log10 cfu ml 1 than zif 8 4 2 log10 cfu ml 1 while ni1zn9 zif shows similar inactivation efficiency of 4 2 log10 cfu ml 1 to zif 8 the photo sterilization performance of the co1zn19 zif nanoparticles is benchmarked to commercial tio2 nanoparticles with an average particle size of 150 nm the inactivation rate of e coli was just 0 11 log in commercial tio2 photocatalytic disinfection which was much lower than 6 6 log inactivation of e coli over co1zn19 zif fig s12 thus the photo sterilization effect of co1zn19 zif was better than commercial that of tio2 for e coli disinfection under simulate sunlight irradiation which was also consistent with the literature cho et al 2005 moreover table s3 summarized the photo sterilization performance comparison between co1zn19 zif with the literature values of other known photocatalysts cho et al 2005 zheng et al 2018 yadav et al 2016 lan et al 2007 tian et al 2019 liu et al 2016 torres et al 2010 xiong et al 2017 thurston et al 2016 the co1zn19 zif showed better photo sterilization performance than many known semiconductor photocatalysts which represents that co1zn19 zif is a promising photocatalyst for photo disinfection unlike the almost complete inactivation against e coli over co1zn19 zif light alone and m zn zifs co1zn19 zif ni1zn9 zif cu1zn99 zif in dark all exhibit negligible sterilization efficiency under the same conditions fig s13 and fig 5c which are about 0 08 0 29 0 81 and 0 52 log10 cfu ml 1 respectively it is worth noting that although the sterilization efficiency of ni1zn9 zif is not improved compared with that of zif 8 under simulate sunlight irradiation it is significantly improved compared with that of zif 8 in dark 0 28 log10 cfu ml 1 this may be due to the enhanced chelation antimicrobial effect of ni1zn9 zif by the changed compatibility of ni ii zn ii nodes in mofs and bacterial cells membranes li et al 2021 salam et al 2018 control experiments under different temperature conditions revealed that the sterilization efficiency can reach 6 log10 cfu ml 1 when the water temperature is above 60 c fig 5d this finding motivated us to investigate the effect of photothermal effect of zifs on photo sterilization efficiency fig 5e f co1zn19 zif and cu1zn9 zif which exhibit the similar photothermal temperature after ten minute irradiation 58 3 and 64 9 c min 1 were selected to compare their photocatalytic antibacterial activity in nir light irradiation a 300 w xe lamp coupled with an ir light filter λ 750 nm at 1000 w cm 2 the control experiments shows that the inactivation efficiency against e coli 106 cfu ml 1 after 60 min of nir light irradiation alone was about 0 47 log10 cfu ml 1 indicating that the nir light irradiation alone exhibits a negligible antibacterial effect in the absence of mof photocatalysts and e coli thrives fig s14 as expected the inactivation efficiency against e coli over cu1zn9 zif 2 21 log10 cfu ml 1 after 60 min of nir light irradiation was similar with that of co1zn19 zif 1 65 log10 cfu ml 1 and they both showed higher inactivation efficiency than pristine zif 8 0 21 log10 cfu ml 1 under the same condition fig 5e this result confirms that the excellent photothermal effect of m zn zifs is the essential factor for photo sterilization the morphology changes of e coli cell membranes observed by afm further revealed the key role of photothermal in sterilization over co zn zifs as shown in fig 6 the bacterial cells show the well preserved morphology with smooth surface before irradiation fig 6a b and the rough and curled morphology after irradiation under simulate sunlight irradiation for 1 h fig 6c f however contrary to the expectation cu1zn9 zif with a slightly higher photo induced temperature rise showed lower inactivation efficiency 4 2 log10 cfu ml 1 than co1zn19 zif 6 6 log10 cfu ml 1 fig 5f compared with ni1zn9 zif 4 2 log10 cfu ml 1 cu1zn99 zif shows a similar photo induced temperature rise about 2 c min 1 but higher inactivation efficiency 5 9 log10 cfu ml 1 it is inferred that photothermal effect of m zn zifs is a necessary but not sufficient condition for photo sterilization other effect should be investigated to reveal the complete reason for the excellent photo sterilization performance over m zn zifs m cu co prior to this it is necessary to consider the influence of the released metal ions from mofs during the light irradiation process on the sterilization effect the release of high concentrations of intrinsically bactericidal cations such as cu2 and co2 through the decomposition of their frameworks is a common reason for most mofs to fulfill their antibacterial task aguado et al 2014 jo et al 2019 to clarify the effect of released metal ions on bactericidal performance the concentrations of leached metal ions of various materials were measured by icp oes fig s15 as well as the mic of each metal ion zn2 co2 ni2 cu2 were tested by a two fold serial dilution method fig s16 the result reveals that metal ion leaching in a trace amount is not sufficient to show a toxic effect on e coli under experimental conditions the introduction of light absorbing metal ions co2 ni2 or cu2 into the metal nodes of mofs contributes a broaden light absorption region which may directly affect the photo disinfection efficiency han et al 2020 zou et al 2021 wang et al 2019 yu et al 2021 compared with zif 8 centered at 292 nm co1zn19 zif ni1zn9 zif and cu1zn99 zif all show strong redshifted absorption centered at 296 341 and 327 nm respectively that are responsible for the lmct however the ni1zn9 zif with the largest red shift did not exhibit the highest photo disinfection activity indicating that widening of the light absorption region by a small extent does not significantly affect the photo disinfection activity figs 3d and 7 a the energy levels for the m zn zifs fig 7d were calculated based on the tauc plots fig 7a and m s results fig 7b to estimate if their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo potentials with negative values are sufficiently large to generate multiple ros such as singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide o2 hydroxyl radical oh and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to destroy bacterial cell membrane in the photocatalytic sterilization reaction nosaka and nosaka 2017 all materials are n type semiconductor nature determined from m s plots and the calculated flat band positions lumo potentials of zif 8 co1zn19 zif ni1zn9 zif and cu1zn99 zif are 0 83 1 24 0 95 and 0 93 v vs the normal hydrogen electrode nhe ph 6 8 respectively which are all sufficiently negative for the photocatalytic sterilization reaction fig 7d all calculated valence band potentials the highest occupied molecular orbital homo potentials were proven by the vb xps fig 7c as presented in fig 8 a d the ros quenching experiments confirmed that the photo generated electrons 1o2 and h2o2 in the simulate sunlight irradiation process played an important role in photocatalytic sterilization the electron paramagnetic resonance epr results indicated that the metal ion doping in zifs influenced the type and yield of photo generated ros fig 8e l after the irradiation with simulate sunlight the three characteristic peaks of the temp 1o2 were detected in the four aqueous solutions containing co1zn19 zif cu1zn99 zif ni1zn9 zif or zif 8 and the peaks intensity increases with the irradiation time fig 8e h the intensity of temp 1o2 and the photo sterilization activity were not well matched cu1zn99 zif showed the highest intensity of temp 1o2 while its photo sterilization activity was lower than that of co1zn19 zif interestingly the characteristic peaks of the dmpo o2 were detected only in the methanol solution containing co1zn19 zif fig 8i l co1zn19 zif showed multiple types of photo generated ros 1o2 and o2 and highest photo sterilization activity indicating that multiple ros might contribute significantly to the photo sterilization activity in order to further improve the efficiency of photo sterilization co zn zifs co1zn19 zif co1zn3 zif co1zn1 zif and zif 67 that exhibited higher photothermal conversion efficiency than co1zn19 zif were selected to investigate their bactericidal mechanism under simulate sunlight irradiation the sterilization efficiency over co zn zifs at an e coli cell density of 108 cfu ml 1 increased sharply at first and then decreased as the co2 doping concentration increased fig 9 a fig s17a all co zn zifs showed better photo sterilization performance than zif 8 1 75 log10 cfu ml 1 of which co1zn19 zif with a low co2 doping concentration was the best 3 76 log10 cfu ml 1 zif 67 showed lower photo sterilization efficiency 1 55 log10 cfu ml 1 than zif 8 the sterilization efficiency improved gradually with the increase in the co2 doping concentration in dark which are in the order of zif 67 1 78 log10 cfu ml 1 co1zn1 zif 0 545 log10 cfu ml 1 co1zn3 zif 0 265 log10 cfu ml 1 co1zn19 zif 0 229 log10 cfu ml 1 zif 8 0 229 log10 cfu ml 1 fig s17b there may be two reasons for the low photo sterilization efficiency of co zn zifs with high co2 doping concentration on the one hand for the high concentration of co2 doping on the zif 8 the ecs state mainly depend on co co communication and a small amount of redox inert zn2 could block the inherent ecs through co co communication while the zn co charge transfer could partially contribute to the ecs hu et al 2021 liu et al 2021 this hypothesis was further proven by the photo sterilization experiments of co zn zifs with a wide range of co2 doping concentrations as well as their photocurrent response and eis results fig s9b and s10d co1zn19 zif with the lowest photothermal conversion efficiency among all co zn zifs exhibited the highest photo sterilization efficiency inferring that the photo sterilization activity over co zn zifs with high co2 doping concentration may be more affected by their photocatalytic activity than their photothermal activity on the other hand it may be due to the partial or total collapse of their crystal structures as well as the cationic defects cause by its poor water stability zhou et al 2017 qian et al 2018 after irradiation of zif 8 zif 67 and these co zn zifs in 0 9 w v saline containing 108 cfu ml 1 e coli their water stability was evaluated by xrd and icp oes fig s17c d the results proved that although zn co zifs retain their crystal phase after the photo sterilization experiments while their crystallinity decreased with the doping concentration of co2 increases and zif 67 decomposed to nonporous cobalt complex fig s17c the concentration of the leached co2 increased gradually as the doping concentration of co2 increases which was consistent with the sterilization efficiency in dark and the changing trend of crystallinity indicating that water stability of materials may contribute significantly to the sterilization activity in dark fig s17d when the co2 doping ratio is 100 the concentration of leached co2 suddenly decreases but the sterilization activity in dark reaches upto 1 78 log10 cfu ml 1 which may be related to the re formed cobalt complex increased the contact with bacteria aguado et al 2014 notably the mic result of co2 confirmed that leached co2 showed negligible toxic effect on e coli fig s16 hence the significantly improved sterilization efficiency of zn co zifs in dark may be attribute to their enhanced chelation antimicrobial effects caused by a controlled increase in cationic defects with the increase of co2 leaching concentration as shown in fig 9b the trends in crystallinity of mofs and photo sterilization activity were remarkably consistent in an analysis of multiple factors inferring that the photocatalytic bactericidal activity may be greatly affected by the water stability of the mofs the opposite trends in the sterilization activity of the co zn zifs in dark and their crystallinity indicates that the cationic defects caused by the decreased crystallinity in co zn zifs with high concentration of co2 doping is beneficial to improving the sterilization performance of co zn zifs under non light conditions which provides insights into the development of new chelation antimicrobial agents as summarized in fig 10 the proposed antibacterial mechanisms of m zn zifs are as follows 1 the high crystal stability e g charge balance and water stability of metal ion doped mofs low concentration doping or non ni2 doping is the basis of their high photocatalytic bactericidal performance 2 on this basis the cu2 co2 doping is beneficial to improving the photothermal conversion efficiency of zifs thus contributing to the improved photo sterilization efficiency while the co2 doping is beneficial to the generation of multiple ros 1o2 and o2 thus contributing to the further improved photo sterilization efficiency 3 the low crystal stability e g charge balance and water stability of metal ion doped mofs high concentration doping or ni2 doping may change the compatibility between mofs and bacterial cell membranes thus improving the chelating bactericidal performance of the zifs in the absence of light 4 conclusions in summary the m zn zifs involving diverse metal ions and doping concentrations have been synthesized and exhibit distinct photocatalytic and photothermal effects the regulation of which on the photo sterilization effect has been systematically investigated among the m zn zifs with low metal ion doping concentrations co1zn19 zif and cu1zn99 zif exhibit a satisfactory photo sterilization effect against e coli under simulated sunlight irradiation because of the synergy of the photocatalysis and photothermal effects co1zn19 zif in particular exhibits higher bactericidal efficiency due to the production of multiple ros among the zifs with low crystal stability the co zn zifs with high metal ion doping concentrations and ni1zn9 zif show optimized chelation antimicrobial performance against e coli in dark due to the δ electron delocalization caused by the tunable cationic co ii defects or the weak electron pulling strength of the ni ii nodes respectively this work provides insights into the regulation of metal ion doping in mofs to achieve desired photo sterilization and dark sterilization effects thereby contributing to the expanded application of mofs however powder samples still have the problems of rapid heat dissipation which is difficult to meet the needs of practical applications due to their concentrated elevated temperature zone catalyst coated membranes may play a better role in the photothermal characteristics of than powder catalysts nyamutswa et al 2020 catalyst coated membranes should be further studied to expand the

15214,photocatalytic and photothermal disinfection is a promising strategy for addressing the challenges of environmental microbial contamination in this work we choose a metal organic framework mof zif 8 as an inexpensive and ideal model for metal ion doping and manipulate the band structure thermal vibration in molecules charge distribution and robustness of the metal ligand coordination bond of the metal ion doped zifs for their use in photo disinfection the effects of their absorption edge rate of the photo induced temperature rise transient photocurrent response photo generated reactive oxygen species ros type and crystal stability on the photo disinfection performance are systematically studied by varying the metal ion type co2 ni2 or cu2 and doping concentration 1 100 the results show that the efficiency of light harvesting and photogenerated carrier separation is facilitated in all doped zifs the photothermal conversion gradually improves with the increasing concentration of doped co2 cu2 remarkably the photo generated ros type changes from the original singlet oxygen 1o2 to multiple ros 1o2 and o2 due to the introduction of co ii sites consequently compared with pristine zif 8 and other doped zifs co2 doped zif 8 with a 5 doping concentration shows the highest sterilization efficiency 6 6 log10 cfu ml 1 against escherichia coli e coli under simulated sunlight within one hour by virtue of the enhanced photothermal effect and the generation of multiple ros this work provides insights into the application of metal ion doped mof photocatalysts to the disinfection of

pathogenic bacteria e g gram negative and gram positive bacteria etc has become a serious and ever increasing global problem particularly in water security wang et al 2018 tang et al 2020 in such a situation various water disinfection techniques such as chlorination ultraviolet irradiation ozonation nanofiltration and electrolysis have been developed to address this problem wei et al 2022 backer et al 2019 wang et al 2021a as some of these techniques inevitably have disadvantages such as low efficiency long residence time high cost easy recolonization and secondary pollution researchers are turning their attention to the use of photo sterilization as an environmentally friendly low cost and effective alternative zhang et al 2020a 2020b li et al 2021 for decades various functional materials such as tio2 wo3 mos2 metal organic frameworks mofs covalent organic frameworks cofs and graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 have been widely used to develop the promising photo sterilization technique li et al 2021 liu et al 2016 esrafili et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 ren et al 2018 among these reported materials mofs with abundant accessible active sites and tunable inorganic and organic components have attracted rising attention in the past few years and are considered as the most promising candidate for photo sterilization pettinari et al 2021 some pristine mof materials such as mil 100 fe zif 8 zif 11 hn2 mil 125 hn2 uio 66 hf tcpp bit 66 and pcn 224 have been reported to have high photocatalytic bactericidal activity deng et al 2019 ma et al 2020 chen et al 2020 li et al 2019a however due to the limitations of their inherent characteristics such as the large band gap and single ligand to metal charge transfer lmct mode pristine mofs exhibited the low ability to harvest light and separate photon generated electron hole making it difficult to further reduce the cost shorten time and enhance efficiency in water sterilization li et al 2021 pettinari et al 2021 deng et al 2019 ma et al 2020 chen et al 2020 furthermore the contribution of the photothermal effect in photo sterilization cannot be ignored zhang et al 2020b yougbare et al 2020 many mof materials have shown the satisfactory photothermal conversion capability but have not been applied in this field song et al 2022 xiao and jiang 2019 hence the coordination between the photocatalytic activities and the photothermal effects is the key to improving the photo sterilization efficiency of mofs metal ion doping in the metal nodes of mofs has been proved to be a perfect strategy to achieve this objective it can bring a number of advantages 1 the band structures of mofs can be adjusted and thus their light absorption ranges are broadened chen et al 2020 xiao and jiang 2019 li et al 2019b sun et al 2013 thanh et al 2017 chen et al reported the partial substitution of the zirconium zr ions by titanium ti ions into the clusters of pcn 224 to extend its light response in the visible region and cause more efficient reactive oxygen species ros generation resulting in the enhanced antibacterial activity against mdr gram positive negative pathogens chen et al 2020 li et al revealed that the mechanism of the photothermal enhancement of zinc doped prussian blue was the band gap narrowing effect and the redshifted localized surface plasmon resonance lspr caused by zinc ions doping li et al 2019b 2 the intrinsic d d transitions can be triggered by the doped metal ions e g co2 and cu2 under near infrared irradiation resulting in the introduction of an additional light energy conversion photothermal conversion module xiao and jiang 2019 han et al 2020 zou et al 2021 han et al confirmed that introducing cu2 into the porphyrin ligands of pcn 224 enhanced its photocatalytic activity and photothermal effect in the sterilization process han et al 2020 3 new metal to metal charge transfer mmct modes are introduced to promote the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron hole pairs li et al 2021 xu et al 2019 4 metal ion doping has also been shown to improve the water stability of some mofs zhou et al 2017 although the effects of these advantages on the photocatalytic performances of mofs have been investigated separately the improvement in the photo sterilization performance has not been studied in detail sun et al 2013 thanh et al 2017 zou et al 2021 xu et al 2019 zhou et al 2017 therefore it is still necessary to develop new metal ion doped mof antibacterial materials with simple synthesis process low cost high stability and excellent bactericidal performance and systematically explore the relationship between the type and concentration of doped metal ions and the performance and mechanism photocatalytic activity and selectivity photothermal effect in water sterilization herein we choose the cheap and easy to synthesize zif 8 with high photocatalytic bactericidal performance to act as an ideal model for metal ion doping and introduce the light absorbing metal ions co2 ni2 or cu2 into the metal nodes of zif 8 to obtain a series of metal ions doped zif 8 denoted as m x zn y zif m co ni cu where x and y represented the different feeding molar ratio between m2 and zn2 with different doping concentrations furthermore their photocatalytic activity and selectivity photothermal effects and crystal stability in sterilization are systematically investigated this work provides insights into the photo sterilization of mofs doped with different metal ions and doping concentrations which have important implications for the

sterile saline solution 0 9 w v the concentration of bacteria used in the bactericidal experiments was adjusted to 106 cfu ml 1 by gradient dilution of the sterile saline solution then 10 mg mofs was added into a 20 ml bacteria solution 106 108 cfu ml 1 and irradiated by near infrared nir light a 300 w xe lamp coupled with an ir light filter λ 700 nm for 60 min at the density of 2000 w m 2 or simulated sunlight 300 w xe lamp coupled with an am 1 5g filter for 60 min at the density of 1000 w m 2 the bacteria solution 0 5 ml was carefully removed at scheduled intervals and their concentrations were determined by standard plate counting the agar plates were incubated at 37 c for 20 h to count the number of colonies a series of dark control experiments were performed in the dark environment under the same conditions as the above photocatalytic experiment the blank control group was carried out under nir light or simulated sunlight in the absence of photocatalysts all the bactericidal experiments were conducted in triplicate the sterilization efficiency against e coli over m zn zifs can be calculated by 1 sterilization efficiency lo g 10 c 0 lo g 10 c t where c0 cfu ml 1 is the initial bacterial concentration and ct cfu ml 1 is the bacterial concentration at a certain time interval 2 5 2 antibacterial activity of zn2 co2 ni2 cu2 the antibacterial activity of zn2 co2 ni2 and cu2 was measured by the minimum inhibitory concentration mic method respectively in the mic text a series of solutions with different concentrations of zn no3 2 6h2o cu no3 2 3h2o co no3 2 6h2o or ni no3 2 6h2o were prepared by a two fold serial dilution method consecutively 20 μl of bacteria cells 106 cfu ml 1 was added in the serial solutions containing zn2 co2 ni2 or cu2 then the bacteria were incubated at 37 c for 20 h to observe the turbidity and the mic of each metal ion was determined by the turbidimetric method 2 5 3 scavenger quenching experiments scavenger quenching

experiments were determined by the standard plate count spc method 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization of m zn zifs m co ni cu a series m zn zifs m co ni cu with different doping concentrations were synthesized via the expeditious room temperature stirring method using bimetallic ions zn2 and m2 and 2 meim ligands fig 1 a the successful introduction of co2 ni2 cu2 into the frameworks of zif 8 is confirmed by icp oes and the color change of the synthesized materials fig 1b table s1 and fig s1 remarkably the icp oes results show that the average molar ratios of co to zn in co zn zifs are similar to their feeding molar ratios while those of ni cu to zn in the ni zn zifs or cu zn zifs are far lower than their feeding molar ratios indicating that co2 can replace zn ii of any proportion in zif 8 which cannot be achieved by ni2 and cu2 this may be caused by the similarity of the characteristics between doped metal ions ion radius electronegativity coordination etc and zn ii nodes in zif 8 devi et al 2010 madrid et al 2020 horsfall and spiff 2005 uppara et al 2020 mahdi et al 2018 schejn et al 2015 the ion radii and electronegativities of zn2 co2 ni2 and cu2 are summarized in table s2 co2 ni2 cu2 has the same charge as zn2 and a similar radius and close atomic number to it leading to a high chance for co ii ni ii cu ii to substitute for zn ii in zif 8 without altering its topology devi et al 2010 horsfall and spiff 2005 schejn et al 2015 figs s2a and s2b illustrate that zif 8 has a sodalite sod zeolite type structure consisting of four coordinated zn ii and 2 meim ligands in a tetrahedral geometry and zif 67 with the co n coordination exhibits almost identical crystal structure to zif 8 with the zn n coordination park et al 2006 banerjee et al 2008 unlike zn2 and co2 which almost always form a four coordinated tetrahedral geometric configuration with n ni2 can also form a six coordinated octahedral geometric configuration with n and cu2 can also form a four coordinated planar quadrilateral geometric configuration with n li et al 2014 wang et al 2021b which is demonstrated by the crystal topology structures of several other cu n or ni n coordinated mofs fig s2c and s2d ding et al 2005 feng et al 2018 hence cu2 ni2 is not easy to be introduced into the zn ii node of zif 8 at a high concentration while co2 can be introduced into the zn ii node in an arbitrary concentration without altering the topology of zif 8 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure the powder x ray diffraction pxrd patterns of all synthesized m zn zifs are consistent with that of pristine zif 8 and the simulated pattern of a zif 8 single crystal ccdc 602542 suggesting that the introduction of co2 ni2 cu2 into the zn ii node of these zifs does not disturb the crystallinity of zif 8 fig 1c and fig s3 park et al 2006 co2 ni2 and cu2 may compete with zn2 to form bonds in a coordinated manner the possible crystal structures of co zn zifs ni zn zifs and cu zn zifs are shown in fig 1a sem images of samples indicate that m zn zifs nanocrystals retained the same feature classic rhombic dodecahedron as zif 8 fig 1d f and figs s4 7 interestingly it is observed that the positive correlation between the co cu doping concentration and the crystal size of the zifs while the negative correlation between the ni doping concentration and the crystal size of the zifs this may be related to the change of the crystal growth rate caused by metal ions doping saliba et al 2018 eds mapping of co1zn19 zif cu1zn9 9 zif and ni1zn9 zif reveals that co2 cu2 ni2 are uniformly doped into the mofs fig 1g i the surface chemical bonding properties of all samples were tested by xps zn ii in all m zn zifs has an oxidation state of 2 and the doped ions co and cu ions mainly exist in the material with a valence state of 2 fig s8 as shown in fig 2 significant changes in the chemical shift associated with substitution of ni2 were found for n 1s and zn 2p while tiny change in chemical shift associated with substitution of cu2 or co2 was found for n 1s and zn 2p interestingly the peaks of n 1s and zn 2p for ni zn zifs shift towards the higher binding energy with the increase in the ni doping concentration as compared to those of zif 8 these shifts indicate that the electrons may transfer from n in the ligand to zn ii nodes or from ni ii nodes to n in the ligand the partial sharing of the positive charges between metal nodes and ligands as well as the delocalization of δ electron may cause changes in the chelation antimicrobial properties of materials pawar et al 2012 salam et al 2018 in addition these results also indicate that the ni2 ions are doped into the metal nodes of zif 8 rather than simply being adsorbed 3 2 light harvesting photo response and photothermal effect of m zn zifs m co ni cu the light harvesting ability photo response ability photo generated electron transport ability and photothermal conversion efficiency of catalysts are closely related to their efficiency for photo disinfection wang et al 2019 yu et al 2021 the doping of foreign metal ions into the zn ii node of zif 8 may introduce new electronic levels into the band of zif 8 to form interband trap sites which is beneficial to broaden their light absorption ranges and decrease the electron hole recombination chen et al 2020 xiao and jiang 2019 li et al 2019a sun et al 2013 thanh et al 2017 the doping also may introduce the intrinsic d d transitions trigger by the doped metal ions under light irradiation which result in their enhanced photothermal conversion efficiencies han et al 2020 zou et al 2021 therefore we systematically characterized these properties of these synthesized materials the light harvesting ability of zif 8 co zn zifs cu zn zifs and ni zn zifs was measured by their uv vis near ir absorption spectra fig 3 a d and fig s9a compared with zif 8 which only exhibits the ultraviolet response 420 nm co zn zifs cu zn zifs and ni zn zifs all have broad absorption across the ultraviolet 420 nm visible 420 800 nm and near infrared 800 1200 nm spectral regions reflecting their enhanced light harvesting ability the ultraviolet absorption could be responsible for the intra ligand charge transfer and the lmct compared with zif 8 co zn zifs cu zn zifs and ni zn zifs all show obvious red shifts in the absorption edge associated with the lmct and the absorption edge redshift degrees are in the order of ni zn zifs cu zn zifs co zn zifs the results indicate that the introduction of light absorbing metal ions co2 ni2 or cu2 into the metal nodes of zifs broadens the light utilization range of the material and ni2 doping has the most obvious effect on widening the absorption range fig 3d the visible and near infrared absorption of m zn zifs could be attributed to the introduction of the higher lying 4a2 f 4t1 p and lower lying 4a2 f 4t1 f d d ligand field transitions of light absorbing metal ions co2 ni2 or cu2 into m zn zifs zou et al 2021 xu et al 2019 the higher the doping concentration the more obvious the red shift of the absorption edge the higher the intensity of the visible and infrared absorption fig 3a c this result not only confirms that the light harvesting ability increases with the increase in the doping amount but also proves that the metal ions are doped into the metal nodes of zif 8 rather than simply being adsorbed the widening of the light absorption range of all m zn zifs may not only improve the light utilization efficiency but also may affect their photothermal conversion efficiency the photo response and the separation and charge transfer efficiency of photo generated carriers electron hole pairs of zif 8 and m zn zifs were compared by the photocurrent fig 3e h and the eis results fig s9 and s10 compared with zif 8 co zn zifs cu zn zifs and ni zn zifs all exhibit the enhanced photocurrent response and reduced charge transfer resistance under simulate sunlight irradiation which demonstrates that the radiative electron hole recombination can be effectively suppressed by the rapid electron transfer due to an optimized charge transfer mode li et al 2021 xu et al 2019 zn2 is a redox inert metal node while co2 cu2 ni2 are relatively redox active metal nodes the conductivity of the open shell metal nodes in zifs co2 3d7 ni2 3d8 cu2 3d9 are higher than that of the closed shell zn2 3d10 node hu et al 2021 take co zn zifs as an example for a low concentration of co2 doping on the zif 8 the excited charge separated ecs state mainly depends on zn zn communication and the introduction of open shell co2 on the zif 8 results in the mmct which also contributes to the long lived states pattengale et al 2016 the enhancement of their photo response and the separation and transfer efficiency may play a key role in the improvement of photo disinfection efficiency the photothermal conversion efficiency of samples were evaluated through the photos taken by an infrared camera the temperature evolutions as a function of time over zif 8 co zn zifs ni zn zifs and cu zn zifs during simulated sunlight irradiation are shown in fig 4 a c and fig s11 the materials heated up sharply in the first minute under simulated solar radiation and then leveled off fig s11 indicating that all materials exhibit the photothermal effect and the rate of photothermal conversion is fast the photothermal effect of zifs can be tuned by adjusting the type and concentration of doped metal ions which may be probably due to their own infrared absorption capacity as presented in fig 4d with the same doping amount of foreign metal the influences of metal ion species on the rate of the photo induced temperature rise over all samples are in the order of cu zn zifs co zn zifs ni zn zifs zif 8 for the same type of m zn zifs the photothermal effect enhances with the increase in the concentration of metal ions however the actual doping amount of cu2 ni2 is low co2 can replace zn ii in any proportion without altering the topology of zif 8 and the actual co2 doping amount can reach 100 among all samples the rate of the photo induced temperature rise within the first minute of irradiation of co1zn1 zif with co2 doping concentration of 55 5 is the highest which reaches 50 c min 1 this result also perfectly matched the light absorption intensity of each sample in their near infrared region hence the photothermal effect is readily regulated by changing the type and concentration of doped metal ions in the zifs which play a dominant role in the rate of photo induced temperature rise of zifs the enhancement of photothermal conversion efficiency may also be beneficial to photo disinfection efficiency 3 3 bacterial inactivation efficiency and bacterial inactivation mechanisms over m zn zifs m zn zifs could inherit some features of zif 8 such as high chemical stability and n type semiconductor nature li et al 2019b the above experimental results prove that the light harvesting photo response charge transfer and photothermal effect of m zn zifs can be improved to by various degrees by doping metal ions co2 ni2 or cu2 into the zn ii nodes among samples with low metal ion doping concentrations molar ratio of m2 zn2 0 1 co1zn19 zif ni1zn9 zif and cu1zn99 zif showed similar photocurrent responses we selected these three m zn zifs to further explore their photocatalytic antibacterial activity and the photothermal sterilization mechanisms the photo sterilization experiments were carried out in 0 9 w v saline with a mofs dosage concentration of 500 mg l 1 and the initial e coli cell density of 106 cfu ml 1 as shown in fig 5 a b among these m zn zifs co1zn19 zif shows the best inactivation efficiency of 6 6 log10 cfu ml 1 against e coli after 60 min of simulate sunlight irradiation a 300 w xe lamp coupled with an am 1 5 filter at 1000 w cm 2 cu1zn99 zif shows better inactivation efficiency of 5 9 log10 cfu ml 1 than zif 8 4 2 log10 cfu ml 1 while ni1zn9 zif shows similar inactivation efficiency of 4 2 log10 cfu ml 1 to zif 8 the photo sterilization performance of the co1zn19 zif nanoparticles is benchmarked to commercial tio2 nanoparticles with an average particle size of 150 nm the inactivation rate of e coli was just 0 11 log in commercial tio2 photocatalytic disinfection which was much lower than 6 6 log inactivation of e coli over co1zn19 zif fig s12 thus the photo sterilization effect of co1zn19 zif was better than commercial that of tio2 for e coli disinfection under simulate sunlight irradiation which was also consistent with the literature cho et al 2005 moreover table s3 summarized the photo sterilization performance comparison between co1zn19 zif with the literature values of other known photocatalysts cho et al 2005 zheng et al 2018 yadav et al 2016 lan et al 2007 tian et al 2019 liu et al 2016 torres et al 2010 xiong et al 2017 thurston et al 2016 the co1zn19 zif showed better photo sterilization performance than many known semiconductor photocatalysts which represents that co1zn19 zif is a promising photocatalyst for photo disinfection unlike the almost complete inactivation against e coli over co1zn19 zif light alone and m zn zifs co1zn19 zif ni1zn9 zif cu1zn99 zif in dark all exhibit negligible sterilization efficiency under the same conditions fig s13 and fig 5c which are about 0 08 0 29 0 81 and 0 52 log10 cfu ml 1 respectively it is worth noting that although the sterilization efficiency of ni1zn9 zif is not improved compared with that of zif 8 under simulate sunlight irradiation it is significantly improved compared with that of zif 8 in dark 0 28 log10 cfu ml 1 this may be due to the enhanced chelation antimicrobial effect of ni1zn9 zif by the changed compatibility of ni ii zn ii nodes in mofs and bacterial cells membranes li et al 2021 salam et al 2018 control experiments under different temperature conditions revealed that the sterilization efficiency can reach 6 log10 cfu ml 1 when the water temperature is above 60 c fig 5d this finding motivated us to investigate the effect of photothermal effect of zifs on photo sterilization efficiency fig 5e f co1zn19 zif and cu1zn9 zif which exhibit the similar photothermal temperature after ten minute irradiation 58 3 and 64 9 c min 1 were selected to compare their photocatalytic antibacterial activity in nir light irradiation a 300 w xe lamp coupled with an ir light filter λ 750 nm at 1000 w cm 2 the control experiments shows that the inactivation efficiency against e coli 106 cfu ml 1 after 60 min of nir light irradiation alone was about 0 47 log10 cfu ml 1 indicating that the nir light irradiation alone exhibits a negligible antibacterial effect in the absence of mof photocatalysts and e coli thrives fig s14 as expected the inactivation efficiency against e coli over cu1zn9 zif 2 21 log10 cfu ml 1 after 60 min of nir light irradiation was similar with that of co1zn19 zif 1 65 log10 cfu ml 1 and they both showed higher inactivation efficiency than pristine zif 8 0 21 log10 cfu ml 1 under the same condition fig 5e this result confirms that the excellent photothermal effect of m zn zifs is the essential factor for photo sterilization the morphology changes of e coli cell membranes observed by afm further revealed the key role of photothermal in sterilization over co zn zifs as shown in fig 6 the bacterial cells show the well preserved morphology with smooth surface before irradiation fig 6a b and the rough and curled morphology after irradiation under simulate sunlight irradiation for 1 h fig 6c f however contrary to the expectation cu1zn9 zif with a slightly higher photo induced temperature rise showed lower inactivation efficiency 4 2 log10 cfu ml 1 than co1zn19 zif 6 6 log10 cfu ml 1 fig 5f compared with ni1zn9 zif 4 2 log10 cfu ml 1 cu1zn99 zif shows a similar photo induced temperature rise about 2 c min 1 but higher inactivation efficiency 5 9 log10 cfu ml 1 it is inferred that photothermal effect of m zn zifs is a necessary but not sufficient condition for photo sterilization other effect should be investigated to reveal the complete reason for the excellent photo sterilization performance over m zn zifs m cu co prior to this it is necessary to consider the influence of the released metal ions from mofs during the light irradiation process on the sterilization effect the release of high concentrations of intrinsically bactericidal cations such as cu2 and co2 through the decomposition of their frameworks is a common reason for most mofs to fulfill their antibacterial task aguado et al 2014 jo et al 2019 to clarify the effect of released metal ions on bactericidal performance the concentrations of leached metal ions of various materials were measured by icp oes fig s15 as well as the mic of each metal ion zn2 co2 ni2 cu2 were tested by a two fold serial dilution method fig s16 the result reveals that metal ion leaching in a trace amount is not sufficient to show a toxic effect on e coli under experimental conditions the introduction of light absorbing metal ions co2 ni2 or cu2 into the metal nodes of mofs contributes a broaden light absorption region which may directly affect the photo disinfection efficiency han et al 2020 zou et al 2021 wang et al 2019 yu et al 2021 compared with zif 8 centered at 292 nm co1zn19 zif ni1zn9 zif and cu1zn99 zif all show strong redshifted absorption centered at 296 341 and 327 nm respectively that are responsible for the lmct however the ni1zn9 zif with the largest red shift did not exhibit the highest photo disinfection activity indicating that widening of the light absorption region by a small extent does not significantly affect the photo disinfection activity figs 3d and 7 a the energy levels for the m zn zifs fig 7d were calculated based on the tauc plots fig 7a and m s results fig 7b to estimate if their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo potentials with negative values are sufficiently large to generate multiple ros such as singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide o2 hydroxyl radical oh and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to destroy bacterial cell membrane in the photocatalytic sterilization reaction nosaka and nosaka 2017 all materials are n type semiconductor nature determined from m s plots and the calculated flat band positions lumo potentials of zif 8 co1zn19 zif ni1zn9 zif and cu1zn99 zif are 0 83 1 24 0 95 and 0 93 v vs the normal hydrogen electrode nhe ph 6 8 respectively which are all sufficiently negative for the photocatalytic sterilization reaction fig 7d all calculated valence band potentials the highest occupied molecular orbital homo potentials were proven by the vb xps fig 7c as presented in fig 8 a d the ros quenching experiments confirmed that the photo generated electrons 1o2 and h2o2 in the simulate sunlight irradiation process played an important role in photocatalytic sterilization the electron paramagnetic resonance epr results indicated that the metal ion doping in zifs influenced the type and yield of photo generated ros fig 8e l after the irradiation with simulate sunlight the three characteristic peaks of the temp 1o2 were detected in the four aqueous solutions containing co1zn19 zif cu1zn99 zif ni1zn9 zif or zif 8 and the peaks intensity increases with the irradiation time fig 8e h the intensity of temp 1o2 and the photo sterilization activity were not well matched cu1zn99 zif showed the highest intensity of temp 1o2 while its photo sterilization activity was lower than that of co1zn19 zif interestingly the characteristic peaks of the dmpo o2 were detected only in the methanol solution containing co1zn19 zif fig 8i l co1zn19 zif showed multiple types of photo generated ros 1o2 and o2 and highest photo sterilization activity indicating that multiple ros might contribute significantly to the photo sterilization activity in order to further improve the efficiency of photo sterilization co zn zifs co1zn19 zif co1zn3 zif co1zn1 zif and zif 67 that exhibited higher photothermal conversion efficiency than co1zn19 zif were selected to investigate their bactericidal mechanism under simulate sunlight irradiation the sterilization efficiency over co zn zifs at an e coli cell density of 108 cfu ml 1 increased sharply at first and then decreased as the co2 doping concentration increased fig 9 a fig s17a all co zn zifs showed better photo sterilization performance than zif 8 1 75 log10 cfu ml 1 of which co1zn19 zif with a low co2 doping concentration was the best 3 76 log10 cfu ml 1 zif 67 showed lower photo sterilization efficiency 1 55 log10 cfu ml 1 than zif 8 the sterilization efficiency improved gradually with the increase in the co2 doping concentration in dark which are in the order of zif 67 1 78 log10 cfu ml 1 co1zn1 zif 0 545 log10 cfu ml 1 co1zn3 zif 0 265 log10 cfu ml 1 co1zn19 zif 0 229 log10 cfu ml 1 zif 8 0 229 log10 cfu ml 1 fig s17b there may be two reasons for the low photo sterilization efficiency of co zn zifs with high co2 doping concentration on the one hand for the high concentration of co2 doping on the zif 8 the ecs state mainly depend on co co communication and a small amount of redox inert zn2 could block the inherent ecs through co co communication while the zn co charge transfer could partially contribute to the ecs hu et al 2021 liu et al 2021 this hypothesis was further proven by the photo sterilization experiments of co zn zifs with a wide range of co2 doping concentrations as well as their photocurrent response and eis results fig s9b and s10d co1zn19 zif with the lowest photothermal conversion efficiency among all co zn zifs exhibited the highest photo sterilization efficiency inferring that the photo sterilization activity over co zn zifs with high co2 doping concentration may be more affected by their photocatalytic activity than their photothermal activity on the other hand it may be due to the partial or total collapse of their crystal structures as well as the cationic defects cause by its poor water stability zhou et al 2017 qian et al 2018 after irradiation of zif 8 zif 67 and these co zn zifs in 0 9 w v saline containing 108 cfu ml 1 e coli their water stability was evaluated by xrd and icp oes fig s17c d the results proved that although zn co zifs retain their crystal phase after the photo sterilization experiments while their crystallinity decreased with the doping concentration of co2 increases and zif 67 decomposed to nonporous cobalt complex fig s17c the concentration of the leached co2 increased gradually as the doping concentration of co2 increases which was consistent with the sterilization efficiency in dark and the changing trend of crystallinity indicating that water stability of materials may contribute significantly to the sterilization activity in dark fig s17d when the co2 doping ratio is 100 the concentration of leached co2 suddenly decreases but the sterilization activity in dark reaches upto 1 78 log10 cfu ml 1 which may be related to the re formed cobalt complex increased the contact with bacteria aguado et al 2014 notably the mic result of co2 confirmed that leached co2 showed negligible toxic effect on e coli fig s16 hence the significantly improved sterilization efficiency of zn co zifs in dark may be attribute to their enhanced chelation antimicrobial effects caused by a controlled increase in cationic defects with the increase of co2 leaching concentration as shown in fig 9b the trends in crystallinity of mofs and photo sterilization activity were remarkably consistent in an analysis of multiple factors inferring that the photocatalytic bactericidal activity may be greatly affected by the water stability of the mofs the opposite trends in the sterilization activity of the co zn zifs in dark and their crystallinity indicates that the cationic defects caused by the decreased crystallinity in co zn zifs with high concentration of co2 doping is beneficial to improving the sterilization performance of co zn zifs under non light conditions which provides insights into the development of new chelation antimicrobial agents as summarized in fig 10 the proposed antibacterial mechanisms of m zn zifs are as follows 1 the high crystal stability e g charge balance and water stability of metal ion doped mofs low concentration doping or non ni2 doping is the basis of their high photocatalytic bactericidal performance 2 on this basis the cu2 co2 doping is beneficial to improving the photothermal conversion efficiency of zifs thus contributing to the improved photo sterilization efficiency while the co2 doping is beneficial to the generation of multiple ros 1o2 and o2 thus contributing to the further improved photo sterilization efficiency 3 the low crystal stability e g charge balance and water stability of metal ion doped mofs high concentration doping or ni2 doping may change the compatibility between mofs and bacterial cell membranes thus improving the chelating bactericidal performance of the zifs in the absence of light 4 conclusions in summary the m zn zifs involving diverse metal ions and doping concentrations have been synthesized and exhibit distinct photocatalytic and photothermal effects the regulation of which on the photo sterilization effect has been systematically investigated among the m zn zifs with low metal ion doping concentrations co1zn19 zif and cu1zn99 zif exhibit a satisfactory photo sterilization effect against e coli under simulated sunlight irradiation because of the synergy of the photocatalysis and photothermal effects co1zn19 zif in particular exhibits higher bactericidal efficiency due to the production of multiple ros among the zifs with low crystal stability the co zn zifs with high metal ion doping concentrations and ni1zn9 zif show optimized chelation antimicrobial performance against e coli in dark due to the δ electron delocalization caused by the tunable cationic co ii defects or the weak electron pulling strength of the ni ii nodes respectively this work provides insights into the regulation of metal ion doping in mofs to achieve desired photo sterilization and dark sterilization effects thereby contributing to the expanded application of mofs however powder samples still have the problems of rapid heat dissipation which is difficult to meet the needs of practical applications due to their concentrated elevated temperature zone catalyst coated membranes may play a better role in the photothermal characteristics of than powder catalysts nyamutswa et al 2020 catalyst coated membranes should be further studied to expand the photo disinfection application of metal ion doped mofs supporting information supplementary material associated with this article can be found in the online version at doi declaration of competing
