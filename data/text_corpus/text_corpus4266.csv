21330,with the implementation of an energy efficiency design index energy saving devices esds have received increasing research interest in this study experimental and numerical analyses were performed on a 25 m long ore carrier model to investigate the working mechanism of esds comprising a pre swirl stator and a rudder bulb the interactions between the hull propeller rudder and esds were observed to have a positive effect on the propulsion performance of the large scale ship model to elucidate the effects self propulsion tests were conducted at sea to determine the thrust and torque coefficients the sliding mesh method was used to perform numerical simulations of the large scale ship model for unsteady multiphase flows with different inflow speeds the wake field at the stern and the pressure distribution on the vessel surface were analysed to investigate the energy saving mechanism the results showed that esds can effectively ameliorate the propeller slipstream and have a positive interference effect on the large scale hull the average gain of the esds relative to no esds was up to 3 keywords large scale pre swirl stator rudder bulb propulsion performance computational fluid dynamics cfd experimental fluid dynamics efd 1 introduction increased global awareness of the environment and restrictions on acceptable ship emissions have resulted in more attention on the reduction of the energy consumption of ships one of the simplest and most effective methods for improving the fuel efficiency and reducing emissions is to improve the propulsion performance park et al 2015 there are other methods for improving the fuel efficiency such as optimising the hull form installing energy saving devices esds using renewable energy and improving the mechanical processes krasilnikov et al 2019 esds are one of the most economical and effective methods and they can be applied to new and retrofitted ships in general esds that are installed at the stern can be divided into three categories according to their installation location carlton 2012 the first type is located in front of the propeller to improve the inflow and this includes a pre swirl stator pss and a pre swirl duct the second type changes the propeller itself to improve the efficiency and this includes a contra rotating propeller and a tip rake propeller the third type improves the propulsion efficiency by changing the wake or hub vortex of the propeller and this includes a rudder bulb propeller boss cap fins and a twisted rudder computational fluid dynamics cfd is widely used in complex hydrodynamic problems and it has been used in esds research to achieve good results cfd can be used to determine the macroscopic forces as well as detailed flow field information wang et al 2018a nowruzi and najafi 2019 lee et al 2019 in recent years many researchers have used numerical simulations and model tests to study esds dang et al 2012 systematically studied esds which include pss a pre duct with an inner stator pds and hub fins hfs propulsion tests showed that hfs pss and pds can increase the total propulsion efficiency of the ship model by approximately 2 4 and 6 respectively kawakita et al 2012 simulated the cavitation mechanism around the marine propellers with esds such as the reaction fin in front of the propeller and the stator fin behind the propeller a reaction fin is only suitable for low speed ships because it creates resistance in contrast a stator fin produces thrust hence it can be used for high speed slender ships sun et al 2015 conducted experiments and a numerical simulation to examine the hydrodynamic performance of a twisted rudder and the experimental energy saving effect was 2 23 for the design advance coefficient value shen et al 2016 numerically analysed the scale effects of a rudder bulb and rudder thrust fin on the propulsion efficiency the results showed that the model scale simulations predicted efficiency gains of 4 85 whereas the full scale simulations indicated efficiency gains of 2 28 yoo et al 2019 designed a new type of pre swirl duct and their cfd results showed a maximum reduction rate of 7 6 for the delivered power at a model scale researchers usually extrapolate the hydrodynamic performance of a full scale ship from a model scale experimental or numerical simulation results in order to evaluate the ship propulsion performance guo et al 2018 gong et al 2019 wang et al 2018b however model scale results often differ from those of ship sea trials due to the scale effect of the stern flow field castro et al 2011 hochkirch and mallol 2013 zhao et al 2019 shen et al 2016 noted that the energy gain of the esds that were predicted from the model scale differed from the actual full scale gain this is because the esds work in the vessel boundary layer which is determined by the viscosity in addition an analysis of the free surface scale effect and the viscous wake structure showed that the scale effect cannot be ignored and it strongly depends on the stern geometry visonneau et al 2006 although research in esds has recently increased only a few studies have analysed the propulsion performance of a large scale ship model with esds at sea the present study focuses on the 230000dwt csb fortune which is a very large ore carrier vloc this investigation used the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans approach huyer 2016 kim et al 2017 lidtke et al 2017 to examine the influence of the esds on the ship propulsion performance the interaction mechanism between the hull and the esds including the pss and rudder bulb was analysed the cfd analysis was verified by comparing the results with the test results that were obtained from a large scale ship model in actual sea conditions the hydrodynamic characteristics were used to examine the variations in the wake field waveform and pressure distribution before and after the esd installation to clarify the effects of the esds on the ship propulsion performance and working mechanism of the esds the results from this study will hopefully provide guidance for the design and performance evaluation of esds the remainder of this paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the numerical simulation method section 3 presents the test setup of a large scale ship model section 4 presents the analysis of the numerical and experimental results and section 5 summarises the findings of this study its limitations and our recommendations for future research 2 numerical model and approach 2 1 governing equations the urans method is a practical approach that is used particularly for the resistance self propulsion and open water propeller simulations it can be employed to perform simulations of the flow field which facilitates the hydrodynamic analysis of ships with a reasonable mesh size and an acceptable calculation time flows are governed by the general conservation laws for energy mass and momentum which are collectively called the navier stokes equations wang et al 2019 the governing equations for the cfd analysis are composed of the continuity and momentum equations which are discretised by the finite volume method with unstructured meshes the motion compliant continuity and momentum conservation equations farkas et al 2018 wilcox 2006 are expressed as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t x j u i u j u j u i 1 ρ p x i 1 ρ s j i x j 3 s j i μ u i x j u j x i where ρ is the fluid density t is the time u i and u j i j 1 2 3 denote the velocity components x i and x j are the position vectors in the tensor notation p is the pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity u j u i are the reynolds stresses and s j i is the averaged viscous force tensor component 2 2 turbulence model and free surface treatment the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model menter 1994 wilcox 2008 hu et al 2013 wang et al 2017 was employed to solve and determine the close form expression the governing equation was solved by using a pressure based coupling method the dissipation term was discretised by using a second order central difference scheme two equation turbulence models were used to compute the turbulent kinetic energy k and the turbulence length scale or the equivalent wilcox 2006 an implicit pseudo time marching scheme was used to achieve convergence and the convection term was discretised by using a second order upwind scheme the free surface of the ocean was captured by using the two phase volume of fluid vof method which is a fixed grid technique that is designed for two or more immiscible fluids the position of the interface between the fluids is the unknown term that needs to be determined shen et al 2016 the vof method provides a region tracking scheme with minimum storage requirements the vof method tracks regions instead of surfaces and it avoids all logical problems that are related to intersecting surfaces hirt and nichols 1981 furthermore it has a strong robustness and reliability for the analysis of complex nonlinear free surfaces and the wave making problem of ships shin et al 2019 2 3 geometric model this study used a large scale vloc model with a length of 25 m the block coefficient was 0 83 and the model was a fully formed ship with a bulbous bow parallel mid body and transom stern fig 1 shows the numerical and test models at sea the size of the large scale model was the same as that used for the numerical analysis to reduce the number of calculation grids and resources we simplified the superstructure because it has minimal influence on the total resistance of the hull the main parameters of the model geometry are presented in table 1 fig 2 shows the pss and propeller viewed from the downstream the pss was provided by the shanghai ship and shipping research institute sssri and it was installed in front of the propeller it has three stator fins on the port side from the downstream view the vertically upward direction was 0 and the angle was increased in the counter clockwise direction three stator fins of the same shape were installed at 15 68 and 162 respectively in addition the diameter of the pss was 1 07 times that of the propeller fig 3 shows the esds installed at the stern which includes the pss and rudder bulb mounted on a semi spade rudder the distance between the pss plane and the propeller disk was 0 217d p and the separation between the rudder bulb and propeller hub was 0 028d p 2 4 computational domain and mesh generation in this study the origin of the cartesian coordinate system is located at the centre of the rudder stock the positive x axis is in the bow direction the positive y axis is in the port direction and the positive z axis is in the upward direction as shown in fig 4 the rectangular computational domain of the self propulsion simulations had a length of 5l pp along the x axis a width of 3l pp along the y axis and a height of 3l pp along the z axis the distance between the bow and velocity inlet of the fluid domain was 1 5l pp and the distance between the stern and the pressure outlet of the fluid domain was 2 5l pp in addition the distances from the free surface to the upper and lower boundaries of the velocity inlet were l pp and 2l pp respectively the boundary conditions of the two sides were set to symmetric planes the vessel was fixed without a trim or sinkage the velocity magnitude vm corresponds to the froude number fr and it is defined by the velocity of the flat vof wave field function and the hydrostatic pressure of the same function was imposed on the pressure outlet three velocities were considered namely fr 0 11 0 13 and 0 15 the implicit unsteady method was adopted because of the transient characteristics of the vof method a grid is a discrete expression of the computational domain and numerical solvers were used to provide a solution for the grid the trimmed cell method was used for meshing in the background domain and a polyhedral mesh was used in the rotating region of the propeller for a given number of cells the trimmed and polyhedral grids can yield more accurate results than tetrahedral elements siemens 2019 the sliding mesh method mcnaughton et al 2014 zhou and rempfer 2013 was used at the interface to satisfy the continuity and conservation of the physical values the mesh needs to be refined in specific areas such as the bow stern propeller esds and the free surface to obtain accurate flow field details fig 5 shows the mesh of the surface of the ship model the mixed wall function was adopted and resulted in a y between 30 and 300 the hull roughness of the test ship model was approximately 100 μm after polishing and painting furthermore the effect of the hull roughness is negligible at a speed of less than 8 kn niklas and pruszko 2019 3 large scale model test at sea the forces on a vessel that was made of glass fibre reinforced plastic were measured at sea 35 9 n 120 2 e for experimental verification the water temperature and depth in the test area were approximately 21 c and 20 m respectively the details of the test and data are presented in a previous paper lin et al 2020 the monte carlo method was used in a previous study for the uncertainty analysis of a large scale ship model test at sea zhou et al 2020 3 1 experimental setup fig 6 shows the layout of the experimental setup for the self propulsion test at sea the on board experimental devices were categorised into three systems these included the propulsion system comprising the generator integrated cabinet servomotor shaft and propeller autopilot system comprising the console motor rudder stock and semi spade rudder and measurement system comprising the data collection instrument self propulsion instrument global positioning system gps inertial navigation system ins antenna gyroscope console computer and anemorumbometer the measurement system also included a buoy type wave weight instrument in the test area the rotating speed of the propeller was controlled as required by using a servomotor the autopilot system maintained the course of the ship model at sea the model s track speed attitude and the parameters of the marine environment such as the wind and wave conditions were obtained using the measurement system the thrust and torque of the propeller were measured by using an independently developed broken shaft type bst self propulsion instrument as depicted in fig 7 the bst self propulsion instrument used two independent structures to measure the thrust and torque of the propeller hence different strain units of the bore only have axial or circumferential deformation which minimizes the crosstalk between the thrust and torque the errors in the thrust and torque of the propeller were measured to be less than 2 of the reading the ship model had a total weight of more than 100 t therefore the landing and launching costs were high to facilitate underwater replacement of the esds by divers we designed a dismountable pss and rudder bulb as shown in fig 8 3 2 experimental scheme the experimental scheme was divided into three stages as depicted in fig 9 1 preparation before the trial mainly included determining whether the weather and equipment conditions were suitable for the test 2 in the experiment the ship model sailed in a straight line in a fixed direction and the increase in the propeller rotating speed with respect to the initial value was measured when data acquisition was completed the ship model turned around and the test procedure was repeated 3 to mitigate the uncertainties at sea we conducted the experiment multiple times and the data were processed and verified 4 results and discussion the viscous flow around the ship model was numerically simulated with and without the esds and the results were compared with those obtained from the experiment the flow field characteristics of the esds were analysed to determine their working mechanism 4 1 verification and validation study the verification study for the grid size and timestep was performed without the esds when fr 0 15 the grid convergence index gci was used to assess the uncertainty of the simulation results for the large scale model three grid resolutions 3 6 and 12 million elements were adopted to evaluate the solution stability and the convergence of the propeller thrust t and torque q as listed in table 2 the richardson extrapolated re value and gci were calculated as follows park et al 2015 kwaśniewski 2013 celik et al 2008 4 r e f f i n e f f i n e f m e d i u m r p 1 5 g c i 1 25 ε r p 1 6 ε f f i n e f m e d i u m f f i n e 7 p l n f f i n e f m e d i u m f m e d i u m f c o a r s e l n r where f fine f medium and f coarse are the results at the fine medium and coarse levels respectively p is the order of the accuracy ε is the relative error and r 2 the value recommended by the ittc 2017 which is the uniform parameter refinement ratio the results of the numerical uncertainty are listed in table 3 the simulations revealed good grid convergence behaviour and the errors with the corresponding re were less than 0 5 a grid resolution of six million elements was selected in this study while considering the solution time and the large number of simulation cases when the propeller was off the timestep was set to 0 005 l pp v m the value recommended by the ittc 2011 and su et al 2020 when the propeller was on the timestep was set based on the rotation rate of the propeller the results that were obtained for the verification study with the timestep as the input parameter are listed in table 4 the timestep was set to 2 per step while considering the calculation time table 5 shows the cfd results of the skin friction coefficient c f on the bare hull in comparison with the recommended ittc 1957 results c f 0 075 l o g 10 r e 2 2 where re is the reynolds number fig 10 shows the distribution of the skin friction coefficient on the hull surface without the esds it can be observed from the skin friction coefficient results that the boundary layer was well simulated thereby providing confidence for the accuracy of the self propulsion simulation table 6 summarises the experimental fluid dynamics efd and cfd results for the influence of the esds on the propulsion performance at different inflow speeds the average gain of the esds relative to no esds was up to 3 a simulation was performed to determine the thrust coefficient k t and torque coefficient k q which are defined as follows 8 k t t ρ n 2 d p 4 9 k q q ρ n 2 d p 5 in these equations ρ is the density of seawater at 21 c and n is the rotating speed of the propeller although the percentage error between the calculated results and the experimental data was high both results exhibited the same trend and the propeller produced more thrust due to the presence of the esds the delivered power p d 2 π n q with the esds was approximately 10 higher than that without the esds at the same speed the deviation between the calculated and experimental results can be explained as follows the cfd and experimental results for the kelvin wave showed good agreement as shown in fig 11 a large number of waves at the bow and stern were broken at sea by a combination of the wind and wave loads see fig 11a however this behaviour was not adequately incorporated in the numerical simulation which assumed calm water considering the effects of the wind waves and current in the sea trial an error of less than 30 between the test data and the numerical results in calm water is acceptable in addition the deviation had minimal influence on the working mechanism of the esds which is the focus of this study 4 2 flow field characteristics five sections were selected at the stern for the flow field analysis as demonstrated in fig 12 section e x d p 0 passed through the origin whereas section c x d p 0 603 is the propeller disk the distances of sections a b and d from the propeller disk were respectively 0 217 0 102 and 0 168 and were multiplied by the propeller diameter d p the distributions of the cross flow velocity vector and the non dimensional axial velocity v x v 0 scalar in fig 13 shows the influence of the esds on the flow field characteristics at section a the hook shaped vortex flow was produced due to the shape of the stern which is well represented at the same time the axial velocity increased particularly between stator fins ⅱ and iii defined in fig 8 in addition a small scale positive swirl was produced between stator fins ⅰ and ⅱ by the pss on the portside of the ship model with the esds the pss ensured that the tangential flow was more uniform particularly in the upper left part of sections b and c the low speed area of the axial velocity was greater at the centre of section d with the esds than without them due to the blockage of the rudder bulb moreover the esds increased the axial velocity after the propeller in sections d and e which improved the propulsion performance of the propeller the small scale viscous vortex on the left side of the rudder in section e was reduced because of the rudder bulb see fig 14 the analysis of the turbulent kinetic energy ke in the propeller slipstream is useful to elucidate the working principle of the esds as shown in fig 13 in general the presence of the esds decreased the turbulent ke before and after the propeller which increased the energy utilisation rate of the propeller it can be observed from section d that the presence of a rudder bulb can reduce the turbulence ke at the hub vortex the turbulent ke of the propeller tip vortex was weaker than the strength of the hub vortex as observed in section e the amount of energy that was saved along the portside of the flow was the highest fig 15 shows the flow streamlines past the stern coloured by the vorticity magnitude and the pressure coefficient c p p p 0 0 5 ρ v m 2 where p 0 is the reference pressure distributions on the ship with and without the esds when fr 0 15 the hub vortex did not deviate from the axial direction with the vorticity which is concentrated near the rudder bulb in addition the strength of the hub vortex decreased with the presence of the esds 4 3 pressure distribution fig 16 shows the distributions of the pressure coefficient on the ship with and without the esds when fr 0 11 the esds significantly changed the pressure distribution in the stern figs 17 19 show a comparison of the cp distributions on the surfaces of the rudder and propeller with and without the esds compared with a bare rudder installing the esds eliminated the low pressure area on the portside after the rudder bulb in addition the cp distributions on the starboard and the portside of the rudder were more uniform thereby improving the course stability meanwhile the pss had more influence on the cp distribution on the suction side of the propeller the differences in the cp are more significant for the propeller blades behind pss fins ⅱ and ⅲ see figs 2 and 8 which helped to improve the propulsion efficiency 5 conclusions a series of self propulsion numerical calculations and experimental measurements were carried out to study the working mechanism of the esds in a large scale ship model to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the computational methodology we conducted a grid convergence study under self propulsion conditions and the results were compared with the experimental data the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient of the propeller were determined at different inflow speeds to quantitatively describe the interactions between the hull propeller rudder and esds the flow field characteristics and pressure distribution of a 25 m long ship model were analysed in detail the following conclusions are drawn from the findings of this study within the range of the inflow velocities considered in this study the cfd predicted a wake similar to that which was observed in the large scale model test at sea the efd and cfd propulsion characteristics differed because of the influence of the wind waves and current in the sea trial however the trends were consistent and the ship with the esds generated more thrust in the same cases for the 25 m long ship model the wake field at the stern showed that the pss that was installed in front of the propeller can significantly homogenise the inflow of the propeller and positively interfere with the hull the rudder bulb behind the propeller can optimise the flow direction and the vorticity of the hub vortex and ensure a more uniform pressure distribution on the rudder surface which improves the course stability of the ship the esds in this study have great applicability in the context of energy conservation however the present numerical simulation is limited to calm water conditions in addition the environmental effects of the wind waves and current under real sea conditions were not considered variations in the trim angle and heave affect the propulsion performance of the ship hence they need to be accounted for despite the limitations of this study the results clearly verified that the esds can significantly improve the propulsion performance of a ship while maintaining normal operating preferences future research should focus on the interaction between the pre swirl stator and rudder bulb system as efficient esds with different types of hulls this can be used to assess the propulsion performance of conventional and unconventional ships funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation

et al 2014 zhou and rempfer 2013 was used at the interface to satisfy the continuity and conservation of the physical values the mesh needs to be refined in specific areas such as the bow stern propeller esds and the free surface to obtain accurate flow field details fig 5 shows the mesh of the surface of the ship model the mixed wall function was adopted and resulted in a y between 30 and 300 the hull roughness of the test ship model was approximately 100 μm after polishing and painting furthermore the effect of the hull roughness is negligible at a speed of less than 8 kn niklas and pruszko 2019 3 large scale model test at sea the forces on a vessel that was made of glass fibre reinforced plastic were measured at sea 35 9 n 120 2 e for experimental verification the water temperature and depth in the test area were approximately 21 c and 20 m respectively the details of the test and data are presented in a previous paper lin et al 2020 the monte carlo method was used in a previous study for the uncertainty analysis of a large scale ship model test at sea zhou et al 2020 3 1 experimental setup fig 6 shows the layout of the experimental setup for the self propulsion test at sea the on board experimental devices were categorised into three systems these included the propulsion system comprising the generator integrated cabinet servomotor shaft and propeller autopilot system comprising the console motor rudder stock and semi spade rudder and measurement system comprising the data collection instrument self propulsion instrument global positioning system gps inertial navigation system ins antenna gyroscope console computer and anemorumbometer the measurement system also included a buoy type wave weight instrument in the test area the rotating speed of the propeller was controlled as required by using a servomotor the autopilot system maintained the course of the ship model at sea the model s track speed attitude and the parameters of the marine environment such as the wind and wave conditions were obtained using the measurement system the thrust and torque of the propeller were measured by using an independently developed broken shaft type bst self propulsion instrument as depicted in fig 7 the bst self propulsion instrument used two independent structures to measure the thrust and torque of the propeller hence different strain units of the bore only have axial or circumferential deformation which minimizes the crosstalk between the thrust and torque the errors in the thrust and torque of the propeller were measured to be less than 2 of the reading the ship model had a total weight of more than 100 t therefore the landing and launching costs were high to facilitate underwater replacement of the esds by divers we designed a dismountable pss and rudder bulb as shown in fig 8 3 2 experimental scheme the experimental scheme was divided into three stages as depicted in fig 9 1 preparation before the trial mainly included determining whether the weather and equipment conditions were suitable for the test 2 in the experiment the ship model sailed in a straight line in a fixed direction and the increase in the propeller rotating speed with respect to the initial value was measured when data acquisition was completed the ship model turned around and the test procedure was repeated 3 to mitigate the uncertainties at sea we conducted the experiment multiple times and the data were processed and verified 4 results and discussion the viscous flow around the ship model was numerically simulated with and without the esds and the results were compared with those obtained from the experiment the flow field characteristics of the esds were analysed to determine their working mechanism 4 1 verification and validation study the verification study for the grid size and timestep was performed without the esds when fr 0 15 the grid convergence index gci was used to assess the uncertainty of the simulation results for the large scale model three grid resolutions 3 6 and 12 million elements were adopted to evaluate the solution stability and the convergence of the propeller thrust t and torque q as listed in table 2 the richardson extrapolated re value and gci were calculated as follows park et al 2015 kwaśniewski 2013 celik et al 2008 4 r e f f i n e f f i n e f m e d i u m r p 1 5 g c i 1 25 ε r p 1 6 ε f f i n e f m e d i u m f f i n e 7 p l n f f i n e f m e d i u m f m e d i u m f c o a r s e l n r where f fine f medium and f coarse are the results at the fine medium and coarse levels respectively p is the order of the accuracy ε is the relative error and r 2 the value recommended by the ittc 2017 which is the uniform parameter refinement ratio the results of the numerical uncertainty are listed in table 3 the simulations revealed good grid convergence behaviour and the errors with the corresponding re were less than 0 5 a grid resolution of six million elements was selected in this study while considering the solution time and the large number of simulation cases when the propeller was off the timestep was set to 0 005 l pp v m the value recommended by the ittc 2011 and su et al 2020 when the propeller was on the timestep was set based on the rotation rate of the propeller the results that were obtained for the verification study with the timestep as the input parameter are listed in table 4 the timestep was set to 2 per step while considering the calculation time table 5 shows the cfd results of the skin friction coefficient c f on the bare hull in comparison with the recommended ittc 1957 results c f 0 075 l o g 10 r e 2 2 where re is the reynolds number fig 10 shows the distribution of the skin friction coefficient on the hull surface without the esds it can be observed from the skin friction coefficient results that the boundary layer was well simulated thereby providing confidence for the accuracy of the self propulsion simulation table 6 summarises the experimental fluid dynamics efd and cfd results for the influence of the esds on the propulsion performance at different inflow speeds the average gain of the esds relative to no esds was up to 3 a simulation was performed to determine the thrust coefficient k t and torque coefficient k q which are defined as follows 8 k t t ρ n 2 d p 4 9 k q q ρ n 2 d p 5 in these equations ρ is the density of seawater at 21 c and n is the rotating speed of the propeller although the percentage error between the calculated results and the experimental data was high both results exhibited the same trend and the propeller produced more thrust due to the presence of the esds the delivered power p d 2 π n q with the esds was approximately 10 higher than that without the esds at the same speed the deviation between the calculated and experimental results can be explained as follows the cfd and experimental results for the kelvin wave showed good agreement as shown in fig 11 a large number of waves at the bow and stern were broken at sea by a combination of the wind and wave loads see fig 11a however this behaviour was not adequately incorporated in the numerical simulation which assumed calm water considering the effects of the wind waves and current in the sea trial an error of less than 30 between the test data and the numerical results in calm water is acceptable in addition the deviation had minimal influence on the working mechanism of the esds which is the focus of this study 4 2 flow field characteristics five sections were selected at the stern for the flow field analysis as demonstrated in fig 12 section e x d p 0 passed through the origin whereas section c x d p 0 603 is the propeller disk the distances of sections a b and d from the propeller disk were respectively 0 217 0 102 and 0 168 and were multiplied by the propeller diameter d p the distributions of the cross flow velocity vector and the non dimensional axial velocity v x v 0 scalar in fig 13 shows the influence of the esds on the flow field characteristics at section a the hook shaped vortex flow was produced due to the shape of the stern which is well represented at the same time the axial velocity increased particularly between stator fins ⅱ and iii defined in fig 8 in addition a small scale positive swirl was produced between stator fins ⅰ and ⅱ by the pss on the portside of the ship model with the esds the pss ensured that the tangential flow was more uniform particularly in the upper left part of sections b and c the low speed area of the axial velocity was greater at the centre of section d with the esds than without them due to the blockage of the rudder bulb moreover the esds increased the axial velocity after the propeller in sections d and e which improved the propulsion performance of the propeller the small scale viscous vortex on the left side of the rudder in section e was reduced because of the rudder bulb see fig 14 the analysis of the turbulent kinetic energy ke in the propeller slipstream is useful to elucidate the working principle of the esds as shown in fig 13 in general the presence of the esds decreased the turbulent ke before and after the propeller which increased the energy utilisation rate of the propeller it can be observed from section d that the presence of a rudder bulb can reduce the turbulence ke at the hub vortex the turbulent ke of the propeller tip vortex was weaker than the strength of the hub vortex as observed in section e the amount of energy that was saved along the portside of the flow was the highest fig 15 shows the flow streamlines past the stern coloured by the vorticity magnitude and the pressure coefficient c p p p 0 0 5 ρ v m 2 where p 0 is the reference pressure distributions on the ship with and without the esds when fr 0 15 the hub vortex did not deviate from the axial direction with the vorticity which is concentrated near the rudder bulb in addition the strength of the hub vortex decreased with the presence of the esds 4 3 pressure distribution fig 16 shows the distributions of the pressure coefficient on the ship with and without the esds when fr 0 11 the esds significantly changed the pressure distribution in the stern figs 17 19 show a comparison of the cp distributions on the surfaces of the rudder and propeller with and without the esds compared with a bare rudder installing the esds eliminated the low pressure area on the portside after the rudder bulb in addition the cp distributions on the starboard and the portside of the rudder were more uniform thereby improving the course stability meanwhile the pss had more influence on the cp distribution on the suction side of the propeller the differences in the cp are more significant for the propeller blades behind pss fins ⅱ and ⅲ see figs 2 and 8 which helped to improve the propulsion efficiency 5 conclusions a series of self propulsion numerical calculations and experimental measurements were carried out to study the working mechanism of the esds in a large scale ship model to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the computational methodology we conducted a grid convergence study under self propulsion conditions and the results were compared with the experimental data the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient of the propeller were determined at different inflow speeds to quantitatively describe the interactions between the hull propeller rudder and esds the flow field characteristics and pressure distribution of a 25 m long ship model were analysed in detail the following conclusions are drawn from the findings of this study within the range of the inflow velocities considered in this study the cfd predicted a wake similar to that which was observed in the large scale model test at sea the efd and cfd propulsion characteristics differed because of the influence of the wind waves and current in the sea trial however the trends were consistent and the ship with the esds generated more thrust in the same cases for the 25 m long ship model the wake field at the stern showed that the pss that was installed in front of the propeller can significantly homogenise the inflow of the propeller and positively interfere with the hull the rudder bulb behind the propeller can optimise the flow direction and the vorticity of the hub vortex and ensure a more uniform pressure distribution on the rudder surface which improves the course stability of the ship the esds in this study have great applicability in the context of energy conservation however the present numerical simulation is limited to calm water conditions in addition the environmental effects of the wind waves and current under real sea conditions were not considered variations in the trim angle and heave affect the propulsion performance of the ship hence they need to be accounted for despite the limitations of this study the results clearly verified that the esds can significantly improve the propulsion performance of a ship while maintaining normal operating preferences future research should focus on the interaction between the pre swirl stator and rudder bulb system as efficient esds with different types of hulls this can be used to assess the propulsion performance of conventional and unconventional ships funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation

21331,the hybrid monopile foundation is an alternative for offshore wind turbines the parametric study has been performed through a series of centrifuge tests for the optimal design of the hybrid foundation the wheel diameter wheel thickness and pile length are considered in the analysis the lateral capacity of the hybrid monopile foundation increases with the wheel diameter and tends to accelerate it increases linearly with the wheel thickness and pile length the influence of the wheel diameter is more pronounced compared to the other parameters the hybrid monopile demonstrates an enhanced performance compared to the monopile and the single wheel the improvement is more significant at small pile lengths the hybrid monopile shows its advantages in reducing the pile length it has great potential in reducing capital costs an analytical method is proposed by scaling the individual capacity of the pile and the wheel a design chart for the scale factor is suggested the calculation is applicable for determining the initial dimension of the hybrid monopile foundation and the ultimate lateral capacity is assessed keywords bearing capacity centrifuge modeling cohesionless soil offshore wind turbine parametric study hybrid monopile foundation 1 introduction renewable energy attracts massive amounts of attention in recent years to achieve the goal of lower carbon emissions and longer energy service lives switching conventional energy resources to renewable energy is beneficial for the environment and the economy petrakopoulou 2016 wind energy is one of the most promising renewable energy resources being plentiful widely distributed and clean has been utilized extensively li et al 2018 by the end of 2019 the global cumulative installed wind capacity is 651 gw with an increase of 17 comparing to 2018 gwec 2020 notably the offshore wind shows promise due to the faster wind speed and lower disturbance to human lives consequently more attention has been moved to offshore wind farms comparing to the onshore counterpart the offshore wind has 1 2 2 times faster wind speed in open sea areas the electrical output is expected to be 1 7 times for the same wind turbine and the energy yield tends to be more efficient by going further from coastlines kaldellis et al 2016 li and yu 2017 in europe the offshore wind contributes 45 of the total installed wind capacity there is 3 6 gw of new capacity connected to the grid in 2019 which is 1 3 times the capacity in 2018 besides the increasing capacity the average water depth and distance to land for the newly installed offshore wind turbines owts are 33 m and 59 km which are more than 2 times and 4 times of those in 2009 windeurope 2020 these revolutions will further complex the environmental condition of the offshore wind site and the transportation and installation processes will face more challenges therefore investigations of the bearing behavior of the owt under variable loading conditions are necessary the outcome will fulfill the higher requirements for the new generation of the offshore wind industry the total cost of an offshore wind project is 30 50 higher than the onshore wind project snyder and kaiser 2009 among which the cost for the foundation design construction and installation accounts for as much as 35 of the capital cost byrne and houlsby 2006 meanwhile the foundation part has a great potential in cost reductions with the potential of being 6 less by introducing innovative techniques by 2020 oxford 2015 owts are light weight structures and they come as clusters the foundation connects with the seabed directly the installation cost of the support structure is 60 of the total cost for installing the whole wind turbine estate 2012 therefore a reliable and efficient foundation is preferable for the offshore wind industry and a single design with the potential of mass production is necessary each type of offshore wind foundation has its advantages and limitations the selection of foundation type is according to the geotechnical investigation turbine capacity and site environmental condition koh and ng 2016 sun et al 2012 most of the existing owts are supported by fixed foundations with a water depth of less than 30 m and the floating foundation is under development in order to adapt for deeper water oxford 2015 sun et al 2012 the typical types of offshore wind turbine foundations are schematically plotted in fig 1 wang et al 2018b currently the most widely used support structure for owt is the monopile foundation in europe there are 4258 monopile supported owts accounting for 81 of the total market share by 2019 windeurope 2020 the monopile foundation is a large diameter pipe pile and 40 50 of the total length is driven into the seabed to provide vertical and lateral resistances kaiser and snyder 2010 zhixin et al 2009 the manufacture and construction technique are relatively mature however the pile diameter will turn to be very large by moving into more immense water depth the material and installation cost will increase significantly pérez collazo et al 2015 the gravity foundation is another popular shallow foundation which accounts for 5 7 of the market share in europe with a total number of 301 windeurope 2020 the gravity base provides resistances by its self weight and it is fabricated by reinforced concrete with ballasts the seabed preparation is necessary during the installation although the materials and constructions are less expensive than the monopile foundation the installation cost is a significant concern the gravity base is used at the offshore sites that the pile is not easy to drive vølund 2005 in the relatively more significant water depth the jacket foundation is used by 2017 468 jacket foundations have been installed to support owts in europe contributing to 8 9 of the total market share windeurope 2020 the jacket foundation is designed with a lattice truss that has three or four tubular steel legs and this concept has been used initially as the offshore platform foundation koh and ng 2016 the adaptable water depth is expended to up to 80 m but the increasing cost for construction and installation is the main limitation for practical applications pérez collazo et al 2015 the suction bucket foundation has been investigated by several researchers currently fu et al 2017 2020 sun et al 2020 xiao et al 2019 an upside down bucket is inserted into the seabed with the aid of its self weight and suction which significantly accelerates the installation saving time and costs zhang et al 2015 2016 this novel concept is originally used as anchors for offshore oil gas platforms and it is believed to be an effective alternative for owts guo et al 2011 however the application of the suction bucket foundation is significantly limited by the water depth and soil conditions the traditional foundations for offshore wind turbines have their advantages and limitations considering the current requirements of the offshore wind industry innovative foundations are investigated with wider adaptability focuses are put on the enhancement of traditional monopiles bienen et al 2012 li et al 2020a the hybrid monopile foundation combining the traditional monopile and the gravity base is investigated in this study fig 2 this concept is initialized by the pile caps and the embedded retaining wall with a stabilizing platform mokwa and duncan 2003 powrie and daly 2007 zhou et al 2011 a friction wheel is added at the seabed to reinforce the underlying soil and provide an additional restoring moment to the monopile the friction force under the wheel is capable of reducing the lateral movement of the foundation during the external loadings the earth pressure acting on the embedded part of the wheel provides extra lateral resistances meanwhile the relative scour depth is reduced since the wheel enlarges the contacting area between the foundation and the seabed soil liang et al 2019 qi and gao 2019 wang et al 2017 2018c which is beneficial for minimizing the scour failure the design of the hybrid monopile foundation can learn from the established standard for monopile and gravity base which accelerates the investigation of this innovative concept several studies have been conducted to investigate the performance of the hybrid monopile foundation lehane et al 2014 examined the improved bearing capacity of a monopile foundation that combined with a footing in the centrifuge it was demonstrated that the tension capacity of the pile leads to a larger effective area of the footing and the footing brought a more significant resisting moment to the monopile arshi et al arshi and stone 2015b investigated the lateral resistance improvement of the monopile foundation by adding a footing the lab test and the numerical simulation were conducted and it was illustrated that the pile diameter and the wheel diameter were critical factors in influencing the foundation response stone et al 2018 conducted a series of centrifuge tests to examine the lateral capacity as well as the vertical bearing capacity of the hybrid monopiled footing the lateral response of the hybrid foundation is influenced by the pile plate dimension and the prestress on the plate the coupled and uncoupled hybrid systems demonstrated different failure mechanisms during external loads the feasibility study of the hybrid monopile foundation was conducted in our laboratory and the behavior of the hybrid monopile foundation for offshore wind turbines was checked both under static and cyclic loading conditions wang et al 2018a yang et al 2018 the initial design chart had been summarized the hybrid monopile foundation is a new concept the above mentioned studies put more focuses on studying the mechanism of the foundation and the parametric study has not been reported it is necessary to investigate the influence factors in order to provide design reference and booster the application of the foundation in this study a set of hybrid monopile foundations is a design by considering the influence of pile length wheel diameter and wheel thickness the parametric study is performed in cohesionless soil the models are tested in the centrifuge to check their improved performances the results are compared with the original monopile and the wheel foundation the study aims to provide well documented test data for practical designs the theoretical calculations are conducted and checked with the centrifuge tests the design chart of the hybrid monopile foundation is suggested 2 centrifuge testing program a set of centrifuge tests was conducted to investigate the bearing behavior of the hybrid monopile foundation and the focus is to gain insights into the effect of the influence factors the centrifuge tests were conducted on the geotechnical centrifuge at case western reserve university figueroa et al 1998 the centrifuge test is a reliable experimental method in studying geotechnical problems hong et al 2017 the stress state of soil is more similar to the field condition by testing the small scale models under larger gravitational levels the maximum acceleration was 50 g in this study all the data presented in the following sections are in the prototype scale data interpretations are according to centrifuge scaling law chandrasekaran 2003 the centrifuge testing program is summarized in table 1 a total number of twenty seven hybrid monopile foundations were tested the parametric study includes factors of wheel diameter wheel thickness and pile length diameters of the wheels dw are 3 m 4 m 5 m and 7 m the thicknesses of the wheels t are 0 475 m 0 95 m and 1 425 m the pile diameter dp is 1 1 m embedded pile lengths l are 1 1 m 3 3 m and 5 5 m leading to l dp ratios of 1 5 the model pile and the model plate are fabricated from aluminum rods and aluminum plates with an ultimate tensile strength of 124 mpa and a yield strength of 55 2 mpa in all cases the stiffness of the pile and the plate are considered to respond rigidly the test id is represented by four parts the first part is the foundation type besides the hybrid monopile the traditional monopile foundation and the wheel foundation are tested for comparisons the second and third part is the wheel diameter and wheel thickness which are represented by d and t respectively the last section illustrates the pile length for example the h d3 2t l1 represents the hybrid monopile foundation with a wheel diameter of 3 m and a thickness of 0 95 m and the pile length is 1 1 m l dp 1 the rest models are depicted in fig 3 the models share the same upper structure the wind tower is fabricated by a steel rod and the tower head is simplified as a lumped mass the model is designed according to a 3 mw offshore wind turbine located with an aspect ratio of 1 10 ding et al 2015 the centrifuge tests were performed in the saturated silica sand li et al 2019 the critical mechanical properties of the silica sand are listed in table 2 the silica sand was oven dried for 24 h after which the dry sand was air alleviated into the rigid container with a constant falling height in the centrifuge slight compaction is applied to acquire the desire relative density the rigid container has a length of 26 6 m a width of 12 m and a depth of 8 9 m the de air water was instilled from the bottom of the container slowly and the vacuum was on for at least 24 h to achieve full saturation the silica sand has a relatively smaller particle size which is useful for minimizing the scale effect under higher gravitational levels meanwhile scaling down the soil particle size is beneficial for reducing the soil permeability which overcomes the larger flow rate referring to the centrifuge scaling law de nicola and randolph 1997 qi et al 2016 according to the kozeny carman equation the permeability of the silica sand was 5 85 10 4 m s carman 1937 the silica sand has the advantage of maintaining its internal friction angle for examining the bearing capacity the internal friction angle was measured using the direct shear test which was 33 4 the relative density of the soil deposit was 70 before the tests being classified as dense sand and the unit weight was 5 7 kn m3 the soil parameters were carefully measured before and after the tests astm 2006 wang et al 2019 the testing soil was re prepared with the same procedure for each centrifuge test for the identification the testing models were installed by jacking under the 1 g gravitational level the centrifuge tests lead to relatively smaller results since the 1 g installation will increase the lateral stress of soil that acting on the foundation under higher gravitational levels this increment is overcome by the higher effective stress randolph et al 1992 the diameter of the monopile is the same with the center hole of the wheel and these two parts are assembled without fixity the vertical sliding is allowed between the pile and the wheel during the external loading however the plate is not assumed to be free to move vertically it has been demonstrated that the hybrid system tends to provide a larger bearing capacity when the slight relative sliding occurs the effective area between the wheel and the soil is more significant due to the rotation of the wheel arshi et al 2013 the interface between the wheel and the monopile was greased in our previous study in order to reduce the friction and no significant difference was observed in the bearing behavior yang et al 2018 therefore the change in joint stiffness is not considered in this study the centrifuge tests are load controlled a simplified single linear load was applied by an actuator fixed on the wind tower in the centrifuge tests the loading point is 2 5 m above the mud line representing the combined effects of wind wave and ice etc the lateral load increased from 0 to 1000 kn linearly in 200s monotonically as demonstrated in fig 4 the wind turbine models were loaded to failure referring to the extreme condition the lateral displacements were recorded by an lvdt that was fixed at the same level as the actuator as depicted in fig 5 details of the loading system and the sensor system are described previously wang et al 2018a 3 test results and interpretations 3 1 wheel with different diameters the typical load displacement curves recorded in the centrifuge tests are depicted using the prototype scale in fig 6 the lateral displacement is measured at the actuator level the hybrid monopile foundations with the same pile length but different diameters are plotted together for comparisons the traditional monopiles are also tested and plotted by categorizing the pile length the tests with a pile length equal to zero represent the wheel foundations which are depicted in fig 6d the lateral bearing capacity of the hybrid monopile foundations is clearly larger than the single pile the lateral stiffness of the hybrid foundations is also enhanced especially for hybrid models with larger diameters the phenomenon demonstrates that the wheel contributes significant overall stiffness to the hybrid foundation system moreover the ultimate lateral capacity of the single wheel foundations is smaller compared to the hybrid foundations and the final displacements corresponded to the failure loads are smaller consequently the hybrid monopile foundation is feasible to enhance the capability of traditional foundations the load displacement curves show slight differences between the hybrid foundations and the monopiles the hybrid foundations illustrate platforms on the initial rising sections after which the curves continue increasing with large gradients and reach plateau finally the platform indicates the load transfer mechanism of the hybrid foundation at the initial linear stage the wheel contributes the majority of the lateral bearing capacity the load resistance of the wheel increases rapidly and reaches a plateau at a small lateral deflection afterward the sharing factor of the pile part increases with the continuous development of the lateral deflection exceeding the wheel part quickly the platform represents the transformation from wheel bearing to pile bearing during the external load wang et al 2018a on the contrary the curve of the monopile foundation is much smoother several methods have been proposed to determine the lateral bearing capacity from the load displacement relationship it is demonstrated that the lateral bearing capacity and the initial lateral stiffness of the hybrid monopile foundation increase significantly with the wheel diameter the curves yield gradually as they start from small elastic deformations and transfer to large plastic deformations finally the lateral bearing capacity is extracted at the maximum curvature point mcdowell 2002 the intersection of the two lines that fitted from the beginning and end of the curve is also suggested by graham graham et al 1982 byrne byrne et al 2003 determines the ultimate lateral capacity at the significant changing point which is realized by plotting the displacement rate curve however it is hard to define the changing point by the above criteria since the load transfer mechanism is slightly different for the hybrid monopile foundation meanwhile a rotation angle of 5 representing for the ultimate limit state uls is suggested to identify the ultimate lateral capacity dnv 2016 another lvdt is attached on the wind tower to record the rotation angle li et al 2020b the lateral load is plotted against the rotation angle in fig 7 for the hybrid foundations with a pile length of 5 5 m the maximum angle recorded in the centrifuge test is smaller than 5 due to the recording range of the lvdt in many cases the ultimate lateral capacity is extracted as the maximum load recorded in the test and this method is used by several researchers previously achmus et al 2013 villalobos jara 2006 during the centrifuge tests the hybrid foundation models are loaded to fail with a relatively large input load of 1000 kn the test results demonstrate that the models do fail before this peak value representing the maximum lateral load that they can sustain as a consequence the ultimate lateral capacity is identified as the peak value on the load displacement curves which are listed in table 3 3 2 wheel with different thicknesses the hybrid monopile foundations with the same pile length but different thicknesses are plotted in fig 8 the lateral bearing capacity increases with the increment of the wheel thickness table 4 however the enhancement of the initial stiffness is not that significant as the wheel diameter especially for the wheels with small thicknesses the wheels in this set of hybrid foundation systems share the same diameter so that their soil contacting areas are identical the different thicknesses introduce a set of different gravities representing different prestress acting on the underlying soil it is observed in the figures that for the single wheel foundations the maximum lateral deflections corresponded to failures are smaller than the hybrid foundations the single wheel foundation is similar to the gravity foundation and the main failure mode is the lateral deflection yang et al 2019 without the pile the wheel is not able to resist the large overturning moment and the friction force acting on the soil wheel interaction mainly contributes to resisting the lateral displacement fig 9 presents a picture of the testing model took after stopping the centrifuge h d5 t l1 which reveals the failure mode of the hybrid monopile foundation the hybrid foundation behaves like a rigid body for this high m h ratio since the pile length is relatively small the soil heave in front of the wheel is observed the front part of the wheel embeds into the soil to some depths and the rear part tends to separate with the underlying soil these observations indicate that both the rotation and translation occur during the lateral loading this phenomenon is observed for similar hybrid foundations reported previously chen et al 2020 yang et al 2019 with the rotational tendency of the wheel the vertical stress developing under the front side of the wheel reduces the bending moment being transferred to the pile the passive earth pressure acting on the embedded part of the wheel further increases the resistance capability pedram 2015 the lateral deflection is mainly caused by the pile rotation and soil deformation under the external loading and the wheel is not likely to slide too much the friction at the interface of the wheel and the soil is pronounced and the rotation center of the wheel almost remains at its original position yang et al 2018 the hybrid monopile foundation is not a simple algebraic summation of the wheel and the pile these two parts work systematically to resist lateral loading wang et al 2018a 4 influence factors of the hybrid monopile foundation according to the centrifuge tests the addition of the friction wheel significantly enhances the lateral bearing performance of the hybrid foundation system parametric studies of foundation dimensions are conducted aiming to assess the influence of foundation geometry on the overall lateral bearing behavior the analysis is expected to provide references for optimized design during the application step the diameter of the wheel ranges from 3 m to 7 m and the wheel thickness remains the same 2t in this set of tests the ultimate bearing capacities are plotted against the wheel diameter in fig 10 it is illustrated that the longer pile length leads to a larger capacity moreover the ultimate lateral capacity increases with the wheel diameter and tends to accelerate the relationships are fitted by a series of power curves as shown in fig 9 and the equation is expressed as 1 f u l t a b d w the values of a and b are listed in table 5 by increasing the wheel diameter the underlying soil is compressed more leading to higher effective stress of soil the lateral earth pressure profile along the pile length is different since the distribution of vertical stress is enhanced by the circularly loaded area at the soil surface meanwhile the restoring moment provided by the wheel increases due to the larger rotation arm resulting in better stability these two factors work simultaneously and contribute to the improved lateral bearing capacity of the hybrid foundation system the improvement is pronounced with a wheel diameter larger than 3 m which is almost half of the longest pile length a similar observation was reported previously indicating that the optimal width of a stabilizing base in a foundation system is not less than 50 of the embedment depth of the wall powrie and chandler 1998 however the larger wheel diameter leads to a longer drainage path wang et al 2020 which brings a negative effect on the buildup of the excess pore water pressure the centrifuge tests are loaded slowly to simulate the pseudo static situation and hence the change of pore water pressure is not considered in this study the maximum wheel diameter is limited to 10dp in the current design and hence the validity range of dw in eq 1 is 0 to 10dp the second parameter considered is the wheel thickness a series of hybrid monopile foundations are designed with the same diameter of 5 m and varying thicknesses ranging from t to 3t t 0 475 m the wheels share the same contacting area with the underlying soil and their self weights increase sequentially capacity thickness relationships are depicted in fig 11 the lateral bearing capacity of the hybrid foundation system improves linearly with the wheel thickness being expressed as 2 f u l t a t b the values of a and b are listed in table 6 the intercept b represents the capacity of the monopile foundation since the wheel thickness is 0 the slope increases with the pile length representing the influence of wheel thickness tends to be more significant as the pile length increases the thicker wheels provide larger prestress to the underlying soil so that the effective earth pressure is enhanced and the friction at the soil surface is larger however with a unique wheel diameter the restoring moment could not be improved so significant as the wheel diameter the wheel thickness is limited to 0 5dp in the current design the bearing capacities are plotted against the relative length of the pile in fig 12 the capacity increases linearly with the pile length as expected which is expressed as 3 f u l t a l d p b the values of a and b are listed in table 7 for the wheels with the same thickness the influence of the pile length tends to be more intense when the wheel diameter is smaller than 5 m afterward the effect of extending the pile length weakens the wheel and the pile work together to provide the lateral resistance and the function of the wheel becomes predominant when its diameter increases continuously therefore the diameter of the wheel is suggested to be no larger than 5 m for optimizing the foundation system for the wheels with the same diameter slopes of the curves increase with the thickness functions of the influence factors including the wheel diameter the wheel thickness and the pile length are discussed in this section in summary the ultimate lateral capacity of the hybrid monopile foundation illustrates improvement with the increase of these geometric factors the enhancement is more significant when increasing the wheel diameter and slopes of the curves accelerate the larger gravity and the larger rotation arm contribute to these enhancements simultaneously therefore enlarging the wheel diameter is the most efficient way to optimize the performance of the hybrid foundation besides the foundation dimensions the eccentricity is a key factor for assessing the ultimate lateral capacity of the hybrid foundations chen et al 2020 a numerical analysis is carried out to study the influence of eccentricity using abaqus the numerical models are built according to the hybrid foundation h d5 2t with load eccentricities varying from 1 m to 5 m the foundations are assumed to be wish in place and the installation process is ignored the properties and geometry of the soil is equivalent to the centrifuge tests the soil domain and a typical finite element mesh is presented in fig 13 the 3 dimensional 8 node linear brick elements c3d8r are used in the models and the interactions are simulated by normal hard contact model the numerical model is verified against the centrifuge test fig 14 depicts the load displacement relationships of h d5 2t in various load eccentricities the ultimate lateral capacity decreases with the increase of the loading point and the influence tends to be less significant at larger eccentricities 5 analysis the hybrid monopile foundation is a system that integrates the monopile foundation and the gravity foundation the analytical methods are relatively mature for these two types of traditional foundations these methods can be used for establishing the theoretical calculation method for the hybrid monopile firstly improvements of the hybrid foundations are demonstrated by normalizing their ultimate bearing capacities with capacities of the corresponded monopiles the results are plotted against the wheel diameter or the wheel thickness in fig 15 the improvement factors increase with the wheel diameter and the wheel thickness obviously the improvement is significant when the pile length is small and the ultimate lateral capacity could be around 100 times of the single pile this improvement tends to weaken when the pile length increases for longer piles the lateral bearing capacity is relatively large and hence the addition of the wheel does not show pronounced effects practically the pile may be driven into the bedrock to obtain the desired capacity but the cost will increase significantly the hybrid monopile demonstrates its advantages for these cases the pile length is limited in the soil layer and the wheel is installed on the soil surface to provide additional lateral bearing capacity therefore to gain the lateral bearing capacity of the hybrid system the pile length is not suggested to increase continuously since the improvement decelerates secondly the ultimate lateral capacities of the hybrid monopiles are normalized with the capacities of the single wheel foundations the normalized results are plotted in fig 16 these normalizations demonstrate the improvement between the hybrid monopile and the gravity foundation for each hybrid foundation the improvement factor increases with the pile length and tends to decelerate the hybrid foundations demonstrate a similar enhancement when the wheel diameter is smaller than 7 m afterward the effects of adding the pile weaken significantly meanwhile the effect weakens with the increase of the wheel thickness therefore it is suggested to set limitations for the wheel diameter and the wheel thickness in the hybrid foundation system the continuous increase of the wheel size is not good for optimal design the improvement factor is larger when adding the wheel to the monopile compared to adding the monopile to the wheel the application of the monopile foundation accounts for more than 87 of the installed wind turbines in europe the hybrid monopile foundation can be an alternative for improving the performance of the existing monopiles the hybrid monopile foundation is effective in enhancing the lateral bearing capacity comparing with the traditional monopile as well as the single wheel foundation it is plausible to predict the capacity of the hybrid foundation according to the summation of these two components firstly the lateral bearing capacity of the monopile foundation is analyzed according to the dnv standard for designing the offshore wind turbine foundation dnv 2016 the interaction between soil and piles is typically calculated by the p y method which has been widely used to interpret the pile behavior the p y curve is developed based on the winkler approach which discretizes the soil into a limited number of independent layers that supported by a series of nonlinear springs along with the embedded depth carswell et al 2015 the relationship between the pile displacement and the pile stress for any external loading at the pile head follows the differential equation as follow 4 e p i p d 4 y d z 4 p y 0 where z denotes the position along with the pile depth y is the lateral displacement of the pile p y is the lateral soil reaction ei is the flexural rigidity of the pile the calculated results of the monopile foundation are plotted together with the centrifuge test results in fig 17 the calculated lateral bearing capacity is conservative at small pile driven lengths and tends to be over estimated at larger penetration depths meanwhile the initial stiffness of the dnv curve is larger than the centrifuge test but the curves tend to stabilize faster this phenomenon agrees well with the assumption of dnv method lehane et al 2005 the dnv method is derived from the conventional p y curve which is more applicable to long flexible piles the monopiles used on offshore wind turbines typically have large diameters and relatively smaller driven lengths therefore the shear force acting on the pile tip should be considered prasad and chari 1999 revised the p y curve and developed a theoretical method in calculating the ultimate lateral capacity of the short rigid pile by initially determining the rotation point expressing as 5 x 5 307 l 2 7 29 e 2 10 541 e l 0 5 0 567 l 2 7 e 2 1996 f u l t 0 24 10 1 3 tan φ 0 3 γ x d p 2 7 x 1 7 l for rigid pile where fult denotes ultimate pile bearing x is the rotation point along the pile length l is the pile driven length e is the eccentricity dp is the pile diameter γ is the soil effective unit weight and φ is the soil friction angle the calculated ultimate lateral capacity of the monopiles are listed in table 8 the dnv method is closer to the test results which is suggested to be used in the following analysis the wheel introduces prestress to the underlying soil and hence the earth pressure acting on the embedded pile length is enhanced the improvement of soil character is not considered in the analysis the maximum lateral resistance of the single wheel is assessed through the dnv standard in designing the gravity foundation firstly the terzaghi s bearing capacity equation is used to calculate the vertical bearing capacity of a foundation with a horizontal base resting on the soil surface moreover an additional bearing capacity calculation is carried out in the case of extremely eccentric loading the bearing capacity is determined as the smaller value resulting from the two calculations a safety factor of 1 2 is suggested in the shallow foundation design 6 f u l t q n q 0 5 γ b e f f n r f u l t γ b e f f n r p max 1 2 f u l t where nq and nr denote the bearing capacity factors and the values are related to the soil internal friction angle q is the uniform surcharge that replaces the weight of soil above the base of the footing γ is the soil effective unit weight and beff is the effective wheel width that related to the eccentricity this vertical bearing capacity is the first failure criteria for designing the gravity foundation in the analysis the loading point of the lateral load is recognized as a large eccentricity according to the wheel diameter the lateral capacity is applied to calculate the transformed eccentricity used in the calculation afterward the vertical stress acting on the underlying soil can be calculated which should be smaller than the vertical bearing capacity besides the sliding resistance is considered as the wheels are subjected to lateral loading expressing as 7 h r v tan φ where r is the roughness parameter that describes the character of the soil structure interface and the value is suggested to be 0 3 for the aluminum sand interface navy 1986 uesugi and kishida 1986 v is the total vertical load and φ is the soil friction angle the ultimate lateral capacity of the single wheels is listed in table 9 the calculated results reach good agreements at small diameters and differences become more significant as the diameter increases meanwhile the difference is more obvious when changing the wheel thickness the analytical method is more sensitive to the wheel diameter changing the wheel thickness does not bring significant influences to the lateral capacity in the calculation but the tests did show differences attention should be paid when the gravity foundations share the same base area but variable thicknesses the single wheel and the hybrid foundation illustrate different failure modes under lateral loadings with the high m h ratio the hybrid monopile foundation tends to demonstrate rotation and translation while the single wheel is more likely to slide yang et al 2019 the effect of the eccentricity becomes more pronounced when the diameter of the wheel increases the dnv method described here provides a possible solution in calculating the ultimate lateral capacity of the hybrid monopile foundation however the interaction between the pile and the wheel may not be replicated therefore the scale factor is introduced in the following section to overcome this bias the ultimate lateral capacity of the hybrid monopile foundation is assessed by scaling the addition of the lateral pile capacity and the single wheel lateral capacity the dimensionless scale factors are listed in table 10 which are determined as ratios of the lateral capacity of the hybrid foundations to the add up results in most cases the wheel and the pile have positive interactions which enhance the lateral capacity of each component the capacity of the hybrid foundation system is around or greater than the sum of the individual capacities of the monopile and the single wheel the tensile resistance of the monopile enlarges the effective area of the wheel when comparing to the wheel on its own meanwhile the wheel is able to reduce the moment that is transferred to the monopile therefore the hybrid foundation demonstrates a higher capacity in resisting lateral loadings to summarize a design chart for the hybrid foundation the scale factor is firstly plotted against the pile length in fig 18 there is no significant change in the scale factor when the pile length increases on the contrary the scale factor presents an obvious improvement with the wheel dimension as shown in fig 19 the scale factors are fitted linearly with the wheel diameter and the wheel thickness typically the thickness brings more significant enhancement for the factors as the increase of wheel diameter the restoring moment provided by the wheel is improved and the interaction between the wheel and the pile is more effective for smaller wheel diameters of 3 m and 4 m the scale factors are below one in some cases however the scale factors turn to be larger than 1 when the wheel diameter is larger than 5 m for a small wheel thickness of 0 475 m the scale factors are much smaller than 1 indicating the two components are not fully interacted the connection between the wheel and the pile is contact without fixity at larger thickness the contacting area of the two parts is greater leading to a more effective load transferring mechanism therefore the scale factors increase significantly at 3t thickness the design chart of the scale factor is plotted in a 3d manner in fig 20 in the design phase of an offshore wind turbine the dimension of the foundation is firstly assumed according to preliminary calculations after which this scheme is checked with the ultimate lateral capacity and the deformation in the design of a hybrid monopile foundation the bearing capacities of the monopile and the single wheel are initially calculated by the dnv method as described ahead and the scale factor is determined according to fig 20 afterward the lateral capacity of the hybrid monopile foundation is assessed dimensions of the foundation are modified according to the lateral capacity until the closest result this method is an effective analytical calculation by using the traditional theory in solving new problems and accelerates the design of this innovative hybrid monopile foundation in the analysis the modified p y curve and the design chart relate to the stiffness of the hybrid monopile foundation in the soil the cracking of a too long horizontal concrete plate is reported and buckling of a bucket foundation happens a 5 mw enercon turbine at wilhelmshaven germany bakmar et al 2009 hayward et al 2000 the stiffness of the hybrid monopile foundation changes with the monopile deflections arshi and stone 2015a stone et al 2010 the relative stiffness of the pile and plate is to be considered in practical designs 6 conclusions in this study the parametric study of the hybrid monopile foundation in cohesionless soil has been performed a series of centrifuge tests are conducted by considering the effect of pile lengths wheel diameters and wheel thicknesses these influence factors are carefully assessed and the design suggestions are provided the hybrid monopile foundation is compared with traditional foundations to illustrate the improvement the analytical methods are proposed to estimate the lateral capacity of the new foundation by using traditional design methods the design chart of scale factors is summarized against the influence factors the following conclusions are drawn from this study 1 the hybrid monopile foundation demonstrates a larger lateral bearing capacity compared to the monopile or the single wheel the hybrid monopile is transferring from the wheel bearing to the pile bearing during lateral loadings 2 the failure mode of the hybrid monopile includes rotation and translation the pile and the wheel work systematically to resist the external loadings the total capacity is not an algebraic result of the two components 3 the lateral capacity of the hybrid monopile increases with the wheel diameter and tends to accelerate the capacity increases linearly with the wheel thickness increasing the wheel diameter brings more significant improvements than enhancing the wheel thickness 4 the lateral capacity increases linearly with the pile length this improvement is more pronounced when the wheel diameter is smaller than 7 m 5 the behavior of the hybrid monopile foundation is normalized with the monopile the enhancement is more significant at small pile length the hybrid monopile is an effective design in limiting the continuous increase of the pile length 6 the hybrid monopile is normalized against the single wheel the improvement increases with pile length and tends to decelerate the wheel diameter is not suggested to increase continuously 7 an analytical method is proposed to design the hybrid monopile foundation by scaling the sum of the individual capacities of the monopile and the single wheel the scale factors are suggested by considering the foundation dimensions the method

offshore wind turbine parametric study hybrid monopile foundation 1 introduction renewable energy attracts massive amounts of attention in recent years to achieve the goal of lower carbon emissions and longer energy service lives switching conventional energy resources to renewable energy is beneficial for the environment and the economy petrakopoulou 2016 wind energy is one of the most promising renewable energy resources being plentiful widely distributed and clean has been utilized extensively li et al 2018 by the end of 2019 the global cumulative installed wind capacity is 651 gw with an increase of 17 comparing to 2018 gwec 2020 notably the offshore wind shows promise due to the faster wind speed and lower disturbance to human lives consequently more attention has been moved to offshore wind farms comparing to the onshore counterpart the offshore wind has 1 2 2 times faster wind speed in open sea areas the electrical output is expected to be 1 7 times for the same wind turbine and the energy yield tends to be more efficient by going further from coastlines kaldellis et al 2016 li and yu 2017 in europe the offshore wind contributes 45 of the total installed wind capacity there is 3 6 gw of new capacity connected to the grid in 2019 which is 1 3 times the capacity in 2018 besides the increasing capacity the average water depth and distance to land for the newly installed offshore wind turbines owts are 33 m and 59 km which are more than 2 times and 4 times of those in 2009 windeurope 2020 these revolutions will further complex the environmental condition of the offshore wind site and the transportation and installation processes will face more challenges therefore investigations of the bearing behavior of the owt under variable loading conditions are necessary the outcome will fulfill the higher requirements for the new generation of the offshore wind industry the total cost of an offshore wind project is 30 50 higher than the onshore wind project snyder and kaiser 2009 among which the cost for the foundation design construction and installation accounts for as much as 35 of the capital cost byrne and houlsby 2006 meanwhile the foundation part has a great potential in cost reductions with the potential of being 6 less by introducing innovative techniques by 2020 oxford 2015 owts are light weight structures and they come as clusters the foundation connects with the seabed directly the installation cost of the support structure is 60 of the total cost for installing the whole wind turbine estate 2012 therefore a reliable and efficient foundation is preferable for the offshore wind industry and a single design with the potential of mass production is necessary each type of offshore wind foundation has its advantages and limitations the selection of foundation type is according to the geotechnical investigation turbine capacity and site environmental condition koh and ng 2016 sun et al 2012 most of the existing owts are supported by fixed foundations with a water depth of less than 30 m and the floating foundation is under development in order to adapt for deeper water oxford 2015 sun et al 2012 the typical types of offshore wind turbine foundations are schematically plotted in fig 1 wang et al 2018b currently the most widely used support structure for owt is the monopile foundation in europe there are 4258 monopile supported owts accounting for 81 of the total market share by 2019 windeurope 2020 the monopile foundation is a large diameter pipe pile and 40 50 of the total length is driven into the seabed to provide vertical and lateral resistances kaiser and snyder 2010 zhixin et al 2009 the manufacture and construction technique are relatively mature however the pile diameter will turn to be very large by moving into more immense water depth the material and installation cost will increase significantly pérez collazo et al 2015 the gravity foundation is another popular shallow foundation which accounts for 5 7 of the market share in europe with a total number of 301 windeurope 2020 the gravity base provides resistances by its self weight and it is fabricated by reinforced concrete with ballasts the seabed preparation is necessary during the installation although the materials and constructions are less expensive than the monopile foundation the installation cost is a significant concern the gravity base is used at the offshore sites that the pile is not easy to drive vølund 2005 in the relatively more significant water depth the jacket foundation is used by 2017 468 jacket foundations have been installed to support owts in europe contributing to 8 9 of the total market share windeurope 2020 the jacket foundation is designed with a lattice truss that has three or four tubular steel legs and this concept has been used initially as the offshore platform foundation koh and ng 2016 the adaptable water depth is expended to up to 80 m but the increasing cost for construction and installation is the main limitation for practical applications pérez collazo et al 2015 the suction bucket foundation has been investigated by several researchers currently fu et al 2017 2020 sun et al 2020 xiao et al 2019 an upside down bucket is inserted into the seabed with the aid of its self weight and suction which significantly accelerates the installation saving time and costs zhang et al 2015 2016 this novel concept is originally used as anchors for offshore oil gas platforms and it is believed to be an effective alternative for owts guo et al 2011 however the application of the suction bucket foundation is significantly limited by the water depth and soil conditions the traditional foundations for offshore wind turbines have their advantages and limitations considering the current requirements of the offshore wind industry innovative foundations are investigated with wider adaptability focuses are put on the enhancement of traditional monopiles bienen et al 2012 li et al 2020a the hybrid monopile foundation combining the traditional monopile and the gravity base is investigated in this study fig 2 this concept is initialized by the pile caps and the embedded retaining wall with a stabilizing platform mokwa and duncan 2003 powrie and daly 2007 zhou et al 2011 a friction wheel is added at the seabed to reinforce the underlying soil and provide an additional restoring moment to the monopile the friction force under the wheel is capable of reducing the lateral movement of the foundation during the external loadings the earth pressure acting on the embedded part of the wheel provides extra lateral resistances meanwhile the relative scour depth is reduced since the wheel enlarges the contacting area between the foundation and the seabed soil liang et al 2019 qi and gao 2019 wang et al 2017 2018c which is beneficial for minimizing the scour failure the design of the hybrid monopile foundation can learn from the established standard for monopile and gravity base which accelerates the investigation of this innovative concept several studies have been conducted to investigate the performance of the hybrid monopile foundation lehane et al 2014 examined the improved bearing capacity of a monopile foundation that combined with a footing in the centrifuge it was demonstrated that the tension capacity of the pile leads to a larger effective area of the footing and the footing brought a more significant resisting moment to the monopile arshi et al arshi and stone 2015b investigated the lateral resistance improvement of the monopile foundation by adding a footing the lab test and the numerical simulation were conducted and it was illustrated that the pile diameter and the wheel diameter were critical factors in influencing the foundation response stone et al 2018 conducted a series of centrifuge tests to examine the lateral capacity as well as the vertical bearing capacity of the hybrid monopiled footing the lateral response of the hybrid foundation is influenced by the pile plate dimension and the prestress on the plate the coupled and uncoupled hybrid systems demonstrated different failure mechanisms during external loads the feasibility study of the hybrid monopile foundation was conducted in our laboratory and the behavior of the hybrid monopile foundation for offshore wind turbines was checked both under static and cyclic loading conditions wang et al 2018a yang et al 2018 the initial design chart had been summarized the hybrid monopile foundation is a new concept the above mentioned studies put more focuses on studying the mechanism of the foundation and the parametric study has not been reported it is necessary to investigate the influence factors in order to provide design reference and booster the application of the foundation in this study a set of hybrid monopile foundations is a design by considering the influence of pile length wheel diameter and wheel thickness the parametric study is performed in cohesionless soil the models are tested in the centrifuge to check their improved performances the results are compared with the original monopile and the wheel foundation the study aims to provide well documented test data for practical designs the theoretical calculations are conducted and checked with the centrifuge tests the design chart of the hybrid monopile foundation is suggested 2 centrifuge testing program a set of centrifuge tests was conducted to investigate the bearing behavior of the hybrid monopile foundation and the focus is to gain insights into the effect of the influence factors the centrifuge tests were conducted on the geotechnical centrifuge at case western reserve university figueroa et al 1998 the centrifuge test is a reliable experimental method in studying geotechnical problems hong et al 2017 the stress state of soil is more similar to the field condition by testing the small scale models under larger gravitational levels the maximum acceleration was 50 g in this study all the data presented in the following sections are in the prototype scale data interpretations are according to centrifuge scaling law chandrasekaran 2003 the centrifuge testing program is summarized in table 1 a total number of twenty seven hybrid monopile foundations were tested the parametric study includes factors of wheel diameter wheel thickness and pile length diameters of the wheels dw are 3 m 4 m 5 m and 7 m the thicknesses of the wheels t are 0 475 m 0 95 m and 1 425 m the pile diameter dp is 1 1 m embedded pile lengths l are 1 1 m 3 3 m and 5 5 m leading to l dp ratios of 1 5 the model pile and the model plate are fabricated from aluminum rods and aluminum plates with an ultimate tensile strength of 124 mpa and a yield strength of 55 2 mpa in all cases the stiffness of the pile and the plate are considered to respond rigidly the test id is represented by four parts the first part is the foundation type besides the hybrid monopile the traditional monopile foundation and the wheel foundation are tested for comparisons the second and third part is the wheel diameter and wheel thickness which are represented by d and t respectively the last section illustrates the pile length for example the h d3 2t l1 represents the hybrid monopile foundation with a wheel diameter of 3 m and a thickness of 0 95 m and the pile length is 1 1 m l dp 1 the rest models are depicted in fig 3 the models share the same upper structure the wind tower is fabricated by a steel rod and the tower head is simplified as a lumped mass the model is designed according to a 3 mw offshore wind turbine located with an aspect ratio of 1 10 ding et al 2015 the centrifuge tests were performed in the saturated silica sand li et al 2019 the critical mechanical properties of the silica sand are listed in table 2 the silica sand was oven dried for 24 h after which the dry sand was air alleviated into the rigid container with a constant falling height in the centrifuge slight compaction is applied to acquire the desire relative density the rigid container has a length of 26 6 m a width of 12 m and a depth of 8 9 m the de air water was instilled from the bottom of the container slowly and the vacuum was on for at least 24 h to achieve full saturation the silica sand has a relatively smaller particle size which is useful for minimizing the scale effect under higher gravitational levels meanwhile scaling down the soil particle size is beneficial for reducing the soil permeability which overcomes the larger flow rate referring to the centrifuge scaling law de nicola and randolph 1997 qi et al 2016 according to the kozeny carman equation the permeability of the silica sand was 5 85 10 4 m s carman 1937 the silica sand has the advantage of maintaining its internal friction angle for examining the bearing capacity the internal friction angle was measured using the direct shear test which was 33 4 the relative density of the soil deposit was 70 before the tests being classified as dense sand and the unit weight was 5 7 kn m3 the soil parameters were carefully measured before and after the tests astm 2006 wang et al 2019 the testing soil was re prepared with the same procedure for each centrifuge test for the identification the testing models were installed by jacking under the 1 g gravitational level the centrifuge tests lead to relatively smaller results since the 1 g installation will increase the lateral stress of soil that acting on the foundation under higher gravitational levels this increment is overcome by the higher effective stress randolph et al 1992 the diameter of the monopile is the same with the center hole of the wheel and these two parts are assembled without fixity the vertical sliding is allowed between the pile and the wheel during the external loading however the plate is not assumed to be free to move vertically it has been demonstrated that the hybrid system tends to provide a larger bearing capacity when the slight relative sliding occurs the effective area between the wheel and the soil is more significant due to the rotation of the wheel arshi et al 2013 the interface between the wheel and the monopile was greased in our previous study in order to reduce the friction and no significant difference was observed in the bearing behavior yang et al 2018 therefore the change in joint stiffness is not considered in this study the centrifuge tests are load controlled a simplified single linear load was applied by an actuator fixed on the wind tower in the centrifuge tests the loading point is 2 5 m above the mud line representing the combined effects of wind wave and ice etc the lateral load increased from 0 to 1000 kn linearly in 200s monotonically as demonstrated in fig 4 the wind turbine models were loaded to failure referring to the extreme condition the lateral displacements were recorded by an lvdt that was fixed at the same level as the actuator as depicted in fig 5 details of the loading system and the sensor system are described previously wang et al 2018a 3 test results and interpretations 3 1 wheel with different diameters the typical load displacement curves recorded in the centrifuge tests are depicted using the prototype scale in fig 6 the lateral displacement is measured at the actuator level the hybrid monopile foundations with the same pile length but different diameters are plotted together for comparisons the traditional monopiles are also tested and plotted by categorizing the pile length the tests with a pile length equal to zero represent the wheel foundations which are depicted in fig 6d the lateral bearing capacity of the hybrid monopile foundations is clearly larger than the single pile the lateral stiffness of the hybrid foundations is also enhanced especially for hybrid models with larger diameters the phenomenon demonstrates that the wheel contributes significant overall stiffness to the hybrid foundation system moreover the ultimate lateral capacity of the single wheel foundations is smaller compared to the hybrid foundations and the final displacements corresponded to the failure loads are smaller consequently the hybrid monopile foundation is feasible to enhance the capability of traditional foundations the load displacement curves show slight differences between the hybrid foundations and the monopiles the hybrid foundations illustrate platforms on the initial rising sections after which the curves continue increasing with large gradients and reach plateau finally the platform indicates the load transfer mechanism of the hybrid foundation at the initial linear stage the wheel contributes the majority of the lateral bearing capacity the load resistance of the wheel increases rapidly and reaches a plateau at a small lateral deflection afterward the sharing factor of the pile part increases with the continuous development of the lateral deflection exceeding the wheel part quickly the platform represents the transformation from wheel bearing to pile bearing during the external load wang et al 2018a on the contrary the curve of the monopile foundation is much smoother several methods have been proposed to determine the lateral bearing capacity from the load displacement relationship it is demonstrated that the lateral bearing capacity and the initial lateral stiffness of the hybrid monopile foundation increase significantly with the wheel diameter the curves yield gradually as they start from small elastic deformations and transfer to large plastic deformations finally the lateral bearing capacity is extracted at the maximum curvature point mcdowell 2002 the intersection of the two lines that fitted from the beginning and end of the curve is also suggested by graham graham et al 1982 byrne byrne et al 2003 determines the ultimate lateral capacity at the significant changing point which is realized by plotting the displacement rate curve however it is hard to define the changing point by the above criteria since the load transfer mechanism is slightly different for the hybrid monopile foundation meanwhile a rotation angle of 5 representing for the ultimate limit state uls is suggested to identify the ultimate lateral capacity dnv 2016 another lvdt is attached on the wind tower to record the rotation angle li et al 2020b the lateral load is plotted against the rotation angle in fig 7 for the hybrid foundations with a pile length of 5 5 m the maximum angle recorded in the centrifuge test is smaller than 5 due to the recording range of the lvdt in many cases the ultimate lateral capacity is extracted as the maximum load recorded in the test and this method is used by several researchers previously achmus et al 2013 villalobos jara 2006 during the centrifuge tests the hybrid foundation models are loaded to fail with a relatively large input load of 1000 kn the test results demonstrate that the models do fail before this peak value representing the maximum lateral load that they can sustain as a consequence the ultimate lateral capacity is identified as the peak value on the load displacement curves which are listed in table 3 3 2 wheel with different thicknesses the hybrid monopile foundations with the same pile length but different thicknesses are plotted in fig 8 the lateral bearing capacity increases with the increment of the wheel thickness table 4 however the enhancement of the initial stiffness is not that significant as the wheel diameter especially for the wheels with small thicknesses the wheels in this set of hybrid foundation systems share the same diameter so that their soil contacting areas are identical the different thicknesses introduce a set of different gravities representing different prestress acting on the underlying soil it is observed in the figures that for the single wheel foundations the maximum lateral deflections corresponded to failures are smaller than the hybrid foundations the single wheel foundation is similar to the gravity foundation and the main failure mode is the lateral deflection yang et al 2019 without the pile the wheel is not able to resist the large overturning moment and the friction force acting on the soil wheel interaction mainly contributes to resisting the lateral displacement fig 9 presents a picture of the testing model took after stopping the centrifuge h d5 t l1 which reveals the failure mode of the hybrid monopile foundation the hybrid foundation behaves like a rigid body for this high m h ratio since the pile length is relatively small the soil heave in front of the wheel is observed the front part of the wheel embeds into the soil to some depths and the rear part tends to separate with the underlying soil these observations indicate that both the rotation and translation occur during the lateral loading this phenomenon is observed for similar hybrid foundations reported previously chen et al 2020 yang et al 2019 with the rotational tendency of the wheel the vertical stress developing under the front side of the wheel reduces the bending moment being transferred to the pile the passive earth pressure acting on the embedded part of the wheel further increases the resistance capability pedram 2015 the lateral deflection is mainly caused by the pile rotation and soil deformation under the external loading and the wheel is not likely to slide too much the friction at the interface of the wheel and the soil is pronounced and the rotation center of the wheel almost remains at its original position yang et al 2018 the hybrid monopile foundation is not a simple algebraic summation of the wheel and the pile these two parts work systematically to resist lateral loading wang et al 2018a 4 influence factors of the hybrid monopile foundation according to the centrifuge tests the addition of the friction wheel significantly enhances the lateral bearing performance of the hybrid foundation system parametric studies of foundation dimensions are conducted aiming to assess the influence of foundation geometry on the overall lateral bearing behavior the analysis is expected to provide references for optimized design during the application step the diameter of the wheel ranges from 3 m to 7 m and the wheel thickness remains the same 2t in this set of tests the ultimate bearing capacities are plotted against the wheel diameter in fig 10 it is illustrated that the longer pile length leads to a larger capacity moreover the ultimate lateral capacity increases with the wheel diameter and tends to accelerate the relationships are fitted by a series of power curves as shown in fig 9 and the equation is expressed as 1 f u l t a b d w the values of a and b are listed in table 5 by increasing the wheel diameter the underlying soil is compressed more leading to higher effective stress of soil the lateral earth pressure profile along the pile length is different since the distribution of vertical stress is enhanced by the circularly loaded area at the soil surface meanwhile the restoring moment provided by the wheel increases due to the larger rotation arm resulting in better stability these two factors work simultaneously and contribute to the improved lateral bearing capacity of the hybrid foundation system the improvement is pronounced with a wheel diameter larger than 3 m which is almost half of the longest pile length a similar observation was reported previously indicating that the optimal width of a stabilizing base in a foundation system is not less than 50 of the embedment depth of the wall powrie and chandler 1998 however the larger wheel diameter leads to a longer drainage path wang et al 2020 which brings a negative effect on the buildup of the excess pore water pressure the centrifuge tests are loaded slowly to simulate the pseudo static situation and hence the change of pore water pressure is not considered in this study the maximum wheel diameter is limited to 10dp in the current design and hence the validity range of dw in eq 1 is 0 to 10dp the second parameter considered is the wheel thickness a series of hybrid monopile foundations are designed with the same diameter of 5 m and varying thicknesses ranging from t to 3t t 0 475 m the wheels share the same contacting area with the underlying soil and their self weights increase sequentially capacity thickness relationships are depicted in fig 11 the lateral bearing capacity of the hybrid foundation system improves linearly with the wheel thickness being expressed as 2 f u l t a t b the values of a and b are listed in table 6 the intercept b represents the capacity of the monopile foundation since the wheel thickness is 0 the slope increases with the pile length representing the influence of wheel thickness tends to be more significant as the pile length increases the thicker wheels provide larger prestress to the underlying soil so that the effective earth pressure is enhanced and the friction at the soil surface is larger however with a unique wheel diameter the restoring moment could not be improved so significant as the wheel diameter the wheel thickness is limited to 0 5dp in the current design the bearing capacities are plotted against the relative length of the pile in fig 12 the capacity increases linearly with the pile length as expected which is expressed as 3 f u l t a l d p b the values of a and b are listed in table 7 for the wheels with the same thickness the influence of the pile length tends to be more intense when the wheel diameter is smaller than 5 m afterward the effect of extending the pile length weakens the wheel and the pile work together to provide the lateral resistance and the function of the wheel becomes predominant when its diameter increases continuously therefore the diameter of the wheel is suggested to be no larger than 5 m for optimizing the foundation system for the wheels with the same diameter slopes of the curves increase with the thickness functions of the influence factors including the wheel diameter the wheel thickness and the pile length are discussed in this section in summary the ultimate lateral capacity of the hybrid monopile foundation illustrates improvement with the increase of these geometric factors the enhancement is more significant when increasing the wheel diameter and slopes of the curves accelerate the larger gravity and the larger rotation arm contribute to these enhancements simultaneously therefore enlarging the wheel diameter is the most efficient way to optimize the performance of the hybrid foundation besides the foundation dimensions the eccentricity is a key factor for assessing the ultimate lateral capacity of the hybrid foundations chen et al 2020 a numerical analysis is carried out to study the influence of eccentricity using abaqus the numerical models are built according to the hybrid foundation h d5 2t with load eccentricities varying from 1 m to 5 m the foundations are assumed to be wish in place and the installation process is ignored the properties and geometry of the soil is equivalent to the centrifuge tests the soil domain and a typical finite element mesh is presented in fig 13 the 3 dimensional 8 node linear brick elements c3d8r are used in the models and the interactions are simulated by normal hard contact model the numerical model is verified against the centrifuge test fig 14 depicts the load displacement relationships of h d5 2t in various load eccentricities the ultimate lateral capacity decreases with the increase of the loading point and the influence tends to be less significant at larger eccentricities 5 analysis the hybrid monopile foundation is a system that integrates the monopile foundation and the gravity foundation the analytical methods are relatively mature for these two types of traditional foundations these methods can be used for establishing the theoretical calculation method for the hybrid monopile firstly improvements of the hybrid foundations are demonstrated by normalizing their ultimate bearing capacities with capacities of the corresponded monopiles the results are plotted against the wheel diameter or the wheel thickness in fig 15 the improvement factors increase with the wheel diameter and the wheel thickness obviously the improvement is significant when the pile length is small and the ultimate lateral capacity could be around 100 times of the single pile this improvement tends to weaken when the pile length increases for longer piles the lateral bearing capacity is relatively large and hence the addition of the wheel does not show pronounced effects practically the pile may be driven into the bedrock to obtain the desired capacity but the cost will increase significantly the hybrid monopile demonstrates its advantages for these cases the pile length is limited in the soil layer and the wheel is installed on the soil surface to provide additional lateral bearing capacity therefore to gain the lateral bearing capacity of the hybrid system the pile length is not suggested to increase continuously since the improvement decelerates secondly the ultimate lateral capacities of the hybrid monopiles are normalized with the capacities of the single wheel foundations the normalized results are plotted in fig 16 these normalizations demonstrate the improvement between the hybrid monopile and the gravity foundation for each hybrid foundation the improvement factor increases with the pile length and tends to decelerate the hybrid foundations demonstrate a similar enhancement when the wheel diameter is smaller than 7 m afterward the effects of adding the pile weaken significantly meanwhile the effect weakens with the increase of the wheel thickness therefore it is suggested to set limitations for the wheel diameter and the wheel thickness in the hybrid foundation system the continuous increase of the wheel size is not good for optimal design the improvement factor is larger when adding the wheel to the monopile compared to adding the monopile to the wheel the application of the monopile foundation accounts for more than 87 of the installed wind turbines in europe the hybrid monopile foundation can be an alternative for improving the performance of the existing monopiles the hybrid monopile foundation is effective in enhancing the lateral bearing capacity comparing with the traditional monopile as well as the single wheel foundation it is plausible to predict the capacity of the hybrid foundation according to the summation of these two components firstly the lateral bearing capacity of the monopile foundation is analyzed according to the dnv standard for designing the offshore wind turbine foundation dnv 2016 the interaction between soil and piles is typically calculated by the p y method which has been widely used to interpret the pile behavior the p y curve is developed based on the winkler approach which discretizes the soil into a limited number of independent layers that supported by a series of nonlinear springs along with the embedded depth carswell et al 2015 the relationship between the pile displacement and the pile stress for any external loading at the pile head follows the differential equation as follow 4 e p i p d 4 y d z 4 p y 0 where z denotes the position along with the pile depth y is the lateral displacement of the pile p y is the lateral soil reaction ei is the flexural rigidity of the pile the calculated results of the monopile foundation are plotted together with the centrifuge test results in fig 17 the calculated lateral bearing capacity is conservative at small pile driven lengths and tends to be over estimated at larger penetration depths meanwhile the initial stiffness of the dnv curve is larger than the centrifuge test but the curves tend to stabilize faster this phenomenon agrees well with the assumption of dnv method lehane et al 2005 the dnv method is derived from the conventional p y curve which is more applicable to long flexible piles the monopiles used on offshore wind turbines typically have large diameters and relatively smaller driven lengths therefore the shear force acting on the pile tip should be considered prasad and chari 1999 revised the p y curve and developed a theoretical method in calculating the ultimate lateral capacity of the short rigid pile by initially determining the rotation point expressing as 5 x 5 307 l 2 7 29 e 2 10 541 e l 0 5 0 567 l 2 7 e 2 1996 f u l t 0 24 10 1 3 tan φ 0 3 γ x d p 2 7 x 1 7 l for rigid pile where fult denotes ultimate pile bearing x is the rotation point along the pile length l is the pile driven length e is the eccentricity dp is the pile diameter γ is the soil effective unit weight and φ is the soil friction angle the calculated ultimate lateral capacity of the monopiles are listed in table 8 the dnv method is closer to the test results which is suggested to be used in the following analysis the wheel introduces prestress to the underlying soil and hence the earth pressure acting on the embedded pile length is enhanced the improvement of soil character is not considered in the analysis the maximum lateral resistance of the single wheel is assessed through the dnv standard in designing the gravity foundation firstly the terzaghi s bearing capacity equation is used to calculate the vertical bearing capacity of a foundation with a horizontal base resting on the soil surface moreover an additional bearing capacity calculation is carried out in the case of extremely eccentric loading the bearing capacity is determined as the smaller value resulting from the two calculations a safety factor of 1 2 is suggested in the shallow foundation design 6 f u l t q n q 0 5 γ b e f f n r f u l t γ b e f f n r p max 1 2 f u l t where nq and nr denote the bearing capacity factors and the values are related to the soil internal friction angle q is the uniform surcharge that replaces the weight of soil above the base of the footing γ is the soil effective unit weight and beff is the effective wheel width that related to the eccentricity this vertical bearing capacity is the first failure criteria for designing the gravity foundation in the analysis the loading point of the lateral load is recognized as a large eccentricity according to the wheel diameter the lateral capacity is applied to calculate the transformed eccentricity used in the calculation afterward the vertical stress acting on the underlying soil can be calculated which should be smaller than the vertical bearing capacity besides the sliding resistance is considered as the wheels are subjected to lateral loading expressing as 7 h r v tan φ where r is the roughness parameter that describes the character of the soil structure interface and the value is suggested to be 0 3 for the aluminum sand interface navy 1986 uesugi and kishida 1986 v is the total vertical load and φ is the soil friction angle the ultimate lateral capacity of the single wheels is listed in table 9 the calculated results reach good agreements at small diameters and differences become more significant as the diameter increases meanwhile the difference is more obvious when changing the wheel thickness the analytical method is more sensitive to the wheel diameter changing the wheel thickness does not bring significant influences to the lateral capacity in the calculation but the tests did show differences attention should be paid when the gravity foundations share the same base area but variable thicknesses the single wheel and the hybrid foundation illustrate different failure modes under lateral loadings with the high m h ratio the hybrid monopile foundation tends to demonstrate rotation and translation while the single wheel is more likely to slide yang et al 2019 the effect of the eccentricity becomes more pronounced when the diameter of the wheel increases the dnv method described here provides a possible solution in calculating the ultimate lateral capacity of the hybrid monopile foundation however the interaction between the pile and the wheel may not be replicated therefore the scale factor is introduced in the following section to overcome this bias the ultimate lateral capacity of the hybrid monopile foundation is assessed by scaling the addition of the lateral pile capacity and the single wheel lateral capacity the dimensionless scale factors are listed in table 10 which are determined as ratios of the lateral capacity of the hybrid foundations to the add up results in most cases the wheel and the pile have positive interactions which enhance the lateral capacity of each component the capacity of the hybrid foundation system is around or greater than the sum of the individual capacities of the monopile and the single wheel the tensile resistance of the monopile enlarges the effective area of the wheel when comparing to the wheel on its own meanwhile the wheel is able to reduce the moment that is transferred to the monopile therefore the hybrid foundation demonstrates a higher capacity in resisting lateral loadings to summarize a design chart for the hybrid foundation the scale factor is firstly plotted against the pile length in fig 18 there is no significant change in the scale factor when the pile length increases on the contrary the scale factor presents an obvious improvement with the wheel dimension as shown in fig 19 the scale factors are fitted linearly with the wheel diameter and the wheel thickness typically the thickness brings more significant enhancement for the factors as the increase of wheel diameter the restoring moment provided by the wheel is improved and the interaction between the wheel and the pile is more effective for smaller wheel diameters of 3 m and 4 m the scale factors are below one in some cases however the scale factors turn to be larger than 1 when the wheel diameter is larger than 5 m for a small wheel thickness of 0 475 m the scale factors are much smaller than 1 indicating the two components are not fully interacted the connection between the wheel and the pile is contact without fixity at larger thickness the contacting area of the two parts is greater leading to a more effective load transferring mechanism therefore the scale factors increase significantly at 3t thickness the design chart of the scale factor is plotted in a 3d manner in fig 20 in the design phase of an offshore wind turbine the dimension of the foundation is firstly assumed according to preliminary calculations after which this scheme is checked with the ultimate lateral capacity and the deformation in the design of a hybrid monopile foundation the bearing capacities of the monopile and the single wheel are initially calculated by the dnv method as described ahead and the scale factor is determined according to fig 20 afterward the lateral capacity of the hybrid monopile foundation is assessed dimensions of the foundation are modified according to the lateral capacity until the closest result this method is an effective analytical calculation by using the traditional theory in solving new problems and accelerates the design of this innovative hybrid monopile foundation in the analysis the modified p y curve and the design chart relate to the stiffness of the hybrid monopile foundation in the soil the cracking of a too long horizontal concrete plate is reported and buckling of a bucket foundation happens a 5 mw enercon turbine at wilhelmshaven germany bakmar et al 2009 hayward et al 2000 the stiffness of the hybrid monopile foundation changes with the monopile deflections arshi and stone 2015a stone et al 2010 the relative stiffness of the pile and plate is to be considered in practical designs 6 conclusions in this study the parametric study of the hybrid monopile foundation in cohesionless soil has been performed a series of centrifuge tests are conducted by considering the effect of pile lengths wheel diameters and wheel thicknesses these influence factors are carefully assessed and the design suggestions are provided the hybrid monopile foundation is compared with traditional foundations to illustrate the improvement the analytical methods are proposed to estimate the lateral capacity of the new foundation by using traditional design methods the design chart of scale factors is summarized against the influence factors the following conclusions are drawn from this study 1 the hybrid monopile foundation demonstrates a larger lateral bearing capacity compared to the monopile or the single wheel the hybrid monopile is transferring from the wheel bearing to the pile bearing during lateral loadings 2 the failure mode of the hybrid monopile includes rotation and translation the pile and the wheel work systematically to resist the external loadings the total capacity is not an algebraic result of the two components 3 the lateral capacity of the hybrid monopile increases with the wheel diameter and tends to accelerate the capacity increases linearly with the wheel thickness increasing the wheel diameter brings more significant improvements than enhancing the wheel thickness 4 the lateral capacity increases linearly with the pile length this improvement is more pronounced when the wheel diameter is smaller than 7 m 5 the behavior of the hybrid monopile foundation is normalized with the monopile the enhancement is more significant at small pile length the hybrid monopile is an effective design in limiting the continuous increase of the pile length 6 the hybrid monopile is normalized against the single wheel the improvement increases with pile length and tends to decelerate the wheel diameter is not suggested to increase continuously 7 an analytical method is proposed to design the hybrid monopile foundation by scaling the sum of the individual capacities of the monopile and the single wheel the scale factors are suggested by considering the foundation dimensions the method

21332,two dimensional high order spectral hp computations are carried out for a cylinder undergoing a sinusoidal rotary oscillation about its own axis results are examined for r e 200 and a fixed oscillation amplitude of θ 0 π the study concentrates on a domain of forcing frequencies ranging from 0 to 5 f 0 with f 0 being the natural shedding frequency of the fixed cylinder the drag of the cylinder is measured to reduce by up to 22 at the optimal frequency this drag reduction is expected to result from the appearance of negative pressure in the windward regions of cylinder surface proper orthogonal decomposition pod is then utilized to extract the energetic modes that govern the dynamics of the flow a novel force decomposition technique proposed by miyanawala and jaiman 2019 is reformulated to allow quantification of the time dependent contribution from each mode to the pressure drag such contribution is found to be affected in a manner by the forcing frequency pod is further used to characterize the spatially evolving nature of the forced wake as it undergoes a transition from the near wake two layer shedding pattern to the far wake kármán like shedding pattern it is also found that a few modes suffice to reconstruct the near wake accurately while more modes must be retained to ensure an accurate approximation of the far wake keywords wake dynamics sinusoidal rotary oscillation low reynolds number spectral hp element method 1 introduction flow past bluff bodies subjected to periodic forced motions has been a focus of plentiful investigations in fluid mechanics interest in this class of flows arises not only from the view of understanding underlying diverse flow phenomena but also from its practical significance in predicting vortex induced vibrations and in flow control the external periodic forcing to a bluff body such as a circular cylinder can be realized by several means e g by oscillating cylinder in line with the free stream leontini et al 2011 2013 tang et al 2017 kim and choi 2019 or transverse bishop and hassan 1964 williamson and roshko 1988 blackburn and henderson 1999 carberry et al 2001 leontini et al 2006 kim et al 2014 kumar et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 or a combination thereof jeon and gharib 2001 due to the interaction of velocity fields induced by self excited wake instability and by the externally imposed forcing hydrodynamic forces and wake geometry depend strongly on the forcing parameters this becomes especially prominent for a cylinder when the forcing frequency varies in the vicinity of its natural shedding frequency studies into flow over a cylinder executing rotary oscillations have not been as widely conducted as rectilinear oscillations one of the earliest experiments was carried out by taneda 1978 over the reynolds number range of 30 330 the reynolds number here is defined as r e u d ν where u is the uniform incident velocity d the cylinder diameter and ν the kinematic viscosity he observed that the dead water region as well as vortex shedding process behind a cylinder can be eliminated for sufficiently large forcing frequencies taneda s 1978 results did suggest the potential for effective flow control by utilizing rotary oscillation of cylinders this was subsequently examined by tokumaru and dimotakis 1991 at a moderate reynolds number of 15000 they found such a control mechanism can achieve a significant drag reduction 80 for optimal forcing parameters also four distinct vortex wake modes were identified according to different regimes of vortex shedding and the length of the synchronization region shiels and leonard 2001 via two dimensional numerical simulations over a wide range of reynolds numbers from 150 to 15000 confirmed the tokumaru and dimotakis s 1991 observation of remarkable decrease in drag at higher reynolds numbers but it was found the forcing is ineffective for drag reduction at lower reynolds numbers a similar finding was made by choi et al 2002 who simulated two dimensional flow past a sinusoidally rotating cylinder at r e 1000 and 100 and showed that the amount of mean drag reduction drops from 60 to 12 these results expressly indicate that the efficacy of this control is reynolds number dependent thiria et al 2006 for the first time performed direct experimental drag measurements for a rotationally oscillating cylinder at a lower reynolds number of 150 the global variation of drag coefficient with the forcing frequency exhibits a sharp maximum and a wide minimum the locations of which are generally subject to the velocity amplitude the ratio of peak cylinder surface velocity to free stream velocity on the basis of impulse formula saffman 1992 the drag coefficient was further associated with the wake pattern which shows a high degree of consistency of significant interest is the exploration of the underlying physical mechanisms responsible for drag reduction for cases with appropriate rotational oscillations shiels and leonard 2001 noticed a bursting event in the boundary layer which leads to the formation of a multipole vorticity structure the interaction of these vortex multipoles results in a time averaged delay in separation and thus leads to drag reduction protas and wesfreid 2002 in their numerical study at r e 150 intrinsically related the modification of drag to the mean flow correction through the action of the divergence of the reynolds stress tensor of the forced flow detailed scrutiny revealed that the mean drag reduction occurs when the control drives the mean flow towards the unstable symmetric state the basic flow i e when the drag of the mean flow correction is driven to close to zero with the aid of energy based receptivity analysis sengupta et al 2003 bhumkar and sengupta 2009 have shown that triplets of disturbance energy sinks and a source exist in the wake of a harmonically rotating cylinder compared to lower reynolds numbers such structures are much smaller in size and less coherent at higher reynolds numbers but are prone to a better performance on drag reduction wake structures behind a rotary oscillating cylinder display complicated spatio temporal evolutions and diverse set of vortex shedding modes can be identified with the variation of the forcing parameters mittal et al 2017 gao et al 2018 a candidate for the analysis of this type of flow is the proper orthogonal decomposition pod since its introduction to fluid dynamics by lumley 1967 1970 and sirovich 1987 pod also known by many different names in different disciplines e g principal component analysis empirical component analysis karhunen loève decomposition has been a well developed method for identifying the organized structures from the flow data the pod technique determines a subspace that optimally represents a given dataset in a least squares sense this involves decomposing a set of physical field data either numerical or experimental into a minimal number of spatially orthogonal modes based on the energy ranking with only a finite series of the most energetic modes a low dimensional description of the system s dynamics can be readily realized a great many applications of pod to unveil the large scale structures in the wake are primarily focused on flow past stationary bodies muld et al 2012 deri et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 or on freely vibrating bodies huera huarte and vernet 2010 cagney and balabani 2013 riches et al 2018 miyanawala and jaiman 2019 however to the authors knowledge except the work of bergmann et al 2005 bergmann and cordier 2006 very few literatures have applied it to forced oscillation problems whether to rectilinear or rotary oscillations the initial motivation for the current study was to present a pod analysis of the wake behind a cylinder in rotary oscillating motion in particular we wish to quantify the contribution from each pod mode to the drag force and characterize how this contribution varies as a function of the frequency ratio the outline of this paper is as follows the problem definition and the non dimensional parameters are introduced in section 2 in section 3 we provide details of the numerical methods used in the dns and pod and discuss various computational details as well as the convergence tests and validations the main results are presented and analyzed in section 4 first the effects of varying frequency ratio on mean flow quantities are explored section 4 1 subsequently a pod analysis in terms of the fluctuating pressure field is provided section 4 2 then the spatially evolving character of the wake is studied and the associated pod modes are described section 4 3 finally section 5 summarizes the main findings of this paper 2 problem definition we are interested in a two dimensional circular cylinder immersed in a free stream undergoing a sinusoidal rotary oscillation about its axis in the form of 1 θ θ 0 sin 2 π f f t where θ is the angular position of the cylinder θ 0 is the oscillation amplitude and f f is the forcing frequency a schematic diagram of the problem under consideration is shown in fig 1 the velocity amplitude a adopted by the majority of studies can be related to the oscillation amplitude used in the present work by the following transformation 2 a π f f θ 0 d u our primary characterization of results is made for a single oscillation amplitude θ 0 π at a fixed reynolds number of r e 200 and with a wide range of frequency ratios f r f f f 0 ranging from 0 to 5 in steps of 0 2 we define f 0 as the natural shedding frequency of the fixed cylinder and the frequencies in this paper are all normalized by f 0 a word of explanation is needed regarding the applicability of two dimensional results for the current configuration although flow past a fixed cylinder at r e 200 is at the onset of three dimensionality the rotary oscillation of the cylinder is expected to impose strong two dimensionality on the wake this issue has been studied by poncet 2002 who showed that even at higher reynolds number of 500 forcing the cylinder with high enough amplitude θ 0 π 2 can suppress the mode b instability and make the flow nominally two dimensional furthermore sengupta and patidar 2018 found that for flow behind a sinusoidally rotating cylinder the reynolds number for the onset of three dimensional instabilities is far higher than its fixed cylinder counterpart therefore it can be concluded from these studies that the flow considered in the present study is safely within the two dimensional regime 3 numerical methodology 3 1 direct numerical simulation dns we consider a two dimensional incompressible viscous flow which is governed by the navier stokes equations the non dimensional form of the equations can be written as 3 u t u u p 1 r e 2 u 4 u 0 here u u v is the velocity vector field p the static pressure and r e the reynolds number the pressure is assumed to be scaled by the constant fluid density ρ the spatial discretization of these equations was achieved using highly accurate spectral h p element method karniadakis and sherwin 2013 which combines the geometric flexibility of classical linear finite element methods with the attractive convergence properties of spectral methods spectral h p element method allows the solution to be refined either by increasing the number of elements h refinement or the order of the polynomial expansions p in each element p refinement the equations were then solved through second order time integration using a stiffly stable splitting scheme karniadakis et al 1991 guermond and shen 2003 a spectral h p element navier stokes solver encapsulated within nektar cantwell et al 2015 xu et al 2018 moxey et al 2019 was employed to perform all numerical simulations below the spatial discretization in the x y plane was comprised of a mesh with 2983 spectral elements shown in fig 2 with both the solution and the geometry represented by sixth order modified lagrange polynomials inside each element this mesh extended 50 d downstream and 30 d upstream above and below the cylinder which means the blockage is restricted to 1 67 free stream dirichlet boundary conditions u u 0 were set at the inlet and the lateral boundaries and a no slip condition set on the cylinder surface at the downstream or outflow boundary the zero normal gradient condition u n 0 where n is the normal unit vector was imposed for the pressure except for the outflow with a fixed value of p 0 a high order neumann condition was used at all boundaries karniadakis et al 1991 depending on the forcing frequency a non dimensional time step varying from 5 1 0 4 to 1 1 0 3 was used and the integration in time was second order accurate for each forcing frequency the simulations were performed for some time after transients have died out and the saturated state has been reached so that converged statistics can be obtained 3 2 proper orthogonal decomposition the present study incorporates the pod algorithm to describe the spatio temporal variations of wake characteristics behind a rotationally oscillating cylinder for handling numerical data where the product of numbers of grid points along the coordinate directions n x n y is generally larger than the number of data snapshots n the so called s n a p s h o t p o d by sirovich 1987 is most appropriate and efficient for the sake of completeness the basic algorithm to extract proper orthogonal modes is briefly recapitulated as follows here each instantaneous flow field i e the snapshot is expressed as a column vector

convergence test was conducted for the macro element mesh by varying the order of the polynomial expansion p within each element simulations were performed for a rotationally oscillating cylinder at r e 200 with θ 0 π and f r 5 this case corresponds to the largest forcing frequency in the present work results are presented in fig 3 for the global flow coefficients c l r m s c l p r m s c d 0 and c d p 0 here c l r m s is the root mean square r m s value of the total lift coefficient c l p r m s the r m s of the pressure lift coefficient c d 0 the mean coefficient of the total drag and c d p 0 the mean coefficient of the pressure drag to avoid confusion with results of the fluctuation field presented in the following section the superscript 0 is hereafter used to indicate that the quantity is related to the mean flow field for all quantities measured the variation between the values at p 6 to p 7 is less than 1 considering both the convergence and the computational costs p 6 was adopted 3 3 2 flow past a fixed cylinder in order to validate the numerical code flow past a fixed cylinder which serves as the baseline case for analyzing the rotary oscillation of cylinders was first computed at a lower reynolds number of 150 the numerical validations mainly focused on hydrodynamic coefficients c l 0 r m s c d 0 0 and the strouhal number s t 0 in table 1 the results of our simulations are tabulated and compared with those of previous studies williamson 1989 baranyi and lewis 2006 lu et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 it is evident from these comparisons that our computed results are in fair agreement with the available reference data 3 3 3 flow past a rotary oscillating cylinder we further demonstrated the accuracy of our numerical code by applying it to simulate flow past a rotary oscillating cylinder the variation of the normalized mean drag coefficient c d 0 c d 0 0 with the forcing frequency for a velocity amplitude of a 2 is shown in fig 4 together with numerical results from ganta et al 2019 and bhumkar and sengupta 2009 and experimental data from thiria et al 2006 here c d 0 0 is the mean drag coefficient for the fixed cylinder as already mentioned in section 3 3 2 as seen in fig 4 the results of current simulation match well with previous literatures for f r above 1 especially well with that of ganta et al 2019 for lower f r all three numerical results seem to deviate somewhat from the experimental values but are within the probable experimental error indicated by vertical bars the overall consistency of our simulations with their results however does suggest that the present numerical methodology provides reliable results for the dynamics of the flow under investigation apart from the quantitative match of normalized mean drag coefficient we also qualitatively compared the wake topologies for the same forcing parameters with the computational results from protas and wesfreid 2002 these are shown in fig 5 the compared results are in perfect agreement in terms of the size and shape of the vortical structures a slight difference is noted though for the case of f r 2 fig 5 c the obtained wake is more stable and the onset of the secondary shedding is postponed further downstream this location is out of the field of view in comparison with that of protas and wesfreid 2002 this discrepancy is most likely due to the fact that the higher accuracy of the spectral element method leads to less numerical noise to trigger the convective instability 4 results and discussions for bluff body wakes it is well known that the major contribution to drag comes from pressure protas and wesfreid 2002 henderson 1995 bergmann et al 2006 at r e 200 we observed that pressure drag makes up at least 81 of the total drag approaching approximately 90 at higher forcing frequencies which will be shown fig 6 thus targeting the investigation of the drag it is rational to ignore the contribution from viscous shear stress and below we focus our analysis on the pressure effect 4 1 measurement of mean flow quantities the pressure drag coefficient c d p is the force due to pressure p non dimensionalized by the stagnation pressure and projected area 11 c d p p n x d s 1 2 ρ u 2 d here n x is the streamwise component of surface normal unit vector and d s is a differential element along the cylinder circumference the time averaged values of pressure drag coefficient c d p 0 are plotted as a function of f r in fig 6 together with its percentage contribution to the total drag coefficient as mentioned before the superscript 0 denotes the quantity that is related to the mean flow field at low values of f r the pressure drag is comparable to that observed for the unforced case f r 0 though it suffers a subtle reduction as f r increases there is a sharp rise in c d p 0 until its maximum value which corresponds to a forcing frequency close to unity f r 0 8 from this value the pressure drag sets to decrease and for relatively higher frequencies the cylinder is subject to drag reduction as f r increases further c d p 0 starts to increase again and tends to the value of the unforced case we note that the general shape of c d p 0 characterized by a sharp maximum and a wide minimum is qualitatively consistent with that found numerically by cheng et al 2001 and experimentally by tokumaru and dimotakis 1991 and thiria et al 2006 where the velocity amplitude a is fixed rather than the oscillation amplitude θ 0 as in the present study the highest drag reduction compared with the value of static cylinder is about 22 at f r 3 8 it is recalled that tokumaru and dimotakis 1991 acquired a much higher drag reduction of 80 at r e 15 000 also choi et al 2002 reported a reduction of drag by up to 60 at r e 1000 the effect of the forcing on the drag is therefore anticipated to be strongly reynolds number dependent even if the physical mechanisms are the same the time averaged pressure coefficient c p 0 on the surface of the cylinder is quantified in fig 7 for several selected cases these cases are considered as examples covering the typical behavior of the pressure drag over the entire frequency range as expected the distribution of pressure coefficient at f r 0 2 remains much closer to that identified in the non rotating case f r 0 with high c p 0 in the front stagnation point and low c p 0 in top and bottom of the cylinder however such an overlap is only confined to the windward side of the cylinder at f r 0 8 the pressure on the rear surface drops dramatically and the location of maximum suction switches from the shoulder to the base of the cylinder which results in a much higher pressure drag as can be seen in fig 6 for the case of f r 3 8 it is seen that windward regions of positive pressure are no longer present while c p 0 remains negative on the entire surface of the cylinder this attributes to the relatively significant reduction in drag further increase in f r leads to an overall downward shift of the c p 0 curve shown in fig 8 is the distribution of time averaged vorticity ω 0 on the cylinder surface the vorticity is defined as ω v x u y compared to f r 0 the maximum value of the mean vorticity both positive and negative monotonically decreases with the increasing of f r however the location of the peak value for all forcing frequencies is roughly the same it also shows that the vorticity on the rear of the cylinder remains approximately constant and lies close to zero except in the case of f r 0 8 where an amount of vorticity survives from the averaging process this is presumably responsible for the sudden drop of c p 0 on the rear surface for f r 0 8 see fig 7 since it is known that changes in the distribution of the pressure are intrinsically related to changes in vortex dynamics at the vicinity of cylinder additional insight into the effect of the forcing on the flow can be gained from mean streamwise velocity along the wake centerline which are shown in fig 9 it is seen that there is a mean recirculation zone featured by negative u 0 at the immediately downstream of the non rotating cylinder whereas for f r 0 8 this reverse flow zone is postponed further downstream while with a fast rate of velocity recovery in the very near wake surprisingly no negative velocity is observed along the wake centerline at f r 3 8 indicating the disappearance of the recirculation zone for the optimal drag reduction case which for simplicity will be named odr fig 9 also reveals that the imposed forcing leads to a larger velocity recovery in the far wake than the unforced case the forced wake is in fact profoundly affected in terms of both its average topology and its dynamics before investigating the latter it is interesting to see the recursive movement of the flow induced by this control for this purpose we resort to multi dimensional scaling mds mardia et al 1979 a means of visualizing high dimensional data in a low dimensional target space to begin with one needs to construct a distance matrix d able to quantify the relative difference between the instantaneous flow fields defined as 12 d i j u x t i u x t j where u x t i and u x t j are two instants of streamwise velocity field and is the discrete 2 norm the object of mds is to find a centered representation of points γ 1 γ 2 γ n r 2 so that their pairwise distances are optimally close to the original distances in d i e γ i γ j d i j figs 10 a and 11 a show a proximity map of all sampled snapshots n 800 in a two dimensional plane γ 1 γ 2 respectively for the unforced case and odr case each dot represents a snapshot and the scatterplot is colored by the corresponding pressure drag c d p and lift c l p coefficients respectively from left to right these plots manifest the relative distance between each snapshot and also reflect how much the flow evolves from snapshot to snapshot a k means clustering algorithm macqueen et al 1967 lloyd 1982 is further employed to partition the proximity map into 4 clusters as shown in the right most scatterplot of figs 10 a and 11 a an average of the snapshots falling into each of the four clusters is then visualized in figs 10 b and 11 b such visualization was previously used in the studies of flow control duriez et al 2017 wu et al 2018 minelli et al 2020 and bluff body wake flows kaiser et al 2014 due to the cyclic nature of this periodic flow the dots of unforced cases precisely reside on a circle fig 10 a a more random distribution is expected when the flow is in the turbulent regime minelli et al 2020 the scatterplot of odr also shows a circular pattern but with a larger radius fig 11 a highlighting the increased dissimilarity between the snapshots induced by the forcing in the unforced case the clusters can almost distinguish low and high drag states of the wake while it is not the case for odr where each cluster is a mixture of both states by looking at the wakes of the unforced case fig 10 b we note that clusters 1 and 3 associated with low drag states are characterized by a more elongated wake core by contrast a more compact and shorter wake core of clusters 2 and 4 is associated to high drag states all clusters of odr however display a similar wake pattern fig 11 b which is absent for the motion in the y direction comparing figs 10 b and 11 b one can also notice that the forcing dramatically modifies the reverse flow region delimited by dashed lines not only its shape but also perhaps more importantly its position as can be seen two rotation induced crescent shaped regions go tightly around the cylinder leaving almost the entire wake with positive streamwise velocity this is also corroborated previously by fig 9 4 2 pod of the fluctuating components of pressure field we perform pod analysis for all the forcing ratios to scrutinize the modification of coherent structures a total of n 800 snapshots of fluctuating pressure field with a temporal spacing of 0 2 time units are processed using the algorithm described in section 3 2 this sampling frequency satisfies the nyquist criterion even at the largest f r a convergence test for pod modes has also been conducted by varying the number of snapshots involved in the analysis the results indicate that the accuracy of the pod based on 800 snapshots is satisfactory for the present analysis fig 12 displays the normalized eigenspectrum modal energy content along with its cumulative distribution from six representative cases for f r lower than unity e g figs 12 a and 12 b the energy of the mode 1 far outstrips that of the subsequent modes while the energy levels are much closer to each other for first several modes when f r is higher than unity e g figs 12 d 12 f the cumulative energy distributions at f r 0 4 and 0 8 show that more than 10 modes must be retained to attain 95 of the total energy in contrast for higher values of f r the increase in cumulative energy is steeper at the initial stage and only first 5 modes already guarantee the same amount of energy these trends are a clear indication that higher forcing frequency brings in coherence in the dominant flow structures it is interesting to note that the pairing process of two consecutive modes is prominent for the resonant forcing fig 12 c that is the eigenvalues of the modes occur in pairs of comparable magnitude each pair of eigenfunctions bears many similarities to each other and describes two phases of the convective motion this is the case of the first 10 pod modes which are characterized by almost equal energy content spatial structure and spectral content of temporal coefficient in pairs the only stark difference is a temporal shift of their related coefficients as shown for example in the case of c 9 and c 10 in fig 13 a and by the phase portrait in fig 13 b the circular distribution of c 9 c 10 is actually ascribed to two periodic and sinusoidal oscillations that are governed by an equal frequency but with a phase shift of 90 this is also reflected in the patterns of the eigenmode pair in fig 14 which appear virtually as phase shifted versions of each other and displace about a quarter of characteristic wavelength in the streamwise direction the characteristic wavelength here refers to the peak to peak distance between two same signed coherent structures observed in the spatial eigenmodes however when such a pairing behavior between two modes is indistinguishable the related temporal coefficients exhibit not only a time shift but also some variation as shown for example in fig 15 a major objective of the present study is to explore the contribution of different pod modes to the pressure drag to this end further efforts are desired to be made to decompose the total pressure drag into individual components corresponding to each mode following the ideas developed by miyanawala and jaiman 2019 we start by an integration of eq 9 which depicts the approximate flow as a superposition of the mean flow field and r significant modes over the circumference of the cylinder for pressure field that is 13 p x t n x d s p x n x d s j 1 r c j t ϕ j x n x d s or further we can write in a concise form 14 f d p t f d p 0 j 1 r c j t f d p j where f d p 0 and f d p j are drag forces respectively due to the mean pressure field the zeroth mode and the j th mode therefore the total pressure drag f d p exerted on the cylinder can be decomposed into a time independent contribution from the zeroth mode i e the mean pressure field and a direct contribution from each pod mode this is a novel force decomposition which differs from the conventional force decomposition based on the added mass and the viscous force contributions miyanawala and jaiman 2019 note that such decomposition can also be applied to pressure lift force f l p by means of projecting the integrated force onto the y axis miyanawala and jaiman 2019 have determined a time dependent coefficient given by f d p t f d p 0 f d p j r for each modal drag f d p j it is absolutely correct in the mathematical sense but the important dynamical information inherent in the mode is stripped away in this expression since spectral content of each coefficient is identical and wholly stems from that of f d p t however in eq 14 we show that the temporal characteristic of f d p j is intrinsically controlled by pod coefficient c j t normalizing all the forces in eq 14 by 1 2 ρ u 2 d gives the force coefficients 15 c d p t c d p 0 j 1 r c d p j t where c d p 0 is the time independent pressure drag coefficient due to the mean field as already discussed in section 4 1 while c d p j is the time dependent pressure drag coefficient due to the j th mode fig 16 quantifies the time invariant contributions f d p j from first several modes to the drag force for an illustrative example of f r 0 in order to facilitate a better interpretation of modal characteristics the results for the lift force f l p j are also plotted herein clearly modes 1 2 5 and 6 contribute solely to the lift force whereas modes 3 4 7 and 8 are seen to exclusively contribute to the drag force it is therefore natural to generally categorize the modes into two classes lift modes and drag modes according to whether the mode is dedicated to the lift or the drag force the lift modes modes 1 2 5 and 6 are found to be antisymmetric with respect to the wake centerline as shown in fig 17 the antisymmetric distributions of lift modes in p can be ascribed to essentially antisymmetric nature of kármán vortex shedding yet the drag modes modes 3 4 7 and 8 appear to be symmetric about the wake centerline these observations have also been made in miyanawala and jaiman 2019 in the analysis of vortex induced vibration of a cylinder the distinction between two classes of modes is further captured by the power spectra of the corresponding pod coefficients c j t in fig 18 each spectrum is normalized by the magnitude of the largest peak the coefficients of the first lift mode pair are dominated by a single frequency equal to the natural shedding frequency f 0 while for the first drag mode pair the dominant peak shifts to a frequency of 2 f 0 i e twice the natural shedding frequency interestingly f 0 and 2 f 0 are known to respectively coincide with the frequencies of lift and drag time histories in fact an overall inspection of pod coefficients reveals that the lift modes only peak at odd harmonics of the vortex shedding frequency e g modes 5 and 6 in fig 18 whereas the drag modes only peak at even harmonics e g modes 7 and 8 in fig 18 the distinctive features of lift mode account for the negligible contribution to the drag force and vice versa for the drag mode see fig 16 we shall emphasize here that the basic features of the mode as described above are found to be are very robust over the range of f r studied f r 0 5 and the concept of lift and drag modes can also be applied for the conditions of f r 0 we now turn to an examination of relative contributions from different modes to the fluctuating drag force when the cylinder undergoes rotary oscillations fig 19 shows the r m s value of the pressure drag coefficient fluctuation c d p j as a function of the mode number for the same cases as those selected in fig 12 the observations reported in the following can be generalized to the entire f r range for most cases the fluctuation of pressure drag coefficient is seen to principally result from a single mode or from a mode pair due to the effect of mode pairing at f r 1 the contributions from the rest of the modes are considerably smaller the mode number at which the largest r m s value has been attained is not fixed but found to slightly vary with f r however a special case f r 0 4 exhibits some differences as the modes present comparable r m s values indicating a relatively dispersed distribution of the fluctuating force among them in this circumstance some of the higher modes which are inconsequential from the perspective of energy content might be crucial for accurately describing the temporal evolution of the drag force fig 20 plots the power spectra of pod coefficients c j t for the modes indicated by blue circles in fig 19 for higher values of f r due to the substantial impact of the forcing on the flow the mode contains only a single frequency content while for the low forcing frequency of f r 0 4 the synchronization regime has not been established in the near wake resulting in mode that contains several frequencies this leads to an elimination of the frequency limit between the lift and drag modes such prominent distinction persists for the first several modes and serves as a possible interpretation of the distinct distribution observed for f r 0 4 in fig 19 in general for a mode it belongs to either the drag mode or the lift mode thus given the tremendous contribution to the drag these modes except for f r 0 4 are the typical drag modes moreover as discussed before the drag mode is characterized by two basic features one is the symmetric distribution with respect to the wake centerline and the other one is the power spectra of the corresponding pod coefficient only peaking at even harmonics of the fundamental frequency this explains why the dominant peak always emerges at twice the forcing frequency i e 2 f r it should also be noted that a secondary peak corresponding to the forcing frequency marked by an arrow is present in the spectrum of f r 3 8 the involvement of this lift type frequency breaks the symmetry of the drag mode pattern and a subtle asymmetry appears which explains why the r m s value of the dominant drag mode acquires a local minima at f r 3 8 see fig 19 4 3 relationship between the wake and pod modes careful inspection of the cylinder wakes manifests that for f r above 1 the forced wake presents the universal characteristics as displayed in fig 21 that is two layers of small scale vortices also termed as flapping vortices thiria et al 2006 are shed at the forcing frequency in the near wake which advect downstream and merge from each layer to give a secondary vortex shedding in the far wake such wake somewhat resembles the wake of flow past a stationary elliptical cylinder thompson et al 2014 the secondary far wake shedding forms a vortex street similar to that behind a stationary cylinder but the dominant frequency of it is observed to be lower than the strouhal frequency kumar et al 2013 noted that this shedding frequency can be as low as 50 of the strouhal frequency for some cases at a lower reynolds number of 185 nevertheless details of the wake morphology are sensitive to f r for instance as f r increases the two layered wake is narrower and its downstream extent or the lock in length diminishes also as f r increases the size of the near wake vortices becomes progressively smaller the key features of the forced wake qualitatively described above are highly correlated to the spatial characteristics of the corresponding pod modes without loss of generality we take the f r 2 4 case as an example and illustrate it in fig 22 two parallel trains of successive counter rotating vortices behind the cylinder are visible for modes 1 and 2 figs 22 a and 22 b they experience a quick decay in the intensity as advected along the streamwise direction making their appearance confined within a region of approximately x 10 d this is also the area where the small scale flapping vortices are well developed see fig 21 b in addition the power spectra of c 1 and c 2 exhibit a sharp peak at the forcing frequency therefore modes 1 and 2 faithfully identify the evolution of the coherent structures in the near wake and are associated with the dynamics of the flapping vortices modes 3 and 4 not shown for the sake of conciseness characterized by half the spatial wavelength of mode 1 are higher harmonics of the first mode pair the dynamical features of the secondary vortex shedding are described by modes 5 and 6 figs 22 c and 22 d with large scale modal structures only residing in the far wake and a dominant frequency close to the strouhal frequency it is worth noting that modes 5 and 6 display an arrowhead like mode pattern which persists almost all the way to the end of the domain this arrowhead configuration was previously observed by bhumkar and sengupta 2009 in their optimal and suboptimal drag reduction cases but was not identified in the case with the maximum drag amplification they thus treated it as a paradigm of mode achieving significant drag reduction at lower reynolds numbers however no further attempt was made to check other cases while our thorough inspection confirms that not only the drag reduction situations but also the drag amplification situations can hold such type of the mode indeed it has been observed for f r above 1 i e in a range of forcing frequencies where the above mentioned universal wake develops we believe that the arrowhead like mode does exist as long as the wake undergoes a transition from the near wake two layer shedding pattern to the far wake kármán like shedding pattern further evidence that it is truly distilling structures from the seemingly random flow is provided by the pod reconstruction in fig 23 the top image shows a snapshot of the original vorticity field which is reproduced from fig 21 b below this fig 23 b shows the pod reconstruction just using the first four pod modes i e the near wake modes and their first harmonics and adding the result to the mean field as expected the reconstruction upon these modes restores the actual vorticity field in the near wake the two layers of flapping vortices are fully recovered while leaving an almost stationary wake profile far downstream the next image fig 23 c shows a reconstruction using the modes corresponding to the arrowhead like modes modes 5 and 6 and their first harmonics modes 9 and 10 together with the mean field this reconstructs the large scale secondary vortex street in the far wake it is seen that the main flow features are already captured with these modes despite that there are also some apparent variations in the details of morphology since only a small fraction of the energy of the flow is contained at present the inclusion of three additional harmonics improves the fidelity substantially especially near the onset of the secondary vortex shedding fig 23 d 5 conclusions results have been presented from two dimensional direct numerical simulations and proper orthogonal decomposition pod of flow past a cylinder in rotary oscillations at r e 200 and a fixed oscillation amplitude of θ 0 π a series of calculations were carried out by varying the oscillation frequency ratios in the range of 0 f r 5 to systematically investigate the dynamic response of the flow the principal findings of this work can be summarized as follows the global drag is found to vary strongly with f r as it goes from a drag amplification situation at lower f r to a drag reduction situation at higher f r the maximum drag reduction of about 22 is obtained at f r 3 8 compared with the static cylinder the variation of the drag can be attributed to the changes in the distribution of mean pressure on the cylinder surface and more essentially to the changes in vorticity dynamics in the very near wake pod of the fluctuating pressure field is performed for all of the cases to educe the dominant structures in the flow a pronounced behavior of mode pairing is noted for the resonant case where the modes are characterized by almost equal energy content spatial structure and spectral content of temporal coefficient in pairs furthermore we revisit and reformulate a novel force decomposition procedure based on the contributions from different pod modes which is first proposed by miyanawala and jaiman 2019 our derivations show that the temporal characteristic of the modal drag is intrinsically governed by the corresponding pod coefficient this enables one to evaluate the time dependent modal contribution to the fluctuating pressure drag by employing this decomposition we are able to generally categorize the modes into two classes namely the lift modes and the drag modes the lift modes with odd harmonic frequencies solely contribute to the lift force while the drag modes with even harmonic frequencies solely contribute to the drag force the distinction between two classes of modes is also reflected in their spatial distributions the lift modes are antisymmetric with respect to the wake centerline the drag modes are however symmetric about the wake centerline examination of the time dependent modal contribution reveals that in the cases of higher f r the fluctuation of pressure drag mainly results from a single mode or from a mode pair while with considerably smaller contributions from the remaining modes on the contrary in the cases of lower f r the contributions are more comparable among the modes this is possibly caused by the desynchronization between the vortex shedding frequency and the forcing frequency in the near wake in addition we note that the emergence of the lift type frequency in a drag mode can break its symmetry distribution and can to some degree suppress its drag fluctuation finally we also apply pod to the computed vorticity field whereby the spatially localized wake components characterized by the two layers of small scale vortices in the near wake and the large scale kármán like vortices in the far wake are faithfully correlated with the corresponding dominant modes such correlation is further evidenced by the pod reconstruction using just the dominant modes and their harmonics it is also found that to reconstruct the near wake accurately a few modes are sufficient while to ensure an accurate approximation of the far wake more modes must be retained credit

21332,two dimensional high order spectral hp computations are carried out for a cylinder undergoing a sinusoidal rotary oscillation about its own axis results are examined for r e 200 and a fixed oscillation amplitude of θ 0 π the study concentrates on a domain of forcing frequencies ranging from 0 to 5 f 0 with f 0 being the natural shedding frequency of the fixed cylinder the drag of the cylinder is measured to reduce by up to 22 at the optimal frequency this drag reduction is expected to result from the appearance of negative pressure in the windward regions of cylinder surface proper orthogonal decomposition pod is then utilized to extract the energetic modes that govern the dynamics of the flow a novel force decomposition technique proposed by miyanawala and jaiman 2019 is reformulated to allow quantification of the time dependent contribution from each mode to the pressure drag such contribution is found to be affected in a manner by the forcing frequency pod is further used to characterize the spatially evolving nature of the forced wake as it undergoes a transition from the near wake two layer shedding pattern to the far wake kármán like shedding pattern it is also found that a few modes suffice to reconstruct the near wake accurately while more modes must be retained to ensure an accurate approximation of the far wake keywords wake dynamics sinusoidal rotary oscillation low reynolds number spectral hp element method 1 introduction flow past bluff bodies subjected to periodic forced motions has been a focus of plentiful investigations in fluid mechanics interest in this class of flows arises not only from the view of understanding underlying diverse flow phenomena but also from its practical significance in predicting vortex induced vibrations and in flow control the external periodic forcing to a bluff body such as a circular cylinder can be realized by several means e g by oscillating cylinder in line with the free stream leontini et al 2011 2013 tang et al 2017 kim and choi 2019 or transverse bishop and hassan 1964 williamson and roshko 1988 blackburn and henderson 1999 carberry et al 2001 leontini et al 2006 kim et al 2014 kumar et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 or a combination thereof jeon and gharib 2001 due to the interaction of velocity fields induced by self excited wake instability and by the externally imposed forcing hydrodynamic forces and wake geometry depend strongly on the forcing parameters this becomes especially prominent for a cylinder when the forcing frequency varies in the vicinity of its natural shedding frequency studies into flow over a cylinder executing rotary oscillations have not been as widely conducted as rectilinear oscillations one of the earliest experiments was carried out by taneda 1978 over the reynolds number range of 30 330 the reynolds number here is defined as r e u d ν where u is the uniform incident velocity d the cylinder diameter and ν the kinematic viscosity he observed that the dead water region as well as vortex shedding process behind a cylinder can be eliminated for sufficiently large forcing frequencies taneda s 1978 results did suggest the potential for effective flow control by utilizing rotary oscillation of cylinders this was subsequently examined by tokumaru and dimotakis 1991 at a moderate reynolds number of 15000 they found such a control mechanism can achieve a significant drag reduction 80 for optimal forcing parameters also four distinct vortex wake modes were identified according to different regimes of vortex shedding and the length of the synchronization region shiels and leonard 2001 via two dimensional numerical simulations over a wide range of reynolds numbers from 150 to 15000 confirmed the tokumaru and dimotakis s 1991 observation of remarkable decrease in drag at higher reynolds numbers but it was found the forcing is ineffective for drag reduction at lower reynolds numbers a similar finding was made by choi et al 2002 who simulated two dimensional flow past a sinusoidally rotating cylinder at r e 1000 and 100 and showed that the amount of mean drag reduction drops from 60 to 12 these results expressly indicate that the efficacy of this control is reynolds number dependent thiria et al 2006 for the first time performed direct experimental drag measurements for a rotationally oscillating cylinder at a lower reynolds number of 150 the global variation of drag coefficient with the forcing frequency exhibits a sharp maximum and a wide minimum the locations of which are generally subject to the velocity amplitude the ratio of peak cylinder surface velocity to free stream velocity on the basis of impulse formula saffman 1992 the drag coefficient was further associated with the wake pattern which shows a high degree of consistency of significant interest is the exploration of the underlying physical mechanisms responsible for drag reduction for cases with appropriate rotational oscillations shiels and leonard 2001 noticed a bursting event in the boundary layer which leads to the formation of a multipole vorticity structure the interaction of these vortex multipoles results in a time averaged delay in separation and thus leads to drag reduction protas and wesfreid 2002 in their numerical study at r e 150 intrinsically related the modification of drag to the mean flow correction through the action of the divergence of the reynolds stress tensor of the forced flow detailed scrutiny revealed that the mean drag reduction occurs when the control drives the mean flow towards the unstable symmetric state the basic flow i e when the drag of the mean flow correction is driven to close to zero with the aid of energy based receptivity analysis sengupta et al 2003 bhumkar and sengupta 2009 have shown that triplets of disturbance energy sinks and a source exist in the wake of a harmonically rotating cylinder compared to lower reynolds numbers such structures are much smaller in size and less coherent at higher reynolds numbers but are prone to a better performance on drag reduction wake structures behind a rotary oscillating cylinder display complicated spatio temporal evolutions and diverse set of vortex shedding modes can be identified with the variation of the forcing parameters mittal et al 2017 gao et al 2018 a candidate for the analysis of this type of flow is the proper orthogonal decomposition pod since its introduction to fluid dynamics by lumley 1967 1970 and sirovich 1987 pod also known by many different names in different disciplines e g principal component analysis empirical component analysis karhunen loève decomposition has been a well developed method for identifying the organized structures from the flow data the pod technique determines a subspace that optimally represents a given dataset in a least squares sense this involves decomposing a set of physical field data either numerical or experimental into a minimal number of spatially orthogonal modes based on the energy ranking with only a finite series of the most energetic modes a low dimensional description of the system s dynamics can be readily realized a great many applications of pod to unveil the large scale structures in the wake are primarily focused on flow past stationary bodies muld et al 2012 deri et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 or on freely vibrating bodies huera huarte and vernet 2010 cagney and balabani 2013 riches et al 2018 miyanawala and jaiman 2019 however to the authors knowledge except the work of bergmann et al 2005 bergmann and cordier 2006 very few literatures have applied it to forced oscillation problems whether to rectilinear or rotary oscillations the initial motivation for the current study was to present a pod analysis of the wake behind a cylinder in rotary oscillating motion in particular we wish to quantify the contribution from each pod mode to the drag force and characterize how this contribution varies as a function of the frequency ratio the outline of this paper is as follows the problem definition and the non dimensional parameters are introduced in section 2 in section 3 we provide details of the numerical methods used in the dns and pod and discuss various computational details as well as the convergence tests and validations the main results are presented and analyzed in section 4 first the effects of varying frequency ratio on mean flow quantities are explored section 4 1 subsequently a pod analysis in terms of the fluctuating pressure field is provided section 4 2 then the spatially evolving character of the wake is studied and the associated pod modes are described section 4 3 finally section 5 summarizes the main findings of this paper 2 problem definition we are interested in a two dimensional circular cylinder immersed in a free stream undergoing a sinusoidal rotary oscillation about its axis in the form of 1 θ θ 0 sin 2 π f f t where θ is the angular position of the cylinder θ 0 is the oscillation amplitude and f f is the forcing frequency a schematic diagram of the problem under consideration is shown in fig 1 the velocity amplitude a adopted by the majority of studies can be related to the oscillation amplitude used in the present work by the following transformation 2 a π f f θ 0 d u our primary characterization of results is made for a single oscillation amplitude θ 0 π at a fixed reynolds number of r e 200 and with a wide range of frequency ratios f r f f f 0 ranging from 0 to 5 in steps of 0 2 we define f 0 as the natural shedding frequency of the fixed cylinder and the frequencies in this paper are all normalized by f 0 a word of explanation is needed regarding the applicability of two dimensional results for the current configuration although flow past a fixed cylinder at r e 200 is at the onset of three dimensionality the rotary oscillation of the cylinder is expected to impose strong two dimensionality on the wake this issue has been studied by poncet 2002 who showed that even at higher reynolds number of 500 forcing the cylinder with high enough amplitude θ 0 π 2 can suppress the mode b instability and make the flow nominally two dimensional furthermore sengupta and patidar 2018 found that for flow behind a sinusoidally rotating cylinder the reynolds number for the onset of three dimensional instabilities is far higher than its fixed cylinder counterpart therefore it can be concluded from these studies that the flow considered in the present study is safely within the two dimensional regime 3 numerical methodology 3 1 direct numerical simulation dns we consider a two dimensional incompressible viscous flow which is governed by the navier stokes equations the non dimensional form of the equations can be written as 3 u t u u p 1 r e 2 u 4 u 0 here u u v is the velocity vector field p the static pressure and r e the reynolds number the pressure is assumed to be scaled by the constant fluid density ρ the spatial discretization of these equations was achieved using highly accurate spectral h p element method karniadakis and sherwin 2013 which combines the geometric flexibility of classical linear finite element methods with the attractive convergence properties of spectral methods spectral h p element method allows the solution to be refined either by increasing the number of elements h refinement or the order of the polynomial expansions p in each element p refinement the equations were then solved through second order time integration using a stiffly stable splitting scheme karniadakis et al 1991 guermond and shen 2003 a spectral h p element navier stokes solver encapsulated within nektar cantwell et al 2015 xu et al 2018 moxey et al 2019 was employed to perform all numerical simulations below the spatial discretization in the x y plane was comprised of a mesh with 2983 spectral elements shown in fig 2 with both the solution and the geometry represented by sixth order modified lagrange polynomials inside each element this mesh extended 50 d downstream and 30 d upstream above and below the cylinder which means the blockage is restricted to 1 67 free stream dirichlet boundary conditions u u 0 were set at the inlet and the lateral boundaries and a no slip condition set on the cylinder surface at the downstream or outflow boundary the zero normal gradient condition u n 0 where n is the normal unit vector was imposed for the pressure except for the outflow with a fixed value of p 0 a high order neumann condition was used at all boundaries karniadakis et al 1991 depending on the forcing frequency a non dimensional time step varying from 5 1 0 4 to 1 1 0 3 was used and the integration in time was second order accurate for each forcing frequency the simulations were performed for some time after transients have died out and the saturated state has been reached so that converged statistics can be obtained 3 2 proper orthogonal decomposition the present study incorporates the pod algorithm to describe the spatio temporal variations of wake characteristics behind a rotationally oscillating cylinder for handling numerical data where the product of numbers of grid points along the coordinate directions n x n y is generally larger than the number of data snapshots n the so called s n a p s h o t p o d by sirovich 1987 is most appropriate and efficient for the sake of completeness the basic algorithm to extract proper orthogonal modes is briefly recapitulated as follows here each instantaneous flow field i e the snapshot is expressed as a column vector

convergence test was conducted for the macro element mesh by varying the order of the polynomial expansion p within each element simulations were performed for a rotationally oscillating cylinder at r e 200 with θ 0 π and f r 5 this case corresponds to the largest forcing frequency in the present work results are presented in fig 3 for the global flow coefficients c l r m s c l p r m s c d 0 and c d p 0 here c l r m s is the root mean square r m s value of the total lift coefficient c l p r m s the r m s of the pressure lift coefficient c d 0 the mean coefficient of the total drag and c d p 0 the mean coefficient of the pressure drag to avoid confusion with results of the fluctuation field presented in the following section the superscript 0 is hereafter used to indicate that the quantity is related to the mean flow field for all quantities measured the variation between the values at p 6 to p 7 is less than 1 considering both the convergence and the computational costs p 6 was adopted 3 3 2 flow past a fixed cylinder in order to validate the numerical code flow past a fixed cylinder which serves as the baseline case for analyzing the rotary oscillation of cylinders was first computed at a lower reynolds number of 150 the numerical validations mainly focused on hydrodynamic coefficients c l 0 r m s c d 0 0 and the strouhal number s t 0 in table 1 the results of our simulations are tabulated and compared with those of previous studies williamson 1989 baranyi and lewis 2006 lu et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 it is evident from these comparisons that our computed results are in fair agreement with the available reference data 3 3 3 flow past a rotary oscillating cylinder we further demonstrated the accuracy of our numerical code by applying it to simulate flow past a rotary oscillating cylinder the variation of the normalized mean drag coefficient c d 0 c d 0 0 with the forcing frequency for a velocity amplitude of a 2 is shown in fig 4 together with numerical results from ganta et al 2019 and bhumkar and sengupta 2009 and experimental data from thiria et al 2006 here c d 0 0 is the mean drag coefficient for the fixed cylinder as already mentioned in section 3 3 2 as seen in fig 4 the results of current simulation match well with previous literatures for f r above 1 especially well with that of ganta et al 2019 for lower f r all three numerical results seem to deviate somewhat from the experimental values but are within the probable experimental error indicated by vertical bars the overall consistency of our simulations with their results however does suggest that the present numerical methodology provides reliable results for the dynamics of the flow under investigation apart from the quantitative match of normalized mean drag coefficient we also qualitatively compared the wake topologies for the same forcing parameters with the computational results from protas and wesfreid 2002 these are shown in fig 5 the compared results are in perfect agreement in terms of the size and shape of the vortical structures a slight difference is noted though for the case of f r 2 fig 5 c the obtained wake is more stable and the onset of the secondary shedding is postponed further downstream this location is out of the field of view in comparison with that of protas and wesfreid 2002 this discrepancy is most likely due to the fact that the higher accuracy of the spectral element method leads to less numerical noise to trigger the convective instability 4 results and discussions for bluff body wakes it is well known that the major contribution to drag comes from pressure protas and wesfreid 2002 henderson 1995 bergmann et al 2006 at r e 200 we observed that pressure drag makes up at least 81 of the total drag approaching approximately 90 at higher forcing frequencies which will be shown fig 6 thus targeting the investigation of the drag it is rational to ignore the contribution from viscous shear stress and below we focus our analysis on the pressure effect 4 1 measurement of mean flow quantities the pressure drag coefficient c d p is the force due to pressure p non dimensionalized by the stagnation pressure and projected area 11 c d p p n x d s 1 2 ρ u 2 d here n x is the streamwise component of surface normal unit vector and d s is a differential element along the cylinder circumference the time averaged values of pressure drag coefficient c d p 0 are plotted as a function of f r in fig 6 together with its percentage contribution to the total drag coefficient as mentioned before the superscript 0 denotes the quantity that is related to the mean flow field at low values of f r the pressure drag is comparable to that observed for the unforced case f r 0 though it suffers a subtle reduction as f r increases there is a sharp rise in c d p 0 until its maximum value which corresponds to a forcing frequency close to unity f r 0 8 from this value the pressure drag sets to decrease and for relatively higher frequencies the cylinder is subject to drag reduction as f r increases further c d p 0 starts to increase again and tends to the value of the unforced case we note that the general shape of c d p 0 characterized by a sharp maximum and a wide minimum is qualitatively consistent with that found numerically by cheng et al 2001 and experimentally by tokumaru and dimotakis 1991 and thiria et al 2006 where the velocity amplitude a is fixed rather than the oscillation amplitude θ 0 as in the present study the highest drag reduction compared with the value of static cylinder is about 22 at f r 3 8 it is recalled that tokumaru and dimotakis 1991 acquired a much higher drag reduction of 80 at r e 15 000 also choi et al 2002 reported a reduction of drag by up to 60 at r e 1000 the effect of the forcing on the drag is therefore anticipated to be strongly reynolds number dependent even if the physical mechanisms are the same the time averaged pressure coefficient c p 0 on the surface of the cylinder is quantified in fig 7 for several selected cases these cases are considered as examples covering the typical behavior of the pressure drag over the entire frequency range as expected the distribution of pressure coefficient at f r 0 2 remains much closer to that identified in the non rotating case f r 0 with high c p 0 in the front stagnation point and low c p 0 in top and bottom of the cylinder however such an overlap is only confined to the windward side of the cylinder at f r 0 8 the pressure on the rear surface drops dramatically and the location of maximum suction switches from the shoulder to the base of the cylinder which results in a much higher pressure drag as can be seen in fig 6 for the case of f r 3 8 it is seen that windward regions of positive pressure are no longer present while c p 0 remains negative on the entire surface of the cylinder this attributes to the relatively significant reduction in drag further increase in f r leads to an overall downward shift of the c p 0 curve shown in fig 8 is the distribution of time averaged vorticity ω 0 on the cylinder surface the vorticity is defined as ω v x u y compared to f r 0 the maximum value of the mean vorticity both positive and negative monotonically decreases with the increasing of f r however the location of the peak value for all forcing frequencies is roughly the same it also shows that the vorticity on the rear of the cylinder remains approximately constant and lies close to zero except in the case of f r 0 8 where an amount of vorticity survives from the averaging process this is presumably responsible for the sudden drop of c p 0 on the rear surface for f r 0 8 see fig 7 since it is known that changes in the distribution of the pressure are intrinsically related to changes in vortex dynamics at the vicinity of cylinder additional insight into the effect of the forcing on the flow can be gained from mean streamwise velocity along the wake centerline which are shown in fig 9 it is seen that there is a mean recirculation zone featured by negative u 0 at the immediately downstream of the non rotating cylinder whereas for f r 0 8 this reverse flow zone is postponed further downstream while with a fast rate of velocity recovery in the very near wake surprisingly no negative velocity is observed along the wake centerline at f r 3 8 indicating the disappearance of the recirculation zone for the optimal drag reduction case which for simplicity will be named odr fig 9 also reveals that the imposed forcing leads to a larger velocity recovery in the far wake than the unforced case the forced wake is in fact profoundly affected in terms of both its average topology and its dynamics before investigating the latter it is interesting to see the recursive movement of the flow induced by this control for this purpose we resort to multi dimensional scaling mds mardia et al 1979 a means of visualizing high dimensional data in a low dimensional target space to begin with one needs to construct a distance matrix d able to quantify the relative difference between the instantaneous flow fields defined as 12 d i j u x t i u x t j where u x t i and u x t j are two instants of streamwise velocity field and is the discrete 2 norm the object of mds is to find a centered representation of points γ 1 γ 2 γ n r 2 so that their pairwise distances are optimally close to the original distances in d i e γ i γ j d i j figs 10 a and 11 a show a proximity map of all sampled snapshots n 800 in a two dimensional plane γ 1 γ 2 respectively for the unforced case and odr case each dot represents a snapshot and the scatterplot is colored by the corresponding pressure drag c d p and lift c l p coefficients respectively from left to right these plots manifest the relative distance between each snapshot and also reflect how much the flow evolves from snapshot to snapshot a k means clustering algorithm macqueen et al 1967 lloyd 1982 is further employed to partition the proximity map into 4 clusters as shown in the right most scatterplot of figs 10 a and 11 a an average of the snapshots falling into each of the four clusters is then visualized in figs 10 b and 11 b such visualization was previously used in the studies of flow control duriez et al 2017 wu et al 2018 minelli et al 2020 and bluff body wake flows kaiser et al 2014 due to the cyclic nature of this periodic flow the dots of unforced cases precisely reside on a circle fig 10 a a more random distribution is expected when the flow is in the turbulent regime minelli et al 2020 the scatterplot of odr also shows a circular pattern but with a larger radius fig 11 a highlighting the increased dissimilarity between the snapshots induced by the forcing in the unforced case the clusters can almost distinguish low and high drag states of the wake while it is not the case for odr where each cluster is a mixture of both states by looking at the wakes of the unforced case fig 10 b we note that clusters 1 and 3 associated with low drag states are characterized by a more elongated wake core by contrast a more compact and shorter wake core of clusters 2 and 4 is associated to high drag states all clusters of odr however display a similar wake pattern fig 11 b which is absent for the motion in the y direction comparing figs 10 b and 11 b one can also notice that the forcing dramatically modifies the reverse flow region delimited by dashed lines not only its shape but also perhaps more importantly its position as can be seen two rotation induced crescent shaped regions go tightly around the cylinder leaving almost the entire wake with positive streamwise velocity this is also corroborated previously by fig 9 4 2 pod of the fluctuating components of pressure field we perform pod analysis for all the forcing ratios to scrutinize the modification of coherent structures a total of n 800 snapshots of fluctuating pressure field with a temporal spacing of 0 2 time units are processed using the algorithm described in section 3 2 this sampling frequency satisfies the nyquist criterion even at the largest f r a convergence test for pod modes has also been conducted by varying the number of snapshots involved in the analysis the results indicate that the accuracy of the pod based on 800 snapshots is satisfactory for the present analysis fig 12 displays the normalized eigenspectrum modal energy content along with its cumulative distribution from six representative cases for f r lower than unity e g figs 12 a and 12 b the energy of the mode 1 far outstrips that of the subsequent modes while the energy levels are much closer to each other for first several modes when f r is higher than unity e g figs 12 d 12 f the cumulative energy distributions at f r 0 4 and 0 8 show that more than 10 modes must be retained to attain 95 of the total energy in contrast for higher values of f r the increase in cumulative energy is steeper at the initial stage and only first 5 modes already guarantee the same amount of energy these trends are a clear indication that higher forcing frequency brings in coherence in the dominant flow structures it is interesting to note that the pairing process of two consecutive modes is prominent for the resonant forcing fig 12 c that is the eigenvalues of the modes occur in pairs of comparable magnitude each pair of eigenfunctions bears many similarities to each other and describes two phases of the convective motion this is the case of the first 10 pod modes which are characterized by almost equal energy content spatial structure and spectral content of temporal coefficient in pairs the only stark difference is a temporal shift of their related coefficients as shown for example in the case of c 9 and c 10 in fig 13 a and by the phase portrait in fig 13 b the circular distribution of c 9 c 10 is actually ascribed to two periodic and sinusoidal oscillations that are governed by an equal frequency but with a phase shift of 90 this is also reflected in the patterns of the eigenmode pair in fig 14 which appear virtually as phase shifted versions of each other and displace about a quarter of characteristic wavelength in the streamwise direction the characteristic wavelength here refers to the peak to peak distance between two same signed coherent structures observed in the spatial eigenmodes however when such a pairing behavior between two modes is indistinguishable the related temporal coefficients exhibit not only a time shift but also some variation as shown for example in fig 15 a major objective of the present study is to explore the contribution of different pod modes to the pressure drag to this end further efforts are desired to be made to decompose the total pressure drag into individual components corresponding to each mode following the ideas developed by miyanawala and jaiman 2019 we start by an integration of eq 9 which depicts the approximate flow as a superposition of the mean flow field and r significant modes over the circumference of the cylinder for pressure field that is 13 p x t n x d s p x n x d s j 1 r c j t ϕ j x n x d s or further we can write in a concise form 14 f d p t f d p 0 j 1 r c j t f d p j where f d p 0 and f d p j are drag forces respectively due to the mean pressure field the zeroth mode and the j th mode therefore the total pressure drag f d p exerted on the cylinder can be decomposed into a time independent contribution from the zeroth mode i e the mean pressure field and a direct contribution from each pod mode this is a novel force decomposition which differs from the conventional force decomposition based on the added mass and the viscous force contributions miyanawala and jaiman 2019 note that such decomposition can also be applied to pressure lift force f l p by means of projecting the integrated force onto the y axis miyanawala and jaiman 2019 have determined a time dependent coefficient given by f d p t f d p 0 f d p j r for each modal drag f d p j it is absolutely correct in the mathematical sense but the important dynamical information inherent in the mode is stripped away in this expression since spectral content of each coefficient is identical and wholly stems from that of f d p t however in eq 14 we show that the temporal characteristic of f d p j is intrinsically controlled by pod coefficient c j t normalizing all the forces in eq 14 by 1 2 ρ u 2 d gives the force coefficients 15 c d p t c d p 0 j 1 r c d p j t where c d p 0 is the time independent pressure drag coefficient due to the mean field as already discussed in section 4 1 while c d p j is the time dependent pressure drag coefficient due to the j th mode fig 16 quantifies the time invariant contributions f d p j from first several modes to the drag force for an illustrative example of f r 0 in order to facilitate a better interpretation of modal characteristics the results for the lift force f l p j are also plotted herein clearly modes 1 2 5 and 6 contribute solely to the lift force whereas modes 3 4 7 and 8 are seen to exclusively contribute to the drag force it is therefore natural to generally categorize the modes into two classes lift modes and drag modes according to whether the mode is dedicated to the lift or the drag force the lift modes modes 1 2 5 and 6 are found to be antisymmetric with respect to the wake centerline as shown in fig 17 the antisymmetric distributions of lift modes in p can be ascribed to essentially antisymmetric nature of kármán vortex shedding yet the drag modes modes 3 4 7 and 8 appear to be symmetric about the wake centerline these observations have also been made in miyanawala and jaiman 2019 in the analysis of vortex induced vibration of a cylinder the distinction between two classes of modes is further captured by the power spectra of the corresponding pod coefficients c j t in fig 18 each spectrum is normalized by the magnitude of the largest peak the coefficients of the first lift mode pair are dominated by a single frequency equal to the natural shedding frequency f 0 while for the first drag mode pair the dominant peak shifts to a frequency of 2 f 0 i e twice the natural shedding frequency interestingly f 0 and 2 f 0 are known to respectively coincide with the frequencies of lift and drag time histories in fact an overall inspection of pod coefficients reveals that the lift modes only peak at odd harmonics of the vortex shedding frequency e g modes 5 and 6 in fig 18 whereas the drag modes only peak at even harmonics e g modes 7 and 8 in fig 18 the distinctive features of lift mode account for the negligible contribution to the drag force and vice versa for the drag mode see fig 16 we shall emphasize here that the basic features of the mode as described above are found to be are very robust over the range of f r studied f r 0 5 and the concept of lift and drag modes can also be applied for the conditions of f r 0 we now turn to an examination of relative contributions from different modes to the fluctuating drag force when the cylinder undergoes rotary oscillations fig 19 shows the r m s value of the pressure drag coefficient fluctuation c d p j as a function of the mode number for the same cases as those selected in fig 12 the observations reported in the following can be generalized to the entire f r range for most cases the fluctuation of pressure drag coefficient is seen to principally result from a single mode or from a mode pair due to the effect of mode pairing at f r 1 the contributions from the rest of the modes are considerably smaller the mode number at which the largest r m s value has been attained is not fixed but found to slightly vary with f r however a special case f r 0 4 exhibits some differences as the modes present comparable r m s values indicating a relatively dispersed distribution of the fluctuating force among them in this circumstance some of the higher modes which are inconsequential from the perspective of energy content might be crucial for accurately describing the temporal evolution of the drag force fig 20 plots the power spectra of pod coefficients c j t for the modes indicated by blue circles in fig 19 for higher values of f r due to the substantial impact of the forcing on the flow the mode contains only a single frequency content while for the low forcing frequency of f r 0 4 the synchronization regime has not been established in the near wake resulting in mode that contains several frequencies this leads to an elimination of the frequency limit between the lift and drag modes such prominent distinction persists for the first several modes and serves as a possible interpretation of the distinct distribution observed for f r 0 4 in fig 19 in general for a mode it belongs to either the drag mode or the lift mode thus given the tremendous contribution to the drag these modes except for f r 0 4 are the typical drag modes moreover as discussed before the drag mode is characterized by two basic features one is the symmetric distribution with respect to the wake centerline and the other one is the power spectra of the corresponding pod coefficient only peaking at even harmonics of the fundamental frequency this explains why the dominant peak always emerges at twice the forcing frequency i e 2 f r it should also be noted that a secondary peak corresponding to the forcing frequency marked by an arrow is present in the spectrum of f r 3 8 the involvement of this lift type frequency breaks the symmetry of the drag mode pattern and a subtle asymmetry appears which explains why the r m s value of the dominant drag mode acquires a local minima at f r 3 8 see fig 19 4 3 relationship between the wake and pod modes careful inspection of the cylinder wakes manifests that for f r above 1 the forced wake presents the universal characteristics as displayed in fig 21 that is two layers of small scale vortices also termed as flapping vortices thiria et al 2006 are shed at the forcing frequency in the near wake which advect downstream and merge from each layer to give a secondary vortex shedding in the far wake such wake somewhat resembles the wake of flow past a stationary elliptical cylinder thompson et al 2014 the secondary far wake shedding forms a vortex street similar to that behind a stationary cylinder but the dominant frequency of it is observed to be lower than the strouhal frequency kumar et al 2013 noted that this shedding frequency can be as low as 50 of the strouhal frequency for some cases at a lower reynolds number of 185 nevertheless details of the wake morphology are sensitive to f r for instance as f r increases the two layered wake is narrower and its downstream extent or the lock in length diminishes also as f r increases the size of the near wake vortices becomes progressively smaller the key features of the forced wake qualitatively described above are highly correlated to the spatial characteristics of the corresponding pod modes without loss of generality we take the f r 2 4 case as an example and illustrate it in fig 22 two parallel trains of successive counter rotating vortices behind the cylinder are visible for modes 1 and 2 figs 22 a and 22 b they experience a quick decay in the intensity as advected along the streamwise direction making their appearance confined within a region of approximately x 10 d this is also the area where the small scale flapping vortices are well developed see fig 21 b in addition the power spectra of c 1 and c 2 exhibit a sharp peak at the forcing frequency therefore modes 1 and 2 faithfully identify the evolution of the coherent structures in the near wake and are associated with the dynamics of the flapping vortices modes 3 and 4 not shown for the sake of conciseness characterized by half the spatial wavelength of mode 1 are higher harmonics of the first mode pair the dynamical features of the secondary vortex shedding are described by modes 5 and 6 figs 22 c and 22 d with large scale modal structures only residing in the far wake and a dominant frequency close to the strouhal frequency it is worth noting that modes 5 and 6 display an arrowhead like mode pattern which persists almost all the way to the end of the domain this arrowhead configuration was previously observed by bhumkar and sengupta 2009 in their optimal and suboptimal drag reduction cases but was not identified in the case with the maximum drag amplification they thus treated it as a paradigm of mode achieving significant drag reduction at lower reynolds numbers however no further attempt was made to check other cases while our thorough inspection confirms that not only the drag reduction situations but also the drag amplification situations can hold such type of the mode indeed it has been observed for f r above 1 i e in a range of forcing frequencies where the above mentioned universal wake develops we believe that the arrowhead like mode does exist as long as the wake undergoes a transition from the near wake two layer shedding pattern to the far wake kármán like shedding pattern further evidence that it is truly distilling structures from the seemingly random flow is provided by the pod reconstruction in fig 23 the top image shows a snapshot of the original vorticity field which is reproduced from fig 21 b below this fig 23 b shows the pod reconstruction just using the first four pod modes i e the near wake modes and their first harmonics and adding the result to the mean field as expected the reconstruction upon these modes restores the actual vorticity field in the near wake the two layers of flapping vortices are fully recovered while leaving an almost stationary wake profile far downstream the next image fig 23 c shows a reconstruction using the modes corresponding to the arrowhead like modes modes 5 and 6 and their first harmonics modes 9 and 10 together with the mean field this reconstructs the large scale secondary vortex street in the far wake it is seen that the main flow features are already captured with these modes despite that there are also some apparent variations in the details of morphology since only a small fraction of the energy of the flow is contained at present the inclusion of three additional harmonics improves the fidelity substantially especially near the onset of the secondary vortex shedding fig 23 d 5 conclusions results have been presented from two dimensional direct numerical simulations and proper orthogonal decomposition pod of flow past a cylinder in rotary oscillations at r e 200 and a fixed oscillation amplitude of θ 0 π a series of calculations were carried out by varying the oscillation frequency ratios in the range of 0 f r 5 to systematically investigate the dynamic response of the flow the principal findings of this work can be summarized as follows the global drag is found to vary strongly with f r as it goes from a drag amplification situation at lower f r to a drag reduction situation at higher f r the maximum drag reduction of about 22 is obtained at f r 3 8 compared with the static cylinder the variation of the drag can be attributed to the changes in the distribution of mean pressure on the cylinder surface and more essentially to the changes in vorticity dynamics in the very near wake pod of the fluctuating pressure field is performed for all of the cases to educe the dominant structures in the flow a pronounced behavior of mode pairing is noted for the resonant case where the modes are characterized by almost equal energy content spatial structure and spectral content of temporal coefficient in pairs furthermore we revisit and reformulate a novel force decomposition procedure based on the contributions from different pod modes which is first proposed by miyanawala and jaiman 2019 our derivations show that the temporal characteristic of the modal drag is intrinsically governed by the corresponding pod coefficient this enables one to evaluate the time dependent modal contribution to the fluctuating pressure drag by employing this decomposition we are able to generally categorize the modes into two classes namely the lift modes and the drag modes the lift modes with odd harmonic frequencies solely contribute to the lift force while the drag modes with even harmonic frequencies solely contribute to the drag force the distinction between two classes of modes is also reflected in their spatial distributions the lift modes are antisymmetric with respect to the wake centerline the drag modes are however symmetric about the wake centerline examination of the time dependent modal contribution reveals that in the cases of higher f r the fluctuation of pressure drag mainly results from a single mode or from a mode pair while with considerably smaller contributions from the remaining modes on the contrary in the cases of lower f r the contributions are more comparable among the modes this is possibly caused by the desynchronization between the vortex shedding frequency and the forcing frequency in the near wake in addition we note that the emergence of the lift type frequency in a drag mode can break its symmetry distribution and can to some degree suppress its drag fluctuation finally we also apply pod to the computed vorticity field whereby the spatially localized wake components characterized by the two layers of small scale vortices in the near wake and the large scale kármán like vortices in the far wake are faithfully correlated with the corresponding dominant modes such correlation is further evidenced by the pod reconstruction using just the dominant modes and their harmonics it is also found that to reconstruct the near wake accurately a few modes are sufficient while to ensure an accurate approximation of the far wake more modes must be retained credit

temporary variations of a sea state impose time dependent disturbing forces to a sea going vessel and consequently necessitate appropriate corrections to steer the vessel to a desired location while continuously monitoring external conditions with the advent of various branches of engineering customarily human piloting of a vessel has been advancing towards auto piloting likewise if a vessel is required to remain at a certain point the actions taken are considered as dynamic positioning both tasks of piloting and positioning fall into the realm of ship manoeuvring which in turn implies a set of time dependent differential equations with definite controllable terms representing steering forces and moments thus the entire problem may be viewed as composed of two main parts first solving the differential equations governing ship manoeuvring and second determining the appropriate commands to the control terms all these of course are performed in a coupled manner by taking into account responses of the vessel as feedback since the early 1960 s ship manoeuvring has been among intensely studies areas of naval architecture reasons for devoting such considerable efforts to the subject may be attributed to a variety of parameters involved in modelling the ship manoeuvring to begin with hydrodynamic behaviour of a ship in motion depends closely on her particular form and this dependency must be formulated for different motions determination of external forces due to waves and currents for a varying sea state poses another challenge moreover there are the wind forces acting on the superstructure it is therefore not surprising that an enormous literature has been accumulated in these and related subjects as presented in a relatively recent review in hirdaris et al 2014 increasing computational capabilities have led to more detailed investigations by numerical means a simulink based marine control system was described in detail by perez et al 2006 moreira fossen and soares moreira et al 2007 presented a path following control system for a surface vessel with particular reference to a possible future application to esso osaka tanker seo and kim 2011 simulated coupled ship manoeuvring and motions in presence of waves slow steaming performance of a ship in waves was considered in tezdoğan et al tezdogan et al 2015 with the aim of reducing operational costs in a study concerning ship optimization tahara et al 2006 manoeuvrability performance was included among multiple objectives of the optimization process kim et al 2017 investigated the added resistance of kvlcc2 ship in head seas for various speeds and wave conditions kurowski köckritz and korte kurowski et al 2013 presented a comprehensive manoeuvring planning system for marine vessels travel duration and fuel consumption were used to determine the optimum route of a vessel by fang and lin 2015 for efficiency and economy as early as 1977 källström et al 1977 suggested two adaptive autopilots simple and advanced to reduce the fuel consumption of tankers çimen and banks cimen and banks 2004 developed optimal tracking controllers for non linear systems and applied these on the esso oil tanker claiming better efficiency compared to manual open loop operation relatively recently bhattacharya et al 2011 proposed a fuzzy autopilot control for ship manoeuvring in the absence of external forces the present work introduces a simulink code for ship manoeuvring simulations with choices of the abkowitz and mmg models inclusion of two different methods a novelty of the present work makes the code a versatile tool that can be switched to either model depending on the available hydrodynamic characteristics of the ship in order to test the proper working of each model the benchmark tests are done by considering two vessels with parameters suitable for the abkowitz and mmg models respectively another novelty of the present simulator is the integration of a controller for determining a possible optimum route for a vessel moving to a target destination under the influence of disturbing forces as an additional aspect two different controllers namely pd and fuzzy like pd are used and their performances are compared passenger boats crossing the strait of istanbul are taken as the basis of these simulations six different cases involving travel of a vessels between two locations under cross currents are autopiloted by a classical pd and a fuzzy like pd controllers separately for three different current speeds routes dictated by these controllers are compared to those of human steered passenger boat which were recorded during a field study comparisons favour the performance of the fuzzy like pd controller due to its relatively shorter paths and accuracy of targeting the destination 2 governing equations of ship manoeuvring and assumptions differential equations governing ship manoeuvring are consist of force and moment expressions representing surge sway and yaw motions in the horizontal plane with no roll pitch and heave thus while the complete motions of a ship have 6 degrees of freedom dof the manoeuvring equations have 3 dof euler s equations of motion expressed in terms of coordinates fixed to the origin o at the mid length of moving vehicle whose motion is restricted to horizontal x y plane as shown in fig 1 are given by 6 p 467 1 m u v r x g r 2 x u v r u v r δ m v u r x g r y u v r u v r δ i z z ψ m x g v u r n u v r u v r δ where u and v are the instantaneous velocities respectively in the x and y directions m the mass of the ship i z z the mass moment of inertia with respect to the vertical axis at the centre of gravity of the ship x y the longitudinal and transverse hydrodynamic forces acting on the ship n the hydrodynamic moment r ψ the angular velocity of the ship or the yawing rate δ the rudder angle and x g the horizontal distance between the origin o and the centre of gravity of the ship overdot denotes differentiation with respect to time the usual assumptions of manoeuvring and course keeping modelling are made specifically the ship is taken as a rigid body with port starboard symmetry the lateral velocity of the ship is regarded small compared to the cruising speed while the metacentric height is large enough to ensure the ship s stability hydrodynamics forces acting on the ship are treated as quasi steady the effects of rolling pitching and heaving on manoeuvring are neglected and wave making effects are ignored completely in turning and zigzag tests no external forces at all are applied other than the appropriate rudder force course keeping simulations of a boat crossing the bosphorus on the other hand are performed under two different controllers while the ship is subject to a lateral current force and turning moment proportional to the current speed any other external disturbance such as wave and wind forces and moments acting on the ship can be implemented in exactly the same manner finally numerical solutions of the governing equations both for the abkowitz and mmg model are accomplished in a coupled manner by the default integrator of the simulink 2 1 abkowitz model basically there are two approaches of expressing the hydrodynamic forces acting on a ship the older one is the abkowitz method which expresses x y and n as taylor series the relatively recent and currently preferred one is the manoeuvring modelling group model or briefly the mmg approach which decomposes the forces and moment into several sub components and expresses especially the propeller and rudder forces by semi empirical formulas in this work the programming is done to comprise both methods so that the user can select the appropriate model for the purposes for instance if all the hydrodynamic derivatives are available from experiments or by some other means as in 3 the abkowitz method may be preferred on the other hand if only the main characteristics of the ship are available the mmg method with empirical expressions for each force component is a better choice for the abkowitz method or the so called whole ship method the present algorithm uses the following third order taylor series expansions for the total hydrodynamic forces and moment 6 p 680 2 m x u u x m y v v m x g y r r y n v m x g v i z z n r r n the right hand side of equation 2 can be written as 3 x x 0 x

cruising speed u in other words x 0 represents the total ship resistance at the speed u in the longitudinal direction δ u u u is the relatively small variation of instantaneous ship speed u from the cruising speed u and x u is the so called added mass in the x direction arising from the acceleration or deceleration u of the ship detailed explanations concerning the remaining terms may be found in comstock 1986 2 2 mmg model the mmg model was developed by japanese researchers hence most material on this model is in japanese the earliest contribution in english may be attributed to ogawa and kasai 1978 while relatively recent ones are yoshimura 2005 and yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 many researchers working in the field have been preferring the mmg model for practical reasons it is more popular aksu and köse 2017 sukas et al 2019a xia et al 2018 equations of manoeuvring motions according to the mmg model are expressed as 4 m m x u m m y v r m x g r 2 x m m y v m m x u r m x g r y i z z m x g 2 j z z r m x g v u r n where m x and m y denote respectively the added masses in the x and y directions and j z z stands for the added mass moment of inertia the mmg approach separates the total force components and moment into different modules typically three components which are associated with the ship hull propeller and rudder are considered in this work additionally the external forces and moment due to currents are included as the algorithm developed aims at autopiloting a ship under disturbing forces denoting these components by the subscripts h p r and c respectively the total forces and moment are decomposed as 5 x x h x p x r x c y y h y p y r y c n n h n p n r n c hydrodynamic forces x h and y h and moment n h acting on the ship hull may be expressed as x h r 0 x v

resistance force at constant cruising speed u in the x direction note that the lateral hull force and moment are taken to the third order which is reported to perform better compared to the second order aksu and köse 2017 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 7 x p 1 t t y p 0 n p 0 where t is the propeller thrust and t the thrust reduction coefficient the trust t is related to the thrust coefficient k t by the relationship 8 t ρ n 2 d 4 k t j in which ρ is the seawater density n the propeller revolution per second d the propeller diameter and j the advance coefficient the thrust coefficient k t may be approximated by a second degree polynomial in j so that k t j k 0 k 1 j k 2 j 2 with k 0 k 1 and k 2 being the constants characterizing the propeller recalling that the advance coefficient j is defined as j v a n d and that the advance velocity v a is related to the ship speed v by v a v 1 w w being the wake coefficient give for the advance coefficient corresponding to the instantaneous ship speed u as j u 1 w n d depending on the ship characteristics the wake coefficient w is determined from appropriate empirical formulas also the wake coefficient for a ship advancing in a straight course is different from the wake coefficient corresponding to a ship in manoeuvring and they are related by empirical relations effective rudder forces and moment x r y r n r are given by 9 x r 1 t r f n sin δ y r 1 a h f n cos δ n r x r a h x h f n cos δ where δ is the rudder angle as indicated before t r and a h the coefficients representing interactions between rudder and hull x r 0 5 l p p the distance between amidship and the lateral force applied by the rudder x h the longitudinal coordinate of acting point of the additional lateral force due to propeller hull interaction the rudder normal force f n is given by 10 f n 1 2 ρ a r u r 2 f α sin α r in which a r is the rudder area u r u r 2 v r 2 the inflow velocity to the rudder with u r and v r being the longitudinal and lateral inflow velocity components and α r δ arctan v r u r the effective inflow angle u r and v r can be determined with the aid of appropriate empirical relationships 30 p 41 42 hydrodynamic forces and moment acting on a ship due to a current flowing at an angle may be expressed as 9 p 155 11 x c 1 2 ρ a f c c x γ r c u c u c y c 1 2 ρ a l c c y γ r c v c v c n c 1 2 ρ a l c l o a c n γ r c v c v c where ρ is the density of seawater l o a is the length overall a f c and a l c are respectively the frontal and lateral projected areas of the ship exposed to the current u c and v c the components of current velocity v c on x axes and y axes the angle γ r c and the component velocities are given by 12 u c v c cos γ c v c v c sin γ c γ r c β c ψ where v c u c 2 v c 2 is the current velocity β c the direction of the ocean current and ψ the heading angle which is used in updating the current force coefficients at every time step it is possible to express the current coefficients c x γ r c c y γ r c and c n γ r c as polynomials in γ r c by establishing best fit to the curves given in fig 2 9 p 154 note that these coefficients are strictly valid for a tanker but may provide acceptable values for other ship types 3 numerical solutions of manoeuvring equations for benchmark tests depending on the availability of parameters the abkowitz model equations 2 and 3 or the mmg model equations 4 and 5 is numerically solved using a matlab simulink code which is specifically developed for simulating the manoeuvres of a ship under external disturbances the solution modules created in simulink for the abkowitz and mmg models are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively in order to test the reliability and accuracy of the numerical solver benchmark tests for two different vessels are carried out the first test is the turning test for 35 o rudder angles for two separate runs the second test is the zigzag manoeuvre performed by applying 10 o rudder angles alternately thus two benchmark tests are simulated for two different vessels by employing the abkowitz and mmg models separately to each vessel 3 1 tests of a fishing vessel using abkowitz model the benchmark tests of a fishing vessel are done by the use of the abkowitz model the main characteristics and hydrodynamic coefficients of the fishing vessel città di genova studied extensively by obreja et al 2010 are given in tables 1 and 2 respectively note that the hydrodynamic coefficients include the propeller and rudder derivatives hence supply all the necessary quantities for running the abkowitz model the non dimensional coefficients presented in table 2 are converted to dimensional coefficients by the use of conversion factors given in table 3 the graph of turning tests of the fishing vessel for 35 o rudder angles is displayed in fig 5 in accord with the nature of the abkowitz model the turning circles are completely symmetric about the vertical axis this symmetry is not observed in the turning tests simulated via the mmg model which produces more realistic results by taking into account the effect of propeller rotation table 4 presents the turning test parameters as computed by obreja et al 2010 the tribon code which was also presented in obreja et al 2010 and the present code overall the present work agrees well with obreja et al 2010 while the tribon code differs appreciably from both of these the only exception is the steady turning diameter for which the present code differs from the other two to comment on the sources of differences is difficult presumably all the programs use the same equations and the same hydrodynamics coefficients but the results are not the same nevertheless some meaningful considerations can be put forward the tactical and steady diameters of obreja et al 2010 are nearly the same and this does not sound quite reasonable on the other hand if a ratio is established between the tactical diameters of the present work and tribon code 3 03 3 93 0 77 the present work should have a steady diameter of 3 09 0 77 2 38 which is not much different from the computed value of 2 49 such reasoning is meaningful as the tribon code has consistently greater results compared to the present work the second benchmark test is the zigzag manoeuvre which is simulated by applying 10 o rudder angles alternately the graph in fig 6 depicts the experimental measurement black line and the numerical simulation employing the abkowitz method red line the rudder angle δ blue line is also drawn as a reference for determining the overshoot angles overall the simulation is in quite acceptable agreement with the measurement hence the reliability of the present code is established especially when the results of turning test are also considered 3 2 tests of kvlcc2 tanker using mmg model tests parallel to the previous subsection are now carried out for the kvlcc2 tanker using the mmg model the particulars and hydrodynamic coefficients of the kvlcc2 tanker as studied by yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 are given in tables 5 and 6 respectively for this case the mmg model is more suitable because the propeller and rudder coefficients are not provided and these parameters must be determined by empirical means the non dimensional coefficients given in table 6 are converted to dimensional coefficients by the use of conversion factors given in table 7 turning tests of the kvlcc2 tanker for 35 o rudder angles are shown in fig 7 note that the turning circles are not symmetric about the vertical axis this asymmetry is typical for the turning tests simulated by employing the mmg model due to the difference in steering parameters which take into account the effect of propeller rotation table 8 gives definite turning test parameters as computed by marin fr simman 2008 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 sukas et al 2019b and the present code while marin fr and sukas et al 2019b have a good overall agreement the computations of the present work agree better with those of yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 as for the corresponding simulation of the fishing vessel it is not easy to determine the reason or reasons for two distinct grouping of results nevertheless a reasonable agreement among all computations is obvious as for the fishing vessel the zigzag manoeuvre for the kvlcc2 tanker is simulated by applying 10 o rudder angles alternately since no experimental or actual measurement is available for this vessel the simulation of yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 black line is plotted together with the present simulation red line in fig 8 for comparison quite similar to the good agreement observed for the turning test parameters the zigzag manoeuvre simulation of the present code agrees well with that of yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 after conducting these benchmark tests with two different methods for two different vessels with acceptable results it is probably safe to declare the present code reliable 4 pd and fuzzy like pd controllers recent technological achievements have made the controllers a very important part of industrial applications a controller is basically a feedback mechanism which adjusts the control variable such that the error between the obtained and desired output is minimized currently more than 90 of controllers are proportional integral derivative pid controllers or varieties of pid controllers proportional p and integral i modes alone can be used as single modes but the use of derivative d mode alone is uncommon depending on the characteristics of application proportional integral pi and proportional derivative pd combinations are most commonly used pid type controllers are preferred in wide range of application areas such as vehicle control electronic appliances etc as they are simple effective and reliable a pid controller consists of three controls namely a proportional control u t k p e t an integral control u t k i 0 t e τ d τ and a derivative control u t k d d e t d t here u t is the control force input to the system e t r t y t is the error between the desired reference signal and actual output signal johnson and moradi 2005 performance of pid type controllers can be enhanced by introducing a fuzzy logic block for the decision making process fuzzy logic brings a definite artificial intelligence into the pid controller thus increasing the effectiveness of it the performance of fuzzy like pid controllers are better with self tuning abilities and adaptation to uncertain time dependent non linear systems feng and x k 2018 le et al 2004 in the present work two controllers a pd and a fuzzy like pd are separately incorporated into the simulink code developed the selected controller steers the ship by dictating the rudder angle while the simulink manoeuvring code simultaneously computes the path of the ship thus the route under external disturbances can be computed and the ship is guided to a desired terminal point by the controller like the manoeuvring code which uses two different methods abkowitz and mmg the controller has two options pd and fuzzy like pd for operating the vessel 4 1 determination of transfer function the transfer function representing the behaviour of a system to a given input is required for the operation of a controller a frequently used simple but accurate transfer function for the rudder control of a ship is the first order nomoto model nomoto et al 1957 which is defined as 14 r δ s k 1 t s where k the so called nomoto gain constant t the time constant and δ the rudder angle r ψ as defined before in terms of the heading angle ψ equation 14 becomes moreira et al 2005 15 ψ δ s k 1 t 3 s s 1 t 1 s 1 t 2 s k s 1 t s to be able to use the transfer function the constants must be determined for the ship considered clarke 2003 related the zigzag manoeuvres of a ship to the first order nomoto transfer function so that k and t could be calculated from the actual zigzag manoeuvre tests or numerical simulations accordingly k is calculated from k ψ 1 ψ 2 t 1 t 2 δ d t where ψ 1 and ψ 2 are the first and second heading overshoot angles and t 1 and t 2 are the corresponding instants of the 20 20 zigzag manoeuvre t 1 t 2 δ d t is the total area under rudder command within the given time interval the 20 20 zigzag test simulation strictly speaking the actual instantaneous rudder angles should be used for computing the shaded area but here as a good approximation the idealized rudder commands which are taken to be identical with the actual rudder angles are used to compute this area once k is calculated t is obtained from k t r 3 r 4 t 3 t 4 δ d t where r 3 and r 4 are the angular velocities of heading at the zero heading angles with t 3 and t 4 being the corresponding times for the fishing vessel città di genova considered in 3 1 using the 20 20 zigzag manoeuvring simulation at u 10 knots give k 0 184 s 1 and t 6 816 s as the constants of the first order nomoto model simulations presented in 5 2 had first been carried out by employing the nomoto model which gave quite acceptable results nevertheless a more practical and accurate way of obtaining the transfer function is possible inclusion of non linear effects and better performance for high frequencies large perturbations requiring frequent adjustments are achieved by a transfer function that can be obtained from matlab function linmod again using the zigzag test validated in 3 1 for the fishing vessel citta di genova the open loop transfer function is obtained as follows 16 ψ δ s g s 0 01666 s 0 00793 s 3 0 2548 s 2 0 02366 s the above transfer function g s is used in the simulations presented in 5 2 equation 16 is observed to perform better than the nomoto transfer function 15 which is validated only for constant heading and ship speed skjetne 2003 the corresponding closed loop system shown in fig 9 has the transfer function 17 c s r s g s 1 g s h s where c s is the output heading angle and r s the input rudder angle g s the open loop transfer function given by 16 h s the feedback transfer function which is taken as h s 1 in the present simulink code applying the routh hurwitz stability criterium to the closed loop system reveals that the system is stable hence controllable an uncertainty analysis considering the effects of variations in disturbance signals specifically external forces for the present case and system parameters that define the transfer function would be desirable however such an analysis is a separate work in itself usually subject of an individual study hence exceeds the limits of present work 4 2 determination of rudder angle a pd controller as indicated above has a proportional and a derivative control denoting e t as the error between the desired heading angle ψ d and the instantaneous heading angle ψ the rudder angle is computed from 18 δ t k p e t k d d e t d t where k p and k d are the proportional and derivative control constants with numerical values of 1 52 and 17 29 respectively for the present simulations the desired heading angle is computed according to the instantaneous ship position x s p y s p and the destination point x d p y d p 19 ψ d arctan y d p y s p x d p x s p since the heading angle ψ is known at every step of simulation and ψ d is calculated from 19 the error e t ψ d ψ can be determined and used in equation 18 to obtain δ at each time step fig 10 shows the block diagram for the rudder angle determination with pd and fuzzy like pd controls 5 autopiloting across a narrow strait with currents the strait of istanbul or the bosphorus is among the few narrow sea passages in the world with challenging currents every day hundreds of passenger boats ferries yachts ships tankers roam about in the strait crossing and re crossing between the european and asian sides of istanbul or between the sea of marmara and black sea a photograph of the bosphorus taken from üsküdar at the asian side with the view of beşiktaş across the strait at the european side is given in fig 11 busy sea traffic especially between the continents offers readily accessible and interesting observation possibilities of the routes followed by ships to this end field observations and records of routes of passenger boats frequently crossing the bosphorus between beşiktaş european side and üsküdar asian side were planned the aim of these actual field observations was to determine the paths followed by captains to steer their vessels to a nearby destination point under the disturbing effect of a more or less steady unidirectional current once these routes have been determined they could be compared with autopiloted simulations of a similar vessel for the same case this part of the present work precisely carries out such a plan 5 1 recordings of routes of a passenger boat crossing bosphorus the strait of istanbul has a two layer flow regime with the upper layer flowing from the black sea towards the sea of marmara and the lower layer in the opposite direction the upper layer flow is termed barotropic as it is forced by the pressure difference arising from water level difference at either ends of the channel on the other hand the lower layer flow is termed baroclinic and essentially is a result of the density difference between two layers although the upper layer flow is occasionally blocked due to strong opposing winds the usual two layer flow regime is maintained most of the time the current velocity in the upper layer basically in the south west direction varies between 1 to 2 knots 0 5 1 m s but may occasionally reach 4 knots 2 m s and even more beji et al 2018 on february 25 2020 a field survey was conducted by recording the routes of a relatively small passenger boat of 37 m length for three round trips across the strait of istanbul between beşiktaş europena side and üsküdar asian side during the survey the sea was a bit choppy as could be noted from fig 11 which also shows the boat travelled but otherwise made no appreciable effect on vessels the current speed was put within the range 1 2 knots by the boat captain in total six crossings were done three from the european side to asian side and three in the opposite direction instantaneous co ordinates of the boat trip were continuously recorded in time via a mobile phone application of google fig 12 shows two of the routes recorded while travelling from beşiktaş to üsküdar during one of these crossings a tanker making her way to the black sea obstructed the passage of the passenger boat and forced her to make a substantial detour therefore this particular recording of the path has been excluded from fig 12 the recorded routes from üsküdar to beşiktaş are shown in fig 13 the prominent feature of the recorded paths is their arch like appearance considering that the current direction is from left to right in the figures reason for bending of the paths to either sides may be questioned the answer lies with the initial heading of the boat which is dictated by the sea traffic at the time thus if the captain is forced to head against current at the start then the entire path becomes a curve bent in the direction of current otherwise the bent is in the opposite direction this particular feature also confirms the symmetrical nature of the problem when crossing a channel with a uniform current perpendicular to the travel direction to reach a destination directly ahead it is equally plausible to follow one of the two choices first the initial heading of the boat can be against the current at an angle with the target so that deviation from the straight path becomes maximum in the middle of the channel the boat then shifts her heading away from the current back towards the target second the initial heading of the boat can be in the direction of the current and not against it thus the boat follows a path which is a mirror image of the first path about the line connecting departure and arrival points in the first case then the boats fights against the current halfway of the route and then goes with it in the second case the boat goes halfway with the current and then fights against it 5 2 controlled simulations of a vessel crossing bosphorus controlled simulations of a vessel travelling under conditions similar to those of the bosphorus are now presented for different current speeds pd and fuzzy like pd controllers are used separately by coupling each one with the present numerical manoeuvring code in terms of general characteristics the fishing vessel città di genova tested in 3 1 is considered reasonably well comparable with a typical passenger boat operating in the bosphorus thus knowing all the hydrodynamic properties for manoeuvring and having already obtained in 4 1 the transfer function from matlab linmod the autopiloted simulations of this particular vessel can be carried out according to the case scenario the vessel is to travel from üsküdar to beşiktaş at constant velocity u 10 knots in line with the speed of the boat travelled in field survey the current velocity is assumed uniform across the strait of istanbul and the simulations are done for three different current velocities namely v c 1 1 5 and 2 knots since two different controllers pd and fuzzy like pd are employed six different simulations are carried out fig 14 shows the changes in the rudder angle during each trip for pd and fuzzy like pd controllers for three different current speeds figs 15 17 show the simulations for v c 1 1 5 and 2 knots red and blue lines trace the paths taken under pd and fuzzy like pd controls respectively as the ship begins its trip parallel to the channel with a heading angle 90 o to the target direction fuzzy like pd makes sharper adjustments compared to the pd alone but as the ship more or less settles to its route around t 10 s the control of fuzzy like pd becomes smoother table 9 presents certain quantities obtained from simulations for different current velocities in order to compare the performances of pd and fuzzy pd controllers in the table t denotes the duration of travel from the departure point to the destination in seconds x is the distance to the target straight ahead of the vessel and y is the sideways deviation distance from the target at the arrival point this deviation is zero if the vessel is precisely at the terminal point like figs 15 17 table 9 reveals definitely better performance for the fuzzy like pd in terms of both the travel duration and the proximity of terminal point of simulation to the targeted location nevertheless the routes dictated by both the pd and the fuzzy like pd controller are within the paths taken by human piloting shown in figs 12 and 13 the maximum deviation for human piloting is around 135 m for approximately v c 1 5 knots as estimated by the boat captain the corresponding autopiloted trip has around 32 m of maximum deviation for the pd controller and the fuzzy like pd is less than 20 m we must however be fair in our judgement of the human piloting and indicate that the greater part of the deviations from the route is caused by the sea traffic present as observed during trips 6 concluding remarks a simulink code has been created for the numerical solution of manoeuvring equations of a surface vessel the code offers both the abkowitz and mmg model as options to the user so that according to the available data for the vessel considered the appropriate model can be selected benchmarks tests for two different ships have been carried out by the use of abkowitz and mmg model separately comparisons of test results with other sources give confidence for the code developed real time records of the position of a passenger boat crossing the strait of istanbul have been taken via a mobile application of google autopilot simulations for a similar vessel guided by the pd and fuzzy like pd controls operating with the simulink code have been carried out the heading hence the route is determined by controlling the rudder angle at each time step according to the current status of the ship in relation to the destination in comparison with pd controller paths dictated by the fuzzy like pd controller define relatively less deviated shorter routes in closing research works such as the present one can be expected to lay the general framework upon which more sophisticated and detailed actual control systems can be built credit authorship contribution statement g budak responsible for methodology carrying out the work software field observations and measurements writing

21333,a simulink code for numerical simulation of ship manoeuvring is developed based on the appropriate differential equations both the abkowitz and mmg models are implemented as choices according to the available hydrodynamic particulars of a given ship reliability of the developed code is assessed by performing the turning and zigzag tests for two different ships employing the abkowitz and mmg models in turn according to the available characteristics as a field study real time records of the routes followed by a passenger ship crossing the strait of istanbul under the disturbing effect of a lateral current were made one of the vessels tested was autopiloted by a classic pd and a fuzzy like pd controller separately guiding the ship to a target destination under cross current as in the strait of istanbul performances of these controllers in comparison with the human piloting of the field observations reveal that under disturbing current effects both controllers provide relatively shorter travel paths and the fuzzy like pd controller stands as a better choice between the two keywords ship manoeuvring ship control under disturbances pd controller fuzzy controller nomenclature β

temporary variations of a sea state impose time dependent disturbing forces to a sea going vessel and consequently necessitate appropriate corrections to steer the vessel to a desired location while continuously monitoring external conditions with the advent of various branches of engineering customarily human piloting of a vessel has been advancing towards auto piloting likewise if a vessel is required to remain at a certain point the actions taken are considered as dynamic positioning both tasks of piloting and positioning fall into the realm of ship manoeuvring which in turn implies a set of time dependent differential equations with definite controllable terms representing steering forces and moments thus the entire problem may be viewed as composed of two main parts first solving the differential equations governing ship manoeuvring and second determining the appropriate commands to the control terms all these of course are performed in a coupled manner by taking into account responses of the vessel as feedback since the early 1960 s ship manoeuvring has been among intensely studies areas of naval architecture reasons for devoting such considerable efforts to the subject may be attributed to a variety of parameters involved in modelling the ship manoeuvring to begin with hydrodynamic behaviour of a ship in motion depends closely on her particular form and this dependency must be formulated for different motions determination of external forces due to waves and currents for a varying sea state poses another challenge moreover there are the wind forces acting on the superstructure it is therefore not surprising that an enormous literature has been accumulated in these and related subjects as presented in a relatively recent review in hirdaris et al 2014 increasing computational capabilities have led to more detailed investigations by numerical means a simulink based marine control system was described in detail by perez et al 2006 moreira fossen and soares moreira et al 2007 presented a path following control system for a surface vessel with particular reference to a possible future application to esso osaka tanker seo and kim 2011 simulated coupled ship manoeuvring and motions in presence of waves slow steaming performance of a ship in waves was considered in tezdoğan et al tezdogan et al 2015 with the aim of reducing operational costs in a study concerning ship optimization tahara et al 2006 manoeuvrability performance was included among multiple objectives of the optimization process kim et al 2017 investigated the added resistance of kvlcc2 ship in head seas for various speeds and wave conditions kurowski köckritz and korte kurowski et al 2013 presented a comprehensive manoeuvring planning system for marine vessels travel duration and fuel consumption were used to determine the optimum route of a vessel by fang and lin 2015 for efficiency and economy as early as 1977 källström et al 1977 suggested two adaptive autopilots simple and advanced to reduce the fuel consumption of tankers çimen and banks cimen and banks 2004 developed optimal tracking controllers for non linear systems and applied these on the esso oil tanker claiming better efficiency compared to manual open loop operation relatively recently bhattacharya et al 2011 proposed a fuzzy autopilot control for ship manoeuvring in the absence of external forces the present work introduces a simulink code for ship manoeuvring simulations with choices of the abkowitz and mmg models inclusion of two different methods a novelty of the present work makes the code a versatile tool that can be switched to either model depending on the available hydrodynamic characteristics of the ship in order to test the proper working of each model the benchmark tests are done by considering two vessels with parameters suitable for the abkowitz and mmg models respectively another novelty of the present simulator is the integration of a controller for determining a possible optimum route for a vessel moving to a target destination under the influence of disturbing forces as an additional aspect two different controllers namely pd and fuzzy like pd are used and their performances are compared passenger boats crossing the strait of istanbul are taken as the basis of these simulations six different cases involving travel of a vessels between two locations under cross currents are autopiloted by a classical pd and a fuzzy like pd controllers separately for three different current speeds routes dictated by these controllers are compared to those of human steered passenger boat which were recorded during a field study comparisons favour the performance of the fuzzy like pd controller due to its relatively shorter paths and accuracy of targeting the destination 2 governing equations of ship manoeuvring and assumptions differential equations governing ship manoeuvring are consist of force and moment expressions representing surge sway and yaw motions in the horizontal plane with no roll pitch and heave thus while the complete motions of a ship have 6 degrees of freedom dof the manoeuvring equations have 3 dof euler s equations of motion expressed in terms of coordinates fixed to the origin o at the mid length of moving vehicle whose motion is restricted to horizontal x y plane as shown in fig 1 are given by 6 p 467 1 m u v r x g r 2 x u v r u v r δ m v u r x g r y u v r u v r δ i z z ψ m x g v u r n u v r u v r δ where u and v are the instantaneous velocities respectively in the x and y directions m the mass of the ship i z z the mass moment of inertia with respect to the vertical axis at the centre of gravity of the ship x y the longitudinal and transverse hydrodynamic forces acting on the ship n the hydrodynamic moment r ψ the angular velocity of the ship or the yawing rate δ the rudder angle and x g the horizontal distance between the origin o and the centre of gravity of the ship overdot denotes differentiation with respect to time the usual assumptions of manoeuvring and course keeping modelling are made specifically the ship is taken as a rigid body with port starboard symmetry the lateral velocity of the ship is regarded small compared to the cruising speed while the metacentric height is large enough to ensure the ship s stability hydrodynamics forces acting on the ship are treated as quasi steady the effects of rolling pitching and heaving on manoeuvring are neglected and wave making effects are ignored completely in turning and zigzag tests no external forces at all are applied other than the appropriate rudder force course keeping simulations of a boat crossing the bosphorus on the other hand are performed under two different controllers while the ship is subject to a lateral current force and turning moment proportional to the current speed any other external disturbance such as wave and wind forces and moments acting on the ship can be implemented in exactly the same manner finally numerical solutions of the governing equations both for the abkowitz and mmg model are accomplished in a coupled manner by the default integrator of the simulink 2 1 abkowitz model basically there are two approaches of expressing the hydrodynamic forces acting on a ship the older one is the abkowitz method which expresses x y and n as taylor series the relatively recent and currently preferred one is the manoeuvring modelling group model or briefly the mmg approach which decomposes the forces and moment into several sub components and expresses especially the propeller and rudder forces by semi empirical formulas in this work the programming is done to comprise both methods so that the user can select the appropriate model for the purposes for instance if all the hydrodynamic derivatives are available from experiments or by some other means as in 3 the abkowitz method may be preferred on the other hand if only the main characteristics of the ship are available the mmg method with empirical expressions for each force component is a better choice for the abkowitz method or the so called whole ship method the present algorithm uses the following third order taylor series expansions for the total hydrodynamic forces and moment 6 p 680 2 m x u u x m y v v m x g y r r y n v m x g v i z z n r r n the right hand side of equation 2 can be written as 3 x x 0 x

cruising speed u in other words x 0 represents the total ship resistance at the speed u in the longitudinal direction δ u u u is the relatively small variation of instantaneous ship speed u from the cruising speed u and x u is the so called added mass in the x direction arising from the acceleration or deceleration u of the ship detailed explanations concerning the remaining terms may be found in comstock 1986 2 2 mmg model the mmg model was developed by japanese researchers hence most material on this model is in japanese the earliest contribution in english may be attributed to ogawa and kasai 1978 while relatively recent ones are yoshimura 2005 and yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 many researchers working in the field have been preferring the mmg model for practical reasons it is more popular aksu and köse 2017 sukas et al 2019a xia et al 2018 equations of manoeuvring motions according to the mmg model are expressed as 4 m m x u m m y v r m x g r 2 x m m y v m m x u r m x g r y i z z m x g 2 j z z r m x g v u r n where m x and m y denote respectively the added masses in the x and y directions and j z z stands for the added mass moment of inertia the mmg approach separates the total force components and moment into different modules typically three components which are associated with the ship hull propeller and rudder are considered in this work additionally the external forces and moment due to currents are included as the algorithm developed aims at autopiloting a ship under disturbing forces denoting these components by the subscripts h p r and c respectively the total forces and moment are decomposed as 5 x x h x p x r x c y y h y p y r y c n n h n p n r n c hydrodynamic forces x h and y h and moment n h acting on the ship hull may be expressed as x h r 0 x v

resistance force at constant cruising speed u in the x direction note that the lateral hull force and moment are taken to the third order which is reported to perform better compared to the second order aksu and köse 2017 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 7 x p 1 t t y p 0 n p 0 where t is the propeller thrust and t the thrust reduction coefficient the trust t is related to the thrust coefficient k t by the relationship 8 t ρ n 2 d 4 k t j in which ρ is the seawater density n the propeller revolution per second d the propeller diameter and j the advance coefficient the thrust coefficient k t may be approximated by a second degree polynomial in j so that k t j k 0 k 1 j k 2 j 2 with k 0 k 1 and k 2 being the constants characterizing the propeller recalling that the advance coefficient j is defined as j v a n d and that the advance velocity v a is related to the ship speed v by v a v 1 w w being the wake coefficient give for the advance coefficient corresponding to the instantaneous ship speed u as j u 1 w n d depending on the ship characteristics the wake coefficient w is determined from appropriate empirical formulas also the wake coefficient for a ship advancing in a straight course is different from the wake coefficient corresponding to a ship in manoeuvring and they are related by empirical relations effective rudder forces and moment x r y r n r are given by 9 x r 1 t r f n sin δ y r 1 a h f n cos δ n r x r a h x h f n cos δ where δ is the rudder angle as indicated before t r and a h the coefficients representing interactions between rudder and hull x r 0 5 l p p the distance between amidship and the lateral force applied by the rudder x h the longitudinal coordinate of acting point of the additional lateral force due to propeller hull interaction the rudder normal force f n is given by 10 f n 1 2 ρ a r u r 2 f α sin α r in which a r is the rudder area u r u r 2 v r 2 the inflow velocity to the rudder with u r and v r being the longitudinal and lateral inflow velocity components and α r δ arctan v r u r the effective inflow angle u r and v r can be determined with the aid of appropriate empirical relationships 30 p 41 42 hydrodynamic forces and moment acting on a ship due to a current flowing at an angle may be expressed as 9 p 155 11 x c 1 2 ρ a f c c x γ r c u c u c y c 1 2 ρ a l c c y γ r c v c v c n c 1 2 ρ a l c l o a c n γ r c v c v c where ρ is the density of seawater l o a is the length overall a f c and a l c are respectively the frontal and lateral projected areas of the ship exposed to the current u c and v c the components of current velocity v c on x axes and y axes the angle γ r c and the component velocities are given by 12 u c v c cos γ c v c v c sin γ c γ r c β c ψ where v c u c 2 v c 2 is the current velocity β c the direction of the ocean current and ψ the heading angle which is used in updating the current force coefficients at every time step it is possible to express the current coefficients c x γ r c c y γ r c and c n γ r c as polynomials in γ r c by establishing best fit to the curves given in fig 2 9 p 154 note that these coefficients are strictly valid for a tanker but may provide acceptable values for other ship types 3 numerical solutions of manoeuvring equations for benchmark tests depending on the availability of parameters the abkowitz model equations 2 and 3 or the mmg model equations 4 and 5 is numerically solved using a matlab simulink code which is specifically developed for simulating the manoeuvres of a ship under external disturbances the solution modules created in simulink for the abkowitz and mmg models are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively in order to test the reliability and accuracy of the numerical solver benchmark tests for two different vessels are carried out the first test is the turning test for 35 o rudder angles for two separate runs the second test is the zigzag manoeuvre performed by applying 10 o rudder angles alternately thus two benchmark tests are simulated for two different vessels by employing the abkowitz and mmg models separately to each vessel 3 1 tests of a fishing vessel using abkowitz model the benchmark tests of a fishing vessel are done by the use of the abkowitz model the main characteristics and hydrodynamic coefficients of the fishing vessel città di genova studied extensively by obreja et al 2010 are given in tables 1 and 2 respectively note that the hydrodynamic coefficients include the propeller and rudder derivatives hence supply all the necessary quantities for running the abkowitz model the non dimensional coefficients presented in table 2 are converted to dimensional coefficients by the use of conversion factors given in table 3 the graph of turning tests of the fishing vessel for 35 o rudder angles is displayed in fig 5 in accord with the nature of the abkowitz model the turning circles are completely symmetric about the vertical axis this symmetry is not observed in the turning tests simulated via the mmg model which produces more realistic results by taking into account the effect of propeller rotation table 4 presents the turning test parameters as computed by obreja et al 2010 the tribon code which was also presented in obreja et al 2010 and the present code overall the present work agrees well with obreja et al 2010 while the tribon code differs appreciably from both of these the only exception is the steady turning diameter for which the present code differs from the other two to comment on the sources of differences is difficult presumably all the programs use the same equations and the same hydrodynamics coefficients but the results are not the same nevertheless some meaningful considerations can be put forward the tactical and steady diameters of obreja et al 2010 are nearly the same and this does not sound quite reasonable on the other hand if a ratio is established between the tactical diameters of the present work and tribon code 3 03 3 93 0 77 the present work should have a steady diameter of 3 09 0 77 2 38 which is not much different from the computed value of 2 49 such reasoning is meaningful as the tribon code has consistently greater results compared to the present work the second benchmark test is the zigzag manoeuvre which is simulated by applying 10 o rudder angles alternately the graph in fig 6 depicts the experimental measurement black line and the numerical simulation employing the abkowitz method red line the rudder angle δ blue line is also drawn as a reference for determining the overshoot angles overall the simulation is in quite acceptable agreement with the measurement hence the reliability of the present code is established especially when the results of turning test are also considered 3 2 tests of kvlcc2 tanker using mmg model tests parallel to the previous subsection are now carried out for the kvlcc2 tanker using the mmg model the particulars and hydrodynamic coefficients of the kvlcc2 tanker as studied by yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 are given in tables 5 and 6 respectively for this case the mmg model is more suitable because the propeller and rudder coefficients are not provided and these parameters must be determined by empirical means the non dimensional coefficients given in table 6 are converted to dimensional coefficients by the use of conversion factors given in table 7 turning tests of the kvlcc2 tanker for 35 o rudder angles are shown in fig 7 note that the turning circles are not symmetric about the vertical axis this asymmetry is typical for the turning tests simulated by employing the mmg model due to the difference in steering parameters which take into account the effect of propeller rotation table 8 gives definite turning test parameters as computed by marin fr simman 2008 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 sukas et al 2019b and the present code while marin fr and sukas et al 2019b have a good overall agreement the computations of the present work agree better with those of yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 as for the corresponding simulation of the fishing vessel it is not easy to determine the reason or reasons for two distinct grouping of results nevertheless a reasonable agreement among all computations is obvious as for the fishing vessel the zigzag manoeuvre for the kvlcc2 tanker is simulated by applying 10 o rudder angles alternately since no experimental or actual measurement is available for this vessel the simulation of yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 black line is plotted together with the present simulation red line in fig 8 for comparison quite similar to the good agreement observed for the turning test parameters the zigzag manoeuvre simulation of the present code agrees well with that of yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 after conducting these benchmark tests with two different methods for two different vessels with acceptable results it is probably safe to declare the present code reliable 4 pd and fuzzy like pd controllers recent technological achievements have made the controllers a very important part of industrial applications a controller is basically a feedback mechanism which adjusts the control variable such that the error between the obtained and desired output is minimized currently more than 90 of controllers are proportional integral derivative pid controllers or varieties of pid controllers proportional p and integral i modes alone can be used as single modes but the use of derivative d mode alone is uncommon depending on the characteristics of application proportional integral pi and proportional derivative pd combinations are most commonly used pid type controllers are preferred in wide range of application areas such as vehicle control electronic appliances etc as they are simple effective and reliable a pid controller consists of three controls namely a proportional control u t k p e t an integral control u t k i 0 t e τ d τ and a derivative control u t k d d e t d t here u t is the control force input to the system e t r t y t is the error between the desired reference signal and actual output signal johnson and moradi 2005 performance of pid type controllers can be enhanced by introducing a fuzzy logic block for the decision making process fuzzy logic brings a definite artificial intelligence into the pid controller thus increasing the effectiveness of it the performance of fuzzy like pid controllers are better with self tuning abilities and adaptation to uncertain time dependent non linear systems feng and x k 2018 le et al 2004 in the present work two controllers a pd and a fuzzy like pd are separately incorporated into the simulink code developed the selected controller steers the ship by dictating the rudder angle while the simulink manoeuvring code simultaneously computes the path of the ship thus the route under external disturbances can be computed and the ship is guided to a desired terminal point by the controller like the manoeuvring code which uses two different methods abkowitz and mmg the controller has two options pd and fuzzy like pd for operating the vessel 4 1 determination of transfer function the transfer function representing the behaviour of a system to a given input is required for the operation of a controller a frequently used simple but accurate transfer function for the rudder control of a ship is the first order nomoto model nomoto et al 1957 which is defined as 14 r δ s k 1 t s where k the so called nomoto gain constant t the time constant and δ the rudder angle r ψ as defined before in terms of the heading angle ψ equation 14 becomes moreira et al 2005 15 ψ δ s k 1 t 3 s s 1 t 1 s 1 t 2 s k s 1 t s to be able to use the transfer function the constants must be determined for the ship considered clarke 2003 related the zigzag manoeuvres of a ship to the first order nomoto transfer function so that k and t could be calculated from the actual zigzag manoeuvre tests or numerical simulations accordingly k is calculated from k ψ 1 ψ 2 t 1 t 2 δ d t where ψ 1 and ψ 2 are the first and second heading overshoot angles and t 1 and t 2 are the corresponding instants of the 20 20 zigzag manoeuvre t 1 t 2 δ d t is the total area under rudder command within the given time interval the 20 20 zigzag test simulation strictly speaking the actual instantaneous rudder angles should be used for computing the shaded area but here as a good approximation the idealized rudder commands which are taken to be identical with the actual rudder angles are used to compute this area once k is calculated t is obtained from k t r 3 r 4 t 3 t 4 δ d t where r 3 and r 4 are the angular velocities of heading at the zero heading angles with t 3 and t 4 being the corresponding times for the fishing vessel città di genova considered in 3 1 using the 20 20 zigzag manoeuvring simulation at u 10 knots give k 0 184 s 1 and t 6 816 s as the constants of the first order nomoto model simulations presented in 5 2 had first been carried out by employing the nomoto model which gave quite acceptable results nevertheless a more practical and accurate way of obtaining the transfer function is possible inclusion of non linear effects and better performance for high frequencies large perturbations requiring frequent adjustments are achieved by a transfer function that can be obtained from matlab function linmod again using the zigzag test validated in 3 1 for the fishing vessel citta di genova the open loop transfer function is obtained as follows 16 ψ δ s g s 0 01666 s 0 00793 s 3 0 2548 s 2 0 02366 s the above transfer function g s is used in the simulations presented in 5 2 equation 16 is observed to perform better than the nomoto transfer function 15 which is validated only for constant heading and ship speed skjetne 2003 the corresponding closed loop system shown in fig 9 has the transfer function 17 c s r s g s 1 g s h s where c s is the output heading angle and r s the input rudder angle g s the open loop transfer function given by 16 h s the feedback transfer function which is taken as h s 1 in the present simulink code applying the routh hurwitz stability criterium to the closed loop system reveals that the system is stable hence controllable an uncertainty analysis considering the effects of variations in disturbance signals specifically external forces for the present case and system parameters that define the transfer function would be desirable however such an analysis is a separate work in itself usually subject of an individual study hence exceeds the limits of present work 4 2 determination of rudder angle a pd controller as indicated above has a proportional and a derivative control denoting e t as the error between the desired heading angle ψ d and the instantaneous heading angle ψ the rudder angle is computed from 18 δ t k p e t k d d e t d t where k p and k d are the proportional and derivative control constants with numerical values of 1 52 and 17 29 respectively for the present simulations the desired heading angle is computed according to the instantaneous ship position x s p y s p and the destination point x d p y d p 19 ψ d arctan y d p y s p x d p x s p since the heading angle ψ is known at every step of simulation and ψ d is calculated from 19 the error e t ψ d ψ can be determined and used in equation 18 to obtain δ at each time step fig 10 shows the block diagram for the rudder angle determination with pd and fuzzy like pd controls 5 autopiloting across a narrow strait with currents the strait of istanbul or the bosphorus is among the few narrow sea passages in the world with challenging currents every day hundreds of passenger boats ferries yachts ships tankers roam about in the strait crossing and re crossing between the european and asian sides of istanbul or between the sea of marmara and black sea a photograph of the bosphorus taken from üsküdar at the asian side with the view of beşiktaş across the strait at the european side is given in fig 11 busy sea traffic especially between the continents offers readily accessible and interesting observation possibilities of the routes followed by ships to this end field observations and records of routes of passenger boats frequently crossing the bosphorus between beşiktaş european side and üsküdar asian side were planned the aim of these actual field observations was to determine the paths followed by captains to steer their vessels to a nearby destination point under the disturbing effect of a more or less steady unidirectional current once these routes have been determined they could be compared with autopiloted simulations of a similar vessel for the same case this part of the present work precisely carries out such a plan 5 1 recordings of routes of a passenger boat crossing bosphorus the strait of istanbul has a two layer flow regime with the upper layer flowing from the black sea towards the sea of marmara and the lower layer in the opposite direction the upper layer flow is termed barotropic as it is forced by the pressure difference arising from water level difference at either ends of the channel on the other hand the lower layer flow is termed baroclinic and essentially is a result of the density difference between two layers although the upper layer flow is occasionally blocked due to strong opposing winds the usual two layer flow regime is maintained most of the time the current velocity in the upper layer basically in the south west direction varies between 1 to 2 knots 0 5 1 m s but may occasionally reach 4 knots 2 m s and even more beji et al 2018 on february 25 2020 a field survey was conducted by recording the routes of a relatively small passenger boat of 37 m length for three round trips across the strait of istanbul between beşiktaş europena side and üsküdar asian side during the survey the sea was a bit choppy as could be noted from fig 11 which also shows the boat travelled but otherwise made no appreciable effect on vessels the current speed was put within the range 1 2 knots by the boat captain in total six crossings were done three from the european side to asian side and three in the opposite direction instantaneous co ordinates of the boat trip were continuously recorded in time via a mobile phone application of google fig 12 shows two of the routes recorded while travelling from beşiktaş to üsküdar during one of these crossings a tanker making her way to the black sea obstructed the passage of the passenger boat and forced her to make a substantial detour therefore this particular recording of the path has been excluded from fig 12 the recorded routes from üsküdar to beşiktaş are shown in fig 13 the prominent feature of the recorded paths is their arch like appearance considering that the current direction is from left to right in the figures reason for bending of the paths to either sides may be questioned the answer lies with the initial heading of the boat which is dictated by the sea traffic at the time thus if the captain is forced to head against current at the start then the entire path becomes a curve bent in the direction of current otherwise the bent is in the opposite direction this particular feature also confirms the symmetrical nature of the problem when crossing a channel with a uniform current perpendicular to the travel direction to reach a destination directly ahead it is equally plausible to follow one of the two choices first the initial heading of the boat can be against the current at an angle with the target so that deviation from the straight path becomes maximum in the middle of the channel the boat then shifts her heading away from the current back towards the target second the initial heading of the boat can be in the direction of the current and not against it thus the boat follows a path which is a mirror image of the first path about the line connecting departure and arrival points in the first case then the boats fights against the current halfway of the route and then goes with it in the second case the boat goes halfway with the current and then fights against it 5 2 controlled simulations of a vessel crossing bosphorus controlled simulations of a vessel travelling under conditions similar to those of the bosphorus are now presented for different current speeds pd and fuzzy like pd controllers are used separately by coupling each one with the present numerical manoeuvring code in terms of general characteristics the fishing vessel città di genova tested in 3 1 is considered reasonably well comparable with a typical passenger boat operating in the bosphorus thus knowing all the hydrodynamic properties for manoeuvring and having already obtained in 4 1 the transfer function from matlab linmod the autopiloted simulations of this particular vessel can be carried out according to the case scenario the vessel is to travel from üsküdar to beşiktaş at constant velocity u 10 knots in line with the speed of the boat travelled in field survey the current velocity is assumed uniform across the strait of istanbul and the simulations are done for three different current velocities namely v c 1 1 5 and 2 knots since two different controllers pd and fuzzy like pd are employed six different simulations are carried out fig 14 shows the changes in the rudder angle during each trip for pd and fuzzy like pd controllers for three different current speeds figs 15 17 show the simulations for v c 1 1 5 and 2 knots red and blue lines trace the paths taken under pd and fuzzy like pd controls respectively as the ship begins its trip parallel to the channel with a heading angle 90 o to the target direction fuzzy like pd makes sharper adjustments compared to the pd alone but as the ship more or less settles to its route around t 10 s the control of fuzzy like pd becomes smoother table 9 presents certain quantities obtained from simulations for different current velocities in order to compare the performances of pd and fuzzy pd controllers in the table t denotes the duration of travel from the departure point to the destination in seconds x is the distance to the target straight ahead of the vessel and y is the sideways deviation distance from the target at the arrival point this deviation is zero if the vessel is precisely at the terminal point like figs 15 17 table 9 reveals definitely better performance for the fuzzy like pd in terms of both the travel duration and the proximity of terminal point of simulation to the targeted location nevertheless the routes dictated by both the pd and the fuzzy like pd controller are within the paths taken by human piloting shown in figs 12 and 13 the maximum deviation for human piloting is around 135 m for approximately v c 1 5 knots as estimated by the boat captain the corresponding autopiloted trip has around 32 m of maximum deviation for the pd controller and the fuzzy like pd is less than 20 m we must however be fair in our judgement of the human piloting and indicate that the greater part of the deviations from the route is caused by the sea traffic present as observed during trips 6 concluding remarks a simulink code has been created for the numerical solution of manoeuvring equations of a surface vessel the code offers both the abkowitz and mmg model as options to the user so that according to the available data for the vessel considered the appropriate model can be selected benchmarks tests for two different ships have been carried out by the use of abkowitz and mmg model separately comparisons of test results with other sources give confidence for the code developed real time records of the position of a passenger boat crossing the strait of istanbul have been taken via a mobile application of google autopilot simulations for a similar vessel guided by the pd and fuzzy like pd controls operating with the simulink code have been carried out the heading hence the route is determined by controlling the rudder angle at each time step according to the current status of the ship in relation to the destination in comparison with pd controller paths dictated by the fuzzy

21334,this paper proposes a novel data driven approach to estimate the navigable capacity of busy waterways focusing on ships entering and leaving port based on the structural characteristics of traffic flow driven by the automatic identification system ais data first we collect the ship traffic flow in a busy waterway by processing the original ais data and then identify the structural characteristics of the traffic flow using the k means clustering algorithm the clusters are constructed based on the spatiotemporal consumption of waterway resources of different ships and the waste of waterway resources caused by navigational mode conversion taking ship domain into consideration we apply the proposed approach to estimate the navigable capacity of the dagusha channel of tianjin port china the empirical results reveal that the maximum daily traffic capacity of the dagusha channel is about 109 ship times day a comparison of waterway capacity estimation methods demonstrates that our proposed approach is more accurate and able to quantify the waterway capacity of different types of ships in a busy waterway taking the structural characteristics of traffic flow explicitly into account the proposed approach provides support for the design of channel and determination of scheduling schemes for ships in busy waterways keywords automatic identification system navigable capacity estimation traffic flow structural characteristics use of marine resources 1 introduction with a constant increase in marine traffic during recent years the development of traffic supervision and management of busy waterways have been hindered by water traffic congestion marine safety is a major priority of waterborne transportation wan et al 2018 in order to prevent marine traffic congestion in busy waterways from causing ship collision accidents navigable capacity estimation marine traffic analysis ship behavior analysis and traffic complexity analysis have drawn increasing attention such studies are motivated by marine safety management aiming at better understanding the mechanism of how ship collision accidents occur in busy waterways the critical value of navigable capacity in busy waterways that may lead to ship collision and the driving factors behind the navigable capacity of a busy waterway james et al 2018 countermeasures could then be identified to manage marine traffic in order to effectively enhance waterway transportation safety with more massive maritime transportation the moving situation of ship traffic is becoming more complicated and varied showing the characteristics of the complex structure crisscrossing higher density and wider range under this circumstance the spatial and temporal distribution of ship traffic is the embodiment feature for perceiving the characteristics of ship traffic automatic identification system ais data are an essential data source for theestimation of traffic behaviors and navigable capacity of busy waterways the application of ais data has developed from simply navigation oriented research to more complex directions that combining traffic flow estimation ship travel behaviors and vessel performance monitoring svanberg et al 2019 since 2004 all passenger ships and ships over 300 gross tonnage gt have been fitted with ais transponders see iala 2004 2016 and imo 2014 imo 2003 satellites have been systematically used since 2008 to collect improved quality data from ais transceivers installed on ships worldwide yang et al 2019 with the improvement in quality and accessibility of ais data over the last few years maritime research has been expanded toward understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of ship traffic e g arguedas et al 2018 wang et al 2017 pallotta et al 2014

al 2014 longépé et al 2015 campana et al 2017 watson et al 2015 aase et al 2015 goerlandt et al 2017 in terms of ship traffic analysis the focuses were mainly on ship grounding and collision analysis e g montewka et al 2010 goerlandt and kujala 2011 goerlandt et al 2017 qu et al 2011 montewka et al 2014 near miss detections zhang et al 2015 2016 wang et al 2020 de boer 2010 and collision avoidance especially considering the recent interest in autonomous shipping operations szlapczynski et al 2018 based on ais data analytics the navigable capacity of busy waterways and traffic behaviors could be constructively analyzed using advanced data mining techniques in order to effectively enhance waterway transportation safety academic research should focus on systematically evaluating how to manage marine traffic ais data may be useful to analyze traffic densities and traffic complexity sidibé and shu 2017 lensu et al 2019 in the literature navigable capacity estimation has been widely used in the field of transportation engineering the characteristics of ship traffic and the complex structures of ship traffic are increasingly highlighted in the supervision of busy waterways meng et al 2014 bye et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 haranen et al 2017 in particular the structural characteristics of ship traffic flow are closely related to the navigation efficiency and service level of busy waterways coldwell 1981 goerlandt et al 2011 xiao et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 chen et al 2020 in this context it is of great importance to study the structural characteristics extraction of ship traffic in busy waterways and explores the spatiotemporal resource consumption characteristics of busy waters for improving the navigable capacity of busy waterways ji et al 2009 wong et al 2009 wang et al 2017 to this end a majority of the existing literature focuses on analyzing the restriction of operational conditions in busy waterways and the influence of the behavioral characteristics of ship traffic on navigable capacity goerlandt and kujala 2011 hasegawa 2009 ince topuz 2004 watanabe et al 2008 yeo et al 2007 yip 2013 for instance liu et al 2016 examined the main factors of image transmission and traffic popularity and studied the application of ship traffic flow characteristics in traffic organization meng et al 2014 used the ais information to analyze the ship traffic flow and ship arrival law in the singapore strait they developed a prediction model of ship traffic flow to quantify the navigable capacity of the singapore strait in addition statistical approaches are used to calculate the complexity characteristics based on traffic flow structural characteristics taking speed length and ship types into consideration sang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 2019 2020 chen et al 2019a zhang et al 2016 while the composition of ship traffic flow structure characteristic is mainly affected by ports fairways and berth levels it is also closely related to the development of global fleets with ship type ship tonnage ship size ship age ship nationality navigational risk level etc in particular the model of waterborne traffic complexity metric has been established using ais data in order to quantify waterborne traffic complexity for navigable capacity management wen et al 2015 furthermore some software could be applied to calculate the navigable capacity such as arena qi et al 2017 and witness qi et al 2017 high marine transportation dynamics ship spatiotemporal behaviors and complex real time marine environments mean that calibrating navigable capacity estimation models is very important for ships in restricted narrow waterways particularly busy waterways and ports wang et al 2017 the calibration process must incorporate ship traffic flow structural characteristics in busy waterways however past researchers rarely estimated navigable capacity based on ais data and investigated the complexity of the ship traffic flow structural characteristics and the consequent impact on port and waterway throughput the main limitations of the previous studies lay in the following three aspects the navigable capacity estimation requires to consider waterway complexity the traffic flow structural characteristics ship type ship tonnage ship size ship age ship nationality navigational risk level etc and the spatial temporal resource consumption of ship traffic using real operational data the existing models could provide a reference for analyzing ship traffic behaviors and navigable capacity of waterways fairways but the results lack criteria to reflect the traffic situations in busy waterways the existing models ignore the number of clearings of the waterway and the difference of the spatial temporal resource consumption of various ships which are difficult to be applied in practice to bridge the research gap there is an urgent need for novel navigable capacity estimation approaches considering the traffic flow structural characteristics and the spatial temporal consumption based on real operational data accordingly in this study we propose a novel data driven approach to estimate the navigable capacity of busy waterways focusing on ships entering and leaving port firstly the real operational traffic data is collected and preprocessed afterwards the proposed approach draws insights from the complexity of traffic flow structural characteristics and the spatial temporal consumption of waterway resources based on the statistical and clustering analysis of traffic flow structural characteristics in busy waterways using the k means clustering algorithm considering the spatial temporal resource consumption of various ships therefore our approach is systematic proactive and transferable contributing to improving the reliability of calculating the navigable capacity of busy waterways establishing a theoretical basis for the design of port waterways and the determination of traffic organization schemes the rest of this paper proceeds as follows section 2 introduces the methodology of handling ais traffic data section 3 proposes the modeling of the navigable capacity of busy waterways section 4 describes a case study of the dagusha channel section 5 presents and discusses the empirical results of the case study section 6 concludes this paper with policy implications and suggestions for future research 2 traffic analysis for navigable capacity estimation of busy waterways 2 1 real operational traffic data the international maritime organization imo introduced the international convention for the safety of life at sea solas in 2002 this convention stipulates that most of the seagoing vessels that exceed 300 gt and all passenger vessels should be equipped with an ais zhang et al 2020 mou et al 2010 weng et al 2020 goerlandt et al 2017 an ais terminal is responsible for transmitting marine traffic data in both static and dynamic forms the static data include the length width type and marine mobile service identity mmsi number of the ship the dynamic data comprises the timestamp position longitude and latitude speed course and heading of the vessels thus gathering ais data transmitted from individual vessels can provide essential waterborne traffic information see table 1 for the ais data fields used by this study since the quality of ais data has been dramatically improved in recent years felski and jaskolskin 2013 there are growing research interest in ais data based studies such as collision avoidance route planning and ship behaviors analysis in particular zhou et al 2019 established a metric system to analyze ship traffic behaviors which paves the way for quantifying the navigable capacity of busy waterways based on the ship traffic flow along this line of thought the present paper proposes an ais data driven approach to estimating the navigable capacity of busy waterways building upon the structural characteristics of traffic flow however ais data must be cleaned due to the fact that ais data on a ship s position longitude and latitude speed and course are not very reliable when the data are collected and transmitted qu et al 2011 weng et al 2020 moreover the size of ais data as an information flow is enormous primarily because ais data are transmitted from vessels every 3 6 s at sea kujala et al 2009 note that when the ais data are extracted from the database every piece of data is sorted by time 2 2 data cleaning and processing it is self evident that the wrong information will lead to misleading results in any traffic analysis to clean and process ais data it is however not advisable to directly remove incorrect ais data information instead an ais data cleaning model should be employed to clean up and correct inaccurate or misleading information data or records the data cleaning method used here is introduced as follows identify wrong timestamp data from the ais database the ais data are transmitted by an ais transceiver and there are two types of ais transceivers a and b used on a particular ship in theory the ais data are transmitted at least every 10 s by type a subject to the environment and state of the ship therefore the timestamp for a ship i can be checked by eq 1 according to the function of the ais transceiver reasonable and reliable information should satisfy the following relation by eq 2 1 t j j 1 i t j 1 i t j i 2 3 s t j j 1 i 30 s here when t j j 1 i is less than 3 s the timestamp t j 1 i or t j i should be deleted when t j j 1 i is greater than 30 s a timestamp should be inserted between t j 1 i and t j i based on cubic spline interpolation see more in zhang et al 2015 identify irrational speed data from the ais database according to the navigation standards in busy waterways the average speed of a ship can be calculated as the distance between the position longitude x j and latitude y j at the timestamp t j and the position longitude x j 2 and latitude y j 2 at timestamp t j 2 and the sailing time of ship i as such we can check whether the speed data from the ais database are reasonable or not using the following 3 c sin x j t j sin x j 2 t j 2 cos y j t j cos y j 2 t j 2 cos d λ d r arccos c π 180 1852 v i t j j 2 i 3600 d t j 2 t j where v i t j j 2 i is the average speed of ship i at time interval t j t j 2 r is the radius of the earth the longitude x j and latitude y j at timestamp t j and the longitude x j 2 and latitude y j 2 at timestamp t j 2 denote the position of ship i and d λ denotes the difference between the position longitude x j and latitude y j at time t j and the position longitude x j 2 and latitude y j 2 at time t j 2 according to the statistics of the speed of a particular ship sailing in a busy waterway if the speed was between 3 and 20 knots then the ship was in port under normal conditions note that speed of more than 20 knots over ground is impossible to track in busy waterways further the speed data of a ship will not change dramatically in a short time therefore the ais speed data should satisfy the relevant condition as follows 4 3 s o g i t j 20 v i t j j 1 i s o g i t j 1 5 v i t j j 1 i s o g i t j 5 where s o g i t j is the speed over ground sog of ship i at time t j measured in knots and seconds and v i t j j 1 i is the average speed of ship i at time interval t j t j 1 furthermore we will update the incorrect speed data as follows 5 s o g i t j d e l e t e if the speed is less than 3 knots v i t j j 1 i if the speed is out of range s o g i t j others identify irrational position data from the ais database while the timestamp data and the speed data from the ais database are already corrected some irrational position data may still need to be cleaned specifically longitude x j and latitude y j should also satisfy eq 6 with the units of degrees as follows 6 d 1 3600 s o g i t j x s o g i t j 1 x 2 t j j 1 2 s o g i t j y s o g i t j 1 y 2 t j j 1 2 r arccos sin x j t j sin x j 2 t j 2 cos y j t j cos y j 2 t j 2 cos d λ π 180 1852 d δ d where d stands for the distance that ship i sails during time interval t j t j 1 d λ denotes the difference between the position longitude x j and latitude y j at time t j and the position longitude x j 2 and latitude y j 2 at time t j 2 δ d is the threshold value defined according to the speed and the length of ship i and the cleaning efficacy furthermore we will update the incorrect speed data as follows 7 x i t j 1 x i t j 1 x i t j 1 60 s o g i t j x s o g i t j 1 x 2 t j j 1 i 3600 if the longitude is within range if the longitude is out of range y i t j 1 y i t j 1 y i t j 1 60 s o g i t j y s o g i t j 1 y 2 t j j 1 i 3600 if the latitude is within range if the latitude is out of range additionally the static ais data such as ship length could be updated according to the mmsi number because some ais records lack ship length information the pseudo code of ais data processing is presented in the appendix the results of the cleaned data suggest that the data can be used to analyze ship traffic flow structural characteristics for navigable capacity estimation 2 3 traffic flow structural characteristics analysis the ship traffic flow structural characteristics refer to the proportion of ships in different types and scales cheng and liu 2005 which plays an essential role in the navigable capacity estimation of busy waterways focusing on entering and leaving port the characteristics of traffic flow in busy waterways contain significant differences in ship structures and complex traffic modes which have an essential influence on navigable capacity estimation ship types tonnages and scales affect the navigation mode of ships in and out of the port and in turn different navigation modes determine the capacity of the channel to a great extent in general the principles of ships entering and leaving port via busy waterways are expressed based on the traffic flow structural characteristics detailed described as follows special ships such as lng ships carriers lpg ships carriers have the priority to enter a harbor in real operational conditions the process of entering the harbor for special ships requires traffic organization including clearing the channel and controlling one way navigation in real operational conditions whether the ship width can meet the requirements of two way navigation of the channel can be determined according to the norms and navigation standards set by the port in real operational conditions since the busy waterway through capacity is influenced not only by the natural conditions waterway dimensions navigation rules etc but also by traffic situation which is not easy to define according to ship navigation rules focusing on a specific waterway a statistical analysis process for determining the traffic flow structural characteristics is shown in fig 1 in order to quantify the traffic flow structural characteristic in busy waterways a ship priority level is set in the ship traffic flow analysis process focusing on ships entering and leaving port the rules considered in the paper are expressed according to the handling operations and port management shown as follows a class ships have the highest priority while c class ships the lowest and b class ships are between a class and c class ships more specifically a class ships lng lpg ships and other ships carrying special or dangerous goods towing vessels etc namely c s a b class ships ordinary ships that can navigate in a two way waterway namely c s b c class ships ordinary ships that can only navigate in a one way waterway namely c s c accordingly the traffic situations can be estimated by characterizing the traffic flow structural characteristic using real operational traffic data which is reliable for navigable capacity estimation and the traffic flow structural characteristic in busy waterways can be expressed as 8 c s dimension c s a c s b c s c t the probability of one way navigation in busy waterways 9 p o n e w a y n a n c n where n a n b n c are the numbers of a b and c class ships in the busy waterway per unit of time n is the total number of ships to sum up focusing on a specific busy waterway the natural conditions waterway dimensions navigation rules etc are stable and traffic situation plays an essential role to affect the busy waterway through capacity in real operational conditions thus the real operational traffic flow structural characteristics need to be determined for navigable capacity estimation 2 4 identification method of traffic flow structural characteristics the aim of traffic flow clustering is to divide ships into different groups according to their associations or similarities of ship types ship travel behaviors and ship s dimensions making the similarities of ship behavior in the same group are as large as possible while these in different groups are as small as possible accordingly the ship traffic cluster analysis aims to categorize real operational traffic data on the basis of similarity to obtain the traffic flow structural characteristics of various clusters the k means clustering method is often used to cluster marine traffic data the principle of k means algorithm is to categorize different traffic flow structural characteristics of various ships according to different central points gradually through the iterative method updating the value of each central point and obtaining the best result for example with n data x 1 x 2 x 3 x n and k cluster centers x 1 x 2 x 3 x k the objective function is the sum of squared distances the smallest squared distance between every datum and its cluster center which is represented in eq 10 the pseudo code for traffic flow structural characteristics clustering method using the k means algorithm is presented in table 2 10 w n i 1 n min 1 j k x i a j 2 accordingly using the k means clustering method presented in table 2 we carried out a cluster analysis for ship types ship travel behaviors and ship s dimensions with the focus on the mentioned three types of ships a b and c hou et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 based on the real operational traffic data the ships are clustered into three clusters namely a class b class and c class for each cluster ships with a relatively small difference in ship width length and speed can be regarded as the same kind and are labeled a traffic flow cluster which are important key influencing factors on waterway through capacity wang et al 2017 thus ship length width and speed of the central point and frequency of each cluster of ships are obtained based on the k means the scale data of all kinds of ships in busy waterways can be expressed as 11 c s dimension c s l c s w c s v t the distributions of ship length c s l ship width c s w and ship velocity c s v are clustered to obtain the distribution characteristics of ship scale ship length ship width ship velocity the traffic flow structural characteristics model of the busy waterways for a class ships eq 12 14 b class ships eq 15 17 c class ships eq 18 20 can be expressed as follows 12 c c l u s t e r a v a f a 13 v a l a 1 w a 1 d a 1 l a 2 w a 2 d a 1 l a k w a k d a k 14 f a f a 1 f a 2 f a k 15 c c l u s t e r b v b f b 16 v b l b 1 w b 1 d b 1 l b 2 w b 2 d b 1 l b k w b k d b k 17 f b f b 1 f b 2 f b k 18 c c l u s t e r c v c f c 19 v c l c 1 w c 1 d c 1 l c 2 w c 2 d c 1 l c k w c k d c k 20 f c f c 1 f c 2 f c k where c cluster a is the clustering result of a class ships and f a is the probability distribution of each traffic flow cluster of a class ships the clustering results of b class ships and c class ships are analogous to the above in this section we classify the ships into three types based on the port management rules of ships entering and leaving port navigation rules of ships going through the waterway to define the priority further using the k means clustering method the analysis for ship travel behaviors and ship s dimensions of the ships associated with the same priority are illustrated which will provide a deep insight into the ship traffic for the data driven navigable capacity model 3 navigable capacity estimation of busy waterways 3 1 navigation rules and assumptions fig 2 illustrates the interaction of ships in busy waterways during the period of entering and leaving port based on the port management and navigation rules for a class ships and c class ships the opposite lane ship should be cleared to avoid encountering with other ships since the waterways are not wide enough to a class ships and c class ships for all ships in busy waterways ships require a safe distance for one way navigation when the ships are about to enter the busy waterway the opposite lane traffic should be cleared then other ships can enter the busy waterway following a class ships and c class ships when the ships have left the waterways the waterway becomes two way navigation for two way navigation the waterway is suitable for ships and the ships in opposite directions can navigate in the waterways without bothering each other prior to formulating the navigable capacity estimation model several assumptions should be made based on the navigation rules in busy waterways since the aim of this study is to determine the navigable capacity of busy waterways the specific assumptions are given as follows we assume an idealized ship traffic flow simplifying the one way and two way navigation decision processes more specifically if a ship s scale is lower than the one way navigation standard of the waterway then the ship is suitable for the two way navigation given the research objectives of this paper we simplify the behavioral characteristics of the ships considered and omit the influence of entering and leaving the port of ships on the navigable ability of the main channel in the case study that will be discussed later we consider a representative segment of the main channel of tianjin port 12 200 36 000 segments as the target water area of this study a safety domain around ships exists where any other ships are prohibited from invading ensuring that ships are not affected 3 2 ship safety distance estimation the ship safety domain plays a significant role in the fields of navigable capacity estimation zhang et al 2017 see more in fig 2 and the ship domain can be estimated using real operational traffic data such as ais data in the paper the historical ais data is therefore utilized for ship horizontal safety distance analysis in a busy waterway the nearest boundary determination method is adopted and the shape of the ship domain is calculated by the least squares method the shape of the ship domain in a busy waterway is recognized as an ellipse which is highly correlated with the ship s speed and ship s dimensions the novel method to ship safety domain estimation using ais data is proposed by hansen et al 2013 which was also involved in xin et al 2019 in the paper the mentioned method hansen et al 2013 xin et al 2019 is applied to estimate the ship safety domain in dagusha channel using ais data 3 3 analysis of time resource of busy waterways we can use the sufficient operation time of a waterway as its time resource in the actual operation of the waterway natural conditions ship movement and other constraints will cause reductions and vacancies of waterway time resources in order to guarantee the navigation safety of ships in the waterway wan et al 2019 the port management department and the maritime administration department can generally control the traffic from the aspects of visibility wind current and wave when two way navigation is converted to one way navigation the waterway must be emptied the time consumption of a single waterway clearance can be calculated by formula 21 21 t c l e a n l c h l a v e v a v e where l a v e is the average ship length v a v e is the average ship velocity in the waterway and l c h is the channel length furthermore let us denote the time consumption of a single two way conversion of the empty channel in unit time as k t c l e a n the available time resources on the channel are given as follows 22 t a v a i l a b l e m 1 t k t c l e a n where m 1 is the reduction factor of operating time per unit day set to be 0 85 k is the number of one way navigation within a unit day and t denotes the operation length per unit day notes m 1 and k are determined based on the real operational traffic maybe influenced by the tide and weather conditions according to the real traffic data about 20 4 h per unit day can be used to carry out entering and leaving port operations 3 4 analysis of space resource in busy waterways in busy waterways ships are prohibited from overtaking the waterways and a safe distance must be kept to ships in the front and back see more in section 3 2 therefore more attention should be paid on the effect of the ship s bow to stern spacing on the channel weng et al 2020 according to the navigation characteristics of ships in busy waterways the space occupied by the navigable channel can be regarded as a rectangle considering the differences between ship types the long axis of the shipping field is weighted by a weight value η the range of the weight value is set to be 0 7 1 5 according to the navigation condition of each port the weighted ship length corresponding to the three types of ships is 23 l a n 1 n k a l a n f a n 24 n 1 k f a n 1 where the weighted ship length of a class ships is l a l a n denotes the cluster n of a class ships delivering traffic cluster model based on k means and the probability of the l a n is defined as f a n likewise the weighted ship length of b class ships and c class ships l b and l c can be analogously calculated different weights are set for the three classified types of ships namely η a η b η c the ship field long axis for the above three types corresponds to that of ships i e the safety distances between ships namely h a h b h c λ denotes the coefficient of ship safety domain taking a class ships as an example the safety distance is calculated as follows 25 h a λ l a η a 3 5 spatial temporal resource consumption model in busy waterways given the navigation mode of the three types of ships one way navigation should be enacted for a certain period of time in the navigation channels for large ships and special ships a classes and c classes and the ratio u of the width of channel and ship navigation should be 1 note that u takes the value of two when the channel is in two way navigation the navigation ratios u of the three types of ships in the channel are p a p b p c respectively according to code of the general design of harbor of tianjin port the width of the ship tracks belt d is calculated as follows 26 d n l a sin γ b a in addition the ship speed distribution is also different for different ship types denoted by ν a ν b ν c respectively based on the ais dynamic data we can analyze the ship speed distribution statistically considering the navigable mode of ships the time and space resources needed for the above three types of ships on a single voyage are expressed in eq 25 taking a class as an example 27 c a h a d a l c h v a n l a sin γ b a λ l a η a l c h v a where c a is the channel resources for a class ships once again the estimation for b classes and c classes ships c b and c c are similar to the above 3 6 navigable capacity estimation model an individual ship in the traffic flow occupies a certain amount of time and space resources of the facility within a unit time zhang et al 2017 qu et al 2011 chen et al 2019b weng et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 liu et al 2019 port waterway capacity is the ratio of the spatiotemporal resources of the port waterway to the spatiotemporal resources occupied by a single ship generally sailing in and out of the port waterway which focuses on the traffic flow structure characteristics see more in section 2 3 as discussed in the previous sub sections the time and space resources of traffic flow in busy waterways are determined to establish the model of spatiotemporal resource consumption and the traffic flow structure characteristics are extracted from ais data the available spatiotemporal resources of busy waterways in unit time are 28 c c h l c h b c h t a v a i l a b l e accordingly the estimation model of the navigable capacity of busy waterways based on the traffic flow structure characteristics is given as follows 29 c r d c c h c i l c h b c h t a v a i l a b l e p a c a p b c b p c c c 30 c r d c c h c i l c h m 1 t k t c l e a n p a λ l a η a v a p b 0 5 λ l b η b v b p c λ l c η c v c where c r d is the channel throughput capacity per unit time 4 case study 4 1 data analysis 4 1 1 dagusha channel the dagusha channel is an important entry and exit channel of nanjiang zone the port of tianjin and the dagu port area at present it is a 100 000 ton waterway and a typical busy waterway in china see the map of the channel in fig 3 inbound and outbound ships mainly include lng ships bulk carriers and grocery ships etc in this study we applied the proposed traffic flow structural characteristics tfsc based estimation method to the productive marine traffic data of the dagusha channel using ais data the existing navigation standards for the dagusha channel are reported in table 3 4 1 2 traffic data in this study we extracted 4 5 million ais ship records managed by the tianjin navigation safety administration between 117 75 e 38 85 n and 118 e 38 95 n during march 2017 see fig 4 for an illustration the traffic data is cleaned based on the proposed method presented in section 2 2 and the ais data error rate is defined as the ratio of the incorrect ais data in the area to all data in the research area and the formula is shown in eq 31 31 μ i l i n i where l i is the number of the detected incorrect data n i denotes the number of all ais data in the whole area μ i is the data error rate in the dagusha channel 4 1 3 ship safety domain in dagusha channel using the ship domain model proposed by hansen et al 2013 and applied by xin et al 2019 the ship safety domains are demonstrated focusing on various ships in the dagusha channel using ais data fig 5 presents the elliptical ship domain models covering an area with a length of 24 l fig 5 also presents the density of smaller ships is higher than that of larger ships in the dagusha channel which is in line with the real operational conditions that ships are prohibited when the larger ships sail in the waterway according to the navigation rules there are fewer others in the waterway around the larger ships it also can be seen that the high density areas are located in front of the ship domain or behind the ship domain indicating that the waterway is a typic narrow waterway where there is no overtaking in the waterway it can be seen that the ellipse has a major axis of 7 64 l and a minor axis of 2 43 l for the ships with the length of less than 100 m for ships with the length of between 100 m and 200 m the ellipse has a major axis of 7 82 l and a minor axis of 3 05 l see more in table 4 in addition the major axis of the ships with a length of more than 300 m is shorter than that of the ships with a length of between 200 m and 300 m this may be due to the fact that the very large ships enter or level port under the tug assistance this finding indicates that a safety domain around ships exists where any other ships are prohibited which can provide essential parameters to estimate navigable capacity in busy waterways 4 2 busy waterway condition analysis according to the characteristics of the dagusha channel the influence of the inflow and outflow of ships on the navigation capacity of the channel are considered in view of the actual situation natural environment and navigation environment of the waterway the portal section of the waterway is selected as an example the relevant parameters are set in table 5 the weather conditions and the tide are key influencing factors on the navigable capacity of busy waterways in the paper the operating days of the waterway and reduction coefficient are determined based on the real operational traffic with the consideration that they may be influenced by the tide and weather conditions 4 3 cluster analysis of traffic flow structure characteristics in busy waterways 4 3 1 statistical analysis of ship traffic flow we cleaned and processed the ais data to deliver the ship traffic flow in the mentioned busy waterways using the method discussed in section 2 2 the traffic flow data of the dagusha channel were further analyzed statistically according to the traffic flow structure characteristics analysis procedure using the real operational traffic data introduced in section 2 3 as can be seen from table 6 delivered from real operational traffic data the ratio of a class ships p a is 0 11 showing that those special ships that can only navigate in one way in the dagusha channel i e lng ships take a quite small portion of the whole vessels in sharp contrast b class ships which can navigate in two way traffic in the dagusha channel account for the vast majority with p b 95 64 in addition c class ships are large ships that require one way navigation in the channel and p c 4 25 4 3 2 cluster analysis of ship traffic flow after the statistical analysis the traffic flow data were divided into three parts i e a class ships b class ships and c class ships for each part we use the k means clustering method to cluster the traffic flow data note that since a class ships i e lng ships must navigate in one way traffic in the port area and there are merely around 20 ships per year with non uniform ship scales it is impossible to conduct clustering analysis in this case the results of b class ships and c class ships are clustered and presented in fig 6 and table 7 and fig 7 and table 8 respectively 4 4 analysis of traffic capacity estimation results according to the statistical and clustering analysis results delivered from real operational traffic data representative ship types are selected and the corresponding ship speeds are shown in table 9 and after the traffic flow structure characteristics were determined and analyzed focusing on the mentioned busy waterways the parameters for traffic capacity calculation are displayed in table 10 in order to estimate the navigable capacity the above parameters in table 10 are used to calculate the navigable capacity of the tianjin dagusha channel based on eq 29 and eq 30 32 c r d 8 5 1 14 k 31 meanwhile the times of clearing channel has a significant influence on the throughput of busy waterways in order to assess the influence of the times of clearing channel the navigable capacity is calculated in various operational conditions as shown in fig 8 according to the customary practice of ports the maximum number k of one way navigation per day is 4 based on the characteristic of the busy waterway the above parameters are taken into account in the capacity calculation model to obtain the traffic capacity of busy waterways the maximum daily traffic capacity of the dagusha channel crd is about 109 ship times day and the maximum annual traffic capacity of the mentioned busy waterway is about 37060 ship times year 340 operating days of the waterway furthermore according to the predicted marine traffic density in dagusha channel in 2030 see more in table a2 the need of navigable capacity is estimated using the predicted marine traffic density in dagusha channel based on the proposed method according to the research data of the tianjin port the port department predicted that the channel would via about 96 ships per day in 2030 suggesting that the results of the model can meet the needs of recent and long term development 5 comparison and discussion 5 1 comparison of waterway capacity estimation regarding navigable capacity estimation the research contains ship maneuvering ship trials and simulation in this section some previous methods will be used to estimate the navigable capacity of the dagusha channel of tianjin port such as fujin model fujii y and tanaka k 1971 calculation method based on features of different ship types liu et al 2006 based on dynamic ship domain model liu et al 2016 the estimation results for the above three methods for the dagusha channel are shown in table 11 saturation status is a key parameter to assess the navigable capacity models by comparing the estimation results to the real traffic flow estimation results the real traffic flow see more in liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 table 11 shows that the estimation results the maximum navigable capacity of the proposed method are smaller than that of other methods that may be due to the proposed method applying larger safety domains and considering more influencing factors such as operating days of the waterway the reduction factor and channel clearance delivered form real operational conditions in addition the saturation status is larger than that of other methods which is in good agreement with the results of dagusha channel in 2030 when the predicted marine traffic exceeds the maximum navigable capacity there are needs to improve the navigation through capacity by broadening the waterway the case study indicates that the proposed model is more accurate than the previous method focusing on entering and leaving port 5 2 discussion on uncertainties and sensitivities since the busy waterway through capacity is influenced not only by the natural weather conditions waterway dimensions navigation rules port management etc but also by traffic situation in the paper the reduction factor the operation length per unit day the number of one two way navigation within a unit day delivered from real operational traffic data are considered to react the influence of the natural weather conditions waterway dimensions navigation rules port management etc if the traffic flow structural characteristics ship type ship tonnage ship size ship age ship nationality navigational risk level etc and the spatial temporal resource consumption of ship traffic using real operational data are considered these may be important to consider for further enhancing the understanding of waterway through capacity estimations thus the navigable capacity of busy waterways is estimated to present a reference for waterway design and traffic management with traffic flow structure characteristics explicitly taken into account a case study was carried out using the proposed approach for the dagusha channel of tianjin port showing good agreement between the navigable capacity design and traffic situations prior to concluding the paper we look into the uncertainties and sensitivities of the results since inaccuracies in data assumptions in models approaches or modeling procedures may affect the results various uncertainty assessment methods have been proposed goerlandt et al 2017 flage and aven 2009 zhang et al 2019 in this study the method suggested by flage and aven 2009 was applied various critical inputs of the analysis are listed in table 12 and their associated uncertainties and the results are assessed accordingly a brief justification of the rating is presented associated with the qualitative results for evaluating the uncertainty and sensitivity in table 12 the assessment could act as a guide for further research and methodological refinement the uncertainty assessment for possible grounding avoidance behaviors analysis is shown in table 13 in brief table 12 shows the uncertainty and sensitivity ratings of the various parameters of this study which suggests that there is generally low uncertainty related to the data sources and data processing procedures sensitivities are also expected to be rather low the uncertainties regarding the influence of estimation of the navigable capacity are moderate see table 13 nevertheless we state that the results of our analysis may change in various areas or various busy waterways this is addressed further in section 6 where directions for future work are discussed 6 conclusions and future work the paper proposes an ais data driven approach to estimate the navigable capacity of busy waterways focusing on ships entering and leaving port the approach is systematic proactive and transferable contributing to improving the reliability of calculating the navigable capacity of busy waterways the innovative use of the k means method for traffic flow structural characteristics clustering using ais data analytics may be recognized the ship safety domain model meets the demands expressed in current research and the obtained results are very promising and useful for navigable capacity estimations since the busy waterway through capacity is influenced not only by the natural weather conditions waterway dimensions navigation rules port management etc but also by traffic situation in the paper the reduction factor the operation length per unit day the number of one two way navigation within a unit day delivered from real operational traffic data are considered to react the influence of the natural weather conditions waterway dimensions navigation rules port management etc considering the above parameters in light of the difference in navigation modes in busy waterways the consumption of waterway resources and the vacancy and consumption of spatiotemporal resources are different for different types of ships in order to estimate the navigable capacity of busy waterways the present paper proposes an ais data driven approach to estimate the navigable capacity of busy waterways based on the traffic flow structural characteristics an empirical case study of the dagusha channel of tianjin port was carried out using the proposed method indicating that the maximum daily traffic capacity of the dagusha channel is about 109 ship times day and the maximum annual traffic capacity of the mentioned busy waterway is about 37060 ship times year 340 operating days of the waterway a comparison of waterway capacity estimation is carried out showing good agreement between the navigable capacity design and traffic situations using the proposed method the proposed approach is capable of calculating waterways capacity under complicated traffic flow structural characteristics and of quantifying the influence of dispatching on channel capacity providing support for the channel design and traffic organization scheme determination the detailed conclusions are presented as follows 1 the term of ship traffic flow structural characteristics was applied to analyze the traffic flow characteristics in busy waterways accompanied by ship traffic flow structural characteristics extraction model 2 the consumption of channel resources by different types of ships in various navigation modes was analyzed and an estimation model of navigable capacity in busy waterways was established based on traffic flow structural characteristic 3 the navigable capacity of busy waterways was quantified which can provide a theoretical basis for the port dispatching department to control port time ship safety distance and ship speed the results are effective within certain predefined boundary conditions but the modular nature of the navigable capacity estimation model allows its continuous improvement and adaptation to various conditions such as the reduction factor the operation length per unit day the number of one two way navigation within a unit day delivered from real operational traffic data should be updated to meet the real operational conditions despite the simplifications and the assumptions considered in the paper the results obtained are promising showing good agreement with the real traffic flow in the dagusha channel considering the recent growth of analytics and evidence based decision making we anticipate that the proposed approach provides support for the design of channel and determination of scheduling schemes for ships in busy waterways furthermore navigable capacity estimation of busy waterways derived from historical ais data has the potential to become one of the key enablers for future autonomous ships traffic operations in port areas credit authorship contribution statement cong liu

21334,this paper proposes a novel data driven approach to estimate the navigable capacity of busy waterways focusing on ships entering and leaving port based on the structural characteristics of traffic flow driven by the automatic identification system ais data first we collect the ship traffic flow in a busy waterway by processing the original ais data and then identify the structural characteristics of the traffic flow using the k means clustering algorithm the clusters are constructed based on the spatiotemporal consumption of waterway resources of different ships and the waste of waterway resources caused by navigational mode conversion taking ship domain into consideration we apply the proposed approach to estimate the navigable capacity of the dagusha channel of tianjin port china the empirical results reveal that the maximum daily traffic capacity of the dagusha channel is about 109 ship times day a comparison of waterway capacity estimation methods demonstrates that our proposed approach is more accurate and able to quantify the waterway capacity of different types of ships in a busy waterway taking the structural characteristics of traffic flow explicitly into account the proposed approach provides support for the design of channel and determination of scheduling schemes for ships in busy waterways keywords automatic identification system navigable capacity estimation traffic flow structural characteristics use of marine resources 1 introduction with a constant increase in marine traffic during recent years the development of traffic supervision and management of busy waterways have been hindered by water traffic congestion marine safety is a major priority of waterborne transportation wan et al 2018 in order to prevent marine traffic congestion in busy waterways from causing ship collision accidents navigable capacity estimation marine traffic analysis ship behavior analysis and traffic complexity analysis have drawn increasing attention such studies are motivated by marine safety management aiming at better understanding the mechanism of how ship collision accidents occur in busy waterways the critical value of navigable capacity in busy waterways that may lead to ship collision and the driving factors behind the navigable capacity of a busy waterway james et al 2018 countermeasures could then be identified to manage marine traffic in order to effectively enhance waterway transportation safety with more massive maritime transportation the moving situation of ship traffic is becoming more complicated and varied showing the characteristics of the complex structure crisscrossing higher density and wider range under this circumstance the spatial and temporal distribution of ship traffic is the embodiment feature for perceiving the characteristics of ship traffic automatic identification system ais data are an essential data source for theestimation of traffic behaviors and navigable capacity of busy waterways the application of ais data has developed from simply navigation oriented research to more complex directions that combining traffic flow estimation ship travel behaviors and vessel performance monitoring svanberg et al 2019 since 2004 all passenger ships and ships over 300 gross tonnage gt have been fitted with ais transponders see iala 2004 2016 and imo 2014 imo 2003 satellites have been systematically used since 2008 to collect improved quality data from ais transceivers installed on ships worldwide yang et al 2019 with the improvement in quality and accessibility of ais data over the last few years maritime research has been expanded toward understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of ship traffic e g arguedas et al 2018 wang et al 2017 pallotta et al 2014

especially considering the recent interest in autonomous shipping operations szlapczynski et al 2018 based on ais data analytics the navigable capacity of busy waterways and traffic behaviors could be constructively analyzed using advanced data mining techniques in order to effectively enhance waterway transportation safety academic research should focus on systematically evaluating how to manage marine traffic ais data may be useful to analyze traffic densities and traffic complexity sidibé and shu 2017 lensu et al 2019 in the literature navigable capacity estimation has been widely used in the field of transportation engineering the characteristics of ship traffic and the complex structures of ship traffic are increasingly highlighted in the supervision of busy waterways meng et al 2014 bye et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 haranen et al 2017 in particular the structural characteristics of ship traffic flow are closely related to the navigation efficiency and service level of busy waterways coldwell 1981 goerlandt et al 2011 xiao et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 chen et al 2020 in this context it is of great importance to study the structural characteristics extraction of ship traffic in busy waterways and explores the spatiotemporal resource consumption characteristics of busy waters for improving the navigable capacity of busy waterways ji et al 2009 wong et al 2009 wang et al 2017 to this end a majority of the existing literature focuses on analyzing the restriction of operational conditions in busy waterways and the influence of the behavioral characteristics of ship traffic on navigable capacity goerlandt and kujala 2011 hasegawa 2009 ince topuz 2004 watanabe et al 2008 yeo et al 2007 yip 2013 for instance liu et al 2016 examined the main factors of image transmission and traffic popularity and studied the application of ship traffic flow characteristics in traffic organization meng et al 2014 used the ais information to analyze the ship traffic flow and ship arrival law in the singapore strait they developed a prediction model of ship traffic flow to quantify the navigable capacity of the singapore strait in addition statistical approaches are used to calculate the complexity characteristics based on traffic flow structural characteristics taking speed length and ship types into consideration sang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 2019 2020 chen et al 2019a zhang et al 2016 while the composition of ship traffic flow structure characteristic is mainly affected by ports fairways and berth levels it is also closely related to the development of global fleets with ship type ship tonnage ship size ship age ship nationality navigational risk level etc in particular the model of waterborne traffic complexity metric has been established using ais data in order to quantify waterborne traffic complexity for navigable capacity management wen et al 2015 furthermore some software could be applied to calculate the navigable capacity such as arena qi et al 2017 and witness qi et al 2017 high marine transportation dynamics ship spatiotemporal behaviors and complex real time marine environments mean that calibrating navigable capacity estimation models is very important for ships in restricted narrow waterways particularly busy waterways and ports wang et al 2017 the calibration process must incorporate ship traffic flow structural characteristics in busy waterways however past researchers rarely estimated navigable capacity based on ais data and investigated the complexity of the ship traffic flow structural characteristics and the consequent impact on port and waterway throughput the main limitations of the previous studies lay in the following three aspects the navigable capacity estimation requires to consider waterway complexity the traffic flow structural characteristics ship type ship tonnage ship size ship age ship nationality navigational risk level etc and the spatial temporal resource consumption of ship traffic using real operational data the existing models could provide a reference for analyzing ship traffic behaviors and navigable capacity of waterways fairways but the results lack criteria to reflect the traffic situations in busy waterways the existing models ignore the number of clearings of the waterway and the difference of the spatial temporal resource consumption of various ships which are difficult to be applied in practice to bridge the research gap there is an urgent need for novel navigable capacity estimation approaches considering the traffic flow structural characteristics and the spatial temporal consumption based on real operational data accordingly in this study we propose a novel data driven approach to estimate the navigable capacity of busy waterways focusing on ships entering and leaving port firstly the real operational traffic data is collected and preprocessed afterwards the proposed approach draws insights from the complexity of traffic flow structural characteristics and the spatial temporal consumption of waterway resources based on the statistical and clustering analysis of traffic flow structural characteristics in busy waterways using the k means clustering algorithm considering the spatial temporal resource consumption of various ships therefore our approach is systematic proactive and transferable contributing to improving the reliability of calculating the navigable capacity of busy waterways establishing a theoretical basis for the design of port waterways and the determination of traffic organization schemes the rest of this paper proceeds as follows section 2 introduces the methodology of handling ais traffic data section 3 proposes the modeling of the navigable capacity of busy waterways section 4 describes a case study of the dagusha channel section 5 presents and discusses the empirical results of the case study section 6 concludes this paper with policy implications and suggestions for future research 2 traffic analysis for navigable capacity estimation of busy waterways 2 1 real operational traffic data the international maritime organization imo introduced the international convention for the safety of life at sea solas in 2002 this convention stipulates that most of the seagoing vessels that exceed 300 gt and all passenger vessels should be equipped with an ais zhang et al 2020 mou et al 2010 weng et al 2020 goerlandt et al 2017 an ais terminal is responsible for transmitting marine traffic data in both static and dynamic forms the static data include the length width type and marine mobile service identity mmsi number of the ship the dynamic data comprises the timestamp position longitude and latitude speed course and heading of the vessels thus gathering ais data transmitted from individual vessels can provide essential waterborne traffic information see table 1 for the ais data fields used by this study since the quality of ais data has been dramatically improved in recent years felski and jaskolskin 2013 there are growing research interest in ais data based studies such as collision avoidance route planning and ship behaviors analysis in particular zhou et al 2019 established a metric system to analyze ship traffic behaviors which paves the way for quantifying the navigable capacity of busy waterways based on the ship traffic flow along this line of thought the present paper proposes an ais data driven approach to estimating the navigable capacity of busy waterways building upon the structural characteristics of traffic flow however ais data must be cleaned due to the fact that ais data on a ship s position longitude and latitude speed and course are not very reliable when the data are collected and transmitted qu et al 2011 weng et al 2020 moreover the size of ais data as an information flow is enormous primarily because ais data are transmitted from vessels every 3 6 s at sea kujala et al 2009 note that when the ais data are extracted from the database every piece of data is sorted by time 2 2 data cleaning and processing it is self evident that the wrong information will lead to misleading results in any traffic analysis to clean and process ais data it is however not advisable to directly remove incorrect ais data information instead an ais data cleaning model should be employed to clean up and correct inaccurate or misleading information data or records the data cleaning method used here is introduced as follows identify wrong timestamp data from the ais database the ais data are transmitted by an ais transceiver and there are two types of ais transceivers a and b used on a particular ship in theory the ais data are transmitted at least every 10 s by type a subject to the environment and state of the ship therefore the timestamp for a ship i can be checked by eq 1 according to the function of the ais transceiver reasonable and reliable information should satisfy the following relation by eq 2 1 t j j 1 i t j 1 i t j i 2 3 s t j j 1 i 30 s here when t j j 1 i is less than 3 s the timestamp t j 1 i or t j i should be deleted when t j j 1 i is greater than 30 s a timestamp should be inserted between t j 1 i and t j i based on cubic spline interpolation see more in zhang et al 2015 identify irrational speed data from the ais database according to the navigation standards in busy waterways the average speed of a ship can be calculated as the distance between the position longitude x j and latitude y j at the timestamp t j and the position longitude x j 2 and latitude y j 2 at timestamp t j 2 and the sailing time of ship i as such we can check whether the speed data from the ais database are reasonable or not using the following 3 c sin x j t j sin x j 2 t j 2 cos y j t j cos y j 2 t j 2 cos d λ d r arccos c π 180 1852 v i t j j 2 i 3600 d t j 2 t j where v i t j j 2 i is the average speed of ship i at time interval t j t j 2 r is the radius of the earth the longitude x j and latitude y j at timestamp t j and the longitude x j 2 and latitude y j 2 at timestamp t j 2 denote the position of ship i and d λ denotes the difference between the position longitude x j and latitude y j at time t j and the position longitude x j 2 and latitude y j 2 at time t j 2 according to the statistics of the speed of a particular ship sailing in a busy waterway if the speed was between 3 and 20 knots then the ship was in port under normal conditions note that speed of more than 20 knots over ground is impossible to track in busy waterways further the speed data of a ship will not change dramatically in a short time therefore the ais speed data should satisfy the relevant condition as follows 4 3 s o g i t j 20 v i t j j 1 i s o g i t j 1 5 v i t j j 1 i s o g i t j 5 where s o g i t j is the speed over ground sog of ship i at time t j measured in knots and seconds and v i t j j 1 i is the average speed of ship i at time interval t j t j 1 furthermore we will update the incorrect speed data as follows 5 s o g i t j d e l e t e if the speed is less than 3 knots v i t j j 1 i if the speed is out of range s o g i t j others identify irrational position data from the ais database while the timestamp data and the speed data from the ais database are already corrected some irrational position data may still need to be cleaned specifically longitude x j and latitude y j should also satisfy eq 6 with the units of degrees as follows 6 d 1 3600 s o g i t j x s o g i t j 1 x 2 t j j 1 2 s o g i t j y s o g i t j 1 y 2 t j j 1 2 r arccos sin x j t j sin x j 2 t j 2 cos y j t j cos y j 2 t j 2 cos d λ π 180 1852 d δ d where d stands for the distance that ship i sails during time interval t j t j 1 d λ denotes the difference between the position longitude x j and latitude y j at time t j and the position longitude x j 2 and latitude y j 2 at time t j 2 δ d is the threshold value defined according to the speed and the length of ship i and the cleaning efficacy furthermore we will update the incorrect speed data as follows 7 x i t j 1 x i t j 1 x i t j 1 60 s o g i t j x s o g i t j 1 x 2 t j j 1 i 3600 if the longitude is within range if the longitude is out of range y i t j 1 y i t j 1 y i t j 1 60 s o g i t j y s o g i t j 1 y 2 t j j 1 i 3600 if the latitude is within range if the latitude is out of range additionally the static ais data such as ship length could be updated according to the mmsi number because some ais records lack ship length information the pseudo code of ais data processing is presented in the appendix the results of the cleaned data suggest that the data can be used to analyze ship traffic flow structural characteristics for navigable capacity estimation 2 3 traffic flow structural characteristics analysis the ship traffic flow structural characteristics refer to the proportion of ships in different types and scales cheng and liu 2005 which plays an essential role in the navigable capacity estimation of busy waterways focusing on entering and leaving port the characteristics of traffic flow in busy waterways contain significant differences in ship structures and complex traffic modes which have an essential influence on navigable capacity estimation ship types tonnages and scales affect the navigation mode of ships in and out of the port and in turn different navigation modes determine the capacity of the channel to a great extent in general the principles of ships entering and leaving port via busy waterways are expressed based on the traffic flow structural characteristics detailed described as follows special ships such as lng ships carriers lpg ships carriers have the priority to enter a harbor in real operational conditions the process of entering the harbor for special ships requires traffic organization including clearing the channel and controlling one way navigation in real operational conditions whether the ship width can meet the requirements of two way navigation of the channel can be determined according to the norms and navigation standards set by the port in real operational conditions since the busy waterway through capacity is influenced not only by the natural conditions waterway dimensions navigation rules etc but also by traffic situation which is not easy to define according to ship navigation rules focusing on a specific waterway a statistical analysis process for determining the traffic flow structural characteristics is shown in fig 1 in order to quantify the traffic flow structural characteristic in busy waterways a ship priority level is set in the ship traffic flow analysis process focusing on ships entering and leaving port the rules considered in the paper are expressed according to the handling operations and port management shown as follows a class ships have the highest priority while c class ships the lowest and b class ships are between a class and c class ships more specifically a class ships lng lpg ships and other ships carrying special or dangerous goods towing vessels etc namely c s a b class ships ordinary ships that can navigate in a two way waterway namely c s b c class ships ordinary ships that can only navigate in a one way waterway namely c s c accordingly the traffic situations can be estimated by characterizing the traffic flow structural characteristic using real operational traffic data which is reliable for navigable capacity estimation and the traffic flow structural characteristic in busy waterways can be expressed as 8 c s dimension c s a c s b c s c t the probability of one way navigation in busy waterways 9 p o n e w a y n a n c n where n a n b n c are the numbers of a b and c class ships in the busy waterway per unit of time n is the total number of ships to sum up focusing on a specific busy waterway the natural conditions waterway dimensions navigation rules etc are stable and traffic situation plays an essential role to affect the busy waterway through capacity in real operational conditions thus the real operational traffic flow structural characteristics need to be determined for navigable capacity estimation 2 4 identification method of traffic flow structural characteristics the aim of traffic flow clustering is to divide ships into different groups according to their associations or similarities of ship types ship travel behaviors and ship s dimensions making the similarities of ship behavior in the same group are as large as possible while these in different groups are as small as possible accordingly the ship traffic cluster analysis aims to categorize real operational traffic data on the basis of similarity to obtain the traffic flow structural characteristics of various clusters the k means clustering method is often used to cluster marine traffic data the principle of k means algorithm is to categorize different traffic flow structural characteristics of various ships according to different central points gradually through the iterative method updating the value of each central point and obtaining the best result for example with n data x 1 x 2 x 3 x n and k cluster centers x 1 x 2 x 3 x k the objective function is the sum of squared distances the smallest squared distance between every datum and its cluster center which is represented in eq 10 the pseudo code for traffic flow structural characteristics clustering method using the k means algorithm is presented in table 2 10 w n i 1 n min 1 j k x i a j 2 accordingly using the k means clustering method presented in table 2 we carried out a cluster analysis for ship types ship travel behaviors and ship s dimensions with the focus on the mentioned three types of ships a b and c hou et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 based on the real operational traffic data the ships are clustered into three clusters namely a class b class and c class for each cluster ships with a relatively small difference in ship width length and speed can be regarded as the same kind and are labeled a traffic flow cluster which are important key influencing factors on waterway through capacity wang et al 2017 thus ship length width and speed of the central point and frequency of each cluster of ships are obtained based on the k means the scale data of all kinds of ships in busy waterways can be expressed as 11 c s dimension c s l c s w c s v t the distributions of ship length c s l ship width c s w and ship velocity c s v are clustered to obtain the distribution characteristics of ship scale ship length ship width ship velocity the traffic flow structural characteristics model of the busy waterways for a class ships eq 12 14 b class ships eq 15 17 c class ships eq 18 20 can be expressed as follows 12 c c l u s t e r a v a f a 13 v a l a 1 w a 1 d a 1 l a 2 w a 2 d a 1 l a k w a k d a k 14 f a f a 1 f a 2 f a k 15 c c l u s t e r b v b f b 16 v b l b 1 w b 1 d b 1 l b 2 w b 2 d b 1 l b k w b k d b k 17 f b f b 1 f b 2 f b k 18 c c l u s t e r c v c f c 19 v c l c 1 w c 1 d c 1 l c 2 w c 2 d c 1 l c k w c k d c k 20 f c f c 1 f c 2 f c k where c cluster a is the clustering result of a class ships and f a is the probability distribution of each traffic flow cluster of a class ships the clustering results of b class ships and c class ships are analogous to the above in this section we classify the ships into three types based on the port management rules of ships entering and leaving port navigation rules of ships going through the waterway to define the priority further using the k means clustering method the analysis for ship travel behaviors and ship s dimensions of the ships associated with the same priority are illustrated which will provide a deep insight into the ship traffic for the data driven navigable capacity model 3 navigable capacity estimation of busy waterways 3 1 navigation rules and assumptions fig 2 illustrates the interaction of ships in busy waterways during the period of entering and leaving port based on the port management and navigation rules for a class ships and c class ships the opposite lane ship should be cleared to avoid encountering with other ships since the waterways are not wide enough to a class ships and c class ships for all ships in busy waterways ships require a safe distance for one way navigation when the ships are about to enter the busy waterway the opposite lane traffic should be cleared then other ships can enter the busy waterway following a class ships and c class ships when the ships have left the waterways the waterway becomes two way navigation for two way navigation the waterway is suitable for ships and the ships in opposite directions can navigate in the waterways without bothering each other prior to formulating the navigable capacity estimation model several assumptions should be made based on the navigation rules in busy waterways since the aim of this study is to determine the navigable capacity of busy waterways the specific assumptions are given as follows we assume an idealized ship traffic flow simplifying the one way and two way navigation decision processes more specifically if a ship s scale is lower than the one way navigation standard of the waterway then the ship is suitable for the two way navigation given the research objectives of this paper we simplify the behavioral characteristics of the ships considered and omit the influence of entering and leaving the port of ships on the navigable ability of the main channel in the case study that will be discussed later we consider a representative segment of the main channel of tianjin port 12 200 36 000 segments as the target water area of this study a safety domain around ships exists where any other ships are prohibited from invading ensuring that ships are not affected 3 2 ship safety distance estimation the ship safety domain plays a significant role in the fields of navigable capacity estimation zhang et al 2017 see more in fig 2 and the ship domain can be estimated using real operational traffic data such as ais data in the paper the historical ais data is therefore utilized for ship horizontal safety distance analysis in a busy waterway the nearest boundary determination method is adopted and the shape of the ship domain is calculated by the least squares method the shape of the ship domain in a busy waterway is recognized as an ellipse which is highly correlated with the ship s speed and ship s dimensions the novel method to ship safety domain estimation using ais data is proposed by hansen et al 2013 which was also involved in xin et al 2019 in the paper the mentioned method hansen et al 2013 xin et al 2019 is applied to estimate the ship safety domain in dagusha channel using ais data 3 3 analysis of time resource of busy waterways we can use the sufficient operation time of a waterway as its time resource in the actual operation of the waterway natural conditions ship movement and other constraints will cause reductions and vacancies of waterway time resources in order to guarantee the navigation safety of ships in the waterway wan et al 2019 the port management department and the maritime administration department can generally control the traffic from the aspects of visibility wind current and wave when two way navigation is converted to one way navigation the waterway must be emptied the time consumption of a single waterway clearance can be calculated by formula 21 21 t c l e a n l c h l a v e v a v e where l a v e is the average ship length v a v e is the average ship velocity in the waterway and l c h is the channel length furthermore let us denote the time consumption of a single two way conversion of the empty channel in unit time as k t c l e a n the available time resources on the channel are given as follows 22 t a v a i l a b l e m 1 t k t c l e a n where m 1 is the reduction factor of operating time per unit day set to be 0 85 k is the number of one way navigation within a unit day and t denotes the operation length per unit day notes m 1 and k are determined based on the real operational traffic maybe influenced by the tide and weather conditions according to the real traffic data about 20 4 h per unit day can be used to carry out entering and leaving port operations 3 4 analysis of space resource in busy waterways in busy waterways ships are prohibited from overtaking the waterways and a safe distance must be kept to ships in the front and back see more in section 3 2 therefore more attention should be paid on the effect of the ship s bow to stern spacing on the channel weng et al 2020 according to the navigation characteristics of ships in busy waterways the space occupied by the navigable channel can be regarded as a rectangle considering the differences between ship types the long axis of the shipping field is weighted by a weight value η the range of the weight value is set to be 0 7 1 5 according to the navigation condition of each port the weighted ship length corresponding to the three types of ships is 23 l a n 1 n k a l a n f a n 24 n 1 k f a n 1 where the weighted ship length of a class ships is l a l a n denotes the cluster n of a class ships delivering traffic cluster model based on k means and the probability of the l a n is defined as f a n likewise the weighted ship length of b class ships and c class ships l b and l c can be analogously calculated different weights are set for the three classified types of ships namely η a η b η c the ship field long axis for the above three types corresponds to that of ships i e the safety distances between ships namely h a h b h c λ denotes the coefficient of ship safety domain taking a class ships as an example the safety distance is calculated as follows 25 h a λ l a η a 3 5 spatial temporal resource consumption model in busy waterways given the navigation mode of the three types of ships one way navigation should be enacted for a certain period of time in the navigation channels for large ships and special ships a classes and c classes and the ratio u of the width of channel and ship navigation should be 1 note that u takes the value of two when the channel is in two way navigation the navigation ratios u of the three types of ships in the channel are p a p b p c respectively according to code of the general design of harbor of tianjin port the width of the ship tracks belt d is calculated as follows 26 d n l a sin γ b a in addition the ship speed distribution is also different for different ship types denoted by ν a ν b ν c respectively based on the ais dynamic data we can analyze the ship speed distribution statistically considering the navigable mode of ships the time and space resources needed for the above three types of ships on a single voyage are expressed in eq 25 taking a class as an example 27 c a h a d a l c h v a n l a sin γ b a λ l a η a l c h v a where c a is the channel resources for a class ships once again the estimation for b classes and c classes ships c b and c c are similar to the above 3 6 navigable capacity estimation model an individual ship in the traffic flow occupies a certain amount of time and space resources of the facility within a unit time zhang et al 2017 qu et al 2011 chen et al 2019b weng et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 liu et al 2019 port waterway capacity is the ratio of the spatiotemporal resources of the port waterway to the spatiotemporal resources occupied by a single ship generally sailing in and out of the port waterway which focuses on the traffic flow structure characteristics see more in section 2 3 as discussed in the previous sub sections the time and space resources of traffic flow in busy waterways are determined to establish the model of spatiotemporal resource consumption and the traffic flow structure characteristics are extracted from ais data the available spatiotemporal resources of busy waterways in unit time are 28 c c h l c h b c h t a v a i l a b l e accordingly the estimation model of the navigable capacity of busy waterways based on the traffic flow structure characteristics is given as follows 29 c r d c c h c i l c h b c h t a v a i l a b l e p a c a p b c b p c c c 30 c r d c c h c i l c h m 1 t k t c l e a n p a λ l a η a v a p b 0 5 λ l b η b v b p c λ l c η c v c where c r d is the channel throughput capacity per unit time 4 case study 4 1 data analysis 4 1 1 dagusha channel the dagusha channel is an important entry and exit channel of nanjiang zone the port of tianjin and the dagu port area at present it is a 100 000 ton waterway and a typical busy waterway in china see the map of the channel in fig 3 inbound and outbound ships mainly include lng ships bulk carriers and grocery ships etc in this study we applied the proposed traffic flow structural characteristics tfsc based estimation method to the productive marine traffic data of the dagusha channel using ais data the existing navigation standards for the dagusha channel are reported in table 3 4 1 2 traffic data in this study we extracted 4 5 million ais ship records managed by the tianjin navigation safety administration between 117 75 e 38 85 n and 118 e 38 95 n during march 2017 see fig 4 for an illustration the traffic data is cleaned based on the proposed method presented in section 2 2 and the ais data error rate is defined as the ratio of the incorrect ais data in the area to all data in the research area and the formula is shown in eq 31 31 μ i l i n i where l i is the number of the detected incorrect data n i denotes the number of all ais data in the whole area μ i is the data error rate in the dagusha channel 4 1 3 ship safety domain in dagusha channel using the ship domain model proposed by hansen et al 2013 and applied by xin et al 2019 the ship safety domains are demonstrated focusing on various ships in the dagusha channel using ais data fig 5 presents the elliptical ship domain models covering an area with a length of 24 l fig 5 also presents the density of smaller ships is higher than that of larger ships in the dagusha channel which is in line with the real operational conditions that ships are prohibited when the larger ships sail in the waterway according to the navigation rules there are fewer others in the waterway around the larger ships it also can be seen that the high density areas are located in front of the ship domain or behind the ship domain indicating that the waterway is a typic narrow waterway where there is no overtaking in the waterway it can be seen that the ellipse has a major axis of 7 64 l and a minor axis of 2 43 l for the ships with the length of less than 100 m for ships with the length of between 100 m and 200 m the ellipse has a major axis of 7 82 l and a minor axis of 3 05 l see more in table 4 in addition the major axis of the ships with a length of more than 300 m is shorter than that of the ships with a length of between 200 m and 300 m this may be due to the fact that the very large ships enter or level port under the tug assistance this finding indicates that a safety domain around ships exists where any other ships are prohibited which can provide essential parameters to estimate navigable capacity in busy waterways 4 2 busy waterway condition analysis according to the characteristics of the dagusha channel the influence of the inflow and outflow of ships on the navigation capacity of the channel are considered in view of the actual situation natural environment and navigation environment of the waterway the portal section of the waterway is selected as an example the relevant parameters are set in table 5 the weather conditions and the tide are key influencing factors on the navigable capacity of busy waterways in the paper the operating days of the waterway and reduction coefficient are determined based on the real operational traffic with the consideration that they may be influenced by the tide and weather conditions 4 3 cluster analysis of traffic flow structure characteristics in busy waterways 4 3 1 statistical analysis of ship traffic flow we cleaned and processed the ais data to deliver the ship traffic flow in the mentioned busy waterways using the method discussed in section 2 2 the traffic flow data of the dagusha channel were further analyzed statistically according to the traffic flow structure characteristics analysis procedure using the real operational traffic data introduced in section 2 3 as can be seen from table 6 delivered from real operational traffic data the ratio of a class ships p a is 0 11 showing that those special ships that can only navigate in one way in the dagusha channel i e lng ships take a quite small portion of the whole vessels in sharp contrast b class ships which can navigate in two way traffic in the dagusha channel account for the vast majority with p b 95 64 in addition c class ships are large ships that require one way navigation in the channel and p c 4 25 4 3 2 cluster analysis of ship traffic flow after the statistical analysis the traffic flow data were divided into three parts i e a class ships b class ships and c class ships for each part we use the k means clustering method to cluster the traffic flow data note that since a class ships i e lng ships must navigate in one way traffic in the port area and there are merely around 20 ships per year with non uniform ship scales it is impossible to conduct clustering analysis in this case the results of b class ships and c class ships are clustered and presented in fig 6 and table 7 and fig 7 and table 8 respectively 4 4 analysis of traffic capacity estimation results according to the statistical and clustering analysis results delivered from real operational traffic data representative ship types are selected and the corresponding ship speeds are shown in table 9 and after the traffic flow structure characteristics were determined and analyzed focusing on the mentioned busy waterways the parameters for traffic capacity calculation are displayed in table 10 in order to estimate the navigable capacity the above parameters in table 10 are used to calculate the navigable capacity of the tianjin dagusha channel based on eq 29 and eq 30 32 c r d 8 5 1 14 k 31 meanwhile the times of clearing channel has a significant influence on the throughput of busy waterways in order to assess the influence of the times of clearing channel the navigable capacity is calculated in various operational conditions as shown in fig 8 according to the customary practice of ports the maximum number k of one way navigation per day is 4 based on the characteristic of the busy waterway the above parameters are taken into account in the capacity calculation model to obtain the traffic capacity of busy waterways the maximum daily traffic capacity of the dagusha channel crd is about 109 ship times day and the maximum annual traffic capacity of the mentioned busy waterway is about 37060 ship times year 340 operating days of the waterway furthermore according to the predicted marine traffic density in dagusha channel in 2030 see more in table a2 the need of navigable capacity is estimated using the predicted marine traffic density in dagusha channel based on the proposed method according to the research data of the tianjin port the port department predicted that the channel would via about 96 ships per day in 2030 suggesting that the results of the model can meet the needs of recent and long term development 5 comparison and discussion 5 1 comparison of waterway capacity estimation regarding navigable capacity estimation the research contains ship maneuvering ship trials and simulation in this section some previous methods will be used to estimate the navigable capacity of the dagusha channel of tianjin port such as fujin model fujii y and tanaka k 1971 calculation method based on features of different ship types liu et al 2006 based on dynamic ship domain model liu et al 2016 the estimation results for the above three methods for the dagusha channel are shown in table 11 saturation status is a key parameter to assess the navigable capacity models by comparing the estimation results to the real traffic flow estimation results the real traffic flow see more in liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 table 11 shows that the estimation results the maximum navigable capacity of the proposed method are smaller than that of other methods that may be due to the proposed method applying larger safety domains and considering more influencing factors such as operating days of the waterway the reduction factor and channel clearance delivered form real operational conditions in addition the saturation status is larger than that of other methods which is in good agreement with the results of dagusha channel in 2030 when the predicted marine traffic exceeds the maximum navigable capacity there are needs to improve the navigation through capacity by broadening the waterway the case study indicates that the proposed model is more accurate than the previous method focusing on entering and leaving port 5 2 discussion on uncertainties and sensitivities since the busy waterway through capacity is influenced not only by the natural weather conditions waterway dimensions navigation rules port management etc but also by traffic situation in the paper the reduction factor the operation length per unit day the number of one two way navigation within a unit day delivered from real operational traffic data are considered to react the influence of the natural weather conditions waterway dimensions navigation rules port management etc if the traffic flow structural characteristics ship type ship tonnage ship size ship age ship nationality navigational risk level etc and the spatial temporal resource consumption of ship traffic using real operational data are considered these may be important to consider for further enhancing the understanding of waterway through capacity estimations thus the navigable capacity of busy waterways is estimated to present a reference for waterway design and traffic management with traffic flow structure characteristics explicitly taken into account a case study was carried out using the proposed approach for the dagusha channel of tianjin port showing good agreement between the navigable capacity design and traffic situations prior to concluding the paper we look into the uncertainties and sensitivities of the results since inaccuracies in data assumptions in models approaches or modeling procedures may affect the results various uncertainty assessment methods have been proposed goerlandt et al 2017 flage and aven 2009 zhang et al 2019 in this study the method suggested by flage and aven 2009 was applied various critical inputs of the analysis are listed in table 12 and their associated uncertainties and the results are assessed accordingly a brief justification of the rating is presented associated with the qualitative results for evaluating the uncertainty and sensitivity in table 12 the assessment could act as a guide for further research and methodological refinement the uncertainty assessment for possible grounding avoidance behaviors analysis is shown in table 13 in brief table 12 shows the uncertainty and sensitivity ratings of the various parameters of this study which suggests that there is generally low uncertainty related to the data sources and data processing procedures sensitivities are also expected to be rather low the uncertainties regarding the influence of estimation of the navigable capacity are moderate see table 13 nevertheless we state that the results of our analysis may change in various areas or various busy waterways this is addressed further in section 6 where directions for future work are discussed 6 conclusions and future work the paper proposes an ais data driven approach to estimate the navigable capacity of busy waterways focusing on ships entering and leaving port the approach is systematic proactive and transferable contributing to improving the reliability of calculating the navigable capacity of busy waterways the innovative use of the k means method for traffic flow structural characteristics clustering using ais data analytics may be recognized the ship safety domain model meets the demands expressed in current research and the obtained results are very promising and useful for navigable capacity estimations since the busy waterway through capacity is influenced not only by the natural weather conditions waterway dimensions navigation rules port management etc but also by traffic situation in the paper the reduction factor the operation length per unit day the number of one two way navigation within a unit day delivered from real operational traffic data are considered to react the influence of the natural weather conditions waterway dimensions navigation rules port management etc considering the above parameters in light of the difference in navigation modes in busy waterways the consumption of waterway resources and the vacancy and consumption of spatiotemporal resources are different for different types of ships in order to estimate the navigable capacity of busy waterways the present paper proposes an ais data driven approach to estimate the navigable capacity of busy waterways based on the traffic flow structural characteristics an empirical case study of the dagusha channel of tianjin port was carried out using the proposed method indicating that the maximum daily traffic capacity of the dagusha channel is about 109 ship times day and the maximum annual traffic capacity of the mentioned busy waterway is about 37060 ship times year 340 operating days of the waterway a comparison of waterway capacity estimation is carried out showing good agreement between the navigable capacity design and traffic situations using the proposed method the proposed approach is capable of calculating waterways capacity under complicated traffic flow structural characteristics and of quantifying the influence of dispatching on channel capacity providing support for the channel design and traffic organization scheme determination the detailed conclusions are presented as follows 1 the term of ship traffic flow structural characteristics was applied to analyze the traffic flow characteristics in busy waterways accompanied by ship traffic flow structural characteristics extraction model 2 the consumption of channel resources by different types of ships in various navigation modes was analyzed and an estimation model of navigable capacity in busy waterways was established based on traffic flow structural characteristic 3 the navigable capacity of busy waterways was quantified which can provide a theoretical basis for the port dispatching department to control port time ship safety distance and ship speed the results are effective within certain predefined boundary conditions but the modular nature of the navigable capacity estimation model allows its continuous improvement and adaptation to various conditions such as the reduction factor the operation length per unit day the number of one two way navigation within a unit day delivered from real operational traffic data should be updated to meet the real operational conditions despite the simplifications and the assumptions considered in the paper the results obtained are promising showing good agreement with the real traffic flow in the dagusha channel considering the recent growth of analytics and evidence based decision making we anticipate that the proposed approach provides support for the design of channel and determination of scheduling schemes for ships in busy waterways furthermore navigable capacity estimation of busy waterways derived from historical ais data has the potential to become one of the key enablers for future autonomous ships traffic operations in port areas credit authorship contribution statement cong liu
