19145,soluble mn iii species stabilized by natural organic matter nom plays a crucial role in a number of biogeochemical processes to date current understanding of these phenomena has been primarily concerned on the occurrence and chemistry of soluble nom mn iii complexes much less is known regarding the formation and stability of nom mn iii colloids in the environment this presents a critical knowledge gap with regard to biogeochemical cycling of manganese and associated carbon and for predicting the fate and transport of colloid associated contaminants nutrients and trace metals in this work we have characterized the chemical and physical properties of humic acid based ha mn iii colloids formed over a range of environmentally relevant conditions and quantified their subsequent aggregation and stability behaviors results show that molar c mn ratios and ha types aldrich ha aha and pahokee peat soil ha ppsha are critical factors influencing ha mn iii colloidal properties both the amount and the stability of ha mn iii colloids increased with increasing initial molar c mn ratios regardless of ha type the correlation between the critical coagulation concentration ccc and zeta potential r2 0 97 suggests that both derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo type and non dlvo interactions are responsible for enhanced stability of ha mn iii colloids for a given c mn ratio ppsha mn iii colloids are significantly more stable against aggregation than aha mn iii colloids which is likely due to stronger electrostatic interactions hydration interactions and steric hindrance further examination in real world waters indicates that the ha mn iii colloids are highly stable in surface river water but become unstable i e extensive aggregation in solutions representing a groundwater seawater interaction zone overall this study provides new insights into the formation and stability of nom mn iii colloids which are critical for understanding mn based colloidal behavior s and thus

metal that occurs in various geological and environmental settings and can partake in a broad range of biogeochemical processes sunda and kieber 1994 post 1999 johnson 2006 madison et al 2011 2013 gude et al 2017 traditionally mn is considered to be predominantly present as soluble mn ii in anoxic and in particulate form mn iv iii in oxic environments stumm and morgan 1996 dissolved mn iii in natural waters has been largely understudied as it is thermodynamically unstable and rapidly disproportionate to mn ii and mn iv stumm and morgan 1996 however molecular orbital theory has substantiated that the donating and accepting orbitals of mn ii and mn iv are spatially distinct indicating that mn ii oxidation and mn iv reduction should proceed via a one electron transfer with mn iii as the intermediate luther 2005 consequently mn iii can be isolated and stabilized in aqueous solutions under appropriate conditions mounting field evidences highlight the prevalence of dissolved mn iii bound to a variety of organic ligands e g humic substances mn iii l complexes in aqueous systems trouwborst et al 2006 oldham 2017 recent studies demonstrated that 1 mn iii l complexes can constitute the majority of the total dissolved mn pool in anoxic suboxic and oxic environments in oceans and estuary sediments and 2 these species can serve as both oxidant and reductant and thus have important roles in the coupled cycles of carbon iron and sulfur trouwborst et al 2006 madison et al 2013 oldham et al 2017a oldham 2017 the formation of mn iii l complexes has been proposed to occur through a sequence of reaction pathways that include oxidation reduction and ligand promoted dissolution of mn bearing minerals madison et al 2013 oldham 2017 in additional to natural systems mn iii l complexes can also form in situ during oxidative water treatment using mn vii chemicals sun et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 resulting mn iii l complexes have been verified to be strong oxidants and can contribute to the transformation of anthropogenic contaminants sun et al 2015 hu et al 2017 gao et al 2018 in addition to dissolved species organic mn iii l complexes also exist as colloids oldham 2017 documented that mn iii has a strong affinity with natural organic matter nom such as humic substances although these humic type mn iii l complexes were identified to be largely non colloidal operationally defined as size class between 20 and 200 nm oldham et al 2017b speculated that a minor fraction of mn iii humic complexes do exist as colloids as colloids are broadly defined as dispersed particles with sizes between 1 nm and 1000 nm in diameter elimelech et al 1995 the amount of dissolved mn iii l complexes estimated using the previous definition 200 450 nm should include both truly soluble e g 1 20 nm and colloidal based mn iii a recent study provided a compelling evidence that mn iii l complexes in ocean exist both in colloidal form 20 400 nm and truly dissolved form 20 nm with colloids constituting up to 90 of the total mn iii yakushev 2013 in contrast to a growing body of studies pertaining to dissolved mn iii associated with nom little is known about the properties and behaviors of nom mn iii colloids in aquatic environments this is likely due to the fact that the researchers have traditionally used filters of 0 2 μm or 0 45 μm pore size to separate samples into dissolved and particulate phases wu et al 2001 oldham 2017 further results from previous field and laboratory studies indicate that the colloidal phase of nom metals e g fe complexes can act as mobile carriers facilitating the transport of low solubility contaminants at rates and distances much greater than the soluble phase of nom metals pokrovsky and schott 2002 fanun 2014 this warrants further studies to elucidate the formation properties and subsequent behaviors e g aggregation of nom mn iii colloids in an effort to accurately elucidate their fate and even potential as vectors in sequestrating and mobilizing contaminants additionally aggregation behavior of nom mn iii colloids may significantly affect their reactivity and mass flux as well as the fate and transport of priority contaminants it has also demonstrated that the ratio of nom to metal is an important factor influencing the formation and stability of nom metals colloids liao et al 2017a mensch et al 2017 previous studies suggest that nom from different sources has distinct effects on the colloidal behaviors of carbon based colloids jiang et al 2017 although the role of nom on the aggregation of engineered mn iv colloids has been evaluated huangfu et al 2013 the aggregation of naturally formed nom mn iii colloids has not been specifically evaluated the objectives of this study are to provide new insights into the formation e g concentration and properties and stability i e aggregation of nom mn iii colloids in aqueous environments see table 1 the central hypothesis in this study is that the molar ratio of c mn and different types of nom can significantly affect the formation and aggregation of nom mn iii colloids to test this nom mn iii colloids were generated in batch experiments over a range of environmentally relevant c mn ratios with different nom types and those colloids and their aggregation behaviors were subsequently characterized using a suite of complementary characterization techniques the stability of the formed nom mn iii colloids in real river and groundwater were also examined findings add a perspective to understanding of the stability of nom mn iii colloids and the ability to quantitatively predict the fate of contaminants nutrients and trace metals associated with nom mn iii colloids in aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all reagent solutions were prepared using ultrapure water resistivity 18 2 mω cm milli q millipore a stock solution of mn iii was prepared by dissolving 0 0134 g of manganese iii acetate dihydrate 97 alfa aesar solid in 500 ml water to reach a concentration of 100 μm two sources of humic acid ha one from aldrich ha aha sigma aldrich and the other extracted from pahokee florida peat soils ppsha 2bs103p international humic substances society ihss which have been extensively used in previous studies meyer et al 2015 liao et al 2017a b jiang et al 2017 were selected as model nom compounds in this study both ha stock solutions were prepared by introducing 2 5 g of the dry ha power in 500 ml water and adjusting ph to 10 5 using 1 m naoh the mixture was allowed to stir on a magnetic stirrer for 24 h in the dark and the resulting solution was filtered through 0 45 μm nitrocellulose filters millipore the total organic carbon toc in the aha and ppsha stock suspensions was determined to be 1661 7 and 1715 16 mg c l respectively using a toc analyzer multi n c 3100 analytik jena germany specific uv absorbance suva254 for both has were determined by diluting has stock solutions to different concentrations i e 1 10 mg c l and measure their uv absorbance at 254 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer cary 60 agilent both stock suspensions were then used to create suspensions with different working concentrations for subsequent experiments the properties of the two has are summarized in table 2 2 2 formation and characterization of ha mn iii colloids duplicate batch experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of molar c mn ratios and ha types on ha mn iii colloids formation all reactions took place under oxic conditions in capped and stirred glass reactors 50 ml that were shielded with aluminum foil to prevent photochemical reactions of mn that may generate reactive oxygen species the solutions in all the reactors were maintained at ph 7 0 using naoh and or hcl nom mn iii colloids formation experiment was initiated by mixing aliquots of fresh mn iii stock solution with an array of ha aha and ppsha working suspensions at concentrations ranging from 0 to 30 mg c l with a final mn iii concentration of 50 μm and molar c mn ratios of 0 50 these molar ratios were chosen because they cover a range of c mn molar ratios typically observed in sediments and tidal rivers the suspensions were equilibrated under a stir condition 600 rpm for 12 h at room temperature duplicate control experiments were performed in parallel using ha suspension alone samples from different reactors at the termination of the experiments were collected for chemical analysis characterization and for subsequent aggregation experiments described in the next section the concentrations of mn and ha in different size fractions were first quantified by wet chemical analysis colloids defined in this study as particles ranging from 10000 da roughly equal to 1 3 nm to 0 45 μm sample passed through the 10000 da ultrafiltration membrane was defined as truly soluble and that retained on the 0 45 μm filter was defined as particulate species the fractions of mn and ha in truly dissolved species roughly equal to 1 3 nm colloids 1 3 to 450 nm and particulates 450 nm were operationally separated from samples by 10000 da ultrafiltration membranes emd millipore and 0 45 μm filters pes whatman total mn concentration in each fraction was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7700 series after acidification of the samples with 2 hno3 although the icp ms could not differentiate the valence of mn our x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps results shown below confirmed mn iii dominated the ha concentration in each fraction was quantified by a toc analyzer described above the surface properties and crystalline nature of ha mn colloids were characterized using fourier transform infrared ftir xps and powder x ray diffraction xrd solid samples were obtained by ultracentrifugation followed by freeze drying ftir spectra were recorded using a diffuse reflectance accessory coupled to a nicolet is 50 ftir instrument thermo samples were mixed with kbr powder at a 1 10 ratio in an agate mortar and pestle a kbr background spectrum was collected for subtraction before collecting the sample spectrum xps spectra were collected using a phi quantera sxm scanning x ray microprobe with an al mono source the analyses were conducted at 26 ev pass energy at a 200 μm x ray spot size calibration was performed by alignment

ha mn suspensions were determined by dynamic light scattering dls using a zetasizer nano malvern uk measurements were also made to monitor the electrophoretic mobility which was subsequently converted to zeta potential using the smoluchowski approximation elimelech et al 1995 for each measurement approximately 1 ml of the suspension was added into a polystyrene cuvette and analyzed immediately the structure and morphology of ha mn colloids were determined by a double spherical aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscope cs corrected stem thermo fisher titan themis g2 60 300 operating at 300 kv and equipped with a high brightness x feg schottky field emission gun and four super x silicon drift x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy eds detectors that can produce ultrahigh x ray count rates for elemental identification on a sub nano or atomic scale the imaging was performed in stem mode using high angle annular dark field haadf detector samples were prepared by placing 20 μl of ha mn suspension onto both side of a 10 nm thick windows of silicon nitride sin membrane sn100 simpore inc usa with the aim to obtain high resolution microscopy images and eliminate the interference of background carbon in collecting the elemental mapping of ha mn colloids the water remaining in the sin window was immediately evaporated at room temperature under vacuum 2 3 aggregation of ha mn iii colloids time resolved dls was used to evaluate the aggregation kinetics of formed nom mn iii colloids by monitoring their early stage of z averaged hydrodynamic diameter with time over a wide range of electrolyte concentrations ha mn iii colloids were separated by successive fractionation of the equilibrated samples with different molar c mn ratios using 10 kda ultrafiltration and 0 45 μm filters as described above the resulting ha mn iii colloids obtained under all conditions different c mn ratios and different ha types are visually stable fig s2 because negligible aggregation of ha mn iii colloids was observed for high monovalent cation concentrations i e 1000 mm nacl fig s3 we devote our consideration of aggregation as a function of divalent cations the aggregation kinetics of ha mn iii colloids were initiated by introducing an electrolyte with a divalent cation ca2 and mg2 that induced aggregation ca2 and mg2 were selected as they are naturally abundant and are widely used in prior studies as representative divalent cations for particle aggregation chen et al 2006 philippe and schaumann 2014 li et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 xu et al 2017 for each measurement an appropriate volume of ha mn iii colloids suspension 1 ml at a given molar c mn ratio was pipetted into a cuvette subsequently a pre determined amount of electrolyte stock solution was quickly transferred into the cuvette to obtain a desired electrolyte concentration the cuvette a total volume of 1 ml was vigorously vortexed before being inserted into the dls chamber immediately after the initial change in the average hydrodynamic diameter dh was monitored every 15 s over a time period of 20 min control experiments with ha alone 10 mg c l were performed with the same procedures and range of electrolyte concentrations the early state aggregation rate constant of ha mn iii colloids k was acquired by measuring the increase in d h with time t 1 k 1 n 0 d d h t d t t 0 where n 0 is the initial particle concentration in the suspension the initial slope d d h t t 0 was calculated from a linear least squares regression analysis of the increase in d h up to the point where d d h t reaches 1 5 d d h 0 the aggregation attachment efficiency α which is the inverse stability ratio that ranges from 0 to 1 was calculated by normalizing the initial aggregation rate constant obtained at a given electrolyte concentration k to that under diffusion limited nonrepulsive fast aggregation conditions k fast given that n 0 was kept constant throughout each aggregation

pearl river delta southern china n22 44 46 85 e113 46 05 67 natural groundwater 18 m depth was collected from a groundwater seawater interaction zone that is in close proximity to the maozhou river n22 47 38 51 e113 49 28 43 the resulting groundwater was mixed with di water in different proportions to generate a set of solutions with different salinity the detailed locations for surface and groundwater sampling points is displayed in fig s1 detailed sampling and characterization of the water samples can be found in supplementary material and a summary of water chemistry composition is provided in table s1 the stability of ha mn iii colloids was measured by dispersing ha mn iii colloids both for aha mn iii and ppsha mn iii with the same molar c mn ratio of 50 in each solutions and then monitoring size changes over time via tr dls measurements were taken every 20 s for 1 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of nom mn iii colloids concentration distributions of mn in ha mn iii suspensions under steady state conditions show that the colloidal fraction of mn iii 1 3 450 nm increases with increasing initial molar c mn ratio fig 1 a and b no colloidal mn iii was observed in the absence of ha c mn 0 for both aha and ppsha the colloidal mn iii concentration increased linearly with increasing initial molar c mn ratio from 0 to 10 followed by a progressive approach to a maximum 36 0 for aha mn iii and 43 0 for ppsha mn iii with a further increase in c mn ratio to 50 fig 1a and b truly soluble mn iii 1 3 nm correspondingly dropped from 38 to 2 7 for aha mn iii suspension and to 3 5 for ppsha mn iii suspension given that the particulate mn iii 450 nm did not substantially change with the change in c mn ratio fig 1a and b an increase in colloidal mn iii can readily be attributed to the decrease in truly soluble mn iii consistent with the changes of mn iii in different size fractions the truly soluble ha diminished linearly from 85 to 20 as the initial c mn ratio increased from 2 5 to 50 with most of the increase in ha appearing in the colloidal fraction fig 1c and d this is in contrast to control results in the absence of mn iii whereby ha existed primarily in colloidal forms over a range of ha concentrations 2 5 30 mg c l fig 1e such discrepancy in has size distribution before and after reacting with mn iii is attributed to interactions between mn iii and ha for instance the sharp increase in truly soluble ha at lower initial molar c mn ratios 5 0 is likely due to the complexation of ha with truly soluble mn iii via ligand exchange mechanism oldham 2017 which may lower the free fraction of colloidal ha a qualitative distribution comparisons indicate that the complexation of truly soluble mn iii by ha and the subsequent coagulation of ha macromolecular particles were responsible for the formation of nom mn iii colloids an excellent logarithmic correlation between the colloidal mn iii and colloidal ha further confirmed the colloidal association between mn iii and ha fig s4 to further quantitatively probe the association between mn iii and ha for ha mn iii colloids formation we evaluated the ratio of the average stability constants for mn iii bound by truly soluble ha to that of mn iii bound by colloidal ha k mn iii sol ha k mn iii coll ha fig 1f wu et al 2001 the ratios of k mn iii sol ha k mn iii coll ha were determined to be 1 0 when the initial c mn molar ratio exceeds 5 0 suggesting that colloidal ha may have a higher affinity for associating mn iii than truly soluble ha additionally the ratio of k mn iii sol ha k mn iii coll ha for ppsha systems is consistently lower than that for aha systems demonstrating that ppsha has a higher preference for mn iii compared to aha for ha mn iii colloids formation it is noteworthy that the colloidal molar c mn ratios i e the ratio of ha and mn concentrations in the colloidal fraction are positively correlated with the initial molar c mn ratios for both has r2 0 998 fig s5 a slope of 2 0 suggests that ha mn iii colloids accounted for 50 of total ha mn iii complexes this is in contrast to our recent study showing that the majority 90 of ha fe iii complexes were colloids until the initial molar c fe ratios exceeds 1 6 liao et al 2017a taken together our findings indicate that the relative amount of ha mn iii colloids increased with increasing molar c mn ratios and that ppsha has stronger association with mn iii compared to aha for ha mn iii colloids formation further additional evidence supporting this conclusion is provided by complementary characterization data presented below 3 2 characterization of nom mn iii colloids resulting chemical properties of ha mn iii colloids were determined using ftir spectroscopy fig 2 a the ftir spectra of ha mn iii colloids are significantly different from has prior to reaction compared to ha samples a strong adsorption band at 510 cm 1 appeared in ha mn iii systems this peak was attributed to the formation of mn3 o structure as discussed by others julien et al 2004 the asymmetric and symmetric coo bands at 1595 and 1390 cm 1 in ha samples also become smaller and shift to 1610 and 1400 cm 1 for ha mn iii samples such a shift and change in the shape of coo stretching bands is typically linked to the carboxylate metal bond formation sharma et al 2010 chen et al 2014 thus suggesting that coo is likely the main functional group of ha for associating with mn iii with respect to ha mn iii colloids formation similar observations have been reported for nom fe iii colloids sharma et al 2010 a comparison of the peak intensity at 1400 cm 1 suggests that a higher coo amount occurs in ppsha mn iii colloids relative to aha mn iii colloids at comparable c mn ratio the crystalline nature of the formed ha mn iii was also identified by powder xrd fig 2b xrd patterns of both aha mn iii and ppsha mn iii colloids formed at an initial molar c mn ratio of 50 showed no obvious characteristic peaks for mn iii oxides indicative of poor crystallinity or amorphous materials surface sensitive xps was further used to characterize surface properties of ha mn iii colloids fig 2c f the quantification of mn valence state on the solid surface suggests that no redox reaction occurs between ha and mn iii throughout the experiments as the average oxidation state of mn was determined to be 3 04 fig 2c and d which is close to 3 0 of mn iii the deconvoluted peaks of c 1s spectra shows that the carboxyl carbon amounts e g oc o for ppsha mn iii colloids was slightly higher than for aha mn iii colloids fig 2e and f coinciding with ftir observations it is worth noting that the surface molar c mn ratios detected by xps were substantially higher than the colloidal molar c mn ratios and total molar c mn ratios table s2 this is likely a result of the uneven spatial distribution of ha in ha mn iii colloids with the ha being enriched on the colloid surface similar observations have also been made regarding the relative enrichment of ha on the surfaces of nom fe colloids oleinikova et al 2017 liao et al 2017a the hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of formed ha mn iii colloids were monitored at experimental termination to explore their stability fig 3 regardless of the molar c mn ratios and the types of ha ha mn iii bulk suspensions without any filtration treatments have a broad size distribution and their z averaged hydrodynamic diameter approaches to 1200 nm fig 3a primarily due to the presence of larger portions of particulate mn iii suggesting a wide degree of aggregation sedimentation experiments i e 1 h duration support these observations showing that almost all aggregates settled out of suspension fig s6 in contrast ha mn iii colloids displayed a monodisperse and relatively narrow size distribution with a z averaged hydrodynamic diameter in the range of 150 250 nm which is similar to the size of ha alone in the control experiments fig s7a in contrast to the insignificant change in the zeta potential of ha alone at any concentration examined fig s7b the zeta potential of ha mn iii colloids became progressively more negative as molar c mn ratios increased fig 3b further ppsha mn iii colloids possessed an overall more negative charge than aha mn iii colloids this is primarily because of a relatively higher amount of deprotonated coo groups existing for ppsha mn iii colloids as discussed above ultrahigh resolution aberration corrected haadf stem imaging was employed to gain insights into the morphology and microscopic structural features of ha mn iii colloids fig 4 for both has systems ha mn iii colloids predominantly exhibited clear thin thread and ringlike structures fig 4a d that are analogous to humic substances previously imaged in the presence of fe iii myneni et al 1999 the average diameter of a single ring structure ranged from 20 to 80 nm as determined from the high magnification haadf images fig 4c and d selected area electron diffraction saed patterns showed poor crystallinity of both ha mn iii colloids figs s8a and d which is consistent with the powder xrd observations fig 2b atomic resolution tem images and fast fourier transform fft of micro grains further confirm the poor crystallinity of ha mn iii colloids figs s8b c e f because the intensity of haadf stem imaging is approximately proportional to the atomic number and sample thickness pennycook and nellist 2011 brighter portions in the haadf images are expected to be mn iii due to the fact that mn has the largest atomic number 55 compared to oxygen 8 and c 6 it is clear that mn iii was either homogenously or heterogeneously distributed in the ringlike structures of has fig 4c and d further confirming the close association of mn iii with ha through complexation more detailed information regarding the structure and distribution of ha mn iii colloids can be gained from the eds mapping results fig 4e and f which showed that the intensity of mn iii and ha are very well matched at the edge region of the ringlike structures 3 3 aggregation and stability of nom mn iii colloids the stability of nom mn iii colloids was evaluated using hydrodynamic diameter growth data fig s9 from which aggregation attachment efficiency was obtained over a range of divalent electrolyte concentrations fig 5 in both cacl2 and mgcl2 solutions nom mn iii colloids formed at different c mn ratios and different ha types exhibited distinct reaction limited aggregation rla and diffusion limited aggregation dla regimes suggesting that electrostatic derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo type interactions were the main mechanism for stabilization saleh et al 2008 aich et al 2016 similar observations have been reported for the aggregation of other nom based coated metal colloids or nanoparticles such as ha fe ii iii colloids higher order fullerene clusters dissolved black carbon diesel soot nanoparticles and graphene oxides aich et al 2016 chen and huang 2017 jiang et al 2017 liao et al 2017a xu et al 2017 within the rla at low electrolyte concentrations α 1 unfavorable an increase in salt concentration screened the surface charge as confirmed by the electrokinetic measurements showing that the zeta potentials of nom mn iii colloids became less negative with increasing salt concentration fig 6 this effectively diminished the electrostatic energy barrier for aggregation thus leading to the increase in the rate of particle particle attachment efficiency when the salt concentration exceeded the critical coagulation concentration ccc the repulsive energy barrier between particles is completely eliminated resulting in dla α 1 favorable and the changes of hydrodynamic diameter and attachment efficiency become independent of salt concentration fig 5 and fig s9 as the minimum electrolyte concentration required to completely destabilize a stable colloidal suspension ccc serves as an index to quantitatively evaluate and compare aqueous stability of colloidal particles the higher ccc values led to the higher stability degrees smith et al 2009 chen and huang 2017 liao et al 2017a nom mn iii colloids formed at higher c mn ratio are less vulnerable to aggregation and thus have a higher degree of stability fig 5 for both types of the ha ccc values increased in both cacl2 and mgcl2 solutions with increasing c mn ratio for instance the ccc value of aha mn iii colloids increased from 5 3 to 5 8 mm as the initial molar c mn ratio increased from 10 to 50 in cacl2 solutions and 14 6 17 mm as the initial molar c mn ratio increased from 25 to 50 in mgcl2 solutions fig 5 higher colloidal stability in the solutions with higher c mn ratios can be attributed to higher amounts of carboxylic groups from ha adsorbed on the colloidal surfaces which contribute negative charge thus relatively higher repulsion energy barriers between particles philippe and schaumann 2014 supporting evidence of this phenomenon can be found in electrokinetic measurements fig 6 which show that the zeta potential in both cacl2 and mgcl2 solutions become more negative with an increase in molar c mn ratio previous studies have also demonstrated that the ratio of nom to metals plays a significant role in the stabilization of metal nanoparticles through electrostatic and or steric interactions liao et al 2017a b note that the charge screening effect is more pronounced in the presence of ca2 compared to that of mg2 fig s10 as also observed by others due to the stronger complexation and bridging effect of ca2 relative to mg2 philippe and schaumann 2014 leading to higher aggregation potential as indicated by the lower ccc values fig 5c f ppsha mn iii colloids are more stable against aggregation than aha mn iii colloids across the entire studied range of c mn ratios as they show appreciably higher ccc values and lower aggregation rates for both cacl2 and mgcl2 electrolytes fig 5 and fig s11 possible explanations of these observations can be related to the varied properties of has of different origins that may exert a dynamic influence on colloidal stability through multiple mechanisms including electrostatic interactions hydration interactions and steric hindrance philippe and schaumann 2014 vindedahl et al 2016 the has properties examined in our study included elemental composition carbon functional group composition and suva254 table 2 as shown higher suva254 an indicator of aromatic content is a reflection of the higher aromatic content of aha relative to ppsha which qualitatively agrees with the aromatic ratio determined by 13c nmr table 2 however the possibility of aromatic functionality exerting a stabilizing effect in particle aggregation can be largely ruled out as the ccc values of ca2 and mg2 for aha mn iii colloids were much lower than those for ppsha mn iii colloids fig 5c f as previously discussed ppsha has more carboxylic groups than aha fig 2a table 2 thus relatively enhanced electrostatic repulsion i e stability this fact is further supported by the higher negative charge of ppsha mn iii colloids compared to aha mn iii colloids fig s12 additionally ppsha is likely to be less hydrophobicity compared to aha as reflected by the lower aliphatic ratio table 2 therefore the higher stability of ppsha mn iii colloids may also be due to the relatively higher hydrophilicity of ppsha contributing to stronger repulsive hydration interactions xu et al 2017 further steric hindrance originating from the adsorbed ha layer may also play an appreciable role in enhancing the stability of ppsha mn iii as observed by previous studies regarding the aggregation of metal and carbon based colloids huangfu et al 2013 aich et al 2016 liao et al 2017a to provide additional insights into particle stability mechanisms of ha mn iii colloids we employed a theoretical model that integrates the zeta potential into the ccc expression based on classic dlvo theory considering electrostatic repulsion and van der waals attraction forces using the derjaguin approximation the relationship between ccc and surface potential of particles can be obtained by the following equations see detailed derivation in the supplementary material hsu and kuo 1997 jiang et al 2016 3 c c c n n a 4 n λ tan h 4 a ψ 0 4 a 5 a b k 3 6 4 π ε 0 ε r 3 k b t 5 48 2

equations 3 5 show that ccc is proportional to zeta potential we plotted ccc with tan h 4 a ψ 0 4 and found that they display a strong linear correlation r2 0 97 regardless of the electrolytes fig 7 a d this reinforces a strong dominance of dlvo type interactions in governing ha mn iii colloids stability however we note that the extrapolation of the fitting lines does not across zero implying that the additional non dlvo interactions such as hydration interactions and steric hindrance described above may also have contributed to the enhanced stability of ha mn iii colloids further the higher slope observed in ppsha systems also likely supports higher observed ccc values of ppsha mn iii colloids relative to aha mn iii colloids the hamaker constant of ha mn iii colloids in water estimated from eq 4 can range from 1 72 to 4 06 10 20 j this is within the same order of magnitude but is lower than the hamaker constant for mno2 colloids in aqueous solution 7 84 10 20 j huangfu et al 2013 the derived hamaker constant can be then used to calculate the dlvo interaction energies dlvo profiles clearly show that an increase in c mn ratios increased the repulsion energy barrier potential resulting in higher electrostatic and electrosteric repulsion fig 7e and f the repulsion energy barrier was higher for ppsha mn iii colloids than that for aha mn iii colloids fig 7e and f indicating relatively higher aggregation resistance for ppsha mn iii colloids 3 4 stability of nom mn iii colloids in natural aqueous matrices the colloidal stability mechanisms explored above in simple solutions can be used to assess the stability of ha mn iii colloids in more complex natural waters fig 8 in a river water sample the equivalent ionic strength of cations is considerably lower than the estimated ccc values for divalent electrolytes i e ca2 and mg2 table s1 consequently a near complete stabilization of nom mn iii colloids was observed as the particle s hydrodynamic diameter remained unchanged 1 h fig 8a and b in groundwater by contrast the ionic strength is much higher than the ccc values table s1 a rapid aggregation of ha mn iii colloids was observed with a particle size increase from starting 200 nm quickly to 1000 nm within the first 30 min fig 8a and b such a disparity in ha mn iii colloids stabilization suggest that the ccc value may be an indicator of overall colloidal stability in natural waters consistent with the similar findings from other studies smith et al 2009 chen et al 2017 although the groundwater also contained high concentrations of na cl and so4 2 table s1 the influence of these ions on the stability of ha mn iii colloids was minimal due to the insignificant change of hydrodynamic diameter in controlled experiments not shown when the groundwater was diluted with di water aggregation rate was monotonically decreased as the groundwater proportion decreased fig 8c owing to the decrease in the fractions of ca2 and mg2 at the groundwater to di ratio of 1 4 no appreciably aggregation was observed due to the much lower divalent electrolytes compared to the ccc value for ca2 and mg2 consistent with the ccc values the aggregation rate of ppsha mn iii colloids was lower than that of aha mn iii colloids fig 8c 4 conclusions this is the first report on the formation and stability of nom mn iii colloids in aqueous systems based on a suite of complementary characterization techniques it can be concluded that relative amount and stability of ha mn iii colloids generally increases with increasing molar c mn ratios and that ha with more surface deprotonated coo group and hydrophilicity result in higher stability likely due to stronger electrostatic repulsion hydration interactions and steric hindrance this study also supports the use of ccc values focused on divalent cations as a relatively simple index to evaluate colloidal stability in natural water samples overall the results provide valuable insights towards understanding of c and mn geochemistry in aqueous systems which also have implications regarding the fate and transport of associated contaminants nutrients and trace metals as observed the stability of ha mn iii colloids in fluvial systems likely enhances the transport of mn and c to the coast influencing the deposition and mass flux and the fractionation of mn and c along the salinity gradients in estuary systems ha mn iii colloids with enhanced stability at higher c mn ratios may exert a profound influence on the transport and transformation of contaminants as mn iii is highly redox active and can donate and or accept electrons we recognize that natural environments are more complicated than systems presented further studies are therefore needed to investigate such redox

19145,soluble mn iii species stabilized by natural organic matter nom plays a crucial role in a number of biogeochemical processes to date current understanding of these phenomena has been primarily concerned on the occurrence and chemistry of soluble nom mn iii complexes much less is known regarding the formation and stability of nom mn iii colloids in the environment this presents a critical knowledge gap with regard to biogeochemical cycling of manganese and associated carbon and for predicting the fate and transport of colloid associated contaminants nutrients and trace metals in this work we have characterized the chemical and physical properties of humic acid based ha mn iii colloids formed over a range of environmentally relevant conditions and quantified their subsequent aggregation and stability behaviors results show that molar c mn ratios and ha types aldrich ha aha and pahokee peat soil ha ppsha are critical factors influencing ha mn iii colloidal properties both the amount and the stability of ha mn iii colloids increased with increasing initial molar c mn ratios regardless of ha type the correlation between the critical coagulation concentration ccc and zeta potential r2 0 97 suggests that both derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo type and non dlvo interactions are responsible for enhanced stability of ha mn iii colloids for a given c mn ratio ppsha mn iii colloids are significantly more stable against aggregation than aha mn iii colloids which is likely due to stronger electrostatic interactions hydration interactions and steric hindrance further examination in real world waters indicates that the ha mn iii colloids are highly stable in surface river water but become unstable i e extensive aggregation in solutions representing a groundwater seawater interaction zone overall this study provides new insights into the formation and stability of nom mn iii colloids which are critical for understanding mn based colloidal behavior s and thus mn cycling processes in aquatic systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords nom mn iii colloids c mn ratios ha types colloid formation colloid stability 1 introduction manganese mn is a redox active metal that occurs in various geological and environmental settings and can partake in a broad range of biogeochemical processes sunda and kieber 1994 post 1999 johnson 2006 madison et al 2011 2013 gude et al 2017 traditionally mn is considered to be predominantly present as soluble mn ii in anoxic and in particulate form mn iv iii in oxic environments stumm and morgan 1996 dissolved mn iii in natural waters has been largely understudied as it is thermodynamically unstable and rapidly disproportionate to mn ii and mn iv stumm and morgan 1996 however molecular orbital theory has substantiated that the donating and accepting orbitals of mn ii and mn iv are spatially distinct indicating that mn ii oxidation and mn iv reduction should proceed via a one electron transfer with mn iii as the intermediate luther 2005 consequently mn iii can be isolated and stabilized in aqueous solutions under appropriate conditions mounting field evidences highlight the prevalence of dissolved mn iii bound to a variety of organic ligands e g humic substances mn iii l complexes in aqueous systems trouwborst et al 2006 oldham 2017 recent studies demonstrated that 1 mn iii l complexes can constitute the majority of the total dissolved mn pool in anoxic suboxic and oxic environments in oceans and estuary sediments and 2 these species can serve as both oxidant and reductant and thus have important roles in the coupled cycles of carbon iron and sulfur trouwborst et al 2006 madison et al 2013 oldham et al 2017a oldham 2017 the formation of mn iii l complexes has been proposed to occur through a sequence of reaction pathways that include oxidation reduction and ligand promoted dissolution of mn bearing minerals madison et al 2013 oldham 2017 in additional to natural systems mn iii l complexes can also form in situ during oxidative water treatment using mn vii chemicals sun et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 resulting mn iii l complexes have been verified to be strong oxidants and can contribute to the transformation of anthropogenic contaminants sun et al 2015 hu et al 2017 gao et al 2018 in addition to dissolved species organic mn iii l complexes also exist as colloids oldham 2017 documented that mn iii has a strong affinity with natural organic matter nom such as humic substances although these humic type mn iii l complexes were identified to be largely non colloidal operationally defined as size class between 20 and 200 nm oldham et al 2017b speculated that a minor fraction of mn iii humic complexes do exist as colloids as colloids are broadly defined as dispersed particles with sizes between 1 nm and 1000 nm in diameter elimelech et al 1995 the amount of dissolved mn iii l complexes estimated using the previous definition 200 450 nm should include both truly soluble e g 1 20 nm and colloidal based mn iii a recent study provided a compelling evidence that mn iii l complexes in ocean exist both in colloidal form 20 400 nm and truly dissolved form 20 nm with colloids constituting up to 90 of the total mn iii yakushev 2013 in contrast to a growing body of studies pertaining to dissolved mn iii associated with nom little is known about the properties and behaviors of nom mn iii colloids in aquatic environments this is likely due to the fact that the researchers have traditionally used filters of 0 2 μm or 0 45 μm pore size to separate samples into dissolved and particulate phases wu et al 2001 oldham 2017 further results from previous field and laboratory studies indicate that the colloidal phase of nom metals e g fe complexes can act as mobile carriers facilitating the transport of low solubility contaminants at rates and distances much greater than the soluble phase of nom metals pokrovsky and schott 2002 fanun 2014 this warrants further studies to elucidate the formation properties and subsequent behaviors e g aggregation of nom mn iii colloids in an effort to accurately elucidate their fate and even potential as vectors in sequestrating and mobilizing contaminants additionally aggregation behavior of nom mn iii colloids may significantly affect their reactivity and mass flux as well as the fate and transport of priority contaminants it has also demonstrated that the ratio of nom to metal is an important factor influencing the formation and stability of nom metals colloids liao et al 2017a mensch et al 2017 previous studies suggest that nom from different sources has distinct effects on the colloidal behaviors of carbon based colloids jiang et al 2017 although the role of nom on the aggregation of engineered mn iv colloids has been evaluated huangfu et al 2013 the aggregation of naturally formed nom mn iii colloids has not been specifically evaluated the objectives of this study are to provide new insights into the formation e g concentration and properties and stability i e aggregation of nom mn iii colloids in aqueous environments see table 1 the central hypothesis in this study is that the molar ratio of c mn and different types of nom can significantly affect the formation and aggregation of nom mn iii colloids to test this nom mn iii colloids were generated in batch experiments over a range of environmentally relevant c mn ratios with different nom types and those colloids and their aggregation behaviors were subsequently characterized using a suite of complementary characterization techniques the stability of the formed nom mn iii colloids in real river and groundwater were also examined findings add a perspective to understanding of the stability of nom mn iii colloids and the ability to quantitatively predict the fate of contaminants nutrients and trace metals associated with nom mn iii colloids in aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all reagent solutions were prepared using ultrapure water resistivity 18 2 mω cm milli q millipore a stock solution of mn iii was prepared by dissolving 0 0134 g of manganese iii acetate dihydrate 97 alfa aesar solid in 500 ml water to reach a concentration of 100 μm two sources of humic acid ha one from aldrich ha aha sigma aldrich and the other extracted from pahokee florida peat soils ppsha 2bs103p international humic substances society ihss which have been extensively used in previous studies meyer et al 2015 liao et al 2017a b jiang et al 2017 were selected as model nom compounds in this study both ha stock solutions were prepared by introducing 2 5 g of the dry ha power in 500 ml water and adjusting ph to 10 5 using 1 m naoh the mixture was allowed to stir on a magnetic stirrer for 24 h in the dark and the resulting solution was filtered through 0 45 μm nitrocellulose filters millipore the total organic carbon toc in the aha and ppsha stock suspensions was determined to be 1661 7 and 1715 16 mg c l respectively using a toc analyzer multi n c 3100 analytik jena germany specific uv absorbance suva254 for both has were determined by diluting has stock solutions to different concentrations i e 1 10 mg c l and measure their uv absorbance at 254 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer cary 60 agilent both stock suspensions were then used to create suspensions with different working concentrations for subsequent experiments the properties of the two has are summarized in table 2 2 2 formation and characterization of ha mn iii colloids duplicate batch experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of molar c mn ratios and ha types on ha mn iii colloids formation all reactions took place under oxic conditions in capped and stirred glass reactors 50 ml that were shielded with aluminum foil to prevent photochemical reactions of mn that may generate reactive oxygen species the solutions in all the reactors were maintained at ph 7 0 using naoh and or hcl nom mn iii colloids formation experiment was initiated by mixing aliquots of fresh mn iii stock solution with an array of ha aha and ppsha working suspensions at concentrations ranging from 0 to 30 mg c l with a final mn iii concentration of 50 μm and molar c mn ratios of 0 50 these molar ratios were chosen because they cover a range of c mn molar ratios typically observed in sediments and tidal rivers the suspensions were equilibrated under a stir condition 600 rpm for 12 h at room temperature duplicate control experiments were performed in parallel using ha suspension alone samples from different reactors at the termination of the experiments were collected for chemical analysis characterization and for subsequent aggregation experiments described in the next section the concentrations of mn and ha in different size fractions were first quantified by wet chemical analysis colloids defined in this study as particles ranging from 10000 da roughly equal to 1 3 nm to 0 45 μm sample passed through the 10000 da ultrafiltration membrane was defined as truly soluble and that retained on the 0 45 μm filter was defined as particulate species the fractions of mn and ha in truly dissolved species roughly equal to 1 3 nm colloids 1 3 to 450 nm and particulates 450 nm were operationally separated from samples by 10000 da ultrafiltration membranes emd millipore and 0 45 μm filters pes whatman total mn concentration in each fraction was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7700 series after acidification of the samples with 2 hno3 although the icp ms could not differentiate the valence of mn our x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps results shown below confirmed mn iii dominated the ha concentration in each fraction was quantified by a toc analyzer described above the surface properties and crystalline nature of ha mn colloids were characterized using fourier transform infrared ftir xps and powder x ray diffraction xrd solid samples were obtained by ultracentrifugation followed by freeze drying ftir spectra were recorded using a diffuse reflectance accessory coupled to a nicolet is 50 ftir instrument thermo samples were mixed with kbr powder at a 1 10 ratio in an agate mortar and pestle a kbr background spectrum was collected for subtraction before collecting the sample spectrum xps spectra were collected using a phi quantera sxm scanning x ray microprobe with an al mono source the analyses were conducted at 26 ev pass energy at a 200 μm x ray spot size calibration was performed by alignment

ha mn suspensions were determined by dynamic light scattering dls using a zetasizer nano malvern uk measurements were also made to monitor the electrophoretic mobility which was subsequently converted to zeta potential using the smoluchowski approximation elimelech et al 1995 for each measurement approximately 1 ml of the suspension was added into a polystyrene cuvette and analyzed immediately the structure and morphology of ha mn colloids were determined by a double spherical aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscope cs corrected stem thermo fisher titan themis g2 60 300 operating at 300 kv and equipped with a high brightness x feg schottky field emission gun and four super x silicon drift x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy eds detectors that can produce ultrahigh x ray count rates for elemental identification on a sub nano or atomic scale the imaging was performed in stem mode using high angle annular dark field haadf detector samples were prepared by placing 20 μl of ha mn suspension onto both side of a 10 nm thick windows of silicon nitride sin membrane sn100 simpore inc usa with the aim to obtain high resolution microscopy images and eliminate the interference of background carbon in collecting the elemental mapping of ha mn colloids the water remaining in the sin window was immediately evaporated at room temperature under vacuum 2 3 aggregation of ha mn iii colloids time resolved dls was used to evaluate the aggregation kinetics of formed nom mn iii colloids by monitoring their early stage of z averaged hydrodynamic diameter with time over a wide range of electrolyte concentrations ha mn iii colloids were separated by successive fractionation of the equilibrated samples with different molar c mn ratios using 10 kda ultrafiltration and 0 45 μm filters as described above the resulting ha mn iii colloids obtained under all conditions different c mn ratios and different ha types are visually stable fig s2 because negligible aggregation of ha mn iii colloids was observed for high monovalent cation concentrations i e 1000 mm nacl fig s3 we devote our consideration of aggregation as a function of divalent cations the aggregation kinetics of ha mn iii colloids were initiated by introducing an electrolyte with a divalent cation ca2 and mg2 that induced aggregation ca2 and mg2 were selected as they are naturally abundant and are widely used in prior studies as representative divalent cations for particle aggregation chen et al 2006 philippe and schaumann 2014 li et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 xu et al 2017 for each measurement an appropriate volume of ha mn iii colloids suspension 1 ml at a given molar c mn ratio was pipetted into a cuvette subsequently a pre determined amount of electrolyte stock solution was quickly transferred into the cuvette to obtain a desired electrolyte concentration the cuvette a total volume of 1 ml was vigorously vortexed before being inserted into the dls chamber immediately after the initial change in the average hydrodynamic diameter dh was monitored every 15 s over a time period of 20 min control experiments with ha alone 10 mg c l were performed with the same procedures and range of electrolyte concentrations the early state aggregation rate constant of ha mn iii colloids k was acquired by measuring the increase in d h with time t 1 k 1 n 0 d d h t d t t 0 where n 0 is the initial particle concentration in the suspension the initial slope d d h t t 0 was calculated from a linear least squares regression analysis of the increase in d h up to the point where d d h t reaches 1 5 d d h 0 the aggregation attachment efficiency α which is the inverse stability ratio that ranges from 0 to 1 was calculated by normalizing the initial aggregation rate constant obtained at a given electrolyte concentration k to that under diffusion limited nonrepulsive fast aggregation conditions k fast given that n 0 was kept constant throughout each aggregation

pearl river delta southern china n22 44 46 85 e113 46 05 67 natural groundwater 18 m depth was collected from a groundwater seawater interaction zone that is in close proximity to the maozhou river n22 47 38 51 e113 49 28 43 the resulting groundwater was mixed with di water in different proportions to generate a set of solutions with different salinity the detailed locations for surface and groundwater sampling points is displayed in fig s1 detailed sampling and characterization of the water samples can be found in supplementary material and a summary of water chemistry composition is provided in table s1 the stability of ha mn iii colloids was measured by dispersing ha mn iii colloids both for aha mn iii and ppsha mn iii with the same molar c mn ratio of 50 in each solutions and then monitoring size changes over time via tr dls measurements were taken every 20 s for 1 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of nom mn iii colloids concentration distributions of mn in ha mn iii suspensions under steady state conditions show that the colloidal fraction of mn iii 1 3 450 nm increases with increasing initial molar c mn ratio fig 1 a and b no colloidal mn iii was observed in the absence of ha c mn 0 for both aha and ppsha the colloidal mn iii concentration increased linearly with increasing initial molar c mn ratio from 0 to 10 followed by a progressive approach to a maximum 36 0 for aha mn iii and 43 0 for ppsha mn iii with a further increase in c mn ratio to 50 fig 1a and b truly soluble mn iii 1 3 nm correspondingly dropped from 38 to 2 7 for aha mn iii suspension and to 3 5 for ppsha mn iii suspension given that the particulate mn iii 450 nm did not substantially change with the change in c mn ratio fig 1a and b an increase in colloidal mn iii can readily be attributed to the decrease in truly soluble mn iii consistent with the changes of mn iii in different size fractions the truly soluble ha diminished linearly from 85 to 20 as the initial c mn ratio increased from 2 5 to 50 with most of the increase in ha appearing in the colloidal fraction fig 1c and d this is in contrast to control results in the absence of mn iii whereby ha existed primarily in colloidal forms over a range of ha concentrations 2 5 30 mg c l fig 1e such discrepancy in has size distribution before and after reacting with mn iii is attributed to interactions between mn iii and ha for instance the sharp increase in truly soluble ha at lower initial molar c mn ratios 5 0 is likely due to the complexation of ha with truly soluble mn iii via ligand exchange mechanism oldham 2017 which may lower the free fraction of colloidal ha a qualitative distribution comparisons indicate that the complexation of truly soluble mn iii by ha and the subsequent coagulation of ha macromolecular particles were responsible for the formation of nom mn iii colloids an excellent logarithmic correlation between the colloidal mn iii and colloidal ha further confirmed the colloidal association between mn iii and ha fig s4 to further quantitatively probe the association between mn iii and ha for ha mn iii colloids formation we evaluated the ratio of the average stability constants for mn iii bound by truly soluble ha to that of mn iii bound by colloidal ha k mn iii sol ha k mn iii coll ha fig 1f wu et al 2001 the ratios of k mn iii sol ha k mn iii coll ha were determined to be 1 0 when the initial c mn molar ratio exceeds 5 0 suggesting that colloidal ha may have a higher affinity for associating mn iii than truly soluble ha additionally the ratio of k mn iii sol ha k mn iii coll ha for ppsha systems is consistently lower than that for aha systems demonstrating that ppsha has a higher preference for mn iii compared to aha for ha mn iii colloids formation it is noteworthy that the colloidal molar c mn ratios i e the ratio of ha and mn concentrations in the colloidal fraction are positively correlated with the initial molar c mn ratios for both has r2 0 998 fig s5 a slope of 2 0 suggests that ha mn iii colloids accounted for 50 of total ha mn iii complexes this is in contrast to our recent study showing that the majority 90 of ha fe iii complexes were colloids until the initial molar c fe ratios exceeds 1 6 liao et al 2017a taken together our findings indicate that the relative amount of ha mn iii colloids increased with increasing molar c mn ratios and that ppsha has stronger association with mn iii compared to aha for ha mn iii colloids formation further additional evidence supporting this conclusion is provided by complementary characterization data presented below 3 2 characterization of nom mn iii colloids resulting chemical properties of ha mn iii colloids were determined using ftir spectroscopy fig 2 a the ftir spectra of ha mn iii colloids are significantly different from has prior to reaction compared to ha samples a strong adsorption band at 510 cm 1 appeared in ha mn iii systems this peak was attributed to the formation of mn3 o structure as discussed by others julien et al 2004 the asymmetric and symmetric coo bands at 1595 and 1390 cm 1 in ha samples also become smaller and shift to 1610 and 1400 cm 1 for ha mn iii samples such a shift and change in the shape of coo stretching bands is typically linked to the carboxylate metal bond formation sharma et al 2010 chen et al 2014 thus suggesting that coo is likely the main functional group of ha for associating with mn iii with respect to ha mn iii colloids formation similar observations have been reported for nom fe iii colloids sharma et al 2010 a comparison of the peak intensity at 1400 cm 1 suggests that a higher coo amount occurs in ppsha mn iii colloids relative to aha mn iii colloids at comparable c mn ratio the crystalline nature of the formed ha mn iii was also identified by powder xrd fig 2b xrd patterns of both aha mn iii and ppsha mn iii colloids formed at an initial molar c mn ratio of 50 showed no obvious characteristic peaks for mn iii oxides indicative of poor crystallinity or amorphous materials surface sensitive xps was further used to characterize surface properties of ha mn iii colloids fig 2c f the quantification of mn valence state on the solid surface suggests that no redox reaction occurs between ha and mn iii throughout the experiments as the average oxidation state of mn was determined to be 3 04 fig 2c and d which is close to 3 0 of mn iii the deconvoluted peaks of c 1s spectra shows that the carboxyl carbon amounts e g oc o for ppsha mn iii colloids was slightly higher than for aha mn iii colloids fig 2e and f coinciding with ftir observations it is worth noting that the surface molar c mn ratios detected by xps were substantially higher than the colloidal molar c mn ratios and total molar c mn ratios table s2 this is likely a result of the uneven spatial distribution of ha in ha mn iii colloids with the ha being enriched on the colloid surface similar observations have also been made regarding the relative enrichment of ha on the surfaces of nom fe colloids oleinikova et al 2017 liao et al 2017a the hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of formed ha mn iii colloids were monitored at experimental termination to explore their stability fig 3 regardless of the molar c mn ratios and the types of ha ha mn iii bulk suspensions without any filtration treatments have a broad size distribution and their z averaged hydrodynamic diameter approaches to 1200 nm fig 3a primarily due to the presence of larger portions of particulate mn iii suggesting a wide degree of aggregation sedimentation experiments i e 1 h duration support these observations showing that almost all aggregates settled out of suspension fig s6 in contrast ha mn iii colloids displayed a monodisperse and relatively narrow size distribution with a z averaged hydrodynamic diameter in the range of 150 250 nm which is similar to the size of ha alone in the control experiments fig s7a in contrast to the insignificant change in the zeta potential of ha alone at any concentration examined fig s7b the zeta potential of ha mn iii colloids became progressively more negative as molar c mn ratios increased fig 3b further ppsha mn iii colloids possessed an overall more negative charge than aha mn iii colloids this is primarily because of a relatively higher amount of deprotonated coo groups existing for ppsha mn iii colloids as discussed above ultrahigh resolution aberration corrected haadf stem imaging was employed to gain insights into the morphology and microscopic structural features of ha mn iii colloids fig 4 for both has systems ha mn iii colloids predominantly exhibited clear thin thread and ringlike structures fig 4a d that are analogous to humic substances previously imaged in the presence of fe iii myneni et al 1999 the average diameter of a single ring structure ranged from 20 to 80 nm as determined from the high magnification haadf images fig 4c and d selected area electron diffraction saed patterns showed poor crystallinity of both ha mn iii colloids figs s8a and d which is consistent with the powder xrd observations fig 2b atomic resolution tem images and fast fourier transform fft of micro grains further confirm the poor crystallinity of ha mn iii colloids figs s8b c e f because the intensity of haadf stem imaging is approximately proportional to the atomic number and sample thickness pennycook and nellist 2011 brighter portions in the haadf images are expected to be mn iii due to the fact that mn has the largest atomic number 55 compared to oxygen 8 and c 6 it is clear that mn iii was either homogenously or heterogeneously distributed in the ringlike structures of has fig 4c and d further confirming the close association of mn iii with ha through complexation more detailed information regarding the structure and distribution of ha mn iii colloids can be gained from the eds mapping results fig 4e and f which showed that the intensity of mn iii and ha are very well matched at the edge region of the ringlike structures 3 3 aggregation and stability of nom mn iii colloids the stability of nom mn iii colloids was evaluated using hydrodynamic diameter growth data fig s9 from which aggregation attachment efficiency was obtained over a range of divalent electrolyte concentrations fig 5 in both cacl2 and mgcl2 solutions nom mn iii colloids formed at different c mn ratios and different ha types exhibited distinct reaction limited aggregation rla and diffusion limited aggregation dla regimes suggesting that electrostatic derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo type interactions were the main mechanism for stabilization saleh et al 2008 aich et al 2016 similar observations have been reported for the aggregation of other nom based coated metal colloids or nanoparticles such as ha fe ii iii colloids higher order fullerene clusters dissolved black carbon diesel soot nanoparticles and graphene oxides aich et al 2016 chen and huang 2017 jiang et al 2017 liao et al 2017a xu et al 2017 within the rla at low electrolyte concentrations α 1 unfavorable an increase in salt concentration screened the surface charge as confirmed by the electrokinetic measurements showing that the zeta potentials of nom mn iii colloids became less negative with increasing salt concentration fig 6 this effectively diminished the electrostatic energy barrier for aggregation thus leading to the increase in the rate of particle particle attachment efficiency when the salt concentration exceeded the critical coagulation concentration ccc the repulsive energy barrier between particles is completely eliminated resulting in dla α 1 favorable and the changes of hydrodynamic diameter and attachment efficiency become independent of salt concentration fig 5 and fig s9 as the minimum electrolyte concentration required to completely destabilize a stable colloidal suspension ccc serves as an index to quantitatively evaluate and compare aqueous stability of colloidal particles the higher ccc values led to the higher stability degrees smith et al 2009 chen and huang 2017 liao et al 2017a nom mn iii colloids formed at higher c mn ratio are less vulnerable to aggregation and thus have a higher degree of stability fig 5 for both types of the ha ccc values increased in both cacl2 and mgcl2 solutions with increasing c mn ratio for instance the ccc value of aha mn iii colloids increased from 5 3 to 5 8 mm as the initial molar c mn ratio increased from 10 to 50 in cacl2 solutions and 14 6 17 mm as the initial molar c mn ratio increased from 25 to 50 in mgcl2 solutions fig 5 higher colloidal stability in the solutions with higher c mn ratios can be attributed to higher amounts of carboxylic groups from ha adsorbed on the colloidal surfaces which contribute negative charge thus relatively higher repulsion energy barriers between particles philippe and schaumann 2014 supporting evidence of this phenomenon can be found in electrokinetic measurements fig 6 which show that the zeta potential in both cacl2 and mgcl2 solutions become more negative with an increase in molar c mn ratio previous studies have also demonstrated that the ratio of nom to metals plays a significant role in the stabilization of metal nanoparticles through electrostatic and or steric interactions liao et al 2017a b note that the charge screening effect is more pronounced in the presence of ca2 compared to that of mg2 fig s10 as also observed by others due to the stronger complexation and bridging effect of ca2 relative to mg2 philippe and schaumann 2014 leading to higher aggregation potential as indicated by the lower ccc values fig 5c f ppsha mn iii colloids are more stable against aggregation than aha mn iii colloids across the entire studied range of c mn ratios as they show appreciably higher ccc values and lower aggregation rates for both cacl2 and mgcl2 electrolytes fig 5 and fig s11 possible explanations of these observations can be related to the varied properties of has of different origins that may exert a dynamic influence on colloidal stability through multiple mechanisms including electrostatic interactions hydration interactions and steric hindrance philippe and schaumann 2014 vindedahl et al 2016 the has properties examined in our study included elemental composition carbon functional group composition and suva254 table 2 as shown higher suva254 an indicator of aromatic content is a reflection of the higher aromatic content of aha relative to ppsha which qualitatively agrees with the aromatic ratio determined by 13c nmr table 2 however the possibility of aromatic functionality exerting a stabilizing effect in particle aggregation can be largely ruled out as the ccc values of ca2 and mg2 for aha mn iii colloids were much lower than those for ppsha mn iii colloids fig 5c f as previously discussed ppsha has more carboxylic groups than aha fig 2a table 2 thus relatively enhanced electrostatic repulsion i e stability this fact is further supported by the higher negative charge of ppsha mn iii colloids compared to aha mn iii colloids fig s12 additionally ppsha is likely to be less hydrophobicity compared to aha as reflected by the lower aliphatic ratio table 2 therefore the higher stability of ppsha mn iii colloids may also be due to the relatively higher hydrophilicity of ppsha contributing to stronger repulsive hydration interactions xu et al 2017 further steric hindrance originating from the adsorbed ha layer may also play an appreciable role in enhancing the stability of ppsha mn iii as observed by previous studies regarding the aggregation of metal and carbon based colloids huangfu et al 2013 aich et al 2016 liao et al 2017a to provide additional insights into particle stability mechanisms of ha mn iii colloids we employed a theoretical model that integrates the zeta potential into the ccc expression based on classic dlvo theory considering electrostatic repulsion and van der waals attraction forces using the derjaguin approximation the relationship between ccc and surface potential of particles can be obtained by the following equations see detailed derivation in the supplementary material hsu and kuo 1997 jiang et al 2016 3 c c c n n a 4 n λ tan h 4 a ψ 0 4 a 5 a b k 3 6 4 π ε 0 ε r 3 k b t 5 48 2 e 6 a 131 2 π exp 2 5 λ 1 1 2 k 3 x 0 1 exp 2 k 3 x 0 2 where n is the number concentration of cations in bulk phase λ is a parameter calculated to be 1 0 for all the scenarios in this study na is the avogadro s number 6 02 1023 mol 1 ψ 0 is the dimensionless surface potential v a and b are the valences of cation and anion of the electrolyte respectively ε 0 is the dialectic permittivity in vacuum 8 854 10 12 c2 j m ε r is the relative dialectic permeability of water 78 5 k b is the boltzmann s constant 1 38 10 23 j k t is the absolute temperature 298 k k 3 is a parameter related to a and b for cacl2 and mgcl2 k 3 1 078 e is the elementary charge of an electron 1 60 10 19 c a 131 is the hamaker constant of ha mn iii colloids in water j and x 0 is the dimensionless radius of the particle m equations 3 5 show that ccc is proportional to zeta potential we plotted ccc with tan h 4 a ψ 0 4 and found that they display a strong linear correlation r2 0 97 regardless of the electrolytes fig 7 a d this reinforces a strong dominance of dlvo type interactions in governing ha mn iii colloids stability however we note that the extrapolation of the fitting lines does not across zero implying that the additional non dlvo interactions such as hydration interactions and steric hindrance described above may also have contributed to the enhanced stability of ha mn iii colloids further the higher slope observed in ppsha systems also likely supports higher observed ccc values of ppsha mn iii colloids relative to aha mn iii colloids the hamaker constant of ha mn iii colloids in water estimated from eq 4 can range from 1 72 to 4 06 10 20 j this is within the same order of magnitude but is lower than the hamaker constant for mno2 colloids in aqueous solution 7 84 10 20 j huangfu et al 2013 the derived hamaker constant can be then used to calculate the dlvo interaction energies dlvo profiles clearly show that an increase in c mn ratios increased the repulsion energy barrier potential resulting in higher electrostatic and electrosteric repulsion fig 7e and f the repulsion energy barrier was higher for ppsha mn iii colloids than that for aha mn iii colloids fig 7e and f indicating relatively higher aggregation resistance for ppsha mn iii colloids 3 4 stability of nom mn iii colloids in natural aqueous matrices the colloidal stability mechanisms explored above in simple solutions can be used to assess the stability of ha mn iii colloids in more complex natural waters fig 8 in a river water sample the equivalent ionic strength of cations is considerably lower than the estimated ccc values for divalent electrolytes i e ca2 and mg2 table s1 consequently a near complete stabilization of nom mn iii colloids was observed as the particle s hydrodynamic diameter remained unchanged 1 h fig 8a and b in groundwater by contrast the ionic strength is much higher than the ccc values table s1 a rapid aggregation of ha mn iii colloids was observed with a particle size increase from starting 200 nm quickly to 1000 nm within the first 30 min fig 8a and b such a disparity in ha mn iii colloids stabilization suggest that the ccc value may be an indicator of overall colloidal stability in natural waters consistent with the similar findings from other studies smith et al 2009 chen et al 2017 although the groundwater also contained high concentrations of na cl and so4 2 table s1 the influence of these ions on the stability of ha mn iii colloids was minimal due to the insignificant change of hydrodynamic diameter in controlled experiments not shown when the groundwater was diluted with di water aggregation rate was monotonically decreased as the groundwater proportion decreased fig 8c owing to the decrease in the fractions of ca2 and mg2 at the groundwater to di ratio of 1 4 no appreciably aggregation was observed due to the much lower divalent electrolytes compared to the ccc value for ca2 and mg2 consistent with the ccc values the aggregation rate of ppsha mn iii colloids was lower than that of aha mn iii colloids fig 8c 4 conclusions this is the first report on the formation and stability of nom mn iii colloids in aqueous systems based on a suite of complementary characterization techniques it can be concluded that relative amount and stability of ha mn iii colloids generally increases with increasing molar c mn ratios and that ha with more surface deprotonated coo group and hydrophilicity result in higher stability likely due to stronger electrostatic repulsion hydration interactions and steric hindrance this study also supports the use of ccc values focused on divalent cations as a relatively simple index to evaluate colloidal stability in natural water samples overall the results provide valuable insights towards understanding of c and mn geochemistry in aqueous systems which also have implications regarding the fate and transport of associated contaminants nutrients and trace metals as observed the stability of ha mn iii colloids in fluvial systems likely enhances the transport of mn and c to the coast influencing the deposition and mass flux and the fractionation of mn and c along the salinity gradients in estuary systems ha mn iii colloids with enhanced stability at higher c mn ratios may exert a profound influence on the transport and transformation of contaminants as mn iii is highly redox active and can donate and or accept electrons we recognize that natural environments are more complicated than systems presented further studies are therefore needed to investigate such redox properties and long term stability of nom mn iii colloids in realistic aquatic systems acknowledgments this work was supported by the natural science foundation of china no 41703128 41572228 41521001

19146,cryptosporidium is a leading cause of diarrhoea and infant mortality worldwide a better understanding of the sources fate and transport of cryptosporidium via rivers is important for effective management of waterborne transmission especially in the developing world we present glowpa crypto c1 the first global spatially explicit model that computes cryptosporidium concentrations in rivers implemented on a 0 5 0 5 grid and monthly time step to this end we first modelled cryptosporidium inputs to rivers from human faeces and animal manure next we use modelled hydrology from a grid based macroscale hydrological model the variable infiltration capacity model oocyst transport through the river network is modelled using a routing model accounting for temperature and solar radiation dependent decay and sedimentation along the way monthly average oocyst concentrations are predicted to range from 10 6 to 102 oocysts l 1 in most places critical regions hotspots with high concentrations include densely populated areas in india china pakistan and bangladesh nigeria algeria and south africa mexico venezuela and some coastal areas of brazil several countries in western and eastern europe incl the uk belgium and macedonia and the middle east point sources human faeces appears to be a more dominant source of pollution than diffuse sources mainly animal manure in most world regions validation shows that glowpa crypto medians are mostly within the range of observed concentrations the model generally produces concentrations that are 1 5 2 log10 higher than the observations this is likely predominantly due to the absence of recovery efficiency of the observations which are therefore likely too low goodness of fit statistics are reasonable sensitivity analysis showed that the model is most sensitive to changes in input oocyst loads glowpa crypto c1 paves the way for many new opportunities at the global scale including scenario analysis to investigate the impact of global change and management options on oocysts concentrations in rivers and risk analysis to investigate human health risk graphical abstract image 1 keywords pathogens water quality model transport surface water global 1 introduction diarrhoea is still a major cause of death worldwide especially in children younger than 5 years in developing countries gbd 2013 mortality and causes of death collaborators 2015 the zoonotic protozoan parasite cryptosporidium that is transmitted via the faecal oral route is an important cause of childhood diarrhoea and mortality liu et al 2016 infection can occur via direct contact with faeces of infected humans or animals zambrano et al 2014 but also often occurs via a waterborne route through the environment examples are drinking of river water or recreation in rivers contaminated with faeces shirley et al 2012 and consumption of fresh produce irrigated with contaminated water dixon 2016 oocysts the robust survival stage of the pathogen are excreted in faeces of infected humans and animals and can reach rivers either directly point sources such as sewer pipes or indirectly diffuse sources such as manure transported with surface runoff oocysts are transported with rivers and meanwhile decay and sedimentation decrease their viability and concentration gaining insight in the transmission of cryptosporidium via rivers is important for evaluating disease risk insight in the relative contribution of human versus animal sources point versus diffuse sources and pathways and effect of control measures are important to design effective management strategies but as sampling of cryptosporidium and other pathogen concentrations is expensive and laborious observational data are scarce especially for the developing world modelling is a common approach to increase insight for example by pinpointing hotspots of high concentrations or identifying the relative importance of pollutant sources in this study we aim to estimate cryptosporidium oocyst concentrations in rivers worldwide we present the model glowpa crypto c1 the global waterborne pathogen model for cryptosporidium concentrations version 1 a global spatially explicit model that calculates mean monthly oocyst concentrations in rivers 2 materials and methods glowpa crypto c1 couples the output from the loading

assess model performance fig 1 gives a schematic model representation all calculations are performed on a 0 5 0 5 grid and monthly time step using the software environment r r development core team 2016 we use the most recent available estimates for all input variables and we consider the model representative for approximately the conditions around the years 2005 2010 table s1 in the supplementary materials list the variables that are included in the model 2 1 sources of cryptosporidium 2 1 1 human sources human cryptosporidium loads to rivers are calculated in the glowpa crypto h1 model hofstra and vermeulen 2016 in brief glowpa crypto h1 calculates oocyst loads by multiplying human population data with estimates of cryptosporidium infection associated oocyst excretion and removal depending on the sanitation system used prevalence of cryptosporidium infection and oocyst excretion in humans are estimated from literature and gridded data of human population from landscan bright et al 2011 are divided in developed developing and urban rural depending on the sanitation systems used by the different populations from the who jmp joint monitoring program and assumptions on the removal of oocysts by sewage treatment the final load to rivers is calculated the model is programmed in r and operates on a 0 5 0 5 grid for the world at an annual time step and is representative for conditions in approximately the year 2010 the annual oocyst loads are divided by 12 as an estimate of monthly oocyst loads 2 1 2 animal sources animal cryptosporidium loads to land are calculated in the glowpa crypto l1 model vermeulen et al 2017 in brief livestock population data are from the gridded livestock of the world v2 0 robinson et al 2014 and prevalence and oocyst excretion by 11 livestock species cattle buffaloes pigs sheep goats horses camels donkeys mules chickens and ducks are based on an extensive literature review vermeulen et al 2017 the model differentiates between manure excreted directly on land during grazing and manure spread on land after storage and temperature dependent oocyst decay during storage is accounted for the model is programmed in r and operates on a 0 5 0 5 grid for the world at an annual time step and is representative for conditions in approximately the year 2005 the annual oocyst loads are divided by 12 as an estimate of monthly oocyst loads this means that the timing of the birthing season and application of stored manure on fields is not accounted for in the current version of the model as comprehensive global data on this are not available 2 2 oocyst transport from land to rivers transport of oocysts from the land to rivers largely depends on surface runoff as subsurface flow will generally transport few oocysts due to the filtering capacity of soils mawdsley et al 1996 mclaughlin et al 2013 in hofstra and vermeulen 2016 the load from the population that practices open defecation in rural areas a diffuse source was multiplied with a constant runoff fraction 0 025 to estimate the amount ending up in rivers using a constant runoff fraction does not account for the variability in runoff and associated transport therefore in glowpa crypto c1 we no longer use this constant runoff fraction but instead make oocyst transport from land to rivers dependent on surface runoff both for human diffuse sources and animal sources the vic model liang et al 1994 provides data of surface runoff mm day 1 and discharge m3 s 1 surface runoff and discharge are monthly mean averages of a baseline vic run with watch forcing data weedon et al 2011 averaged over the period 1970 2000 0 5 0 5 grid given a certain surface runoff we need to estimate the fraction of oocysts that is transported to rivers surface runoff will not transport all oocysts from manure to rivers a large part of the oocyst load will be retained within the faecal matrix or on the soil surface table 1 leading to a reduction of several log units of the oocyst load that will reach the river we found 9 studies that quantify the amount of oocysts that are transported with runoff from faecal deposits on land only one of which measured this under field conditions table 1 from table 1 we can see that both the faecal matrix and soils contribute to reducing the oocyst load in runoff and that vegetated soils do so more effectively than bare soils under field conditions larger retention is observed than under simulated rainfall which is likely partly due to decay as atwill et al 2006 measured oocysts in runoff over a period of one year during this year surface runoff varied from 0 to 20 mm we therefore choose to linearly assign the observed log oocyst retention from vegetated plots under field conditions 3 2 8 8 log10 to grid cells with runoff values ranging between 0 and 20 mm where highest runoff will get lowest retention and vice versa this approach is extrapolated and grid cells with higher runoff get assigned a retention between 1 and 3 2 log10 we assume that under field conditions at least 1 log10 oocysts is retained due to decay and landscape characteristics in months that surface runoff is zero oocyst retention is set to infinite oocyst stream input from diffuse sources sd is calculated by decreasing the animal oocyst loads on land as calculated with glowpa crypto l1 and the human diffuse oocyst loads as calculated with glowpa crypto h1 with the assigned retention the oocyst stream input from point sources sp is the total human load to rivers as calculated in glowpa crypto h1 minus the human diffuse sources modelling the release of cryptosporidium from manure to rivers is challenging given the scarcity of observational data we have also looked into the literature on existing modelling approaches and conclude there currently is no single gold standard approach to modelling the release of oocysts from manure and transport to rivers furthermore existing modelling approaches require too detailed input data in space and or time to directly apply them at a global scale on a monthly time step see supplementary material s2 for a more detailed discussion although crude the approach we have chosen accounts for spatial and monthly variability in surface runoff and the magnitude of retention is based on observations under field conditions atwill et al 2006 more experimental data on oocyst release from manure and transport to rivers under various climatic and landscape conditions is needed to refine this approach 2 3 oocyst survival during transport with rivers oocyst survival during transport can be modelled following standard first order decay 1 c t c 0 e k t where c t is the oocyst concentration after time t days c 0 is the initial concentration and k is the loss rate coefficient day 1 writing this in a different way the natural logarithm of the fraction that survives in month i fs i equals 2 ln f s i k i t i the loss rate coefficient k i day 1 can have several components thomann and mueller 1987 3 k i k t i k r i k s i k t i is the temperature dependent decay rate day 1 k r i is the solar radiation dependent decay rate day 1 and k s i is the loss rate due to sedimentation day 1 in month i see sections 2 3 1 2 3 3 water residence time in a grid cell t i is estimated as described in section 2 3 4 the supplementary material s4 contains some maps of the different loss components it is important to note that decay and sedimentation have partially different effects on the oocysts sedimentation has an effect on the concentration in the water phase directly while decay has an effect on the viability and infectivity of oocysts loss of viability and infectivity may lead to disintegration thereby reducing the concentration 2 3 1 temperature dependent survival kt to calculate temperature dependent survival during transport with rivers we use the approach by peng et al 2008 who compiled literature estimates on the survival of cryptosporidium in raw waters we apply the following relationship between k t and water temperature t w 4 k t i k 4 e λ t w i 4 where k 4 and k t i are respectively the decay rate coefficients day 1 at 4 c and water temperature t w i in month i and λ is a dimensionless constant for t w we use monthly mean water temperature as estimated by the vic rbm model framework which was applied globally van vliet et al 2012 this is a coupled hydrological water temperature model framework based on the vic model liang et al 1994 and rbm stream temperature model yearsley 2009 monthly mean water temperature is calculated as a 24 h mean extended to 30 days for k 4 and λ we take the values reported for cell culture studies in raw waters by peng et al these are k 4 0 0051 day 1 and λ 0 158 peng et al 2008 in their review peng et al distinguished between studies reporting cryptosporidium survival for dapi pi or excystation studies and studies that used cell culture to measure oocyst infectivity for water temperatures between 4 and 20 c observed k values were similar but for temperatures over 25 c k values from cell culture studies were notably higher peng et al 2008 meaning that in the high temperature range dapi pi and excystation studies likely overestimate the survival of infectious oocysts therefore we take the values reported for cell culture studies for waters below 4 c few studies have been done peng et al 2008 we therefore assume that survival in waters below 4 c is the same as at 4 c other models of cryptosporidium in rivers use similar k values for temperature dependent decay see supplementary material s3 2 3 2 solar radiation dependent survival k r for k r we can follow mancini 1978 and thomann and mueller 1987 to calculate water depth averaged solar radiation dependent decay 5 k r i k l i a i k e z i 1 e k e z i where i a i is the average surface solar radiation kj m 2 day 1 in month i k l is a proportionality constant m2 kj 1 k e is the attenuation coefficient m 1 and z i is the water depth m in month i surface solar radiation data are from the watch forcing data weedon et al 2011 the ultraviolet uv part of solar radiation is most important in decreasing oocyst infectivity connelly et al 2007 attenuation of uv radiation in water is influenced by dissolved substances an important one is dissolved organic carbon scully and lean 1994 we assume attenuation to be linearly dependent on dissolved organic carbon doc according to lambert beer s law on substances in water 6 k e k d c d o c where c doc is the doc concentration mg l 1 and k d is a proportionality constant l mg 1 m 1 the global nutrient export from watersheds global news model provides estimates of river export of doc for the world harrison et al 2005 mayorga et al 2010 we divide total river doc export over river discharge to obtain basin averaged estimates of river doc concentrations we estimate the values for k l and k d by fitting the experimental data of oocyst survival in different water types under different solar conditions presented by king et al 2008 we used a plot digitizer http arohatgi info webplotdigitizer accessed on 19 april 2017 to obtain the data from the infectivity insolation plots presented in king et al we can substitute eqs 5 and 6 in eq 2 for solar radiation dependent decay temperature and sedimentation were controlled for in the experiment gives 7 ln f s k l i a k d c d o c z 1 e k d c d o c z t king et al controlled for the effect of temperature dependent decay and sedimentation in their experiments we performed an optimization routine on eq 7 minimizing the root mean squared error to find values for k l and k d using the optim function of the stats package in r r development core team 2016 we obtained the following values for the constants k l 0 0004798 and k d 9 831 the model performs quite well in reproducing the observations by king et al fig 2 and the outcome does not seem biased for different water types king et al looked at a combination of raw waters with different doc content pink dots and tap water blue dots we took all of these together to have most data points we performed a linear regression that yielded an adjusted r2 of 0 626 with intercept of 0 66 slope of 0 84 and root mean squared deviation rmsd of 1 58 2 3 3 sedimentation k s k s i the loss due to sedimentation in month i can be modelled following thomann and mueller 1987 8 k s i v z i where v is the settling velocity m day 1 and z i is the river depth m in month i river depth z i is estimated according to section 2 3 4 we take v to be 0 1 m day 1 based on the observations of oocyst settling velocity by brookes et al 2006 and medema et al 1998 the value found by brookes et al 0 1 m day 1 is in between the values by medema et al for settling velocities of free oocysts 0 035 m day 1 and oocysts attached to suspended particles 3 5 m day 1 resuspension of oocysts from sediments is ignored reder et al 2015 apply a similar approach in their continental scale model of faecal bacteria in rivers it should be noted that filtration attachment or straining in permeable sediments could also remove oocysts from water harter et al 2000 however filtration was not included in the model as its contribution to oocyst removal is probably lower than decay and sedimentation and it difficult to estimate as data on the characteristics of streambed sediments are not available at the global scale 2 3 4 river geometry and water residence time we use the river geometry equations by leopold and maddock 1953 to calculate river width depth and mean flow velocity from river discharge the coefficients for these equations were empirically estimated by allen et al 1994 who used data from 674 stations across the usa it was assumed that these coefficients can be applied globally as these stations cover a wide range of hydro climatic zones this approach is taken from van vliet et al 2012 who also applied it for the vic rbm model framework 9 z i 0 34 q i 0 341 10 w i 1 22 q i 0 557 11 u i q i w i z i where z i is river depth m q i is river discharge m3s 1 w i is river width m and u i is river flow velocity m s 1 all in month i the river discharge is naturalized discharge meaning that the existence of dams and reservoirs are not taken into account the length of the river stretch in a grid cell is estimated by taking the distance between its midpoint and the midpoint of the cell it flows towards based on the drainage direction map ddm30 döll and lehner 2002 this was done using the function pointdistance from the raster package in r hijmans 2016 the length of the river stretch divided by the flow velocity gives the residence time of water in a grid cell t i 2 4 oocyst transport with rivers the routing model oocysts are routed through the river channel network based on the global flow direction map ddm30 döll and lehner 2002 which was also used for streamflow routing in vic the routing starts at the grid cells with the lowest flow accumulation i e number of grid cells draining to that grid cell and ends at the grid cells with highest flow accumulation for each grid cell monthly stream inputs from point sp and diffuse sd sources are added to the oocyst load that was already in the stream from the previous grid cell the resulting oocyst load is decreased according to the calculated survival in the grid cell section 2 3 12 l i n s d i s p i l i n 1 e

month 1 in month i 2 5 model performance 2 5 1 validation we validate the model by comparing model outcomes with a set of observational data of cryptosporidium in rivers around the world we have gathered 4000 observations from 346 locations in 11 countries on 5 continents burnet et al 2014 2015 chuah et al 2016 claβen et al 2004 ehsan et al 2015 kistemann et al 2012 lalancette et al 2014 medema et al 2001 rechenburg et al 2009 2006 till et al 2008 the supplementary material s6 provides more information on the sources of the data for each observation we selected the corresponding modelled value from the month and grid cell in which the observation was taken these pairs of observed and predicted values were used for all further analysis it should be noted that the observations are points in time and space while glowpa crypto uses climate and hydrological data averaged by month over a 30 year period on a 0 5 0 5 grid this means that variation in predicted concentrations between months is captured to some degree hydrologically but not the calving or manure spreading season but not between months in different years while of course weather conditions might differ between years similarly within grid spatial variability is not captured by the model oocyst concentrations in surface water are often around or below the detection limit of the most commonly employed methods efstratiou et al 2017 this means that zero values are very common and do not mean absence of the pathogen but a concentration below the detection limit of the method used ongerth 2016 for japan the dataset is incomplete as observed nondetects were not reported personal communication therefore these japanese data are only shown in the figures but excluded for all calculations in our complete data set excluding japan 73 of the observations is below the detection limit ranging from 20 to 95 for the different countries the reported detection limits range from 0 0028 to 1 oocysts l 1 simply ignoring observations below the detection limit in the estimation of for instance descriptive statistics is incorrect as this will lead to overestimation of actual concentrations inserting a value for them such as half of the detection limit as is sometimes done is similarly incorrect haas and scheff 1990 helsel 2010a 2010b therefore we use statistical procedures that can work with these so called censored data by estimating a distribution for values below the detection limit assuming lognormally distributed values helsel 2010b lee and helsel 2005 these are available in the r package nada lee 2017 where possible we correct the observed concentrations for the recovery efficiency a recovery efficiency can be determined by seeding a sample with a known amount of labelled oocysts and determining what percentage of these are recovered by the method efstratiou et al 2017 the actual observed oocyst concentration can then be adjusted accordingly in our data set 28 of the observations reported a recovery efficiency and are adjusted the remainder are used as is three countries reported a recovery efficiency for all observations belgium luxembourg and thailand three for a part of the observations and four did not report a recovery efficiency the recovery efficiency ranged between 0 026 and 0 89 2 5 2 sensitivity analysis we perform a nominal range sensitivity analysis changing one variable at a time based on a reasonable range the variable can take usually both a decrease and an increase are tested a description of the changes to the variables is provided in the supplementary material s7 3 results 3 1 oocyst concentrations worldwide average oocyst concentrations are simulated to fall mostly in the range of 10 6 to 102 oocysts l 1 worldwide table 2 critical regions with high concentrations include densely populated areas in india china pakistan and bangladesh nigeria algeria and south africa mexico venezuela and some coastal areas of brazil several countries in western and eastern europe incl the uk belgium and macedonia and the middle east these hotspot regions align with the hotspot regions observed in the underlying human oocyst loads model glowpa crypto h1 hofstra and vermeulen 2016 more than with the hotspot regions observed in the animal oocyst loads model glowpa crypto l1 vermeulen et al 2017 high values over 103 oocysts l 1 values typically found in untreated sewage nasser 2016 are found in various large cities in developing countries values over 104 oocysts are only found in two grid cells in the month july in bangladesh very low concentrations 10 13 10 6 are found in very sparsely populated areas such as the arctic regions figs 3 and 4 show oocyst concentrations for the months january and july both without and with a discharge mask the masked plots show only large rivers i e grid cells where average annual discharge is higher than 200 m3 s the data presented in figs 3 and 4 are exactly the same the discharge mask is merely a visual aid to better see large rivers only the figures show that for example india parts of china mexico and nigeria are expected to experience higher oocyst concentrations in january than in july grid cells with a monthly average discharge 1 m3 s are excluded from the analysis altogether as the model was found not to perform well for locations with very low discharge the white areas in the plots are thus a result of either discharge below the threshold or no data on oocyst loads it should be noted that oocyst loading from wildlife is ignored in the model globally livestock outnumber wildlife more than 20 to 1 smil 2011 but for some natural areas this might cause an underestimation of oocyst loads a who report on risk assessment of cryptosporidium medema et al 2009 suggests a categorization of source waters for drinking water production in 6 categories 1 very pristine 0 001 oocyst l to 6 grossly polluted 100 oocyst l fig 5 shows what our results look like when these categories are assigned to the modelled concentrations it can be seen that all 6 categories are covered by glowpa crypto c1 meaning that model outputs are in a similar range with what is found in drinking water sources in the supplementary material s5 we present regional concentrations maps for seven world regions africa asia europe latin america middle east north africa mena north america and oceania figs s2 8 we distinguish these regions as our input data for animal oocysts loads make the same distinction furthermore figs s11 13 show oocyst concentrations by month for selected locations for which validation data were available figs 3 and 4 and figures s2 8 and s11 13 show some effect of seasonality but average monthly oocyst concentrations are predicted not to vary more than approximately one log10 unit throughout the year in most places regions with higher variability 2 log10 include parts of india and southeast asia west africa brazil and the west coast of north america 3 2 source attribution glowpa crypto indicates that point sources are the dominant source of oocysts in most world regions fig 6 point sources are human faeces diffuse sources are predominantly livestock manure plus the faeces of the human population that practices open defecation but the latter is only a small part of the total blue regions in fig 6 are grid cells where diffuse sources dominate red regions are grid cells where point sources dominate this map is based on average monthly oocyst stream input variables sd and sp per grid cell 3 3 model performance 3 3 1 validation we compared model outcomes to a set of observational data table s3 and fig s9 give an overview of the data first we should note that in this set of validation data only 28 of observations could be corrected for recovery efficiency mean 0 44 range 0 026 0 89 the remainder we used as is but this means that these observed concentrations are almost certainly too low this problem is also recognized in the literature for instance efstratiou et al 2017 note that most published monitoring data do not specify the recovery efficiency and when specified it can vary widely between 10 and 80 depending on the method the water characteristics such as the turbidity and the person performing the measurement efstratiou et al 2017 for this reason we can expect the modelled concentrations to be higher than the observed concentrations which is indeed the case fig 7 and supplementary material s6 the medians of the predicted concentrations mostly fall within the range of observed concentrations but the model appears to generally produce concentrations that are around 1 5 2 log10 units higher than the observed concentrations fig 7 and supplementary material s6 for the three countries that do have a recovery efficiency for all data belgium luxembourg and thailand observed and modelled concentrations are closer together than for the other countries fig 7 strengthening our notion that correcting for recovery efficiency is important nevertheless other factors likely also contribute to the observed difference between predicted and observed concentrations these could include overestimation of particularly human oocyst excretion rates and underestimation of oocyst losses the glowpa crypto h1 model uses a simple division between the developing and developed world assigning each a single oocyst excretion rate based on the available literature as assessed by hofstra et al 2013 oocyst excretion rates are highly variable and depend on many factors chappell et al 1996 and the model is sensitive to this see section 3 3 2 and vermeulen et al 2015a the model may be underestimating oocyst losses particularly because dams lakes and reservoirs are not yet included increased water travel time will lead to higher modelled oocyst losses due to decay and sedimentation see section 3 3 2 however as the model is much more sensitive to oocyst excretion rates than to losses losses alone could not explain all of the observed difference between observed and predicted oocyst concentrations to assess model performance numerically several goodness of fit statistics were calculated using the log transformed results japan was excluded in these calculations as this data set did not report the nondetects we calculated rank correlation coefficients spearman s rho 0 39 and kendall s tau 0 28 this means there is a moderate positive correlation between observed and predicted values next we applied the index of agreement which compares the sum of the squared error to the potential error willmott et al 1985 a value of 0 indicates no agreement value 1 is best model performance we obtained a value of 0 40 which is an average index and similar to what was found for the worldqual continental faecal indicator model unep 2016 we found a root mean squared error of 1 82 which is quite large as it is a log scale but this is likely a result of the aforementioned differences between predicted and observed oocyst concentrations we also looked at the results for different months but did not find obvious seasonality in observed oocyst concentrations see supplementary material s6 consistent with our finding of limited seasonality in modelled concentrations section 3 1 correlation coefficients computed for the individual countries are worse than for the combined data meaning that the model can reasonably predict differences between locations but does not perform well for predicting variability for a specific location this is probably because variability in oocyst concentrations is inherently high fig 7 shows that the spread in observed concentrations is generally much larger than the spread in modelled concentrations this is not surprising as the model calculates monthly grid cell means and the observations are points in time and space furthermore observations from different years were taken together in the validation set as the amount of data did not justify looking at trends over time and because glowpa crypto uses 30 years average climate and hydrological data as input 3 3 2 sensitivity analysis the model is most sensitive to changes in input human oocyst loads table s4 in the supplementary material and to a lesser extent to input animal loads as human loads were found to dominate in most places to a lesser extent the model was sensitive to oocyst retention river length and water residence time in a grid cell these affect the time during which decay and sedimentation take place we performed a low end and high end run combining changes in all parameters to investigate the combined effect on model output see description in supplementary material s7 the high and low end runs cause a 1 5 log10 change in median concentration in either direction this 3 log difference yields very different who category maps of the low end and high end runs fig 8 while in the low end run the majority of the grid cells around the world falls in categories 1 3 very pristine pristine and moderately polluted in the high end run categories 4 6 polluted heavily polluted and grossly polluted are most dominant furthermore the low end run shows that even at the most optimistic end of model assumptions there are some regions that come out as highly polluted in any case when comparing the difference between the high and low end run spatially several points come to the attention 1 the absolute difference between the high and low end runs high minus low is largest in areas where concentrations are highest which are generally areas dominated by human sources 2 the relative difference between the high and low end runs high divided by low is largest in the areas where the diffuse sources dominate see fig 6 which means the diffuse sources are relatively more uncertain especially the fraction of oocysts in manure that is transported with runoff to surface water but compared with the magnitude of the human sources this does not matter so much and 3 the large rivers stand out meaning that the uncertainty accumulates with the routing which is a logical consequence of the way the model is constructed 4 discussion models of faecal microorganisms in rivers exist mostly at the catchment scale vermeulen et al 2015b most commonly catchment scale waterborne pathogen models couple a pathogen loading estimate to an existing hydrological model we are only aware of one other large scale concentrations model worldqual which has been applied for faecal coliform bacteria for several continents reder et al 2015 unep 2016 faecal coliforms are indicators of faecal pollution but not pathogenic themselves for other water quality variables such as nutrients large scale modelling is much more advanced vermeulen et al 2015b therefore the development of glowpa crypto provides important new opportunities such as estimating hotspot regions with high concentrations section 3 1 and assessing source attribution section 3 2 another interesting application would be to use glowpa crypto for scenario analysis global change processes such as population growth socioeconomic development and climate changes may influence pathogen concentrations in surface water in future e g fearnley et al 2010 hofstra 2011 schijven and de roda husman 2005 the high concentrations in urban areas in developing countries are a concern and the situation in these regions is expected to get worse in the future due to high population growth and installing sewer connections without sewage treatment keeping up hofstra and vermeulen 2016 climatic changes potentially affect the runoff from land transport with rivers and temperature dependent oocyst decay however the current model predicts limited effects of seasonal variation in these climatic variables on monthly average concentrations section 3 1 yet this is merely the variability in monthly average concentrations which does not say anything about variability at shorter time steps many studies find that oocyst concentrations can respond strongly to peak runoff events atherholt et al 1998 kistemann et al 2002 and may reach much higher levels than indicated by our model for short time periods furthermore glowpa crypto operates under the assumption that manure is applied equally in all months which is probably not actually the case in most cropping systems more detailed input data for example on manure application worldwide would be needed to operate glowpa crypto on a finer temporal resolution glowpa crypto should be used to look at the bigger picture and not to make statements about actual levels of contamination in specific locations at specific times such big picture approaches are essential to address large scale transboundary issues like water pollution for instance in the context of the sustainable development goals that the world aims to reach in 2030 united nations general assembly 2015 goal 6 is to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all large scale water quality models such as glowpa crypto could be a tool help assess progress and identify policy options to reach this goal it should be noted that glowpa crypto l1 includes all cryptosporidium spp also those that are not infectious for humans vermeulen et al 2017 this means that the risk of contracting cryptosporidiosis from animal or human sources is not equal and these maps should not be used for assessing risk directly dominance of point sources of microbial pollution over diffuse sources of is also found in several other studies for example in the scheldt river for e coli ouattara et al 2013 and the european faecal coliform model reder et al 2015 however diffuse sources were found to dominate in a study on faecal indicators in vietnam nguyen et al 2016 and it is also observed that dominance can vary for different organisms and under epidemic conditions in sweden sokolova et al 2012 performing a thorough systematic literature inventory for prevalence of cryptosporidium infection and oocyst concentrations in human faeces similar to what we have done for livestock manure vermeulen et al 2017 was out of the scope of this study however in light of the model validation and sensitivity analysis this should be given priority in further research oocyst excretion rates are variable and uncertain even between infected individuals oocyst production can differ strongly chappell et al 1996 vermeulen et al 2017 other models of pathogens or faecal indicators have similarly observed sensitivity to pathogen loading from humans and animals coffey et al 2010 ferguson et al 2007 reder et al 2017 tian et al 2002 we recommend that monitoring programs for cryptosporidium in rivers should always determine and report the recovery efficiency preferably for each individual sample in order for data to be useful for quantitative analysis and model validation efstratiou et al 2017 ongerth 2016 important potential model improvements that we envision are 1 refining human oocyst load input by the h1 model by thoroughly analysing the literature on human oocyst excretion rates 2 refining oocyst load input by the l1 model for instance by incorporating monthly variation in manure input to the land through including manure spreading regimes and birthing seasons 3 including dams lakes and reservoirs instead of working with naturalized discharge and related to this improving estimates of river flow path length and water residence times and 4 refining the calculation of oocyst retention on land it should be noted that more data should become available in order to be able to implement these improvements effectively particularly number 2 and 4 opportunities for glowpa crypto c1 include that the model could be applied in scenario analysis to investigate the impact of global change and management options on oocyst concentrations in rivers furthermore the model could serve as a basis for risk assessment studies to assess human health impacts if the output were to be used as input for quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra a first exploration of this application has already been done vermeulen 2018 especially for application in risk assessment it would be interesting to look into the option to make glowpa crypto c1 a stochastic model so that instead of calculating monthly average concentrations it would provide output concentration distributions furthermore studying model output for the different continents in more detail would be interesting glowpa crypto c1 could also be downscaled to operate for a specific region with more detailed input data 5 conclusion glowpa crypto c1 is the first global model that computes pathogen concentrations in rivers modelling the transport of cryptosporidium through the environment is a helpful tool to get insight in the predicted order of magnitude of oocyst concentrations worldwide to pinpoint hotspot regions of high concentrations that can be interesting places to focus further study on and to gain insight in the relative importance of different pollution sources main findings from this study are monthly average oocyst concentrations are predicted to range from 10 6 to 102 oocysts l 1 in most places hotspot regions with high concentrations include parts of india china pakistan and bangladesh nigeria algeria and south africa mexico venezuela and some coastal areas of brazil several countries in western and eastern europe incl the uk belgium and macedonia and the middle east point sources human faeces appears to be a more dominant source of pollution than diffuse sources animal manure in most world regions glowpa crypto c1 paves the way for many new opportunities at the global scale including scenario

19146,cryptosporidium is a leading cause of diarrhoea and infant mortality worldwide a better understanding of the sources fate and transport of cryptosporidium via rivers is important for effective management of waterborne transmission especially in the developing world we present glowpa crypto c1 the first global spatially explicit model that computes cryptosporidium concentrations in rivers implemented on a 0 5 0 5 grid and monthly time step to this end we first modelled cryptosporidium inputs to rivers from human faeces and animal manure next we use modelled hydrology from a grid based macroscale hydrological model the variable infiltration capacity model oocyst transport through the river network is modelled using a routing model accounting for temperature and solar radiation dependent decay and sedimentation along the way monthly average oocyst concentrations are predicted to range from 10 6 to 102 oocysts l 1 in most places critical regions hotspots with high concentrations include densely populated areas in india china pakistan and bangladesh nigeria algeria and south africa mexico venezuela and some coastal areas of brazil several countries in western and eastern europe incl the uk belgium and macedonia and the middle east point sources human faeces appears to be a more dominant source of pollution than diffuse sources mainly animal manure in most world regions validation shows that glowpa crypto medians are mostly within the range of observed concentrations the model generally produces concentrations that are 1 5 2 log10 higher than the observations this is likely predominantly due to the absence of recovery efficiency of the observations which are therefore likely too low goodness of fit statistics are reasonable sensitivity analysis showed that the model is most sensitive to changes in input oocyst loads glowpa crypto c1 paves the way for many new opportunities at the global scale including scenario analysis to investigate the impact of global change and management options on oocysts concentrations in rivers and risk analysis to investigate human health risk graphical abstract image 1 keywords pathogens water quality model transport surface water global 1 introduction diarrhoea is still a major cause of death worldwide especially in children younger than 5 years in developing countries gbd 2013 mortality and causes of death collaborators 2015 the zoonotic protozoan parasite cryptosporidium that is transmitted via the faecal oral route is an important cause of childhood diarrhoea and mortality liu et al 2016 infection can occur via direct contact with faeces of infected humans or animals zambrano et al 2014 but also often occurs via a waterborne route through the environment examples are drinking of river water or recreation in rivers contaminated with faeces shirley et al 2012 and consumption of fresh produce irrigated with contaminated water dixon 2016 oocysts the robust survival stage of the pathogen are excreted in faeces of infected humans and animals and can reach rivers either directly point sources such as sewer pipes or indirectly diffuse sources such as manure transported with surface runoff oocysts are transported with rivers and meanwhile decay and sedimentation decrease their viability and concentration gaining insight in the transmission of cryptosporidium via rivers is important for evaluating disease risk insight in the relative contribution of human versus animal sources point versus diffuse sources and pathways and effect of control measures are important to design effective management strategies but as sampling of cryptosporidium and other pathogen concentrations is expensive and laborious observational data are scarce especially for the developing world modelling is a common approach to increase insight for example by pinpointing hotspots of high concentrations or identifying the relative importance of pollutant sources in this study we aim to estimate cryptosporidium oocyst concentrations in rivers worldwide we present the model glowpa crypto c1 the global waterborne pathogen model for cryptosporidium concentrations version 1 a global spatially explicit model that calculates mean monthly oocyst concentrations in rivers 2 materials and methods glowpa crypto c1 couples the output from the loading

assess model performance fig 1 gives a schematic model representation all calculations are performed on a 0 5 0 5 grid and monthly time step using the software environment r r development core team 2016 we use the most recent available estimates for all input variables and we consider the model representative for approximately the conditions around the years 2005 2010 table s1 in the supplementary materials list the variables that are included in the model 2 1 sources of cryptosporidium 2 1 1 human sources human cryptosporidium loads to rivers are calculated in the glowpa crypto h1 model hofstra and vermeulen 2016 in brief glowpa crypto h1 calculates oocyst loads by multiplying human population data with estimates of cryptosporidium infection associated oocyst excretion and removal depending on the sanitation system used prevalence of cryptosporidium infection and oocyst excretion in humans are estimated from literature and gridded data of human population from landscan bright et al 2011 are divided in developed developing and urban rural depending on the sanitation systems used by the different populations from the who jmp joint monitoring program and assumptions on the removal of oocysts by sewage treatment the final load to rivers is calculated the model is programmed in r and operates on a 0 5 0 5 grid for the world at an annual time step and is representative for conditions in approximately the year 2010 the annual oocyst loads are divided by 12 as an estimate of monthly oocyst loads 2 1 2 animal sources animal cryptosporidium loads to land are calculated in the glowpa crypto l1 model vermeulen et al 2017 in brief livestock population data are from the gridded livestock of the world v2 0 robinson et al 2014 and prevalence and oocyst excretion by 11 livestock species cattle buffaloes pigs sheep goats horses camels donkeys mules chickens and ducks are based on an extensive literature review vermeulen et al 2017 the model differentiates between manure excreted directly on land during grazing and manure spread on land after storage and temperature dependent oocyst decay during storage is accounted for the model is programmed in r and operates on a 0 5 0 5 grid for the world at an annual time step and is representative for conditions in approximately the year 2005 the annual oocyst loads are divided by 12 as an estimate of monthly oocyst loads this means that the timing of the birthing season and application of stored manure on fields is not accounted for in the current version of the model as comprehensive global data on this are not available 2 2 oocyst transport from land to rivers transport of oocysts from the land to rivers largely depends on surface runoff as subsurface flow will generally transport few oocysts due to the filtering capacity of soils mawdsley et al 1996 mclaughlin et al 2013 in hofstra and vermeulen 2016 the load from the population that practices open defecation in rural areas a diffuse source was multiplied with a constant runoff fraction 0 025 to estimate the amount ending up in rivers using a constant runoff fraction does not account for the variability in runoff and associated transport therefore in glowpa crypto c1 we no longer use this constant runoff fraction but instead make oocyst transport from land to rivers dependent on surface runoff both for human diffuse sources and animal sources the vic model liang et al 1994 provides data of surface runoff mm day 1 and discharge m3 s 1 surface runoff and discharge are monthly mean averages of a baseline vic run with watch forcing data weedon et al 2011 averaged over the period 1970 2000 0 5 0 5 grid given a certain surface runoff we need to estimate the fraction of oocysts that is transported to rivers surface runoff will not transport all oocysts from manure to rivers a large part of the oocyst load will be retained within the faecal matrix or on the soil surface table 1 leading to a reduction of several log units of the oocyst load that will reach the river we found 9 studies that quantify the amount of oocysts that are transported with runoff from faecal deposits on land only one of which measured this under field conditions table 1 from table 1 we can see that both the faecal matrix and soils contribute to reducing the oocyst load in runoff and that vegetated soils do so more effectively than bare soils under field conditions larger retention is observed than under simulated rainfall which is likely partly due to decay as atwill et al 2006 measured oocysts in runoff over a period of one year during this year surface runoff varied from 0 to 20 mm we therefore choose to linearly assign the observed log oocyst retention from vegetated plots under field conditions 3 2 8 8 log10 to grid cells with runoff values ranging between 0 and 20 mm where highest runoff will get lowest retention and vice versa this approach is extrapolated and grid cells with higher runoff get assigned a retention between 1 and 3 2 log10 we assume that under field conditions at least 1 log10 oocysts is retained due to decay and landscape characteristics in months that surface runoff is zero oocyst retention is set to infinite oocyst stream input from diffuse sources sd is calculated by decreasing the animal oocyst loads on land as calculated with glowpa crypto l1 and the human diffuse oocyst loads as calculated with glowpa crypto h1 with the assigned retention the oocyst stream input from point sources sp is the total human load to rivers as calculated in glowpa crypto h1 minus the human diffuse sources modelling the release of cryptosporidium from manure to rivers is challenging given the scarcity of observational data we have also looked into the literature on existing modelling approaches and conclude there currently is no single gold standard approach to modelling the release of oocysts from manure and transport to rivers furthermore existing modelling approaches require too detailed input data in space and or time to directly apply them at a global scale on a monthly time step see supplementary material s2 for a more detailed discussion although crude the approach we have chosen accounts for spatial and monthly variability in surface runoff and the magnitude of retention is based on observations under field conditions atwill et al 2006 more experimental data on oocyst release from manure and transport to rivers under various climatic and landscape conditions is needed to refine this approach 2 3 oocyst survival during transport with rivers oocyst survival during transport can be modelled following standard first order decay 1 c t c 0 e k t where c t is the oocyst concentration after time t days c 0 is the initial concentration and k is the loss rate coefficient day 1 writing this in a different way the natural logarithm of the fraction that survives in month i fs i equals 2 ln f s i k i t i the loss rate coefficient k i day 1 can have several components thomann and mueller 1987 3 k i k t i k r i k s i k t i is the temperature dependent decay rate day 1 k r i is the solar radiation dependent decay rate day 1 and k s i is the loss rate due to sedimentation day 1 in month i see sections 2 3 1 2 3 3 water residence time in a grid cell t i is estimated as described in section 2 3 4 the supplementary material s4 contains some maps of the different loss components it is important to note that decay and sedimentation have partially different effects on the oocysts sedimentation has an effect on the concentration in the water phase directly while decay has an effect on the viability and infectivity of oocysts loss of viability and infectivity may lead to disintegration thereby reducing the concentration 2 3 1 temperature dependent survival kt to calculate temperature dependent survival during transport with rivers we use the approach by peng et al 2008 who compiled literature estimates on the survival of cryptosporidium in raw waters we apply the following relationship between k t and water temperature t w 4 k t i k 4 e λ t w i 4 where k 4 and k t i are respectively the decay rate coefficients day 1 at 4 c and water temperature t w i in month i and λ is a dimensionless constant for t w we use monthly mean water temperature as estimated by the vic rbm model framework which was applied globally van vliet et al 2012 this is a coupled hydrological water temperature model framework based on the vic model liang et al 1994 and rbm stream temperature model yearsley 2009 monthly mean water temperature is calculated as a 24 h mean extended to 30 days for k 4 and λ we take the values reported for cell culture studies in raw waters by peng et al these are k 4 0 0051 day 1 and λ 0 158 peng et al 2008 in their review peng et al distinguished between studies reporting cryptosporidium survival for dapi pi or excystation studies and studies that used cell culture to measure oocyst infectivity for water temperatures between 4 and 20 c observed k values were similar but for temperatures over 25 c k values from cell culture studies were notably higher peng et al 2008 meaning that in the high temperature range dapi pi and excystation studies likely overestimate the survival of infectious oocysts therefore we take the values reported for cell culture studies for waters below 4 c few studies have been done peng et al 2008 we therefore assume that survival in waters below 4 c is the same as at 4 c other models of cryptosporidium in rivers use similar k values for temperature dependent decay see supplementary material s3 2 3 2 solar radiation dependent survival k r for k r we can follow mancini 1978 and thomann and mueller 1987 to calculate water depth averaged solar radiation dependent decay 5 k r i k l i a i k e z i 1 e k e z i where i a i is the average surface solar radiation kj m 2 day 1 in month i k l is a proportionality constant m2 kj 1 k e is the attenuation coefficient m 1 and z i is the water depth m in month i surface solar radiation data are from the watch forcing data weedon et al 2011 the ultraviolet uv part of solar radiation is most important in decreasing oocyst infectivity connelly et al 2007 attenuation of uv radiation in water is influenced by dissolved substances an important one is dissolved organic carbon scully and lean 1994 we assume attenuation to be linearly dependent on dissolved organic carbon doc according to lambert beer s law on substances in water 6 k e k d c d o c where c doc is the doc concentration mg l 1 and k d is a proportionality constant l mg 1 m 1 the global nutrient export from watersheds global news model provides estimates of river export of doc for the world harrison et al 2005 mayorga et al 2010 we divide total river doc export over river discharge to obtain basin averaged estimates of river doc concentrations we estimate the values for k l and k d by fitting the experimental data of oocyst survival in different water types under different solar conditions presented by king et al 2008 we used a plot digitizer http arohatgi info webplotdigitizer accessed on 19 april 2017 to obtain the data from the infectivity insolation plots presented in king et al we can substitute eqs 5 and 6 in eq 2 for solar radiation dependent decay temperature and sedimentation were controlled for in the experiment gives 7 ln f s k l i a k d c d o c z 1 e k d c d o c z t king et al controlled for the effect of temperature dependent decay and sedimentation in their experiments we performed an optimization routine on eq 7 minimizing the root mean squared error to find values for k l and k d using the optim function of the stats package in r r development core team 2016 we obtained the following values for the constants k l 0 0004798 and k d 9 831 the model performs quite well in reproducing the observations by king et al fig 2 and the outcome does not seem biased for different water types king et al looked at a combination of raw waters with different doc content pink dots and tap water blue dots we took all of these together to have most data points we performed a linear regression that yielded an adjusted r2 of 0 626 with intercept of 0 66 slope of 0 84 and root mean squared deviation rmsd of 1 58 2 3 3 sedimentation k s k s i the loss due to sedimentation in month i can be modelled following thomann and mueller 1987 8 k s i v z i where v is the settling velocity m day 1 and z i is the river depth m in month i river depth z i is estimated according to section 2 3 4 we take v to be 0 1 m day 1 based on the observations of oocyst settling velocity by brookes et al 2006 and medema et al 1998 the value found by brookes et al 0 1 m day 1 is in between the values by medema et al for settling velocities of free oocysts 0 035 m day 1 and oocysts attached to suspended particles 3 5 m day 1 resuspension of oocysts from sediments is ignored reder et al 2015 apply a similar approach in their continental scale model of faecal bacteria in rivers it should be noted that filtration attachment or straining in permeable sediments could also remove oocysts from water harter et al 2000 however filtration was not included in the model as its contribution to oocyst removal is probably lower than decay and sedimentation and it difficult to estimate as data on the characteristics of streambed sediments are not available at the global scale 2 3 4 river geometry and water residence time we use the river geometry equations by leopold and maddock 1953 to calculate river width depth and mean flow velocity from river discharge the coefficients for these equations were empirically estimated by allen et al 1994 who used data from 674 stations across the usa it was assumed that these coefficients can be applied globally as these stations cover a wide range of hydro climatic zones this approach is taken from van vliet et al 2012 who also applied it for the vic rbm model framework 9 z i 0 34 q i 0 341 10 w i 1 22 q i 0 557 11 u i q i w i z i where z i is river depth m q i is river discharge m3s 1 w i is river width m and u i is river flow velocity m s 1 all in month i the river discharge is naturalized discharge meaning that the existence of dams and reservoirs are not taken into account the length of the river stretch in a grid cell is estimated by taking the distance between its midpoint and the midpoint of the cell it flows towards based on the drainage direction map ddm30 döll and lehner 2002 this was done using the function pointdistance from the raster package in r hijmans 2016 the length of the river stretch divided by the flow velocity gives the residence time of water in a grid cell t i 2 4 oocyst transport with rivers the routing model oocysts are routed through the river channel network based on the global flow direction map ddm30 döll and lehner 2002 which was also used for streamflow routing in vic the routing starts at the grid cells with the lowest flow accumulation i e number of grid cells draining to that grid cell and ends at the grid cells with highest flow accumulation for each grid cell monthly stream inputs from point sp and diffuse sd sources are added to the oocyst load that was already in the stream from the previous grid cell the resulting oocyst load is decreased according to the calculated survival in the grid cell section 2 3 12 l i n s d i s p i l i n 1 e

month 1 in month i 2 5 model performance 2 5 1 validation we validate the model by comparing model outcomes with a set of observational data of cryptosporidium in rivers around the world we have gathered 4000 observations from 346 locations in 11 countries on 5 continents burnet et al 2014 2015 chuah et al 2016 claβen et al 2004 ehsan et al 2015 kistemann et al 2012 lalancette et al 2014

modelled value from the month and grid cell in which the observation was taken these pairs of observed and predicted values were used for all further analysis it should be noted that the observations are points in time and space while glowpa crypto uses climate and hydrological data averaged by month over a 30 year period on a 0 5 0 5 grid this means that variation in predicted concentrations between months is captured to some degree hydrologically but not the calving or manure spreading season but not between months in different years while of course weather conditions might differ between years similarly within grid spatial variability is not captured by the model oocyst concentrations in surface water are often around or below the detection limit of the most commonly employed methods efstratiou et al 2017 this means that zero values are very common and do not mean absence of the pathogen but a concentration below the detection limit of the method used ongerth 2016 for japan the dataset is incomplete as observed nondetects were not reported personal communication therefore these japanese data are only shown in the figures but excluded for all calculations in our complete data set excluding japan 73 of the observations is below the detection limit ranging from 20 to 95 for the different countries the reported detection limits range from 0 0028 to 1 oocysts l 1 simply ignoring observations below the detection limit in the estimation of for instance descriptive statistics is incorrect as this will lead to overestimation of actual concentrations inserting a value for them such as half of the detection limit as is sometimes done is similarly incorrect haas and scheff 1990 helsel 2010a 2010b therefore we use statistical procedures that can work with these so called censored data by estimating a distribution for values below the detection limit assuming lognormally distributed values helsel 2010b lee and helsel 2005 these are available in the r package nada lee 2017 where possible we correct the observed concentrations for the recovery efficiency a recovery efficiency can be determined by seeding a sample with a known amount of labelled oocysts and determining what percentage of these are recovered by the method efstratiou et al 2017 the actual observed oocyst concentration can then be adjusted accordingly in our data set 28 of the observations reported a recovery efficiency and are adjusted the remainder are used as is three countries reported a recovery efficiency for all observations belgium luxembourg and thailand three for a part of the observations and four did not report a recovery efficiency the recovery efficiency ranged between 0 026 and 0 89 2 5 2 sensitivity analysis we perform a nominal range sensitivity analysis changing one variable at a time based on a reasonable range the variable can take usually both a decrease and an increase are tested a description of the changes to the variables is provided in the supplementary material s7 3 results 3 1 oocyst concentrations worldwide average oocyst concentrations are simulated to fall mostly in the range of 10 6 to 102 oocysts l 1 worldwide table 2 critical regions with high concentrations include densely populated areas in india china pakistan and bangladesh nigeria algeria and south africa mexico venezuela and some coastal areas of brazil several countries in western and eastern europe incl the uk belgium and macedonia and the middle east these hotspot regions align with the hotspot regions observed in the underlying human oocyst loads model glowpa crypto h1 hofstra and vermeulen 2016 more than with the hotspot regions observed in the animal oocyst loads model glowpa crypto l1 vermeulen et al 2017 high values over 103 oocysts l 1 values typically found in untreated sewage nasser 2016 are found in various large cities in developing countries values over 104 oocysts are only found in two grid cells in the month july in bangladesh very low concentrations 10 13 10 6 are found in very sparsely populated areas such as the arctic regions figs 3 and 4 show oocyst concentrations for the months january and july both without and with a discharge mask the masked plots show only large rivers i e grid cells where average annual discharge is higher than 200 m3 s the data presented in figs 3 and 4 are exactly the same the discharge mask is merely a visual aid to better see large rivers only the figures show that for example india parts of china mexico and nigeria are expected to experience higher oocyst concentrations in january than in july grid cells with a monthly average discharge 1 m3 s are excluded from the analysis altogether as the model was found not to perform well for locations with very low discharge the white areas in the plots are thus a result of either discharge below the threshold or no data on oocyst loads it should be noted that oocyst loading from wildlife is ignored in the model globally livestock outnumber wildlife more than 20 to 1 smil 2011 but for some natural areas this might cause an underestimation of oocyst loads a who report on risk assessment of cryptosporidium medema et al 2009 suggests a categorization of source waters for drinking water production in 6 categories 1 very pristine 0 001 oocyst l to 6 grossly polluted 100 oocyst l fig 5 shows what our results look like when these categories are assigned to the modelled concentrations it can be seen that all 6 categories are covered by glowpa crypto c1 meaning that model outputs are in a similar range with what is found in drinking water sources in the supplementary material s5 we present regional concentrations maps for seven world regions africa asia europe latin america middle east north africa mena north america and oceania figs s2 8 we distinguish these regions as our input data for animal oocysts loads make the same distinction furthermore figs s11 13 show oocyst concentrations by month for selected locations for which validation data were available figs 3 and 4 and figures s2 8 and s11 13 show some effect of seasonality but average monthly oocyst concentrations are predicted not to vary more than approximately one log10 unit throughout the year in most places regions with higher variability 2 log10 include parts of india and southeast asia west africa brazil and the west coast of north america 3 2 source attribution glowpa crypto indicates that point sources are the dominant source of oocysts in most world regions fig 6 point sources are human faeces diffuse sources are predominantly livestock manure plus the faeces of the human population that practices open defecation but the latter is only a small part of the total blue regions in fig 6 are grid cells where diffuse sources dominate red regions are grid cells where point sources dominate this map is based on average monthly oocyst stream input variables sd and sp per grid cell 3 3 model performance 3 3 1 validation we compared model outcomes to a set of observational data table s3 and fig s9 give an overview of the data first we should note that in this set of validation data only 28 of observations could be corrected for recovery efficiency mean 0 44 range 0 026 0 89 the remainder we used as is but this means that these observed concentrations are almost certainly too low this problem is also recognized in the literature for instance efstratiou et al 2017 note that most published monitoring data do not specify the recovery efficiency and when specified it can vary widely between 10 and 80 depending on the method the water characteristics such as the turbidity and the person performing the measurement efstratiou et al 2017 for this reason we can expect the modelled concentrations to be higher than the observed concentrations which is indeed the case fig 7 and supplementary material s6 the medians of the predicted concentrations mostly fall within the range of observed concentrations but the model appears to generally produce concentrations that are around 1 5 2 log10 units higher than the observed concentrations fig 7 and supplementary material s6 for the three countries that do have a recovery efficiency for all data belgium luxembourg and thailand observed and modelled concentrations are closer together than for the other countries fig 7 strengthening our notion that correcting for recovery efficiency is important nevertheless other factors likely also contribute to the observed difference between predicted and observed concentrations these could include overestimation of particularly human oocyst excretion rates and underestimation of oocyst losses the glowpa crypto h1 model uses a simple division between the developing and developed world assigning each a single oocyst excretion rate based on the available literature as assessed by hofstra et al 2013 oocyst excretion rates are highly variable and depend on many factors chappell et al 1996 and the model is sensitive to this see section 3 3 2 and vermeulen et al 2015a the model may be underestimating oocyst losses particularly because dams lakes and reservoirs are not yet included increased water travel time will lead to higher modelled oocyst losses due to decay and sedimentation see section 3 3 2 however as the model is much more sensitive to oocyst excretion rates than to losses losses alone could not explain all of the observed difference between observed and predicted oocyst concentrations to assess model performance numerically several goodness of fit statistics were calculated using the log transformed results japan was excluded in these calculations as this data set did not report the nondetects we calculated rank correlation coefficients spearman s rho 0 39 and kendall s tau 0 28 this means there is a moderate positive correlation between observed and predicted values next we applied the index of agreement which compares the sum of the squared error to the potential error willmott et al 1985 a value of 0 indicates no agreement value 1 is best model performance we obtained a value of 0 40 which is an average index and similar to what was found for the worldqual continental faecal indicator model unep 2016 we found a root mean squared error of 1 82 which is quite large as it is a log scale but this is likely a result of the aforementioned differences between predicted and observed oocyst concentrations we also looked at the results for different months but did not find obvious seasonality in observed oocyst concentrations see supplementary material s6 consistent with our finding of limited seasonality in modelled concentrations section 3 1 correlation coefficients computed for the individual countries are worse than for the combined data meaning that the model can reasonably predict differences between locations but does not perform well for predicting variability for a specific location this is probably because variability in oocyst concentrations is inherently high fig 7 shows that the spread in observed concentrations is generally much larger than the spread in modelled concentrations this is not surprising as the model calculates monthly grid cell means and the observations are points in time and space furthermore observations from different years were taken together in the validation set as the amount of data did not justify looking at trends over time and because glowpa crypto uses 30 years average climate and hydrological data as input 3 3 2 sensitivity analysis the model is most sensitive to changes in input human oocyst loads table s4 in the supplementary material and to a lesser extent to input animal loads as human loads were found to dominate in most places to a lesser extent the model was sensitive to oocyst retention river length and water residence time in a grid cell these affect the time during which decay and sedimentation take place we performed a low end and high end run combining changes in all parameters to investigate the combined effect on model output see description in supplementary material s7 the high and low end runs cause a 1 5 log10 change in median concentration in either direction this 3 log difference yields very different who category maps of the low end and high end runs fig 8 while in the low end run the majority of the grid cells around the world falls in categories 1 3 very pristine pristine and moderately polluted in the high end run categories 4 6 polluted heavily polluted and grossly polluted are most dominant furthermore the low end run shows that even at the most optimistic end of model assumptions there are some regions that come out as highly polluted in any case when comparing the difference between the high and low end run spatially several points come to the attention 1 the absolute difference between the high and low end runs high minus low is largest in areas where concentrations are highest which are generally areas dominated by human sources 2 the relative difference between the high and low end runs high divided by low is largest in the areas where the diffuse sources dominate see fig 6 which means the diffuse sources are relatively more uncertain especially the fraction of oocysts in manure that is transported with runoff to surface water but compared with the magnitude of the human sources this does not matter so much and 3 the large rivers stand out meaning that the uncertainty accumulates with the routing which is a logical consequence of the way the model is constructed 4 discussion models of faecal microorganisms in rivers exist mostly at the catchment scale vermeulen et al 2015b most commonly catchment scale waterborne pathogen models couple a pathogen loading estimate to an existing hydrological model we are only aware of one other large scale concentrations model worldqual which has been applied for faecal coliform bacteria for several continents reder et al 2015 unep 2016 faecal coliforms are indicators of faecal pollution but not pathogenic themselves for other water quality variables such as nutrients large scale modelling is much more advanced vermeulen et al 2015b therefore the development of glowpa crypto provides important new opportunities such as estimating hotspot regions with high concentrations section 3 1 and assessing source attribution section 3 2 another interesting application would be to use glowpa crypto for scenario analysis global change processes such as population growth socioeconomic development and climate changes may influence pathogen concentrations in surface water in future e g fearnley et al 2010 hofstra 2011 schijven and de roda husman 2005 the high concentrations in urban areas in developing countries are a concern and the situation in these regions is expected to get worse in the future due to high population growth and installing sewer connections without sewage treatment keeping up hofstra and vermeulen 2016 climatic changes potentially affect the runoff from land transport with rivers and temperature dependent oocyst decay however the current model predicts limited effects of seasonal variation in these climatic variables on monthly average concentrations section 3 1 yet this is merely the variability in monthly average concentrations which does not say anything about variability at shorter time steps many studies find that oocyst concentrations can respond strongly to peak runoff events atherholt et al 1998 kistemann et al 2002 and may reach much higher levels than indicated by our model for short time periods furthermore glowpa crypto operates under the assumption that manure is applied equally in all months which is probably not actually the case in most cropping systems more detailed input data for example on manure application worldwide would be needed to operate glowpa crypto on a finer temporal resolution glowpa crypto should be used to look at the bigger picture and not to make statements about actual levels of contamination in specific locations at specific times such big picture approaches are essential to address large scale transboundary issues like water pollution for instance in the context of the sustainable development goals that the world aims to reach in 2030 united nations general assembly 2015 goal 6 is to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all large scale water quality models such as glowpa crypto could be a tool help assess progress and identify policy options to reach this goal it should be noted that glowpa crypto l1 includes all cryptosporidium spp also those that are not infectious for humans vermeulen et al 2017 this means that the risk of contracting cryptosporidiosis from animal or human sources is not equal and these maps should not be used for assessing risk directly dominance of point sources of microbial pollution over diffuse sources of is also found in several other studies for example in the scheldt river for e coli ouattara et al 2013 and the european faecal coliform model reder et al 2015 however diffuse sources were found to dominate in a study on faecal indicators in vietnam nguyen et al 2016 and it is also observed that dominance can vary for different organisms and under epidemic conditions in sweden sokolova et al 2012 performing a thorough systematic literature inventory for prevalence of cryptosporidium infection and oocyst concentrations in human faeces similar to what we have done for livestock manure vermeulen et al 2017 was out of the scope of this study however in light of the model validation and sensitivity analysis this should be given priority in further research oocyst excretion rates are variable and uncertain even between infected individuals oocyst production can differ strongly chappell et al 1996 vermeulen et al 2017 other models of pathogens or faecal indicators have similarly observed sensitivity to pathogen loading from humans and animals coffey et al 2010 ferguson et al 2007 reder et al 2017 tian et al 2002 we recommend that monitoring programs for cryptosporidium in rivers should always determine and report the recovery efficiency preferably for each individual sample in order for data to be useful for quantitative analysis and model validation efstratiou et al 2017 ongerth 2016 important potential model improvements that we envision are 1 refining human oocyst load input by the h1 model by thoroughly analysing the literature on human oocyst excretion rates 2 refining oocyst load input by the l1 model for instance by incorporating monthly variation in manure input to the land through including manure spreading regimes and birthing seasons 3 including dams lakes and reservoirs instead of working with naturalized discharge and related to this improving estimates of river flow path length and water residence times and 4 refining the calculation of oocyst retention on land it should be noted that more data should become available in order to be able to implement these improvements effectively particularly number 2 and 4 opportunities for glowpa crypto c1 include that the model could be applied in scenario analysis to investigate the impact of global change and management options on oocyst concentrations in rivers furthermore the model could serve as a basis for risk assessment studies to assess human health impacts if the output were to be used as input for quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra a first exploration of this application has already been done vermeulen 2018 especially for application in risk assessment it would be interesting to look into the option to make glowpa crypto c1 a stochastic model so that instead of calculating monthly average concentrations it would provide output concentration distributions furthermore studying model output for the different continents in more detail would be interesting glowpa crypto c1 could also be downscaled to operate for a specific region with more detailed input data 5 conclusion glowpa crypto c1 is the first global model that computes pathogen concentrations in rivers modelling the transport of cryptosporidium through the environment is a helpful tool to get insight in the predicted order of magnitude of oocyst concentrations worldwide to pinpoint hotspot regions of high concentrations that can be interesting places to focus further study on and to gain insight in the relative importance of different pollution sources main findings from this study are monthly average oocyst concentrations are predicted to range from 10 6 to 102 oocysts l 1 in most places hotspot regions with high concentrations include parts of india china pakistan and bangladesh nigeria algeria and south africa mexico venezuela and some coastal areas of brazil several countries in western and eastern europe incl the uk belgium and macedonia and the middle east point sources human faeces appears to be a more dominant source of pollution than diffuse sources animal manure in most world regions glowpa crypto c1 paves the way for many new opportunities at the global scale including scenario analysis to investigate the impact of global change and management options on oocysts concentrations in rivers and risk analysis to investigate human health risk acknowledgements lucie vermeulen was

19147,in this study a novel manner of bio electric field bef which generated by upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb microbial fuel cell mfc integrated system facilitated iron carbon micro electrolysis in blast furnace dusting ash bfda was proposed for the reinforcement of anaerobic digestion in uasb the responses of cod removal efficiency and biogas production with 0 1 0 4 v bef catalyzed 5 g bfda rmfc 5gbfda uasb were much higher than the other tests and maximum reached 86 and 240 ml d respectively ultra fast acidogenesis was achieved with 0 3 v bef supplied to bfda and the time shortened 94 h compared controlled ruasb with rmfc 5gbfda uasb with the electrochemical and microbial community analysis the redox ability and direct interspecies electron transfer accumulated with bef catalyzed the abundance of firmicutes which could generate bio hydrogen was highest in rmfc 5gbfda uasb 44 58 compared to ruasb 31 36 and r5gbfda uasb 40 04 in addition the structure and morphology variation of bfda revealed that the synergistic effects of bef stimulated iron carbon micro electrolysis for electron transferring and enhanced the activities of methanogens and acetogens with high relative abundance to biotransform organic compounds as well as adsorption and precipitation of iron oxides hematite and magnetite promoting anaerobic digestion the mfc bfda uasb integrated system provides a promising and cost effective way to enhance anaerobic digestion and recycled functionalized waste effectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb microbial fuel cell mfc blast furnace dusting ash iron carbon micro electrolysis bio electric field anaerobic digestion 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad has been successfully applied to treat industrial wastewater from paper industry meyer and edwards 2014 the food industry fang et al 2011 breweries shrestha et al 2014 and the chemical industry zhu et al 2015 however previous research had demonstrated that the performance of ad was severely limited by the excessive acidification and slow methanogenesis due to a less stabilized sludge bed with a low specific methanogenic activity zeeman and lettinga 1999 the latter has resulted in an overall deterioration of the digestion process therefore a large number of studies have been carried out in order to enhance the performance of ad mahmoud et al mahmoud et al 2004 investigated a novel pilot scale system consisting of an integrated high loaded up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor and digester for enhanced sludge activation and stabilization zhang et al zhang et al 2011 applied zero valent iron in uasb owing to it could enhance the anaerobic granulation either by promoting growth of methanogens or by advancing granule aggregation many improvements are based on high energy cost or added extra reagents therefore it is worthwhile to find promising sustainable approaches to intensify anaerobic effectively with cost reduction blast furnace dusting ash bfda is refer to the iron and steel production process to the exhaust smoke for dry cleaning and wet dust removal and the wastewater treatment of solid waste the large amount of bfda will occupy plenty of land and cause environmental pollution due to large number metals contains hleis et al 2013 the weeny bfda particle contains large amounts of fe and c which iron content with magnetite fe3o4 and hematite fe2o3 as well as some inorganic impurities such as sio2 cao mgo al2o3 if the bfda can be developed and utilized reasonable not only the secondary pollution can be prevented and improved the surrounding environment effectively but also recycled the waste as resource as plenty of fe and c involved in bfda and numerous microscopic galvanic cells are formulated in the electrolyte between iron anode and carbon cathode zhao et al 2016 the organic pollutants can be degraded by iron carbon micro electrolysis icme and the process has widespread application in the industrial and organic wastewater treatment ma and zhang 2008 lai et al lai et al 2012 treated wastewater which mixture of acrylonitrile butadiene and styrene with iron carbon reactor the results showed that in the condition of ph was 4 and the ratio of fe between c was 1 1 the highest cod removal rate was 50 55 and bod5 cod raised to 0 71 zhang et al zhang et al 2015b enhanced the dark fermentative hydrogen production by zero valent iron activated carbon micro electrolysis wang et al wang et al 2017b investigated the performance of icme on methane production in the ad process fe2 and h which generated by icme could break the carbon chains in organic matters for microbes favorably and simultaneous reducing co2 to produce methane effectively in addition specific pollutant removing can be enhanced by micro electrolysis li et al 2018 the current of electron transfer by micro electrolysis could promote activation of persulfate for further produce sulfate and opened the benzene ring therefore the poor biodegradablility pollutants degraded in the form of small molecule organic acids despite icme technology was considered no extra energy requirement long lifespan and little effect on the environment the usage of icme was also some limited by iron ions deactivation lower reaction rate and iron precipitation up to now quite a few methods have been developed to enhance process such as ultrasonic pretreatment zhou et al 2013 electro catalysis liu et al 2011 combined with fenton process wang et al 2016b and so on wu et al 2016 among them electro catalysis has received much attention during the electro catalysis the speed of redox reaction in icme was positively dependent on the current intensity wu et al 2013 therefore when an electric field was supplied to the iron carbon electrodes it was likely to intensify the reaction of electrodes and further improved the icme process microbial fuel cells mfcs have emerged in recent years as a promising sustainable technology min et al 2005 due to the electric energy can be generated through the degradation of organic matter by microorganisms the process could be applied in electro catalysis and membrane fouling mitigation potentially which was much less expensive than conventional external power supply liu et al 2018 wang et al 2016a based on the high efficiency of electro catalysis on icme the present work aims to design a novel and cost effective micro electrolysis compound system of fec which can speed up the rate of redox reaction and improve the ad process in this context bfda was placed in the uasb mfc integrated system which the uasb reactor worked as an anode chamber and the bio electric field bef further recycled to bfda the objectives were a to investigate the feasibility of bef catalyzed bfda for the enhancement of ad b to reveal the mechanism of bef enhanced icme on acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis respectively c to explore the effect of fractionation of iron during the icme process on fermentation d to comprehensively illustrate the electron transfer synergy mechanism between icme and mfc for redox reaction rate further establish an anaerobic strengthening process based on electrochemical theory the development of a novel mfc bfda uasb system will provide a feasible method for ad enhancing meanwhile the lower cost was obtained which bef generated by mfc replaced the external power and the waste recycled effectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 mfc bfda uasb configuration and operation the mfc bfda uasb system fig 1 was consisted of anode and cathode that the uasb reactor worked as an anode chamber with a volume of 2 56l internal diameter of 6 cm and height of 50 cm the structure of mfc was a single chamber without proton exchange membrane the carbon felt anode with an apparent surface area of 50 cm2 fengxiang china was submerged in the uasb reactor the carbon cloth air cathode with an apparent surface area of 50 cm2 hcp330n hesen china was 4 cm apart from anode electrode as described in previous study jia et al 2017 ag agcl electrode 0 21 v versus standard hydrogen electrode leici china was set in the flange of the reactor as a reference electrode for measuring electrode potential and its distance from anode and cathode were all 2 cm electrodes were connected to the data logging equipment via tantalum wires and titanium sheet with stainless steel crocodile clips under resistor the bfda was pressured into a sheet which submerged in sludge layer and it connected to the electrodes of mfc through copper wire the system was operated by feeding the wastewater through the bottom of uasb using a peristaltic pump bt100 2j longer china a flow meter was connected to the gas outlet of the uasb five reactors were used in this study ruasb was supplemented without bfda and bef which served as the control reactor whereas only 5 g bfda added into the uasb as r5gbfda uasb and bef which supplied by uasb mfc was attached to 3 g 5 g 8 g bfda referred to as rmfc 3gbfda uasb rmfc 5gbfda uasb rmfc 8gbfda uasb respectively the anaerobic sludge was obtained from a secondary sedimentation tank tianjin china an 850 ml bacteria suspension was injected as inoculums into the uasb reactor and fed with a synthetic wastewater containing glucose urea and kh2po4 as carbon nitrogen and phosphorous sources respectively necessary trace metal elements were added as previously study punal et al 2000 the mixed liquor suspended solids concentration of the uasb was 8000 mg l at set up 2 2 chemical and electrochemical analysis the bfda powder 200 mesh qian an coal chemical china was ground 5min by ball mill the crystallite structure of samples were verified by x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 discover germany employing a scanning rate of 0 02 deg s in the 2θ range from 10 to 80 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements were performed using a thermo k alpha spectrometer spectra were collected at a pass energy of 50ev for narrow scans and 200ev for survey scans with a 0 1ev and 1ev step respectively determining the dissolved fe ⅱ and fe ⅲ was done using the ferrozine method pournaghi azar and fatemi 2000 absorbance of the fe ⅱ and fe ⅲ ferrozine complex were measured at 562 nm on a uv spectrophotometer cary60 uv vis agilent usa the cell voltage and electrode potential were monitored at 30 min intervals using a data acquisition system agilent34972a agilent usa ph value of uasb was measured by the precise ph meter phg 210 bohaizhiyuan china the concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod was measured according to the standard method gilcreas 1971 electrochemical tests were conducted using an electrochemical workstation chi660e chenhua instruments china cyclic voltammetry cv of the anodes were performed using a conventional three electrode where the anode as the working electrode the cathode as the counter electrode and an ag agcl reference electrode the potentials between the working and reference electrodes were shifted from 1 v to 1 v at a rate of 1 mv s while monitoring the current response electrochemical impedance spectra eis for the systems were tested in the frequency range of 0 01 105 hz with amplitude of 5 mv the anode was used as the working electrode and the cathode was used as the reference as well as the counter electrode the concentration of volatile fatty acids vfas was analyzed by gas chromatograph gc 2018pfsc shimadzu japan the gc was equipped with a flame ionization detector and a nukol free fatty acid phase column the gc column was initially held 80 c for 3min increased by 15 c min to the final temperature of 210 c and maintained for 2min the injection port and detector temperatures were both 230 c nitrogen gas was the carrier gas at 30 ml min 2 3 microbial community analysis the microbial samples were collected from the sludge of uasb at the end of operating genomic dna was extracted directly with the biofilm dna extraction kit according to the instructions of manufacturers the dna extractions were subsequently determined by novogene beijing china using high throughput sequencing analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of bio electric field on uasb operating condition the analysis for fresh bfda confirmed the presence of c o fe and so on and iron content was about 59 see table s1 to test the performance of bfda for uasb operational process by bef a comparison between different systems and operating conditions were made as the reactors started up successfully the systems all changed external resistance to 500ω and hrt to 12 4 h the uasb underwent several stages 1 working stage with 0 24gcod gmlss d olr 2 working stage with 0 38gcod gmlss d olr 3 working stage with 0 48gcod gmlss d olr 4 working stage with 0 72gcod gmlss d olr 5 working stage with 0 96gcod gmlss d olr each substrate was injected into the system initially until steady and then switched to another concentration as presented in fig 2 the effect of bfda and electro catalysis for cod removal biogas and vfas production of uasb were investigated in continuous operation mode fig 2a showed the voltage variation during the several stages as the uasb mfc systems were able to convert chemical energy into electricity directly via bioprocesses catalyzed by exoelectrogenic microorganisms the voltages of different reactors increased and steadily closely with each other in different stages so it can be used to study the influence of bef on different bfda concentration as can be seen in fig 2b the cod removal rate was presented during the stage1 the cod removal rates in all reactors were increased gradually and above 60 the cod removal rates of reactors which supplied bef to bfda were higher than the control one the maximum removal rate reached 86 in rmfc 5gbfda uasb with almost 0 4 v supplied which proved to be little higher than rmfc 8gbfda uasb with 0 2 v supplied in stage3 it indicated that iron and carbon particles in bfda formed inter electrolysis like the three dimensional electrochemical processes which established based on a two dimensional electrochemical by adding a particle electrode that iron acts as anode losing two electrons to form ferrous ion and the carbon as cathode can accelerate the reduction by accepting electrons and transferring the electrons to the pollutants or oxygen at an appropriate voltage these particles are polarized to form a large number of charged microelectrodes and able to enhance the conductivity and mass transfer in addition vfa worked as the intermediate products which utilized through methanogenesis for methane production could reflect the ad process masse and droste 2000 fig 2c showed the total vfa tvfa and individual vfa proportion in stable operating conditions the tvfa increased with olr improvement and the ad process restrained when much hydrolyzate could not be consumed in all five stages the tvfa in rbfda uasb was lower than ruasb and supplied bef to appropriate bfda achieved best in rmfc 5gbfda uasb take stage3 for example the tvfa declined from 183 18 mg l in ruasb to 77 8 mg l in rmfc 5gbfda uasb which lower than 139 87 mg l in r5gbfda uasb the ph values were all nearly 6 5 which higher than ruasb correspondingly this was mainly due to hydrogen ion was consumed at carbon cathode with the reaction 2h 2e 2 h h2 and resulted in acid anesis the total biogas production and gas yield load increased with bef supplied to bfda and higher than the controlled one fig 2d it indicated that icme enhanced the activities of methanogens however redundant bfda concentration would make the facilitated effect weaker due to the corrosion induced collapse of environment in system which unsuitable for the growth of germ and inactivated of microorganisms 3 2 effect of electro catalyzed bfda on anaerobic digestion phase to clarify the effects of bef catalyzed bfda on the anaerobic phase a 2 5l glucose wastewater with 1000 mg l concentration was added into entirely fig s1 a showed the variation of voltage which could reflect the operating condition during the complete anaerobic process jia et al 2016 bef accelerated fe2 leaching fe 2e fe2 and enhanced the growth and activity of acidogens caused the voltage variation in rmfc bfda uasb was different with ruasb in addition the bef catalyzed icme consumed more h and increase alkalinity so the methanogenes in rmfc 5gbfda uasb had better capacity to degrade acetate and obtained higher ph see fig s1b acidification efficiency is one of the most important parameter to evaluate the efficiency of acidogenesis which can be defined as the ratio of tvfa to the effluent cod zhang et al 2015a as shown in fig 3 the variation of individual vfa and acidification efficiency were presented at the first 5 h in ruasb the tvfa was 68 mg l and the effluent cod was 678 mg l which the acidification efficiency was 10 03 the lower acidification efficiency means that much carbohydrate had not degraded via acidogenesis phase yet the acetic propionic and butyric acids were dominant and the proportions were 30 93 29 01 and 22 26 respectively the tvfa increased and effluent cod decreased with ad going incessantly before 87 h the tvfa all about 100 160 mg l but it increased to 290 mg l at 121 h and the acidification efficiency was 68 indicating that vfas were the major substrates while fermentation played a leading role under the action of acidogens the butyric acid converted to acetic acid and further utilized under the acetogenesis phase and methanogenesis phase it used for methane production with the proportion of acetic decreased after 181 h the acidification efficiency in rbfda uasb enhanced significantly at 38 h which shortened 73 h compared to ruasb with bef supplied ultra fast acidogenesis was achieved and the time needed were 51 h 27 h and 63 h in rmfc 3gbfda uasb to rmfc 8gbfda uasb respectively this was probably due to the decomposition of organic matter that occurred prior to the oxidation and broken into small molecule substances by free hydrogen radicals h feng et al feng et al 2014 found that ferrous ion promoted cellulose decomposition and the activities of several key enzymes related to acidification increased indeed methanogenesis was important for ad which associated with the release of soluble metabolites analyzed from the point of metabolic pathway the butyric acid type fermentation was given priority initially and the proportion of butyric acid increased with bfda and bef added simultaneously in theory methane production generally correlated with the metabolic pathway of acetic acid and co2 reducing pathway 1 ch3cooh ch4 co2 δg 33 kj 2 4h2 co2 ch4 2h2o δg 135 kj this data proved that bef promoted hydrogen production during icme and co2 reducing pathway more energetically favourable considered the gibb s free energy change the oxidation reduction potential fig s1c decreased which converted to ch4 during co2 reducing pathway resulted degradation resistance was broken and butyric acid able to be converted to acetic acid ch3ch2ch2coo 2h2o 2ch3coo h 2h2 the aceticlastic pathway further proceeded for methane production therefore the well balanced through coordinate regulation between h2 co2 and ch3cooh lead to the optimal anaerobic digestion 3 3 the influence of bef catalyzed bfda on direct interspecies electron transfer direct interspecies electron transfer diet was an important syntrophic process that plays a pivotal role in stable methanogenesis which did not require the multiple enzymatic steps to produce hydrogen to function as an electron shuttle baek et al 2016 methanogenesis could be facilitated by adding conductive material to stimulate diet in previously researches baek et al baek et al 2017 reported that diet was promoted by the presence of magnetite as electrical conduit and enhanced biomethanation as bfda consist of large iron and conductive iron oxides it might work on diet therefore the effect of bfda on the electrochemical property was investigated in the following section the redox ability and internal resistance of system with 0 48gcod gmlss d olr were investigated by cv and eis in fig 4 as we can see from it no redox peaks were found in ruasb and r5gbfda uasb but the area of cv which could be represented the capacitive character in r5gbfda uasb was larger than in ruasb a slight oxidation peaks could be observed in rmfc 5gbfda uasb and rmfc 8gbfda uasb indicating that redox reaction of organic degraded was intensified through bef catalyzed galvanic cell promoted the dissolution of ferrous ion and enhanced the electrochemical activity of bacteria fig 4b showed the comparison of nyquist plots of eis after operating steadily the high frequency charge transfer activation process which is related to the electrons charge transfer in the anodic and cathodic electrodes and the low frequency mass transfer limited process which contains the diffusion of the organic substrate in the biofilm and the transfer of charges at the biofilm interface hidalgo et al 2015 were recognized in order to quantitatively evaluate the electrochemical performances of the integrated system the measured spectra were fitted through the equivalent circuit fig 4c d and e it can be observed that the rs decreased from 20 44ω in ruasb to 9 88ω in rmfc 5gbfda uasb probably caused by lower vfa concentration and higher iron ion concentration which reduced the viscosity of the anolyte to relieve resistance and enhanced the ion strength to elevate conductivity respectively regarding the charge transfer process the estimate of rct in ruasb was 129ω which was greater than the mfc bfda uasb reactors it was mainly due to the acid base equilibrium was broken and biofilm was damaged that restrained electronic transport and limited the ionic mobility the lower rct in mfc bfda uasb reactors represented favourable charge discharge property of electrode and higher growth of microorganisms meanwhile the impact of bfda concentration was crucial in the reduction activity rmfc 5gbfda uasb displayed a lowest semicircle throughout the entire frequency the depressed semicircles with bef enhanced bfda could be attributed to the ionic migration process in the iron carbon film the iron corrosion only existed in r5gbfda uasb which attributed to bef reduced the coverage of corrosion layer on bfda in the magnetic and electric field the corrosion slightly under the lorentz force the bio electric field could maintain magnetism and then the lorentz force played a role in the subsequent reaction therefore the extent of corrosion of bfda uasb reactor was more seriously than that of mfc bfda uasb reactors from the above cv and eis results revealed that such a high electrochemical activity with bef catalyzed system should be resulted from the role of the electric driving force for the electron transport and it benefited organic degradation fe2 could be oxidized to fe3 by iron oxidizing bacteria and ferric oxide further reduced to fe2 by dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria the circulation of iron oxidation and reduction lead fe2 and fe3 were provided with the function of redox mediator wang et al 2017a furthermore the magnetite adhered to microbial cell surfaces and formed aggregate structures bridging cell connections with its conductive nature it may therefore be concluded that magnetite as conduit and ferrous ion as redox mediator were the key mechanisms that facilitated diet process 3 4 microbial community analysis it is well known that the primary microorganisms in the anaerobic reactors consisted of bacteria and archaea for deeper insight into the underlying ecology the changes in microbial community on three reactors samples ruasb r5gbfda uasb and rmfc 5gbfda uasb were analyzed the richness diversity and composition of microbial community enhanced by bfda which every out presented one kind of microbial species nichkova and marco 2006 see tables2 and fig s2 this can be corresponding with the result of anaerobic digestion promoted by bef catalyzed bfda in order to further explore the evolution of microbial population investigations on the microbial composition and relative abundance in phylum level were necessary fig 5 the major bacteria communities in the shared otus were firmicutes actinobacteria proteobacteria and bacteroidetes firmicutes was predominant in all three samples accounting for 31 36 40 04 and 44 58 in ruasb r5gbfda uasb and rmfc 5gbfda uasb respectively it showed a slight improvement with bfda and bef addition it was assumed to be important in degrading high molecular weight compounds and wastewater treatment the selective enrichment of firmicutes might be attributed to its potential ability of electron transfer the relatively abundance of proteobacteria in ruasb was 3 7 followed by r5gbfda uasb 11 3 and rmfc 5gbfda uasb 20 5 it mainly contained some known exoelectrogens which have function of current generation this trend agreed with previous investigation on the microbial community structure of icme on anaerobic process the results showed that the bacteria community structure changed with bef catalyzed bfda addition in order to further explore the evolution of bacteria community the effective reads was assigned on the genus level as shown in table s3 and table s4 it was found that the relatively abundance of clostridium sensu stricto 1 of rmfc 5gbfda uasb 19 76 was 195 higher than that of ruasb 6 69 and 56 higher than that of r5gbfda uasb 12 66 previous researches have revealed that clostridium obligate anaerobes generate bio hydrogen in anaerobic fermentation where vfas including acetic acid produced zhang et al 2015b the relatively abundance of genus streptococcus geobacter unidentified propionibacteriaceae in the biofilm of rmfc 5gbfda uasb was much higher than that in ruasb geobacter belonged to the class deltaproteobacteria which had been identified as a major source of exoelectrogens clostridium sensu stricto 1 streptococcus unidentified propionibacteriaceae belonged to fermentative bacteria which can ferment organics to lactic acetic propionic acids and h2 the relative abundance of archaea was an important evidence to elucidate the ad process as can be seen in table s4 methanobacterium was the predominant species and the relative abundance were all around 60 in the three systems which ruasb ahead by a lesser margin methanobacterium belonged to the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea and they utilized h2 and co2 as substrates the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea was in symbiosis with acetogenic bacteria and relieve the accumulation of propionate zhang et al 2012 methanosaeta and methanosarcina belonged to acetoclastic methanogenic archaea who utilized acetate as substrates and helped degrade acetate to maintain a neutral ph the summation of methanosaeta and methanosarcina in rmfc 5gbfda uasb was 29 81 which higher than 18 19 and 22 76 in ruasb and r5gbfda uasb respectively this finding agreed with the aceticlastic pathway proceeded for methane production in fig 3 methanoregula is a genus of the methanomicrobiales and it produces methane at the lowest ph of any known organism brauer et al 2006 the reaction of icme could maintain a beneficial ph for the growth of methanogens karri et al karri et al 2005 also reported that addition of iron improved the methanogenic activity of the sludge thus the microbial population structure became more stable with the electro catalyzed bfda it also explained why the better organic reduction and higher biogas production were obtained with the presence of bef and iron carbon electrodes 3 5 mechanism of fe leaching and iron oxide synergistic effect on ad fe2 was confirmed as a key element to accelerate microbial metabolism and maintain high activity of some enzyme of acidogenesis such as pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase liu et al 2012 however the corrosion on the surface of bfda will occur during the long period operation and will weaken the role previously study had demonstrated that corroded slightly with the action of magnetic field and as the reaction went on the more iron ion leached li et al 2018 therefore the variation of fe leaching could explain the ad enhancement to some extent as can be seen in table 1 studied here were the variations in fe2 and fe3 concentration in sludge and effluent with added bef after running the fe2 in sludge was 10 61 mg l in r5gbfda uasb due to bfda was located in sludge layer there was more fe2 and fe3 than effluent moreover bef reinforced fec reaction and released more fe2 it achieved 17 3 mg l and 27 66 mg l in rmfc 5gbfda uasb and rmfc 8gbfda uasb respectively previous studies showed that fe2 at low concentration could enhance microbial growth and agglomeration zhang et al 2018 thus a stable microbial population structure was observed to some extent the xps spectra of sludge after operating was combined with the iron ion concentration to analysis the variation of iron morphology see fig 6 it revealed that the surface of sludge in the four reactors contained mainly c and o with trace amounts of fe fig 6a due to the iron content was lower high resolution xps spectra of o 1s was highlighted to determine the oxidation state of leached fe fig 6b three common peaks of o 1s were all found for the four reactors the peak at around 532 2 and 532 8ev belonging to co coo and coh bond respectively which from organics the peak at around 531 5ev was assigned to the hydroxyl on the surface of iron oxide or hydroxide such as feooh or fe oh 3 it indicated that the surface of iron oxide coordination unsaturation and binding water molecules to generate feooh by comparing the peak area of feooh the intensity of feooh bond increased dramatically with bef catalyzed and bfda increased in addition one peak at around 530ev which attributed to feo bond was observed in rmfc 3gbfda uasb rmfc 5gbfda uasb and rmfc 8gbfda uasb due to h and o2 byproducts were produced in icme and produced iron oxides overall the xps confirms that few fe was adsorbed to the surface of sludge and likely present as oxide or hydroxide surface precipitates the mechanisms for removing organic pollutants in mfc bfda uasb include both physical processes and biochemical processes generally microbial degradation was accepted as the dominant process which intensified by icme nonetheless the adsorption and precipitation of iron oxides in bfda was considered another important removal pathway for studying the effect of bef on the iron forms the structure and morphology variation of bdfa was characterized see fig 6c xrd analyzed that the following peaks 104 110 113 024 and 116 which corresponding to the diffraction peaks in α fe2o3 the peak of 220 and 311 corresponding to fe3o4 was observed indicating that fresh bfda was consisted of α fe2o3 and fe3o4 and has high degree of crystallinity however very wide diffraction peaks were displayed at 30 6 33 2 and 35 6 after running in the four reactors except rmfc 5gbfda uasb the relative intensities of the peaks were greatly diminished indicating poorly crystallized precipitates obtained it might be attributed to the competing results of organic acid and hydroxyl groups to form polymorphic amorphous fe oh 3 gao et al 2018 and the bef might stimulate the inner fe2 and fe3 ions of the fe3o4 diffused outward to form fe2o3 crystals continuously in rmfc 5gbfda uasb formation of ferric hydroxide coating on the iron surface started to block electron transfer and caused deactivation of iron surfaces this gradually reduced the occurrence of electrochemical reactions the deconvoluted high resolution xps spectra of fe 2p peak for bfda was carried out to further demonstrate the effect of bef on iron oxide fig 6d images showed the xps peaks of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 core level electrons for the bfda which approached 711ev and 724ev corresponding to the 2p electron orbit of iron atom in fe3o4 and 712ev and 725ev corresponding to 2p electron orbit in fe2o3 jiang et al 2011 the absence of the satellite peak situated at about 719ev which is a characteristic of fe3 in fe2o3 of these peaks the area of fe 2p peak in rmfc 5gbfda uasb was greater than that of in other reactors indicated that the content of fe2o3 and fe3o4 was higher and be conductive to absorb and precipitate therefore the bef was benefit to promote the synergistic effect of hematite and magnetite however there are some risks in using much bfda due to excessive ferric ions being toxic to microorganism hazards should be avoided through a rational control of bfda on the other hand only few mg and si were detected in effluent which below 1 mg l and 0 2 mg l respectively and none of toxic detected which satisfied the integrated wastewater discharge standard in china gb 8978 1996 thus ensuring bfda is effective and will not cause secondary pollution to the environment 4 conclusion a novel and cost effect approach for effective enhance anaerobic digestion was developed via bef which generated by mfc supplied to bfda combined with uasb the experimental findings showed that bef catalyzed bfda improved the cod removal rate and biogas production the synergistic effect in this process not only bef stimulated numerous microscopic galvanic cells formulated on icme for intensified diet but also strengthened the activities of methanogens and acetogens and achieved ultra fast acidogenesis thereby enhancing organic compounds degradation this research has provided promising manner and information to enhance anaerobic digestion and recycled functionalized waste effectively

19147,in this study a novel manner of bio electric field bef which generated by upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb microbial fuel cell mfc integrated system facilitated iron carbon micro electrolysis in blast furnace dusting ash bfda was proposed for the reinforcement of anaerobic digestion in uasb the responses of cod removal efficiency and biogas production with 0 1 0 4 v bef catalyzed 5 g bfda rmfc 5gbfda uasb were much higher than the other tests and maximum reached 86 and 240 ml d respectively ultra fast acidogenesis was achieved with 0 3 v bef supplied to bfda and the time shortened 94 h compared controlled ruasb with rmfc 5gbfda uasb with the electrochemical and microbial community analysis the redox ability and direct interspecies electron transfer accumulated with bef catalyzed the abundance of firmicutes which could generate bio hydrogen was highest in rmfc 5gbfda uasb 44 58 compared to ruasb 31 36 and r5gbfda uasb 40 04 in addition the structure and morphology variation of bfda revealed that the synergistic effects of bef stimulated iron carbon micro electrolysis for electron transferring and enhanced the activities of methanogens and acetogens with high relative abundance to biotransform organic compounds as well as adsorption and precipitation of iron oxides hematite and magnetite promoting anaerobic digestion the mfc bfda uasb integrated system provides a promising and cost effective way to enhance anaerobic digestion and recycled functionalized waste effectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb microbial fuel cell mfc blast furnace dusting ash iron carbon micro electrolysis bio electric field anaerobic digestion 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad has been successfully applied to treat industrial wastewater from paper industry meyer and edwards 2014 the food industry fang et al 2011 breweries shrestha et al 2014 and the chemical industry zhu et al 2015 however previous research had demonstrated that the performance of ad was severely limited by the excessive acidification and slow methanogenesis due to a less stabilized sludge bed with a low specific methanogenic activity zeeman and lettinga 1999 the latter has resulted in an overall deterioration of the digestion process therefore a large number of studies have been carried out in order to enhance the performance of ad mahmoud et al mahmoud et al 2004 investigated a novel pilot scale system consisting of an integrated high loaded up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor and digester for enhanced sludge activation and stabilization zhang et al zhang et al 2011 applied zero valent iron in uasb owing to it could enhance the anaerobic granulation either by promoting growth of methanogens or by advancing granule aggregation many improvements are based on high energy cost or added extra reagents therefore it is worthwhile to find promising sustainable approaches to intensify anaerobic effectively with cost reduction blast furnace dusting ash bfda is refer to the iron and steel production process to the exhaust smoke for dry cleaning and wet dust removal and the wastewater treatment of solid waste the large amount of bfda will occupy plenty of land and cause environmental pollution due to large number metals contains hleis et al 2013 the weeny bfda particle contains large amounts of fe and c which iron content with magnetite fe3o4 and hematite fe2o3 as well as some inorganic impurities such as sio2 cao mgo al2o3 if the bfda can be developed and utilized reasonable not only the secondary pollution can be prevented and improved the surrounding environment effectively but also recycled the waste as resource as plenty of fe and c involved in bfda and numerous microscopic galvanic cells are formulated in the electrolyte between iron anode and carbon cathode zhao et al 2016 the organic pollutants can be degraded by iron carbon micro electrolysis icme and the process has widespread application in the industrial and organic wastewater treatment ma and zhang 2008 lai et al lai et al 2012 treated wastewater which mixture of acrylonitrile butadiene and styrene with iron carbon reactor the results showed that in the condition of ph was 4 and the ratio of fe between c was 1 1 the highest cod removal rate was 50 55 and bod5 cod raised to 0 71 zhang et al zhang et al 2015b enhanced the dark fermentative hydrogen production by zero valent iron activated carbon micro electrolysis wang et al wang et al 2017b investigated the performance of icme on methane production in the ad process fe2 and h which generated by icme could break the carbon chains in organic matters for microbes favorably and simultaneous reducing co2 to produce methane effectively in addition specific pollutant removing can be enhanced by micro electrolysis li et al 2018 the current of electron transfer by micro electrolysis could promote activation of persulfate for further produce sulfate and opened the benzene ring therefore the poor biodegradablility pollutants degraded in the form of small molecule organic acids despite icme technology was considered no extra energy requirement long lifespan and little effect on the environment the usage of icme was also some limited by iron ions deactivation lower reaction rate and iron precipitation up to now quite a few methods have been developed to enhance process such as ultrasonic pretreatment zhou et al 2013 electro catalysis liu et al 2011 combined with fenton process wang et al 2016b and so on wu et al 2016 among them electro catalysis has received much attention during the electro catalysis the speed of redox reaction in icme was positively dependent on the current intensity wu et al 2013 therefore when an electric field was supplied to the iron carbon electrodes it was likely to intensify the reaction of electrodes and further improved the icme process microbial fuel cells mfcs have emerged in recent years as a promising sustainable technology min et al 2005 due to the electric energy can be generated through the degradation of organic matter by microorganisms the process could be applied in electro catalysis and membrane fouling mitigation potentially which was much less expensive than conventional external power supply liu et al 2018 wang et al 2016a based on the high efficiency of electro catalysis on icme the present work aims to design a novel and cost effective micro electrolysis compound system of fec which can speed up the rate of redox reaction and improve the ad process in this context bfda was placed in the uasb mfc integrated system which the uasb reactor worked as an anode chamber and the bio electric field bef further recycled to bfda the objectives were a to investigate the feasibility of bef catalyzed bfda for the enhancement of ad b to reveal the mechanism of bef enhanced icme on acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis respectively c to explore the effect of fractionation of iron during the icme process on fermentation d to comprehensively illustrate the electron transfer synergy mechanism between icme and mfc for redox reaction rate further establish an anaerobic strengthening process based on electrochemical theory the development of a novel mfc bfda uasb system will provide a feasible method for ad enhancing meanwhile the lower cost was obtained which bef generated by mfc replaced the external power and the waste recycled effectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 mfc bfda uasb configuration and operation the mfc bfda uasb system fig 1 was consisted of anode and cathode that the uasb reactor worked as an anode chamber with a volume of 2 56l internal diameter of 6 cm and height of 50 cm the structure of mfc was a single chamber without proton exchange membrane the carbon felt anode with an apparent surface area of 50 cm2 fengxiang china was submerged in the uasb reactor the carbon cloth air cathode with an apparent surface area of 50 cm2 hcp330n hesen china was 4 cm apart from anode electrode as described in previous study jia et al 2017 ag agcl electrode 0 21 v versus standard hydrogen electrode leici china was set in the flange of the reactor as a reference electrode for measuring electrode potential and its distance from anode and cathode were all 2 cm electrodes were connected to the data logging equipment via tantalum wires and titanium sheet with stainless steel crocodile clips under resistor the bfda was pressured into a sheet which submerged in sludge layer and it connected to the electrodes of mfc through copper wire the system was operated by feeding the wastewater through the bottom of uasb using a peristaltic pump bt100 2j longer china a flow meter was connected to the gas outlet of the uasb five reactors were used in this study ruasb was supplemented without bfda and bef which served as the control reactor whereas only 5 g bfda added into the uasb as r5gbfda uasb and bef which supplied by uasb mfc was attached to 3 g 5 g 8 g bfda referred to as rmfc 3gbfda uasb rmfc 5gbfda uasb rmfc 8gbfda uasb respectively the anaerobic sludge was obtained from a secondary sedimentation tank tianjin china an 850 ml bacteria suspension was injected as inoculums into the uasb reactor and fed with a synthetic wastewater containing glucose urea and kh2po4 as carbon nitrogen and phosphorous sources respectively necessary trace metal elements were added as previously study punal et al 2000 the mixed liquor suspended solids concentration of the uasb was 8000 mg l at set up 2 2 chemical and electrochemical analysis the bfda powder 200 mesh qian an coal chemical china was ground 5min by ball mill the crystallite structure of samples were verified by x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 discover germany employing a scanning rate of 0 02 deg s in the 2θ range from 10 to 80 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements were performed using a thermo k alpha spectrometer spectra were collected at a pass energy of 50ev for narrow scans and 200ev for survey scans with a 0 1ev and 1ev step respectively determining the dissolved fe ⅱ and fe ⅲ was done using the ferrozine method pournaghi azar and fatemi 2000 absorbance of the fe ⅱ and fe ⅲ ferrozine complex were measured at 562 nm on a uv spectrophotometer cary60 uv vis agilent usa the cell voltage and electrode potential were monitored at 30 min intervals using a data acquisition system agilent34972a agilent usa ph value of uasb was measured by the precise ph meter phg 210 bohaizhiyuan china the concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod was measured according to the standard method gilcreas 1971 electrochemical tests were conducted using an electrochemical workstation chi660e chenhua instruments china cyclic voltammetry cv of the anodes were performed using a conventional three electrode where the anode as the working electrode the cathode as the counter electrode and an ag agcl reference electrode the potentials between the working and reference electrodes were shifted from 1 v to 1 v at a rate of 1 mv s while monitoring the current response electrochemical impedance spectra eis for the systems were tested in the frequency range of 0 01 105 hz with amplitude of 5 mv the anode was used as the working electrode and the cathode was used as the reference as well as the counter electrode the concentration of volatile fatty acids vfas was analyzed by gas chromatograph gc 2018pfsc shimadzu japan the gc was equipped with a flame ionization detector and a nukol free fatty acid phase column the gc column was initially held 80 c for 3min increased by 15 c min to the final temperature of 210 c and maintained for 2min the injection port and detector temperatures were both 230 c nitrogen gas was the carrier gas at 30 ml min 2 3 microbial community analysis the microbial samples were collected from the sludge of uasb at the end of operating genomic dna was extracted directly with the biofilm dna extraction kit according to the instructions of manufacturers the dna extractions were subsequently determined by novogene beijing china using high throughput sequencing analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of bio electric field on uasb operating condition the analysis for fresh bfda confirmed the presence of c o fe and so on and iron content was about 59 see table s1 to test the performance of bfda for uasb operational process by bef a comparison between different systems and operating conditions were made as the reactors started up successfully the systems all changed external resistance to 500ω and hrt to 12 4 h the uasb underwent several stages 1 working stage with 0 24gcod gmlss d olr 2 working stage with 0 38gcod gmlss d olr 3 working stage with 0 48gcod gmlss d olr 4 working stage with 0 72gcod gmlss d olr 5 working stage with 0 96gcod gmlss d olr each substrate was injected into the system initially until steady and then switched to another concentration as presented in fig 2 the effect of bfda and electro catalysis for cod removal biogas and vfas production of uasb were investigated in continuous operation mode fig 2a showed the voltage variation during the several stages as the uasb mfc systems were able to convert chemical energy into electricity directly via bioprocesses catalyzed by exoelectrogenic microorganisms the voltages of different reactors increased and steadily closely with each other in different stages so it can be used to study the influence of bef on different bfda concentration as can be seen in fig 2b the cod removal rate was presented during the stage1 the cod removal rates in all reactors were increased gradually and above 60 the cod removal rates of reactors which supplied bef to bfda were higher than the control one the maximum removal rate reached 86 in rmfc 5gbfda uasb with almost 0 4 v supplied which proved to be little higher than rmfc 8gbfda uasb with 0 2 v supplied in stage3 it indicated that iron and carbon particles in bfda formed inter electrolysis like the three dimensional electrochemical processes which established based on a two dimensional electrochemical by adding a particle electrode that iron acts as anode losing two electrons to form ferrous ion and the carbon as cathode can accelerate the reduction by accepting electrons and transferring the electrons to the pollutants or oxygen at an appropriate voltage these particles are polarized to form a large number of charged microelectrodes and able to enhance the conductivity and mass transfer in addition vfa worked as the intermediate products which utilized through methanogenesis for methane production could reflect the ad process masse and droste 2000 fig 2c showed the total vfa tvfa and individual vfa proportion in stable operating conditions the tvfa increased with olr improvement and the ad process restrained when much hydrolyzate could not be consumed in all five stages the tvfa in rbfda uasb was lower than ruasb and supplied bef to appropriate bfda achieved best in rmfc 5gbfda uasb take stage3 for example the tvfa declined from 183 18 mg l in ruasb to 77 8 mg l in rmfc 5gbfda uasb which lower than 139 87 mg l in r5gbfda uasb the ph values were all nearly 6 5 which higher than ruasb correspondingly this was mainly due to hydrogen ion was consumed at carbon cathode with the reaction 2h 2e 2 h h2 and resulted in acid anesis the total biogas production and gas yield load increased with bef supplied to bfda and higher than the controlled one fig 2d it indicated that icme enhanced the activities of methanogens however redundant bfda concentration would make the facilitated effect weaker due to the corrosion induced collapse of environment in system which unsuitable for the growth of germ and inactivated of microorganisms 3 2 effect of electro catalyzed bfda on anaerobic digestion phase to clarify the effects of bef catalyzed bfda on the anaerobic phase a 2 5l glucose wastewater with 1000 mg l concentration was added into entirely fig s1 a showed the variation of voltage which could reflect the operating condition during the complete anaerobic process jia et al 2016 bef accelerated fe2 leaching fe 2e fe2 and enhanced the growth and activity of acidogens caused the voltage variation in rmfc bfda uasb was different with ruasb in addition the bef catalyzed icme consumed more h and increase alkalinity so the methanogenes in rmfc 5gbfda uasb had better capacity to degrade acetate and obtained higher ph see fig s1b acidification efficiency is one of the most important parameter to evaluate the efficiency of acidogenesis which can be defined as the ratio of tvfa to the effluent cod zhang et al 2015a as shown in fig 3 the variation of individual vfa and acidification efficiency were presented at the first 5 h in ruasb the tvfa was 68 mg l and the effluent cod was 678 mg l which the acidification efficiency was 10 03 the lower acidification efficiency means that much carbohydrate had not degraded via acidogenesis phase yet the acetic propionic and butyric acids were dominant and the proportions were 30 93 29 01 and 22 26 respectively the tvfa increased and effluent cod decreased with ad going incessantly before 87 h the tvfa all about 100 160 mg l but it increased to 290 mg l at 121 h and the acidification efficiency was 68 indicating that vfas were the major substrates while fermentation played a leading role under the action of acidogens the butyric acid converted to acetic acid and further utilized under the acetogenesis phase and methanogenesis phase it used for methane production with the proportion of acetic decreased after 181 h the acidification efficiency in rbfda uasb enhanced significantly at 38 h which shortened 73 h compared to ruasb with bef supplied ultra fast acidogenesis was achieved and the time needed were 51 h 27 h and 63 h in rmfc 3gbfda uasb to rmfc 8gbfda uasb respectively this was probably due to the decomposition of organic matter that occurred prior to the oxidation and broken into small molecule substances by free hydrogen radicals h feng et al feng et al 2014 found that ferrous ion promoted cellulose decomposition and the activities of several key enzymes related to acidification increased indeed methanogenesis was important for ad which associated with the release of soluble metabolites analyzed from the point of metabolic pathway the butyric acid type fermentation was given priority initially and the proportion of butyric acid increased with bfda and bef added simultaneously in theory methane production generally correlated with the metabolic pathway of acetic acid and co2 reducing pathway 1 ch3cooh ch4 co2 δg 33 kj 2 4h2 co2 ch4 2h2o δg 135 kj this data proved that bef promoted hydrogen production during icme and co2 reducing pathway more energetically favourable considered the gibb s free energy change the oxidation reduction potential fig s1c decreased which converted to ch4 during co2 reducing pathway resulted degradation resistance was broken and butyric acid able to be converted to acetic acid ch3ch2ch2coo 2h2o 2ch3coo h 2h2 the aceticlastic pathway further proceeded for methane production therefore the well balanced through coordinate regulation between h2 co2 and ch3cooh lead to the optimal anaerobic digestion 3 3 the influence of bef catalyzed bfda on direct interspecies electron transfer direct interspecies electron transfer diet was an important syntrophic process that plays a pivotal role in stable methanogenesis which did not require the multiple enzymatic steps to produce hydrogen to function as an electron shuttle baek et al 2016 methanogenesis could be facilitated by adding conductive material to stimulate diet in previously researches baek et al baek et al 2017 reported that diet was promoted by the presence of magnetite as electrical conduit and enhanced biomethanation as bfda consist of large iron and conductive iron oxides it might work on diet therefore the effect of bfda on the electrochemical property was investigated in the following section the redox ability and internal resistance of system with 0 48gcod gmlss d olr were investigated by cv and eis in fig 4 as we can see from it no redox peaks were found in ruasb and r5gbfda uasb but the area of cv which could be represented the capacitive character in r5gbfda uasb was larger than in ruasb a slight oxidation peaks could be observed in rmfc 5gbfda uasb and rmfc 8gbfda uasb indicating that redox reaction of organic degraded was intensified through bef catalyzed galvanic cell promoted the dissolution of ferrous ion and enhanced the electrochemical activity of bacteria fig 4b showed the comparison of nyquist plots of eis after operating steadily the high frequency charge transfer activation process which is related to the electrons charge transfer in the anodic and cathodic electrodes and the low frequency mass transfer limited process which contains the diffusion of the organic substrate in the biofilm and the transfer of charges at the biofilm interface hidalgo et al 2015 were recognized in order to quantitatively evaluate the electrochemical performances of the integrated system the measured spectra were fitted through the equivalent circuit fig 4c d and e it can be observed that the rs decreased from 20 44ω in ruasb to 9 88ω in rmfc 5gbfda uasb probably caused by lower vfa concentration and higher iron ion concentration which reduced the viscosity of the anolyte to relieve resistance and enhanced the ion strength to elevate conductivity respectively regarding the charge transfer process the estimate of rct in ruasb was 129ω which was greater than the mfc bfda uasb reactors it was mainly due to the acid base equilibrium was broken and biofilm was damaged that restrained electronic transport and limited the ionic mobility the lower rct in mfc bfda uasb reactors represented favourable charge discharge property of electrode and higher growth of microorganisms meanwhile the impact of bfda concentration was crucial in the reduction activity rmfc 5gbfda uasb displayed a lowest semicircle throughout the entire frequency the depressed semicircles with bef enhanced bfda could be attributed to the ionic migration process in the iron carbon film the iron corrosion only existed in r5gbfda uasb which attributed to bef reduced the coverage of corrosion layer on bfda in the magnetic and electric field the corrosion slightly under the lorentz force the bio electric field could maintain magnetism and then the lorentz force played a role in the subsequent reaction therefore the extent of corrosion of bfda uasb reactor was more seriously than that of mfc bfda uasb reactors from the above cv and eis results revealed that such a high electrochemical activity with bef catalyzed system should be resulted from the role of the electric driving force for the electron transport and it benefited organic degradation fe2 could be oxidized to fe3 by iron oxidizing bacteria and ferric oxide further reduced to fe2 by dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria the circulation of iron oxidation and reduction lead fe2 and fe3 were provided with the function of redox mediator wang et al 2017a furthermore the magnetite adhered to microbial cell surfaces and formed aggregate structures bridging cell connections with its conductive nature it may therefore be concluded that magnetite as conduit and ferrous ion as redox mediator were the key mechanisms that facilitated diet process 3 4 microbial community analysis it is well known that the primary microorganisms in the anaerobic reactors consisted of bacteria and archaea for deeper insight into the underlying ecology the changes in microbial community on three reactors samples ruasb r5gbfda uasb and rmfc 5gbfda uasb were analyzed the richness diversity and composition of microbial community enhanced by bfda which every out presented one kind of microbial species nichkova and marco 2006 see tables2 and fig s2 this can be corresponding with the result of anaerobic digestion promoted by bef catalyzed bfda in order to further explore the evolution of microbial population investigations on the microbial composition and relative abundance in phylum level were necessary fig 5 the major bacteria communities in the shared otus were firmicutes actinobacteria proteobacteria and bacteroidetes firmicutes was predominant in all three samples accounting for 31 36 40 04 and 44 58 in ruasb r5gbfda uasb and rmfc 5gbfda uasb respectively it showed a slight improvement with bfda and bef addition it was assumed to be important in degrading high molecular weight compounds and wastewater treatment the selective enrichment of firmicutes might be attributed to its potential ability of electron transfer the relatively abundance of proteobacteria in ruasb was 3 7 followed by r5gbfda uasb 11 3 and rmfc 5gbfda uasb 20 5 it mainly contained some known exoelectrogens which have function of current generation this trend agreed with previous investigation on the microbial community structure of icme on anaerobic process the results showed that the bacteria community structure changed with bef catalyzed bfda addition in order to further explore the evolution of bacteria community the effective reads was assigned on the genus level as shown in table s3 and table s4 it was found that the relatively abundance of clostridium sensu stricto 1 of rmfc 5gbfda uasb 19 76 was 195 higher than that of ruasb 6 69 and 56 higher than that of r5gbfda uasb 12 66 previous researches have revealed that clostridium obligate anaerobes generate bio hydrogen in anaerobic fermentation where vfas including acetic acid produced zhang et al 2015b the relatively abundance of genus streptococcus geobacter unidentified propionibacteriaceae in the biofilm of rmfc 5gbfda uasb was much higher than that in ruasb geobacter belonged to the class deltaproteobacteria which had been identified as a major source of exoelectrogens clostridium sensu stricto 1 streptococcus unidentified propionibacteriaceae belonged to fermentative bacteria which can ferment organics to lactic acetic propionic acids and h2 the relative abundance of archaea was an important evidence to elucidate the ad process as can be seen in table s4 methanobacterium was the predominant species and the relative abundance were all around 60 in the three systems which ruasb ahead by a lesser margin methanobacterium belonged to the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea and they utilized h2 and co2 as substrates the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea was in symbiosis with acetogenic bacteria and relieve the accumulation of propionate zhang et al 2012 methanosaeta and methanosarcina belonged to acetoclastic methanogenic archaea who utilized acetate as substrates and helped degrade acetate to maintain a neutral ph the summation of methanosaeta and methanosarcina in rmfc 5gbfda uasb was 29 81 which higher than 18 19 and 22 76 in ruasb and r5gbfda uasb respectively this finding agreed with the aceticlastic pathway proceeded for methane production in fig 3 methanoregula is a genus of the methanomicrobiales and it produces methane at the lowest ph of any known organism brauer et al 2006 the reaction of icme could maintain a beneficial ph for the growth of methanogens karri et al karri et al 2005 also reported that addition of iron improved the methanogenic activity of the sludge thus the microbial population structure became more stable with the electro catalyzed bfda it also explained why the better organic reduction and higher biogas production were obtained with the presence of bef and iron carbon electrodes 3 5 mechanism of fe leaching and iron oxide synergistic effect on ad fe2 was confirmed as a key element to accelerate microbial metabolism and maintain high activity of some enzyme of acidogenesis such as pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase liu et al 2012 however the corrosion on the surface of bfda will occur during the long period operation and will weaken the role previously study had demonstrated that corroded slightly with the action of magnetic field and as the reaction went on the more iron ion leached li et al 2018 therefore the variation of fe leaching could explain the ad enhancement to some extent as can be seen in table 1 studied here were the variations in fe2 and fe3 concentration in sludge and effluent with added bef after running the fe2 in sludge was 10 61 mg l in r5gbfda uasb due to bfda was located in sludge layer there was more fe2 and fe3 than effluent moreover bef reinforced fec reaction and released more fe2 it achieved 17 3 mg l and 27 66 mg l in rmfc 5gbfda uasb and rmfc 8gbfda uasb respectively previous studies showed that fe2 at low concentration could enhance microbial growth and agglomeration zhang et al 2018 thus a stable microbial population structure was observed to some extent the xps spectra of sludge after operating was combined with the iron ion concentration to analysis the variation of iron morphology see fig 6 it revealed that the surface of sludge in the four reactors contained mainly c and o with trace amounts of fe fig 6a due to the iron content was lower high resolution xps spectra of o 1s was highlighted to determine the oxidation state of leached fe fig 6b three common peaks of o 1s were all found for the four reactors the peak at around 532 2 and 532 8ev belonging to co coo and coh bond respectively which from organics the peak at around 531 5ev was assigned to the hydroxyl on the surface of iron oxide or hydroxide such as feooh or fe oh 3 it indicated that the surface of iron oxide coordination unsaturation and binding water molecules to generate feooh by comparing the peak area of feooh the intensity of feooh bond increased dramatically with bef catalyzed and bfda increased in addition one peak at around 530ev which attributed to feo bond was observed in rmfc 3gbfda uasb rmfc 5gbfda uasb and rmfc 8gbfda uasb due to h and o2 byproducts were produced in icme and produced iron oxides overall the xps confirms that few fe was adsorbed to the surface of sludge and likely present as oxide or hydroxide surface precipitates the mechanisms for removing organic pollutants in mfc bfda uasb include both physical processes and biochemical processes generally microbial degradation was accepted as the dominant process which intensified by icme nonetheless the adsorption and precipitation of iron oxides in bfda was considered another important removal pathway for studying the effect of bef on the iron forms the structure and morphology variation of bdfa was characterized see fig 6c xrd analyzed that the following peaks 104 110 113 024 and 116 which corresponding to the diffraction peaks in α fe2o3 the peak of 220 and 311 corresponding to fe3o4 was observed indicating that fresh bfda was consisted of α fe2o3 and fe3o4 and has high degree of crystallinity however very wide diffraction peaks were displayed at 30 6 33 2 and 35 6 after running in the four reactors except rmfc 5gbfda uasb the relative intensities of the peaks were greatly diminished indicating poorly crystallized precipitates obtained it might be attributed to the competing results of organic acid and hydroxyl groups to form polymorphic amorphous fe oh 3 gao et al 2018 and the bef might stimulate the inner fe2 and fe3 ions of the fe3o4 diffused outward to form fe2o3 crystals continuously in rmfc 5gbfda uasb formation of ferric hydroxide coating on the iron surface started to block electron transfer and caused deactivation of iron surfaces this gradually reduced the occurrence of electrochemical reactions the deconvoluted high resolution xps spectra of fe 2p peak for bfda was carried out to further demonstrate the effect of bef on iron oxide fig 6d images showed the xps peaks of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 core level electrons for the bfda which approached 711ev and 724ev corresponding to the 2p electron orbit of iron atom in fe3o4 and 712ev and 725ev corresponding to 2p electron orbit in fe2o3 jiang et al 2011 the absence of the satellite peak situated at about 719ev which is a characteristic of fe3 in fe2o3 of these peaks the area of fe 2p peak in rmfc 5gbfda uasb was greater than that of in other reactors indicated that the content of fe2o3 and fe3o4 was higher and be conductive to absorb and precipitate therefore the bef was benefit to promote the synergistic effect of hematite and magnetite however there are some risks in using much bfda due to excessive ferric ions being toxic to microorganism hazards should be avoided through a rational control of bfda on the other hand only few mg and si were detected in effluent which below 1 mg l and 0 2 mg l respectively and none of toxic detected which satisfied the integrated wastewater discharge standard in china gb 8978 1996 thus ensuring bfda is effective and will not cause secondary pollution to the environment 4 conclusion a novel and cost effect approach for effective enhance anaerobic digestion was developed via bef which generated by mfc supplied to bfda combined with uasb the experimental findings showed that bef catalyzed bfda improved the cod removal rate and biogas production the synergistic effect in this process not only bef stimulated numerous microscopic galvanic cells formulated on icme for intensified diet but also strengthened the activities of methanogens and acetogens and achieved ultra fast acidogenesis thereby enhancing organic compounds degradation this research has provided promising manner and information to enhance anaerobic digestion and recycled functionalized waste effectively

19148,the present work addresses the synthesis of nanofiltration composite membranes with bactericide properties the cellulose acetate based membranes with polyvinylpyrrolidone coated silver nanoparticles silver ion exchanged β zeolite and β zeolite are casted by the phase inversion technique and subjected to an annealing post treatment they are characterized in terms of the nanofiltration permeation performance and antibacterial properties the incorporation of silver nanoparticles produces a threefold increase in the membrane hydraulic permeability when compared to the silver free membranes and the incorporation of silver ion loaded zeolite resulted in a 56 3 increase in hydraulic permeability in contrast to the influence of silver presence either in nanometric or in the ionic form the presence of zeolite does not significantly influence the hydraulic permeability the rejection coefficients to salts range from 83 to 93 for the silver ion exchanged zeolite membrane and from 84 to 97 for the polyvinylpyrrolidone coated silver nanoparticles membrane they are higher for sulfate salts than for chloride salts the antibacterial properties of the membranes were evaluated against escherichia coli the results have shown that the silver ion exchanged β zeolite membrane was effective in inactivating escherichia coli after just 210 min of contact time no bacterial activity was detected following 24 h of contact time with the membrane containing polyvinylpyrrolidone coated silver nanoparticles a reduction of more than 6 log in the number of escherichia coli was achieved for both membranes the different patterns of bactericide activity are associated to the silver speciation in metallic or ionic form the high flux nanofiltration composite membranes

yeast extract agar cfu colony forming units 1 introduction membrane fouling is a major issue in pressure driven membrane processes and it is of paramount importance in dictating their implementation at large scale both technologically and economically membrane fouling encompasses inorganic fouling colloidal fouling and organic fouling that includes microbial fouling also known as biofouling amy 2008 biofouling has been known to contribute to more than 45 of all membrane fouling and is a major issue in nanofiltration nf komlenic 2010 vrouwenvelder and van der kooij 2003 there is currently an intense research on the use of nanomaterials to enhance the performance of conventional membranes and given the large number of nf applications at the industrial scale the association of nanotechnology with membrane processes should be evaluated by considering not only the performance enhancement as water permeability and solute selectivity but also commercial readiness including costs and existence of manufacturing infrastructures pendergast and hoek 2011 in fact the membrane casting by the phase inversion technique may envisage the larger scale manufacturing and most important of all provides a great versatility on the creation of casting solutions that incorporate bactericide agents and allow the tailoring of new membrane composite nanostructures in a study by liu et al 2017 the bactericidal effect of silver nanoparticles prepared in situ over composite membranes was evaluated nonetheless since non coated silver nanoparticles were prepared directly in the membrane surface the leaching of silver occurred largely the literature review points out different strategies to incorporate nanoparticles into polymeric membranes by incorporating the silver nanoparticles in the casting solution ex situ or promoting the formation of silver nanoparticles in the casting solution in situ the latter has been object of a very extensive and in depth review by li et al 2017 these authors analyze the advances and concerns of the in situ technique and point out the cost as a major limiting factor for the large scale use of this technology a common difficulty that several authors reported in their studies regarding the incorporation of nanoparticles either ex situ or in situ was the silver leaching from the polymeric matrix in general more pronounced to higher silver contents basri et al 2011 2010 cao and liu 2010 chou et al 2005 yu et al 2003 zodrow et al 2009 it was found that the addition of polyvinylpyrrolidone to the casting solutions resulted in a significant decrease in the silver leaching from the polymeric matrix being this effect more pronounced for polyvinylpyrrolidone with high molecular weight basri et al 2011 2010 figueiredo et al 2014 prepared ultrafiltration uf composite membranes with polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp coated silver nanoparticles well dispersed and non agglomerated in the polymeric matrix of cellulose acetate ca as scanning electron micrographs evidenced moreover the membrane permeation tests allowed the conclusion of minimal occurrence of silver leaching to the permeate 5 9 ppb this value is well below the value for silver in drinking water stated by the world health organization who without risk to human health which is 100 ppb in spite of the large number of publications on the already known bactericidal effect of silver nanoparticles the mechanisms of action of silver nanoparticles as antimicrobial agents are still a theme of scientific debate particularly on the question of the specific role of the metallic nanoparticle or the indirect effect by release of silver ions through particle oxidation choi et al 2008 fewtrell 2014 kim et al 2009 xiu et al 2012 2011 after release silver ions can bind to functional groups of enzymes and proteins that contain sulfur creating serious damage to several functions within the bacterial cell lalley et al 2014 additionally the formation of reactive oxidation species ros may also occur as a result of exposure of silver nanoparticles to oxygen chen et al 2007 fauss et al 2014 he et al 2012 ros can act as an oxidizer of important bacterial elements such as proteins enzymes and even to the dna mendis et al 2005 a study conducted by liu et al 2017 demonstrated an elevated antibacterial activity by silver nanoparticles nucleated in situ in the membrane surface the authors attributed this activity to the oxidation of silver nanoparticles to silver ions zeolites and chemically treated zeolites are also recognized as potential bactericides and with particular interest are the silver ion exchanged zeolites abbaszadegan et al 2006 mumpton 1999 the numerous charge sites on the surface of zeolites are available for ion exchange making silver ions exchanged zeolites an excellent source for the direct release of ag and therefore potentiating the bactericidal activity the structural characteristics of cellulose acetate are a strong asset on the well known use of an annealing treatment to produce ca nanofiltration membranes from ca ultrafiltration membranes de pinho 1988 the present work investigates the permeation properties and the bactericide activity of novel nanofiltration cellulose acetate composite membranes that are synthesized by annealing of ultrafiltration membranes prepared from casting solutions incorporating silver in two distinct forms polyvinylpyrrolidone coated silver nanoparticles agnps and silver ion exchanged β zeolite ag βz this will contribute to correlate the nanometric ionic silver speciation with the bactericide performance as there is lack of literature on the use of silver ion exchanged zeolites as a source of direct release of silver ions with bactericide activity 2 materials and

out under sonication stable dispersions of silver nanoparticles were obtained and characterized by presenting a silver surface plasmon resonance band at 408 nm this typical value of nanometric silver remains after 5 days of storage in the refrigerator the absorption spectra were recorded using an uv vis spectrophotometer uv 1700 pharmaspec shimadzu 2 3 preparation of zeolite β βz and silver loaded zeolite β ag βz zeolite β βz is a cation exchanger with a sio2 al2o3 mole ratio of 25 and a surface area of 680 m2 g zeolite β used in the preparation of βz cellulose acetate membranes ca βz casting solution was previously calcinated at 500 c in a muffle furnace to prepare the silver loaded zeolite β cellulose acetate membranes ca ag βz it was necessary to exchange first the ammonia cations present in the βz with silver ions hence the βz 4 g and an aqueous solution of silver nitrate 80 ml 0 07 mol l were mixed and stirred magnetic stirrer at 600 rpm during 24 h without exposure to light after 24 h the suspension was filtrated and purged with deionized water the silver content was determined in the initial solution of silver nitrate in the filtrate and in the purging water by titration using the mohr s method skoog et al 1996 the ag βz was dried in an oven at 80 c for 12 h afterwards it was calcinated in a muffle furnace at 500 c for 5 h 2 4 membranes preparation ca ca agnps ca βz and ca ag βz flat sheet membranes were prepared by the phase inversion method as described previously kunst and sourirajan 1974 and correspond to membranes of cellulose acetate cellulose acetate with silver nanoparticles cellulose acetate with β zeolite and cellulose acetate with β zeolite loaded with silver ions respectively the casting solutions were prepared at room temperature according to the compositions and conditions presented in table 1 the ca casting solutions were prepared with the following sequence of addition cellulose acetate formamide and acetone to prepare the ca agnps ca βz and ca ag βz casting solutions the silver nanoparticles the βz and ag βz respectively were introduced in the acetone solution the flasks were capped and in order to obtain homogenous solutions they were shaken for at least 12 h in a mechanical shaker vibromatic selecta the flasks containing the ca agnps and ca ag βz casting solutions were covered with aluminium foil to prevent exposure to light the casting solutions were cast on a clean glass plate using a casting knife with the gate height fixed at 0 25 mm the plate after 30 s was immersed in ice cold water during 1 2 h to prepare the ca βz casting solution the β zeolite was calcinated at 500 c before being added to the acetone solution to be then incorporated in the mixture of cellulose acetate and formamide the preparation of ca ag βz casting solution involves a first step of preparing a β zeolite loaded with silver ions which was achieved by ion exchange with a silver nitrate solution the incorporation of ag βz in the casting solution was performed as previously described for the incorporation of silver nanoparticles and β zeolite all membranes were annealed in a bath of deionized water with a constant temperature of 95 c during 11 min de pinho 1988 2 5 membrane surface zeta potential the zeta potential was determined with a eka electro kinetic analyzer anton paar graz austria between ph 4 and ph 9 with 0 001m kcl solutions and pressures up to 500 mbar the ph value between the runs was manually adjusted with 0 1n hcl and 0 1n naoh in the automatized measuring procedure the cell and bypass were rinsed for 60 s and 30 s respectively at 300 mbar subsequently the measurement was started and the pressure was raised from 0 to 500 mbar in 120 s for 3 times in each flow direction 2 6 permeation experiments the permeations experiments were performed in a crossflow filtration set up fig 1 that consists of a feed tank a pump flowmeter two manometers six flat plate cells with two detachable parts separated by a porous plate membrane support with a membrane surface area of 13 2 cm2 and a pressure control valve as previously described afonso and de pinho 1990 before the experiments membranes were compacted for 8 h at 40 bar 20 higher than the maximum operating pressure the membranes were characterized in terms of pure water permeation fluxes hydraulic permeability and separation performance in terms of apparent rejection coefficients for glucose nacl na2so4 mgcl2 and mgso4 the pure water fluxes were measured at a feed flow rate of 36 l h and at pressures of 5 10 15 25 30 and 33 bar the hydraulic permeability is obtained by the slope of the straight line of pure water permeate fluxes as a function of the transmembrane pressure the apparent solute rejection coefficients f are defined as f cf cp cf where cf and cp are the solute concentrations in the bulk of the feed solution and of the permeate solution respectively all experiments were conducted individually for one solute with an initial feed concentration of 2 g l a feed pressure of 30 bar and a feed flow rate of 36 l h the glucose concentrations in the feed and in permeate were determined in terms of total organic carbon toc content by a dohrmann total organic carbon analyzer model dc 85a and the salts concentration determined by conductivity measurements using a crison conductimeter glp 32 2 7 membrane antibacterial properties the antibacterial properties of membranes were tested against e coli strain atcc 700078 also known as wg5 e coli was grown in nutrient broth nb at 37 c with orbital shaking 200 rpm until the exponential growth phase was reached bacteriological tests were conducted in nb medium with the three distinct membranes ca agnps ca βz and ca ag βz all the results were compared to the control the pristine membrane ca all assays were performed in duplicate prior to incubation with the bacterial strain each side of the tested membranes was sterilized for 30 min under the uv light following sterilization the membranes were placed in contact with a solution containing 9 ml of sterilized distilled water and 1 ml of the exponential growth phase culture of e coli in nutrient broth medium the membranes were incubated at 37 c with orbital shaking 200 rpm for 22 h the study concept called for samples to be taken every 15 min during the first 3 h to be taken each 30 min in the next 3 h a final sample was taken after 22 h of incubation to validate the bactericidal effect of the membranes in each point taken 0 1 ml of the direct sample and several dilutions 10 2 10 4 10 5 and 10 6 were analyzed on yeast extract agar yea the plates were incubated at 36 c for 24 h and the number of colonies was counted 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanofiltration permeation performance the synthetized membranes were characterized in terms of pure water flux and selective permeation to different solutes the nanofiltration composite membranes designated by ca agnps ca βz and ca ag βz were always compared to the cellulose acetate nanofiltration membrane fig 2 displays the linear variation of pure water permeation fluxes with the transmembrane pressure for the ca ca agnps ca βz and ca ag βz membranes the slope of the corresponding straight lines yields the membrane hydraulic permeability insert in fig 2 the incorporation of silver nanoparticles produces a threefold increase in the hydraulic permeability of the ca agnps membranes when compared to the silver free ca membranes also the incorporation of a silver ion exchanged β zeolite resulted in a 56 3 increase of the ca ag βz membrane hydraulic permeability in comparison to the ca silver free membrane in contrast to the influence of silver presence either in nanometric or in the ionic form the presence of zeolite in the membrane matrix which is the case of ca βz does not significantly influence its hydraulic permeability as shown in fig 3 the ca ca agnps and ca ag βz membranes present high rejection coefficients to glucose 98 8 89 6 and 84 6 respectively this is in contrast with the lower value of 43 6 presented by the ca βz membrane as the permeation of a neutral solute like glucose is mainly ruled by steric hindrances one can conclude that the incorporation of fillers resulted in different porous network structures favoring the passage of this small organic solute this is more pronounced for the membrane with zeolite as for the selective permeation to aqueous solutions of salts nacl na2so4 mgcl2 and mgso4 the membranes incorporating nanometric or ionic silver present a surface zeta potential more negative than the one of the caβz and ca membranes as shown in fig 4 this feature may be responsible for the membrane differentiation of divalent anions from monovalent ones in fact the rejection coefficients of ca ag βz membranes to sulfate salts na2so4 and mgso4 are 92 5 and 93 3 respectively and to chloride salts nacl and mgcl2 are 82 8 and 86 5 respectively the ca agnps membranes have rejections coefficients for sulfate salts na2so4 and mgso4 of 96 4 and 97 4 respectively whereas the rejection coefficients for chloride salts nacl and mgcl2 are 83 5 and 90 4 the ca βz membranes as shown in fig 3 display this difference in an overall lower range of rejections na2so4 78 mgso4 71 3 and nacl 44 7 mgcl2 45 5 3 2 antimicrobial properties of the nanofiltration composite membranes to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of the membranes pristine ca ca agnps ca βz and ca ag βz membranes were incubated in the presence of e coli used as the sensitive indicator strain in nb broth for 24 h as the initial concentration of e coli was slightly different at every experiment to make the results comparable the initial number of colony forming units cfu was counted and set as 100 the results over the time were converted in percentage relating to the base of the initial cfu number ca composite membranes containing agnps ca agnps were able to reduce the number of attached e coli cells by 99 95 whereas complete inactivation was achieved with ca ag βz membranes following just 210 min of contact time fig 5 on the other hand at a contact time of 210 min with the membrane containing silver nanoparticles ca agnps e coli was still viable although no culturable bacteria was detected after 24 h ca βz incorporating only zeolite did not affect the viability of bacterial cells to the membrane showing no significant difference throughout the different contact times ρ 0 05 indicating that this membrane exhibits a bacteriostatic effect as demonstrated in fig 5 erdogan and ulku 2013 therefore there is a clear evidence that the incorporation of silver ion exchanged zeolites ag βz and polyvinylpyrrolidone coated silver nanoparticles agnps provides a deep strong antimicrobial property to ca membranes the activity of ca agnps membranes may be the result of the slow release of silver ions from a agnps surface oxidation layer the release pattern depends on the solution chemistry ph redox potential other ions or molecules the protection provided by the pvp coating and the polymer structure but particle specific biological effects xiu et al 2012 cannot be ruled out on the other hand for the ca ag βz membranes fig 5 shows a faster inhibitory effect compared to the membrane containing the pvp stabilized nanoparticles this may result from an easier release of the silver ions from the zeolite and therefore being more readily available to inactivate the bacteria 4 conclusion the nanofiltration composite membranes incorporating silver nanoparticles or silver ion exchanged zeolites exhibited bactericide properties with distinct features upon silver speciation in the metallic or ionic form the composite membrane incorporating silver ion exchanged zeolite exhibited complete bacterial inactivation at 210 min of contact time and in the case of the one incorporating silver nanoparticles there was a 99 95 reduction of the bacterial activity at the same contact time the composite nanofiltration membranes displayed enhanced hydraulic permeability and higher rejection coefficients to sulfate salts when compared to chloride salts the combination of nanofiltration composite membranes with high fluxes and bactericidal effect may envisage the mitigation of biofouling in the nanofiltration water treatment acknowledgments the authors are grateful to fct fundação

19148,the present work addresses the synthesis of nanofiltration composite membranes with bactericide properties the cellulose acetate based membranes with polyvinylpyrrolidone coated silver nanoparticles silver ion exchanged β zeolite and β zeolite are casted by the phase inversion technique and subjected to an annealing post treatment they are characterized in terms of the nanofiltration permeation performance and antibacterial properties the incorporation of silver nanoparticles produces a threefold increase in the membrane hydraulic permeability when compared to the silver free membranes and the incorporation of silver ion loaded zeolite resulted in a 56 3 increase in hydraulic permeability in contrast to the influence of silver presence either in nanometric or in the ionic form the presence of zeolite does not significantly influence the hydraulic permeability the rejection coefficients to salts range from 83 to 93 for the silver ion exchanged zeolite membrane and from 84 to 97 for the polyvinylpyrrolidone coated silver nanoparticles membrane they are higher for sulfate salts than for chloride salts the antibacterial properties of the membranes were evaluated against escherichia coli the results have shown that the silver ion exchanged β zeolite membrane was effective in inactivating escherichia coli after just 210 min of contact time no bacterial activity was detected following 24 h of contact time with the membrane containing polyvinylpyrrolidone coated silver nanoparticles a reduction of more than 6 log in the number of escherichia coli was achieved for both membranes the different patterns of bactericide activity are associated to the silver speciation in metallic or ionic form the high flux nanofiltration composite membranes

at large scale both technologically and economically membrane fouling encompasses inorganic fouling colloidal fouling and organic fouling that includes microbial fouling also known as biofouling amy 2008 biofouling has been known to contribute to more than 45 of all membrane fouling and is a major issue in nanofiltration nf komlenic 2010 vrouwenvelder and van der kooij 2003 there is currently an intense research on the use of nanomaterials to enhance the performance of conventional membranes and given the large number of nf applications at the industrial scale the association of nanotechnology with membrane processes should be evaluated by considering not only the performance enhancement as water permeability and solute selectivity but also commercial readiness including costs and existence of manufacturing infrastructures pendergast and hoek 2011 in fact the membrane casting by the phase inversion technique may envisage the larger scale manufacturing and most important of all provides a great versatility on the creation of casting solutions that incorporate bactericide agents and allow the tailoring of new membrane composite nanostructures in a study by liu et al 2017 the bactericidal effect of silver nanoparticles prepared in situ over composite membranes was evaluated nonetheless since non coated silver nanoparticles were prepared directly in the membrane surface the leaching of silver occurred largely the literature review points out different strategies to incorporate nanoparticles into polymeric membranes by incorporating the silver nanoparticles in the casting solution ex situ or promoting the formation of silver nanoparticles in the casting solution in situ the latter has been object of a very extensive and in depth review by li et al 2017 these authors analyze the advances and concerns of the in situ technique and point out the cost as a major limiting factor for the large scale use of this technology a common difficulty that several authors reported in their studies regarding the incorporation of nanoparticles either ex situ or in situ was the silver leaching from the polymeric matrix in general more pronounced to higher silver contents basri et al 2011 2010 cao and liu 2010 chou et al 2005 yu et al 2003 zodrow et al 2009 it was found that the addition of polyvinylpyrrolidone to the casting solutions resulted in a significant decrease in the silver leaching from the polymeric matrix being this effect more pronounced for polyvinylpyrrolidone with high molecular weight basri et al 2011 2010 figueiredo et al 2014 prepared ultrafiltration uf composite membranes with polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp coated silver nanoparticles well dispersed and non agglomerated in the polymeric matrix of cellulose acetate ca as scanning electron micrographs evidenced moreover the membrane permeation tests allowed the conclusion of minimal occurrence of silver leaching to the permeate 5 9 ppb this value is well below the value for silver in drinking water stated by the world health organization who without risk to human health which is 100 ppb in spite of the large number of publications on the already known bactericidal effect of silver nanoparticles the mechanisms of action of silver nanoparticles as antimicrobial agents are still a theme of scientific debate particularly on the question of the specific role of the metallic nanoparticle or the indirect effect by release of silver ions through particle oxidation choi et al 2008 fewtrell 2014 kim et al 2009 xiu et al 2012 2011 after release silver ions can bind to functional groups of enzymes and proteins that contain sulfur creating serious damage to several functions within the bacterial cell lalley et al 2014 additionally the formation of reactive oxidation species ros may also occur as a result of exposure of silver nanoparticles to oxygen chen et al 2007 fauss et al 2014 he et al 2012 ros can act as an oxidizer of important bacterial elements such as proteins enzymes and even to the dna mendis et al 2005 a study conducted by liu et al 2017 demonstrated an elevated antibacterial activity by silver nanoparticles nucleated in situ in the membrane surface the authors attributed this activity to the oxidation of silver nanoparticles to silver ions zeolites and chemically treated zeolites are also recognized as potential bactericides and with particular interest are the silver ion exchanged zeolites abbaszadegan et al 2006 mumpton 1999 the numerous charge sites on the surface of zeolites are available for ion exchange making silver ions exchanged zeolites an excellent source for the direct release of ag and therefore potentiating the bactericidal activity the structural characteristics of cellulose acetate are a strong asset on the well known use of an annealing treatment to produce ca nanofiltration membranes from ca ultrafiltration membranes de pinho 1988 the present work investigates the permeation properties and the bactericide activity of novel nanofiltration cellulose acetate composite membranes that are synthesized by annealing of ultrafiltration membranes prepared from casting solutions incorporating silver in two distinct forms polyvinylpyrrolidone coated silver nanoparticles agnps and silver ion exchanged β zeolite ag βz this will contribute to correlate the nanometric ionic silver speciation with the bactericide performance as there is lack of literature on the use of silver ion exchanged zeolites as a source of direct release of silver ions with bactericide activity 2 materials and

out under sonication stable dispersions of silver nanoparticles were obtained and characterized by presenting a silver surface plasmon resonance band at 408 nm this typical value of nanometric silver

zeolite β ag βz zeolite β βz is a cation exchanger with a sio2 al2o3 mole ratio of 25 and a surface area of 680 m2 g zeolite β used in the preparation of βz cellulose acetate membranes ca βz casting solution was previously calcinated at 500 c in a muffle furnace to prepare the silver loaded zeolite β cellulose acetate membranes ca ag βz it was necessary to exchange first the ammonia cations present in the βz with silver ions hence the βz 4 g and an aqueous solution of silver nitrate 80 ml 0 07 mol l were mixed and stirred magnetic stirrer at 600 rpm during 24 h without exposure to light after 24 h the suspension was filtrated and purged with deionized water the silver content was determined in the initial solution of silver nitrate in the filtrate and in the purging water by titration using the mohr s method skoog et al 1996 the ag βz was dried in an oven at 80 c for 12 h afterwards it was calcinated in a muffle furnace at 500 c for 5 h 2 4 membranes preparation ca ca agnps ca βz and ca ag βz flat sheet membranes were prepared by the phase inversion method as described previously kunst and sourirajan 1974 and correspond to membranes of cellulose acetate cellulose acetate with silver nanoparticles cellulose acetate with β zeolite and cellulose acetate with β zeolite loaded with silver ions respectively the casting solutions were prepared at room temperature according to the compositions and conditions presented in table 1 the ca casting solutions were prepared with the following sequence of addition cellulose acetate formamide and acetone to prepare the ca agnps ca βz and ca ag βz casting solutions the silver nanoparticles the βz and ag βz respectively were introduced in the acetone solution the flasks were capped and in order to obtain homogenous solutions they were shaken for at least 12 h in a mechanical shaker vibromatic selecta the flasks containing the ca agnps and ca ag βz casting solutions were covered with aluminium foil to prevent exposure to light the casting solutions were cast on a clean glass plate using a casting knife with the gate height fixed at 0 25 mm the plate after 30 s was immersed in ice cold water during 1 2 h to prepare the ca βz casting solution the β zeolite was calcinated at 500 c before being added to the acetone solution to be then incorporated in the mixture of cellulose acetate and formamide the preparation of ca ag βz casting solution involves a first step of preparing a β zeolite loaded with silver ions which was achieved by ion exchange with a silver nitrate solution the incorporation of ag βz in the casting solution was performed as previously described for the incorporation of silver nanoparticles and β zeolite all membranes were annealed in a bath of deionized water with a constant temperature of 95 c during 11 min de pinho 1988 2 5 membrane surface zeta potential the zeta potential was determined with a eka electro kinetic analyzer anton paar graz austria between ph 4 and ph 9 with 0 001m kcl solutions and pressures up to 500 mbar the ph value between the runs was manually adjusted with 0 1n hcl and 0 1n naoh in the automatized measuring procedure the cell and bypass were rinsed for 60 s and 30 s respectively at 300 mbar subsequently the measurement was started and the pressure was raised from 0 to 500 mbar in 120 s for 3 times in each flow direction 2 6 permeation experiments the permeations experiments were performed in a crossflow filtration set up fig 1 that consists of a feed tank a pump flowmeter two manometers six flat plate cells with two detachable parts separated by a porous plate membrane support with a membrane surface area of 13 2 cm2 and a pressure control valve as previously described afonso and de pinho 1990 before the experiments membranes were compacted for 8 h at 40 bar 20 higher than the maximum operating pressure the membranes were characterized in terms of pure water permeation fluxes hydraulic permeability and separation performance in terms of apparent rejection coefficients for glucose nacl na2so4 mgcl2 and mgso4 the pure water fluxes were measured at a feed flow rate of 36 l h and at pressures of 5 10 15 25 30 and 33 bar the hydraulic permeability is obtained by the slope of the straight line of pure water permeate fluxes as a function of the transmembrane pressure the apparent solute rejection coefficients f are defined as f cf cp cf where cf and cp are the solute concentrations in the bulk of the feed solution and of the permeate solution respectively all experiments were conducted individually for one solute with an initial feed concentration of 2 g l a feed pressure of 30 bar and a feed flow rate of 36 l h the glucose concentrations in the feed and in permeate were determined in terms of total organic carbon toc content by a dohrmann total organic carbon analyzer model dc 85a and the salts concentration determined by conductivity measurements using a crison conductimeter glp 32 2 7 membrane antibacterial properties the antibacterial properties of membranes were tested against e coli strain atcc 700078 also known as wg5 e coli was grown in nutrient broth nb at 37 c with orbital shaking 200 rpm until the exponential growth phase was reached bacteriological tests were conducted in nb medium with the three distinct membranes ca agnps ca βz and ca ag βz all the results were compared to the control the pristine membrane ca all assays were performed in duplicate prior to incubation with the bacterial strain each side of the tested membranes was sterilized for 30 min under the uv light following sterilization the membranes were placed in contact with a solution containing 9 ml of sterilized distilled water and 1 ml of the exponential growth phase culture of e coli in nutrient broth medium the membranes were incubated at 37 c with orbital shaking 200 rpm for 22 h the study concept called for samples to be taken every 15 min during the first 3 h to be taken each 30 min in the next 3 h a final sample was taken after 22 h of incubation to validate the bactericidal effect of the membranes in each point taken 0 1 ml of the direct sample and several dilutions 10 2 10 4 10 5 and 10 6 were analyzed on yeast extract agar yea the plates were incubated at 36 c for 24 h and the number of colonies was counted 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanofiltration permeation performance the synthetized membranes were characterized in terms of pure water flux and selective permeation to different solutes the nanofiltration composite membranes designated by ca agnps ca βz and ca ag βz were always compared to the cellulose acetate nanofiltration membrane fig 2 displays the linear variation of pure water permeation fluxes with the transmembrane pressure for the ca ca agnps ca βz and ca ag βz membranes the slope of the corresponding straight lines yields the membrane hydraulic permeability insert in fig 2 the incorporation of silver nanoparticles produces a threefold increase in the hydraulic permeability of the ca agnps membranes when compared to the silver free ca membranes also the incorporation of a silver ion exchanged β zeolite resulted in a 56 3 increase of the ca ag βz membrane hydraulic permeability in comparison to the ca silver free membrane in contrast to the influence of silver presence either in nanometric or in the ionic form the presence of zeolite in the membrane matrix which is the case of ca βz does not significantly influence its hydraulic permeability as shown in fig 3 the ca ca agnps and ca ag βz membranes present high rejection coefficients to glucose 98 8 89 6 and 84 6 respectively this is in contrast with the lower value of 43 6 presented by the ca βz membrane as the permeation of a neutral solute like glucose is mainly ruled by steric hindrances one can conclude that the incorporation of fillers resulted in different porous network structures favoring the passage of this small organic solute this is more pronounced for the membrane with zeolite as for the selective permeation to aqueous solutions of salts nacl na2so4 mgcl2 and mgso4 the membranes incorporating nanometric or ionic silver present a surface zeta potential more negative than the one of the caβz and ca membranes as shown in fig 4 this feature may be responsible for the membrane differentiation of divalent anions from monovalent ones in fact the rejection coefficients of ca ag βz membranes to sulfate salts na2so4 and mgso4 are 92 5 and 93 3 respectively and to chloride salts nacl and mgcl2 are 82 8 and 86 5 respectively the ca agnps membranes have rejections coefficients for sulfate salts na2so4 and mgso4 of 96 4 and 97 4 respectively whereas the rejection coefficients for chloride salts nacl and mgcl2 are 83 5 and 90 4 the ca βz membranes as shown in fig 3 display this difference in an overall lower range of rejections na2so4 78 mgso4 71 3 and nacl 44 7 mgcl2 45 5 3 2 antimicrobial properties of the nanofiltration composite membranes to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of the membranes pristine ca ca agnps ca βz and ca ag βz membranes were incubated in the presence of e coli used as the sensitive indicator strain in nb broth for 24 h as the initial concentration of e coli was slightly different at every experiment to make the results comparable the initial number of colony forming units cfu was counted and set as 100 the results over the time were converted in percentage relating to the base of the initial cfu number ca composite membranes containing agnps ca agnps were able to reduce the number of attached e coli cells by 99 95 whereas complete inactivation was achieved with ca ag βz membranes following just 210 min of contact time fig 5 on the other hand at a contact time of 210 min with the membrane containing silver nanoparticles ca agnps e coli was still viable although no culturable bacteria was detected after 24 h ca βz incorporating only zeolite did not affect the viability of bacterial cells to the membrane showing no significant difference throughout the different contact times ρ 0 05 indicating that this membrane exhibits a bacteriostatic effect as demonstrated in fig 5 erdogan and ulku 2013 therefore there is a clear evidence that the incorporation of silver ion exchanged zeolites ag βz and polyvinylpyrrolidone coated silver nanoparticles agnps provides a deep strong antimicrobial property to ca

19149,the membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr is a novel wastewater treatment technology based on oxygen supplying membranes the counter diffusion of oxygen and electron donors in mabrs leads to unique behavior and we hypothesized it also could impact predation we used optical coherence tomography oct microsensor analyses and mathematical modeling to investigate predation in membrane aerated biofilms mabs when protozoa were excluded from the inoculum the mab s oct observable void fraction was around 5 when protozoa were included the void fraction grew to nearly 50 with large continuous voids at the base of the biofilm real time oct imaging showed highly motile protozoa in the voids mabs with protozoa and a high bulk cod 270 mg l only had 4 void fraction dna sequencing revealed a high relative abundance of amoeba in both high and low cod mabs flagellates were only abundant in the low cod mab modeling also suggested a relationship between substrate concentrations diffusion mode co or counter diffusion and biofilm void fraction results suggest that amoeba proliferate in the biofilm interior especially in the aerobic zones voids form once cod limitation at the base of mabs allows predation rates to exceed microbial growth rates once formed the voids provide a niche for motile protozoa which expand the voids into a large continuous gap this increases the potential for biofilm sloughing and may have detrimental effects on slow growing aerobic microorganisms such as nitrifying bacteria graphical abstract image 1 keywords mabr biofilm protozoa predation voids porosity 1 introduction membrane aerated biofilm reactors mabrs are a novel wastewater treatment technology based on air or oxygen supplying membranes the membranes deliver oxygen directly to biofilms growing on the membrane outer surface achieving up to 100 percent oxygen transfer efficiency ahmed et al 2004 martin and nerenberg 2012 pankhania et al 1994 perez calleja et al 2017 semmens et al 2005 interest in mabrs has increased significantly in recent years this is partly due to the launch of several commercial mabr applications peeters et al 2017 in order to develop effective mabr applications a fundamental understanding of the behavior of mabr biofilms mabs is needed mabs behave differently from conventional or conventionally aerated biofilms cabs due to the counter diffusion of the electron donor and acceptor nerenberg 2016 for example cabs have the highest dissolved oxygen do and cod concentrations at the biofilm exterior fig 1 a thus their highest metabolic activity always is at the biofilm exterior in mabs in contrast the do penetrates from the base of the biofilm so the highest activity can occur anywhere in the biofilm fig 1b nerenberg 2016 this can lead to differences in biofilm microbial community morphology and activity downing and nerenberg 2008 2007 matsumoto et al 2007 pellicer nàcher and smets 2014 our research was motivated by the observation of large voids at the base of heterotrophic mabs totally disconnected from the bulk liquid these voids were absent from cabs grown under similar conditions the voids appeared after a few days and quickly expanded to form near continuous gaps along the base of the mabs no previous research reported similar phenomena in this paper we refer to biofilm voids as empty biofilm spaces that lack connection to the bulk liquid we avoided the term porosity as its use commonly includes spaces connected to the bulk liquid we hypothesized that void formation in mabs resulted from protozoan predation as our real time imaging showed putative protozoa actively moving within these internal voids if true this could have important implications for the stability of mabs a better understanding of this phenomena could allow the development of strategies to encourage or discourage this phenomenon as needed predation by higher organisms is known to impact the structure and function of environmental biofilms although few studies have quantified predation within biofilms it has not been considered explicitly in past biofilm models common protozoa in wastewater systems include amoebae flagellates and ciliates jürgens and matz 2002 lee and welander 1996 madoni 2011 amoeba typically are predominant in biofilms arndt et al 2003 they establish themselves on or within biofilms and may significantly influence biofilm growth patterns and structure jackson and jones 1991 scherwass et al 2016 flagellates can glide over the biofilm exterior and feed on suspended or attached biomass arndt et al 2003 ciliates are able to walk over the substratum with their cilia they browse on loosely attached bacteria or suspended bacteria arndt et al 2003 protozoa can impact biofilms in a variety of ways for example protozoan metabolism can re mineralize nutrients and stimulate biofilm growth scherwass et al 2016 they also can disturb the initial stages of biofilm development rychert and neu 2011 protozoa can indirectly enhance solute transport in biofilms by their movement increasing porosity and causing morphological changes in the biofilm matrix böhme et al 2009 ciliates can modify biofilm internal structure by creating holes and channels driving the biomass morphology to grazing resistant microcolonies böhme et al 2009 dopheide et al 2011 or biofilm structures weitere et al 2005 amoeba can disrupt biofilms by moving through its matrix and grazing on biomass potentially causing biofilm sloughing jackson and jones 1991 and forming cavities derlon et al 2012 given that most protozoa prefer aerobic environments fenchel 2014 finlay 1990 and the aerobic zones differ between cabs and mabs the effects of predation may differ as well metazoa such as worms also have important effects on biofilms consuming biomass and creating rough biofilm morphologies at a macro scale derlon et al 2013 klein et al 2016 also some pure culture biofilms have been observed to hollow out the interior of mushroom structures reportedly due to starvation and degradation of eps hunt et al 2004 growth conditions and detachment can also affect the porosity of biofilms marchal et al 2011 despite these known effects there are no previous reports of large continuous voids forming entirely within the biofilm with no connection to the bulk liquid this research explores void formation in mabs the research strategy was to study mixed culture heterotrophic mabs with low bulk cod such that cod limitation occurred at the base of the biofilm controls included an mab inoculated without protozoa an mab with high bulk cod and a cab with low bulk cod studies included biofilm imaging with optical coherence tomography oct profiling with do microsensors and dna sequence analysis also mathematical modeling was used to qualitatively explain the mechanisms of void formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 biofilm growth experiments heterotrophic biofilms were grown in bench scale flow cells containing a single hollow fiber membrane fig 2 the flow cells were either operated as mabs or cabs for mab operation the bulk liquid was maintained anaerobic by recirculating the flow through a reservoir with n2 sparging the membrane lumen was pressurized with air for cab operation the recirculation reservoir was sparged with air providing a do of 5 0 2 mg l in the bulk liquid and the membrane lumen was pressurized with n2 allowing aerobic conditions in the outer part of the biofilm and anaerobic in the inner part air or n2 was supplied to the membrane at a relative pressure of 34 5 kpa 5 psig this pressure results in do concentration at the membrane surface about 8 10 mg l for the mab the air or n2 gas sparging was at approximately 15 ml min the effluent was pumped out of this reservoir from a fixed elevation in the reservoir maintaining a constant water level the flow cell was a square sectioned glass tube with a 6 mm inner dimension and 40 cm length with a single 460 μm diameter silicone hollow fiber membrane in the center oxymem ltd county westmeath ireland fig 2 the membrane was located at the bottom of the flow cell supported at both ends by an air supplying manifold the membrane was glued to a plastic support with the upper half exposed to the liquid and the bottom half embedded in glue fixing the membrane to the bottom of the flow cell minimized movement caused by the water flow and improved the oct imaging the other end of the membrane was open ended in all experiments the flow cell had seven ports located every 5 cm along the flow cell for microsensor do measurements a recirculation flow rate of 15 2 ml min resulting in a laminar flow of 0 01 m s re 70 provided well mixed conditions and hydraulic shear on the biofilm masterflex l s cole parmer no sloughing or

experimental conditions for the tests performed in this study is shown in table 1 the flow cell was operated at room temperature approximately 22 c it was inoculated with mixed liquor from a local wastewater treatment plant the plant was a conventional activated sludge plant with cod removal and nitrification and a solids retention time of around 10 days for the control test experiment 1 protozoa were removed by three filtration steps with 1 2 μm pore size filters isopore membrane filters millipore wey et al 2012 for the other tests the reactors were inoculated with 10 ml of the supernatant of mixed liquor that had been vigorously mixed and allowed to settle for 30 min the inoculated reactor was allowed to recirculate for 24 h before starting the influent flow which was considered the beginning of the experiment time zero from the time of inoculation the membrane lumen was pressurized with air and the bulk liquid was continuously sparged with n2 to prevent do accumulation see sparging bottle on the magnetic stirrer in fig 2 for the mab low and high cod concentrations were used to evaluate the effect of donor limiting conditions inside the biofilm all experiments were carried out over 80 100 h when the biofilms had reached a stable thickness 2 4 imaging of biofilm internal structure oct was used to image 2d vertical biofilm sections i e sections perpendicular to attachment surface ganymede ii spectral domain oct system thorlabs inc the image collection software was thorimage oct version 4 3 thorlabs inc www thorlabs com the biofilm flow cell was kept under the oct for the duration of each experiment and biofilm development and void formation were observed for a fixed location this location was 15 cm from the liquid and air inlet side of the reactor and covered approximately 6 7 mm of biofilm length the oct resolution was approximately 8 μm so the observed voids were only those larger than 10 μm fortunato et al 2017 wagner et al 2017 in our experiments both biofilm water and biofilm substratum interfaces were clearly detectable this is because the maximum biofilm thickness of around 250 μm allowed full oct penetration down to the membrane surface no shadowing effects were identified images were captured every 3 5 h real time imaging was collected over 10 20 s periods to visualize predator movement within the biofilm videos showing the movement of predators were made using imagej 1 50b wayne rasband national institutes of health usa a typical video is provided in the supplementary material the oct images were digitally processed to estimate biofilm thickness area and void fraction matlab programs matlab r2013a the mathworks inc were adapted from lewandowski and beyenal 2013 image processing included a digital correction of oct image including the deletion of background noise from raw oct captures and isolation of the biofilm structure b conversion of corrected image to a binary black and white format to allow post processing and parameter estimation the thresholding procedure used was the iterative selection method lewandowski and beyenal 2013 c estimation of void fraction area and thickness of the biofilm where void fraction is the number of internal void pixels disconnected from the bulk liquid divided by the total number of pixels void and biofilm biofilm area is the total number of pixels and biofilm average thickness is the biofilm area divided by the image length in the membrane direction all initial calculations were made in terms of pixels final results were transformed to metric units using scale data from oct software 2 5 do measurements oxygen microelectrodes were used to measure the do profiles in the biofilm profiles spanned from the membrane surface across the biofilm and into the bulk clark type oxygen microelectrodes unisense denmark with a 25 μm tip diameter were used to measure do concentrations at 20 μm intervals perpendicular to the membrane the microelectrode movement was controlled with a micro manipulator model mm33 2 unisense a s the do profiles typically reached a distance of around 600 1000 μm from the membrane surface into the bulk liquid each plotted do profile corresponds to the average of four replicates profiles made at different biofilm locations at a measuring port located 15 cm from the entrance of the flow cell do measurements were used to verify the location of aerobic and anaerobic areas within the biofilm and were matched with simulated oxygen profiles 2 6 dna extraction sequencing and data analysis total community dna was extracted from biofilm samples and the inoculum using the powersoil dna kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca a nanodrop spectrophotometer nanodrop 2000 thermo scientific was used to quantify the concentration and check the quality of the extracted dna primer sets 515f 926r walters et al 2016 and euk1391f euk br amaral zettler et al 2009 were used to amplify bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna gene v4 v5 variable region and eukaryotic 18s rrna v9 region respectively the pcr amplicons were purified using the ultraclean pcr clean up kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca to remove primer dimers and other non specific dna dna sequencing using illumina miseq with paired end reads was sequenced at the center for research informatics cri chicago il raw sequencing data were submitted to the ncbi sra database under the accession number srp 139044 sequences less than 250 bases were discarded subsequently chimeric sequences were checked and filtered using the usearch algorithm with the greengenes 13 8 reference sequence database mcdonald et al 2012 sequencing data was then processed and de novo operational taxonomic unit otu clusters were generated using qiime 1 9 1 with the uclust method at 97 similarity to obtain taxonomic summaries caporaso et al 2010 2 7 modeling biomass and predator growth on the heterotrophic biofilm in order to qualitatively explain the mechanisms of predation on void formation mabs and cabs were simulated with a one dimensional biofilm model implemented in aquasim 2 1 reichert 1994 based in our experimental observations where the void formed near continuous layer parallel to the substratum we felt that a one dimensional model would be able to capture predation and void formation adequately a discussion of the model assumptions and limitations is included in the modeling results section stoichiometric coefficients table 2 and process rates table 3 for heterotrophic bacteria were adapted from matsumoto et al 2007 and for predation from moussa et al 2005 the predation process is a function of bacterial concentration and reduction of active predators was simplified in one decay process moussa et al 2005 revilla et al 2016 the short hydraulic retention time approximately 3 h precluded appreciable accumulation of suspended growth cod scod and do so2 were modeled as soluble variables whereas heterotrophic bacteria xh inerts xi predators xp slowly degradable substrate xs and voids xv were modeled as particulate variables xv is a fictitious particulate compound acting as a placeholder for empty space in the biofilm voids in order to occupy the same volume as the lost biomass it has the same density as the other particulate components xv increases when the decrease of xh to predation and decay exceeds the increase due to growth xv decreases when there is net growth once xv is fully consumed i e the void is completely filled with xh further increases in xh contribute to an increase in biofilm thickness it was assumed that predator biomass inside the void does not affect xv note that xv has no reaction rate associated with it and it has the diffusivity of water so it behaves like a void despite having a fictitious density model parameters are shown in table 4 note that detachment was assumed to be erosive affecting the outer biofilm only erosive detachment is simulated in aquasim by a biofilm detachment velocity at its outer edge by setting the detachment velocity equal to the biofilm growth velocity once a desired biofilm thickness has been reached further increases in thickness are prevented since voids in our experiments developed without any appreciable sloughing we felt erosive detachment was justified further study into the effect of detachment on void formation may be warranted if different timescales or shear conditions are considered the model assumed substrate diffusion coefficients vary inside the biofilm as a function of the void fraction which is the same concept as porosity for θ θ f d f 1 f d w no predation if θ 1 then d f d w void and for θ f θ 1 d f 1 f d w θ θ f d w 1 f 1 θ f where d f is the effective diffusivity inside the biofilm d w the diffusivity in water f is the relative biofilm water diffusivity θ f is the initial biofilm void fraction and θ is the void fraction void particulates total particulates the predation rate is a function of bacterial concentration and the oxygen concentration following moussa et al 2005 and revilla et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 predation experiments 3 1 1 low cod mab without predators control this experiment provided a baseline of mab growth and void fraction without predation this test was carried out on a mab with low cod 58 mg l and the inoculum was sequentially passed through three 1 2 μm filters to remove predators the biofilm developed quickly to a thickness of around 220 μm but the void fraction remained very low around 7 an image of the final biofilm after 77 h is provided in table 5 3 1 2 low cod mab in the low cod mab the influent cod was 60 mg l and the effluent 38 mg l the average biofilm thickness reached 192 μm and the void fraction reached 45 after 80 h table 5b while the thickness was somewhat lower than the lowcod control the void fraction was much greater the voids seemed to coalesce into a single continuous void or gap at the base of the biofilm when tracking void development in time they originated inside the biofilm once it reached a 50 100 μm thickness fig 3 b it is not clear whether the first small voids were formed due to predation or due to biofilm streamers or dendritic structures attaching to the biofilm surface however at later stages the voids consolidate and expand in an internal area of the biofilm while new biomass grew in upper zones closer to the bulk liquid where cod concentration was higher fig 3d at the end of the experiment about 80 h voids combined into large near continuous gaps close to the membrane surface where cod was limiting fig 3e the do profile for the low cod mab is shown in fig 4 a following fick s second law changes in substrate slopes in biofilms indicate microbial reaction thus straight do profiles indicate lack of microbial activity in that zone based on the profile the metabolically active zone was from around 260 320 μm indicated with shading the inner biofilm was aerobic but inactive due to cod limitation while the outer biofilm had excess cod but was inactive due to do limitation as seen in table 5 the voids in the low cod mab were primarily in the inner inactive aerobic zone given the extent and location of the voids it appears that predation played a role in the formation of the void at the base of the biofilm 3 1 3 high cod mab the high cod mabr had an effluent cod of 267 mg l after approximately 80 h the average thickness was 223 μm slightly higher than the lowcod mab however the void fraction was significantly lower only 3 9 this is more similar to the low cod mab control dendritic formations were observed at the outer edge of the biofilm table 5 based on the do profile for the high cod mab fig 4b the biofilm activity was much deeper closer to the membrane surface than for the low cod mab this is expected given the higher cod penetration into the biofilm based on the do profile the high cod mab had a much smaller aerobic zone which was nearly all active also it had a much larger outer zone that was inactive due to do limitation the lack of voids despite the presence of protozoa in the inoculum verified with oct videos and dna sequencing results may result from the high growth rates in the biofilm interior offsetting predation 3 1 4 low cod cab the low cod cab experiment was run under the same conditions as the low cod mab but the membrane was supplied with n2 and the bulk was maintained at 5 mg l do this is more typical of conventional co diffusional biofilms after 80 h the average biofilm thickness was 247 μm and the void fraction reached 24 voids were more evenly distributed across the biofilm depth in comparison to the low cod mab case table 5b and d the differences in void location and percentage between the cab and mab may be due to the differing growth patterns in the cab high growth rates occur in the aerobic exterior while the interior usually becomes anaerobic when the biofilm is thick enough potentially protecting it from aerobic predators on the other hand the high growth rates at the exterior can offset the effects of predation the more uniform void distribution may be caused by predation in the earlier stages of biofilm growth or possibly by do penetration into the three dimensional mushroom structures allowing do penetration in the deeper regions where cod may be limiting this void fraction can affect biofilm activity as well as its deformation and possible detachment under fluid shear stress 3 2 void fraction development over time fig 5 shows the void fraction and thickness development for the low cod mab control low cod mab high cod mab and low cod cab tests the increase of void fraction for low cod with predators test started at approximately 20 30 h fig 5a which corresponds to a biofilm thickness of 50 100 μm fig 5b when the biofilm reaches this thickness cod diffusion starts to limit bacterial growth thus favoring void formation by high predation and low bacterial growth rate at the bottom of the biofilm high cod and low cod control tests did not show a significant increase in void fraction even after 80 h in the cab void fraction increased to 10 quickly but then stabilized at 100 h it increased to nearly 30 the high cod mab never developed a high void fraction nor did the low cod mab control no predation interestingly the low cod cab had low void fraction below 10 until around 80 h at that point it suddenly increased to around 30 it is possible that the mushroom shape allowed greater do penetration it also is possible that the do profiles and growth patterns delayed predation in the cab 3 3 factors affecting void formation in flow cell experiments biofilm development is a complex and differentiated phenomenon where both nutrient uptake and detachment processes play a key role hall stoodley et al 2004 furthermore fluid shear can strongly affect biofilm morphology causing deformations in their structures and detachment xavier et al 2005 persat et al 2015 wagner et al 2010 oct images did not reveal sloughing of biofilm during flow cell experiments mabs and cabs with or without predation however biofilm detachment and growth patterns with predation could differ significantly comparing to biofilms without predation and further studies are needed to evaluate the consequences of predation on detachment our observations suggest void formation depends mainly on substrate limitation inside the biofilm and on bacterial and predator growth rates hollowing of biofilms has been observed by in pure culture biofilms hunt et al 2004 in their study the release or detachment of internal cells close to the substratum was induced by a localized and persistent nutrient starvation associated with cell lysis eps degradation and cell dispersal this resulted in large pieces of biofilm loosely attached to the substratum and prone to sloughing similar to hunt et al 2004 we observed the formation of voids at the biofilm base close to the membrane when the cod was limiting at the base of the mab it is possible that void formation in our experiments was similarly initiated by starvation eps degradation and cell dispersal due to starvation however minimal voids formed during the control tests without protozoa suggesting that predation plays a critical role in void formation research by others with oct has revealed internal voids in some non mab biofilms for example protozoan predation also caused cavities in biofilm in gravity driven membranes filtration systems subject to protozoan predation derlon et al 2012 similarly to the mabs the voids were predominantly at the base of the biofilm near the filtration membrane surface the advective flow of do containing water through the biofilm or possibly the transfer of do from the membrane could have stimulated predation at the base of the filter biofilm 3 4 visual evidence of predators in biofilm oct was used to explore the presence of predators in the biofilm during flow cell experiments as biofilm and protozoa have a similar optical density it was not possible to visualize predators inside the biofilm with oct however real time oct imaging revealed the presence of numerous oval shaped organisms with a greater dimension of 20 70 μm moving inside in the voids see fig 6 a and f as well as real time video in supplementary information microscopic observations of fresh mab samples showed free living protozoa fig 6g nikon eclipse 90i epifluorescence microscope 10 objective fig 6h shows a protozoan captured by sem magellan 400 fei company organisms located inside large voids were distinguished from the biofilm as they were continuously moving recirculation flow was stopped during imaging to improve image quality and avoid biofilm matrix movement by liquid flow protozoa were not detected on the biofilm exterior supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2018 10 084 the following is the supplementary data related to this article video 3 5 biological community composition samples were collected from the inoculum and from two mabs experiments high and low cod and sequenced for bacteria and eukarya domains the relative abundance of the proteobacteria phylum was highest for all samples representing 58 in the inoculum 65 in the high cod mab and 54 in low cod mab among bacterial species in the biofilms the highest relative abundance was for members of the dechloromonas and zoogloea genera of the betaproteobacteria and the flavobacterium genus of the bacteroidetes which are common in systems with organic donors and aerobic conditions based on eukaryotic sequences the inoculum mixed liquor activated sludge was dominated by the ciliates tetrahymena and paramecium spp with nearly 20 and 10 relative abundance respectively fig 7 tetrahymena is a filter feeding protozoan that preys effectively only on suspended bacteria arndt et al 2003 amoeba and flagellates only accounted for 3 of the total eukaryotic abundance of the inoculum these results are consistent with protozoan communities found in aeration tanks with stable conditions where biomass grows mainly in suspension madoni 2011 unlike the inoculum the biofilms were dominated by the amoeba naegleria spp with 64 in high cod mab and 42 in low cod mab fig 3 4 the high cod mab also had substantial abundance of other amoeba vermamoeba spp 5 and acanthamoeba spp 8 amoebae feed only on attached biomass weitere et al 2005 they can penetrate biofilms down to the attachment surface creating significant disruptions in the biofilm structure jackson and jones 1991 most likely they are attracted to the aerobic base of the mab fenchel 2014 no ciliates were identified in mab samples ciliate protozoa have been found in flow cell experiments under co diffusional configuration however as ciliates mainly feed on suspended or recently attached biomass they should not significantly affect internal voids böhme et al 2009 interestingly the low cod mab had a high abundance of the flagellate discicristata 20 as with amoeba this group of flagellates are known to feed preferentially on attached biomass parry 2004 presence of the flagellated protozoa spumella spp resulted in a porosity increase of almost four times greater than biofilms without predation böhme et al 2009 in this study though porosity includes spaces connected to the bulk liquid also the pores were distributed within the biofilm matrix in contrast to our results where voids were mostly located at the biofilm base in our research oct revealed abundant protozoa in the internal voids in the low cod mab fig 6 the outer biofilm would not be amenable to surface feeders given the high flow rate and anaerobic conditions however the inner voids were ideal environments for gliders and attached protozoa given the high do concentration lack of fluid flow and availability of exposed biofilm surfaces the sequencing results together with our experimental results suggest the following ecological succession in the low cod mabs 1 during the initial stages of biofilm formation the thin biofilm is almost fully penetrated with cod and do allowing rapid microbial growth in the biofilm given the lack of voids amoeba dominate the biofilm clustering near the aerobic base and avoiding the outermost anaerobic zone free swimming ciliates feeding preferentially on suspended bacteria are washed out of the system along with planktonic biomass 2 as the biofilm thickness increases the base become cod limited decreasing the microbial growth rate in that location amoeba predation in the nutrient starved base creates small voids providing a habitat for browsing flagellates 3 rapid growing and mobile flagellates consume the biofilm more quickly this leads to the formation of a large continuous void in the aerobic zone the void expands up to the active zone of the biofilm which has high growth rates exceeding predation rates 4 flagellates and amoeba continue to graze on the active zone possibly reaching a steady state between growth and predation as mentioned absence of ciliates in mabs can be due to wash out however ciliates and flagellates could also be affected by predation parry 2004 for a cab voids may form if the do penetrates deeper than the cod in this case an aerobic zone with low growth rates is formed allowing for predation without replacement this growth zone and underlying voids would expand upwards as the biofilm grows it is not clear if this is what occurred in the low cod cabs previous studies with co diffusional flow cells similar to our cab suggested that porosity increased within the biofilm in presence of flagellates however it remained statistically similar when free swimming biomass grazing protozoa feed on the surface of the biofilm böhme et al 2009 rychert and neu 2011 this is discussed in the next section 3 6 modeling a one dimensional mathematical biofilm model including predation and void development was developed and used to qualitatively and mechanistically explain the experimental results the actual biofilm was quite rough in some cases see table 5 but a one dimensional model was considered adequate to describe the void formation in a non quantitative fashion the model detachment coefficient erosive detachment was adjusted to obtain the observed average biofilm thickness from the respective test all other parameters used were extracted from literature and this study table 4 note that detachment can have an important effect on biofilm areal porosity xavier et al 2005 wagner et al 2010 however areal porosity commonly includes the pores that are connected to the bulk liquid for example dendritic biofilm structures contribute to areal porosity but not to internal voids beyenal et al 2004 wagner and horn 2017 also there was no observable detachment or re attachment during the period in which the voids were formed see fig 3 further research is needed to incorporate the effect of detachment on biofilm voids and the effects of voids on detachment in a biofilm model the model was able to accurately capture do profiles experimentally measured for the low and high cod mabs fig 5 for the low cod mab the cod is depleted in the middle of the biofilm do penetrates further into the biofilm moving the zone of high activity towards the middle fig 8 a and d the maximum growth rate is lower than the high cod mab case where both substrates are at relatively high concentrations maximum predation activity occurs in the central part of the biofilm but also exists close to the membrane where the conditions are highly aerobic the high predation activity and low bacterial growth results in the formation of voids as seen in fig 8g the maximum voids fraction is around 17 this fraction is distinct from the biofilm porosity that in the aquasim biofilm model which considered the concentration of cells within the biofilm matrix this porosity was taken as 75 in our model for the high cod mab there is less do penetration into the biofilm so the maximum microbial growth rates as well as the maximum predation activity is closer to the membrane fig 8b and e as both growth rates are high void formation is offset by new biomass fig 8h finally for the low cod cab fig 8c f and i the highest growth rate of both is located at the biofilm water interface where both donor and acceptor concentrations are highest as with the high cod mab predation in this zone can be offset by growth preventing the formation of voids voids seem more evenly distributed throughout the biofilm thickness as observed experimentally this may be due to the slightly greater penetration of do compared to cod this may allow for small aerobic zone with low growth rates that progresses outwards and the biofilm thickness increases the modeled phenomena consisting of substrate transport and utilization biofilm growth and erosive detachment was able to predict void formation inside the biofilm the model supports the general hypothesis that voids form when biofilms affected by predation have aerobic zones with low growth rates in these zones the predation is not offset by new biomass formation although not shown here the model predicts the same would occur if the conventional biofilm has high bulk do and low bulk cod concentrations such that an aerobic low growth zone forms in the interior note that the model was only qualitative and not intended to show all possible effects of predation on mabr biofilms it may not be applicable to conditions different from those in our experiments as sloughing was not observed during the course of our experiments the model only included erosive detachment thus only bacteria at the biofilm surface were subject to detachment at longer timescales predation could cause sloughing also our model only included a single protozoan species and single microbial species future research should determine if amoeba and flagellates have substantially different growth rates or modes of growth and should be modeled separately the model assumes predators are fixed within the biofilm e g non motile this may not be accurate for flagellates or ciliates which can move in voids and amoeba which may be able to migrate towards aerobic zones thus in the model when there are high bacteria growth rates near the base of the membrane the predators are pushed out of the biofilm fig 8h and i predators only develop to higher concentrations when the bacterial growth rates are low near the membrane fig 8g the impacts of predation on biofilm morphology void spreading and the effects of fluid flow on biofilm deformation and detachment would be better captured with a multidimensional biofilm model although this would require a significant computational effort such an effort is beyond the scope of this research the model only considered readily biodegradable cod also the predator kinetics should be further explored in our model predators had a low maximum specific growth rate μmax of 0 24 d 1 moussa et al 2005 however a more recent model of an mbbr process by revilla et al 2016 has a μmax of 2 2 d 1 specific bacterial groups such as nitrifiers or anammox can be targeted by predators greatly decreasing removal rates in biofilm systems lee and welander 1994 suarez et al 2015 future modeling could consider multispecies biofilms and also the ability of certain microbial species e g filaments aob clusters to protect themselves against predation furthermore particle based biofilm models could be evaluated to account for massive sloughing events martin et al 2015 when fluid shear plays a relevant role in biofilm morphology development the large voids in the low cod mabs can impact mabr processes the larger voids close to the membrane would probably have a higher diffusivity than biofilm increasing the o2 mass transfer towards the outer biofilm the nearly continuous void along the membrane could affect the biofilm adhesion allowing biofilm sloughing previous studies have also suggested that hollow cell clusters with reduced viscosities weaken biofilm attachment to the substratum favoring massive detachment hunt et al 2004 although not studied systematically we observed biofilm detachment when increasing the recirculation flow rates at the end of our experiments it appeared that the biofilm completely lost its adhesion to the surface of the membrane being able to slide around it freely this may also explain massive biofilm sloughing in a mabr study with flat sheet membranes semmens et al 2005 4 conclusions our research suggests when biofilm predation occurs in aerobic zones with little or no growth large voids form when predation occurs in zones of active biofilm growth no voids form as biofilm loss is offset by biofilm formation in mabs the biofilm base tends to be inactive and aerobic favoring predation and void formation predation in biofilms appears to be initiated by amoeba once amoeba create voids they are colonized by flagellates further enlarging them the extended voids separate the biofilm from the membrane this may result in biofilm sloughing especially in flat sheet mabs future work should assess the effects of predation over specific bacterial groups such as heterotrophs nitrifiers and anammox bacteria

19149,the membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr is a novel wastewater treatment technology based on oxygen supplying membranes the counter diffusion of oxygen and electron donors in mabrs leads to unique behavior and we hypothesized it also could impact predation we used optical coherence tomography oct microsensor analyses and mathematical modeling to investigate predation in membrane aerated biofilms mabs when protozoa were excluded from the inoculum the mab s oct observable void fraction was around 5 when protozoa were included the void fraction grew to nearly 50 with large continuous voids at the base of the biofilm real time oct imaging showed highly motile protozoa in the voids mabs with protozoa and a high bulk cod 270 mg l only had 4 void fraction dna sequencing revealed a high relative abundance of amoeba in both high and low cod mabs flagellates were only abundant in the low cod mab modeling also suggested a relationship between substrate concentrations diffusion mode co or counter diffusion and biofilm void fraction results suggest that amoeba proliferate in the biofilm interior especially in the aerobic zones voids form once cod limitation at the base of mabs allows predation rates to exceed microbial growth rates once formed the voids provide a niche for motile protozoa which expand the voids into a large continuous gap this increases the potential for biofilm sloughing and may have detrimental effects on slow growing aerobic microorganisms such as nitrifying bacteria graphical abstract image 1 keywords mabr biofilm protozoa predation voids porosity 1 introduction membrane aerated biofilm reactors mabrs are a novel wastewater treatment technology based on air or oxygen supplying membranes the membranes deliver oxygen directly to biofilms growing on the membrane outer surface achieving up to 100 percent oxygen transfer efficiency ahmed et al 2004 martin and nerenberg 2012 pankhania et al 1994 perez calleja et al 2017 semmens et al 2005 interest in mabrs has increased significantly in recent years this is partly due to the launch of several commercial mabr applications peeters et al 2017 in order to develop effective mabr applications a fundamental understanding of the behavior of mabr biofilms mabs is needed mabs behave differently from conventional or conventionally aerated biofilms cabs due to the counter diffusion of the electron donor and acceptor nerenberg 2016 for example cabs have the highest dissolved oxygen do and cod concentrations at the biofilm exterior fig 1 a thus their highest metabolic activity always is at the biofilm exterior in mabs in contrast the do penetrates from the base of the biofilm so the highest activity can occur anywhere in the biofilm fig 1b nerenberg 2016 this can lead to differences in biofilm microbial community morphology and activity downing and nerenberg 2008 2007 matsumoto et al 2007 pellicer nàcher and smets 2014 our research was motivated by the observation of large voids at the base of heterotrophic mabs totally disconnected from the bulk liquid these voids were absent from cabs grown under similar conditions the voids appeared after a few days and quickly expanded to form near continuous gaps along the base of the mabs no previous research reported similar phenomena in this paper we refer to biofilm voids as empty biofilm spaces that lack connection to the bulk liquid we avoided the term porosity as its use commonly includes spaces connected to the bulk liquid we hypothesized that void formation in mabs resulted from protozoan predation as our real time imaging showed putative protozoa actively moving within these internal voids if true this could have important implications for the stability of mabs a better understanding of this phenomena could allow the development of strategies to encourage or discourage this phenomenon as needed predation by higher organisms is known to impact the structure and function of environmental biofilms although few studies have quantified predation within biofilms it has not been considered explicitly in past biofilm models common protozoa in wastewater systems include amoebae flagellates and ciliates jürgens and matz 2002 lee and welander 1996 madoni 2011 amoeba typically are predominant in biofilms arndt et al 2003 they establish themselves on or within biofilms and may significantly influence biofilm growth patterns and structure jackson and jones 1991 scherwass et al 2016 flagellates can glide over the biofilm exterior and feed on suspended or attached biomass arndt et al 2003 ciliates are able to walk over the substratum with their cilia they browse on loosely attached bacteria or suspended bacteria arndt et al 2003 protozoa can impact biofilms in a variety of ways for example protozoan metabolism can re mineralize nutrients and stimulate biofilm growth scherwass et al 2016 they also can disturb the initial stages of biofilm development rychert and neu 2011 protozoa can indirectly enhance solute transport in biofilms by their movement increasing porosity and causing morphological changes in the biofilm matrix böhme et al 2009 ciliates can modify biofilm internal structure by creating holes and channels driving the biomass morphology to grazing resistant microcolonies böhme et al 2009 dopheide et al 2011 or biofilm structures weitere et al 2005 amoeba can disrupt biofilms by moving through its matrix and grazing on biomass potentially causing biofilm sloughing jackson and jones 1991 and forming cavities derlon et al 2012 given that most protozoa prefer aerobic environments fenchel 2014 finlay 1990 and the aerobic zones differ between cabs and mabs the effects of predation may differ as well metazoa such as worms also have important effects on biofilms consuming biomass and creating rough biofilm morphologies at a macro scale derlon et al 2013 klein et al 2016 also some pure culture biofilms have been observed to hollow out the interior of mushroom structures reportedly due to starvation and degradation of eps hunt et al 2004 growth conditions and detachment can also affect the porosity of biofilms marchal et al 2011 despite these known effects there are no previous reports of large continuous voids forming entirely within the biofilm with no connection to the bulk liquid this research explores void formation in mabs the research strategy was to study mixed culture heterotrophic mabs with low bulk cod such that cod limitation occurred at the base of the biofilm controls included an mab inoculated without protozoa an mab with high bulk cod and a cab with low bulk cod studies included biofilm imaging with optical coherence tomography oct profiling with do microsensors and dna sequence analysis also mathematical modeling was used to qualitatively explain the mechanisms of void formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 biofilm growth experiments heterotrophic biofilms were grown in bench scale flow cells containing a single hollow fiber membrane fig 2 the flow cells were either operated as mabs or cabs for mab operation the bulk liquid was maintained anaerobic by recirculating the flow through a reservoir with n2 sparging the membrane lumen was pressurized with air for cab operation the recirculation reservoir was sparged with air providing a do of 5 0 2 mg l in the bulk liquid and the membrane lumen was pressurized with n2 allowing aerobic conditions in the outer part of the biofilm and anaerobic in the inner part air or n2 was supplied to the membrane at a relative pressure of 34 5 kpa 5 psig this pressure results in do concentration at the membrane surface about 8 10 mg l for the mab the air or n2 gas sparging was at approximately 15 ml min the effluent was pumped out of this reservoir from a fixed elevation in the reservoir maintaining a constant water level the flow cell was a square sectioned glass tube with a 6 mm inner dimension and 40 cm length with a single 460 μm diameter silicone hollow fiber membrane in the center oxymem ltd county westmeath ireland fig 2 the membrane was located at the bottom of the flow cell supported at both ends by an air supplying manifold the membrane was glued to a plastic support with the upper half exposed to the liquid and the bottom half embedded in glue fixing the membrane to the bottom of the flow cell minimized movement caused by the water flow and improved the oct imaging the other end of the membrane was open ended in all experiments the flow cell had seven ports located every 5 cm along the flow cell for microsensor do measurements a recirculation flow rate of 15 2 ml min resulting in a laminar flow of 0 01 m s re 70 provided well mixed conditions and hydraulic shear on the biofilm masterflex l s cole parmer no sloughing or significant detachment was observed in biofilms exposed to this shear stress during experiment duration up to 100 h oxygen in the bulk liquid was measured using a portable dissolved oxygen probe

experimental conditions for the tests performed in this study is shown in table 1 the flow cell was operated at room temperature approximately 22 c it was inoculated with mixed liquor from a local wastewater treatment plant the plant was a conventional activated sludge plant with cod removal and nitrification and a solids retention time of around 10 days for the control test experiment 1 protozoa were removed by three filtration steps with 1 2 μm pore size filters isopore membrane filters millipore wey et al 2012 for the other tests the reactors were inoculated with 10 ml of the supernatant of mixed liquor that had been vigorously mixed and allowed to settle for 30 min the inoculated reactor was allowed to recirculate for 24 h before starting the influent flow which was considered the beginning of the experiment time zero from the time of inoculation the membrane lumen was pressurized with air and the bulk liquid was continuously sparged with n2 to prevent do accumulation see sparging bottle on the magnetic stirrer in fig 2 for the mab low and high cod concentrations were used to evaluate the effect of donor limiting conditions inside the biofilm all experiments were carried out over 80 100 h when the biofilms had reached a stable thickness 2 4 imaging of biofilm internal structure oct was used to image 2d vertical biofilm sections i e sections perpendicular to attachment surface ganymede ii spectral domain oct system thorlabs inc the image collection software was thorimage oct version 4 3 thorlabs inc www thorlabs com the biofilm flow cell was kept under the oct for the duration of each experiment and biofilm development and void formation were observed for a fixed location this location was 15 cm from the liquid and air inlet side of the reactor and covered approximately 6 7 mm of biofilm length the oct resolution was approximately 8 μm so the observed voids were only those larger than 10 μm fortunato et al 2017 wagner et al 2017 in our experiments both biofilm water and biofilm substratum interfaces were clearly detectable this is because the maximum biofilm thickness of around 250 μm allowed full oct penetration down to the membrane surface no shadowing effects were identified images were captured every 3 5 h real time imaging was collected over 10 20 s periods to visualize predator movement within the biofilm videos showing the movement of predators were made using imagej 1 50b wayne rasband national institutes of health usa a typical video is provided in the supplementary material the oct images were digitally processed to estimate biofilm thickness area and void fraction matlab programs matlab r2013a the mathworks inc were adapted from lewandowski and beyenal 2013 image processing included a digital correction of oct image including the deletion of background noise from raw oct captures and isolation of the biofilm structure b conversion of corrected image to a binary black and white format to allow post processing and parameter estimation the thresholding procedure used was the iterative selection method lewandowski and beyenal 2013 c estimation of void fraction area and thickness of the biofilm where void fraction is the number of internal void pixels disconnected from the bulk liquid divided by the total number of pixels void and biofilm biofilm area is the total number of pixels and biofilm average thickness is the biofilm area divided by the image length in the membrane direction all initial calculations were made in terms of pixels final results were transformed to metric units using scale data from oct software 2 5 do measurements oxygen microelectrodes were used to measure the do profiles in the biofilm profiles spanned from the membrane surface across the biofilm and into the bulk clark type oxygen microelectrodes unisense denmark with a 25 μm tip diameter were used to measure do concentrations at 20 μm intervals perpendicular to the membrane the microelectrode movement was controlled with a micro manipulator model mm33 2 unisense a s the do profiles typically reached a distance of around 600 1000 μm from the membrane surface into the bulk liquid each plotted do profile corresponds to the average of four replicates profiles made at different biofilm locations at a measuring port located 15 cm from the entrance of the flow cell do measurements were used to verify the location of aerobic and anaerobic areas within the biofilm and were matched with simulated oxygen profiles 2 6 dna extraction sequencing and data analysis total community dna was extracted from biofilm samples and the inoculum using the powersoil dna kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca a nanodrop spectrophotometer nanodrop 2000 thermo scientific was used to quantify the concentration and check the quality of the extracted dna primer sets 515f 926r walters et al 2016 and euk1391f euk br amaral zettler et al 2009 were used to amplify bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna gene v4 v5 variable region and eukaryotic 18s rrna v9 region respectively the pcr amplicons were purified using the ultraclean pcr clean up kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca to remove primer dimers and other non specific dna dna sequencing using illumina miseq with paired end reads was sequenced at the center for research informatics cri chicago il raw sequencing data were submitted to the ncbi sra database under the accession number srp 139044 sequences less than 250 bases were discarded subsequently chimeric sequences were checked and filtered using the usearch algorithm with the greengenes 13 8 reference sequence database mcdonald et al 2012 sequencing data was then processed and de novo operational taxonomic unit otu clusters were generated using qiime 1 9 1 with the uclust method at 97 similarity to obtain taxonomic summaries caporaso et al 2010 2 7 modeling biomass and predator growth on the heterotrophic biofilm in order to qualitatively explain the mechanisms of predation on void formation mabs and cabs were simulated with a one dimensional biofilm model implemented in aquasim 2 1 reichert 1994 based in our experimental observations where the void formed near continuous layer parallel to the substratum we felt that a one dimensional model would be able to capture predation and void formation adequately a discussion of the model assumptions and limitations is included in the modeling results section stoichiometric coefficients table 2 and process rates table 3 for heterotrophic bacteria were adapted from matsumoto et al 2007 and for predation from moussa et al 2005 the predation process is a function of bacterial concentration and reduction of active predators was simplified in one decay process moussa et al 2005 revilla et al 2016 the short hydraulic retention time approximately 3 h precluded appreciable accumulation of suspended growth cod scod and do so2 were modeled as soluble variables whereas heterotrophic bacteria xh inerts xi predators xp slowly degradable substrate xs and voids xv were modeled as particulate variables xv is a fictitious particulate compound acting as a placeholder for empty space in the biofilm voids in order to occupy the same volume as the lost biomass it has the same density as the other particulate components xv increases when the decrease of xh to predation and decay exceeds the increase due to growth xv decreases when there is net growth once xv is fully consumed i e the void is completely filled with xh further increases in xh contribute to an increase in biofilm thickness it was assumed that predator biomass inside the void does not affect xv note that xv has no reaction rate associated with it and it has the diffusivity of water so it behaves like a void despite having a fictitious density model parameters are shown in table 4 note that detachment was assumed to be erosive affecting the outer biofilm only erosive detachment is simulated in aquasim by a biofilm detachment velocity at its outer edge by setting the detachment velocity equal to the biofilm growth velocity once a desired biofilm thickness has been reached further increases in thickness are prevented since voids in our experiments developed without any appreciable sloughing we felt erosive detachment was justified further study into the effect of detachment on void formation may be warranted if different timescales or shear conditions are considered the model assumed substrate diffusion coefficients vary inside the biofilm as a function of the void fraction which is the same concept as porosity for θ θ f d f 1 f d w no predation if θ 1 then d f d w void and for θ f θ 1 d f 1 f d w θ θ f d w 1 f 1 θ f where d f is the effective diffusivity inside the biofilm d w the diffusivity in water f is the relative biofilm water diffusivity θ f is the initial biofilm void fraction and θ is the void fraction void particulates total particulates the predation rate is a function of bacterial concentration and the oxygen concentration following moussa et al 2005 and revilla et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 predation experiments 3 1 1 low cod mab without predators control this experiment provided a baseline of mab growth and void fraction without predation this test was carried out on a mab with low cod 58 mg l and the inoculum was sequentially passed through three 1 2 μm filters to remove predators the biofilm developed quickly to a thickness of around 220 μm but the void fraction remained very low around 7 an image of the final biofilm after 77 h is provided in table 5 3 1 2 low cod mab in the low cod mab the influent cod was 60 mg l and the effluent 38 mg l the average biofilm thickness reached 192 μm and the void fraction reached 45 after 80 h table 5b while the thickness was somewhat lower than the lowcod control the void fraction was much greater the voids seemed to coalesce into a single continuous void or gap at the base of the biofilm when tracking void development in time they originated inside the biofilm once it reached a 50 100 μm thickness fig 3 b it is not clear whether the first small voids were formed due to predation or due to biofilm streamers or dendritic structures attaching to the biofilm surface however at later stages the voids consolidate and expand in an internal area of the biofilm while new biomass grew in upper zones closer to the bulk liquid where cod concentration was higher fig 3d at the end of the experiment about 80 h voids combined into large near continuous gaps close to the membrane surface where cod was limiting fig 3e the do profile for the low cod mab is shown in fig 4 a following fick s second law changes in substrate slopes in biofilms indicate microbial reaction thus straight do profiles indicate lack of microbial activity in that zone based on the profile the metabolically active zone was from around 260 320 μm indicated with shading the inner biofilm was aerobic but inactive due to cod limitation while the outer biofilm had excess cod but was inactive due to do limitation as seen in table 5 the voids in the low cod mab were primarily in the inner inactive aerobic zone given the extent and location of the voids it appears that predation played a role in the formation of the void at the base of the biofilm 3 1 3 high cod mab the high cod mabr had an effluent cod of 267 mg l after approximately 80 h the average thickness was 223 μm slightly higher than the lowcod mab however the void fraction was significantly lower only 3 9 this is more similar to the low cod mab control dendritic formations were observed at the outer edge of the biofilm table 5 based on the do profile for the high cod mab fig 4b the biofilm activity was much deeper closer to the membrane surface than for the low cod mab this is expected given the higher cod penetration into the biofilm based on the do profile the high cod mab had a much smaller aerobic zone which was nearly all active also it had a much larger outer zone that was inactive due to do limitation the lack of voids despite the presence of protozoa in the inoculum verified with oct videos and dna sequencing results may result from the high growth rates in the biofilm interior offsetting predation 3 1 4 low cod cab the low cod cab experiment was run under the same conditions as the low cod mab but the membrane was supplied with n2 and the bulk was maintained at 5 mg l do this is more typical of conventional co diffusional biofilms after 80 h the average biofilm thickness was 247 μm and the void fraction reached 24 voids were more evenly distributed across the biofilm depth in comparison to the low cod mab case table 5b and d the differences in void location and percentage between the cab and mab may be due to the differing growth patterns in the cab high growth rates occur in the aerobic exterior while the interior usually becomes anaerobic when the biofilm is thick enough potentially protecting it from aerobic predators on the other hand the high growth rates at the exterior can offset the effects of predation the more uniform void distribution may be caused by predation in the earlier stages of biofilm growth or possibly by do penetration into the three dimensional mushroom structures allowing do penetration in the deeper regions where cod may be limiting this void fraction can affect biofilm activity as well as its deformation and possible detachment under fluid shear stress 3 2 void fraction development over time fig 5 shows the void fraction and thickness development for the low cod mab control low cod mab high cod mab and low cod cab tests the increase of void fraction for low cod with predators test started at approximately 20 30 h fig 5a which corresponds to a biofilm thickness of 50 100 μm fig 5b when the biofilm reaches this thickness cod diffusion starts to limit bacterial growth thus favoring void formation by high predation and low bacterial growth rate at the bottom of the biofilm high cod and low cod control tests did not show a significant increase in void fraction even after 80 h in the cab void fraction increased to 10 quickly but then stabilized at 100 h it increased to nearly 30 the high cod mab never developed a high void fraction nor did the low cod mab control no predation interestingly the low cod cab had low void fraction below 10 until around 80 h at that point it suddenly increased to around 30 it is possible that the mushroom shape allowed greater do penetration it also is possible that the do profiles and growth patterns delayed predation in the cab 3 3 factors affecting void formation in flow cell experiments biofilm development is a complex and differentiated phenomenon where both nutrient uptake and detachment processes play a key role hall stoodley et al 2004 furthermore fluid shear can strongly affect biofilm morphology causing deformations in their structures and detachment xavier et al 2005 persat et al 2015 wagner et al 2010 oct images did not reveal sloughing of biofilm during flow cell experiments mabs and cabs with or without predation however biofilm detachment and growth patterns with predation could differ significantly comparing to biofilms without predation and further studies are needed to evaluate the consequences of predation on detachment our observations suggest void formation depends mainly on substrate limitation inside the biofilm and on bacterial and predator growth rates hollowing of biofilms has been observed by in pure culture biofilms hunt et al 2004 in their study the release or detachment of internal cells close to the substratum was induced by a localized and persistent nutrient starvation associated with cell lysis eps degradation and cell dispersal this resulted in large pieces of biofilm loosely attached to the substratum and prone to sloughing similar to hunt et al 2004 we observed the formation of voids at the biofilm base close to the membrane when the cod was limiting at the base of the mab it is possible that void formation in our experiments was similarly initiated by starvation eps degradation and cell dispersal due to starvation however minimal voids formed during the control tests without protozoa suggesting that predation plays a critical role in void formation research by others with oct has revealed internal voids in some non mab biofilms for example protozoan predation also caused cavities in biofilm in gravity driven membranes filtration systems subject to protozoan predation derlon et al 2012 similarly to the mabs the voids were predominantly at the base of the biofilm near the filtration membrane surface the advective flow of do containing water through the biofilm or possibly the transfer of do from the membrane could have stimulated predation at the base of the filter biofilm 3 4 visual evidence of predators in biofilm oct was used to explore the presence of predators in the biofilm during flow cell experiments as biofilm and protozoa have a similar optical density it was not possible to visualize predators inside the biofilm with oct however real time oct imaging revealed the presence of numerous oval shaped organisms with a greater dimension of 20 70 μm moving inside in the voids see fig 6 a and f as well as real time video in supplementary information microscopic observations of fresh mab samples showed free living protozoa fig 6g nikon eclipse 90i epifluorescence microscope 10 objective fig 6h shows a protozoan captured by sem magellan 400 fei company organisms located inside large voids were distinguished from the biofilm as they were continuously moving recirculation flow was stopped during imaging to improve image quality and avoid biofilm matrix movement by liquid flow protozoa were not detected on the biofilm exterior supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2018 10 084 the following is the supplementary data related to this article video 3 5 biological community composition samples were collected from the inoculum and from two mabs experiments high and low cod and sequenced for bacteria and eukarya domains the relative abundance of the proteobacteria phylum was highest for all samples representing 58 in the inoculum 65 in the high cod mab and 54 in low cod mab among bacterial species in the biofilms the highest relative abundance was for members of the dechloromonas and zoogloea genera of the betaproteobacteria and the flavobacterium genus of the bacteroidetes which are common in systems with organic donors and aerobic conditions based on eukaryotic sequences the inoculum mixed liquor activated sludge was dominated by the ciliates tetrahymena and paramecium spp with nearly 20 and 10 relative abundance respectively fig 7 tetrahymena is a filter feeding protozoan that preys effectively only on suspended bacteria arndt et al 2003 amoeba and flagellates only accounted for 3 of the total eukaryotic abundance of the inoculum these results are consistent with protozoan communities found in aeration tanks with stable conditions where biomass grows mainly in suspension madoni 2011 unlike the inoculum the biofilms were dominated by the amoeba naegleria spp with 64 in high cod mab and 42 in low cod mab fig 3 4 the high cod mab also had substantial abundance of other amoeba vermamoeba spp 5 and acanthamoeba spp 8 amoebae feed only on attached biomass weitere et al 2005 they can penetrate biofilms down to the attachment surface creating significant disruptions in the biofilm structure jackson and jones 1991 most likely they are attracted to the aerobic base of the mab fenchel 2014 no ciliates were identified in mab samples ciliate protozoa have been found in flow cell experiments under co diffusional configuration however as ciliates mainly feed on suspended or recently attached biomass they should not significantly affect internal voids böhme et al 2009 interestingly the low cod mab had a high abundance of the flagellate discicristata 20 as with amoeba this group of flagellates are known to feed preferentially on attached biomass parry 2004 presence of the flagellated protozoa spumella spp resulted in a porosity increase of almost four times greater than biofilms without predation böhme et al 2009 in this study though porosity includes spaces connected to the bulk liquid also the pores were distributed within the biofilm matrix in contrast to our results where voids were mostly located at the biofilm base in our research oct revealed abundant protozoa in the internal voids in the low cod mab fig 6 the outer biofilm would not be amenable to surface feeders given the high flow rate and anaerobic conditions however the inner voids were ideal environments for gliders and attached protozoa given the high do concentration lack of fluid flow and availability of exposed biofilm surfaces the sequencing results together with our experimental results suggest the following ecological succession in the low cod mabs 1 during the initial stages of biofilm formation the thin biofilm is almost fully penetrated with cod and do allowing rapid microbial growth in the biofilm given the lack of voids amoeba dominate the biofilm clustering near the aerobic base and avoiding the outermost anaerobic zone free swimming ciliates feeding preferentially on suspended bacteria are washed out of the system along with planktonic biomass 2 as the biofilm thickness increases the base become cod limited decreasing the microbial growth rate in that location amoeba predation in the nutrient starved base creates small voids providing a habitat for browsing flagellates 3 rapid growing and mobile flagellates consume the biofilm more quickly this leads to the formation of a large continuous void in the aerobic zone the void expands up to the active zone of the biofilm which has high growth rates exceeding predation rates 4 flagellates and amoeba continue to graze on the active zone possibly reaching a steady state between growth and predation as mentioned absence of ciliates in mabs can be due to wash out however ciliates and flagellates could also be affected by predation parry 2004 for a cab voids may form if the do penetrates deeper than the cod in this case an aerobic zone with low growth rates is formed allowing for predation without replacement this growth zone and underlying voids would expand upwards as the biofilm grows it is not clear if this is what occurred in the low cod cabs previous studies with co diffusional flow cells similar to our cab suggested that porosity increased within the biofilm in presence of flagellates however it remained statistically similar when free swimming biomass grazing protozoa feed on the surface of the biofilm böhme et al 2009 rychert and neu 2011 this is discussed in the next section 3 6 modeling a one dimensional mathematical biofilm model including predation and void development was developed and used to qualitatively and mechanistically explain the experimental results the actual biofilm was quite rough in some cases see table 5 but a one dimensional model was considered adequate to describe the void formation in a non quantitative fashion the model detachment coefficient erosive detachment was adjusted to obtain the observed average biofilm thickness from the respective test all other parameters used were extracted from literature and this study table 4 note that detachment can have an important effect on biofilm areal porosity xavier et al 2005 wagner et al 2010 however areal porosity commonly includes the pores that are connected to the bulk liquid for example dendritic biofilm structures contribute to areal porosity but not to internal voids beyenal et al 2004 wagner and horn 2017 also there was no observable detachment or re attachment during the period in which the voids were formed see fig 3 further research is needed to incorporate the effect of detachment on biofilm voids and the effects of voids on detachment in a biofilm model the model was able to accurately capture do profiles experimentally measured for the low and high cod mabs fig 5 for the low cod mab the cod is depleted in the middle of the biofilm do penetrates further into the biofilm moving the zone of high activity towards the middle fig 8 a and d the maximum growth rate is lower than the high cod mab case where both substrates are at relatively high concentrations maximum predation activity occurs in the central part of the biofilm but also exists close to the membrane where the conditions are highly aerobic the high predation activity and low bacterial growth results in the formation of voids as seen in fig 8g the maximum voids fraction is around 17 this fraction is distinct from the biofilm porosity that in the aquasim biofilm model which considered the concentration of cells within the biofilm matrix this porosity was taken as 75 in our model for the high cod mab there is less do penetration into the biofilm so the maximum microbial growth rates as well as the maximum predation activity is closer to the membrane fig 8b and e as both growth rates are high void formation is offset by new biomass fig 8h finally for the low cod cab fig 8c f and i the highest growth rate of both is located at the biofilm water interface where both donor and acceptor concentrations are highest as with the high cod mab predation in this zone can be offset by growth preventing the formation of voids voids seem more evenly distributed throughout the biofilm thickness as observed experimentally this may be due to the slightly greater penetration of do compared to cod this may allow for small aerobic zone with low growth rates that progresses outwards and the biofilm thickness increases the modeled phenomena consisting of substrate transport and utilization biofilm growth and erosive detachment was able to predict void formation inside the biofilm the model supports the general hypothesis that voids form when biofilms affected by predation have aerobic zones with low growth rates in these zones the predation is not offset by new biomass formation although not shown here the model predicts the same would occur if the conventional biofilm has high bulk do and low bulk cod concentrations such that an aerobic low growth zone forms in the interior note that the model was only qualitative and not intended to show all possible effects of predation on mabr biofilms it may not be applicable to conditions different from those in our experiments as sloughing was not observed during the course of our experiments the model only included erosive detachment thus only bacteria at the biofilm surface were subject to detachment at longer timescales predation could cause sloughing also our model only included a single protozoan species and single microbial species future research should determine if amoeba and flagellates have substantially different growth rates or modes of growth and should be modeled separately the model assumes predators are fixed within the biofilm e g non motile this may not be accurate for flagellates or ciliates which can move in voids and amoeba which may be able to migrate towards aerobic zones thus in the model when there are high bacteria growth rates near the base of the membrane the predators are pushed out of the biofilm fig 8h and i predators only develop to higher concentrations when the bacterial growth rates are low near the membrane fig 8g the impacts of predation on biofilm morphology void spreading and the effects of fluid flow on biofilm deformation and detachment would be better captured with a multidimensional biofilm model although this would require a significant computational effort such an effort is beyond the scope of this research the model only considered readily biodegradable cod also the predator kinetics should be further explored in our model predators had a low maximum specific growth rate μmax of 0 24 d 1 moussa et al 2005 however a more recent model of an mbbr process by revilla et al 2016 has a μmax of 2 2 d 1 specific bacterial groups such as nitrifiers or anammox can be targeted by predators greatly decreasing removal rates in biofilm systems lee and welander 1994 suarez et al 2015 future modeling could consider multispecies biofilms and also the ability of certain microbial species e g filaments aob clusters to protect themselves against predation furthermore particle based biofilm models could be evaluated to account for massive sloughing events martin et al 2015 when fluid shear plays a relevant role in biofilm morphology development the large voids in the low cod mabs can impact mabr processes the larger voids close to the membrane would probably have a higher diffusivity than biofilm increasing the o2 mass transfer towards the outer biofilm the nearly continuous void along the membrane could affect the biofilm adhesion allowing biofilm sloughing previous studies have also suggested that hollow cell clusters with reduced viscosities weaken biofilm attachment to the substratum favoring massive detachment hunt et al 2004 although not studied systematically we observed biofilm detachment when increasing the recirculation flow rates at the end of our experiments it appeared that the biofilm completely lost its adhesion to the surface of the membrane being able to slide around it freely this may also explain massive biofilm sloughing in a mabr study with flat sheet membranes semmens et al 2005 4 conclusions our research suggests when biofilm predation occurs in aerobic zones with little or no growth large voids form when predation occurs in zones of active biofilm growth no voids form as biofilm loss is offset by biofilm formation in mabs the biofilm base tends to be inactive and aerobic favoring predation and void formation predation in biofilms appears to be initiated by amoeba once amoeba create voids they are colonized by flagellates further enlarging them the extended voids separate the biofilm from the membrane this may result in biofilm sloughing especially in flat sheet mabs future work should assess the effects of predation over specific bacterial groups such as heterotrophs nitrifiers and anammox bacteria future studies could evaluate how structures change over longer time periods due to debris accumulation biofilm structure consolidation and microbial community changes declaration of interests the
