5105,studying groundwater inflow and quantifying its flux into aquatic systems remain challenging because of geological and topographical heterogeneities in this study we measured the 222rn activities in the surface water and porewater of a shallow wetland the baekseok reservoir wetland to investigate the groundwater flow system and quantify the groundwater inflow rate three field campaigns were carried out in april 2018 september 2018 and february 2019 to determine the spatial and temporal variations in the 222rn activity the 222rn activities were significantly higher along the western boundary of the wetland than the eastern boundary suggesting a significant difference in the groundwater inflow rate which reflects different hydrological characteristics on the two boundaries of the wetland the results of hydrogeological investigations electrical resistivity survey and monitoring of groundwater and surface water levels and microbiological analyses were consistent with the 222rn distribution results supporting our hypothesis that the groundwater inflow qualitatively and quantitatively exhibits a spatial difference based on the mass balances of water and 222rn under a steady state condition the groundwater inflow rates were estimated to be 3 2 102 1 7 103 and 7 6 102 m3 day 1 in april september and february respectively the highest groundwater inflow rate in september may be due to the relatively high hydraulic gradient resulting from intense rainfall events the water residence time of the wetland estimated from the 222rn mass balance results was approximately one month regardless of the seasons in addition the groundwater derived dissolved silica flux accounted for 60 of the total dissolved silica input flux of the wetland highlighting the importance of groundwater derived dissolved silica our multidisciplinary approach to identify and quantify groundwater inflow has important implications in determining groundwater sources in aquatic systems and the behaviors of other substances such as dissolved nutrients keywords groundwater surface water interaction 222rn mass balance groundwater inflow rate residence time multidisciplinary investigation wetland 1 introduction understanding the groundwater surface water interaction in aquatic systems including rivers streams lakes and wetlands is essential for decision makers involved in water policy and the management and preservation of groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes boulton et al 1998 brunke and gonser 1997 cartwright and gilfedder 2015 chapman et al 2007 cook et al 2008 kløve et al 2011 shaw et al 2013 winter 1999 in these systems the groundwater surface water interaction plays an important role in the transport of pollutants nutrients colloids carbon and heat boulton et al 1998 cardenas and wilson 2007 packman and brooks 2001 for example in lake erie canada although the groundwater si p ratio is are a relatively minor driver of surface water si p groundwater derived silicon and phosphorus account for a significantly large portion of the overall fluxes maavara et al 2018 furthermore spatio temporal variations in the groundwater quality i e no3 po4 3 nh4 and mn of a shallow wetland were investigated based on information on wetland plant habitat conditions schot and pieber 2012 subsequently groundwater surface water interaction affects river and stream ecosystems in terms of the aquatic vegetation distribution and survival of animals malcolm et al 2004 meyer et al 2008 the groundwater inflow to aquatic systems can be evaluated using chemical physical and numerical methods kalbus et al 2006 sophocleous 2002 studies on groundwater surface water interaction in various gdes have been conducted using direct water flux measurements with a seepage meter lee 1977 methods based on darcy s law woessner 2000 groundwater modeling nyholm et al 2002 rodríguez et al 2006 and a heat tracer method bredehoeft and papaopulos 1965 environmental tracers including the water temperature electrical conductivity ec major ions stable isotopes 87sr 86sr δ18o and δ2h and thermal infrared imaging have been used to quantify the groundwater fluxes from subsurface to surface water banks et al 1996 cartwright and gilfedder 2015 hinkle et al 2001 lamontagne et al 2005 négrel and petelet giraud 2005 paces and wurster 2014 recently stable isotopes 18o and 2h 222rn ec hydrological modeling and water mass balance methods have been used to estimate groundwater inflow into wetlands and lakes gilfedder et al 2015 grundling et al 2015 maavara et al 2018 petermann et al 2018 trigg et al 2014 however in some cases the temperature and ec of groundwater are similar to those of surface water where evaporation mineral precipitation and biological processes may make it difficult to use stable isotope tracers because of the modification of the major ion chemistry and overlapping isotope ratios cartwright et al 2011 radon 222 222rn a radionuclide and noble gas is a member of the uranium 238 238u decay chain the 222rn activity in groundwater is typically 2 4 orders of magnitude higher than those in surface water reservoirs of streams lakes or wetlands because u is ubiquitous in nearly all sediments the 222rn in groundwater is in secular equilibrium with its parent 226ra for groundwater residence times longer than a month surface waters are 222rn depleted due to rapid degassing to the atmosphere there is usually no internal source of 222rn except for groundwater inflow in the aquatic system such as wetlands as a result 222rn has successfully been used in hydrology to trace fluid exchange between aquifers and surface water reservoirs recently wetlands have been recognized as important sources or sinks of chemical substances such as trace elements and nutrients qu et al 2017 telfeyan et al 2017 for wetlands in which groundwater inflows strongly influence hydrological cycles quantifying the groundwater inflow is necessary to understand their hydrogeological characteristics and the biogeochemical activities occurring within wetlands previous studies have investigated groundwater inflow into wetlands in terrestrial and coastal areas based on steady state and or transient mass balance approaches with natural tracers such as cl and 222rn berthot et al 2016 cook et al 2008 de weys et al 2011 rodellas et al 2012 zarroca et al 2014 only a few studies have assessed the groundwater inflow into wetlands where the surface water depth was very shallow or the portion of groundwater discharge was small relative to surface water mass cook et al 2008 gilfedder et al 2015 despite the importance of understanding groundwater inflow and quantifying its flux into wetlands performing analyses remains challenging because of geological and topographical heterogeneities therefore we applied the 222rn mass balance method along with a multidisciplinary approach including hydrological and microbiological methods to investigate the groundwater inflow into the baekseok reservoir wetland brw which is a shallow 1 m wetland and considered a gde furthermore we investigated the behavior of dissolved silica sio2 aq which is an essential nutrient for wetland organisms based on the estimated groundwater inflow rate 2 study area and methods 2 1 site description the brw is geographically located in the western part gunsan si jeollabuk province of the korean peninsula fig 1 the wetland was constructed in 1945 for agricultural irrigation since 2008 it has lost its function as a reservoir and has naturally become a wetland the brw appears to be y shaped with an area of 141 000 m2 with long and short axes of 588 and 560 m respectively fig 1 the surface sediment of the wetland is intertidal sediment because the wetland was built by blocking the levees at the mouth of the entrance based on drill core loggings fig s1 recorded during the installation of the groundwater monitoring wells b2 and b5 in fig 1 around the wetland the near surface is composed of reclamation soil containing silt and sand while the sedimentary layer is mainly composed of clay and fragments up to the upper part of the weathering zone the base rock underlying the surface sediment is composed of phyllite sericite schist biotite schist and quartzite based on the meteorological data recorded during a period of approximately 50 years 1968 2016 in the study region nwc 2016 the annual averages of the air temperature and precipitation are 12 7 c and 1216 mm yr 1 respectively the maximum average temperature occurred in august 25 7 c and the minimum in january 0 4 c during the same period the precipitation between june and september summer monsoon season accounts for 65 of the total annual precipitation the annual average wind speed is 3 5 m s 1 showing a constant value throughout the year the annual evaporation rate observed during the same period was 1 350 mm yr 1 showing that the maximum rate was observed in august 158 mm yr 1 and the minimum in january 54 mm yr 1 2 2 electrical resistivity surveys a 2 d electrical resistivity survey was conducted with an electrode spacing of 5 m to evaluate the distribution of the sedimentary layers i e clay sand and silt in the wetland we designed the survey lines at the wetland border and inside as shown in fig 2 the field survey was carried out using supersting r8 iptm advanced geosciences inc the resistivity data were only able to be obtained from one survey line inside the wetland in february 2019 because of the large amount of water inside the wetland at the time of the field survey the measured datasets were inverted using the dipro software kim 2001 the resistivity inversion results were interpreted with reference to the drill core loggings recorded around the survey lines 2 3 water level monitoring and surface outflow rate five groundwater monitoring wells were newly installed to monitor the groundwater levels the levels of groundwater b1 b5 and g7 in the newly installed groundwater monitoring wells and existing groundwater well respectively were measured every 5 min from may 2018 to february 2019 using ctd diver eijkelkamp soil water netherlands and baro diver eijkelkamp soil water netherlands for barometric correction fig 1 to measure the level of the surface water w3 and w5 ctd and baro diver were attached to a steel pipe installed within the wetland all obtained water levels were corrected by gps measurement to compare the levels of the groundwater and surface water as we lost the diver installed at w5 station and with the surface water level of the w5 showing a similar trend to that of w3 during the other days the surface water level of w5 from august to november 2018 was estimated based on the correlation between the water levels of w3 and w5 r 0 98 the measured groundwater levels at six monitoring wells were calculated using kriging interpolation method kriging z transform linear variogram model linear slope 1 aniso 1 0 kriging type point drift type none in surfer 12 golden software u s a the surface water velocity was directly measured using a propeller type current meter ott z400 near the s11 station only in april 2018 to estimate the surface water outflow rate the channel cross section was divided into several subsections where the individual subsection area was estimated by multiplying the water depth with the corresponding widths the total discharge was then calculated by summing the discharges at each subsection 2 4 water and sediment sampling the sampling campaigns for the surface water total 35 and porewater total 23 samples of the brw were conducted in april 2018 september 2018 and february 2019 during the sampling campaigns there was no significant surface runoff into the wetland a grab sample using a grab sampler glass bottle 4 l was collected at 12 sampling points s1 s12 fig 1 within the wetland to measure the 222rn activity in the surface water lee and kim 2006 to minimize the leakage of 222rn gas into air the sampling bottle was completely submerged in the surface water and capped after filling the bottle lee and kim 2006 zhang et al 2016 or the glass bottle was evacuated using a vacuum pump for 1 min before sampling the surface water oliveira et al 2003 stringer and burnett 2004 in addition surface water was collected at the same points to measure the dissolved silica concentration the porewater samples were collected from two sites pa and pc in fig 1 at multiple depths 20 40 60 80 and 100 cm this was done using a push point sampler charette and allen 2006 inserted into the shallow surficial aquifers and a peristaltic pump operating at a very low speed 10 ml min 1 to collect the porewater samples at each depth the sampling tube was flushed with diw 18 mω deionized water before collecting each sample the activity of 226ra half life 1600 years parent of 222rn in the surface water of the wetland was measured to develop the 222rn mass balance model approximately 100 l of the surface water was collected using a submersible pump and passed through a 16 g mn fiber at a flow rate of 1 5 l min 1 using a peristaltic pump to capture 226ra in the water samples moore and arnold 1996 the mn fiber was packed in an air tight al canister for more than three weeks to equilibrate 222rn and its daughters 214pb and 214bi with 226ra the sediment core samples 1 m for a microbial community analysis were collected from the b2 and b5 wells during well installation in june 2018 to compare the microbial communities at the western and eastern boundaries of the wetland the core samples were placed in sterile tubes and stored at 70 c until dna extraction 2 5 analytical methods the 222rn activity in the surface water samples was measured using an automated radon in air monitor rad7 durridge co u s a all the samples were analyzed in one day the surface water sampled by the grab sampler was connected with rad7 and the air was recirculated through a closed loop from the surface water sample into a rad7 in this study the 222rn activity was measured every 5 min for an hour for the same sample the 222rn activity was then manually calculated using the average 222rn activity considering the counting number counting time water temperature counting efficiency of rad7 and the volumes of water and air schubert et al 2012 the uncertainties of the measured 222rn activities were obtained on the basis of error propagation the detailed methods and calculations using the grab sampler are described in lee and kim 2006 and schubert et al 2012 the uncertainties in the 222rn measurement determined through error propagation were within 10 of the measured activities the temperature and ec were measured in situ using a portable sensor wtw multi 3420 wissenschaftlich technische werkstätten gmbh germany the 222rn activity in the porewater was analyzed using an ultra low level liquid scintillation counter wallac 1220 quantulus perkin elmer u s a the extraction efficiency of 226ra onto the mn fiber was not be obtained in this study but we used a reference value 70 for the 226ra extraction efficiency to correct the dissolved 226ra activity in the surface water based on a previous study lee et al 2009b the 226ra activity was analyzed using gamma spectrometry with an hpge detector canberra u s a based on previous studies lee et al 2009a 2000 the concentration of dissolved silica in the water samples was measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes optima 7300 dv perkin elmer u s a the analytical detection limit was 0 03 mg l 1 for dissolved silica genomic dna was extracted from the core samples using the dneasy powersoil kit qiagen hilden germany following the manufacturer s protocol and stored at 20 c until further analysis the genomic dna was amplified in the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene using the miseq platform illumina san diego u s a at macrogen seoul south korea callahan et al 2016 horton et al 2019 the raw sequence data were analyzed using qiime v 1 9 1 based on standard procedures caporaso et al 2010 2 6 radon 222 mass balance model a simple 222rn mass balance model under a steady state condition was applied to quantify the inflow rate of groundwater into the wetland this model has been used in many previous studies to estimate the groundwater discharge in terrestrial and coastal environments burnett and dulaiova 2003 sadat noori et al 2015 santos et al 2014 the mass balances of water and 222rn take the following equations 1 q in p a q gw q out e a 2 q in r n in q gw r n gw j diff r n a 226 r a λ 222 v q out r n out r n m λ 222 v f atm where qin m3 d 1 and qgw m3 d 1 are the surface inflow rate and groundwater inflow rate respectively qout m3 d 1 represents the combined surface water and groundwater outflow rate of the wetland p m d 1 is the average precipitation rate over five days prior to each sampling campaign and e m d 1 is the evaporation rate estimated using monthly data averaged over approximately 50 years 1968 2016 nwc 2016 here rnin rngw and rnout are the rn activities bq m 3 in the surface water inflow to the wetland groundwater discharged into the wetland and surface water outflow from the wetland respectively rnm bq m 3 is the average 222rn activity in the surface water and rnout is assumed to be the average of the 222rn activities in the surface water outflow at the s10 and s11 stations for each sampling campaign a m2 is the surface area of the wetland and v m3 is the volume of water within the wetland jdiff rn bq m 2 d 1 is the diffusive rate of 222rn from the sediment 226ra bq m 3 is the radium activity in the surface water and λ222 0 18 d 1 is the 222rn decay constant fatm is the loss term for 222rn due to atmospheric evasion the data pertaining to the weather parameters including air temperature precipitation rate and wind speed in the study area during the sampling campaigns were obtained from korea meteorological administration kma the diffusive flux of 222rn jdiff rn from the wetland sediment can be estimated using the relationship between jdiff rn and the 226ra activity of the sediments 226rased bq kg 1 burnett et al 2003 cockenpot et al 2015 3 j diff r n 0 495 226 r a sed 0 303 the 226ra activities of ten sediment samples in the brw ranged from 40 to 65 bq kg 1 with an average of 50 9 bq kg 1 fig s2 using this average we found jdiff rn to be 25 5 bq m 2 day 1 the average dissolved 226ra activity n 2 in the surface water after correction with the extraction efficient 70 of the mn fiber lee et al 2009b was 2 9 0 2 bq m 3 ranging from 2 1 0 2 to 3 6 0 4 bq m 3 the evasion flux fatm was calculated using the wind speed average of five days prior to the sampling date and water temperature data as follows 4 f atm a k c w α c air where k is the position velocity m day 1 α is the ostwald solubility dimensionless cw is the average 222rn activity bq m 3 in the surface water and cair 4 bq m 3 is the 222rn activity of air corbett et al 2000 santos and eyre 2011 to estimate the groundwater inflow rate into the wetland we used eqs 1 and 2 under a steady state condition table 1 lists the 222rn activities and fluxes of the 222rn sources and sinks used for the calculation we assumed that the surface inflow rate qin is negligible because no surface input was observed during the sampling campaigns and surface input water generally contains negligible 222rn we also assumed that there is no significant outflow through groundwater we assumed a steady state over a long period to sufficiently estimate the groundwater inflow rate using the 222rn mass balance we suggest that it is reasonable to estimate the groundwater inflow rate under a steady state condition in our study considering the residence times 3 5 days of 222rn in the surface water and no significant change in the levels of the surface water and groundwater during more than ten days after large rainfall events in september fig 3 moreover the average 222rn activity of the surface water rnm is assumed to be constant with respect to the water depth because the surface water may be vertically mixed well owing to a shallow surface water depth 0 3 m the water volume of the wetland is assumed to be constant because the surface water level showed no significant difference fig 3 d and e 3 results 3 1 hydrogeological characteristics 3 1 1 water level monitoring fig 3 shows the seasonal variations in the air temperature groundwater level of the monitoring wells b2 and b5 and levels of the surface water w3 and w5 from may 2018 to march 2019 the study area experienced several rainfall events more than 300 mm in july and 500 mm in august the groundwater and surface water levels rapidly increased during large rainfall events on july 1 2 and august 26 31 2018 with a variation of approximately 1 m the fact that the groundwater level responded rapidly to rainfall events indicates the characteristics of an unconfined aquifer in the wetland fig 4 a and b show the distributions of the regional groundwater level and flow direction using the groundwater level data obtained from six monitoring wells surrounding the wetland in september 2018 and february 2019 respectively the results indicate that the groundwater in this study area is recharged from the hilly terrains located in the northern and western parts and discharges through the southern parts of the wetland fig 4 shows that the groundwater flow directions exhibited a clear north south direction regardless of the seasons while the north southeast flow direction was stronger in september than february 3 1 2 electrical resistivity survey results the resistivity survey was conducted to investigate the underground structure sedimentary layers that governs the hydrogeological properties of the wetland fig 2 the resistivity results indicate that it is difficult to distinguish the reclamation soil and clay layers because of their low and similar electrical resistivity values among the resistivity survey lines lines 1 n and 3 e intersect the drilling position a comparison of the resistivity results from these survey lines with the drilling core logs shows that an inverted resistivity of approximately 70 ohm m tends to correspond with the depth of the sediments therefore we referred to the core logs to interpret the resistivity survey data survey lines 1 e and 2 e are located upstream of the wetland and in areas where groundwater may enter the wetland fig 5 a and c indicating that the sedimentary depth increases from the east to the west of each survey line lines 2 n and 4 n are adjacent to the parallel roads located on the east and west sides of the wetland high resistivity values are distributed from the surface at these lines because the road is located at the boundary with the surrounding mountains such that the depth of the sediment is likely to moderate fig 5 d and f survey line 3 e is located at the southwestern boundary of the wetland where the sedimentary depth is expected to be approximately 6 m near the borehole and greater toward the east fig 5 e as line 5 e is located on the embankment of the wetland we interpreted high resistivities at depths of 4 5 m from the reservoir embankment fig 5 h the lower part of line 5 e has a low resistivity value which is influenced by the clay layer a tidal zone formed at the wetland embankment thus the low resistivity values can be attributed to the effect of the clay layer which contains residual salt survey line 4 e was located within the wetland and was accessible by foot at the time of data acquisition the resistivity analysis results show that the resistivity decreases and that the depth of the low resistivity zone increases toward the west side of the wetland fig 5 g the low resistivity at station 15 14 along line 4 e can be attributed to the presence of a paleo channel the low resistivity at the lower part station 32 19 of line 4 e can be attributed to the wide distribution of the clay layer perhaps because of the relatively slower surface water flow in the western area than in the eastern area interestingly the resistivity results of line 4 e show that the sediment depth of the western boundary is relatively greater than that of the eastern boundary 3 2 spatial differences between the western and eastern boundaries 3 2 1 water level difference the water level difference between the surface water and groundwater was relatively larger in the western boundary b5 w5 than in the eastern boundary b2 w3 of the wetland fig 6 the groundwater level was higher than the surface water level at b5 indicating that groundwater discharges into the western boundary of the wetland despite a low rainfall season february 2019 in contrast to the western boundary the groundwater level was higher than the surface water level during the high rainfall season but lower during the drought season at the eastern boundary suggesting more active groundwater surface water exchange 3 2 2 microbial community composition fig 7 a and b show the archaeal and bacterial community compositions at the eastern b2 and western b5 boundaries respectively at the archaeal class level thaumarchaea widely distributed ammonia oxidizers found in diverse environments was abundant in both samples lehtovirta morley 2018 müller et al 2018 the miscellaneous crenarchaeotic group mcg which is relatively abundant in anoxic and low energy environments characterized by deeper sulfate depletion than other archaea kubo et al 2012 was observed only in sample b5 fig 7 a at the bacterial class level ktedonobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were abundant in the b2 sediment sample the ktedonobacteria class are aerobic bacteria ubiquitous in terrestrial environments characterized as a potential active producer of bioactive compounds zheng et al 2019 the obligate aerobic xanthomonadales the order within the gammaproteobacteria are agriculturally important bacteria that can survive in adverse conditions such as contaminated soil and hot springs bayer santos et al 2019 in contrast the b5 sediment sample showed a relatively higher abundance of deltaproteobacteria and anaerolineae than the b2 sediment sample the sulfate reducing bacteria which belong to deltaproteobacteria can perform anaerobic respiration utilizing sulfate as the terminal electron acceptor furthermore anaerolineae are core microorganisms in anaerobic digesters xia et al 2016 fig 7 b the archaeal and bacterial community compositions reveal that the sediment sample at the western boundary may be more anoxic than that at the eastern boundary resulting from anoxic groundwater inflow at the western boundary although microbial data did not provide quantitative results for groundwater flow these data can provide additional information on the overall groundwater flow systems and support the interpretation of the groundwater inflow rate estimated from the 222rn tracer 3 2 3 levels of 222rn and dissolved silica the measured 222rn activity in the surface water at 12 stations ranged from 18 to 1 3 104 bq m 3 average standard deviation 1 9 103 2 9 103 bq m 3 with a large spatial variation fig 8 the 222rn activities were lowest in the central s2 and s3 and southeastern s1 s10 and s11 parts and highest in the northern s5 and s6 and western s7 and s8 parts similar to the 222rn spatial distribution dissolved silica in the surface water showed relatively higher concentrations at the western boundary than the eastern boundary of the wetland fig 9 the dissolved silica concentration was highest at s7 4 4 9 1 mg l 1 and s8 4 9 10 8 mg l 1 and lowest at s1 0 9 6 8 mg l 1 and s12 1 4 6 3 mg l 1 during three sampling periods the 222rn activity in the porewater sampled at the eastern pa and western pc boundaries ranged from 9 2 102 to 2 2 104 bq m 3 with an average of 1 1 0 6 104 bq m 3 where the 222rn activity in the porewater was 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than that in the surface water fig 10 3 3 groundwater inflow rates and residence times with the assumptions mentioned in section 2 6 we simultaneously used eqs 1 and 2 to determine the two unknown terms qout and qgw table 1 the estimated groundwater inflow rate in september 2018 1 7 103 m3 day 1 was 5 3 and 2 4 times higher than those in april 2018 3 2 102 m3 day 1 and february 2019 7 6 102 m3 day 1 respectively these seasonal variations can be attributed to the concentrated rainfall in the summer season due to the monsoon climate and typhoons this is evidenced by the larger water level difference between the surface water and groundwater in september 2018 than that in february 2019 fig 6 in contrast to qgw qout was relatively constant ranging from 8 6 102 to 1 1 103 m3 day 1 although the surface water outflow rate was not obtained for all the campaigns the measured surface outflow rate in april 2018 was approximately 1 0 103 m3 day 1 which is similar to the estimated value 8 7 102 m3 day 1 using the 222rn mass balance model this indicates that the water in the wetland may discharge through surface outflow rather than through groundwater outflow the groundwater inflow rates estimated in our study are comparable to those of other studies cook et al 2008 gilfedder et al 2015 grundling et al 2015 hunt et al 1996 rodellas et al 2012 conducted in shallow 2 m wetlands using 222rn ra isotope mass balances and darcy s law table 2 the water residence time tw day of the wetland for each campaign was estimated using the total outflow or total inflow and water volume of the wetland 5 t w v q out the residence time is determined only by the change in the total outflow because the water volume of the wetland is assumed to be constant the estimated water residence times for each campaign are 28 24 and 36 days for april 2018 september 2018 and february 2019 respectively indicating that the water residence time is largely constant throughout the seasons using the 222rn flux through the sink processes i e evasion decay and outflow and 222rn inventory of the wetland we estimated the residence time of 222rn trn within as follows 6 t rn v rn m f atm f dec rn out q out the estimated residence times of 222rn for each campaign were 3 4 days for april 2018 4 3 days for september 2018 and 4 6 days for february 2019 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties and limitations throughout previous decades the groundwater inflow rate has been estimated using naturally occurring radionuclides including 222rn however uncertainties 100 remain when quantifying the groundwater discharge lee et al 2009b su et al 2011 the major uncertainty in our 222rn mass balance is related to the atmospheric evasion flux which accounts for 38 of the total 222rn losses and has approximately 30 uncertainty due to standard deviation of the wind speed on the other hand there is a minor effect of the uncertainties below 10 analytical error associated with the groundwater endmember because we used the maximum 222rn activity in the porewater of each season to reflect the seasonal variation in the 222rn activity in the porewater and estimate the minimum groundwater inflow the uncertainties of the diffusion flux production flux and decay flux are approximately 20 10 and 10 respectively the uncertainty of the diffusion flux mainly derived from the variation in the 226ra activities of the sediments which was 20 in our study the uncertainties associated with the production and decay fluxes mainly originated from the water volume of the wetland v overall our 222rn mass balance is highly sensitive to the evasion flux previous studies on groundwater discharges into lakes also reported that the evasion flux was the most sensitive term in the 222rn mass balance dimova et al 2013 the uncertainties in the groundwater inflow were estimated to be 16 for september and february and 27 for april based on the basic rules for error propagation although the spatial distributions of the 222rn activities in the surface water during three sampling campaigns were similar and well correlated to those of the dissolved silica concentration figs 8 and 9 our study may still have limitations with respect to the small number of surface water samples which may not be enough to be representative of the entire wetland system for the groundwater endmember used in the mass balance the wetland sediment was mainly composed of the thin silt and sand layer and thick clay layer based on the drill core loggings fig s1 suggesting that there is a high possibility that groundwater discharges into the wetland with long residence time such that the groundwater composition may change through the processes of radiometric decay regeneration and biogeochemistry furthermore the 222rn activities at deeper depths 80 100 cm did not change significantly fig 10 which is due to near equilibrium with the sediments therefore assuming that the groundwater may completely mix with the porewater before discharging into the wetland the 222rn and dissolved silica of the porewater were used as endmembers for the mass balances rather than those of the groundwater if we consider the average 222rn activities in the groundwater of the b2 8 9 2 3 104 bq m 3 and b5 7 9 3 1 104 bq m 3 wells table s1 as the groundwater endmember the groundwater inflow rate will be 4 5 times lower 4 2 conceptual model fig 11 shows a schematic cross section west east of a conceptual model of the brw we compared the groundwater inflow at the eastern b2 and western b5 boundaries through the conceptual model in general the 222rn activities in the surface water were relatively higher at the western boundary than at the eastern boundary these results suggest a higher groundwater inflow rate at the western boundary that at the eastern boundary despite the fact that we could not obtain direct evidence of a higher groundwater inflow due to a lack of hydraulic conductivity data in addition similar spatial trends in the dissolved silica in the surface water can support a high groundwater inflow rate at the western boundary the hydrological results for the wetland based on the water level differences and geophysical survey also suggest that the groundwater inflow rate is generally higher at the western boundary than the eastern boundary however data from borehole samples showed a thick clay layer more than 4 m at both b2 and b5 fig s1 therefore another possibility for the higher groundwater inflow rate at b2 is shallow groundwater discharge through the silt and sand layers the data from the borehole samples revealed that the silt and sand layer at b5 0 1 3 m is thicker than that at b2 0 0 7 m while the clay layer is relatively thinner at b5 compared with b2 these results suggest the possibility that the higher groundwater inflow could have been due to the shallow groundwater at b5 although the type of groundwater inflow regional or shallow could not be identified in this study for the porewater as the measured 226ra contents in the sediments at multiple depths at the pa and pc stations were almost constant fig s2 there may be no significant effect of diffusion from sediments additionally the continuous increase in the 222rn activity with depths of up to 60 cm may indicate active and significant groundwater surface water interaction in the wetland 4 3 groundwater derived dissolved silica flux the dissolved silica concentrations in the surface water and porewater show a significant correlation n 42 r 0 63 p 0 05 with the 222rn activity fig 12 suggesting that dissolved silica coupled with 222rn can be used for groundwater studies although the two tracers behave differently in terrestrial aquatic systems in this study however the dissolved silica mass balance could not be applied to quantify the groundwater inflow rate because of unknown terms such as the si production flux due to the dissolution of reactive particulate si to dissolved silica and the si removal flux due to biological uptake therefore using the groundwater inflow qgw and surface water outflow qout rates estimated from eqs 1 and 2 we constructed the dissolved silica mass balance for the wetland water as follows 7 q in s i in q gw s i gw j diff s i a q out s i out f net 8 f net f rem f pro where siin and siout are the dissolved silica concentrations mg l 1 of the surface inflow and outflow respectively and sigw is the average dissolved silica concentration in the porewater for each season the diffusive flux of dissolved silica from the wetland sediment was estimated using the reported diffusion rate jdiff rn of si of the clay sediment multiplied by the area a of the wetland kim and park 2003 here fnet mg day 1 is the balancing unidentified dissolved silica flux frem is the dissolved silica removal flux due to biological uptake and fpro is the dissolved silica production flux due to the dissolution of reactive particulate si to dissolved silica maavara et al 2018 table s2 lists the values of each term used in the si mass balance we neglected surface water inflow qin because there was no significant surface inflow the groundwater derived dissolved silica flux qgwsigw was calculated by multiplying the groundwater inflow rate estimated from the 222rn mass balance by the dissolved silica concentration in the porewater using eq 7 the groundwater derived dissolved silica fluxes were estimated to be 4 3 1 2 106 3 0 0 5 107 and 9 6 1 5 106 mg day 1 for april september and february respectively the uncertainties of the groundwater derived dissolved silica flux mainly derived from the uncertainty of the estimated groundwater inflow rates importantly the dissolved silica flux associated with the groundwater inflow accounted for 60 september 2018 of the total dissolved silica input flux suggesting that groundwater derived dissolved silica is the important source of dissolved silica in the wetland water the fnet values were estimated to be 2 3 4 5 and 2 7 107 mg day 1 for april september and february respectively this suggests that the dissolved silica removal flux is relatively higher than the dissolved silica production rate in the wetland regardless of seasons although we could not quantify fpro and frem in this study as such the groundwater inflow rate estimated using 222rn as a groundwater tracer can be used to determine the behavior cycle and transport of other elements 5 conclusions we conducted hydrogeological investigations microbiological analyses and a 222rn mass balance to quantitatively and qualitatively assess groundwater inflow in a shallow wetland these techniques have limitations and strengths for their applications for example the 222rn mass balance can quantify the groundwater inflow rate despite large uncertainties and some assumptions all results from the various methods used in our study suggest that there is a distinguishable spatial difference in the groundwater inflow rate in the wetland our multidisciplinary approach can provide complementary information on the groundwater flow system in complex groundwater surface water mixing zones and groundwater dependent systems furthermore these approaches including the quantification of the groundwater inflow are useful for understanding and evaluating behaviors and mass exchanges of dissolved substances induced by groundwater surface water interactions in various aquatic systems credit authorship contribution statement

5105,studying groundwater inflow and quantifying its flux into aquatic systems remain challenging because of geological and topographical heterogeneities in this study we measured the 222rn activities in the surface water and porewater of a shallow wetland the baekseok reservoir wetland to investigate the groundwater flow system and quantify the groundwater inflow rate three field campaigns were carried out in april 2018 september 2018 and february 2019 to determine the spatial and temporal variations in the 222rn activity the 222rn activities were significantly higher along the western boundary of the wetland than the eastern boundary suggesting a significant difference in the groundwater inflow rate which reflects different hydrological characteristics on the two boundaries of the wetland the results of hydrogeological investigations electrical resistivity survey and monitoring of groundwater and surface water levels and microbiological analyses were consistent with the 222rn distribution results supporting our hypothesis that the groundwater inflow qualitatively and quantitatively exhibits a spatial difference based on the mass balances of water and 222rn under a steady state condition the groundwater inflow rates were estimated to be 3 2 102 1 7 103 and 7 6 102 m3 day 1 in april september and february respectively the highest groundwater inflow rate in september may be due to the relatively high hydraulic gradient resulting from intense rainfall events the water residence time of the wetland estimated from the 222rn mass balance results was approximately one month regardless of the seasons in addition the groundwater derived dissolved silica flux accounted for 60 of the total dissolved silica input flux of the wetland highlighting the importance of groundwater derived dissolved silica our multidisciplinary approach to identify and quantify groundwater inflow has important implications in determining groundwater sources in aquatic systems and the behaviors of other substances such as dissolved nutrients keywords groundwater surface water interaction 222rn mass balance groundwater inflow rate residence time multidisciplinary investigation wetland 1 introduction understanding the groundwater surface water interaction in aquatic systems including rivers streams lakes and wetlands is essential for decision makers involved in water policy and the management and preservation of groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes boulton et al 1998 brunke and gonser 1997 cartwright and gilfedder 2015 chapman et al 2007 cook et al 2008 kløve et al 2011 shaw et al 2013 winter 1999 in these systems the groundwater surface water interaction plays an important role in the transport of pollutants nutrients colloids carbon and heat boulton et al 1998 cardenas and wilson 2007 packman and brooks 2001 for example in lake erie canada although the groundwater si p ratio is are a relatively minor driver of surface water si p groundwater derived silicon and phosphorus account for a significantly large portion of the overall fluxes maavara et al 2018 furthermore spatio temporal variations in the groundwater quality i e no3 po4 3 nh4 and mn of a shallow wetland were investigated based on information on wetland plant habitat conditions schot and pieber 2012 subsequently groundwater surface water interaction affects river and stream ecosystems in terms of the aquatic vegetation distribution and survival of animals malcolm et al 2004 meyer et al 2008 the groundwater inflow to aquatic systems can be evaluated using chemical physical and numerical methods kalbus et al 2006 sophocleous 2002 studies on groundwater surface water interaction in various gdes have been conducted using direct water flux measurements with a seepage meter lee 1977 methods based on darcy s law woessner 2000 groundwater modeling nyholm et al 2002 rodríguez et al 2006 and a heat tracer method bredehoeft and papaopulos 1965 environmental tracers including the water temperature electrical conductivity ec major ions stable isotopes 87sr 86sr δ18o and δ2h and thermal infrared imaging have been used to quantify the groundwater fluxes from subsurface to surface water banks et al 1996 cartwright and gilfedder 2015 hinkle et al 2001 lamontagne et al 2005 négrel and petelet giraud 2005 paces and wurster 2014 recently stable isotopes 18o and 2h 222rn ec hydrological modeling and water mass balance methods have been used to estimate groundwater inflow into wetlands and lakes gilfedder et al 2015 grundling et al 2015 maavara et al 2018 petermann et al 2018 trigg et al 2014 however in some cases the temperature and ec of groundwater are similar to those of surface water where evaporation mineral precipitation and biological processes may make it difficult to use stable isotope tracers because of the modification of the major ion chemistry and overlapping isotope ratios cartwright et al 2011 radon 222 222rn a radionuclide and noble gas is a member of the uranium 238 238u decay chain the 222rn activity in groundwater is typically 2 4 orders of magnitude higher than those in surface water reservoirs of streams lakes or wetlands because u is ubiquitous in nearly all sediments the 222rn in groundwater is in secular equilibrium with its parent 226ra for groundwater residence times longer than a month surface waters are 222rn depleted due to rapid degassing to the atmosphere there is usually no internal source of 222rn except for groundwater inflow in the aquatic system such as wetlands as a result 222rn has successfully been used in hydrology to trace fluid exchange between aquifers and surface water reservoirs recently wetlands have been recognized as important sources or sinks of chemical substances such as trace elements and nutrients qu et al 2017 telfeyan et al 2017 for wetlands in which groundwater inflows strongly influence hydrological cycles quantifying the groundwater inflow is necessary to understand their hydrogeological characteristics and the biogeochemical activities occurring within wetlands previous studies have investigated groundwater inflow into wetlands in terrestrial and coastal areas based on steady state and or transient mass balance approaches with natural tracers such as cl and 222rn berthot et al 2016 cook et al 2008 de weys et al 2011 rodellas et al 2012 zarroca et al 2014 only a few studies have assessed the groundwater inflow into wetlands where the surface water depth was very shallow or the portion of groundwater discharge was small relative to surface water mass cook et al 2008 gilfedder et al 2015 despite the importance of understanding groundwater inflow and quantifying its flux into wetlands performing analyses remains challenging because of geological and topographical heterogeneities therefore we applied the 222rn mass balance method along with a multidisciplinary approach including hydrological and microbiological methods to investigate the groundwater inflow into the baekseok reservoir wetland brw which is a shallow 1 m wetland and considered a gde furthermore we investigated the behavior of dissolved silica sio2 aq which is an essential nutrient for wetland organisms based on the estimated groundwater inflow rate 2 study area and methods 2 1 site description the brw is geographically located in the western part gunsan si jeollabuk province of the korean peninsula fig 1 the wetland was constructed in 1945 for agricultural irrigation since 2008 it has lost its function as a reservoir and has naturally become a wetland the brw appears to be y shaped with an area of 141 000 m2 with long and short axes of 588 and 560 m respectively fig 1 the surface sediment of the wetland is intertidal sediment because the wetland was built by blocking the levees at the mouth of the entrance based on drill core loggings fig s1 recorded during the installation of the groundwater monitoring wells b2 and b5 in fig 1 around the wetland the near surface is composed of reclamation soil containing silt and sand while the sedimentary layer is mainly composed of clay and fragments up to the upper part of the weathering zone the base rock underlying the surface sediment is composed of phyllite sericite schist biotite schist and quartzite based on the meteorological data recorded during a period of approximately 50 years 1968 2016 in the study region nwc 2016 the annual averages of the air temperature and precipitation are 12 7 c and 1216 mm yr 1 respectively the maximum average temperature occurred in august 25 7 c and the minimum in january 0 4 c during the same period the precipitation between june and september summer monsoon season accounts for 65 of the total annual precipitation the annual average wind speed is 3 5 m s 1 showing a constant value throughout the year the annual evaporation rate observed during the same period was 1 350 mm yr 1 showing that the maximum rate was observed in august 158 mm yr 1 and the minimum in january 54 mm yr 1 2 2 electrical resistivity surveys a 2 d electrical resistivity survey was conducted with an electrode spacing of 5 m to evaluate the distribution of the sedimentary layers i e clay sand and silt in the wetland we designed the survey lines at the wetland border and inside as shown in fig 2 the field survey was carried out using supersting r8 iptm advanced geosciences inc the resistivity data were only able to be obtained from one survey line inside the wetland in february 2019 because of the large amount of water inside the wetland at the time of the field survey the measured datasets were inverted using the dipro software kim 2001 the resistivity inversion results were interpreted with reference to the drill core loggings recorded around the survey lines 2 3 water level monitoring and surface outflow rate five groundwater monitoring wells were newly installed to monitor the groundwater levels the levels of groundwater b1 b5 and g7 in the newly installed groundwater monitoring wells and existing groundwater well respectively were measured every 5 min from may 2018 to february 2019 using ctd diver eijkelkamp soil water netherlands and baro diver eijkelkamp soil water netherlands for barometric correction fig 1 to measure the level of the surface water w3 and w5 ctd and baro diver were attached to a steel pipe installed within the wetland all obtained water levels were corrected by gps measurement to compare the levels of the groundwater and surface water as we lost the diver installed at w5 station and with the surface water level of the w5 showing a similar trend to that of w3 during the other days the surface water level of w5 from august to november 2018 was estimated based on the correlation between the water levels of w3 and w5 r 0 98 the measured groundwater levels at six monitoring wells were calculated using kriging interpolation method kriging z transform linear variogram model linear slope 1 aniso 1 0 kriging type point drift type none in surfer 12 golden software u s a the surface water velocity was directly measured using a propeller type current meter ott z400 near the s11 station only in april 2018 to estimate the surface water outflow rate the channel cross section was divided into several subsections where the individual subsection area was estimated by multiplying the water depth with the corresponding widths the total discharge was then calculated by summing the discharges at each subsection 2 4 water and sediment sampling the sampling campaigns for the surface water total 35 and porewater total 23 samples of the brw were conducted in april 2018 september 2018 and february 2019 during the sampling campaigns there was no significant surface runoff into the wetland a grab sample using a grab sampler glass bottle 4 l was collected at 12 sampling points s1 s12 fig 1 within the wetland to measure the 222rn activity in the surface water lee and kim 2006 to minimize the leakage of 222rn gas into air the sampling bottle was completely submerged in the surface water and capped after filling the bottle lee and kim 2006 zhang et al 2016 or the glass bottle was evacuated using a vacuum pump for 1 min before sampling the surface water oliveira et al 2003 stringer and burnett 2004 in addition surface water was collected at the same points to measure the dissolved silica concentration the porewater samples were collected from two sites pa and pc in fig 1 at multiple depths 20 40 60 80 and 100 cm this was done using a push point sampler charette and allen 2006 inserted into the shallow surficial aquifers and a peristaltic pump operating at a very low speed 10 ml min 1 to collect the porewater samples at each depth the sampling tube was flushed with diw 18 mω deionized water before collecting each sample the activity of 226ra half life 1600 years parent of 222rn in the surface water of the wetland was measured to develop the 222rn mass balance model approximately 100 l of the surface water was collected using a submersible pump and passed through a 16 g mn fiber at a flow rate of 1 5 l min 1 using a peristaltic pump to capture 226ra in the water samples moore and arnold 1996 the mn fiber was packed in an air tight al canister for more than three weeks to equilibrate 222rn and its daughters 214pb and 214bi with 226ra the sediment core samples 1 m for a microbial community analysis were collected from the b2 and b5 wells during well installation in june 2018 to compare the microbial communities at the western and eastern boundaries of the wetland the core samples were placed in sterile tubes and stored at 70 c until dna extraction 2 5 analytical methods the 222rn activity in the surface water samples was measured using an automated radon in air monitor rad7 durridge co u s a all the samples were analyzed in one day the surface water sampled by the grab sampler was connected with rad7 and the air was recirculated through a closed loop from the surface water sample into a rad7 in this study the 222rn activity was measured every 5 min for an hour for the same sample the 222rn activity was then manually calculated using the average 222rn activity considering the counting number counting time water temperature counting efficiency of rad7 and the volumes of water and air schubert et al 2012 the uncertainties of the measured 222rn activities were obtained on the basis of error propagation the detailed methods and calculations using the grab sampler are described in lee and kim 2006 and schubert et al 2012 the uncertainties in the 222rn measurement determined through error propagation were within 10 of the measured activities the temperature and ec were measured in situ using a portable sensor wtw multi 3420 wissenschaftlich technische werkstätten gmbh germany the 222rn activity in the porewater was analyzed using an ultra low level liquid scintillation counter wallac 1220 quantulus perkin elmer u s a the extraction efficiency of 226ra onto the mn fiber was not be obtained in this study but we used a reference value 70 for the 226ra extraction efficiency to correct the dissolved 226ra activity in the surface water based on a previous study lee et al 2009b the 226ra activity was analyzed using gamma spectrometry with an hpge detector canberra u s a based on previous studies lee et al 2009a 2000 the concentration of dissolved silica in the water samples was measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes optima 7300 dv perkin elmer u s a the analytical detection limit was 0 03 mg l 1 for dissolved silica genomic dna was extracted from the core samples using the dneasy powersoil kit qiagen hilden germany following the manufacturer s protocol and stored at 20 c until further analysis the genomic dna was amplified in the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene using the miseq platform illumina san diego u s a at macrogen seoul south korea callahan et al 2016 horton et al 2019 the raw sequence data were analyzed using qiime v 1 9 1 based on standard procedures caporaso et al 2010 2 6 radon 222 mass balance model a simple 222rn mass balance model under a steady state condition was applied to quantify the inflow rate of groundwater into the wetland this model has been used in many previous studies to estimate the groundwater discharge in terrestrial and coastal environments burnett and dulaiova 2003 sadat noori et al 2015 santos et al 2014 the mass balances of water and 222rn take the following equations 1 q in p a q gw q out e a 2 q in r n in q gw r n gw j diff r n a 226 r a λ 222 v q out r n out r n m λ 222 v f atm where qin m3 d 1 and qgw m3 d 1 are the surface inflow rate and groundwater inflow rate respectively qout m3 d 1 represents the combined surface water and groundwater outflow rate of the wetland p m d 1 is the average precipitation rate over five days prior to each sampling campaign and e m d 1 is the evaporation rate

discharged into the wetland and surface water outflow from the wetland respectively rnm bq m 3 is the average 222rn activity in the surface water and rnout is assumed to be the average of the 222rn activities in the surface water outflow at the s10 and s11 stations for each sampling campaign a m2 is the surface area of the wetland and v m3 is the volume of water within the wetland jdiff rn bq m 2 d 1 is the diffusive rate of 222rn from the sediment 226ra bq m 3 is the radium activity in the surface water and λ222 0 18 d 1 is the 222rn decay constant fatm is the loss term for 222rn due to atmospheric evasion the data pertaining to the weather parameters including air temperature precipitation rate and wind speed in the study area during the sampling campaigns were obtained from korea meteorological administration kma the diffusive flux of 222rn jdiff rn from the wetland sediment can be estimated using the relationship between jdiff rn and the 226ra activity of the sediments 226rased bq kg 1 burnett et al 2003 cockenpot et al 2015 3 j diff r n 0 495 226 r a sed 0 303 the 226ra activities of ten sediment samples in the brw ranged from 40 to 65 bq kg 1 with an average of 50

cair 4 bq m 3 is the 222rn activity of air corbett et al 2000 santos and eyre 2011 to estimate the groundwater inflow rate into the wetland we used eqs 1 and 2 under a steady state condition table 1 lists the 222rn activities and fluxes of the 222rn sources and sinks used for the calculation we assumed that the surface inflow rate qin is negligible because no surface input was observed during the sampling campaigns and surface input water generally contains negligible 222rn we also assumed that there is no significant outflow through groundwater we assumed a steady state over a long period to sufficiently estimate the groundwater inflow rate using the 222rn mass balance we suggest that it is reasonable to estimate the groundwater inflow rate under a steady state condition in our study considering the residence times 3 5 days of 222rn in the surface water and no significant change in the levels of the surface water and groundwater during more than ten days after large rainfall events in september fig 3 moreover the average 222rn activity of the surface water rnm is assumed to be constant with respect to the water depth because the surface water may be vertically mixed well owing to a shallow surface water depth 0 3 m the water volume of the wetland is assumed to be constant because the surface water level showed no significant difference fig 3 d and e 3 results 3 1 hydrogeological characteristics 3 1 1 water level monitoring fig 3 shows the seasonal variations in the air temperature groundwater level of the monitoring wells b2 and b5 and levels of the surface water w3 and w5 from may 2018 to march 2019 the study area experienced several rainfall events more than 300 mm in july and 500 mm in august the groundwater and surface water levels rapidly increased during large rainfall events on july 1 2 and august 26 31 2018 with a variation of approximately 1 m the fact that the groundwater level responded rapidly to rainfall events indicates the characteristics of an unconfined aquifer in the wetland fig 4 a and b show the distributions of the regional groundwater level and flow direction using the groundwater level data obtained from six monitoring wells surrounding the wetland in september 2018 and february 2019 respectively the results indicate that the groundwater in this study area is recharged from the hilly terrains located in the northern and western parts and discharges through the southern parts of the wetland fig 4 shows that the groundwater flow directions exhibited a clear north south direction regardless of the seasons while the north southeast flow direction was stronger in september than february 3 1 2 electrical resistivity survey results the resistivity survey was conducted to investigate the underground structure sedimentary layers that governs the hydrogeological properties of the wetland fig 2 the resistivity results indicate that it is difficult to distinguish the reclamation soil and clay layers because of their low and similar electrical resistivity values among the resistivity survey lines lines 1 n and 3 e intersect the drilling position a comparison of the resistivity results from these survey lines with the drilling core logs shows that an inverted resistivity of approximately 70 ohm m tends to correspond with the depth of the sediments therefore we referred to the core logs to interpret the resistivity survey data survey lines 1 e and 2 e are located upstream of the wetland and in areas where groundwater may enter the wetland fig 5 a and c indicating that the sedimentary depth increases from the east to the west of each survey line lines 2 n and 4 n are adjacent to the parallel roads located on the east and west sides of the wetland high resistivity values are distributed from the surface at these lines because the road is located at the boundary with the surrounding mountains such that the depth of the sediment is likely to moderate fig 5 d and f survey line 3 e is located at the southwestern boundary of the wetland where the sedimentary depth is expected to be approximately 6 m near the borehole and greater toward the east fig 5 e as line 5 e is located on the embankment of the wetland we interpreted high resistivities at depths of 4 5 m from the reservoir embankment fig 5 h the lower part of line 5 e has a low resistivity value which is influenced by the clay layer a tidal zone formed at the wetland embankment thus the low resistivity values can be attributed to the effect of the clay layer which contains residual salt survey line 4 e was located within the wetland and was accessible by foot at the time of data acquisition the resistivity analysis results show that the resistivity decreases and that the depth of the low resistivity zone increases toward the west side of the wetland fig 5 g the low resistivity at station 15 14 along line 4 e can be attributed to the presence of a paleo channel the low resistivity at the lower part station 32 19 of line 4 e can be attributed to the wide distribution of the clay layer perhaps because of the relatively slower surface water flow in the western area than in the eastern area interestingly the resistivity results of line 4 e show that the sediment depth of the western boundary is relatively greater than that of the eastern boundary 3 2 spatial differences between the western and eastern boundaries 3 2 1 water level difference the water level difference between the surface water and groundwater was relatively larger in the western boundary b5 w5 than in the eastern boundary b2 w3 of the wetland fig 6 the groundwater level was higher than the surface water level at b5 indicating that groundwater discharges into the western boundary of the wetland despite a low rainfall season february 2019 in contrast to the western boundary the groundwater level was higher than the surface water level during the high rainfall season but lower during the drought season at the eastern boundary suggesting more active groundwater surface water exchange 3 2 2 microbial community composition fig 7 a and b show the archaeal and bacterial community compositions at the eastern b2 and western b5 boundaries respectively at the archaeal class level thaumarchaea widely distributed ammonia oxidizers found in diverse environments was abundant in both samples lehtovirta morley 2018 müller et al 2018 the miscellaneous crenarchaeotic group mcg which is relatively abundant in anoxic and low energy environments characterized by deeper sulfate depletion than other archaea kubo et al 2012 was observed only in sample b5 fig 7 a at the bacterial class level ktedonobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were abundant in the b2 sediment sample the ktedonobacteria class are aerobic bacteria ubiquitous in terrestrial environments characterized as a potential active producer of bioactive compounds zheng et al 2019 the obligate aerobic xanthomonadales the order within the gammaproteobacteria are agriculturally important bacteria that can survive in adverse conditions such as contaminated soil and hot springs bayer santos et al 2019 in contrast the b5 sediment sample showed a relatively higher abundance of deltaproteobacteria and anaerolineae than the b2 sediment sample the sulfate reducing bacteria which belong to deltaproteobacteria can perform anaerobic respiration utilizing sulfate as the terminal electron acceptor furthermore anaerolineae are core microorganisms in anaerobic digesters xia et al 2016 fig 7 b the archaeal and bacterial community compositions reveal that the sediment sample at the western boundary may be more anoxic than that at the eastern boundary resulting from anoxic groundwater inflow at the western boundary although microbial data did not provide quantitative results for groundwater flow these data can provide additional information on the overall groundwater flow systems and support the interpretation of the groundwater inflow rate estimated from the 222rn tracer 3 2 3 levels of 222rn and dissolved silica the measured 222rn activity in the surface water at 12 stations ranged from 18 to 1 3 104 bq m 3 average standard deviation 1 9 103 2 9 103 bq m 3 with a large spatial variation fig 8 the 222rn activities were lowest in the central s2 and s3 and southeastern s1 s10 and s11 parts and highest in the northern s5 and s6 and western s7 and s8 parts similar to the 222rn spatial distribution dissolved silica in the surface water showed relatively higher concentrations at the western boundary than the eastern boundary of the wetland fig 9 the dissolved silica concentration was highest at s7 4 4 9 1 mg l 1 and s8 4 9 10 8 mg l 1 and lowest at s1 0 9 6 8 mg l 1 and s12 1 4 6 3 mg l 1 during three sampling periods the 222rn activity in the porewater sampled at the eastern pa and western pc boundaries ranged from 9 2 102 to 2 2 104 bq m 3 with an average of 1 1 0 6 104 bq m 3 where the 222rn activity in the porewater was 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than that in the surface water fig 10 3 3 groundwater inflow rates and residence times with the assumptions mentioned in section 2 6 we simultaneously used eqs 1 and 2 to determine the two unknown terms qout and qgw table 1 the estimated groundwater inflow rate in september 2018 1 7 103 m3 day 1 was 5 3 and 2 4 times higher than those in april 2018 3 2 102 m3 day 1 and february 2019 7 6 102 m3 day 1 respectively these seasonal variations can be attributed to the concentrated rainfall in the summer season due to the monsoon climate and typhoons this is evidenced by the larger water level difference between the surface water and groundwater in september 2018 than that in february 2019 fig 6 in contrast to qgw qout was relatively constant ranging from 8 6 102 to 1 1 103 m3 day 1 although the surface water outflow rate was not obtained for all the campaigns the measured surface outflow rate in april 2018 was approximately 1 0 103 m3 day 1 which is similar to the estimated value 8 7 102 m3 day 1 using the 222rn mass balance model this indicates that the water in the wetland may discharge through surface outflow rather than through groundwater outflow the groundwater inflow rates estimated in our study are comparable to those of other studies cook et al 2008 gilfedder et al 2015 grundling et al 2015 hunt et al 1996 rodellas et al 2012 conducted in shallow 2 m wetlands using 222rn ra isotope mass balances and darcy s law table 2 the water residence time tw day of the wetland for each campaign was estimated using the total outflow or total inflow and water volume of the wetland 5 t w v q out the residence time is determined only by the change in the total outflow because the water volume of the wetland is assumed to be constant the estimated water residence times for each campaign are 28 24 and 36 days for april 2018 september 2018 and february 2019 respectively indicating that the water residence time is largely constant throughout the seasons using the 222rn flux through the sink processes i e evasion decay and outflow and 222rn inventory of the wetland we estimated the residence time of 222rn trn within as follows 6 t rn v rn m f atm f dec rn out q out the estimated residence times of 222rn for each campaign were 3 4 days for april 2018 4 3 days for september 2018 and 4 6 days for february 2019 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties and limitations throughout previous decades the groundwater inflow rate has been estimated using naturally occurring radionuclides including 222rn however uncertainties 100 remain when quantifying the groundwater discharge lee et al 2009b su et al 2011 the major uncertainty in our 222rn mass balance is related to the atmospheric evasion flux which accounts for 38 of the total 222rn losses and has approximately 30 uncertainty due to standard deviation of the wind speed on the other hand there is a minor effect of the uncertainties below 10 analytical error associated with the groundwater endmember because we used the maximum 222rn activity in the porewater of each season to reflect the seasonal variation in the 222rn activity in the porewater and estimate the minimum groundwater inflow the uncertainties of the diffusion flux production flux and decay flux are approximately 20 10 and 10 respectively the uncertainty of the diffusion flux mainly derived from the variation in the 226ra activities of the sediments which was 20 in our study the uncertainties associated with the production and decay fluxes mainly originated from the water volume of the wetland v overall our 222rn mass balance is highly sensitive to the evasion flux previous studies on groundwater discharges into lakes also reported that the evasion flux was the most sensitive term in the 222rn mass balance dimova et al 2013 the uncertainties in the groundwater inflow were estimated to be 16 for september and february and 27 for april based on the basic rules for error propagation although the spatial distributions of the 222rn activities in the surface water during three sampling campaigns were similar and well correlated to those of the dissolved silica concentration figs 8 and 9 our study may still have limitations with respect to the small number of surface water samples which may not be enough to be representative of the entire wetland system for the groundwater endmember used in the mass balance the wetland sediment was mainly composed of the thin silt and sand layer and thick clay layer based on the drill core loggings fig s1 suggesting that there is a high possibility that groundwater discharges into the wetland with long residence time such that the groundwater composition may change through the processes of radiometric decay regeneration and biogeochemistry furthermore the 222rn activities at deeper depths 80 100 cm did not change significantly fig 10 which is due to near equilibrium with the sediments therefore assuming that the groundwater may completely mix with the porewater before discharging into the wetland the 222rn and dissolved silica of the porewater were used as endmembers for the mass balances rather than those of the groundwater if we consider the average 222rn activities in the groundwater of the b2 8 9 2 3 104 bq m 3 and b5 7 9 3 1 104 bq m 3 wells table s1 as the groundwater endmember the groundwater inflow rate will be 4 5 times lower 4 2 conceptual model fig 11 shows a schematic cross section west east of a conceptual model of the brw we compared the groundwater inflow at the eastern b2 and western b5 boundaries through the conceptual model in general the 222rn activities in the surface water were relatively higher at the western boundary than at the eastern boundary these results suggest a higher groundwater inflow rate at the western boundary that at the eastern boundary despite the fact that we could not obtain direct evidence of a higher groundwater inflow due to a lack of hydraulic conductivity data in addition similar spatial trends in the dissolved silica in the surface water can support a high groundwater inflow rate at the western boundary the hydrological results for the wetland based on the water level differences and geophysical survey also suggest that the groundwater inflow rate is generally higher at the western boundary than the eastern boundary however data from borehole samples showed a thick clay layer more than 4 m at both b2 and b5 fig s1 therefore another possibility for the higher groundwater inflow rate at b2 is shallow groundwater discharge through the silt and sand layers the data from the borehole samples revealed that the silt and sand layer at b5 0 1 3 m is thicker than that at b2 0 0 7 m while the clay layer is relatively thinner at b5 compared with b2 these results suggest the possibility that the higher groundwater inflow could have been due to the shallow groundwater at b5 although the type of groundwater inflow regional or shallow could not be identified in this study for the porewater as the measured 226ra contents in the sediments at multiple depths at the pa and pc stations were almost constant fig s2 there may be no significant effect of diffusion from sediments additionally the continuous increase in the 222rn activity with depths of up to 60 cm may indicate active and significant groundwater surface water interaction in the wetland 4 3 groundwater derived dissolved silica flux the dissolved silica concentrations in the surface water and porewater show a significant correlation n 42 r 0 63 p 0 05 with the 222rn activity fig 12 suggesting that dissolved silica coupled with 222rn can be used for groundwater studies although the two tracers behave differently in terrestrial aquatic systems in this study however the dissolved silica mass balance could not be applied to quantify the groundwater inflow rate because of unknown terms such as the si production flux due to the dissolution of reactive particulate si to dissolved silica and the si removal flux due to biological uptake therefore using the groundwater inflow qgw and surface water outflow qout rates estimated from eqs 1 and 2 we constructed the dissolved silica mass balance for the wetland water as follows 7 q in s i in q gw s i gw j diff s i a q out s i out f net 8 f net f rem f pro where siin and siout are the dissolved silica concentrations mg l 1 of the surface inflow and outflow respectively and sigw is the average dissolved silica concentration in the porewater for each season the diffusive flux of dissolved silica from the wetland sediment was estimated using the reported diffusion rate jdiff rn of si of the clay sediment multiplied by the area a of the wetland kim and park 2003 here fnet mg day 1 is the balancing unidentified dissolved silica flux frem is the dissolved silica removal flux due to biological uptake and fpro is the dissolved silica production flux due to the dissolution of reactive particulate si to dissolved silica maavara et al 2018 table s2 lists the values of each term used in the si mass balance we neglected surface water inflow qin because there was no significant surface inflow the groundwater derived dissolved silica flux qgwsigw was calculated by multiplying the groundwater inflow rate estimated from the 222rn mass balance by the dissolved silica concentration in the porewater using eq 7 the groundwater derived dissolved silica fluxes were estimated to be 4 3 1 2 106 3 0 0 5 107 and 9 6 1 5 106 mg day 1 for april september and february respectively the uncertainties of the groundwater derived dissolved silica flux mainly derived from the uncertainty of the estimated groundwater inflow rates importantly the dissolved silica flux associated with the groundwater inflow accounted for 60 september 2018 of the total dissolved silica input flux suggesting that groundwater derived dissolved silica is the important source of dissolved silica in the wetland water the fnet values were estimated to be 2 3 4 5 and 2 7 107 mg day 1 for april september and february respectively this suggests that the dissolved silica removal flux is relatively higher than the dissolved silica production rate in the wetland regardless of seasons although we could not quantify fpro and frem in this study as such the groundwater inflow rate estimated using 222rn as a groundwater tracer can be used to determine the behavior cycle and transport of other elements 5 conclusions we conducted hydrogeological investigations microbiological analyses and a 222rn mass balance to quantitatively and qualitatively assess groundwater inflow in a shallow wetland these techniques have limitations and strengths for their applications for example the 222rn mass balance can quantify the groundwater inflow rate despite large uncertainties and some assumptions all results from the various methods used in our study suggest that there is a distinguishable spatial difference in the groundwater inflow rate in the wetland our multidisciplinary approach can provide complementary information on the groundwater flow system in complex groundwater surface water mixing zones and groundwater dependent systems furthermore these approaches including the quantification of the groundwater inflow are useful for understanding and evaluating behaviors and mass exchanges of dissolved substances induced by groundwater surface water interactions in various aquatic systems credit authorship contribution statement

5106,drought is a major climate disturbance that can lower vegetation productivity and induce widespread vegetation die off which in turn can have a profound effect on the water cycle therefore quantification of vegetation specific responses to drought is essential to predict the impacts of climate change on ecosystem services we used two previously suggested quantitative metrics dynamic deviation d and elasticity e based on the budyko framework to evaluate site and watershed level hydrological resilience of different plant functional types pfts to drought by using data from 41 fluxnet sites and 2275 watersheds we found a global convergence in hydrological resilience to drought across a variety of pfts hydrological resilience of vegetation was related to drought intensity and water use efficiency a greater hydrological resilience was found in ptfs in drier areas than in wetter areas while this greater hydrological resilience was related to the coefficient of variation in precipitation we also found that pfts with a larger water use efficiency had higher hydrological resilience particularly in drier regions indicating adaptation strategies to changes in local climate conditions our findings can shed light on how ecosystems and watersheds dominated by different pfts will respond to future climatic change and inform water resources management keywords resilience drought ecosystems fluxnet watershed budyko method 1 introduction drought has a major impact on ecosystem functions and associated ecosystem services doughty et al 2015 han et al 2018 from local to global scales drought can significantly reduce vegetation productivity and induce widespread vegetation die off which in turn may alter the water cycle xiao et al 2009 kumagai et al 2012 choat et al 2012 allen et al 2015 yang et al 2017 wang et al 2019a 2019b the frequency and intensity of droughts have considerably increased in many places in recent decades dai 2011 and are expected to increase even more with concurrent hydrological changes followed by projected climate change dai 2013 zhou et al 2019 improving understanding of how ecosystems and watersheds respond to drought hydrologically is essential for informing climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies and water resources management quantifying a watershed or ecosystem s hydrological resilience to drought is essential for evaluating drought impacts on water yield wy i e terrestrial rainwater remaining the watershed after loss to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration or e hydrological resilience of a watershed can be predicted using the budyko theoretical framework budyko 1974 the budyko curve b describes the partitioning of precipitation p into e and wy by establishing a curvature relationship between the watershed s actual e normalized by p e p or the evaporative index ei and that of the potential e ep normalized by p ep p or the dryness index di this relationship however assumes steady state conditions in which the change in the watershed s water storage is negligible it is assumed that unmodified ecosystems are in such a steady state condition over a long period of one to a few years this assumption has been assessed with observed flux data from fluxnet sites worldwide williams et al 2012 however because a disrupted watershed or ecosystem may exhibit a deviation from steady state conditions such a deviation should be accounted for through the inherent deviation of the watershed or ecosystem static deviation s following creed et al 2014 and helman et al 2017a watersheds or ecosystems that are hydrologically resilient maintain or quickly regain hydrological function in the face of changing environmental conditions as predicted by the b curve creed et al 2014 most watersheds that are in a hydrological equilibrium state will behave as described by the b curve budyko 1974 though based on a theoretical background the budyko framework has been well validated with observations at both site 1km2 and watershed levels across the globe e g yang et al 2007 williams et al 2012 two budyko metrics are suggested to quantify hydrological resilience of an watershed dynamic deviation d the vertical displacement from b and elasticity e the displacement from b along both di and y ei axes within the budyko space fig 1 a ecosystem or watershed is considered elastic when its e is greater than 1 creed et al 2014 and the larger the e the more elastic the ecosystem watershed is according to creed et al 2014 a resilient watershed or ecosystem would have small d close to zero and large e meaning that the system is more adjustable to climatic change the readers are referred to helman et al 2017a for further explanation of elasticity although using the budyko framework may elucidate the factors affecting ecohydrological resilience the underlying mechanisms remain unclear since previous studies were limited in their geographical and climatic extent canada and israel therefore exploring the hydrological resilience at both ecosystem and watershed levels globally is essential for understanding ecohydrological responses to climate change we define a drought year as a year with less than normal precipitation distinguishing between normal and drought years and measured the severity of drought based on the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 the budyko metrics d and e were calculated based on normal and drought years using data obtained from 41 fluxnet sites and 2275 watersheds covering the main plant functional types pft and climatic regimes worldwide we selected those fluxnet sites having at least two consecutive years of drought and normal years and a lower e p than 1 5 to exclude water surplus in the systems only watersheds that the dominant pft covered at least 90 of the land cover were selected we ask the following question what are the main controlling factors of hydrological resilience of ecosystems and watersheds we hypothesize that hydrological resilience to drought is related to water use efficiency wue the ratio gross primary production to evapotranspiration we predict that ecosystems and watersheds will fall along the budyko curve under normal conditions with d close to zero and predictable wy but will vary in their deviation from the budyko curve under drought conditions specifically we predict that ecosystems and watersheds with low wue will show low hydrologic resilience to drought low e high d and unpredictable wy but systems with higher wue will have higher hydrologic resilience to drought high e low d and predictable wy 2 materials and methods budyko framework the budyko framework estimates wy by precipitation normalized potential evapotranspiration dry index di ep p and actual evapotranspiration evaporative index ei e p assuming a steady state condition budyko 1974 several analytical formulas with different parameterization schemes have been developed for the budyko framework with some small modifications to the originally proposed curve here we chose the modified budyko curve suggested by zhang et al 2001 with a water parameter ωz of 2 and 0 5 for forested and grassland cropland ecosystems respectively for consistency with creed et al 2014 and helman et al 2017a other plant functional types pft such as savanna and shrublands were given a ωz value of 1 following zhang et al 2001 the advantage of using the budyko curve modified by zhang et al 2001 lies in its adjustment to the ecosystem or watershed s pft composition which allows a more accurate partitioning of the precipitation into e and wy for the specific watershed the estimated long term e is thus derived through the use of the ecosystem or watershed s specific ωz as follows 1 e p 1 ω z e p p 1 ω z e p p e p p 1 using the budyko curve modified by zhang et al 2001 also allowed us to compare our results with those of creed et al 2014 and helman et al 2017a which used the same modified budyko framework to derive the dynamic deviation and elasticity metrics we thus calculated di and ei based on eq 1 using meteorological data for each watershed site see details below the two budyko metrics deviation and elasticity deviation s d is the vertical departure of ei from its corresponding theoretical value b as predicted by di according to the budyko curve creed et al 2014 deviation is composed of static s and dynamic deviation d static deviation is the inherent deviation of ei under average normal climate conditions ein and is calculated as the difference between ein and the corresponding b for a site fig 1 s ein bn dynamic deviation d is the deviation of ei from b under extreme climate conditions drought in our case eie and is calculated as the difference between eie and the corresponding b for a site after consideration of static deviation s d eie be s thus s stands for the inherent deviation of ei under average normal climate conditions and d stands for the additional deviation caused by drought a negative positive d indicates larger smaller wy than that expected by the budyko curve and a d close to zero indicates a hydrologically resilient site or watershed elasticity e is defined as the ratio of the interannual range of di to the interannual range of ei residual eir the magnitude of ei departing from its corresponding theoretical value b for a given year e dimax dimin eir max eir min the ei residual of a certain site or watershed is the difference between the actual ei and b value for each single year normal or drought which is different from s an averaged value under all normal years in most cases though not necessarily always a maximum ei residual is observed in years with the highest ei and vice versa a site with larger e indicates a smaller change in ei relative to the change in di x direction change dominated and thus close to the budyko curve and predictable wy i e more hydrologically resilient a site with smaller e indicates a larger change in ei relative to the change in di y direction change dominated and thus more deviated from the budyko curve and less predictable wy i e less hydrologically resilient fig 1 as in creed et al 2014 we used a threshold of one e 1 to define elastic or inelastic site or watershed data for site level analyses we used both site and watershed level water balances in the analysis because both scales had advantages for example while fluxnet sites provide more reliable meteorological and flux estimates than satellite based products they lack the necessary information on any potential lateral waterflow from nearby sources or groundwater discharge that are included in the discharge component measured at the watershed level moreover it was much easier to identify a homogenous site with a single pft than a homogenous watershed with a single pft although one can examine the effects of the dominant pft at the watershed level how other pfts affect the results remains unknown we used the newly released fluxnet2015 dataset https fluxnet fluxdata org to calculate d and e from eddy covariance derived e and ep a previous study showed that the budyko framework can be successfully applied at the site or ecosystem level using information from fluxnet sites williams et al 2012 the fluxnet2015 dataset contains information on carbon fluxes such as gross primary productivity gpp as well as meteorological precipitation p net radiation to derive ep rn temperature t and vapor pressure deficit vpd data needed for our analysis the data quality was assured by a standard data processing pipeline and new gap filling and partitioning methods https fluxnet fluxdata org the first observation year and the years with over 50 flux or meteorological data derived from gap filling were omitted in the following analysis since our objective was to examine the effect of drought on the hydrological resilience we selected sites with drought occurrence during the observation years of each site we used the global pdsi data zhao and running 2010 http files ntsg umt edu data to define meteorological drought for site selection and to define drought versus normal years for each selected site the global pdsi dataset has a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 50 km from 1973 to 2013 and the pdsi value was derived for all site years since the starting year of each site a site year with a pdsi value below above 1 was defined as a drought normal year it should be noted that by applying a threshold psdi value for normal years extreme wet years with a pdsi value much above the threshold were also included as normal years in the analysis this might affect the magnitude of d and e in such years however since it would be highly difficult to identify consecutive normal years with the extreme wet years excluded and the number of site years with such extreme wet conditions was less than 10 of the total number of site years we treated these years as normal years and included them in the analysis extra water supply may exist particularly at sites dominated by croplands cro therefore a supply limit of e p 1 5 was adopted in all 41 fluxnet sites following williams et al 2012 to ensure that surplus water was relatively small both rainfed and irrigated cro sites were considered in the analysis because we found that there was relatively small difference in ei and di between these ecosystems for example rainfed cro sites showed similar ei di relationships as irrigated cro sites for some sites we did not know whether they were irrigated or rainfed their relationship was also the same fig s1a also at the watershed level we found a good relationship between e and p in cro indicating a rather small negligible irrigation contribution to the water balance fig s1b finally the water use efficiency wue of the ecosystem i e the amount of carbon taken per determined amount of water lost via e was calculated following beer et al 2009 which includes vpd in its calculation as wue gpp vpd e for each of the 41 fluxnet sites that we identified wue was calculated for each year at the annual scale data for watershed level analyses watershed boundaries were delineated using the 30 arc second digital elevation model of the world provided by the u s geological survey hydro1k https www usgs gov overall more than 65 000 watersheds are provided through hydro1k as vector layers we selected watersheds with areas ranging from 1000 km2 to 10 000 km2 to ensure that the drought occurred over the entire watershed area the global 500 m annual moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover product mcd12q1 friedl et al 2010 was used to classify watersheds by their dominant pfts because the intention was to compare the hydrological resilience of different pfts dominated watersheds any watershed having at least 90 of the land area covered by the dominant pft was included in our analysis e and ep were calculated using the modis evapotranspiration product mod16a2 mu et al 2011 http www ntsg umt edu for consistency with e and ep the global gpp data were derived from another modis product mod17a2 which uses the same input meteorological data as mod16a2 to generate gpp estimates at the same spatial resolution zhao and running 2010 the mod16a2 and mod17a2 products are global composites with a spatial resolution of 1 km and are available since 2000 other meteorological data including p t and rn were obtained from the global land data assimilation system with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 25 km rodell et al 2004 specifically averaged annual values from 2000 to 2013 for e ep gpp radiation vpd temperature and precipitation were calculated for each watershed similar to the site level analysis we selected watersheds with at least two years of drought or normal conditions during the period 2000 2013 watersheds had to have at least one single dominant pft in its area wue was calculated simultaneously using the method from beer et al 2009 i e wue gpp vpd e a total of 2275 watersheds dominated by 10 pfts were retained for the following analyses fig 2 numerous factors may affect the ei di relationship of a watershed and thus result in a deviation from the budyko curve besides e ep and p the factors also include changes in vegetation cover phenology changes helman 2018 and human interference related changes e g agricultural management forest clearing as already mentioned we considered all these specific deviations by accounting for the inherent deviation of the watershed through the static deviation metric which was computed from data in both normal and dry years moreover because the water balance was calculated from discharge measured at the exit of the watershed it included any recharge coming from nearby sources such as rivers and groundwater discharges at the annual scale groundwater discharge was assumed to achieve steady state conditions such that the watershed outflow discharge measured at the watershed already included lateral contributions see e g ott et al 2019 3 results the sites and watersheds used this study generally fell along the budyko curve but some did not fig 3 shows the 41 sites and 2275 watersheds within the budyko space for the average of normal years before the climatic change most sites watersheds were energy limited ep p 1 and generally fell along b indicating steady state conditions however there were also some exceptions showing substantial static deviation large static deviations were particularly found for watersheds dominated by open shrublands osh croplands cro and grasslands gra likely due to the reduced e in periods when the vegetation was absent cro or dormant osh gra or due to underestimated e in high latitudes osh a negative static deviation ei below b may also indicate deviation from steady state conditions even at a relatively long period such as the 5 year average used here yet because both metrics the dynamic deviation and elasticity consider the inherent static deviation s of the sites watersheds these metrics are not affected by the violation of the assumption of steady state conditions changes in water storage along periods of several years are likely to happen in disrupted systems like croplands for example in which human interference through management e g irrigation is more likely there was a global convergence of ecosystems and watersheds in terms of ecosystems watersheds remaining close to the budyko curve during drought years but there were also regional divergences at the site level d varied between 0 79 and 0 70 d 0 06 0 27 table s1 sites with the smallest d i e very close to the budyko theoretical predictions d 0 05 included ecosystems covering a broad range of pfts fig 4 a however most sites 66 n 27 showed smaller wy larger d than expected from b in response to drought fig s2 table s1 the sites with the largest d were located in boreal areas with the maximum d value for an evergreen needleleaf forest enf site in saskatchewan canada ca sf2 and the minimum d value for a mixed forest mxf site of sylvania wilderness in michigan usa us syv at the watershed level the range of d was narrower with d varying from 0 37 to 0 59 d 0 004 0 058 for the 2275 watersheds table s2 covering a broad range of pfts fig 4b most watersheds 72 n 1643 had d

greater elasticity at the watershed level compared to the site level fig 5b both sites and watersheds showed regional divergence fig 5 for example some watersheds showed regional divergence from the e

mainly located in the mid and high latitudes of north america far east pan tropics and the dry areas of central eurasia dynamic deviation and elasticity were both determined by both abiotic and biotic factors dynamic deviation increased with drought severity d was negatively correlated with changes in p δp r 0 43 p 0 05 and r 0 42 p 0 001 for site and watershed levels respectively fig 6 a b and d was positively correlated with changes in e δe r 0 74 p 0 001 and r 0 37 p 0 001 for site and watershed levels respectively fig 6c d however the increase in dynamic deviation with drought severity was moderated by the vegetation s wue specifically d decreased with increasing wue r 0 34 p 0 05 and r 0 23 p 0 001 for site and watershed levels respectively fig 6e f and e increased with increasing wue fig 7 r 0 55 p 0 001 and r 0 49 p 0 001 for site and watershed levels respectively indicating greater hydrological resilience with increasing wue under drought conditions contrasting elasticity in wet and dry areas the elasticity of the watersheds was further analyzed with respect to their location in terms of ambient moisture conditions we used the koppen geiger climatic regions to classify all watersheds as relatively dry or wet which resulted in 366 of the watersheds classified as dry i e bwh bwk bsh bsk and 1909 as wet a significant difference in e was found between dry and wet watersheds with an average e of 29 02 34 94 and 5 49 3 92 p 0 001 in a two tailed t test respectively fig 8 a our further analysis indicates that e increased exponentially with the coefficient of variation in p cvp in dry watersheds fig 8b e 5 01 exp 7 18 cvp r 0 72 p 0 001 and this close relationship did not change for individual pdf dominated watersheds fig s4 in contrast cvp was not closely related with e for wet watersheds fig s5 4 discussion hydrological resilience to drought varied with plant functional type the smaller d median d close to zero observed in evergreen needleleaf forests enf and deciduous broadleaf forests dbf compared to grasslands gra positive d and savannas wsa and sav both with negative d were consistent with ecosystem observations of generally isohydric and anisohydric behavior of these systems respectively li et al 2017 among the forests watersheds dominated by deciduous forests dnf dbf and mxf had larger dynamic deviation compared to other pft dominated watersheds deciduous trees usually generate more water yield than evergreen trees swank and douglass 1974 by shedding their leaves when conditions are unfavorable e g cold and water shortage this should result in a lower e p ratio and therefore a lower dynamic deviation below the budyko curve for deciduous dominated forests dnf dbf and mxf than for evergreen forests enf and ebf however the opposite was observed with higher dynamic deviation of dnf dbf and mxf compared to enf or ebf fig 4 dnf mainly located in siberia showed particularly larger dynamic deviation in response to drought these forests are primarily composed of larches larix cajanderi whose transpiration is reported to be highly sensitive to climatic variations and warming xue et al 2012 iijima et al 2014 this may be caused by the anisohydric behavior of these forests to sustain carbon assimilation within the short growing season even when encountering stressful growing conditions xue et al 2015a 2015b though low these forests still had elasticity more than 1 which is the lower limit imposed by creed et al 2014 for hydrologically resilient watersheds perhaps reflecting the ability of these forests to maintain carbon assimilation and to adapt via changes in species composition kotani et al 2019 similarly woody savannas wsa mainly located in african tropics were less hydrologically resilient to drought likely due to higher sensitivity to inter annual seasonal precipitation sankaran et al 2005 it should be noted that because of the timescale that we used i e annual our analysis covered the dormant period of the vegetation that may differ among pfts this could impose some challenges for the interpretation of water balance results and the budyko metrics used in this study for example pfts with a prolonged dormant period would have lower e and consequently its change in d and e would depend on the timing of drought here we assumed that drought would affect these metrics at the annual scale through for example leaf development and other physiological adjustments barbeta et al 2015 osem o hara 2016 tatarinov et al 2016 the use of the budyko framework for seasonal water balance analyses e g chen et al 2013 du et al 2016 need to accurately estimate all water balance components such an analysis is infeasible for the spatial scale presented in our study we found a close relationship between the dynamic deviation and the elasticity of watersheds for watersheds having either negative larger than expected wy following drought or positive smaller than expected wy following drought dynamic deviations elasticity always increased when dynamic deviation approached a value of zero this implies that dynamic deviation and elasticity to drought were coupled for most watersheds this coupling suggests that vegetation dominated watersheds had a large potential to adapt to climate change and thus may be less vulnerable to drought on the other hand certain hot spot regions showed a decoupling of the d e relationship in response to drought with large dynamic deviation and small elasticity suggesting that these regions were vulnerable to drought fig 5 and fig s3 for example our results indicate that the pan tropics were sensitive and may be vulnerable to drought despite the relatively moist climate a possible explanation would be that the ecosystems in the tropics have long been acclimated to the moist climate and are not able to adapt to changes in water availability and therefore a subtle perturbation such as a sudden drought may induce a large change in ecosystem structure and or function doughty et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2013 the reduction of productivity or embolism caused by droughts have been widely observed across the tropics and projected to amplify under climate change which may put these forests at risk in the future kumagai et al 2012 similarly many observational and modeling results showed that drought can impact forests located in high latitude regions peng et al 2011 walker et al 2015 even though global warming may enhance the productivity or lengthen the growing season in these areas high latitude ecosystems may not necessarily benefit from such change due to accompanying permafrost degeneration and or decreased snowpack iijima et al 2014 lader et al 2019 previous studies have also shown that indirect effects of climate change such as more frequent fire and or insect outbreaks may become a threat for forests located at high latitudes xiao and zhuang 2007 anderegg et al 2015 hydrological response to drought was correlated with water use efficiency wue this indicates the important role of the vegetation in the hydrological balance of the watershed in essence wue is a physiological indicator that describes the tradeoff between the plant s water loss and its carbon gain beer et al 2009 xue et al 2015a 2015b both experimental and field observations as well as modeling studies reported wue changes driven by atmospheric co2 fertilization for example co2 fertilization has been suggested to contribute to high wue through partial closure of the plant stomata which maintains the ambient intercellular co2 concentration ratio constant in the leaf drake et al 1997 medlyn et al 2001 ainsworth and rogers 2007 keenan et al 2013 however the hypothesis that rising wue was primarily caused by widespread co2 induced reduction in stomatal conductance was challenged by a more recent study based on tree ring records of carbon and oxygen isotope measurements and basal area increments guerrieri et al 2019 guerrieri et al 2019 showed that widespread enhancement in photosynthesis made a larger contribution to rising wue compared to reduction in stomatal conductance the impact of wue and wue changes on the hydrological resilience of an ecosystem likely reflects the vegetation water use strategy trying to cope with drought especially in the water limited areas helman et al 2017a 2017b physiologically higher wue is a result of economic water use and optimum gas exchange rate adapted by the plant under conditions of water scarcity and or extreme heat collatz et al 1991 drake et al 1997 katul et al 2009 this means that future increases in atmospheric co2 concentrations and thus subsequent changes in wue will likely result in profound impacts on the water and carbon balances globally betts et al 2007 fatichi et al 2016 the higher hydrological resilience of dry versus wet watersheds suggests that vegetation in dry areas is adapted to drought this finding is in accordance with previously reported studies helman et al 2017a vegetation in dry regions may acclimate to local conditions by stomata regulation attia et al 2015 mcdowell et al 2008 this isohydric adaptation help plants to avoid hydraulic failure cavitation as well as potential mortality during harsh conditions mcdowell et al 2008 rowland et al 2015 klein et al 2013 argued that ecophysiological adjustments such as changes in wue to regulate stomata may be the strategy used by mediterranean forests to cope with climate change induced droughts they found for example a substantial increase in wue with drying also phenological changes such as altering the growing season length can be a key contributor to forest growth in arid and semi arid areas klein et al 2013 klein 2020 but a recent study showed no trends in spring and autumn phenology in the northern hemisphere during the global warming hiatus wang et al 2019a 2019b watershed elasticity increased exponentially with interannual variation of precipitation precipitation has been recognized as a key factor in determining vegetation distribution and productivity particularly in arid and semi arid regions liu et al 2018 ciemer et al 2019 for example the transition from forests to savanna was mainly determined by the interannual variation in precipitation gradients a higher interannual variation in precipitation may increase hydrological resilience through selection of vegetation adaptive traits to water stress ciemer et al 2019 large variations in precipitation have been shown to drive physiological adaptations such as increases in wue change in species composition and evolution of hydraulic transport in plants anderegg et al 2018 diversity in hydraulic transport may also increase hydrological resilience to drought through changes in a plant s water transport strategies such that it inhibits transpiration under drought conditions anderegg et al 2018 on the other hand vegetation may change carbon allocation strategies to cope with water deficit such as investing carbon to producing more roots than leaves which will increase transpiration doughty et al 2015 eziz et al 2017 uncertainties and limitations of the results the presented results regarding the hydrological resilience of ecosystems and watersheds to drought are derived by a simple budyko method though this method was proved to be valid for watershed and site level analysis e g williams et al 2012 helman et al 2017a it is highly dependent on the assumption of a steady state condition in the hydrological system i e water storage does not change over a period of one or more years however this is not always the case as shown in fig 2b and previous studies e g williams et al 2012 extra water supply may particularly occur at the site level and in agricultural systems our analysis did not consider water storage changes because of the difficulty to obtain such data particularly at the watershed level this may partly contribute to the higher d and e values in some ecosystems or watersheds one way to overcome the problem of violating the steady state assumption is to account for the inherent deviation of ei di from the budyko curve here we used the static deviation metric as a measure to such inherent deviation following creed et al 2015 and helman et al 2017a although the static deviation could resolve the inherent constant deviation this did not account for between year changes in water storage a rather generally strict site screening procedure was further conducted to further mitigate this issue the screening was applied by selecting only those sites with the e p ratio smaller than 1 5 which could ensure that surplus water was minimal the similar linear relationship between ei and di in rainfed and irrigated cro sites fig s1a and the significant linear correlation between e and p among cro watersheds r2 0 66 p 0 001 fig s1b indicate that the lateral inflow was at a minimum and thereby the steady state assumption was reasonable to some extent further research should focus on potential deviations from the steady state condition and its implications for the suggested budyko method 5 conclusions in this study we used two quantitative metrics proposed by creed et al 2014 and helman et al 2017a based on a budyko framework dynamic deviation d and elasticity e to evaluate the site and watershed level hydrological resilience to drought using fluxnet and remote sensing data we found a global convergence in hydrological resilience to meteorological drought represented by the budyko metrics covering various pfts the hydrological resilience was related to abiotic and biotic factors and was positively related to the vegetation water use efficiency a greater hydrological resilience was found in drier areas than in wetter areas which was mainly related to the distribution of precipitation throughout the year as measured by the coefficient of variation in precipitation to our knowledge this is the first study that uses the budyko framework to examine the resistance and resilience of main pfts to drought at the global scale the previous studies by creed et al 2015 and helman et al 2017a showed the great potential of the two budyko metrics to explore the impacts of climatic change e g warming rainfall reduction on forest ecosystems here for the first time we explored drought impacts hydrological resilience on the global scale using data from both sites and watersheds our findings revealed important processes relating the resilience of numerous ecosystems and watersheds to various abiotic and biotic factors the responses that we found for different ecosystems and watersheds are particularly important in dry and cold areas such as the tibetan plateau also known as asia s water tower changes in water yield for example may affect water availability and river discharge both essential for life and social development in these and many other areas afforestation is taking place in numerous places around the globe as a measure to combat desertification and mitigate climate change but afforestation efforts may reduce available water resources it was found for example that oak dominated forests ebf consume more water than pine dominated forests enf helman et al 2017b helman 2018 rohatyn et al 2018 it is therefore important to properly plan which trees will be planted and how afforestation will affect water resources our findings can shed light on how ecosystems and watersheds dominated by different pfts will respond to future climatic change and inform afforestation

5106,drought is a major climate disturbance that can lower vegetation productivity and induce widespread vegetation die off which in turn can have a profound effect on the water cycle therefore quantification of vegetation specific responses to drought is essential to predict the impacts of climate change on ecosystem services we used two previously suggested quantitative metrics dynamic deviation d and elasticity e based on the budyko framework to evaluate site and watershed level hydrological resilience of different plant functional types pfts to drought by using data from 41 fluxnet sites and 2275 watersheds we found a global convergence in hydrological resilience to drought across a variety of pfts hydrological resilience of vegetation was related to drought intensity and water use efficiency a greater hydrological resilience was found in ptfs in drier areas than in wetter areas while this greater hydrological resilience was related to the coefficient of variation in precipitation we also found that pfts with a larger water use efficiency had higher hydrological resilience particularly in drier regions indicating adaptation strategies to changes in local climate conditions our findings can shed light on how ecosystems and watersheds dominated by different pfts will respond to future climatic change and inform water resources management keywords resilience drought ecosystems fluxnet watershed budyko method 1 introduction drought has a major impact on ecosystem functions and associated ecosystem services doughty et al 2015 han et al 2018 from local to global scales drought can significantly reduce vegetation productivity and induce widespread vegetation die off which in turn may alter the water cycle xiao et al 2009 kumagai et al 2012 choat et al 2012 allen et al 2015 yang et al 2017 wang et al 2019a 2019b the frequency and intensity of droughts have considerably increased in many places in recent decades dai 2011 and are expected to increase even more with concurrent hydrological changes followed by projected climate change dai 2013 zhou et al 2019 improving understanding of how ecosystems and watersheds respond to drought hydrologically is essential for informing climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies and water resources management quantifying a watershed or ecosystem s hydrological resilience to drought is essential for evaluating drought impacts on water yield wy i e terrestrial rainwater remaining the watershed after loss to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration or e hydrological resilience of a watershed can be predicted using the budyko theoretical framework budyko 1974 the budyko curve b describes the partitioning of precipitation p into e and wy by establishing a curvature relationship between the watershed s actual e normalized by p e p or the evaporative index ei and that of the potential e ep normalized by p ep p or the dryness index di this relationship however assumes steady state conditions in which the change in the watershed s water storage is negligible it is assumed that unmodified ecosystems are in such a steady state condition over a long period of one to a few years this assumption has been assessed with observed flux data from fluxnet sites worldwide williams et al 2012 however because a disrupted watershed or ecosystem may exhibit a deviation from steady state conditions such a deviation should be accounted for through the inherent deviation of the watershed or ecosystem static deviation s following creed et al 2014 and helman et al 2017a watersheds or ecosystems that are hydrologically resilient maintain or quickly regain hydrological function in the face of changing environmental conditions as predicted by the b curve creed et al 2014 most watersheds that are in a hydrological equilibrium state will behave as described by the b curve budyko 1974 though based on a theoretical background the budyko framework has been well validated with observations at both site 1km2 and watershed levels across the globe e g yang et al 2007 williams et al 2012 two budyko metrics are suggested to quantify hydrological resilience of an watershed dynamic deviation d the vertical displacement from b and elasticity e the displacement from b along both di and y ei axes within the budyko space fig 1 a ecosystem or watershed is considered elastic when its e is greater than 1 creed et al 2014 and the larger the e the more elastic the ecosystem watershed is according to creed et al 2014 a resilient watershed or ecosystem would have small d close to zero and large e meaning that the system is more adjustable to climatic change the readers are referred to helman et al 2017a for further explanation of elasticity although using the budyko framework may elucidate the factors affecting ecohydrological resilience the underlying mechanisms remain unclear since previous studies were limited in their geographical and climatic extent canada and israel therefore exploring the hydrological resilience at both ecosystem and watershed levels globally is essential for understanding ecohydrological responses to climate change we define a drought year as a year with less than normal precipitation distinguishing between normal and drought years and measured the severity of drought based on the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 the budyko metrics d and e were calculated based on normal and drought years using data obtained from 41 fluxnet sites and 2275 watersheds covering the main plant functional types pft and climatic regimes worldwide we selected those fluxnet sites having at least two consecutive years of drought and normal years and a lower e p than 1 5 to exclude water surplus in the systems only watersheds that the dominant pft covered at least 90 of the land cover were selected we ask the following question what are the main controlling factors of hydrological resilience of ecosystems and watersheds we hypothesize that hydrological resilience to drought is related to water use efficiency wue the ratio gross primary production to evapotranspiration we predict that ecosystems and watersheds will fall along the budyko curve under normal conditions with d close to zero and predictable wy but will vary in their deviation from the budyko curve under drought conditions specifically we predict that ecosystems and watersheds with low wue will show low hydrologic resilience to drought low e high d and unpredictable wy but systems with higher wue will have higher hydrologic resilience to drought high e low d and predictable wy 2 materials and methods budyko framework the budyko framework estimates wy by precipitation normalized potential evapotranspiration dry index di ep p and actual evapotranspiration evaporative index ei e p assuming a steady state condition budyko 1974 several analytical formulas with different parameterization schemes have been developed for the budyko framework with some small modifications to the originally proposed curve here we chose the modified budyko curve suggested by zhang et al 2001 with a water parameter ωz of 2 and 0 5 for forested and grassland cropland ecosystems respectively for consistency with creed et al 2014 and helman et al 2017a other plant functional types pft such as savanna and shrublands were given a ωz value of 1 following zhang et al 2001 the advantage of using the budyko curve modified by zhang et al 2001 lies in its adjustment to the ecosystem or watershed s pft composition which allows a more accurate partitioning of the precipitation into e and wy for the specific watershed the estimated long term e is thus derived through the use of the ecosystem or watershed s specific ωz as follows 1 e p 1 ω z e p p 1 ω z e p p e p p 1 using the budyko curve modified by zhang et al 2001 also allowed us to compare our results with those of creed et al 2014 and helman et al 2017a which used the same modified budyko framework to derive the dynamic deviation and elasticity metrics we thus calculated di and ei based on eq 1 using meteorological data for each watershed site see details below the two budyko metrics deviation and elasticity deviation s d is the vertical departure of ei from its corresponding theoretical value b as predicted by di according to the budyko curve creed et al 2014 deviation is composed of static s and dynamic deviation d static deviation is the inherent deviation of ei under average normal climate conditions ein and is calculated as the difference between ein and the corresponding b for a site fig 1 s ein bn dynamic deviation d is the deviation of ei from b under extreme climate conditions drought in our case eie and is calculated as the difference between eie and the corresponding b for a site after consideration of static deviation s d eie be s thus s stands for the inherent deviation of ei under average normal climate conditions and d stands for the additional deviation caused by drought a negative positive d indicates larger smaller wy than that expected by the budyko curve and a d close to zero indicates a hydrologically resilient site or watershed elasticity e is defined as the ratio of the interannual range of di to the interannual range of ei residual eir the magnitude of ei departing from its corresponding theoretical value b for a given year e dimax dimin eir max eir min the ei residual of a certain site or watershed is the difference between the actual ei and b value for each single year normal or drought which is different from s an averaged value under all normal years in most cases though not necessarily always a maximum ei residual is observed in years with the highest ei and vice versa a site with larger e indicates a smaller change in ei relative to the change in di x direction change dominated and thus close to the budyko curve and predictable wy i e more hydrologically resilient a site with smaller e indicates a larger change in ei relative to the change in di y direction change dominated and thus more deviated from the budyko curve and less predictable wy i e less hydrologically resilient fig 1 as in creed et al 2014 we used a threshold of one e 1 to define elastic or inelastic site or watershed data for site level analyses we used both site and watershed level water balances in the analysis because both scales had advantages for example while fluxnet sites provide more reliable meteorological and flux estimates than satellite based products they lack the necessary information on any potential lateral waterflow from nearby sources or groundwater discharge that are included in the discharge component measured at the watershed level moreover it was much easier to identify a homogenous site with a single pft than a homogenous watershed with a single pft although one can examine the effects of the dominant pft at the watershed level how other pfts affect the results remains unknown we used the newly released fluxnet2015 dataset https fluxnet fluxdata org to calculate d and e from eddy covariance derived e and ep a previous study showed that the budyko framework can be successfully applied at the site or ecosystem level using information from fluxnet sites williams et al 2012 the fluxnet2015 dataset contains information on carbon fluxes such as gross primary productivity gpp as well as meteorological precipitation p net radiation to derive ep rn temperature t and vapor pressure deficit vpd data needed for our analysis the data quality was assured by a standard data processing pipeline and new gap filling and partitioning methods https fluxnet fluxdata org the first observation year and the years with over 50 flux or meteorological data derived from gap filling were omitted in the following analysis since our objective was to examine the effect of drought on the hydrological resilience we selected sites with drought occurrence during the observation years of each site we used the global pdsi data zhao and running 2010 http files ntsg umt edu data to define meteorological drought for site selection and to define drought versus normal years for each selected site the global pdsi dataset has a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 50 km from 1973 to 2013 and the pdsi value was derived for all site years since the starting year of each site a site year with a pdsi value below above 1 was defined as a drought normal year it should be noted that by applying a threshold psdi value for normal years extreme wet years with a pdsi value much above the threshold were also included as normal years in the analysis this might affect the magnitude of d and e in such years however since it would be highly difficult to identify consecutive normal years with the extreme wet years excluded and the number of site years with such extreme wet conditions was less than 10 of the total number of site years we treated these years as normal years and included them in the analysis extra water supply may exist particularly at sites dominated by croplands cro therefore a supply limit of e p 1 5 was adopted in all 41 fluxnet sites following williams et al 2012 to ensure that surplus water was relatively small both rainfed and irrigated cro sites were considered in the analysis because we found that there was relatively small difference in ei and di between these ecosystems for example rainfed cro sites showed similar ei di relationships as irrigated cro sites for some sites we did not know whether they were irrigated or rainfed their relationship was also the same fig s1a also at the watershed level we found a good relationship between e and p in cro indicating a rather small negligible irrigation contribution to the water balance fig s1b finally the water use efficiency wue of the ecosystem i e the amount of carbon taken per determined amount of water lost via e was calculated following beer et al 2009 which includes vpd in its calculation as wue gpp vpd e for each of the 41 fluxnet sites that we identified wue was calculated for each year at the annual scale data for watershed level analyses watershed boundaries were delineated using the 30 arc second digital elevation model of the world provided by the u s geological survey hydro1k https www usgs gov overall more than 65 000 watersheds are provided through hydro1k as vector layers we selected watersheds with areas ranging from 1000 km2 to 10 000 km2 to ensure that the drought occurred over the entire watershed area the global 500 m annual moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover product mcd12q1 friedl et al 2010 was used to classify watersheds by their dominant pfts because the intention was to compare the hydrological resilience of different pfts dominated watersheds any watershed having at least 90 of the land area covered by the dominant pft was included in our analysis e and ep were calculated using the modis evapotranspiration product mod16a2 mu et al 2011 http www ntsg umt edu for consistency with e and ep the global gpp data were derived from another modis product mod17a2 which uses the same input meteorological data as mod16a2 to generate gpp estimates at the same spatial resolution zhao and running 2010 the mod16a2 and mod17a2 products are global composites with a spatial resolution of 1 km and are available since 2000 other meteorological data including p t and rn were obtained from the global land data assimilation system with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 25 km rodell et al 2004 specifically averaged annual values from 2000 to 2013 for e ep gpp radiation vpd temperature and precipitation were calculated for each watershed similar to the site level analysis we selected watersheds with at least two years of drought or normal conditions during the period 2000 2013 watersheds had to have at least one single dominant pft in its area wue was calculated simultaneously using the method from beer et al 2009 i e wue gpp vpd e a total of 2275 watersheds dominated by 10 pfts were retained for the following analyses fig 2 numerous factors may affect the ei di relationship of a watershed and thus result in a deviation from the budyko curve besides e ep and p the factors also include changes in vegetation cover phenology changes helman 2018 and human interference related changes e g agricultural management forest clearing as already mentioned we considered all these specific deviations by accounting for the inherent deviation of the watershed through the static deviation metric which was computed from data in both normal and dry years moreover because the water balance was calculated from discharge measured at the exit of the watershed it included any recharge coming from nearby sources such as rivers and groundwater discharges at the annual scale groundwater discharge was assumed to achieve steady state conditions such that the watershed outflow discharge measured at the watershed already included lateral contributions see e g ott et al 2019 3 results the sites and watersheds used this study generally fell along the budyko curve but some did not fig 3 shows the 41 sites and 2275 watersheds within the budyko space for the average of normal years before the climatic change most sites watersheds were energy limited ep p 1 and generally fell along b indicating steady state conditions however there were also some exceptions showing substantial static deviation large static deviations were particularly found for watersheds dominated by open shrublands osh croplands cro and grasslands gra likely due to the reduced e in periods when the vegetation was absent cro or dormant osh gra or due to underestimated e in high latitudes osh a negative static deviation ei below b may also indicate deviation from steady state conditions even at a relatively long period such as the 5 year average used here yet because both metrics the dynamic deviation and elasticity consider the inherent static deviation s of the sites watersheds these metrics are not affected by the violation of the assumption of steady state conditions changes in water storage along periods of several years are likely to happen in disrupted systems like croplands for example in which human interference through management e g irrigation is more likely there was a global convergence of ecosystems and watersheds in terms of ecosystems watersheds remaining close to the budyko curve during drought years but there were also regional

broad range of pfts fig 4 a however most sites 66 n 27 showed smaller wy larger d than expected from b in response to drought fig s2 table s1 the sites with the largest d were located in boreal areas with the maximum d value for an evergreen needleleaf forest enf site in saskatchewan canada ca sf2 and the minimum d value for a mixed forest mxf site of sylvania wilderness in michigan usa us syv at

greater elasticity at the watershed level compared to the site level fig 5b both sites and watersheds showed regional divergence fig 5 for example some watersheds showed regional divergence from the e

mainly located in the mid and high latitudes of north america far east pan tropics and the dry areas of central eurasia dynamic deviation and elasticity were both determined by both abiotic and biotic factors dynamic deviation increased with drought severity d was negatively correlated with changes in p δp r 0 43 p 0 05 and r 0 42 p 0 001 for site and watershed levels respectively fig 6 a b and d was positively correlated with changes in e δe r 0 74 p 0 001 and r 0 37 p 0 001 for site and watershed levels respectively fig 6c d however the increase in dynamic deviation with drought severity was moderated by the vegetation s wue specifically d decreased with increasing wue r 0 34 p 0 05 and r 0 23 p 0 001 for site and watershed levels respectively fig 6e f and e increased with increasing wue fig 7 r 0 55 p 0 001 and r 0 49 p 0 001 for site and watershed levels respectively indicating greater hydrological resilience with increasing wue under drought conditions contrasting elasticity in wet and dry areas the elasticity of the watersheds was further analyzed with respect to their location in terms of ambient moisture conditions we used the koppen geiger climatic regions to classify all watersheds as relatively dry or wet which resulted in 366 of the watersheds classified as dry i e bwh bwk bsh bsk and 1909 as wet a significant difference in e was found between dry and wet watersheds with an average e of 29 02 34 94 and 5 49 3 92 p 0 001 in a two tailed t test respectively fig 8 a our further analysis indicates that e increased exponentially with the coefficient of variation in p cvp in dry watersheds fig 8b e 5 01 exp 7 18 cvp r 0 72 p 0 001 and this close relationship did not change for individual pdf dominated watersheds fig s4 in contrast cvp was not closely related with e for wet watersheds fig s5 4 discussion hydrological resilience to drought varied with plant functional type the smaller d median d close to zero observed in evergreen needleleaf forests enf and deciduous broadleaf forests dbf compared to grasslands gra positive d and savannas wsa and sav both with negative d were consistent with ecosystem observations of generally isohydric and anisohydric behavior of these systems respectively li et al 2017 among the forests watersheds dominated by deciduous forests dnf dbf and mxf had larger dynamic deviation compared to other pft dominated watersheds deciduous trees usually generate more water yield than evergreen trees swank and douglass 1974 by shedding their leaves when conditions are unfavorable e g cold and water shortage this should result in a lower e p ratio and therefore a lower dynamic deviation below the budyko curve for deciduous dominated forests dnf dbf and mxf than for evergreen forests enf and ebf however the opposite was observed with higher dynamic deviation of dnf dbf and mxf compared to enf or ebf fig 4 dnf mainly located in siberia showed particularly larger dynamic deviation in response to drought these forests are primarily composed of larches larix cajanderi whose transpiration is reported to be highly sensitive to climatic variations and warming xue et al 2012 iijima et al 2014 this may be caused by the anisohydric behavior of these forests to sustain carbon assimilation within the short growing season even when encountering stressful growing conditions xue et al 2015a 2015b though low these forests still had elasticity more than 1 which is the lower limit imposed by creed et al 2014 for hydrologically resilient watersheds perhaps reflecting the ability of these forests to maintain carbon assimilation and to adapt via changes in species composition kotani et al 2019 similarly woody savannas wsa mainly located in african tropics were less hydrologically resilient to drought likely due to higher sensitivity to inter annual seasonal precipitation sankaran et al 2005 it should be noted that because of the timescale that we used i e annual our analysis covered the dormant period of the vegetation that may differ among pfts this could impose some challenges for the interpretation of water balance results and the budyko metrics used in this study for example pfts with a prolonged dormant period would have lower e and consequently its change in d and e would depend on the timing of drought here we assumed that drought would affect these metrics at the annual scale through for example leaf development and other physiological adjustments barbeta et al 2015 osem o hara 2016 tatarinov et al 2016 the use of the budyko framework for seasonal water balance analyses e g chen et al 2013 du et al 2016 need to accurately estimate all water balance components such an analysis is infeasible for the spatial scale presented in our study we found a close relationship between the dynamic deviation and the elasticity of watersheds for watersheds having either negative larger than expected wy following drought or positive smaller than expected wy following drought dynamic deviations elasticity always increased when dynamic deviation approached a value of zero this implies that dynamic deviation and elasticity to drought were coupled for most watersheds this coupling suggests that vegetation dominated watersheds had a large potential to adapt to climate change and thus may be less vulnerable to drought on the other hand certain hot spot regions showed a decoupling of the d e relationship in response to drought with large dynamic deviation and small elasticity suggesting that these regions were vulnerable to drought fig 5 and fig s3 for example our results indicate that the pan tropics were sensitive and may be vulnerable to drought despite the relatively moist climate a possible explanation would be that the ecosystems in the tropics have long been acclimated to the moist climate and are not able to adapt to changes in water availability and therefore a subtle perturbation such as a sudden drought may induce a large change in ecosystem structure and or function doughty et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2013 the reduction of productivity or embolism caused by droughts have been widely observed across the tropics and projected to amplify under climate change which may put these forests at risk in the future kumagai et al 2012 similarly many observational and modeling results showed that drought can impact forests located in high latitude regions peng et al 2011 walker et al 2015 even though global warming may enhance the productivity or lengthen the growing season in these areas high latitude ecosystems may not necessarily benefit from such change due to accompanying permafrost degeneration and or decreased snowpack iijima et al 2014 lader et al 2019 previous studies have also shown that indirect effects of climate change such as more frequent fire and or insect outbreaks may become a threat for forests located at high latitudes xiao and zhuang 2007 anderegg et al 2015 hydrological response to drought was correlated with water use efficiency wue this indicates the important role of the vegetation in the hydrological balance of the watershed in essence wue is a physiological indicator that describes the tradeoff between the plant s water loss and its carbon gain beer et al 2009 xue et al 2015a 2015b both experimental and field observations as well as modeling studies reported wue changes driven by atmospheric co2 fertilization for example co2 fertilization has been suggested to contribute to high wue through partial closure of the plant stomata which maintains the ambient intercellular co2 concentration ratio constant in the leaf drake et al 1997 medlyn et al 2001 ainsworth and rogers 2007 keenan et al 2013 however the hypothesis that rising wue was primarily caused by widespread co2 induced reduction in stomatal conductance was challenged by a more recent study based on tree ring records of carbon and oxygen isotope measurements and basal area increments guerrieri et al 2019 guerrieri et al 2019 showed that widespread enhancement in photosynthesis made a larger contribution to rising wue compared to reduction in stomatal conductance the impact of wue and wue changes on the hydrological resilience of an ecosystem likely reflects the vegetation water use strategy trying to cope with drought especially in the water limited areas helman et al 2017a 2017b physiologically higher wue is a result of economic water use and optimum gas exchange rate adapted by the plant under conditions of water scarcity and or extreme heat collatz et al 1991 drake et al 1997 katul et al 2009 this means that future increases in atmospheric co2 concentrations and thus subsequent changes in wue will likely result in profound impacts on the water and carbon balances globally betts et al 2007 fatichi et al 2016 the higher hydrological resilience of dry versus wet watersheds suggests that vegetation in dry areas is adapted to drought this finding is in accordance with previously reported studies helman et al 2017a vegetation in dry regions may acclimate to local conditions by stomata regulation attia et al 2015 mcdowell et al 2008 this isohydric adaptation help plants to avoid hydraulic failure cavitation as well as potential mortality during harsh conditions mcdowell et al 2008 rowland et al 2015 klein et al 2013 argued that ecophysiological adjustments such as changes in wue to regulate stomata may be the strategy used by mediterranean forests to cope with climate change induced droughts they found for example a substantial increase in wue with drying also phenological changes such as altering the growing season length can be a key contributor to forest growth in arid and semi arid areas klein et al 2013 klein 2020 but a recent study showed no trends in spring and autumn phenology in the northern hemisphere during the global warming hiatus wang et al 2019a 2019b watershed elasticity increased exponentially with interannual variation of precipitation precipitation has been recognized as a key factor in determining vegetation distribution and productivity particularly in arid and semi arid regions liu et al 2018 ciemer et al 2019 for example the transition from forests to savanna was mainly determined by the interannual variation in precipitation gradients a higher interannual variation in precipitation may increase hydrological resilience through selection of vegetation adaptive traits to water stress ciemer et al 2019 large variations in precipitation have been shown to drive physiological adaptations such as increases in wue change in species composition and evolution of hydraulic transport in plants anderegg et al 2018 diversity in hydraulic transport may also increase hydrological resilience to drought through changes in a plant s water transport strategies such that it inhibits transpiration under drought conditions anderegg et al 2018 on the other hand vegetation may change carbon allocation strategies to cope with water deficit such as investing carbon to producing more roots than leaves which will increase transpiration doughty et al 2015 eziz et al 2017 uncertainties and limitations of the results the presented results regarding the hydrological resilience of ecosystems and watersheds to drought are derived by a simple budyko method though this method was proved to be valid for watershed and site level analysis e g williams et al 2012 helman et al 2017a it is highly dependent on the assumption of a steady state condition in the hydrological system i e water storage does not change over a period of one or more years however this is not always the case as shown in fig 2b and previous studies e g williams et al 2012 extra water supply may particularly occur at the site level and in agricultural systems our analysis did not consider water storage changes because of the difficulty to obtain such data particularly at the watershed level this may partly contribute to the higher d and e values in some ecosystems or watersheds one way to overcome the problem of violating the steady state assumption is to account for the inherent deviation of ei di from the budyko curve here we used the static deviation metric as a measure to such inherent deviation following creed et al 2015 and helman et al 2017a although the static deviation could resolve the inherent constant deviation this did not account for between year changes in water storage a rather generally strict site screening procedure was further conducted to further mitigate this issue the screening was applied by selecting only those sites with the e p ratio smaller than 1 5 which could ensure that surplus water was minimal the similar linear relationship between ei and di in rainfed and irrigated cro sites fig s1a and the significant linear correlation between e and p among cro watersheds r2 0 66 p 0 001 fig s1b indicate that the lateral inflow was at a minimum and thereby the steady state assumption was reasonable to some extent further research should focus on potential deviations from the steady state condition and its implications for the suggested budyko method 5 conclusions in this study we used two quantitative metrics proposed by creed et al 2014 and helman et al 2017a based on a budyko framework dynamic deviation d and elasticity e to evaluate the site and watershed level hydrological resilience to drought using fluxnet and remote sensing data we found a global convergence in hydrological resilience to meteorological drought represented by the budyko metrics covering various pfts the hydrological resilience was related to abiotic and biotic factors and was positively related to the vegetation water use efficiency a greater hydrological resilience was found in drier areas than in wetter areas which was mainly related to the distribution of precipitation throughout the year as measured by the coefficient of variation in precipitation to our knowledge this is the first study that uses the budyko framework to examine the resistance and resilience of main pfts to drought at the global scale the previous studies by creed et al 2015 and helman et al 2017a showed the great potential of the two budyko metrics to explore the impacts of climatic change e g warming rainfall reduction on forest ecosystems here for the first time we explored drought impacts hydrological resilience on the global scale using data from both sites and watersheds our findings revealed important processes relating the resilience of numerous ecosystems and watersheds to various abiotic and biotic factors the responses that we found for different ecosystems and watersheds are particularly important in dry and cold areas such as the tibetan plateau also known as asia s water tower changes in water yield for example may affect water availability and river discharge both essential for life and social development in these and many other areas afforestation is taking place in numerous places around the globe as a measure to combat desertification and mitigate climate change but afforestation efforts may reduce available water resources it was found for example that oak dominated forests ebf consume more water than pine dominated forests enf helman et al 2017b helman 2018 rohatyn et al 2018 it is therefore important to properly plan which trees will be planted and how afforestation will affect water resources our findings can shed light on how ecosystems and watersheds dominated by different pfts will respond to future climatic change and inform afforestation

5107,in this study spatiotemporal variation of water pollution near a municipal solid waste dumpsite was investigated for this purpose the analyses of heavy metals and 23 physicochemical parameters were performed three surface water and six groundwater resources both in dry and wet seasons were monitored between september 2016 and august 2017 landfill water pollution index lwpi was calculated and the results were compared with those obtained from principal component analysis pca and self organizing map som the important objective of spatiotemporal pollution assessment of surface water and groundwater was to evaluate the performance of lwpi measure in determining polluted regions in comparison to linear i e pca and nonlinear i e som clustering methods the results indicated low water quality in both surface water and groundwater due to leachate penetration surface water and groundwater samples close to the dumpsite showed the most pollution impact according to lwpi where for samples with lwpi 1 are considered as polluted water due to landfill leachate in this study the polluted samples ranged from 1 to 42 5 with the mean value of 7 46 the seasonal assessment of pollution indicated that more severe leachate impact was observed during the wet season the clustering results indicated that both pca and som categorized surface water and groundwater samples into five clusters while lwpi classified them into three groups including unpolluted semi polluted and polluted regions in spite of different numbers of clusters the pca and som and lwpi results showed identical outcome about range of pollution in spatial analysis of water quality therefore application of lwpi with only ten parameters instead of pca and som clustering methods which were implemented based on several physicochemical parameters is suggested as the main practical implication of this study keywords groundwater landfill water pollution index lwpi landfill leachate principal component analysis pca surface water self organizing map som 1 introduction lack of fresh water resources is one of the main challenges in the recent century due to shortage of sufficient availablewater resources especially in arid and semi arid areas the protection of existing water resources has the prime importance municipal waste and landfilling is one of the main cause of water pollution around the world in spite of great improvements in municipal solid waste management actions including reduction recycling composting and incineration landfilling as a final step of solid waste management and disposal is still mandatory cheng et al 2011 landfills and dumpsites are potential water pollution sources due to leachate generation which migrates into the water bodies foufoua et al 2017 water pollution due to the leachate migration is considered as a serious environmental threat and is dependent on leachate age solid waste degradation rate composition and amount of the leachate landfill location distance from water bodies soil type climatic conditions and etc talalaj and biedka 2016 water pollution has been reported as a potential health problem and a good number of studies have developed various measures to properly monitor water quality liu and kuo 2003 gibrilla et al 2011 the use of such measures reduces the difficulties of processing numerous water quality indicators and can be helpful in diagnosing diverse sources of pollution some of these measures are mentioned as follows world health organization who standards for drinking water gibrilla et al 2011 horton s water quality index wqi as a rating to show the composite influence of different water quality parameters abbasi and abbasi 2012 brown s index as the modified wqi with much greater precision in selecting parameters brown et al 1970 multiplicative water quality index dinius 1987 and the oregon water quality index owqi cude 2007 although the latter index can help to assess the water quality management activities more effectively it should not be adopted for evaluation of water resources in a strongly polluted landfill area talalaj and biedka 2016 talalaj 2014 introduced a landfill water pollution index lwpi to evaluate water pollution due to landfill leachate lwpi provides a convenient and appropriate measure to recognize water pollution with landfill source which has been applied in the recent studies e g talalaj and biedka 2016 foufoua et al 2017 krčmar et al 2018 kapelewska et al 2019 beside the water quality assessment measures several cluster analyses and multivariate statistical techniques have been used over physicochemical data of water analysis to discern pollution source and major responsible factors in water pollution huang et al 2015 kim et al 2016 guo et al 2018 water quality parameters are usually inter correlated and the efficient assessment without data classification seems unreasonable in this way cluster analysis and multivariate statistical approaches allow the deriving of hidden information from physicochemical data so proper decisions on managing contaminated water resources would be possible several clustering methods such as hierarchical clustering rokach and maimon 2005 k means clustering kanungo et al 2002 principal component analysis pca abdi and williams 2010 multivariate normal distributions genz and bretz 2009 and unsupervised neural network called self organizing map som kohonen 1995 have been proposed for water quality data classification in this study two techniques i e pca and som of mentioned clustering methods were used to determine the possible influences of a landfill on water quality of a region the principal components pcs are the linear combination of observed data with maximum variations and minimum loss of the original information owing to the fact that selection of the pcs is provided based on linear variance covariance relation among data the pcs provide information for interpreting the most significant physicochemical parameters pca has been successfully applied to interpret water quality parameters in several studies e g jayakumar and siraz 1997 vermonden et al 2009 daou et al 2016 since there is not only linear relation between physicochemical parameters of water quality detecting the nonlinear relations can also be profitable in diagnosing the water quality of a region therefore the application of a nonlinear clustering method i e som to determine the relation between parameters can provide distinct aspect of clustering simeonova et al 2010 yang et al 2012 voyslavov et al 2012 nourani et al 2013 an et al 2016 wu et al 2016 li et al 2018 few studies have employed som to identify landfill effects on the surrounding water quality pearce et al 2011 bieroza et al 2009 he and fan 2016 in this regard pearce et al 2011 evaluated groundwater contamination by landfill leachate using microbial community profile data and a nonparametric decision making process they used som to weight the input variables which are obtained from pca based on their relative importance and provide statistical guidance for classifying the microbial data similarities he and fan 2016 investigated the effect of landfill leachates on the characteristics of dissolved organic matter dom in a groundwater by means of som which could characterize the composition and evolution of dom in the groundwater according to literature review a research with the aim of clustering the physicochemical parameters in surface water and groundwater to determine parameters with non linear relations was not found through this study surface water and groundwater pollution by landfill leachates was assessed according to analysis of the collected water samples around the tabriz city dumpsite the objectives were to 1 investigate the temporal and spatial influence of tabriz city dumpsite leachate on the surface water and groundwater quality of the region 2 evaluate the performance of lwpi measure in determining polluted regions in comparison to linear i e pca and nonlinear i e som clustering methods the originality of the current study lies on evaluation of lwpi performance using 10 water quality parameters comparing with the results of linear pca and nonlinear som used as dimension reduction methods on a significant number of physicochemical water quality parameters in this study 23 parameters which has not been addressed in the literature so far the application of som using the spatial and temporal entity on physicochemical water quality parameters can be considered as another novelty of current study moreover assessing the water quality of region to demonstrate pollution range according to tabriz city unsanitary dump site seems to be a practical implication for the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area tabriz latitude 38 08 n longitude 46 29 e is the capital city of east azerbaijan province at north west of iran the weather is semi arid with regular seasons the annual precipitation of tabriz is around 280 mm and mostly falls in wet seasons i e october to april the average temperature during summer and winter times is 25 and 2 c respectively based on geological foundation of the region the area is covered by a sand formation which is underlain by a complex of boulder clay the dumpsite of the city which is located in north west of tabriz at the valley of the mountainous region with the area of approximately 70 ha has been operated since 1997 see fig 1 the quantity of the generated waste is roughly 1200 ton per day which like other developing countries mostly consists of organic materials almost all the waste that is transferred to the dumpsite is deposited although a sanitary landfill has recently been built beside the old dumpsite it does not operate as a sanitary landfill due to inaccuracy in construction and exploitation fig 1 2 2 sampling tabriz municipal solid waste has been dumped in the valleys of mountainous area at north east of the city for more than 20 years due to this unsanitary dumpsite surrounding water bodies are affected negatively by leachate thereby leachate flow from the hillsides of dumpsite toward the surface water i e komur river was observed a few years ago moreover during wet season and rainfall color change in texture of the trench due to leachate penetration at a part of hillside slope near komur river can be seen see fig 1 high amount of leachate flowing from the hillsides forced the authorities to build small wetlands along the leachate apparently the purpose of making such wetlands was to prevent leachate flowing from the hillsides to the river but the consequence was unfavorable because not only leachate could reach groundwater but also could seep into sub surface and pass the hillside slope to join komur river on the other hand during the precipitation the leachate overflows the wetlands and finds its way to komur river as streams from the hillsides according to fig 1 the surface water and groundwater sampling points are indicated by s and g respectively the s1 and g1 data gathering locations are located at the river and groundwater inflow to the dumpsite area so they were considered as the control samples other sampling points are placed at the outflow from the dumpsite where the probability of water pollution due to leachate is high it should be mentioned that the groundwater flow direction is like the seasonal river of komur from the mountains area toward the downstream in fig 1 the arrows drawn next to the groundwater samples indicate the direction of the groundwater flow the water depth contour map in fig 1 was prepared according to hydraulic head data obtained from the water authority of the east azerbaijan province in the upstream near the ground water control sample and downstream of komur river near g5 and g6 there were several wells more than 10 wells however near the dumpsite only 4 wells data i e g2 g3 and g4 were used to generate the counter map the main reason for the uncertainty is the small number of samples that could not be increased due to the economic conditions in the study 2 3 instrumental analysis one leachate sample with three surface water and six groundwater samples were collected twice per year during september 2016 to august 2017 for wet and dry seasons transported to the laboratory and stored at 4 c twenty three physicochemical parameters were monitored and analyzed the analyses of the physico chemical parameters were performed according to apha 2012 standard methods temperature ph total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec were measured in place where samples were collected the ionic balance error was computed by taking the relationship between the total major cations ca2 mg2 na and k and anions hco3 cl so4 2 for each set of complete analysis of water samples only samples which fall within 5 were reported in this study total organic carbon toc was analyzed by analytik jena toc analyzer multi n c 3100 germany and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah with hplc method with fluorescence detection samples for the metal analyses were preserved by the addition of hno3 the heavy metals were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma icp oes spectro arcos to establish the spatial and temporal variations in water quality based monitoring data water quality measure i e lwpi statistical analysis i e pca and cluster analysis i e som were applied in this study the basic concepts of the applied tools are explained briefly in the sub sections as follow 2 4 landfill water pollution index lwpi water quality measures are the appropriate way to handle numerous water quality indicators and determine the source of pollution according to talalaj 2014 lwpi takes into account 10 parameters i e ph ec pah toc and six heavy metals including cr hg zn pb cd and cu which according to european union regulation should be monitored obligatorily in groundwater near the landfill both during its exploitation and after the closure moreover the included parameters in lwpi are most of the variables applied in the calculation of the leachate pollution index lpi proposed by kumar and alappat 2005 in order to calculate lwpi the ratio si of secondary concentration outflow to primary concentration inflow was measured for all of the parameters talalaj 2014 1 s i c p c b where c p is the concentration of the i t h parameter in each of the polluted groundwater sample and c b is the concentration of the i t h parameter in the inflow groundwater sample for the ph the s i should be calculated by placing in the lower ph value as the ratio talalaj 2014 2 c p c b i f c b c p o r c b c p i f c p c b so lwpi is calculated according to the following equation talalaj 2014 3 lwpi i 1 n s i w i w i where lwpi is the quality index for groundwater impacted by a landfill w i is the weight of the i t h pollutant variable and n is the number of groundwater pollutants based on table 1 2 5 principal component analysis pca the laboratory analyses results were evaluated using multivariate statistical techniques of pca to clarify correlations between physicochemical parameters and identify the major patterns in the data set indeed pca as a statistical technique seeks a linear combination of variables such that the maximum variance is extracted from the variables it then removes this variance and seeks a second linear combination which explains the maximum proportion of the remaining variance and so on in this way the variance of a large data set of correlated parameters with a much smaller data set of uncorrelated pcs is explained zhang et al 2011 kapelewska et al 2019 the pcs acquired from original correlated parameters can provide information based on the most meaningful parameters that describe a whole data set allowing data reduction with minimum loss of original information helena et al 2000 selle et al 2013 in order to study more on the mathematical foundation of pca readers are referred to abdi and williams 2010 2 6 self organizing map som clusters homogeneous data with similar pattern and reduces their dimensionality the som structure contains components named nodes with a common arrangement of two dimensional hexagonal grid a weight vector of the same dimension as the input data vectors is assigned to each node in order to detect node with the closest smallest distance metric weight vector w to the n dimensional input vector x euclidean distance is utilized kohonen 1995 4 x w i 1 n x i w i 2 the weight with the closest match to the input data is the winner node named best matching unit bmu in order to further reduce the distance between the weights and bmu learning continue by changing the weights at each training iteration t kohonen 1995 5 w t 1 w t α t h lm x w t where α corresponds to the learning rate ranging in 01 and h lm denotes the neighborhood function the most commonly used neighborhood function is the gaussian function kohonen 1995 6 h lm e x p l m 2 2 σ t 2 where l and m correspond to bmu and its neighboring output nodes position and σ is the width of the topological neighborhood at iteration t 3 results and discussion tables 2 and 3 show the physico chemical water quality parameters analyzed during wet and dry seasons of year 2016 to 2017 according to tables 2 and 3 there is a large number of separate parameters on water quality determination which may not easily provide a general view on the level of water pollution by leachate therefore classification of data is needed to reduce dimensionality of data which may make the application of water quality indicator more straightforward in this way lwpi was used in this study to determine the pollution probability due to leachate in the sampling points afterwards two data mining methods i e pca and som were applied over all the measured parameters to cluster the samples with similar water quality together in this way lwpi based polluted samples were compared with the results of clustering methods to see if lwpi with only 10 parameters could confirm the results of data mining methods trained by means of numerous parameters i e 23 parameters here in this study 3 1 physicochemical and lwpi analysis the average results of physicochemical analyses of the samples including inflow and outflow from tabriz dumpsite were reported in tables 2 and 3 where the obtained results were compared to the who water quality standards who 2011 moreover the leachate sampling results are shown in table 4 the results of the detailed analyses for both dry and wet seasons at sampling points were tabulated in appendix see tables a1 and a2 it is noteworthy that the ph value of the leachate sample from tabriz dumpsite showed an alkaline nature indicating that the dumpsite could be classified as mature to old stage rana et al 2018 although the ph values for all groundwater samples are within the range of who standards who 2011 the inflow groundwater ph g1 was less than the values near the landfill g2 and g3 moreover in the far away outflows i e g4 and g5 the ph range was shown to be decrease due to distance from the landfill the observed ph in the surface water showed increasing trend so that the s1 sample as the inflow had value less than neutral but s2 sample despite being inflow as well showed an increase in ph value proportion to s1 such increase might be due to the existence of a chicken slaughterhouse before landfill which probably enters its wastewater illegally to the nearest surface water the sample s2 was taken from the surface water exactly in the vicinity of slaughterhouse where there were not any other pollution resource such as plants or even any kind of buildings moreover the samples s1 and s3 were taken from the locations before and after the slaughterhouse where the increased ph source in s2 is probably due to slaughterhouse furthermore in the history of the google earth map there is a probable pollution track of wastewater from slaughterhouse which drains to the komur river see fig 2 landfill leachate can affect groundwater ec by increasing the dissolved inorganic ions talalaj and biedka 2016 the ec value in the inflow groundwater has been increased compared to the outflows in both dry and wet seasons however the ec values in dry season are higher than that of the wet seasons this relates to the decrease of precipitation and increase of evapotranspiration so that the density of dissolved inorganic ions in groundwater increases chemical analysis of the heavy metals showed different metal concentrations in inflow and outflow of surface water and groundwater in this regard the concentrations of zn cr cu fe mn ni b ba and co in the outflow groundwater samples have been increased with respect to inflow concentration this result demonstrates the heavy metal pollution potential of landfill leachate the mechanism of heavy metal adsorption through the soil is deliberated by sangiumsak and punrattanasin 2014 in two phases first phase is heavy metals seep through the soil whereas a large amount is adsorbed by soil however in the second phase the adsorption rate decreases with time until almost an inability to adsorb comes some of the analyzed heavy metals i e pb cd as al hg mo sn v in the outflow groundwater samples did not exceed the inflow concentrations although their concentration was reportedly high in the leachate i e pb cd as this might be due to sorption of heavy metals on organic colloids and natural barrier performance of soil in the study area against some heavy metals awanm et al 2003 jiang et al 2010 the adsorption of metals from liquid phase into their solid phase is the dominant factor that controls the behaviors of heavy metals while passing through soil srivastava et al 2005 sangiumsak and punrattanasin 2014 for more information on adsorption of heavy metal ions on soils and influencing factors soils constituents and empirical and mechanistic adsorption models the readers are referred to the review paper by bradl 2004 the included heavy metals in lwpi measure are pb cu hg and cr where cr and cu showed increasing trend in groundwater due to leachate while pb and hg had constant concentrations the order of maximum heavy metal pollution which occurred at outflow groundwater with regard to inflow is as follows ba mn ni co fe cr cu b the change percent range for these heavy metals in outflow to inflow groundwater is 13 97 the minimum exceedance 13 increase relates to b concentration while the other metals have been increased more than 70 the landfill leachate is one of the anthropogenic sources that can lead to b exceedance in outflow groundwater voutsa et al 2009 taghipour et al 2012 the 96 increase of ba in the outflow groundwater can suggest not only the presence of landfill leachate but also industrial waste oil and gas contaminated fluid coal waste paints corrosion inhibitors and deicing products as well lagas et al 1984 since there is no industrial unit in the study area the only ba pollution source can be associated with landfill leachate that penetrate to the groundwater although mn and fe concentration in groundwater can be due to natural constituent of groundwater in this studied area spatial changes in mn and fe concentration and on the other hand the high concentration of mn and fe in tabriz dumpsite leachate demonstrate leachate based source for mn and fe el salam and abu zuid 2015 chidichimo et al 2020 moreover high concentration of ni co cr and cu in dumpsite leachate as well as increased concentration of mentioned metals in sample g4 delineate that the pollution source in groundwater is dumpsite leachate among the six heavy metals i e cr hg zn pb cd and cu involved in lwpi measure only cr and cu concentration in outflow has exceeded the inflow values although the concentration of zn pb cd in leachate was high but the attenuation process in soil did not lead to the penetration of these metals into groundwater the concentration of heavy metals in surface water at the sampling points including two inflows and one outflow has been increased in the following order ni cr ba zn mn fe al b cu however the higher concentration of the metals in bold type in the inflow groundwater was reported with respect to outflow which means that upstream water is already polluted by local pollution sources the effluent of chicken slaughterhouse which is located before the landfill i e between s1 and s2 might be the principal reason therefore in order to have precise judgment on how dumpsite leachate affects the surface water and the role of chicken slaughterhouse it is necessary to have numerous sampling through the river between s2 and s3 among the tested physiochemical elements halogens cl and br did not meet the standards of who water quality whereas in groundwater samples the elevated concentration of cl and br after landfill can elucidate landfill as the potential pollution sources in surface waters the amount of chlorine and bromine in all three sections of the river is higher than allowed limit and have increasing trend from s1 to s3 since there is not any industrial plants or pollution source in the nearby area it is resulted that the increasing trend of cl and br from s1 to s3 can be influenced by the chicken slaughterhouse wastewater this outcome is in agreements with various studies that consider cl and br as tracer elements which determine the elevated concentration of cl and br in surface and groundwater can serve as the indicators of water resources pollution due to unsanitary dumpsite goldberg and kabengi 2010 korom and seaman 2012 naveen et al 2018 chen et al 2019 according to review study of venkatesan and swaminathan 2009 near landfill sites cl concentration used to assess infiltrations of leachate plume from sanitary landfills into the groundwater soil water and river water near landfills in order to trace movement of contamination moreover it is noted that the concentrations of cl and br during the wet season reported more than dry season due to occurrence of more precipitation in this season which this conforms results of bech et al 2017 research where indicated that br concentration in soil water varies both spatially and temporally and is influenced by soil type and irrigation among several physicochemical parameters in tables 2 and 3 the toc and pah are indicators of dissolved organic matter in analyzed samples where the existence of these two parameters together in water can be the indicator of leachate leaking into that water talalaj 2014 the increasing trend of toc and pah in both surface water and groundwater proves the leachate penetration into the water bodies in the area the toc is often used as a nonspecific indicator of the water quality however several studies e g daou et al 2016 krčmar et al 2018 przydatek and kanownik 2019 conducted studies which indicated toc footprint in water resources surrounding the landfills due to leachate leakage to groundwater toc results from a decaying organic matter i e humic acid fulvic acid amines and urea and synthetic sources i e detergents pesticides fertilizers industrial chemicals and chlorinated organics that are found abundantly in leachate hendricks 2007 in the current study area toc in the outflow water samples ranged from 10 92 to 616 6 mg l while the concentration was higher in the outflow samples than inflow as can be seen in fig 3 toc amount in surface water samples and the groundwater sample g4 the most impacted well by leachate is increasing during both wet and dry seasons however zhao et al 2018 and nienie et al 2017 observed the decreasing trend of toc during dry season the reason beyond contrary results of current study with the mentioned previous studies lies on diverse situation of study areas in the current study the tabriz city dumpsite which is the major and somehow only reason of toc pollution in surrounding water resources is located outside the city s residential area without any industry plants therefore although during the dry season due to decrease of rainfall toc concentration is increased in seasonal komur river during the wet season of a semidry region like tabriz not only tangible difference in leachate dilution cannot be seen in samples but also due to increase of leachate generation because of rainfall increase the pollution potential of leachate is also increased however the study area in zhao et al 2018 is the lanzhou city where is a center for heavy industry and petrochemical industry therefore the toc amount can be elevated during precipitation which pollutions be washed out to the permanent and watery yellow river throughout all the industrial region so not only the landfill can effect on elevated toc results but also the industrial contaminations can do the study area at the research of nienie et al 2017 is the suburban areas of kikwit where the water samples were collected from three main wells and two rivers which drain the city of kikwit since these rivers are the main drainages used for domestic activities it is expected that the toc amount is increased during wet season because the rivers are fed with the organic matters i e humic acid fulvic acid amines and urea or detergents pesticides fertilizers industrial chemicals and chlorinated organics that can originate from residential places in addition to landfill leachate on the other hand the climate of the region soil material waste composition leachate pollution rate groundwater depth are effective factors in pollutants transfer pattern to groundwater talalaj 2014 indicated that the high values of toc and pah together in water quality analysis are the 1 s of pollution due to leachate the pahs are one of the most widespread organic pollutants the pah can be found in a coal tar bitumen crude oil and roofing tar they are also used for medicines dyes plastics and pesticides such as naphthalene found in mothballs the mean value of the pah in the outflow was higher than the inflow water during both seasons while the pah contamination during wet season was considerable than dry season this suggests the dumpsite as the pah pollution source due to the lack of waste separation and recycling burial overall the lwpi results in table 5 declare the increasing trend in surface water and groundwater when approaching the dumpsite according to talalaj 2014 the pollution range based on lwpi is divided into four categories if lwpi 1 there is no landfill leachate pollution impact on the sampled water 1 lwpi 2 there is moderately polluted water due to landfill leachate 2 lwpi 5 there is high visible landfill leachate impact on the sampled water and lwpi greater than 5 there is strongly polluted water under an evidently very high landfill leachate impact according to the pollution range division the surface water was highly polluted even at inflow however the leachate impact at outflow of the landfill was increased due to dumpsite effect in case of groundwater the lwpi values at sampling points before and after g4 were reported to be 2 but in sample g4 lwpi had been dramatically increased to above 30 fig 4 shows the figurative idea of the spatial distribution of the lwpi average in both seasons around the sampling points since ordinary kriging method suffers smoothing effect as the small observed values are usually overestimated and large values are underestimated idw method preferred herein to develop fig 4 idw method often performs better than other classic simple spatial interpolation techniques the reason lies behind the way it models spatial variability kriging and some other methods perform smoothing while modelling spatial variability whereas idw models it by fitting straight lines through the observations therefore the estimated values are more close to the observation and get decreased by the distance weights as the estimated locations get further away known as bull s eye effect where using denser observations can reduce this effect bronowicka mielniczuk et al 2019 however it should be noted that the observations likely come usually with errors that can be reduced by performing smoothing e g via kriging in spatial variability modelling so though idw performs better in case of satisfactory number of observations it s not necessarily superior when the observations include high level of error according to fig 4 sampling points near dumpsite i e s3 g4 show the maximum pollution rate although the temporal analysis of lwpi indicated that during wet season the rate of pollution was more than dry season the rate of spatial change in pollution rate in both seasons was similar this outcome confirms the results of other studies which assess seasonal variability of water quality by physicochemical parameters zhao et al 2018 nienie et al 2017 since the dumpsite has no surface water collection system the runoff originated from upstream flows toward dumpsite which is located in at the valleys of mountainous area so the run of easily enters the waste then the runoff not only infiltrates passes through the waste and descends into the soil but also in its rout pathway to downstream it is combined with leachate that is collected behind the leachate collection decks which is mentioned as wetlands before and then the polluted water flows through the hillside to reach komur river according to lwpi results in table 5 groundwater pollution is more severe than surface water pollution in the area while the surface water was polluted even before reaching the dumpsite surroundings although dumpsite leachate has increased the pollution rate the most polluted point is g4 sampling well located in the south east of the dumpsite near the s3 surface water sampling point see fig 4 g4 has been polluted due to leachate penetration in line with the land slope which is from the dumpsite toward well g4 in spite of higher variation of ground elevation between dumpsite located at a mountainous area and g4 well located near the komur river g4 well is impacted immensely by leachate that corresponds to quantity and quality of leachate and the sandy soil type of the region the reason for the s3 pollution is dependent on leachate and contaminated runoffs during precipitation which originated from highlands and passed through the dumpsite and end at komur river in order to study the polluted area in accordance to all analyzed physicochemical parameters two data mining methods i e pca and som were applied on several data during both seasons to determine the regions with similar water quality in this way by assessing the lwpi results and the locations with similar water quality obtained from pca and som the leachate impacted area could be interpreted 3 2 pca lwpi analyses in sampling points helped to understand the leachate polluted points and also the scale of surface water and groundwater deterioration caused by leachate however only 10 parameters among several physicochemical parameters of tables 2 and 3 were used to conceive the result of lwpi pca as a statistical technique used all physicochemical parameters of tables 2 and 3 to extract the most important ones in assessing variation of water quality in order to develop pca model matrix x with 18 rows and 23 columns were developed where lines of x correspond to variables in water sampling points at wet and dry seasons and columns to physicochemical measurements obtained from analysis of real samples data in tables 2 and 3 by decomposing the matrix x into a matrix product s l t t refers to transposed matrix pca produces orthogonal components where s denotes scores matrix and l is the loadings matrix that explains the responsible variables for patterns found in scores matrix cordella et al 2012 in order to accomplish pca on data matrix x first standardization with mean centering of each variable and dividing the resulting values by standard deviation was performed according to the criteria of eigenvalue one five pcs were identified to explain 89 3 of the total variance of the dataset in which the first pc with 42 9 of variance indicated all the wells despite the most polluted i e g4 and inflow i e g1 wells it could be indicated by the strong positive loadings on the g2 g3 g5 and g6 variables in table 6 the second pc with 21 5 of variance indicated surface water inflow samples i e s1 s2 the third pc with 10 9 of variance indicated inflow well i e g1 and utmost outflow wells i e g5 g6 which can be considered as unpolluted wells pc4 with 8 9 of variance had significant loadings on g4 and s3 which indicated the most polluted points including surface water and groundwater i e g4 and s3 the fifth pc with 5 4 of variance suggests the important loadings related to observatory surface water sample i e s1 indeed according to table 6 spatial analysis based on water quality of the region was performed and five distinct groups according to water quality of the sampling points were distinguished pca clustered samples according to water quality characteristics of surface water and groundwater into unpolluted semi polluted and polluted locations impacted by leachate the ability of pca as a multivariate statistical method to analyze attributes of physicochemical data and determine the significant independent variables was shown in fig 5 by pc plots of dominant components for loadings and scores which respectively depict the contribution of dominant physicochemical parameters in different components and the potential spatiotemporal discrimination of samples by assessing the precipitation series in wet and dry seasons according to fig 5 loadings of the first component pc1 can be characterized by mineral parameters ec total hardness tds ca mg na k and cl accordingly the scores of the pc1 revels the dominancy of surface water sampling points s1 s2 and s3 during dry season where decrease of rainfall is observed in precipitation series see fig 5 this increase could be explained by a certain concentration effect of mineral and anthropogenic parameters due to less precipitations and higher temperatures when approaching the dry season in the study area the second component pc2 fig 5 principally represents organic character comprising higher loadings for toc no3 and pah which corresponds to landfill leachate according to the scores plot of pc2 the most polluted well due to organic pollution is g4 in both dry and wet seasons where was selected as the most impacted well based on lwpi as well although at the first glance it seems that the concentration of leachate can be reduced in the wet season due to rainfall increase and the decrease of pollution concentration the pollution range in g4 at both seasons dominated equally the reason could rely on the fact that maximum pollution was occurred in groundwater sample and not in surface water whereas in such a dry region even at wet season the precipitation amount is low see the precipitation time series in fig 5 so the decrease of pollution concentration due to increase in rainfall might not be so tangible on the other hand the studied landfill is unsanitary without proper coverage where increase of the rainfall has elevated the production of leachate so the concentration of pollution did not decline during wet season however according to pc3 scores the increase of surface water pollution in surface water samples at s3 is observed according to the loadings of pc3 organic parameters are dominant as the elevated weight of cod shows the existence of non biodegradable organics also high levels of toc no2 nh3 and pah are indicators of the organic pollution especially for sampling point s3 which among the surface water samples is the nearest sampling point to the landfill the high scores of s3 in both dry and wet seasons demonstrate the maximum organic pollution concentration due to the landfill leachate looking at the scores on the pc3 fig 5 an increasing trend can be noticed on surface water samples at wet season where the scores are increasing when going down from upstream to downstream this evolution could be clearly highlighted by the scores corresponding to the punctual environmental violation like an illegal wastewater discharge from chicken slaughter house occurring before s2 and landfill leachate discharge from unsanitary landfill near s3 3 3 self organizing map analysis som as a nonlinear ann based clustering technique was used to spatially classify the physicochemical properties of sampling points during two seasons the total number of neurons in som was determined based on the formula suggested by vesanto 2000 5 n 21 where n is the number of samples afterwards among various combinations of map dimension the appropriate map size was set to 7 3 according to quantization error qe and topographic error te criteria garcıa and gonzalez 2004 once the map size of som had been determined the weight distance matrix or u matrix and input planes were visualized in fig 6 the input planes which were named with physicochemical parameters in fig 6 show weight planes for each element of the input vector they are visualizations of the weights that connect each input to each of the neurons darker colors represent larger weights if the connection patterns of two inputs are very similar it can be assumed that the inputs are highly correlated in this study the input planes of ec total hardness tds ca2 na and cl are similar and consequently these parameters are correlated total alkalinity and hco3 also demonstrate identical planes overall the input planes of som is an appropriate tool to assess the interrelationship of the different water quality parameters in the clustering the plot in the last column of fig 6 which was named som weight neighbor distances shows u matrix where the small hexagons represent the neurons and the large ones visualize the distances between neurons and show connection to neighbor neurons by the lines in the large hexagons of the u matrix the darker colors represent larger distances and the lighter colors represent smaller distances one of the advantages of u matrix maps is the ease of extracting clustering with visual judgment of maps before assessing the obtained analytical results so this visualization ability distinguishes som from other clustering methods like pca according to dotted polygons on som neighbor weight distance plot fig 6 which obtained from visualization of authors there might be four clusters in this way two clusters can be assumed at the lower part of the som neighbor weight distance plot by following a band of dark segments crosses from the right bottom corner to the mid left region the other cluster can be the vertical dark band at the upper part of the figure which is separated from lighter colored region in the upper left the final cluster can be depicted in the upper right side of the map with lighter colors therefore based on visual understanding of the authors four clusters were imagined however in order to precisely determine the optimal number of the clusters k means algorithm with davies bouldin clustering index was used garcía and gonzález 2004 davies bouldin clustering index minimizes within clusters distance and maximizes between clusters distance so in accordance with k means which yields low values it indicates good clustering results for spherical clusters garcía and gonzález 2004 according to fig 7 the optimal clustering number corresponds to 5 clusters whereas the davies bouldin clustering index is minimized once the optimum clustering number has been selected the position of five distinct clusters were drawn in fig 8 according to som clustering results determined via davies bouldin clustering index which are tabulated in table 7 the comparison of figs 6 and 8 indicates the similarity between visual and analytical result of som based clustering where unless clusters one and three which were assumed identical all the assumptions came right this is the superiority of som visualization maps which extract nonlinear relations in 2 d map and lead to fast judgment before spending time on analytical consequences according to table 7 the first cluster identifies surface water at inflow in both seasons i e s1 and s2 in dry season the second cluster presents the most polluted well in wet and dry seasons i e g4 the third cluster shows the most polluted surface water sample s3 in dry and wet seasons in addition to s3 as the polluted surface water at the outflow of dumpsite s2 sample in the wet season due to high range of pollution in water quality because of chicken slaughterhouse was also grouped in the third cluster the fourth cluster displays the inflow groundwater samples in both seasons i e g1 g2 and g3 the last cluster includes the groundwater samples at the outflow of dumpsite which are fairly far from the dumpsite in this way som spatially clustered the samples according to their polluting potential 3 4 comparison of the lwpi pca and som outcomes owing to the results of som and pca clustering it is inferred that both models had similar performance in grouping data whereas the outcomes led to determination of regions with low moderate and high potential of water quality deterioration evaluation of lwpi results also determined the spatial pollution range due to leachate in the study area the comparison of clustering results and lwpi led to identical consequence in spatial analysis of water quality therefore in similar cases it would be profitable timesaving and efficient to use lwpi with only 10 parameters instead of complicated clustering methods which were implemented based on several physicochemical parameters according to tables 6 and 7 pca and som classified s3 and g4 separately from the other data which according to table 5 and lwpi results demonstrated the most polluted points the considerable difference between som and pca methods was grouping s3 and g4 samples together in pca and separated in som however som clustering pattern seems to be more efficient than pca because the polluted surface water and groundwater could be clustered separately which relates to nonlinear entity of som that can differentiate pollution in surface water and groundwater because the water pollution in the surface water occurs due to leachate flow to the river but groundwater is polluted due to leachate penetration through layers of soil where attenuation can change pollution order and type leachate as a highly polluted wastewater contains a wide range of contaminants including organic and inorganic matters humic and fulvic substances and even heavy metals during passing of leachate into groundwater the soil constituent naturally transforms contaminants to less harmful forms or immobilize contaminants so that they have less threats to the environment different mechanisms have influence on the transport of pollutants from soil layers to groundwater e g diffusion adsorption precipitation and decay therefore the nature of the pollutants except trace elements change while passing through the soil layers for example soil microorganisms play important roles in nitrogen cycling within the soil which can derive nitrification or denitrification therefore removal of nitrogen out of the leachate in soil occurs that leads to biological water purification however in case of surface water the leachate flow is over the surface without passing soil layers which can effect on pollutant characteristics the extraction of dominant physicochemical parameters by means of pca and som methods approved the efficiency of similar parameters used in lwpi in this way according to fig 5 the dominant parameters based on loadings in pc1 were ec total hardness tds ca2 na k and cl while in fig 6 these parameters denoted the similar pattern in input plans the spatial clustering outcomes of these parameters in both pca and som denoted to surface water as inflow specifically in dry season where natural mineral parameters are responsible as the dominant parameters assessing table 1 revealed ec as the important parameter for lwpi which is admitted by pca component1 and som cluster 1 dominants in the pc 2 fig 5 toc in the first rank and pah no3 in the second rank are the most dominant parameters however based on input plans fig 6 toc no3 and pah show similar pattern albeit pah weights are a bit less evaluation of lwpi parameters discloses pah and toc as the important parameters that play crucial role in leachate pollution the spatial analysis of pca component 2 and som cluster 2 denoted g4 as the most impacted sampling site according toc no3 and pah finally in pc3 of pca fig 5 cod toc no2 nh3 and pah are reported as the effective loadings whereas in fig 6 parameters no2 nh3 show identical input plan as cod toc and somehow pah shows in the corresponding component and cluster the s3 sampling point is presented overall the comparison of results obtained via lwpi pca and som methods verified that lwpi can be a valid cost effective and time saving alternative to pca and som which can be moved onto other sites becoming an outcome of broad applicability 4 conclusion since the water resources i e surface water and groundwater in the region are subjected to leachate pollution in an effort the scale of the surface water and groundwater pollution due to the generated leachate since 20 years ago was investigated however water pollution assessment needs the interpretation of numerous water quality data with complex and non linear relationship between data so pca and som were used to discover the complex relationship among surface water and groundwater data lwpi measure with only ten physicochemical parameters was used to quickly and effectively streamline the numerous data and discern pollution rate with spatially and temporally water quality analysis data in this regard pca and som tools were applied to evaluate lwpi measure efficiency the summary of achieved results was categorized as follow the physicochemical water quality parameters which exceeded the permitted limits indicate that there is contamination in the water resources of the region due to leakage of leachate to groundwater and surface water the lwpi as an indicator to determine water pollution with the source of landfill leachate revealed that tabriz city dumpsite had the most negative impact on the surface water and groundwater at s3 and g4 sampling points the temporal evaluation of water pollution indicated that during the wet season the lwpi values were higher than dry season because precipitation and runoff transport contaminations pca and som applied to cluster numerous physicochemical and heavy metal parameters in various sampling points and in diverse seasons pca showed that 5 components account for 89 3 of total variance for the surface water and groundwater pollution the som clustering method also identified five clusters where the spatial water pollution was determined it was confirmed that both pca and som methods function efficiently with similar outcomes in characterizing sampling points as low moderate and high polluted regions although pca demonstrated proper capability in handling multivariable data set som due to nonlinear entity could detect the complex properties of analyzed data more precisely as such som could cluster s3 as the most polluted surface water and g4 as the most polluted groundwater separately the practical implication of this work was evaluating the efficiency of lwpi in determining the contaminated water resources due to landfill leachate with less water quality parameters analysis which is more cost effective whereas the efficiency of lwpi was verified via pca and som with plenty of water quality parameters finally due to poor condition of the surface water and groundwater in the surrounding area of tabriz city dump site the immediate remediation policies to purify the water is required furthermore solid waste management as well as providing several engineered landfill cells to prevent water resources pollution in the region is the vital issue declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

5107,in this study spatiotemporal variation of water pollution near a municipal solid waste dumpsite was investigated for this purpose the analyses of heavy metals and 23 physicochemical parameters were performed three surface water and six groundwater resources both in dry and wet seasons were monitored between september 2016 and august 2017 landfill water pollution index lwpi was calculated and the results were compared with those obtained from principal component analysis pca and self organizing map som the important objective of spatiotemporal pollution assessment of surface water and groundwater was to evaluate the performance of lwpi measure in determining polluted regions in comparison to linear i e pca and nonlinear i e som clustering methods the results indicated low water quality in both surface water and groundwater due to leachate penetration surface water and groundwater samples close to the dumpsite showed the most pollution impact according to lwpi where for samples with lwpi 1 are considered as polluted water due to landfill leachate in this study the polluted samples ranged from 1 to 42 5 with the mean value of 7 46 the seasonal assessment of pollution indicated that more severe leachate impact was observed during the wet season the clustering results indicated that both pca and som categorized surface water and groundwater samples into five clusters while lwpi classified them into three groups including unpolluted semi polluted and polluted regions in spite of different numbers of clusters the pca and som and lwpi results showed identical outcome about range of pollution in spatial analysis of water quality therefore application of lwpi with only ten parameters instead of pca and som clustering methods which were implemented based on several physicochemical parameters is suggested as the main practical implication of this study keywords groundwater landfill water pollution index lwpi landfill leachate principal component analysis pca surface water self organizing map som 1 introduction lack of fresh water resources is one of the main challenges in the recent century due to shortage of sufficient availablewater resources especially in arid and semi arid areas the protection of existing water resources has the prime importance municipal waste and landfilling is one of the main cause of water pollution around the world in spite of great improvements in municipal solid waste management actions including reduction recycling composting and incineration landfilling as a final step of solid waste management and disposal is still mandatory cheng et al 2011 landfills and dumpsites are potential water pollution sources due to leachate generation which migrates into the water bodies foufoua et al 2017 water pollution due to the leachate migration is considered as a serious environmental threat and is dependent on leachate age solid waste degradation rate composition and amount of the leachate landfill location distance from water bodies soil type climatic conditions and etc talalaj and biedka 2016 water pollution has been reported as a potential health problem and a good number of studies have developed various measures to properly monitor water quality liu and kuo 2003 gibrilla et al 2011 the use of such measures reduces the difficulties of processing numerous water quality indicators and can be helpful in diagnosing diverse sources of pollution some of these measures are mentioned as follows world health organization who standards for drinking water gibrilla et al 2011 horton s water quality index wqi as a rating to show the composite influence of different water quality parameters abbasi and abbasi 2012 brown s index as the modified wqi with much greater precision in selecting parameters brown et al 1970 multiplicative water quality index dinius 1987 and the oregon water quality index owqi cude 2007 although the latter index can help to assess the water quality management activities more effectively it should not be adopted for evaluation of water resources in a strongly polluted landfill area talalaj and biedka 2016 talalaj 2014 introduced a landfill water pollution index lwpi to evaluate water pollution due to landfill leachate lwpi provides a convenient and appropriate measure to recognize water pollution with landfill source which has been applied in the recent studies e g talalaj and biedka 2016 foufoua et al 2017 krčmar et al 2018 kapelewska et al 2019 beside the water quality assessment measures several cluster analyses and multivariate statistical techniques have been used over physicochemical data of water analysis to discern pollution source and major responsible factors in water pollution huang et al 2015 kim et al 2016 guo et al 2018 water quality parameters are usually inter correlated and the efficient assessment without data classification seems unreasonable in this way cluster analysis and multivariate statistical approaches allow the deriving of hidden information from physicochemical data so proper decisions on managing contaminated water resources would be possible several clustering methods such as hierarchical clustering rokach and maimon 2005 k means clustering kanungo et al 2002 principal component analysis pca abdi and williams 2010 multivariate normal distributions genz and bretz 2009 and unsupervised neural network called self organizing map som kohonen 1995 have been proposed for water quality data classification in this study two techniques i e pca and som of mentioned clustering methods were used to determine the possible influences of a landfill on water quality of a region the principal components pcs are the linear combination of observed data with maximum variations and minimum loss of the original information owing to the fact that selection of the pcs is provided based on linear variance covariance relation among data the pcs provide information for interpreting the most significant physicochemical parameters pca has been successfully applied to interpret water quality parameters in several studies e g jayakumar and siraz 1997 vermonden et al 2009 daou et al 2016 since there is not only linear relation between physicochemical parameters of water quality detecting the nonlinear relations can also be profitable in diagnosing the water quality of a region therefore the application of a nonlinear clustering method i e som to determine the relation between parameters can provide distinct aspect of clustering simeonova et al 2010 yang et al 2012 voyslavov et al 2012 nourani et al 2013 an et al 2016 wu et al 2016 li et al 2018 few studies have employed som to identify landfill effects on the surrounding water quality pearce et al 2011 bieroza et al 2009 he and fan 2016 in this regard pearce et al 2011 evaluated groundwater contamination by landfill leachate using microbial community profile data and a nonparametric decision making process they used som to weight the input variables which are obtained from pca based on their relative importance and provide statistical guidance for classifying the microbial data similarities he and fan 2016 investigated the effect of landfill leachates on the characteristics of dissolved organic matter dom in a groundwater by means of som which could characterize the composition and evolution of dom in the groundwater according to literature review a research with the aim of clustering the physicochemical parameters in surface water and groundwater to determine parameters with non linear relations was not found through this study surface water and groundwater pollution by landfill leachates was assessed according to analysis of the collected water samples around the tabriz city dumpsite the objectives were to 1 investigate the temporal and spatial influence of tabriz city dumpsite leachate on the surface water and groundwater quality of the region 2 evaluate the performance of lwpi measure in determining polluted regions in comparison to linear i e pca and nonlinear i e som clustering methods the originality of the current study lies on evaluation of lwpi performance using 10 water quality parameters comparing with the results of linear pca and nonlinear som used as dimension reduction methods on a significant number of physicochemical water quality parameters in this study 23 parameters which has not been addressed in the literature so far the application of som using the spatial and temporal entity on physicochemical water quality parameters can be considered as another novelty of current study moreover assessing the water quality of region to demonstrate pollution range according to tabriz city unsanitary dump site seems to be a practical implication for the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area tabriz latitude 38 08 n longitude 46 29 e is the capital city of east azerbaijan province at north west of iran the weather is semi arid with regular seasons the annual precipitation of tabriz is around 280 mm and mostly falls in wet seasons i e october to april the average temperature during summer and winter times is 25 and 2 c respectively based on geological foundation of the region the area is covered by a sand formation which is underlain by a complex of boulder clay the dumpsite of the city which is located in north west of tabriz at the valley of the mountainous region with the area of approximately 70 ha has been operated since 1997 see fig 1 the quantity of the generated waste is roughly 1200 ton per day which like other developing countries mostly consists of organic materials almost all the waste that is transferred to the dumpsite is deposited although a sanitary landfill has recently been built beside the old dumpsite it does not operate as a sanitary landfill due to inaccuracy in construction and exploitation fig 1 2 2 sampling tabriz municipal solid waste has been dumped in the valleys of mountainous area at north east of the city for more than 20 years due to this unsanitary dumpsite surrounding water bodies are affected negatively by leachate thereby leachate flow from the hillsides of dumpsite toward the surface water i e komur river was observed a few years ago moreover during wet season and rainfall color change in texture of the trench due to leachate penetration at a part of hillside slope near komur river can be seen see fig 1 high amount of leachate flowing from the hillsides forced the authorities to build small wetlands along the leachate apparently the purpose of making such wetlands was to prevent leachate flowing from the hillsides to the river but the consequence was unfavorable because not only leachate could reach groundwater but also could seep into sub surface and pass the hillside slope to join komur river on the other hand during the precipitation the leachate overflows the wetlands and finds its way to komur river as streams from the hillsides according to fig 1 the surface water and groundwater sampling points are indicated by s and g respectively the s1 and g1 data gathering locations are located at the river and groundwater inflow to the dumpsite area so they were considered as the control samples other sampling points are placed at the outflow from the dumpsite where the probability of water pollution due to leachate is high it should be mentioned that the groundwater flow direction is like the seasonal river of komur from the mountains area toward the downstream in fig 1 the arrows drawn next to the groundwater samples indicate the direction of the groundwater flow the water depth contour map in fig 1 was prepared according to hydraulic head data obtained from the water authority of the east azerbaijan province in the upstream near the ground water control sample and downstream of komur river near g5 and g6 there were several wells more than 10 wells however near the dumpsite only 4 wells data i e g2 g3 and g4 were used to generate the counter map the main reason for the uncertainty is the small number of samples that could not be increased due to the economic conditions in the study 2 3 instrumental analysis one leachate sample with three surface water and six groundwater samples were collected twice per year during september 2016 to august 2017 for wet and dry seasons transported to the laboratory and stored at 4 c twenty three physicochemical parameters were monitored and analyzed the analyses of the physico chemical parameters were performed according to apha 2012 standard methods temperature ph total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec were measured in place where samples were collected the ionic balance error was computed by taking the relationship between the total major cations ca2 mg2 na and k and anions hco3 cl so4 2 for each set of complete analysis of water samples only samples which fall within 5 were reported in this study total organic carbon toc was analyzed by analytik jena toc analyzer multi n c 3100 germany and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah with hplc method with fluorescence detection samples for the metal analyses were preserved by the addition of hno3 the heavy metals were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma icp oes spectro arcos to establish the spatial and temporal variations in water quality based monitoring data water quality measure i e lwpi statistical analysis i e pca and cluster analysis i e som were applied in this study the basic concepts of the applied tools are explained briefly in the sub sections as follow 2 4 landfill water pollution index lwpi water quality measures are the appropriate way to handle numerous water quality indicators and determine the source of pollution according to talalaj 2014 lwpi takes into account 10 parameters i e ph ec pah toc and six heavy metals including cr hg zn pb cd and cu which according to european union regulation should be monitored obligatorily in groundwater near the landfill both during its exploitation and after the closure moreover the included parameters in lwpi are most of the variables applied in the calculation of the leachate pollution index lpi proposed by kumar and alappat 2005 in order to calculate lwpi the ratio si of secondary concentration outflow to primary concentration inflow was measured for all of the parameters talalaj 2014 1 s i c p c b where c p is the concentration of the i t h parameter in each of the polluted groundwater sample and c b is the concentration of the i t h parameter in the inflow groundwater sample for the ph the s i should be calculated by placing in the lower ph value as the ratio talalaj 2014 2 c p c b i f c b c p o r c b c p i f c p c b so lwpi is calculated according to the following equation talalaj 2014 3 lwpi i 1 n s i w i w i where lwpi is the quality index for groundwater impacted by a landfill w i is the weight of the i t h pollutant variable and n is the number of groundwater pollutants based on table 1 2 5 principal component analysis pca the laboratory analyses results were evaluated using multivariate statistical techniques of pca to clarify correlations between physicochemical parameters and identify the major patterns in the data set indeed pca as a statistical technique seeks a linear combination of variables such that the maximum variance is extracted from the variables it then removes this variance and seeks a second linear combination which explains the maximum proportion of the remaining variance and so on in this way the variance of a large data set of correlated parameters with a much smaller data set of uncorrelated pcs is explained zhang et al 2011 kapelewska et al 2019 the pcs acquired from original correlated parameters can provide information based on the most meaningful

discussion tables 2 and 3 show the physico chemical water quality parameters analyzed during wet and dry seasons of year 2016 to 2017 according to tables 2 and 3 there is a large number of separate parameters on water quality determination which may not easily provide a general view on the level of water pollution by leachate therefore classification of data is needed to reduce dimensionality of data which may make the application of water quality indicator more straightforward in this way lwpi was used in this study to determine the pollution probability due to leachate in the sampling points afterwards two data mining methods i e pca and som were applied over all the measured parameters to cluster the samples with similar water quality together in this way lwpi based polluted samples were compared with the results of clustering methods to see if lwpi with only 10 parameters could confirm the results of data mining methods trained by means of numerous parameters i e 23 parameters here in this study 3 1 physicochemical and lwpi analysis the average results of physicochemical analyses of the samples including inflow and outflow from tabriz dumpsite were reported in tables 2 and 3 where the obtained results were compared to the who water quality standards who 2011 moreover the leachate sampling results are shown in table 4 the results of the detailed analyses for both dry and wet seasons at sampling points were tabulated in appendix see tables a1 and a2 it is noteworthy that the ph value of the leachate sample from tabriz dumpsite showed an alkaline nature indicating that the dumpsite could be classified as mature to old stage rana et al 2018 although the ph values for all groundwater samples are within the range of who standards who 2011 the inflow groundwater ph g1 was less than the values near the landfill g2 and g3 moreover in the far away outflows i e g4 and g5 the ph range was shown to be decrease due to distance from the landfill the observed ph in the surface water showed increasing trend so that the s1 sample as the inflow had value less than neutral but s2 sample despite being inflow as well showed an increase in ph value proportion to s1 such increase might be due to the existence of a chicken slaughterhouse before landfill which probably enters its wastewater illegally to the nearest surface water the sample s2 was taken from the surface water exactly in the vicinity of slaughterhouse where there were not any other pollution resource such as plants or even any kind of buildings moreover the samples s1 and s3 were taken from the locations before and after the slaughterhouse where the increased ph source in s2 is probably due to slaughterhouse furthermore in the history of the google earth map there is a probable pollution track of wastewater from slaughterhouse which drains to the komur river see fig 2 landfill leachate can affect groundwater ec by increasing the dissolved inorganic ions talalaj and biedka 2016 the ec value in the inflow groundwater has been increased compared to the outflows in both dry and wet seasons however the ec values in dry season are higher than that of the wet seasons this relates to the decrease of precipitation and increase of evapotranspiration so that the density of dissolved inorganic ions in groundwater increases chemical analysis of the heavy metals showed different metal concentrations in inflow and outflow of surface water and groundwater in this regard the concentrations of zn cr cu fe mn ni b ba and co in the outflow groundwater samples have been increased with respect to inflow concentration this result demonstrates the heavy metal pollution potential of landfill leachate the mechanism of heavy metal adsorption through the soil is deliberated by sangiumsak and punrattanasin 2014 in two phases first phase is heavy metals seep through the soil whereas a large amount is adsorbed by soil however in the second phase the adsorption rate decreases with time until almost an inability to adsorb comes some of the analyzed heavy metals i e pb cd as al hg mo sn v in the outflow groundwater samples did not exceed the inflow concentrations although their concentration was reportedly high in the leachate i e pb cd as this might be due to sorption of heavy metals on organic colloids and natural barrier performance of soil in the study area against some heavy metals awanm et al 2003 jiang et al 2010 the adsorption of metals from liquid phase into their solid phase is the dominant factor that controls the behaviors of heavy metals while passing through soil srivastava et al 2005 sangiumsak and punrattanasin 2014 for more information on adsorption of heavy metal ions on soils and influencing factors soils constituents and empirical and mechanistic adsorption models the readers are referred to the review paper by bradl 2004 the included heavy metals in lwpi measure are pb cu hg and cr where cr and cu showed increasing trend in groundwater due to leachate while pb and hg had constant concentrations the order of maximum heavy metal pollution which occurred at outflow groundwater with regard to inflow is as follows ba mn ni co fe cr cu b the change percent range for these heavy metals in outflow to inflow groundwater is 13 97 the minimum exceedance 13 increase relates to b concentration while the other metals have been increased more than 70 the landfill leachate is one of the anthropogenic sources that can lead to b exceedance in outflow groundwater voutsa et al 2009 taghipour et al 2012 the 96 increase of ba in the outflow groundwater can suggest not only the presence of landfill leachate but also industrial waste oil and gas contaminated fluid coal waste paints corrosion inhibitors and deicing products as well lagas et al 1984 since there is no industrial unit in the study area the only ba pollution source can be associated with landfill leachate that penetrate to the groundwater although mn and fe concentration in groundwater can be due to natural constituent of groundwater in this studied area spatial changes in mn and fe concentration and on the other hand the high concentration of mn and fe in tabriz dumpsite leachate demonstrate leachate based source for mn and fe el salam and abu zuid 2015 chidichimo et al 2020 moreover high concentration of ni co cr and cu in dumpsite leachate as well as increased concentration of mentioned metals in sample g4 delineate that the pollution source in groundwater is dumpsite leachate among the six heavy metals i e cr hg zn pb cd and cu involved in lwpi measure only cr and cu concentration in outflow has exceeded the inflow values although the concentration of zn pb cd in leachate was high but the attenuation process in soil did not lead to the penetration of these metals into groundwater the concentration of heavy metals in surface water at the sampling points including two inflows and one outflow has been increased in the following order ni cr ba zn mn fe al b cu however the higher concentration of the metals in bold type in the inflow groundwater was reported with respect to outflow which means that upstream water is already polluted by local pollution sources the effluent of chicken slaughterhouse which is located before the landfill i e between s1 and s2 might be the principal reason therefore in order to have precise judgment on how dumpsite leachate affects the surface water and the role of chicken slaughterhouse it is necessary to have numerous sampling through the river between s2 and s3 among the tested physiochemical elements halogens cl and br did not meet the standards of who water quality whereas in groundwater samples the elevated concentration of cl and br after landfill can elucidate landfill as the potential pollution sources in surface waters the amount of chlorine and bromine in all three sections of the river is higher than allowed limit and have increasing trend from s1 to s3 since there is not any industrial plants or pollution source in the nearby area it is resulted that the increasing trend of cl and br from s1 to s3 can be influenced by the chicken slaughterhouse wastewater this outcome is in agreements with various studies that consider cl and br as tracer elements which determine the elevated concentration of cl and br in surface and groundwater can serve as the indicators of water resources pollution due to unsanitary dumpsite goldberg and kabengi 2010 korom and seaman 2012 naveen et al 2018 chen et al 2019 according to review study of venkatesan and swaminathan 2009 near landfill sites cl concentration used to assess infiltrations of leachate plume from sanitary landfills into the groundwater soil water and river water near landfills in order to trace movement of contamination moreover it is noted that the concentrations of cl and br during the wet season reported more than dry season due to occurrence of more precipitation in this season which this conforms results of bech et al 2017 research where indicated that br concentration in soil water varies both spatially and temporally and is influenced by soil type and irrigation among several physicochemical parameters in tables 2 and 3 the toc and pah are indicators of dissolved organic matter in analyzed samples where the existence of these two parameters together in water can be the indicator of leachate leaking into that water talalaj 2014 the increasing trend of toc and pah in both surface water and groundwater proves the leachate penetration into the water bodies in the area the toc is often used as a nonspecific indicator of the water quality however several studies e g daou et al 2016 krčmar et al 2018 przydatek and kanownik 2019 conducted studies which indicated toc footprint in water resources surrounding the landfills due to leachate leakage to groundwater toc results from a decaying organic matter i e humic acid fulvic acid amines and urea and synthetic sources i e detergents pesticides fertilizers industrial chemicals and chlorinated organics that are found abundantly in leachate hendricks 2007 in the current study area toc in the outflow water samples ranged from 10 92 to 616 6 mg l while the concentration was higher in the outflow samples than inflow as can be seen in fig 3 toc amount in surface water samples and the groundwater sample g4 the most impacted well by leachate is increasing during both wet and dry seasons however zhao et al 2018 and nienie et al 2017 observed the decreasing trend of toc during dry season the reason beyond contrary results of current study with the mentioned previous studies lies on diverse situation of study areas in the current study the tabriz city dumpsite which is the major and somehow only reason of toc pollution in surrounding water resources is located outside the city s residential area without any industry plants therefore although during the dry season due to decrease of rainfall toc concentration is increased in seasonal komur river during the wet season of a semidry region like tabriz not only tangible difference in leachate dilution cannot be seen in samples but also due to increase of leachate generation because of rainfall increase the pollution potential of leachate is also increased however the study area in zhao et al 2018 is the lanzhou city where is a center for heavy industry and petrochemical industry therefore the toc amount can be elevated during precipitation which pollutions be washed out to the permanent and watery yellow river throughout all the industrial region so not only the landfill can effect on elevated toc results but also the industrial contaminations can do the study area at the research of nienie et al 2017 is the suburban areas of kikwit where the water samples were collected from three main wells and two rivers which drain the city of kikwit since these rivers are the main drainages used for domestic activities it is expected that the toc amount is increased during wet season because the rivers are fed with the organic matters i e humic acid fulvic acid amines and urea or detergents pesticides fertilizers industrial chemicals and chlorinated organics that can originate from residential places in addition to landfill leachate on the other hand the climate of the region soil material waste composition leachate pollution rate groundwater depth are effective factors in pollutants transfer pattern to groundwater talalaj 2014 indicated that the high values of toc and pah together in water quality analysis are the 1 s of pollution due to leachate the pahs are one of the most widespread organic pollutants the pah can be found in a coal tar bitumen crude oil and roofing tar they are also used for medicines dyes plastics and pesticides such as naphthalene found in mothballs the mean value of the pah in the outflow was higher than the inflow water during both seasons while the pah contamination during wet season was considerable than dry season this suggests the dumpsite as the pah pollution source due to the lack of waste separation and recycling burial overall the lwpi results in table 5 declare the increasing trend in surface water and groundwater when approaching the dumpsite according to talalaj 2014 the pollution range based on lwpi is divided into four categories if lwpi 1 there is no landfill leachate pollution impact on the sampled water 1 lwpi 2 there is moderately polluted water due to landfill leachate 2 lwpi 5 there is high visible landfill leachate impact on the sampled water and lwpi greater than 5 there is strongly polluted water under an evidently very high landfill leachate impact according to the pollution range division the surface water was highly polluted even at inflow however the leachate impact at outflow of the landfill was increased due to dumpsite effect in case of groundwater the lwpi values at sampling points before and after g4 were reported to be 2 but in sample g4 lwpi had been dramatically increased to above 30 fig 4 shows the figurative idea of the spatial distribution of the lwpi average in both seasons around the sampling points since ordinary kriging method suffers smoothing effect as the small observed values are usually overestimated and large values are underestimated idw method preferred herein to develop fig 4 idw method often performs better than other classic simple spatial interpolation techniques the reason lies behind the way it models spatial variability kriging and some other methods perform smoothing while modelling spatial variability whereas idw models it by fitting straight lines through the observations therefore the estimated values are more close to the observation and get decreased by the distance weights as the estimated locations get further away known as bull s eye effect where using denser observations can reduce this effect bronowicka mielniczuk et al 2019 however it should be noted that the observations likely come usually with errors that can be reduced by performing smoothing e g via kriging in spatial variability modelling so though idw performs better in case of satisfactory number of observations it s not necessarily superior when the observations include high level of error according to fig 4 sampling points near dumpsite i e s3 g4 show the maximum pollution rate although the temporal analysis of lwpi indicated that during wet season the rate of pollution was more than dry season the rate of spatial change in pollution rate in both seasons was similar this outcome confirms the results of other studies which assess seasonal variability of water quality by physicochemical parameters zhao et al 2018 nienie et al 2017 since the dumpsite has no surface water collection system the runoff originated from upstream flows toward dumpsite which is located in at the valleys of mountainous area so the run of easily enters the waste then the runoff not only infiltrates passes through the waste and descends into the soil but also in its rout pathway to downstream it is combined with leachate that is collected behind the leachate collection decks which is mentioned as wetlands before and then the polluted water flows through the hillside to reach komur river according to lwpi results in table 5 groundwater pollution is more severe than surface water pollution in the area while the surface water was polluted even before reaching the dumpsite surroundings although dumpsite leachate has increased the pollution rate the most polluted point is g4 sampling well located in the south east of the dumpsite near the s3 surface water sampling point see fig 4 g4 has been polluted due to leachate penetration in line with the land slope which is from the dumpsite toward well g4 in spite of higher variation of ground elevation between dumpsite located at a mountainous area and g4 well located near the komur river g4 well is impacted immensely by leachate that corresponds to quantity and quality of leachate and the sandy soil type of the region the reason for the s3 pollution is dependent on leachate and contaminated runoffs during precipitation which originated from highlands and passed through the dumpsite and end at komur river in order to study the polluted area in accordance to all analyzed physicochemical parameters two data mining methods i e pca and som were applied on several data during both seasons to determine the regions with similar water quality in this way by assessing the lwpi results and the locations with similar water quality obtained from pca and som the leachate impacted area could be interpreted 3 2 pca lwpi analyses in sampling points helped to understand the leachate polluted points and also the scale of surface water and groundwater deterioration caused by leachate however only 10 parameters among several physicochemical parameters of tables 2 and 3 were used to conceive the result of lwpi pca as a statistical technique used all physicochemical parameters of tables 2 and 3 to extract the most important ones in assessing variation of water quality in order to develop pca model matrix x with 18 rows and 23 columns were developed where lines of x correspond to variables in water sampling points at wet and dry seasons and columns to physicochemical measurements obtained from analysis of real samples data in tables 2 and 3 by decomposing the matrix x into a matrix product s l t t refers to transposed matrix pca produces orthogonal components where s denotes scores matrix and l is the loadings matrix that explains the responsible variables for patterns found in scores matrix cordella et al 2012 in order to accomplish pca on data matrix x first standardization with mean centering of each variable and dividing the resulting values by standard deviation was performed according to the criteria of eigenvalue one five pcs were identified to explain 89 3 of the total variance of the dataset in which the first pc with 42 9 of variance indicated all the wells despite the most polluted i e g4 and inflow i e g1 wells it could be indicated by the strong positive loadings on the g2 g3 g5 and g6 variables in table 6 the second pc with 21 5 of variance indicated surface water inflow samples i e s1 s2 the third pc with 10 9 of variance indicated inflow well i e g1 and utmost outflow wells i e g5 g6 which can be considered as unpolluted wells pc4 with 8 9 of variance had significant loadings on g4 and s3 which indicated the most polluted points including surface water and groundwater i e g4 and s3 the fifth pc with 5 4 of variance suggests the important loadings related to observatory surface water sample i e s1 indeed according to table 6 spatial analysis based on water quality of the region was performed and five distinct groups according to water quality of the sampling points were distinguished pca clustered samples according to water quality characteristics of surface water and groundwater into unpolluted semi polluted and polluted locations impacted by leachate the ability of pca as a multivariate statistical method to analyze attributes of physicochemical data and determine the significant independent variables was shown in fig 5 by pc plots of dominant components for loadings and scores which respectively depict the contribution of dominant physicochemical parameters in different components and the potential spatiotemporal discrimination of samples by assessing the precipitation series in wet and dry seasons according to fig 5 loadings of the first component pc1 can be characterized by mineral parameters ec total hardness tds ca mg na k and cl accordingly the scores of the pc1 revels the dominancy of surface water sampling points s1 s2 and s3 during dry season where decrease of rainfall is observed in precipitation series see fig 5 this increase could be explained by a certain concentration effect of mineral and anthropogenic parameters due to less precipitations and higher temperatures when approaching the dry season in the study area the second component pc2 fig 5 principally represents organic character comprising higher loadings for toc no3 and pah which corresponds to landfill leachate according to the scores plot of pc2 the most polluted well due to organic pollution is g4 in both dry and wet seasons where was selected as the most impacted well based on lwpi as well although at the first glance it seems that the concentration of leachate can be reduced in the wet season due to rainfall increase and the decrease of pollution concentration the pollution range in g4 at both seasons dominated equally the reason could rely on the fact that maximum pollution was occurred in groundwater sample and not in surface water whereas in such a dry region even at wet season the precipitation amount is low see the precipitation time series in fig 5 so the decrease of pollution concentration due to increase in rainfall might not be so tangible on the other hand the studied landfill is unsanitary without proper coverage where increase of the rainfall has elevated the production of leachate so the concentration of pollution did not decline during wet season however according to pc3 scores the increase of surface water pollution in surface water samples at s3 is observed according to the loadings of pc3 organic parameters are dominant as the elevated weight of cod shows the existence of non biodegradable organics also high levels of toc no2 nh3 and pah are indicators of the organic pollution especially for sampling point s3 which among the surface water samples is the nearest sampling point to the landfill the high scores of s3 in both dry and wet seasons demonstrate the maximum organic pollution concentration due to the landfill leachate looking at the scores on the pc3 fig 5 an increasing trend can be noticed on surface water samples at wet season where the scores are increasing when going down from upstream to downstream this evolution could be clearly highlighted by the scores corresponding to the punctual environmental violation like an illegal wastewater discharge from chicken slaughter house occurring before s2 and landfill leachate discharge from unsanitary landfill near s3 3 3 self organizing map analysis som as a nonlinear ann based clustering technique was used to spatially classify the physicochemical properties of sampling points during two seasons the total number of neurons in som was determined based on the formula suggested by vesanto 2000 5 n 21 where n is the number of samples afterwards among various combinations of map dimension the appropriate map size was set to 7 3 according to quantization error qe and topographic error te criteria garcıa and gonzalez 2004 once the map size of som had been determined the weight distance matrix or u matrix and input planes were visualized in fig 6 the input planes which were named with physicochemical parameters in fig 6 show weight planes for each element of the input vector they are visualizations of the weights that connect each input to each of the neurons darker colors represent larger weights if the connection patterns of two inputs are very similar it can be assumed that the inputs are highly correlated in this study the input planes of ec total hardness tds ca2 na and cl are similar and consequently these parameters are correlated total alkalinity and hco3 also demonstrate identical planes overall the input planes of som is an appropriate tool to assess the interrelationship of the different water quality parameters in the clustering the plot in the last column of fig 6 which was named som weight neighbor distances shows u matrix where the small hexagons represent the neurons and the large ones visualize the distances between neurons and show connection to neighbor neurons by the lines in the large hexagons of the u matrix the darker colors represent larger distances and the lighter colors represent smaller distances one of the advantages of u matrix maps is the ease of extracting clustering with visual judgment of maps before assessing the obtained analytical results so this visualization ability distinguishes som from other clustering methods like pca according to dotted polygons on som neighbor weight distance plot fig 6 which obtained from visualization of authors there might be four clusters in this way two clusters can be assumed at the lower part of the som neighbor weight distance plot by following a band of dark segments crosses from the right bottom corner to the mid left region the other cluster can be the vertical dark band at the upper part of the figure which is separated from lighter colored region in the upper left the final cluster can be depicted in the upper right side of the map with lighter colors therefore based on visual understanding of the authors four clusters were imagined however in order to precisely determine the optimal number of the clusters k means algorithm with davies bouldin clustering index was used garcía and gonzález 2004 davies bouldin clustering index minimizes within clusters distance and maximizes between clusters distance so in accordance with k means which yields low values it indicates good clustering results for spherical clusters garcía and gonzález 2004 according to fig 7 the optimal clustering number corresponds to 5 clusters whereas the davies bouldin clustering index is minimized once the optimum clustering number has been selected the position of five distinct clusters were drawn in fig 8 according to som clustering results determined via davies bouldin clustering index which are tabulated in table 7 the comparison of figs 6 and 8 indicates the similarity between visual and analytical result of som based clustering where unless clusters one and three which were assumed identical all the assumptions came right this is the superiority of som visualization maps which extract nonlinear relations in 2 d map and lead to fast judgment before spending time on analytical consequences according to table 7 the first cluster identifies surface water at inflow in both seasons i e s1 and s2 in dry season the second cluster presents the most polluted well in wet and dry seasons i e g4 the third cluster shows the most polluted surface water sample s3 in dry and wet seasons in addition to s3 as the polluted surface water at the outflow of dumpsite s2 sample in the wet season due to high range of pollution in water quality because of chicken slaughterhouse was also grouped in the third cluster the fourth cluster displays the inflow groundwater samples in both seasons i e g1 g2 and g3 the last cluster includes the groundwater samples at the outflow of dumpsite which are fairly far from the dumpsite in this way som spatially clustered the samples according to their polluting potential 3 4 comparison of the lwpi pca and som outcomes owing to the results of som and pca clustering it is inferred that both models had similar performance in grouping data whereas the outcomes led to determination of regions with low moderate and high potential of water quality deterioration evaluation of lwpi results also determined the spatial pollution range due to leachate in the study area the comparison of clustering results and lwpi led to identical consequence in spatial analysis of water quality therefore in similar cases it would be profitable timesaving and efficient to use lwpi with only 10 parameters instead of complicated clustering methods which were implemented based on several physicochemical parameters according to tables 6 and 7 pca and som classified s3 and g4 separately from the other data which according to table 5 and lwpi results demonstrated the most polluted points the considerable difference between som and pca methods was grouping s3 and g4 samples together in pca and separated in som however som clustering pattern seems to be more efficient than pca because the polluted surface water and groundwater could be clustered separately which relates to nonlinear entity of som that can differentiate pollution in surface water and groundwater because the water pollution in the surface water occurs due to leachate flow to the river but groundwater is polluted due to leachate penetration through layers of soil where attenuation can change pollution order and type leachate as a highly polluted wastewater contains a wide range of contaminants including organic and inorganic matters humic and fulvic substances and even heavy metals during passing of leachate into groundwater the soil constituent naturally transforms contaminants to less harmful forms or immobilize contaminants so that they have less threats to the environment different mechanisms have influence on the transport of pollutants from soil layers to groundwater e g diffusion adsorption precipitation and decay therefore the nature of the pollutants except trace elements change while passing through the soil layers for example soil microorganisms play important roles in nitrogen cycling within the soil which can derive nitrification or denitrification therefore removal of nitrogen out of the leachate in soil occurs that leads to biological water purification however in case of surface water the leachate flow is over the surface without passing soil layers which can effect on pollutant characteristics the extraction of dominant physicochemical parameters by means of pca and som methods approved the efficiency of similar parameters used in lwpi in this way according to fig 5 the dominant parameters based on loadings in pc1 were ec total hardness tds ca2 na k and cl while in fig 6 these parameters denoted the similar pattern in input plans the spatial clustering outcomes of these parameters in both pca and som denoted to surface water as inflow specifically in dry season where natural mineral parameters are responsible as the dominant parameters assessing table 1 revealed ec as the important parameter for lwpi which is admitted by pca component1 and som cluster 1 dominants in the pc 2 fig 5 toc in the first rank and pah no3 in the second rank are the most dominant parameters however based on input plans fig 6 toc no3 and pah show similar pattern albeit pah weights are a bit less evaluation of lwpi parameters discloses pah and toc as the important parameters that play crucial role in leachate pollution the spatial analysis of pca component 2 and som cluster 2 denoted g4 as the most impacted sampling site according toc no3 and pah finally in pc3 of pca fig 5 cod toc no2 nh3 and pah are reported as the effective loadings whereas in fig 6 parameters no2 nh3 show identical input plan as cod toc and somehow pah shows in the corresponding component and cluster the s3 sampling point is presented overall the comparison of results obtained via lwpi pca and som methods verified that lwpi can be a valid cost effective and time saving alternative to pca and som which can be moved onto other sites becoming an outcome of broad applicability 4 conclusion since the water resources i e surface water and groundwater in the region are subjected to leachate pollution in an effort the scale of the surface water and groundwater pollution due to the generated leachate since 20 years ago was investigated however water pollution assessment needs the interpretation of numerous water quality data with complex and non linear relationship between data so pca and som were used to discover the complex relationship among surface water and groundwater data lwpi measure with only ten physicochemical parameters was used to quickly and effectively streamline the numerous data and discern pollution rate with spatially and temporally water quality analysis data in this regard pca and som tools were applied to evaluate lwpi measure efficiency the summary of achieved results was categorized as follow the physicochemical water quality parameters which exceeded the permitted limits indicate that there is contamination in the water resources of the region due to leakage of leachate to groundwater and surface water the lwpi as an indicator to determine water pollution with the source of landfill leachate revealed that tabriz city dumpsite had the most negative impact on the surface water and groundwater at s3 and g4 sampling points the temporal evaluation of water pollution indicated that during the wet season the lwpi values were higher than dry season because precipitation and runoff transport contaminations pca and som applied to cluster numerous physicochemical and heavy metal parameters in various sampling points and in diverse seasons pca showed that 5 components account for 89 3 of total variance for the surface water and groundwater pollution the som clustering method also identified five clusters where the spatial water pollution was determined it was confirmed that both pca and som methods function efficiently with similar outcomes in characterizing sampling points as low moderate and high polluted regions although pca demonstrated proper capability in handling multivariable data set som due to nonlinear entity could detect the complex properties of analyzed data more precisely as such som could cluster s3 as the most polluted surface water and g4 as the most polluted groundwater separately the practical implication of this work was evaluating the efficiency of lwpi in determining the contaminated water resources due to landfill leachate with less water quality parameters analysis which is more cost effective whereas the efficiency of lwpi was verified via pca and som with plenty of water quality parameters finally due to poor condition of the surface water and groundwater in the surrounding area of tabriz city dump site the immediate remediation policies to purify the water is required furthermore solid waste management as well as providing several engineered landfill cells to prevent water resources pollution in the region is the vital issue declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

5108,subsurface displacement can be a sign of shallow or deep seated landslides although forested headwaters feature primarily active hydrological responses and erosional responses the impacts of invisible subsurface displacement on hydrological responses are rarely reported this study presents the changes in hydrological responses before and after subsurface displacement in a natural forested headwater using event based analyses the maximum values of rainfall pore water pressure at the soil bedrock interface and surface runoff during rainfall events over 2 years were used to evaluate the changes in peak responses after subsurface displacement the results showed that subsurface displacement increased the maximum pore water pressure but reduced the rate of increase in pore water pressure particularly for the measurement points where perennial subsurface saturation existed peak runoff was produced with at least two sources of near surface flow and subsurface flow subsurface displacement reduced both the level and rate of increase in peak runoff the internal relations in pore water pressure and the correlations between pore water pressure and runoff weakened after displacement this weakening was likely due to displacement induced cracks facilitating rainwater percolation into bedrock layers and thereby decreasing the linkage between subsurface saturation and surface runoff subsurface displacement also modified the response time such that the maximum responses in pore water pressure and runoff tended to occur earlier than maximum rainfall during the period after displacement this study demonstrates that invisible subsurface displacement directly changes hydrological behaviors and that a headwater area is active sensitive and prone to disturbance even if it is covered by forest keywords hydraulic contribution area headwater pore water pressure rainfall runoff subsurface displacement 1 introduction hydrological behavior may differ among landforms or hillslope units kim et al 2007 fujimoto et al 2011 liang et al 2017 with headwaters generally featuring active hydrological and erosional responses tsukamoto and ohta 1988 gomi et al 2002 reported that headwater systems in forested areas characterized by interactions among hydrological geomorphic and biological processes show greater temporal and spatial variation and proposed that headwater systems require different protection strategies from those based on land use disturbance in forested headwaters is mainly related to extreme meteorological events vegetation conditions and mass movements heavy rainfall associated with a typhoon is one example of an extreme meteorological event that can seriously affect a mountain landscape in east asia huang et al 2012 disturbing forest ecosystems and their dynamics lin et al 2011 changes in vegetation due to forest succession natural disasters or timber harvesting can change rainfall redistribution processes and water balance iida et al 2005 liang 2020b tanaka et al 2008 according to results obtained using the paired watershed approach increases in water yield that accompany forest vegetation removal are highly variable among individual watershed sites tamai et al 2020 mass movements including landslides debris flow and hillslope failures induced by rainfall cause strong and instantaneous disturbance events in forested watersheds montgomery et al 2009 tsou et al 2011 lin and liang 2018 compared to these obvious disturbances the impacts of invisible mass movement such as subsurface displacement on hydrological responses are rarely reported and poorly understood subsurface displacement can be a sign of a debris slide shallow failure or deep seated landslide chigira 1992 sasaki et al 2000 liang 2020a iverson et al 2000 conducted experiments using artificial rainfall on flumes to demonstrate that repeated slip episodes could be induced by gradually increasing pore water pressure and arrested by pore dilation and the associated decrease in pore water pressure okura et al 2002 demonstrated three stages of landslide fluidization compaction of the soil layer by the sliding mass generation of excess pore water pressure and induction of fast shearing they also noted that the increase in pore water pressure near the slip surface is limited and does not exceed the soil layer thickness harp et al 1990 performed three experiments on natural slopes to investigate variation in soil pore water pressure during slope failures induced by subsurface irrigation through trenches in the upslope area their piezometer records showed a consistent trend of increasing pressure during the early stages of infiltration followed by abruptly decreasing pressure 5 50 min before slope failure these results suggest that the dramatic drops in pore water pressure prior to failure as well as dilation and failure itself may be due to piping through fine grained soil particles mirus et al 2017 and uhlemann et al 2017 monitored episodically recurring or slow moving landslides and both studies revealed that subsurface moisture dynamics or drainage patterns changed after landslides these cases suggest that increasing pore water pressure facilitates subsurface displacement and simultaneously that subsurface displacement would change subsurface hydrological behavior however few studies have reported the relationship between subsurface displacement dynamics and runoff responses at large scales in a previous study at a site in a forested headwater liang and chan 2017 we monitored the spatial and temporal variation in pore water pressure at the soil bedrock interface the expansion patterns of subsurface saturation during storm events could be classified into four stages initial fragmentary and unconnected distributions simultaneous downward and upward expansion of saturation with increased rainwater supply interconnection of saturation from upslope to downslope areas around the peak of rainfall and finally disappearance of saturation from the middle slope area during the drying process that study also demonstrated effects of soil depth and the topographic wetness index on spatial and temporal variation in subsurface saturation liang 2020a recorded the dynamics of pore water pressure at the soil bedrock interface during a shallow landslide induced by a typhoon event the dominant factors triggering the landslide were record high pore water pressure wet initial conditions and a heterogeneous distribution of subsurface saturation that study also found that previous subsurface displacement reduced slope stability and facilitated the landslide however the author primarily analyzed the changes in subsurface saturation after subsurface displacement the main objective of this study was to further examine the influences of subsurface displacement on hydrological responses in a steep naturally forested headwater catchment using the same dataset collected over 2 years and reported by liang 2020a the maximum values of rainfall pore water pressure at the soil bedrock interface and surface runoff during rainfall events were used to evaluate differences in the hydrological responses the maximum values lag times and their correlations were compared between periods before and after subsurface displacement 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and site the study area was in a natural forest at the fushan research center of the forestry research institute 24 45 42 n 121 35 45 e located in yilan county northeastern taiwan fig 1 a the average annual air temperature is 18 5 c in this area with a humid subtropical climate and average annual rainfall of 4125 mm rainfall is distributed throughout the year without significant dry or wet periods intense rainfall during the summer is caused by typhoons and showers whereas frequent rainfall in winter is due to northeast monsoons the land cover is characterized as a moist subtropical mixed evergreen forest soils in the area are classified in the yellow colluvial and lithosol groups and the bedrock consists of argillite shale and slate a hydrological observation site was established in a small headwater catchment which was located upstream of an erosion gully alongside tsukeng stream fig 1a trees and understory vegetation were evenly distributed throughout the site except in the two small gullies fig 1b surface runoff originated from two small gullies and occurred year round surface topography and the spatial distribution of soil depth were measured using a laser rangefinder and a knocking type cone penetrometer respectively bedrock topography i e the soil bedrock interface was determined from surface topography and the spatial distribution of soil depth the mean slope gradient of the site was 41 range 4 75 the spatial distribution of soil depth was highly variable ranging from 0 4 to 7 0 m with a mean of 2 4 m other details of environmental factors and the measurement of surface topography soil depth and bedrock topography have been described in previous studies liang et al 2014 2017 liang and chan 2017 liang 2020a 2 2 monitoring of rainfall pore water pressure and runoff total rainfall was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge 7852 m davis and automatically recorded using a data logger ua 003 64 onset in an open area approximately 800 m from the observation site a monitoring area of 0 10 ha with a length of 43 m and width of 33 m was established in the valley head area of the observation site to measure pore water pressure at the soil bedrock interface fig 1b sixty hand built tensiometers were installed at the soil bedrock interface at the points where penetration tests had been performed each tensiometer consisted of a pressure transducer pa 750 copal electronics a polyvinyl chloride pvc probe body and a porous ceramic cup pore water pressure was recorded with two data loggers cr1000 campbell scientific other details on the size measurement resolution and setting of tensiometers were provided by liang and chan 2017 surface runoff in a small gully was monitored with a 30 v notch weir fig 1b two pressure sensors with built in data loggers baro diver schlumberger were set in the weir and outside of the weir to record hydrostatic pressure and atmospheric pressure respectively the water level in the weir was calculated based on the difference between values recorded by the two sensors the water levels cm were converted into instantaneous water amounts ml s based on field calibration conducted monthly hydrological measurements were collected at 10 min intervals over more than 2 years from december 2013 to september 2016 hydrological measurements were not available after september 27 2016 due to a typhoon that caused a landslide across the observation site liang 2020a 2 3 subsurface displacement and data analyses a typhoon event began on august 6 with a total rainfall amount of 370 mm and duration of 46 3 h which makes it the second largest typhoon event of 2015 this event caused surface cracks hillslope collapses gully expansions and huge streambed fluctuations in the study area lin and liang 2018 the surface environment of the observation site was not markedly damaged except for some wind fallen branches or trees after the event however some tensiometers lost water and could not be refilled fig 1b during replacement of the tensiometers the porous cups were broken and the pvc probes were bent at the tip fig 1c this damage likely resulted from shear forces caused by subsurface displacement around the soil bedrock interface thus the displacement did not markedly affect the surface environment but did impact the subsurface environment the hydrological dataset was divided into two periods before december 6 2013 to august 8 2015 and after august 8 2015 to september 19 2016 the typhoon event that caused subsurface displacement fig 2 using a heuristic event separation method wiekenkamp et al 2016 other individual rainfall events were separated based on a threshold of 2 mm accumulated rainfall over 18 consecutive hours the validity of rainfall event separation was tested in a previous study liang and chan 2017 individual rainfall events with more than 5 missing data out of 60 total tensiometer measurement points at the start peak rainfall or end of an event were excluded from subsequent analyses during the analyzed rainfall events the maximum values of rainfall pore water pressure and runoff properties were used to examine their responses as well as correlations with hillslope hydrological reactions before and after subsurface displacement table 1 fig 3 shows selected values from hydrological dataset recorded during the event that caused subsurface displacement among rainfall properties the maximum rainfall intensity ri accumulated rainfall amount at ri ra and antecedent rainfall amount in 7 days prior to the time of ri rt were used to describe the greatest inputs during each event fig 3 table 1 ri was derived from the maximum rainfall amount observed at 10 min intervals and ra was calculated from the start of an event to the time of ri rt was calculated based on the following equation which has been adopted for the public disaster warning system in taiwan chen and fujita 2013 1 r t i 0 7 α i r i where i is days ri is the amount of rainfall for the antecedent i days α is a weighting factor and rt is the sum of the unadjusted rainfall amount on day 0 and the rainfall amounts in the antecedent 7 days adjusted using α the value of α was set to 0 7 which has been the official value in taiwan since 2014 chen et al 2017 the variable rt represents serial data that can be calculated at any time point fig 2 and rt represents the rt value at the time of ri to assess the properties of pore water pressure 60 measurement points were classified into four frequencies of saturation generation i e pore water pressure 0 the saturation generation frequency at each measurement point was determined using eq 2 as detailed in a previous study liang and chan 2017 2 always μ 0 cm and μ σ 0 cm usually μ 0 cm and μ σ 0 cm sometimes μ 0 cm and μ σ 0 cm rarely μ 0 cm and μ σ 0 cm where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the continuous time series of pore water pressure according to liang and chan 2017 prior to displacement saturation frequencies of always usually sometimes and rarely were observed at 11 3 22 and 24 points among 60 total points respectively fig 1b the mean pore water pressure for each saturation generation frequency is shown in fig 2 the maximum values of mean pore water pressure at all of 60 measurement points pall and at points with saturation frequencies of always usually sometimes and rarely i e palways pusually psometimes and prarely were used to describe the strongest responses of pore water pressure during each rainfall event fig 3 table 1 furthermore the dataset of bedrock topography and pore water pressure was used to evaluate the hydraulic contribution area hydraulic head was calculated at each of 60 measurement points as the sum of pore water pressure plus the elevation of bedrock a grid based map at a 2 m interval i e the mesh shown in fig 1b of hydraulic head was produced at each time point using the ordinary kriging method surfer ver 13 golden software the d infinity approach of tarboton 1997 was used to detect the flow direction and calculate the upslope contribution area for each grid this calculation was based on the assumption that the hydraulic head based plane controls subsurface water flow or surface runoff if percolation into the bedrock is minor the hydraulic contribution area in the grid nearest the origin of surface runoff was selected as the evaluation point fig 1b and the maximum ratio of the hydraulic contribution area at the evaluation point to the total grid area of the site ca was used as another index to evaluate the relationship between pore water pressure and runoff responses the maximum intensity of runoff frunoff during an event was used to describe the peak flow fig 3 table 1 the lag times among the maximum hydrological properties in rainfall pore water pressure and runoff table 1 were calculated i e time of runoff time of pore water pressure time of runoff time of rainfall and time of pore water pressure time of rainfall the order of response times was based on the assumed process of rainwater infiltrating toward the soil bedrock boundary and then flowing out as surface runoff which is synonymous with the variable source area concept hewlett and hibbert 1967 and fill and spill concept spence and woo 2003 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 thus positive and negative lag times refer to cases following these assumptions and not following them respectively moreover the correlations among all indices were evaluated using spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs during the periods before and after subsurface displacement the significance of rs was determined with a threshold of p value 0 05 3 results 3 1 maximum responses of pore water pressure and runoff to rainfall the numbers of rainfall events used for analyses before and after subsurface displacement were 89 and 65 respectively fig 2 when determining the relationship between ri and ra fig 4 a ra after displacement was slightly less than ra before displacement at ri 5 mm 10 min in the relationship between ri and rt fig 4b in contrast rt after displacement was slightly greater than rt before displacement at ri 13 mm 10 min comparing ra to rt fig 4c rt after displacement was slightly greater than rt before displacement at ra 100 mm although the variation in the relationships among ri ra and rt grew during the period after displacement according to the r2 values of regression lines the maximum rainfall properties showed slight changes between observations before and after displacement the relationships between ri and pore water pressure in terms of pall palways pusually psometimes and prarely were weak fig 5 a although all categories of pore water pressure showed high values after displacement their trend lines expressed as exponential regressions had very low coefficients of determination and lacked statistical significance the fitting was improved in the relationships between ra and pore water pressure fig 5b and palways increased markedly after displacement the relationships between rt and pore water pressure were best represented by exponential regressions with three rainfall properties fig 5c pore water pressure showed threshold responses relative to ra or rt and had greater values after displacement fig 5b and c pore water pressure increased with ra or rt when its value was 50 mm but plateaued at values greater than 50 mm greater pore water pressure after displacement was observed for each category of pore water pressure and in particular palways showed large values after displacement focusing on the difference between low and high values of palways the increment after displacement was smaller than that before displacement this indicates that the total level of saturation increased but the rate of increase in saturation decreased after displacement fig 6 shows the lag time between maximum rainfall and pore water pressure sorted by ri ra and rt the lag time was calculated as the time of pall or palways prarely minus the time of ri as the same time point as ra and rt the absolute values of lag time decreased with increases in ri ra or rt with quite similar patterns among all categories of pore water pressure after displacement the mean value lag time shifted from positive to negative and the standard deviation became large these results suggest that the maximum pore water pressure response occurred earlier and varied more after displacement the relationships between ri and frunoff did not significantly differ between observations before and after displacement but the total amount and rate of increase in frunoff after displacement were markedly lower than those before displacement when evaluated using ra or rt fig 7 a this finding indicates that ri contributed equally to frunoff in both periods but the contributions of ri or rt on frunoff weakened after displacement the lag time between maximum rainfall and runoff was calculated as the time of frunoff minus the time of ri fig 7b the absolute value of lag time decreased with increases in ri ra or rt and the lag time values converged with increasing ri the mean value lag time became negative and the standard deviation grew large after displacement suggesting larger variation in lag time after displacement 3 2 maximum response of runoff to pore water pressure maximum pore water pressure and frunoff showed threshold relationships with frunoff values remaining low in the zone of negative pore water pressure and increasing greatly in the zone of positive pore water pressure fig 8 a this tendency was generally consistent between the periods before and after displacement except for palways which lacked negative pore water pressure values and was larger after displacement the fitting magnitude of exponential regressions was lower after displacement indicating greater variation in the relationships between maximum pore water pressure and frunoff after displacement the lag time between maximum pore water pressure and runoff was calculated as the time of frunoff minus the time of pall or palways prarely fig 8b larger variation in lag time was found in the zone where frunoff greatly increased although the standard deviation of lag time was large the mean lag time was generally negative between frunoff and pall or palways prarely during both periods this indicates that the peak of runoff likely occurred earlier than the maximum pore water pressure frunoff appeared to increase with carea prior to displacement but was not related to carea after displacement fig 9 a carea ranged from 7 1 to 11 8 with a mean of 9 2 for events before displacement and from 7 4 to 10 6 with a mean of 8 7 for events after displacement these results indicate that carea decreased slightly after displacement the lag time between carea and frunoff was calculated as the time of frunoff minus the time of carea fig 9b lag time did not show an obvious trend with carea and had large standard deviations during both periods the mean lag time was positive before displacement and became negative after displacement indicating that the peak of runoff occurred later than carea before displacement but earlier than carea after displacement 3 3 correlations among maximum responses in rainfall pore water pressure and runoff before and after subsurface displacement fig 10 shows correlations among the properties of maximum rainfall pore water pressure and runoff values before and after subsurface displacement which were evaluated using spearman s rank correlation coefficient for the relationships between rainfall and pore water pressure maximum pore water pressure was most strongly correlated with rt and secondarily by ra and ri which changed slightly between measurements before and after displacement this finding suggested that maximum pore water pressure was more influenced by antecedent rainfall or accumulated rainfall rather than immediate rainfall among pore water pressure values pall and its components of palways pusually psometimes and prarely showed very high correlations before displacement however the correlations among pore water pressure levels weakened after displacement suggesting that subsurface displacement directly affected the linkages among pore water pressure levels as represented by the four saturation generation frequencies carea was the worst index linked to pore water pressure or runoff and lacked statistical significance for some cases in both periods frunoff appeared to be related to rt ra and ri at equivalent levels which changed little between measurements taken before and after displacement this finding suggests that antecedent rainfall accumulated rainfall and immediate rainfall might have all contributed to peak runoff frunoff was associated with pall and its components however the correlations of frunoff with palways and pusually were low after displacement suggesting that subsurface displacement may have weakened the linkage between subsurface saturation and runoff fig 11 summarizes the lag time of indices of pore water pressure hydraulic contribution area and runoff from maximum rainfall the median or mean values of most indices were recorded later than the time of maximum rainfall before displacement but most were earlier than maximum rainfall after displacement this finding suggests that subsurface displacement directly altered the response time of pore water pressure and runoff 4 discussion the observed changes in the responses of pore water pressure and runoff before and after displacement may have been due to differences in rainfall inputs between the two periods or to the effects of subsurface displacement among three indices of rainfall characteristics rt was slightly greater after displacement relative to an equivalent value of ri or ra fig 4b and c and had the strongest correlations with indices of pore water pressure and runoff fig 10 those results indicate that events after displacement featured greater rainfall amounts in the antecedent 7 days and the headwater may have been wetter at the beginning of rainfall events after displacement based on higher rt values both pore water pressure and runoff should increase with greater rainfall supply during the period after displacement however this inference is inconsistent with the observation results as pall slightly increased fig 5c and frunoff fig 7a markedly decreased after displacement thus changes in hydrological responses between the two periods result mainly from subsurface displacement rather than from differences in rainfall characteristics 4 1 influences of subsurface displacement on the response of pore water pressure subsurface displacement increased the maximum values of pore water pressure reduced the rate of increase in pore water pressure at measurement points with perennial saturation i e palways fig 5 and weakened the correlations among sites for the four saturation generation frequencies fig 10 one possible reason for these results could be that subsurface displacement produced fissures or cracks around the soil bedrock interface or within bedrock layers such displacement induced cracks could serve as preferential pathways facilitating deeper percolation krzeminska et al 2014 sidle and bogaard 2016 uhlemann et al 2017 although longer persistence of positive pore water pressure and slower drainage was also observed at a hillslope with episodic slides compared to a vegetated hillslope mirus et al 2017 in the present study displacement induced cracks likely decreased the linkages in saturation at the soil bedrock interface and the hydraulic plane and thereby facilitated rainwater percolation into bedrock layers along the cracks this inference is supported by the evidence given in fig 12 which shows the spatial distributions of mean pore water pressure and mean ratio of hydraulic contribution area during events before and after displacement using all time series data collected during rainfall events fig 2 these mean values were calculated at each pore water pressure measurement point fig 12a and for each grid based on the ratio of hydraulic contribution area to all total area of the grid fig 12b as indicated by the dashed circles expanded and newly formed saturated zones were found in the middle and downslope areas of the site after displacement the connectivity of the hydraulic contribution area was interrupted in the middle of the site after displacement the locations that showed major changes after displacement were surrounded by detection points with broken tensiometers representing potential points of subsurface displacement this finding suggests that subsurface displacement alters the flow paths and shifted subsurface flow toward deeper locations or downslope points this process caused the groundwater table to rise but limited the rate of increase in palways due to increased loss of rainwater to recharge groundwater the displacement induced cracks also caused faster response times of maximum pore water pressure for pall and its components after displacement fig 11 this change is likely due to the rate of increase in pore water pressure being limited after displacement causing pore water pressure to reach its maximum earlier relative to events before displacement 4 2 influences of subsurface displacement on the runoff generation process the influences of subsurface displacement on the generation processes of runoff were complex because runoff generation processes were associated with both rainfall inputs and contributions from subsurface flow or groundwater the contribution of peak rainfall on peak runoff did not differ between events before and after displacement but the contributions of antecedent rainfall and accumulated rainfall on peak runoff weakened after displacement fig 7a this suggests that peak runoff was produced by at least two sources near surface flow and subsurface flow or groundwater which were associated with peak rainfall and antecedent accumulated rainfall respectively thus subsurface displacement reduced both the amount and rate of increase in peak runoff in the component related to antecedent accumulated rainfall as well as that associated with rainwater percolating through subsurface or bedrock layers more subsurface saturation was required after displacement i e palways in fig 8a to produce peak runoff equivalent to that before displacement the correlations between the properties of maximum pore water pressure and peak runoff weakened after displacement fig 10 thus subsurface displacement also affected the linkage between pore water pressure and runoff one process assumed to generate runoff is rainwater infiltrating toward the soil bedrock boundary and then flowing out as surface runoff however this assumption contradicts the observations at this study site because the response time of maximum pore water pressure was later than the time of peak runoff figs 8b and 11 in addition the assumption that the hydraulic head based plane controls subsurface water flow or surface runoff was not supported at this site fig 9a the generation of subsurface saturation at the soil bedrock interface was driven by both exfiltrated groundwater and excess perched water at the study site liang and chan 2017 notably the soil bedrock interface at the study site was not impermeable during both periods subsurface flow mainly occurred along a specific pathway e g fig 12b rather than expanding over the bedrock surface based on the findings described above the variable source area concept hewlett and hibbert 1967 mcdonnell 2009 and fill and spill concept spence and woo 2003 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 could not be validated at the study site as these concepts are based on the condition of an impermeable bedrock surface similarly analyses techniques based on topographic features such as topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 are not appropriate for application at this study site in future studies a new concept or model must be developed to describe a headwater subsurface environment with abundant cracks prone to displacement and with least two sources of subsurface saturation e g downward infiltration of water lateral movement of perched water or upward increasing of groundwater 5 conclusion we studied the changes in hydrological responses between observations before and after subsurface displacement in a natural forested headwater these observations represent a rare case wherein invisible subsurface displacement directly affected hydrological behaviors the main changes after displacement can be summarized as follows 1 the maximum values of pore water pressure increased but the rate of increase in pore water pressure declined this tendency was obvious at the measurement points with perennial saturation 2 the correlations among sites in the frequency of subsurface saturation generation weakened this change is likely due to displacement induced cracks that reduced the linkages of saturation at the soil bedrock interface and facilitated rainwater percolation into bedrock layers 3 both the level and increment of peak runoff declined peak runoff was produced by at least two sources near surface flow and subsurface flow or groundwater which were associated with peak rainfall and antecedent accumulated rainfall respectively 4 in the period before displacement the maximum responses in pore water pressure and runoff tended to occur later than maximum rainfall however these responses came earlier than maximum rainfall during the period after displacement subsurface displacement also changed the response times of pore water pressure and runoff although subsurface displacement did not obviously damage the surface environment disturbance of subsurface environment had implications for the responses and linkages of pore water pressure at the soil bedrock interface and surface runoff headwater areas are active sensitive and prone to disturbance even those covered with forest in future studies it is essential to elucidate the hydrogeological mechanisms at work in forested headwaters in particular for those with abundant cracks that are prone to displacement and have least two sources of subsurface saturation declaration of

5108,subsurface displacement can be a sign of shallow or deep seated landslides although forested headwaters feature primarily active hydrological responses and erosional responses the impacts of invisible subsurface displacement on hydrological responses are rarely reported this study presents the changes in hydrological responses before and after subsurface displacement in a natural forested headwater using event based analyses the maximum values of rainfall pore water pressure at the soil bedrock interface and surface runoff during rainfall events over 2 years were used to evaluate the changes in peak responses after subsurface displacement the results showed that subsurface displacement increased the maximum pore water pressure but reduced the rate of increase in pore water pressure particularly for the measurement points where perennial subsurface saturation existed peak runoff was produced with at least two sources of near surface flow and subsurface flow subsurface displacement reduced both the level and rate of increase in peak runoff the internal relations in pore water pressure and the correlations between pore water pressure and runoff weakened after displacement this weakening was likely due to displacement induced cracks facilitating rainwater percolation into bedrock layers and thereby decreasing the linkage between subsurface saturation and surface runoff subsurface displacement also modified the response time such that the maximum responses in pore water pressure and runoff tended to occur earlier than maximum rainfall during the period after displacement this study demonstrates that invisible subsurface displacement directly changes hydrological behaviors and that a headwater area is active sensitive and prone to disturbance even if it is covered by forest keywords hydraulic contribution area headwater pore water pressure rainfall runoff subsurface displacement 1 introduction hydrological behavior may differ among landforms or hillslope units kim et al 2007 fujimoto et al 2011 liang et al 2017 with headwaters generally featuring active hydrological and erosional responses tsukamoto and ohta 1988 gomi et al 2002 reported that headwater systems in forested areas characterized by interactions among hydrological geomorphic and biological processes show greater temporal and spatial variation and proposed that headwater systems require different protection strategies from those based on land use disturbance in forested headwaters is mainly related to extreme meteorological events vegetation conditions and mass movements heavy rainfall associated with a typhoon is one example of an extreme meteorological event that can seriously affect a mountain landscape in east asia huang et al 2012 disturbing forest ecosystems and their dynamics lin et al 2011 changes in vegetation due to forest succession natural disasters or timber harvesting can change rainfall redistribution processes and water balance iida et al 2005 liang 2020b tanaka et al 2008 according to results obtained using the paired watershed approach increases in water yield that accompany forest vegetation removal are highly variable among individual watershed sites tamai et al 2020 mass movements including landslides debris flow and hillslope failures induced by rainfall cause strong and instantaneous disturbance events in forested watersheds montgomery et al 2009 tsou et al 2011 lin and liang 2018 compared to these obvious disturbances the impacts of invisible mass movement such as subsurface displacement on hydrological responses are rarely reported and poorly understood subsurface displacement can be a sign of a debris slide shallow failure or deep seated landslide chigira 1992 sasaki et al 2000 liang 2020a iverson et al 2000 conducted experiments using artificial rainfall on flumes to demonstrate that repeated slip episodes could be induced by gradually increasing pore water pressure and arrested by pore dilation and the associated decrease in pore water pressure okura et al 2002 demonstrated three stages of landslide fluidization compaction of the soil layer by the sliding mass generation of excess pore water pressure and induction of fast shearing they also noted that the increase in pore water pressure near the slip surface is limited and does not exceed the soil layer thickness harp et al 1990 performed three experiments on natural slopes to investigate variation in soil pore water pressure during slope failures induced by subsurface irrigation through trenches in the upslope area their piezometer records showed a consistent trend of increasing pressure during the early stages of infiltration followed by abruptly decreasing pressure 5 50 min before slope failure these results suggest that the dramatic drops in pore water pressure prior to failure as well as dilation and failure itself may be due to piping through fine grained soil particles mirus et al 2017 and uhlemann et al 2017 monitored episodically recurring or slow moving landslides and both studies revealed that subsurface moisture dynamics or drainage patterns changed after landslides these cases suggest that increasing pore water pressure facilitates subsurface displacement and simultaneously that subsurface displacement would change subsurface hydrological behavior however few studies have reported the relationship between subsurface displacement dynamics and runoff responses at large scales in a previous study at a site in a forested headwater liang and chan 2017 we monitored the spatial and temporal variation in pore water pressure at the soil bedrock interface the expansion patterns of subsurface saturation during storm events could be classified into four stages initial fragmentary and unconnected distributions simultaneous downward and upward expansion of saturation with increased rainwater supply interconnection of saturation from upslope to downslope areas around the peak of rainfall and finally disappearance of saturation from the middle slope area during the drying process that study also demonstrated effects of soil depth and the topographic wetness index on spatial and temporal variation in subsurface saturation liang 2020a recorded the dynamics of pore water pressure at the soil bedrock interface during a shallow landslide induced by a typhoon event the dominant factors triggering the landslide were record high pore water pressure wet initial conditions and a heterogeneous distribution of subsurface saturation that study also found that previous subsurface displacement reduced slope stability and facilitated the landslide however the author primarily analyzed the changes in subsurface saturation after subsurface displacement the main objective of this study was to further examine the influences of subsurface displacement on hydrological responses in a steep naturally forested headwater catchment using the same dataset collected over 2 years and reported by liang 2020a the maximum values of rainfall pore water pressure at the soil bedrock interface and surface runoff during rainfall events were used to evaluate differences in the hydrological responses the maximum values lag times and their correlations were compared between periods before and after subsurface displacement 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and site

during replacement of the tensiometers the porous cups were broken and the pvc probes were bent at the tip fig 1c this damage likely resulted from shear forces caused by subsurface displacement around

based on the following equation which has been adopted for the public disaster warning system in taiwan chen and fujita 2013 1 r t i 0 7 α i r i where i is days ri is the amount of rainfall for the antecedent i days α is a weighting factor and rt is the sum of the unadjusted rainfall amount on day 0 and the rainfall amounts in the antecedent 7 days adjusted using α the value of α was set to 0 7 which has been the official value in taiwan since 2014 chen et al 2017 the variable rt represents serial data that can be calculated at any time point fig 2 and rt represents the rt value at the time of ri to assess the properties of pore water pressure 60 measurement points were classified into four frequencies of saturation generation i e pore water pressure 0 the saturation generation frequency at each measurement point was determined using eq 2 as detailed in a previous study liang and chan 2017 2 always μ 0 cm and μ σ 0 cm usually μ 0 cm and μ σ 0 cm sometimes μ 0 cm and μ σ 0 cm rarely μ 0 cm and μ σ 0 cm where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the continuous time series of pore water pressure according to liang and chan 2017 prior to displacement saturation frequencies of always usually sometimes and rarely were observed at 11 3 22 and 24 points among 60 total points respectively fig 1b the mean pore water pressure for each saturation generation frequency is shown in fig 2 the maximum values of mean pore water pressure at all of 60 measurement points pall and at points with saturation frequencies of always usually sometimes and rarely i e palways pusually psometimes and prarely were used to describe the strongest responses of pore water pressure during each rainfall event fig 3 table 1 furthermore the dataset of bedrock topography and pore water pressure was used to evaluate the hydraulic contribution area hydraulic head was calculated at each of 60 measurement points as the sum of pore water pressure plus the elevation of bedrock a grid based map at a 2 m interval i e the mesh shown in fig 1b of hydraulic head was produced at each time point using the ordinary kriging method surfer ver 13 golden software the d infinity approach of tarboton 1997 was used to detect the flow direction and calculate the upslope contribution area for each grid this calculation was based on the assumption that the hydraulic head based plane controls subsurface water flow or surface runoff if percolation into the bedrock is minor the hydraulic contribution area in the grid nearest the origin of surface runoff was selected as the evaluation point fig 1b and the maximum ratio of the hydraulic contribution area at the evaluation point to the total grid area of the site ca was used as another index to evaluate the relationship between pore water pressure and runoff responses the maximum intensity of runoff frunoff during an event was used to describe the peak flow fig 3 table 1 the lag times among the maximum hydrological properties in rainfall pore water pressure and runoff table 1 were calculated i e time of runoff time of pore water pressure time of runoff time of rainfall and time of pore water pressure time of rainfall the order of response times was based on the assumed process of rainwater infiltrating toward the soil bedrock boundary and then flowing out as surface runoff which is synonymous with the variable source area concept hewlett and hibbert 1967 and fill and spill concept spence and woo 2003 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 thus positive and negative lag times refer to cases following these assumptions and not following them respectively moreover the correlations among all indices were evaluated using spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs during the periods before and after subsurface displacement the significance of rs was determined with a threshold of p value 0 05 3 results 3 1 maximum responses of pore water pressure and runoff to rainfall the numbers of rainfall events used for analyses before and after subsurface displacement were 89 and 65 respectively fig 2 when determining the relationship between ri and ra fig 4 a ra after displacement was slightly less than ra before displacement at ri 5 mm 10 min in the relationship between ri and rt fig 4b in contrast rt after displacement was slightly greater than rt before displacement at ri 13 mm 10 min comparing ra to rt fig 4c rt after displacement was slightly greater than rt before displacement at ra 100 mm although the variation in the relationships among ri ra and rt grew during the period after displacement according to the r2 values of regression lines the maximum rainfall properties showed slight changes between observations before and after displacement the relationships between ri and pore water pressure in terms of pall palways pusually psometimes and prarely were weak fig 5 a although all categories of pore water pressure showed high values after displacement their trend lines expressed as exponential regressions had very low coefficients of determination and lacked statistical significance the fitting was improved in the relationships between ra and pore water pressure fig 5b and palways increased markedly after displacement the relationships between rt and pore water pressure were best represented by exponential regressions with three rainfall properties fig 5c pore water pressure showed threshold responses relative to ra or rt and had greater values after displacement fig 5b and c pore water pressure increased with ra or rt when its value was 50 mm but plateaued at values greater than 50 mm greater pore water pressure after displacement was observed for each category of pore water pressure and in particular palways showed large values after displacement focusing on the difference between low and high values of palways the increment after displacement was smaller than that before displacement this indicates that the total level of saturation increased but the rate of increase in saturation decreased after displacement fig 6 shows the lag time between maximum rainfall and pore water pressure sorted by ri ra and rt the lag time was calculated as the time of pall or palways prarely minus the time of ri as the same time point as ra and rt the absolute values of lag time decreased with increases in ri ra or rt with quite similar patterns among all categories of pore water pressure after displacement the mean value lag time shifted from positive to negative and the standard deviation became large these results suggest that the maximum pore water pressure response occurred earlier and varied more after displacement the relationships between ri and frunoff did not significantly differ between observations before and after displacement but the total amount and rate of increase in frunoff after displacement were markedly lower than those before displacement when evaluated using ra or rt fig 7 a this finding indicates that ri contributed equally to frunoff in both periods but the contributions of ri or rt on frunoff weakened after displacement the lag time between maximum rainfall and runoff was calculated as the time of frunoff minus the time of ri fig 7b the absolute value of lag time decreased with increases in ri ra or rt and the lag time values converged with increasing ri the mean value lag time became negative and the standard deviation grew large after displacement suggesting larger variation in lag time after displacement 3 2 maximum response of runoff to pore water pressure maximum pore water pressure and frunoff showed threshold relationships with frunoff values remaining low in the zone of negative pore water pressure and increasing greatly in the zone of positive pore water pressure fig 8 a this tendency was generally consistent between the periods before and after displacement except for palways which lacked negative pore water pressure values and was larger after displacement the fitting magnitude of exponential regressions was lower after displacement indicating greater variation in the relationships between maximum pore water pressure and frunoff after displacement the lag time between maximum pore water pressure and runoff was calculated as the time of frunoff minus the time of pall or palways prarely fig 8b larger variation in lag time was found in the zone where frunoff greatly increased although the standard deviation of lag time was large the mean lag time was generally negative between frunoff and pall or palways prarely during both periods this indicates that the peak of runoff likely occurred earlier than the maximum pore water pressure frunoff appeared to increase with carea prior to displacement but was not related to carea after displacement fig 9 a carea ranged from 7 1 to 11 8 with a mean of 9 2 for events before displacement and from 7 4 to 10 6 with a mean of 8 7 for events after displacement these results indicate that carea decreased slightly after displacement the lag time between carea and frunoff was calculated as the time of frunoff minus the time of carea fig 9b lag time did not show an obvious trend with carea and had large standard deviations during both periods the mean lag time was positive before displacement and became negative after displacement indicating that the peak of runoff occurred later than carea before displacement but earlier than carea after displacement 3 3 correlations among maximum responses in rainfall pore water pressure and runoff before and after subsurface displacement fig 10 shows correlations among the properties of maximum rainfall pore water pressure and runoff values before and after subsurface displacement which were evaluated using spearman s rank correlation coefficient for the relationships between rainfall and pore water pressure maximum pore water pressure was most strongly correlated with rt and secondarily by ra and ri which changed slightly between measurements before and after displacement this finding suggested that maximum pore water pressure was more influenced by antecedent rainfall or accumulated rainfall rather than immediate rainfall among pore water pressure values pall and its components of palways pusually psometimes and prarely showed very high correlations before displacement however the correlations among pore water pressure levels weakened after displacement suggesting that subsurface displacement directly affected the linkages among pore water pressure levels as represented by the four saturation generation frequencies carea was the worst index linked to pore water pressure or runoff and lacked statistical significance for some cases in both periods frunoff appeared to be related to rt ra and ri at equivalent levels which changed little between measurements taken before and after displacement this finding suggests that antecedent rainfall accumulated rainfall and immediate rainfall might have all contributed to peak runoff frunoff was associated with pall and its components however the correlations of frunoff with palways and pusually were low after displacement suggesting that subsurface displacement may have weakened the linkage between subsurface saturation and runoff fig 11 summarizes the lag time of indices of pore water pressure hydraulic contribution area and runoff from maximum rainfall the median or mean values of most indices were recorded later than the time of maximum rainfall before displacement but most were earlier than maximum rainfall after displacement this finding suggests that subsurface displacement directly altered the response time of pore water pressure and runoff 4 discussion the observed changes in the responses of pore water pressure and runoff before and after displacement may have been due to differences in rainfall inputs between the two periods or to the effects of subsurface displacement among three indices of rainfall characteristics rt was slightly greater after displacement relative to an equivalent value of ri or ra fig 4b and c and had the strongest correlations with indices of pore water pressure and runoff fig 10 those results indicate that events after displacement featured greater rainfall amounts in the antecedent 7 days and the headwater may have been wetter at the beginning of rainfall events after displacement based on higher rt values both pore water pressure and runoff should increase with greater rainfall supply during the period after displacement however this inference is inconsistent with the observation results as pall slightly increased fig 5c and frunoff fig 7a markedly decreased after displacement thus changes in hydrological responses between the two periods result mainly from subsurface displacement rather than from differences in rainfall characteristics 4 1 influences of subsurface displacement on the response of pore water pressure subsurface displacement increased the maximum values of pore water pressure reduced the rate of increase in pore water pressure at measurement points with perennial saturation i e palways fig 5 and weakened the correlations among sites for the four saturation generation frequencies fig 10 one possible reason for these results could be that subsurface displacement produced fissures or cracks around the soil bedrock interface or within bedrock layers such displacement induced cracks could serve as preferential pathways facilitating deeper percolation krzeminska et al 2014 sidle and bogaard 2016 uhlemann et al 2017 although longer persistence of positive pore water pressure and slower drainage was also observed at a hillslope with episodic slides compared to a vegetated hillslope mirus et al 2017 in the present study displacement induced cracks likely decreased the linkages in saturation at the soil bedrock interface and the hydraulic plane and thereby facilitated rainwater percolation into bedrock layers along the cracks this inference is supported by the evidence given in fig 12 which shows the spatial distributions of mean pore water pressure and mean ratio of hydraulic contribution area during events before and after displacement using all time series data collected during rainfall events fig 2 these mean values were calculated at each pore water pressure measurement point fig 12a and for each grid based on the ratio of hydraulic contribution area to all total area of the grid fig 12b as indicated by the dashed circles expanded and newly formed saturated zones were found in the middle and downslope areas of the site after displacement the connectivity of the hydraulic contribution area was interrupted in the middle of the site after displacement the locations that showed major changes after displacement were surrounded by detection points with broken tensiometers representing potential points of subsurface displacement this finding suggests that subsurface displacement alters the flow paths and shifted subsurface flow toward deeper locations or downslope points this process caused the groundwater table to rise but limited the rate of increase in palways due to increased loss of rainwater to recharge groundwater the displacement induced cracks also caused faster response times of maximum pore water pressure for pall and its components after displacement fig 11 this change is likely due to the rate of increase in pore water pressure being limited after displacement causing pore water pressure to reach its maximum earlier relative to events before displacement 4 2 influences of subsurface displacement on the runoff generation process the influences of subsurface displacement on the generation processes of runoff were complex because runoff generation processes were associated with both rainfall inputs and contributions from subsurface flow or groundwater the contribution of peak rainfall on peak runoff did not differ between events before and after displacement but the contributions of antecedent rainfall and accumulated rainfall on peak runoff weakened after displacement fig 7a this suggests that peak runoff was produced by at least two sources near surface flow and subsurface flow or groundwater which were associated with peak rainfall and antecedent accumulated rainfall respectively thus subsurface displacement reduced both the amount and rate of increase in peak runoff in the component related to antecedent accumulated rainfall as well as that associated with rainwater percolating through subsurface or bedrock layers more subsurface saturation was required after displacement i e palways in fig 8a to produce peak runoff equivalent to that before displacement the correlations between the properties of maximum pore water pressure and peak runoff weakened after displacement fig 10 thus subsurface displacement also affected the linkage between pore water pressure and runoff one process assumed to generate runoff is rainwater infiltrating toward the soil bedrock boundary and then flowing out as surface runoff however this assumption contradicts the observations at this study site because the response time of maximum pore water pressure was later than the time of peak runoff figs 8b and 11 in addition the assumption that the hydraulic head based plane controls subsurface water flow or surface runoff was not supported at this site fig 9a the generation of subsurface saturation at the soil bedrock interface was driven by both exfiltrated groundwater and excess perched water at the study site liang and chan 2017 notably the soil bedrock interface at the study site was not impermeable during both periods subsurface flow mainly occurred along a specific pathway e g fig 12b rather than expanding over the bedrock surface based on the findings described above the variable source area concept hewlett and hibbert 1967 mcdonnell 2009 and fill and spill concept spence and woo 2003 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 could not be validated at the study site as these concepts are based on the condition of an impermeable bedrock surface similarly analyses techniques based on topographic features such as topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 are not appropriate for application at this study site in future studies a new concept or model must be developed to describe a headwater subsurface environment with abundant cracks prone to displacement and with least two sources of subsurface saturation e g downward infiltration of water lateral movement of perched water or upward increasing of groundwater 5 conclusion we studied the changes in hydrological responses between observations before and after subsurface displacement in a natural forested headwater these observations represent a rare case wherein invisible subsurface displacement directly affected hydrological behaviors the main changes after displacement can be summarized as follows 1 the maximum values of pore water pressure increased but the rate of increase in pore water pressure declined this tendency was obvious at the measurement points with perennial saturation 2 the correlations among sites in the frequency of subsurface saturation generation weakened this change is likely due to displacement induced cracks that reduced the linkages of saturation at the soil bedrock interface and facilitated rainwater percolation into bedrock layers 3 both the level and increment of peak runoff declined peak runoff was produced by at least two sources near surface flow and subsurface flow or groundwater which were associated with peak rainfall and antecedent accumulated rainfall respectively 4 in the period before displacement the maximum responses in pore water pressure and runoff tended to occur later than maximum rainfall however these responses came earlier than maximum rainfall during the period after displacement subsurface displacement also changed the response times of pore water pressure and runoff although subsurface displacement did not obviously damage the surface environment disturbance of subsurface environment had implications for the responses and linkages of pore water pressure at the soil bedrock interface and surface runoff headwater areas are active sensitive and prone to disturbance even those covered with forest in future studies it is essential to elucidate the hydrogeological mechanisms at work in forested headwaters in particular for those with abundant cracks that are prone to displacement and have least two sources of subsurface saturation declaration of

5109,flow velocity is an important parameter for rill erosion process studies the dye tracer method is the most widely used method for measuring rill flow velocity but the influential factors and reasonable values of the correction factor α remain uncertain therefore the experimental datasets from different studies were used to evaluate the α values from the previous studies could be applied to calculate the mean velocity of rill flow and a detailed laboratory study was conducted to investigate the effects of rill morphology and hydraulic characteristics on the α of rill flow the slope gradients varied from 5 to 25 flow discharges from 2 to 8 l min 1 and reynolds numbers from 172 to 1040 the surface velocity was measured by the dye tracer method and the mean velocity was derived indirectly from the flow depth measurements the results showed that a single α value was not suitable for rill flow velocity measurement the α values of rill free flow and rill flow ranged from 0 295 to 0 729 and from 0 330 to 0 990 respectively the effect of the slope gradient on the α of rill free flow was noticeably different from that of rill flow and the α of this study increased with increasing reynolds number for the rill free flow α could be estimated with a logarithmic function of the slope gradient and reynolds number r 2 0 930 nse 0 930 for rill flow α increased linearly with increasing rill width depth and cross sectional area the value of α could be estimated with an equation of the rill depth and reynolds number r 2 0 811 nse 0 811 the results of this study provide a reference for rill flow velocity measurement using the dye tracer method keywords rill erosion flow velocity dye tracer method correction factor rill morphology 1 introduction rill erosion is an important environmental problem around the world because it can cause a large amount of soil loss and seriously threaten the sustainable development of agriculture di stefano et al 2019a shen et al 2015 kimaro et al 2008 lei et al 2008 with the formation of rills surface flow gradually converts into concentrated flow thereby leading to increased sediment yield with increasing flow shear stress velocity and depth qin et al 2018a 2018b liu et al 2011 flow velocity is an important parameter for rill erosion studies yang et al 2018a zhang and wang 2017 qian et al 2016 guo et al 2013 flow velocity is directly related not only to soil detachment sediment transport and deposition zhuang et al 2018 yang et al 2018b zhang and wang 2017 rahma et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 but also to the calculation of other hydraulic parameters e g reynolds number froude number and darcy weisbach friction factor however the rill flow depth is usually very shallow dong et al 2014 lei et al 2010 and is easily affected by slope gradient flow discharge sediment load and bed surface roughness huang et al 2018 foster et al 1984 which makes it difficult to accurately measure rill flow velocity therefore how to accurately measure rill flow velocity has always been an important hotspot of soil erosion research many instruments have been used to measure the velocity of open channel flow yang et al 2018a such as water current meters fulford 2001 and ultrasonic flowmeter lozano and mateos 2010 however these traditional instruments are not suitable for measuring rill flow velocity because the rill flow depth is usually in the cm or mm range belonging to shallow water flow dong et al 2014 although many technologies for measuring flow velocity have been used in soil erosion research such as hot film anemometers robinson and cook 1998 particle imaging velocimeters muste et al 2014 raffel et al 2007 1998 and acoustic doppler velocimeters giménez et al 2004 they have certain limitations for example an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv is not suitable for measuring shallow water flow velocity because its application requires deeper flow depth a hot film anemometer cannot be used to measure the velocity of sediment laden flow due to the fact that the thin quartz layer of the electrically insulated platinum film can be coated by sediments or abraded by sand particles zhang et al 2010 planchon et al 2005 particle imaging velocimeter piv is expensive and not convenient for field experiment the complex instruments also limit the application of this technology the dye tracer method is the most widely used method for measuring rill flow velocity di stefano et al 2019b nearing et al 1999 govers 1992 gilley et al 1990 abrahams et al 1986 the dye tracer method is used to measure flow velocity by recording the travel time of a dye over a given distance di stefano et al 2020 zhang et al 2010 since the dye tracer method only requires visual observation of the tracer motion without any particular instruments wirtz et al 2012 it has the advantages of operational simplicity and low cost however the dye tracer method is usually used to measure the surface velocity of water flow luk and merz 1992 planchon et al 2005 zhang et al 2010 which needs to be corrected by the correction factor α to obtain the mean flow velocity therefore selecting the correction factor α is the key to determining the mean flow velocity several studies have reported that the values of the correction factor α are different for laminar and turbulent flows ranging from 0 4 to 0 9 ali et al 2012 king and norton 1992 luk and merz 1992 emmett 1970 horton et al 1934 horton et al 1934 first proposed the theoretical value of α under different hydraulic conditions on smooth and fixed beds the mean velocity was only two thirds 0 67 of the surface velocity for laminar flow and the α was usually 0 75 to 0 90 for turbulent flow emmett 1970 found by flume experiments that the values of α equal 0 80 for turbulent flow and 0 67 or slightly less for laminar flow luk and merz 1992 found by field and laboratory experiments that the maximum velocity measured by a salt tracer was compatible with that determined by a dye tracer in field experiments the mean values of α for laminar flow and all experiments were 0 53 and 0 52 respectively for the datasets from laboratory experiments the α varied from 0 61 to 0 86 with an average value of 0 75 they suggested that the deviation of α could be explained by the overestimation of surface velocity and the effect of raindrop impact current research on α has mainly focused on its influential factors di stefano et al 2018 2019a pan et al 2015 ali et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 dunkerley 2001 li et al 1996 li and abrahams 1997 king and norton 1992 these studies indicated that the slope gradient zhang et al 2010 li et al 1996 li and abrahams 1997 king and norton 1992 reynolds number pan et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 li et al 1996 li and abrahams 1997 sediment load zhang et al 2010 xia et al 2003 li and abrahams 1997 sediment particle size ali et al 2012 and characteristics of the rough surface di stefano et al 2018 2019a pan et al 2015 were the important influential factors of α in addition several scholars have established predictive equations of α based on these factors zhang et al 2010 li et al 1996 li and abrahams 1997 however previous studies have demonstrated that the influential factors of α are controversial and even contradictory for example king and norton 1992 investigated the influential factors of α and analysed the relationship between α and slope gradient and reynolds number the results showed that α increased with increasing slope gradient but α was independent of reynolds number dunkerley 2001 evaluated the feasibility of the dye tracer method in measuring the flow velocity the board was roughened with plant litter and ceramic tiles to simulate the conditions of dry land soils it was found that there was no obvious relationship between α and reynolds number and the characteristics of the rough surface could affect the value of α li et al 1996 conducted 40 experiments using a 5 2 0 4 m flume under three slope gradients 2 7 5 5 and 10 to investigate the influential factors of α they found that α varied directly with reynolds number and inversely with slope gradient which was different from the conclusions of king and norton 1992 and dunkerley 2001 king and norton 1992 measured the flow velocity using a dyed calcium chloride solution and conductivity probes the results of king and norton 1992 were different from those of dunkerley 2001 and li et al 1996 which might be related to different measurement method in the study of li et al 1996 the reynolds numbers ranged from 1902 to 12606 however the values of the reynolds number in the study of dunkerley 2001 were less than 500 the hydraulic differences between the two studies were the reason for the different conclusions in addition li et al 1996 found that α was inversely proportional to slope gradient but he did not explain why α was related to slope gradient in subsequent experiments li and abrahams 1997 suggested that the effect of slope gradient on α was related to flow sediment transport xia et al 2003 evaluated the influential factors of α using a 5 0 15 m flume under slope gradients ranging from 0 5 to 12 and sediment concentrations ranging from 0 to 60 16 it was found that α varied directly with sediment concentration which was contrary to the conclusion of li and abrahams 1997 xia et al 2003 suggested that the diffusion speed of salt solution decreased and the friction coefficient of water flow increased with increasing sediment concentration which made the correction factor increased zhang et al 2010 conducted a series of laboratory experiments using a flume of 5 m long 0 4 m wide the results showed that α decreased with increasing sediment load for sediment laden flow which was consistent with the conclusion of li and abrahams 1997 the conclusions of xia et al 2003 was different from those of zhang et al 2010 and li and abrahams 1997 which was related to different experimental conditions in addition the correction factors reported by xia et al 2003 were calculated from the ratio of mean flow velocity to peak concentration velocity salt tracing technique however the correction factors reported by zhang et al 2010 and li and abrahams 1997 were calculated from the ratio of mean flow velocity to surface velocity or leading edge velocity different calculation methods of correction factor also lead to different conclusions di stefano et al 2018 2017 carried out the investigation on shaped rills using a 2 m wide and 7 m long plot and assessed the dye trace method for rill flow velocity measurements using literature data they deduced a new equation for rill flow resistance calibrated directly from surface velocity measurements and suggested that α could be assumed to be a constant 0 665 or 0 80 furthermore di stefano et al 2020 established the theoretical relationship between α and the power velocity profile using the published data by ferro and baiamonte 1994 and coleman 1986 they found that α increased with increasing roughness height for sediment free flow and α decreased with increasing sediment load on a smooth bed for sediment laden flow all previously cited studies have provided a better reference for the application of the dye tracer method for rill flow the characterization of flow regimes is complicated due to the rapid development of rills qin et al 2019 in particular surface flow gradually converted into concentrated flow after the formation of rills shen et al 2015 which could cause a higher velocity and transport capacity gatto 2000 the variations of rill morphology can affect the hydrological process and form a feedback effect with sediment yield and runoff zhang et al 2016 2019 shen et al 2016 since rill morphology plays an important role in determining runoff and soil loss of hill slope shen et al 2015 govindaraju and kavvas 1994 the study of rill morphology has become a hotspot for rill erosion researches in recent years ran et al 2018 shen et al 2015 torri et al 2012 auerswald et al 2009 for example zhang et al 2019 used rill density fractal dimension geomorphological comentropy and topological parameters as morphological indicators to investigate the effects of rill morphology evolution on the rill erosion process and embedded the rill erosion coefficient into the soil erosion model furthermore studies have increasingly found that the rill morphology evolution is very important for understanding the hydrodynamic characteristics of rill flow qin et al 2019 2018a 2018b ran et al 2018 de lima and abrantes 2014 however the majority of earlier studies on correction factor neglected the variation in rill morphology pan et al 2015 ali et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 dunkerley 2001 li et al 1996 li and abrahams 1997 king and norton 1992 although some studies have considered the variability of α values di stefano et al 2020 2018 a single α was still used to calculate rill mean flow velocity aksoy et al 2016 2017 govers et al 2007 gimenez and govers 2001 tayfur 2007 nearing et al 1999 govers 1992 taking into account the variability of α values in previous studies di stefano et al 2020 pan et al 2015 ali et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 dunkerley 2001 li et al 1996 li and abrahams 1997 king and norton 1992 selecting an inappropriate α value may cause a sizeable error in rill erosion research therefore the selection of an appropriate α value is still a challenge for current rill erosion models and rill flow hydraulics therefore the main goals of this research were i to evaluate if the values of α proposed in previous studies can be used to measure rill flow velocity ii to investigate the effects of rill morphology and hydraulic characteristics on the α of rill flow and iii to determine the key parameters that affect the α of rill flow and establish the corresponding equations 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental soil samples soil samples were collected from abandoned farmland in yangling 108 3 e 34 16 n shaanxi province china which is located in the southern part of the loess plateau the soil was sampled from a depth of approximately 0 2 m the bulk density in the field ranges from 1 1 to 1 3 g cm 3 the soil contained 4 35 sand 69 78 silt and 25 87 clay particles in addition the soil was readily detachable poorly aggregated and composed of 0 57 organic matter 2 2 experimental setup the experimental system was set up with the following components a peristaltic pump water supply pipes buffering pits experimental flumes and many buckets fig 1 the inflow water was controlled and supplied by a peristaltic pump three channel so that each trial was repeated three times simultaneously the peristaltic pump was tuned before each experiment to achieve the designed flow rate the loss of water flow during the experiment was low due to presaturation of the soil furthermore the flow rate was evaluated in the outlet of the flume during each experiment referring to the previous study of rill erosion yang et al 2018a huang et al 2018 chen et al 2017 2015 ban et al 2016 lei et al 2001 each of the experimental flume segments was 2 6 m long 0 1 m wide and 0 4 m high fig 1 several drainage holes were created at the bottom of the flume to allow the free drainage of excess water the upper and lower ends of the flume were fixed with a piece of wood l 0 10 m w 0 10 m h 0 35 m to overcome the edge effects and ensure that the water flow spread uniformly over the flume moreover the length of the lower stopper was only 0 10 m which allowed it to pass through the mixture of sediment and water without causing serious deposition ali et al 2012 the experimental soil samples were air dried 10 0 05 gravimetric moisture content and sieved through a 10 mm mesh to remove stones and grass roots prior to the start of the experiment before packing the flume a 15 cm deep layer of sand was packed at the bottom of the flume to allow the free drainage of excess water a highly permeable gauze was used to separate the sand and soil layers subsequently soil samples were packed 20 cm deep in the flume in four 5 cm layers to achieve the given bulk densities 1 2 g cm 3 before each layer was packed the soil layer was raked slightly to diminish the discontinuity between layers to avoid the impact of the flume sidewalls on water flow the soil surface elevation near the flume sidewalls was packed slightly higher than that in the middle part of the flume after packing the soil samples in the flume were wetted to reach the field capacity and then the flume was wrapped with a plastic sheet and allowed to settle for more than 12 h to provide a uniform initial water content distribution and to eliminate the effects of uneven packing the part between the upper stopper and the soil layer was covered with a piece of gauze to reduce immediate erosion 2 3 experimental procedures the experiments involved a series of 15 combinations of slope gradients 5 10 15 20 and 25 and flow discharges 2 4 and 8 l min 1 to simulate the process of rill erosion from gentle slope gradients to steeper slope gradients fifteen treatments with three replicates were conducted for a total of 45 experimental runs and each trial duration was 10 min for each run the flow velocity measurement depth measurement and sediment sample collection were carried out simultaneously at 1 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 min after the start of the experiment as soon as the flow depth measurement velocity measurement and sediment sample collection were completed in 2 5 10 min of the experiment the water supply was immediately stopped and the rill cross section was measured in the first 1 min of the experiment there were no obvious rills on the flume therefore the cross section was not measured the surface velocity v dye was measured by the dye tracer potassium permanganate solution method at a distance of 1 4 m from the water inlet of the flume a small amount of the dye was added to the flow with a dropper the amount of the dye injected into the flow remained unchanged in each experiment a digital stopwatch was used to record the travel time required for the leading edge of the dye cloud to move 1 m over the flume since the measured travel time was related to the reaction time of the observer there are some errors in travel time measurements dunkerley 2001 therefore each measurement was observed by the same observer and each measurement of surface velocity was repeated five times to ensure the accuracy of the experiment the average of the five repetitions of the same velocity measurement was considered as the mean surface flow velocity moreover the measurement was discarded and repeated when a mistake was made e g the leading edge of the dye was difficult to observe the flow depth was measured by using a precision limnimeter the accuracy of the limnimeter was 0 01 cm in the study of ali et al 2012 a piece of wood was placed at the lower end of the mobile bed and the flow depth was measured on the wood ali et al 2012 showed that the flow velocity calculated by this method could represent the mean flow velocity inside the flume furthermore zhang et al 2010 also argued that the flow depth measurements below the section of surface velocity measurement could be used to calculate the mean flow velocities inside the flume therefore the method reported by ali et al 2012 was used in this study to measure the flow depth at the lower stopper of the flume the limnimeter was mounted on a wooden frame above the lower stopper of the flume fig 1 each measurement of flow depth was repeated six times and the measurement was discarded and repeated when a mistake was made the average of the six flow depth was considered as the mean flow depth table s1 the flow surface was nonuniform during the experiment which was caused by the existence of undulations and ripples the flow depth was measured as quickly as possible between two undulations or ripples and the average value was calculated by increasing the number of measurements to eliminate the effect of undulations or ripples on the measurement pan et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 three sediment samples were harvested using collecting tanks at the outlet of the flume for each combination of slope gradient and flow discharge the sediment concentration was determined with the traditional oven dry method the sediment load was calculated by dividing the dry sediment weight by the flume width and sampling time the water supply was stopped 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 min after the experimental began and the rill cross section was measured at distances of 0 4 0 9 1 4 1 9 and 2 4 m from the water inlet of the flume fig 2 no new small rills formed during each experiment and the rill cross section was measured on the basis of the original rill a rillmeter was used to measure the rill cross section the rillmeter was composed of nine pins each with a diameter of 3 mm installed on a board a ruler on the board showed the elevation of each pin the accuracy of the rillmeter was 0 1 cm 2 4 data treatments 2 4 1 key parameters the rill width w rill depth d cross sectional area as

the hydrodynamic characteristics were affected by the changes in rill morphology due to the complicated changes in the scour of flow correlation analyses of the reynolds number re rill depth d width w width depth ratio w d cross sectional area as slope gradient s sediment load sl and sediment concentration sc are shown in fig 3 the rill morphological parameters influenced the reynolds number in the following order w as d the correlation coefficient ranged from 0 49 to 0 84 the results indicated that the rill morphological parameters were related to the reynolds number the experimental results of the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method v dye at different discharges and slopes are listed in table s2 the measured v dye ranged from 0 325 to 1 156 m s 1 under the whole range of morphologic and hydraulic conditions furthermore the rill erosion process also affects the flow velocity the v dye always decreased with increasing time fig 4 when time increased from 1 min to 2 5 min 2 5 min to 5 min 5 min to 7 5 min and 7 5 min to 10 min the measured v dye decreased by 23 013 15 103 6 944 and 5 244 respectively at the later stage of rill erosion the decrease rate of v dye became weaker with increasing time and v dye tended toward a steady value during the period from 7 5 to 10 min fig 4 this trend may be related to the process of rill erosion at the earlier stage of experiment the roughness of bed surface change little compared with that before the experiment the flow velocity was higher because less flow energy was consumed by overcoming resistance the rill depth and width gradually increased with increasing time the hydraulic resistance increased due to the formation of rill sidewalls which would consume more flow energy furthermore the detachment of soil particle and transportation of sediments also consumed flow energy the decrease rate of surface velocity decreased gradually with increasing time and then surface velocity became steady in the later stage of the experiment 7 5 10 min this may be due to the soil and the erosive agent the water reached a state of relative balance in the later stage of the experiment the mean velocity v depth exhibited the same trend as that of v dye that is v depth decreased with increasing time fig 5 a as shown in fig 5b v depth was close to v dye when the velocity values were low and the fitted linear curve gradually approached the 1 1 line however the difference between those two values became larger with increasing velocity which might affect the measurement accuracy of the dye tracer method considering this variation in mean velocity with surface velocity it seems impossible to suggest a single α value for all hydraulic and rill morphologic conditions 3 2 hypothesis validation the surface velocities and average velocities were used to calculate the correction factor α under five slope gradients and three flow discharges the values of correction factor α ranged from 0 295 to 0 990 with a mean value of 0 603 in this experiment table 1 fig 6 shows the frequency distribution of α at different times as shown in fig 6 the frequency distribution of α in the first 1 min was different from that in 2 5 10 min of the experiment in the first 1 min there were no obvious rills on the flume due to the lower erosion intensity which made the coefficients of variation cv and the standard deviation std in the first 1 min lower those in 2 5 10 min of the experiment the maximum minimum and mean values of α increased with increasing time and the cv and the std also increased with increasing time indicating that the constant activity of rill erosion can affect α this observation makes us question and rethink the accuracy of using a single α value for the dye method to verify our hypothesis α values of 0 466 zhang et al 2010 0 67 horton et al 1934 0 75 luk and merz 1992 and 0 8 di stefano et al 2018 were selected to further analyse the effects of a single α value on the mean velocity the experimental datasets were selected from the literature abrantes et al 2018 ali et al 2012 li et al 1996 li and abrahams 1997 and from our own experiment the results showed that there was a large gap between the predicted mean velocities and measured mean values some points were quite far from the 1 1 line fig 7 indicating that some mean velocity values were overestimated or underestimated the relative error re rrmse and mre calculated by our own datasets were relatively high table 2 meaning that a single α value was not suitable for measuring rill flow velocity by the dye method the mean velocity is not only an important parameter in the study of soil erosion yang et al 2018a but also the basis for calculating other hydraulic parameters errors will be compounded when erroneous values of mean velocity are introduced into the subsequent calculations of hydraulic parameters for example the denominator in the formula of the darcy weisbach friction factor f is v2 when the mean velocity increases by 10 the f decreases by 17 36 the calculated value of f will decrease by 30 56 when the mean velocity increases by 20 indicating that the erroneous values of the mean velocity will make the calculation error of f become larger the calculation error of f will lead to overestimation or underestimation of surface roughness therefore the mean velocity value will be overestimated or underestimated when a single α value is used to calculate the mean velocity which may lead to a failure to analyse hydraulic characteristics further work is needed to develop a model for the prediction of α under different hydraulic and rill morphologic conditions 3 3 correction factor α of rill free flow in the first 1 min of the experiment there were no obvious rills on the flume the lower erosion intensity caused little change in the roughness of the bed surface compared with that before the experiment after the formation of rills the bed surface roughness exhibited a large change which rendered the correction factors in the first 1 min far less than those in 2 5 10 min of the experiment accordingly to conveniently analyse the effect of rill morphology on the correction coefficient α the water flow in the first 1 min was considered the rill free flow sheet flow and that of 2 5 10 min was regarded as the rill flow in the first minute of the experiment the measured flow depths and reynolds numbers ranged from 0 123 to 0 237 cm and from 198 to 1039 respectively the values of α varied from 0 295 to 0 729 with a mean value of 0 493 in the first minute of the experiment for comparison with prior studies the slope gradient sediment load and reynolds number were used for further analysis in the first minute of the experiment α decreased with increasing slope gradient fig 8 a and α increased as the flow depth increased fig 8b however the α of rill free flow at all combinations of slope gradients and flow discharges was not particularly sensitive to sediment load in this study fig 8c α was mainly related to the reynolds number fig 8d stepwise regression analyses between the slope gradient reynolds number sediment load and α produced the best fitting equation 9 α 0 709 0 402 log re 0 213 log s r 2 0 930 n s e 0 930 comparisons between measured and predicted α using eq 9 are plotted in fig 9 as shown in fig 9a the data points were close to the 1 1 line and the rmse was only 0 033 although the regression equation only contained parameters of the reynolds number and slope gradient it still showed higher prediction accuracy table 3 3 4 correction factor α of rill flow in this study there were significant differences between the α values of the rill flow and rill free flow the average value of the α of rill flow 0 631 was 27 99 higher than that of rill free flow 0 493 the reynolds numbers varied from 172 to 1040 and α varied from 0 330 to 0 990 the value of α slightly increased with increasing time fig 10 there were no obvious changes in the α values as the slope gradient increased for rill flow the reynolds number still had a great effect on α fig 11 as shown in fig 10 α increased with increasing rill depth at different flow discharges and slope gradients indicating that the rill morphology could affect α to further study the effect of rill morphology on α the relationships among the rill morphology indexes w d d w and as and α were analysed the value of α increased linearly with rill depth width and cross sectional area fig 11 the stepwise regression produced the following equation 10 α 0 919 0 546 log re 0 032 d r 2 0 811 n s e 0 811 eq 10 shows that the correction factor had a good correlation with flow discharge and surface velocity as shown in fig 9b the correction factors predicted by eq 10 were relatively close to the measured α the rmse was only 0 089 all the data points agreed well with the 1 1 line 4 discussion in this study there were significant correlations among the rill morphological parameters and reynolds number fig 3 which indicate that the change in rill erosion is closely related to the flow pattern furthermore v depth exhibited the same trend as v dye a possible explanation is that v dye and v depth can be regarded as the surface velocity and mean velocity of the flow velocity profile respectively the v dye and v depth should present the same trend under the same bed surface roughness condition similar results were reported by abrantes et al 2018 and ali et al 2012 v depth was far less than v dye at the first minute of rill erosion however v depth became closer to v dye with increasing time fig 5 generally the dye tracer method resulted in higher velocities than mean velocities abrantes et al 2018 ali et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 the v dye and v depth decreased with increasing time which may be related to the changes in bed roughness caused by rill erosion the flow energy consumption increased with the increasing sediment concentration of rill flow as a result the flow velocity decreased with increasing time furthermore the difference in tracer diffusion for higher and lower flow velocities is another possible reason 4 1 the influence of hydraulic characteristics on the estimate of rill free flow α in the first minute of the experiment α decreased with increasing slope gradient fig 8a which was also reported by zhang et al 2010 and li and abrahams 1997 zhang et al 2010 argued that this trend might be related to the changes in flow velocity and depth and found that flow depth decreased and velocity increased with increasing slope gradient which resulted in a gradually more dispersed velocity profile similar trends were found in our study that is α increased as the flow depth increased fig 8b the reason for this trend may be explained by the combined effect of bed surface roughness and flow turbulence in the whole process of rill erosion the bed roughness was constantly changing due to the eroding action of the water flow on the bed material and structure di stefano et al 2019a and the roughness of the mobile bed was far greater than that of the fixed bed hu and abrahams 2006 for a given flow discharge the soil detachment rate increased with increasing slope gradient which results in sediment load and bed surface roughness at the steep slope were greater those at the gentle slope zhang et al 2010 believed that the viscosity of sediment laden flow increased with increasing sediment concentration resulting in a decrease in flow turbulence the bed load transported by the flowing water transfers momentum from flow to the grains and the momentum transfer increased with increasing sediment load zhang et al 2010 li and abrahams 1997 abrahams and li 1998 the velocity profile was affected by momentum transfer flow viscosity and bed surface roughness zhang et al 2010 resulting a reduction of α value the correction factor α of rill free flow increased with increasing reynolds number fig 8d this trend was attributed to the increase in flow turbulence zhang et al 2010 flow turbulence results in better mixing zhang et al 2010 several researchers reported that sediment load had a great effect on α and α decreased with increasing sediment load ali et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 li and abrahams 1997 the α decreased as the sediment load increased at various flow discharges in this study however the α of rill free flow at all combinations of slope gradients and flow discharges was not particularly sensitive to the sediment load fig 8c which may be related to the lower erosion intensity in the first minute of the experiment 4 2 the influence of rill morphologies on the estimate of rill flow α as shown in fig 6 the maximum and average values of α for rill flow were higher than those of rill free flow the minimum maximum and average values of α of rill flow in our study were higher than those of sediment load flow reported by zhang et al 2010 the reynolds number still has a great effect on α it was easy to understand that a better mixing of runoff and sediment after the surface flow gradually converted into concentrated flow with the emergence of rills led to an increase in α the value of α displayed a rising trend with increasing soil loss the maximum value of α gradually approached 1 under high flow discharge fig 11 especially in the later stage of the experiment 7 5 10 min this trend was different from the conclusions of previous studies conducted on fixed beds the possible explanation was related to the emergence of rills the rill was gradually generated with increasing time and the surface flow was gradually concentrated in the rill which caused the rill depth and width to gradually increase the bed topography was considerably modified by the water flow resulting in irregularity of rill longitudinal profiles gimenez and govers 2001 also found the irregularity of rill longitudinal profiles and showed that the amplitude and frequency variations of bed heights had a great influence on rill flow velocity when the flowing water passed through irregular rill channel it needed to overcome the greater resistance as the flowing water consumed more energy to overcome the resistance the flow velocity decreased furthermore because soil substances can absorb some common dyes e g potassium permanganate and methylene blue flury and wai 2003 small amounts of dye tracer were adsorbed onto the surface of rill sidewalls the adsorption may affect the measurement of flow velocity the irregularity of the rill bed surface lead to a better mixing of runoff dye and sediment the observed leading peak of dye tracer may be replaced by the maximum concentration of dye which may cause vs to be lower than the maximum velocity pan et al 2015 there were no obvious changes in the α values with increasing slope gradient which was not only different from the trend of rill free flow but also different from the conclusions of li and abrahams 1997 and zhang et al 2010 ali et al 2012 carried out a series of experiments on the mobile bed under different slope gradients but the relationship between α and slope gradient was not mentioned the published data by ali et al 2012 were used to analyse the relationship between slope gradient and α the results showed that α was not particularly sensitive to slope gradient under different median grain sizes in this study α of rill free flow decreased with increasing slope gradient and the slope gradient had a significant effect on α however water flow tended to cause rapid surface cutting over time resulting in significant changes in bed topography irregular bed topography caused changes in the soil surface resistance however the resistance and sediments prevented a change of rill flow α this might be the reason why the slope gradient had no effect on the α at the later stage of this experiment since both the data published by ali et al 2012 and the data from our study indicated that the slope gradient had no effect on α of rill flow we are concerned about the accuracy of the predictive equation of α based on the slope gradient proposed in previous studies in addition as mentioned earlier a single α value was not suitable for rill flow velocity measurement obviously the problems described above have been avoided by eq 10 which was established in this study 4 3 testing new equations of rill free and rill flow α eq 9 shows that the rill free flow α could be estimated with a logarithmic function of re and s the value of α was inversely proportional to the slope gradient and proportional to the reynolds number which was consistent with the conclusions of zhang et al 2010 and li and abrahams 1997 however the equation in this study did not contain the parameter of sediment load and the regression coefficient of the reynolds number 0 409 was higher than that reported by li et al 1996 0 114 zhang et al 2010 0 384 and di stefano et al 2019a and di stefano et al 2019b 0 2534 the regression coefficient of the slope gradient 0 212 was lower than that reported by li et al 1996 0 327 significant differences in the α values were found between the measured α in our experiment and the α calculated using the equations reported by zhang et al 2010 table 3 the rrmse and mre values calculated by zhang s and di stefano s equations were higher than those calculated by the equation established in this study the α values predicted by di stefano s equation were lower than the measured values which may be related to the different experimental conditions di stefano s equation was established by using the experimental datasets from coleman 1986 the re reported by coleman 1986 ranged from 178 106 to 203492 which was higher than that of our study the prediction precision of the equation with three parameters developed by zhang et al 2010 was far lower than that calculated by the equation with two parameters established in this study table 3 the rill flow α could be estimated with a logarithmic function of re and d the regression coefficient of the reynolds number was higher than that of li et al 1996 zhang et al 2010 and di stefano et al 2019a and di stefano et al 2019b the measured α of rill flow was predicted by using the equations reported by zhang et al 2010 and di stefano et al 2019a and di stefano et al 2019b table 4 as shown in table 4 the rrmse and mre values calculated by zhang s equations were higher than those calculated by eq 10 for the α of rill flow the re values calculated by zhang s equations were higher than those of rill free flow furthermore the predicted α values calculated by di stefano s equation were all lower than the measured α values as mentioned earlier this result may be related to different experimental conditions the α of rill flow was not sensitive to the slope gradient which may also lead to the lower α predicted by di stefano et al 2019a and di stefano et al 2019b overall eq 10 could be used to predict the correction factor accurately 5 conclusions in this study the effects of rill morphology and hydraulic characteristics on the correction factor α of rill flow were studied in a flume experiment the results showed that the rill morphology and hydraulic parameters changed significantly with increasing time the α of rill free flow was particularly sensitive to the reynolds number the value of α could be predicted by an equation of the slope gradient and reynolds number however there was no obvious relationship between the slope gradient and the α of rill flow the rill morphology indexes had a large effect on the α of rill flow and α could be predicted by the equation of reynolds number and rill depth in addition the hypothesis that a single α value was not suitable for rill flow velocity measurement was verified by using the experimental data sets from different literatures in general the conclusions of this study provide a reference for the application of the dye tracer method and prove that a single α is not suitable for the calculation of the mean velocity of rill flow the problem should be considered in the measurement of rill flow velocity by the dye method the equations established in this study can facilitate the prediction of α which establishes a foundation for further research however we only simulated the laminar and transitional flow conditions in this study the equations should be used judiciously and further studies are needed to validate the applicability of the equations credit authorship contribution statement d m yang conceptualization

5109,flow velocity is an important parameter for rill erosion process studies the dye tracer method is the most widely used method for measuring rill flow velocity but the influential factors and reasonable values of the correction factor α remain uncertain therefore the experimental datasets from different studies were used to evaluate the α values from the previous studies could be applied to calculate the mean velocity of rill flow and a detailed laboratory study was conducted to investigate the effects of rill morphology and hydraulic characteristics on the α of rill flow the slope gradients varied from 5 to 25 flow discharges from 2 to 8 l min 1 and reynolds numbers from 172 to 1040 the surface velocity was measured by the dye tracer method and the mean velocity was derived indirectly from the flow depth measurements the results showed that a single α value was not suitable for rill flow velocity measurement the α values of rill free flow and rill flow ranged from 0 295 to 0 729 and from 0 330 to 0 990 respectively the effect of the slope gradient on the α of rill free flow was noticeably different from that of rill flow and the α of this study increased with increasing reynolds number for the rill free flow α could be estimated with a logarithmic function of the slope gradient and reynolds number r 2 0 930 nse 0 930 for rill flow α increased linearly with increasing rill width depth and cross sectional area the value of α could be estimated with an equation of the rill depth and reynolds number r 2 0 811 nse 0 811 the results of this study provide a reference for rill flow velocity measurement using the dye tracer method keywords rill erosion flow velocity dye tracer method correction factor rill morphology 1 introduction rill erosion is an important environmental problem around the world because it can cause a large amount of soil loss and seriously threaten the sustainable development of agriculture di stefano et al 2019a shen et al 2015 kimaro et al 2008 lei et al 2008 with the formation of rills surface flow gradually converts into concentrated flow thereby leading to increased sediment yield with increasing flow shear stress velocity and depth qin et al 2018a 2018b liu et al 2011 flow velocity is an important parameter for rill erosion studies yang et al 2018a zhang and wang 2017 qian et al 2016 guo et al 2013 flow velocity is directly related not only to soil detachment sediment transport and deposition zhuang et al 2018 yang et al 2018b zhang and wang 2017 rahma et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 but also to the calculation of other hydraulic parameters e g reynolds number froude number and darcy weisbach friction factor however the rill flow depth is usually very shallow dong et al 2014 lei et al 2010 and is easily affected by slope gradient flow discharge sediment load and bed surface roughness huang et al 2018 foster et al 1984 which makes it difficult to accurately measure rill flow velocity therefore how to accurately measure rill flow velocity has always been an important hotspot of soil erosion research many instruments have been used to measure the velocity of open channel flow yang et al 2018a such as water current meters fulford 2001 and ultrasonic flowmeter lozano and mateos 2010 however these traditional instruments are not suitable for measuring rill flow velocity because the rill flow depth is usually in the cm or mm range belonging to shallow water flow dong et al 2014 although many technologies for measuring flow velocity have been used in soil erosion research such as hot film anemometers robinson and cook 1998 particle imaging velocimeters muste et al 2014 raffel et al 2007 1998 and acoustic doppler velocimeters giménez et al 2004 they have certain limitations for example an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv is not suitable for measuring shallow water flow velocity because its application requires deeper flow depth a hot film anemometer cannot be used to measure the velocity of sediment laden flow due to the fact that the thin quartz layer of the electrically insulated platinum film can be coated by sediments or abraded by sand particles zhang et al 2010 planchon et al 2005 particle imaging velocimeter piv is expensive and not convenient for field experiment the complex instruments also limit the application of this technology the dye tracer method is the most widely used method for measuring rill flow velocity di stefano et al 2019b nearing et al 1999 govers 1992 gilley et al 1990 abrahams et al 1986 the dye tracer method is used to measure flow velocity by recording the travel time of a dye over a given distance di stefano et al 2020 zhang et al 2010 since the dye tracer method only requires visual observation of the tracer motion without any particular instruments wirtz et al 2012 it has the advantages of operational simplicity and low cost however the dye tracer method is usually used to measure the surface velocity of water flow luk and merz 1992 planchon et al 2005 zhang et al 2010 which needs to be corrected by the correction factor α to obtain the mean flow velocity therefore selecting the correction factor α is the key to determining the mean flow velocity several studies have reported that the values of the correction factor α are different for laminar and turbulent flows ranging from 0 4 to 0 9 ali et al 2012 king and norton 1992 luk and merz 1992 emmett 1970 horton et al 1934 horton et al 1934 first proposed the theoretical value of α under different hydraulic conditions on smooth and fixed beds the mean velocity was only two thirds 0 67 of the surface velocity for laminar flow and the α was usually 0 75 to 0 90 for turbulent flow emmett 1970 found by flume experiments that the values of α equal 0 80 for turbulent flow and 0 67 or slightly less for laminar flow luk and merz 1992 found by field and laboratory experiments that the maximum velocity measured by a salt tracer was compatible with that determined by a dye tracer in field experiments the mean values of α for laminar flow and all experiments were 0 53 and 0 52 respectively for the datasets from laboratory experiments the α varied from 0 61 to 0 86 with an average value of 0 75 they suggested that the deviation of α could be explained by the overestimation of surface velocity and the effect of raindrop impact current research on α has mainly focused on its influential factors di stefano et al 2018 2019a pan et al 2015 ali et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 dunkerley 2001 li et al 1996 li and abrahams 1997 king and norton 1992 these studies indicated that the slope gradient zhang et al 2010 li et al 1996 li and abrahams 1997 king and norton 1992 reynolds number pan et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 li et al 1996 li and abrahams 1997 sediment load zhang et al 2010 xia et al 2003 li and abrahams 1997 sediment particle size ali et al 2012 and characteristics of the rough surface di stefano et al 2018 2019a pan et al 2015 were the important influential factors of α in addition several scholars have established predictive equations of α based on these factors zhang et al 2010 li et al 1996 li and abrahams 1997 however previous studies have demonstrated that the influential factors of α are controversial and even contradictory for example king and norton 1992 investigated the influential factors of α and analysed the relationship between α and slope gradient and reynolds number the results showed that α increased with increasing slope gradient but α was independent of reynolds number dunkerley 2001 evaluated the feasibility of the dye tracer method in measuring the flow velocity the board was roughened with plant litter and ceramic tiles to simulate the conditions of dry land soils it was found that there was no obvious relationship between α and reynolds number and the characteristics of the rough surface could affect the value of α li et al 1996 conducted 40 experiments using a 5 2 0 4 m flume under three slope gradients 2 7 5 5 and 10 to investigate the influential factors of α they found that α varied directly with reynolds number and inversely with slope gradient which was different from the conclusions of king and norton 1992 and dunkerley 2001 king and norton 1992 measured the flow velocity using a dyed calcium chloride solution and conductivity probes the results of king and norton 1992 were different from those of dunkerley 2001 and li et al 1996 which might be related to different measurement method in the study of li et al 1996 the reynolds numbers ranged from 1902 to 12606 however the values of the reynolds number in the study of dunkerley 2001 were less than 500 the hydraulic differences between the two studies were the reason for the different conclusions in addition li et al 1996 found that α was inversely proportional to slope gradient but he did not explain why α was related to slope gradient in subsequent experiments li and abrahams 1997 suggested that the effect of slope gradient on α was related to flow sediment transport xia et al 2003 evaluated the influential factors of α using a 5 0 15 m flume under slope gradients ranging from 0 5 to 12 and sediment concentrations ranging from 0 to 60 16 it was found that α varied directly with sediment concentration which was contrary to the conclusion of li and abrahams 1997 xia et al 2003 suggested that the diffusion speed of salt solution decreased and the friction coefficient of water flow increased with increasing sediment concentration which made the correction factor increased zhang et al 2010 conducted a series of laboratory experiments using a flume of 5 m long 0 4 m wide the results showed that α decreased with increasing sediment load for sediment laden flow which was consistent with the conclusion of li and abrahams 1997 the conclusions of xia et al 2003 was different from those of zhang et al 2010 and li and abrahams 1997 which was related to different experimental conditions in addition the correction factors reported by xia et al 2003 were calculated from the ratio of mean flow velocity to peak concentration velocity salt tracing technique however the correction factors reported by zhang et al 2010 and li and abrahams 1997 were calculated from the ratio of mean flow velocity to surface velocity or leading edge velocity different calculation methods of correction factor also lead to different conclusions di stefano et al 2018 2017 carried out the investigation on shaped rills using a 2 m wide and 7 m long plot and assessed the dye trace method for rill flow velocity measurements using literature data they deduced a new equation for rill flow resistance calibrated directly from surface velocity measurements and suggested that α could be assumed to be a constant 0 665 or 0 80 furthermore di stefano et al 2020 established the theoretical relationship between α and the power velocity profile using the published data by ferro and baiamonte 1994 and coleman 1986 they found that α increased with increasing roughness height for sediment free flow and α decreased with increasing sediment load on a smooth bed for sediment laden flow all previously cited studies have provided a better reference for the application of the dye tracer method for rill flow the characterization of flow regimes is complicated due to the rapid development of rills qin et al 2019 in particular surface flow gradually converted into concentrated flow after the formation of rills shen et al 2015 which could cause a higher velocity and transport capacity gatto 2000 the variations of rill morphology can affect the hydrological process and form a feedback effect with sediment yield and runoff zhang et al 2016 2019 shen et al 2016 since rill morphology plays an important role in determining runoff and soil loss of hill slope shen et al 2015 govindaraju and kavvas 1994 the study of rill morphology has become a hotspot for rill erosion researches in recent years ran et al 2018 shen et al 2015 torri et al 2012 auerswald et al 2009 for example zhang et al 2019 used rill density fractal dimension geomorphological comentropy and topological parameters as morphological indicators to investigate the effects of rill morphology evolution on the rill erosion process and embedded the rill erosion coefficient into the soil erosion model furthermore studies have increasingly found that the rill morphology evolution is very important for understanding the hydrodynamic characteristics of rill flow qin et al 2019 2018a 2018b ran et al 2018 de lima and abrantes 2014 however the majority of earlier studies on correction factor neglected the variation in rill morphology pan et al 2015 ali et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 dunkerley 2001 li et al 1996 li and abrahams 1997 king and norton 1992 although some studies have considered the variability of α values di stefano et al 2020 2018 a single α was still used to calculate rill mean flow velocity aksoy et al 2016 2017 govers et al 2007 gimenez and govers 2001 tayfur 2007 nearing et al 1999 govers 1992 taking into account the variability of α values in previous studies di stefano et al 2020 pan et al 2015 ali et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 dunkerley 2001 li et al 1996 li and abrahams 1997 king and norton 1992 selecting an inappropriate α value may cause a sizeable error in rill erosion research therefore the selection of an appropriate α value is still a challenge for current rill erosion models and rill flow hydraulics therefore the main goals of this research were i to evaluate if the values of α proposed in previous studies can be used to measure rill flow velocity ii to investigate the effects of rill morphology and hydraulic characteristics on the α of rill flow and iii to determine the key parameters that affect the α of rill flow and establish the corresponding equations 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental soil samples soil samples were collected from abandoned farmland in yangling 108 3 e 34 16 n shaanxi province china which is located in the southern part of the loess plateau the soil was sampled from a depth of approximately 0 2 m the bulk density in the field ranges from 1 1 to 1 3 g cm 3 the soil contained 4 35 sand 69 78 silt and 25 87 clay particles in addition the soil was readily detachable poorly aggregated and composed of 0 57 organic matter 2 2 experimental setup the experimental system was set up with the following components a peristaltic pump water supply pipes buffering pits experimental flumes and many buckets fig 1 the inflow water was controlled and supplied by a peristaltic pump three channel so that each trial was repeated three times simultaneously the peristaltic pump was tuned before each experiment to achieve the designed flow rate the loss of water flow during the experiment was low due to presaturation of the soil furthermore the flow rate was evaluated in the outlet of the flume during each experiment referring to the previous study of rill erosion yang et al 2018a huang et al 2018 chen et al 2017 2015 ban et al 2016 lei et al 2001 each of the experimental flume segments was 2 6 m long 0 1 m wide and 0 4 m high fig 1 several drainage holes were created at the bottom of the flume to allow the free drainage of excess water the upper and lower ends of the flume were fixed with a piece of wood l 0 10 m w 0 10 m h 0 35 m to overcome the edge effects and ensure that the water flow spread uniformly over the flume moreover the length of the lower stopper was only 0 10 m which allowed it to pass through the mixture of sediment and water without causing serious deposition ali et al 2012 the experimental soil samples were air dried 10 0 05 gravimetric moisture content and sieved through a 10 mm mesh to remove stones and grass roots prior to the start of the experiment before packing the flume a 15 cm deep layer of sand was packed at the bottom of the flume to allow the free drainage of excess water a highly permeable gauze was used to separate the sand and soil layers subsequently soil samples were packed 20 cm deep in the flume in four 5 cm layers to achieve the given bulk densities 1 2 g cm 3 before each layer was packed the soil layer was raked slightly to diminish the discontinuity between layers to avoid the impact of the flume sidewalls on water flow the soil surface elevation near the flume sidewalls was packed slightly higher than that in the middle part of the flume after packing the soil samples in the flume were wetted to reach the field capacity and then the flume was wrapped with a plastic sheet and allowed to settle for more than 12 h to provide a uniform initial water content distribution and to eliminate the effects of uneven packing the part between the upper stopper and the soil layer was covered with a piece of gauze to reduce immediate erosion 2 3 experimental procedures the experiments involved a series of 15 combinations of slope gradients 5 10 15 20 and 25 and flow discharges 2 4 and 8 l min 1 to simulate the process of rill erosion from gentle slope gradients to steeper slope gradients fifteen treatments with three replicates were conducted for a total of 45 experimental runs and each trial duration was 10 min for each run the flow velocity measurement depth measurement and sediment sample collection were carried out simultaneously at 1 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 min after the start of the experiment as soon as the flow depth measurement velocity measurement and sediment sample collection were completed in 2 5 10 min of the experiment the water supply was immediately stopped and the rill cross section was measured in the first 1 min of the experiment there were no obvious rills on the flume therefore the cross section was not measured the surface velocity v dye was measured by the dye tracer potassium permanganate solution method at a distance of 1 4 m from the water inlet of the flume a small amount of the dye was added to the flow with a dropper the amount of the dye injected into the flow remained unchanged in each experiment a digital stopwatch was used to record the travel time required for the leading edge of the dye cloud to move 1 m over the flume since the measured travel time was related to the reaction time of the observer there are some errors in travel time measurements dunkerley 2001 therefore each measurement was observed by the same observer and each measurement of surface velocity was repeated five times to ensure the accuracy of the experiment the average of the five repetitions of the same velocity measurement was considered as the mean surface flow velocity moreover the measurement was discarded and repeated when a mistake was made e g the leading edge of the dye was difficult to observe the flow depth was measured by using a precision limnimeter the accuracy of the limnimeter was 0 01 cm in the study of ali et al 2012 a piece of wood was placed at the lower end of the mobile bed and the flow depth was measured on the wood ali et al 2012 showed that the flow velocity calculated by this method could represent the mean flow velocity inside the flume furthermore zhang et al 2010 also argued that the flow depth measurements below the section of surface velocity measurement could be used to calculate the mean flow velocities inside the flume therefore the method reported by ali et al 2012 was used in this study to measure the flow depth at the lower stopper of the flume the limnimeter was mounted on a wooden frame above the lower stopper of the flume fig 1 each measurement of flow depth was repeated six times and the measurement was discarded and repeated when a mistake was made the average of the six flow depth was considered as the mean flow depth table s1 the flow surface was nonuniform during the experiment which was caused by the existence of undulations and ripples the flow depth was measured as quickly as possible between two undulations or ripples and the average value was calculated by increasing the number of measurements to eliminate the effect of undulations or ripples on the measurement pan et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 three sediment samples were harvested using collecting tanks at the outlet of the flume for each combination of slope gradient and flow discharge the sediment concentration was determined with the traditional oven dry method the sediment load was calculated by dividing the dry sediment weight by the flume width and sampling time the water supply was stopped 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 min after the experimental began and the rill cross section was measured at distances of 0 4 0 9 1 4 1 9 and 2 4 m from the water inlet of the flume fig 2 no new small rills formed during each experiment and the rill cross section was measured on the basis of the original rill a rillmeter was used to measure the rill cross section the rillmeter was composed of nine pins each with a diameter of 3 mm installed on a board a ruler on the board showed the elevation of each pin the accuracy of the rillmeter was 0 1 cm 2 4 data treatments 2 4 1 key parameters the rill width w rill depth d cross sectional area as and width depth ratio w d were used to analyse the characteristics of rill morphology the mean velocity was calculated from the flow depth 1 v depth q wh where v depth is the mean velocity of flow m s 1 q is the flow discharge m3 s 1 w is the flow width 0 1 m and h is the measured mean flow depth m the correction factor α can be calculated by 2 α v depth v dye where v dye is the surface velocity of flow m s 1 the reynolds number re can be calculated by 3 re v depth h ν s where ν s is the kinematic viscosity of sediment laden flow m2 s 1 which was established by rescoe 1952 the value of ν s can be calculated by 4 ν s ν 1 1 35 c 2 5 where c is the volumetric sediment concentration and ν is the kinematic viscosity of sediment free flow m2 s 1 which can be calculated by 5 ν 0 01775 1 0 0337 t 0 000221 t 2 where t is the measured temperature of flow c 2 4 2 statistical analysis the relative root mean square error rrmse the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the mean relative error mre were used to evaluate the simulated results of the equations the formulae are 6 rrmse 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 o 7 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 8 mre 1 n i 1 n o i p i o i

predicted values good nse 0 7 satisfactory 0 4 nse 0 7 and unsatisfactory nse 0 4 ahmad et al 2011 3 results 3 1 hydraulic characteristics in this study the reynolds numbers ranged from 172 to 1040 the hydrodynamic characteristics were affected by the changes in rill morphology due to the complicated changes in the scour of flow correlation analyses of the reynolds number re rill depth d width w width depth ratio w d cross sectional area as slope gradient s sediment load sl and sediment concentration sc are shown in fig 3 the rill morphological parameters influenced the reynolds number in the following order w as d the correlation coefficient ranged from 0 49 to 0 84 the results indicated that the rill morphological parameters were related to the reynolds number the experimental results of the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method v dye at different discharges and slopes are listed in table s2 the measured v dye ranged from 0 325 to 1 156 m s 1 under the whole range of morphologic and hydraulic conditions furthermore the rill erosion process also affects the flow velocity the v dye always decreased with increasing time fig 4 when time increased from 1 min to 2 5 min 2 5 min to 5 min 5 min to 7 5 min and 7 5 min to 10 min the measured v dye decreased by 23 013 15 103 6 944 and 5 244 respectively at the later stage of rill erosion the decrease rate of v dye became weaker with increasing time and v dye tended toward a steady value during the period from 7 5 to 10 min fig 4 this trend may be related to the process of rill erosion at the earlier stage of experiment the roughness of bed surface change little compared with that before the experiment the flow velocity was higher because less flow energy was consumed by overcoming resistance the rill depth and width gradually increased with increasing time the hydraulic resistance increased due to the formation of rill sidewalls which would consume more flow energy furthermore the detachment of soil particle and transportation of sediments also consumed flow energy the decrease rate of surface velocity decreased gradually with increasing time and then surface velocity became steady in the later stage of the experiment 7 5 10 min this may be due to the soil and the erosive agent the water reached a state of relative balance in the later stage of the experiment the mean velocity v depth exhibited the same trend as that of v dye that is v depth decreased with increasing time fig 5 a as shown in fig 5b v depth was close to v dye when the velocity values were low and the fitted linear curve gradually approached the 1 1 line however the difference between those two values became larger with increasing velocity which might affect the measurement accuracy of the dye tracer method considering this variation in mean velocity with surface velocity it seems impossible to suggest a single α value for all hydraulic and rill morphologic conditions 3 2 hypothesis validation the surface velocities and average velocities were used to calculate the correction factor α under five slope gradients and three flow discharges the values of correction factor α ranged from 0 295 to 0 990 with a mean value of 0 603 in this experiment table 1 fig 6 shows the frequency distribution of α at different times as shown in fig 6 the frequency distribution of α in the first 1 min was different from that in 2 5 10 min of the experiment in the first 1 min there were no obvious rills on the flume due to the lower erosion intensity which made the coefficients of variation cv and the standard deviation std in the first 1 min lower those in 2 5 10 min of the experiment the maximum minimum and mean values of α increased with increasing time and the cv and the std also increased with increasing time indicating that the constant activity of rill erosion can affect α this observation makes us question and rethink the accuracy of using a single α value for the dye method to verify our hypothesis α values of 0 466 zhang et al 2010 0 67 horton et al 1934 0 75 luk and merz 1992 and 0 8 di stefano et al 2018 were selected to further analyse the effects of a single α value on the mean velocity the experimental datasets were selected from the literature abrantes et al 2018 ali et al 2012 li et al 1996 li and abrahams 1997 and from our own experiment the results showed that there was a large gap between the predicted mean velocities and measured mean values some points were quite far from the 1 1 line fig 7 indicating that some mean velocity values were overestimated or underestimated the relative error re rrmse and mre calculated by our own datasets were relatively high table 2 meaning that a single α value was not suitable for measuring rill flow velocity by the dye method the mean velocity is not only an important parameter in the study of soil erosion yang et al 2018a but also the basis for calculating other hydraulic parameters errors will be compounded when erroneous values of mean velocity are introduced into the subsequent calculations of hydraulic parameters for example the denominator in the formula of the darcy weisbach friction factor f is v2 when the mean velocity increases by 10 the f decreases by 17 36 the calculated value of f will decrease by 30 56 when the mean velocity increases by 20 indicating that the erroneous values of the mean velocity will make the calculation error of f become larger the calculation error of f will lead to overestimation or underestimation of surface roughness therefore the mean velocity value will be overestimated or underestimated when a single α value is used to calculate the mean velocity which may lead to a failure to analyse hydraulic characteristics further work is needed to develop a model for the prediction of α under different hydraulic and rill morphologic conditions 3 3 correction factor α of rill free flow in the first 1 min of the experiment there were no obvious rills on the flume the lower erosion intensity caused little change in the roughness of the bed surface compared with that before the experiment after the formation of rills the bed surface roughness exhibited a large change which rendered the correction factors in the first 1 min far less than those in 2 5 10 min of the experiment accordingly to conveniently analyse the effect of rill morphology on the correction coefficient α the water flow in the first 1 min was considered the rill free flow sheet flow and that of 2 5 10 min was regarded as the rill flow in the first minute of the experiment the measured flow depths and reynolds numbers ranged from 0 123 to 0 237 cm and from 198 to 1039 respectively the values of α varied from 0 295 to 0 729 with a mean value of 0 493 in the first minute of the experiment for comparison with prior studies the slope gradient sediment load and reynolds number were used for further analysis in the first minute of the experiment α decreased with increasing slope gradient fig 8 a and α increased as the flow depth increased fig 8b however the α of rill free flow at all combinations of slope gradients and flow discharges was not particularly sensitive to sediment load in this study fig 8c α was mainly related to the reynolds number fig 8d stepwise regression analyses between the slope gradient reynolds number sediment load and α produced the best fitting equation 9 α 0 709 0 402 log re 0 213 log s r 2 0 930 n s e 0 930 comparisons between measured and predicted α using eq 9 are plotted in fig 9 as shown in fig 9a the data points were close to the 1 1 line and the rmse was only 0 033 although the regression equation only contained parameters of the reynolds number and slope gradient it still showed higher prediction accuracy table 3 3 4 correction factor α of rill flow in this study there were significant differences between the α values of the rill flow and rill free flow the average value of the α of rill flow 0 631 was 27 99 higher than that of rill free flow 0 493 the reynolds numbers varied from 172 to 1040 and α varied from 0 330 to 0 990 the value of α slightly increased with increasing time fig 10 there were no obvious changes in the α values as the slope gradient increased for rill flow the reynolds number still had a great effect on α fig 11 as shown in fig 10 α increased with increasing rill depth at different flow discharges and slope gradients indicating that the rill morphology could affect α to further study the effect of rill morphology on α the relationships among the rill morphology indexes w d d w and as and α were analysed the value of α increased linearly with rill depth width and cross sectional area fig 11 the stepwise regression produced the following equation 10 α 0 919 0 546 log re 0 032 d r 2 0 811 n s e 0 811 eq 10 shows that the correction factor had a good correlation with flow discharge and surface velocity as shown in fig 9b the correction factors predicted by eq 10 were relatively close to the measured α the rmse was only 0 089 all the data points agreed well with the 1 1 line 4 discussion in this study there were significant correlations among the rill morphological parameters and reynolds number fig 3 which indicate that the change in rill erosion is closely related to the flow pattern furthermore v depth exhibited the same trend as v dye a possible explanation is that v dye and v depth can be regarded as the surface velocity and mean velocity of the flow velocity profile respectively the v dye and v depth should present the same trend under the same bed surface roughness condition similar results were reported by abrantes et al 2018 and ali et al 2012 v depth was far less than v dye at the first minute of rill erosion however v depth became closer to v dye with increasing time fig 5 generally the dye tracer method resulted in higher velocities than mean velocities abrantes et al 2018 ali et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 the v dye and v depth decreased with increasing time which may be related to the changes in bed roughness caused by rill erosion the flow energy consumption increased with the increasing sediment concentration of rill flow as a result the flow velocity decreased with increasing time furthermore the difference in tracer diffusion for higher and lower flow velocities is another possible reason 4 1 the influence of hydraulic characteristics on the estimate of rill free flow α in the first minute of the experiment α decreased with increasing slope gradient fig 8a which was also reported by zhang et al 2010 and li and abrahams 1997 zhang et al 2010 argued that this trend might be related to the changes in flow velocity and depth and found that flow depth decreased and velocity increased with increasing slope gradient which resulted in a gradually more dispersed velocity profile similar trends were found in our study that is α increased as the flow depth increased fig 8b the reason for this trend may be explained by the combined effect of bed surface roughness and flow turbulence in the whole process of rill erosion the bed roughness was constantly changing due to the eroding action of the water flow on the bed material and structure di stefano et al 2019a and the roughness of the mobile bed was far greater than that of the fixed bed hu and abrahams 2006 for a given flow discharge the soil detachment rate increased with increasing slope gradient which results in sediment load and bed surface roughness at the steep slope were greater those at the gentle slope zhang et al 2010 believed that the viscosity of sediment laden flow increased with increasing sediment concentration resulting in a decrease in flow turbulence the bed load transported by the flowing water transfers momentum from flow to the grains and the momentum transfer increased with increasing sediment load zhang et al 2010 li and abrahams 1997 abrahams and li 1998 the velocity profile was affected by momentum transfer flow viscosity and bed surface roughness zhang et al 2010 resulting a reduction of α value the correction factor α of rill free flow increased with increasing reynolds number fig 8d this trend was attributed to the increase in flow turbulence zhang et al 2010 flow turbulence results in better mixing zhang et al 2010 several researchers reported that sediment load had a great effect on α and α decreased with increasing sediment load ali et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 li and abrahams 1997 the α decreased as the sediment load increased at various flow discharges in this study however the α of rill free flow at all combinations of slope gradients and flow discharges was not particularly sensitive to the sediment load fig 8c which may be related to the lower erosion intensity in the first minute of the experiment 4 2 the influence of rill morphologies on the estimate of rill flow α as shown in fig 6 the maximum and average values of α for rill flow were higher than those of rill free flow the minimum maximum and average values of α of rill flow in our study were higher than those of sediment load flow reported by zhang et al 2010 the reynolds number still has a great effect on α it was easy to understand that a better mixing of runoff and sediment after the surface flow gradually converted into concentrated flow with the emergence of rills led to an increase in α the value of α displayed a rising trend with increasing soil loss the maximum value of α gradually approached 1 under high flow discharge fig 11 especially in the later stage of the experiment 7 5 10 min this trend was different from the conclusions of previous studies conducted on fixed beds the possible explanation was related to the emergence of rills the rill was gradually generated with increasing time and the surface flow was gradually concentrated in the rill which caused the rill depth and width to gradually increase the bed topography was considerably modified by the water flow resulting in irregularity of rill longitudinal profiles gimenez and govers 2001 also found the irregularity of rill longitudinal profiles and showed that the amplitude and frequency variations of bed heights had a great influence on rill flow velocity when the flowing water passed through irregular rill channel it needed to overcome the greater resistance as the flowing water consumed more energy to overcome the resistance the flow velocity decreased furthermore because soil substances can absorb some common dyes e g potassium permanganate and methylene blue flury and wai 2003 small amounts of dye tracer were adsorbed onto the surface of rill sidewalls the adsorption may affect the measurement of flow velocity the irregularity of the rill bed surface lead to a better mixing of runoff dye and sediment the observed leading peak of dye tracer may be replaced by the maximum concentration of dye which may cause vs to be lower than the maximum velocity pan et al 2015 there were no obvious changes in the α values with increasing slope gradient which was not only different from the trend of rill free flow but also different from the conclusions of li and abrahams 1997 and zhang et al 2010 ali et al 2012 carried out a series of experiments on the mobile bed under different slope gradients but the relationship between α and slope gradient was not mentioned the published data by ali et al 2012 were used to analyse the relationship between slope gradient and α the results showed that α was not particularly sensitive to slope gradient under different median grain sizes in this study α of rill free flow decreased with increasing slope gradient and the slope gradient had a significant effect on α however water flow tended to cause rapid surface cutting over time resulting in significant changes in bed topography irregular bed topography caused changes in the soil surface resistance however the resistance and sediments prevented a change of rill flow α this might be the reason why the slope gradient had no effect on the α at the later stage of this experiment since both the data published by ali et al 2012 and the data from our study indicated that the slope gradient had no effect on α of rill flow we are concerned about the accuracy of the predictive equation of α based on the slope gradient proposed in previous studies in addition as mentioned earlier a single α value was not suitable for rill flow velocity measurement obviously the problems described above have been avoided by eq 10 which was established in this study 4 3 testing new equations of rill free and rill flow α eq 9 shows that the rill free flow α could be estimated with a logarithmic function of re and s the value of α was inversely proportional to the slope gradient and proportional to the reynolds number which was consistent with the conclusions of zhang et al 2010 and li and abrahams 1997 however the equation in this study did not contain the parameter of sediment load and the regression coefficient of the reynolds number 0 409 was higher than that reported by li et al 1996 0 114 zhang et al 2010 0 384 and di stefano et al 2019a and di stefano et al 2019b 0 2534 the regression coefficient of the slope gradient 0 212 was lower than that reported by li et al 1996 0 327 significant differences in the α values were found between the measured α in our experiment and the α calculated using the equations reported by zhang et al 2010 table 3 the rrmse and mre values calculated by zhang s and di stefano s equations were higher than those calculated by the equation established in this study the α values predicted by di stefano s equation were lower than the measured values which may be related to the different experimental conditions di stefano s equation was established by using the experimental datasets from coleman 1986 the re reported by coleman 1986 ranged from 178 106 to 203492 which was higher than that of our study the prediction precision of the equation with three parameters developed by zhang et al 2010 was far lower than that calculated by the equation with two parameters established in this study table 3 the rill flow α could be estimated with a logarithmic function of re and d the regression coefficient of the reynolds number was higher than that of li et al 1996 zhang et al 2010 and di stefano et al 2019a and di stefano et al 2019b the measured α of rill flow was predicted by using the equations reported by zhang et al 2010 and di stefano et al 2019a and di stefano et al 2019b table 4 as shown in table 4 the rrmse and mre values calculated by zhang s equations were higher than those calculated by eq 10 for the α of rill flow the re values calculated by zhang s equations were higher than those of rill free flow furthermore the predicted α values calculated by di stefano s equation were all lower than the measured α values as mentioned earlier this result may be related to different experimental conditions the α of rill flow was not sensitive to the slope gradient which may also lead to the lower α predicted by di stefano et al 2019a and di stefano et al 2019b overall eq 10 could be used to predict the correction factor accurately 5 conclusions in this study the effects of rill morphology and hydraulic characteristics on the correction factor α of rill flow were studied in a flume experiment the results showed that the rill morphology and hydraulic parameters changed significantly with increasing time the α of rill free flow was particularly sensitive to the reynolds number the value of α could be predicted by an equation of the slope gradient and reynolds number however there was no obvious relationship between the slope gradient and the α of rill flow the rill morphology indexes had a large effect on the α of rill flow and α could be predicted by the equation of reynolds number and rill depth in addition the hypothesis that a single α value was not suitable for rill flow velocity measurement was verified by using the experimental data sets from different literatures in general the conclusions of this study provide a reference for the application of the dye tracer method and prove that a single α is not suitable for the calculation of the mean velocity of rill flow the problem should be considered in the measurement of rill flow velocity by the dye method the equations established in this study can facilitate the prediction of α which establishes a foundation for further research however we only simulated the laminar and transitional flow conditions in this study the equations should be used judiciously and further studies are needed to validate the applicability of the equations credit authorship contribution statement d m yang conceptualization
