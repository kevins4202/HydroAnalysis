10805,precise estimations of energy fluxes and evapotranspiration for cropland in arid areas with shallow groundwater are necessary but limited there is also a need to better understand the contribution of groundwater for meeting crop water consumptive use in this study considering the environmental conditions such as meteorological variables crop growth and water regimes energy fluxes and actual evapotranspiration eta in an irrigated maize field with shallow groundwater were examined using eddy covariance system during two growing seasons due to the energy imbalance of the eddy covariance method latent heat le was adjusted using the bowen ratio preservation of energy principle and subsequently very close r2 0 94 to that measured by the bowen ratio energy balance system for seasonal and diurnal variations le accounted for the highest proportion of net radiation rn from the jointing stage while le rn was a little lower in 2018 than that in 2017 which may be because of the deeper groundwater table depth wtd in 2018 the negative sensible heat in the afternoon implied the occurrence of heat advection in the irrigated cropland energy fluxes and eta were significantly affected by crop development when leaf area index was less than about 4 m2 m 2 moreover the increasing wtd from 1 2 to 2 2 m decreased le by about 70 and increased daily average bowen ratio from the jointing stage total eta was 522 1 and 453 8 mm in 2017 and 2018 respectively the inter seasonal variation in eta was more dependent on water conditions than the potential evaporative demand the water balance result showed that average wtd of 1 52 and 1 76 m for the growing period contributed to 36 3 and 26 2 eta in 2017 and 2018 respectively besides daily groundwater contribution between two seasons was different because of the differences in irrigation allocation and wtd these results highlight the key effect of shallow groundwater to energy fluxes and water exchange of agroecosystem in arid areas keywords energy fluxes maize evapotranspiration groundwater contribution irrigation schedule eddy covariance 1 introduction energy fluxes and water vapor exchange are always of importance for the interaction between land surface ecosystems and atmosphere baldocchi et al 2004 rodrigues et al 2014 timouk et al 2009 in agricultural area available solar radiation evapotranspiration et and carbon fluxes ultimately determine yield and water productivity shen et al 2013 the processes are always influenced by several interacting biophysical and environmental factors such as climate condition crop development and water supplies lei and yang 2010 suyker and verma 2008 accurate assessment of heat fluxes and et is essential for addressing water scarcity and climate change in agroecosystems anapalli et al 2018 bezerra et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 in arid areas where crop growth depends on supplemental irrigation due to the lack of rainfall et i e water exchange corresponding to le plays the most critical role in the hydrological cycle bezerra et al 2015 ding et al 2013 based on four years data of eddy covariance ec system shen et al 2013 concluded that for the irrigated cropland in north china plain water and energy balances are mainly influenced by the planting pattern and irrigation schedule and not the irrigation sources groundwater or surface water variations in et and energy fluxes are also closely related to crop growth status as the important energy fluxes components latent heat le is often the main contributor to the water loss during crop growing season while the proportion of sensible heat h increases during non growing period gao et al 2018b suyker and verma 2008 zhang et al 2016 knowledge of the seasonal and inter annual variability in et and its controlling factors could help develop appropriate irrigation schedule and model crop production burba and verma 2005 li et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 our research area the hetao plain is the third largest irrigation district in china and an important food production area agriculture in the area almost entirely depends on irrigation water diverted from the yellow river which accounts for more than 90 of total water consumption xue and ren 2017 large volumes of flood irrigation withdrawal could reduce the stream flow of the yellow river and change agricultural production shen et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 new water saving strategies are being developed for sustainable water management in the irrigated corridors on a regional scale a decrease in water supply could affect groundwater table and crop water use chen et al 2018 various scenarios including irrigation schemes and groundwater depths are simulated to optimize groundwater water table depth wtd for stable transpiration ren et al 2018 or water productivity gao et al 2018a for field scale researches shallow groundwater contributed towards partially meeting crop water demands gao et al 2017 wang et al 2016 and to produce stable yield of rainfed maize in the us corn belt rizzo et al 2018 and the inland pampas in argentina nosetto et al 2009 for irrigated maize in arid areas it could be more complicated since irrigation can also change shallow groundwater depth there is an urgent need to untangle water exchange processes in cropland with shallow groundwater for better management of water resources and agricultural production to the best of our knowledge research on surface energy fluxes and actual evapotranspiration eta over irrigated cropland in arid areas with shallow groundwater is limited in this two years study these data were measured by the ec system providing necessary information for agricultural water management and water productivity improvement in similar areas the specific objectives were to 1 assess the variations of energy fluxes at both mean hourly and seasonal scales in irrigated maize fields in an arid area with shallow groundwater 2 evaluate the influencing factors of energy fluxes and maize eta such as crop growth and water regime and 3 quantify the changed groundwater contributions to maize eta with varying wtd and irrigation schedules 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this study was conducted in a cropland 107 39 e 41 09 n 1032 m altitude in hetao irrigation district with an area of 1 12 million ha fig 1 the area is located in the upper reaches of the yellow river northwest china where approximate 5 billion m3 water are diverted from the yellow river annually xu et al 2015 this area has a typical continental arid and semi arid climate the average annual 2000 2014 precipitation and potential evaporation are about 170 and 2300 mm respectively chen et al 2018 some related description of this district can be referred from ren et al 2018 and xue and ren 2017 maize is widely planted in the area because of high yield and drought tolerance in the experiment maize zeyu 19 was sown on may 12 2017 and on april 28 2018 and they were harvested at the end of september for both years the experimental maize field in 2018 is shown in fig 1 and all surrounded by maize the total area of maize was more than 10 ha the experimental field in 2017 about 1 ha was half of that in 2018 there are generally three or four irrigations applied to maize during the entire growing season the soil texture in the experimental area is mainly silt loam and silt clay loam within 1 m depth from the soil surface liu et al 2019 2 2 field measurements 2 2 1 meteorological crop growth and water conditions micrometeorological data such as solar radiation rs air temperature t relative humidity rh precipitation air pressure and wind speed were recorded at 30 min intervals using the automatic weather station kits hobo u30 onset computer corp usa near the experimental field at 2 m height regrading crop growth condition six plants were randomly chosen to measure green leaf area index lai about every ten days using a portable leaf area meter beijing yaxinliyi science and technology corp china every green leaf was scanned to obtain the total leaves area of each maize plant lai was calculated as the ratio of average green leaves area of plant m2 plant 1 to the planting density m2 plant 1 meanwhile the height of maize was also measured using a ruler and the maximum height could reach about 3 3 m soil sensors hydra probe stevens water monitoring system inc usa were installed to observe soil volumetric water content swc and soil temperature data were recorded at 1 h intervals and then averaged at daily scale soil samples at 10 30 50 70 and 90 cm were collected six times to determine gravimetric soil water contents using oven drying method ren et al 2016 schunk et al 2016 which was then used to calibrate daily average swc measured by hydra probe sensors groundwater table depth wtd was recorded at 0 5 h intervals by hobo water level logger u20 onset computer corp usa installed in a well in the center of the field 2 2 2 eddy covariance method the ec system produces a direct estimate of h and le fluxes and is widely used to measure energy and gas exchanges between the terrestrial ecosystem and atmosphere meyers and hollinger 2004 wolf et al 2008 the three dimensional csat3 sonic anemometer gill solent istruments uk with an open path infrared h2o co2 analyzer li 7500 li cor inc usa was located about 1 5 m above the maximum canopy height and the location was adjusted once during the maize growing period data were sampled at 10 hz and recorded at 30 min intervals using the cr3000 data logger data were post processed with the eddypro li cor software including spike detection frequency response corrections conversion of sonic temperature into actual temperature schotanus et al 1983 coordinate rotation using planar fit method and wpl webb pearman leuning density correction webb et al 1980 turbulent fluxes le and h and bowen ratio were calculated by the following equations 1 l e λ ρ a w q 2 h c p ρ a w t 3 β h l e where λ is the heat of water vaporization j kg 1 ρa is air density kg m 3 w q is the covariance between turbulent fluctuations of vertical wind speed w m s 1 and the scalar mixing rations cp is specific heat capacity of air j kg 1 k 1 t is the sonic temperature k β is the bowen ratio gao et al 2018b perez et al 1999 net radiation rn was measured with a cnr4 l10 net radiometer kipp zonen netherlands installed at the height of 1 m above the maximum canopy two hfp01 heat flux plates hukseflux netherlands were buried at about 6 cm below the soil surface to calculate soil surface heat flux gs with soil moisture cs616 soil moisture sensors and temperature tcav averaging soil thermocouple probe measurements one plate was in the middle of the two rows maize with film mulching and the other was in the bare soil between the row space the distance between them was about 60 cm in this study ec measurements were continuously carried out from about june to the end of september in 2017 and 2018 the observation field was also surrounded by maize field in 2018 fig 1 providing adequate fetch length for ec measurements the ec system fetch analysis indicated that about 90 of the flux originated within 100 m upwind of the tower and ne e wind is the predominant wind direction in this region while the field in 2017 with a narrow shape could be smaller than the fetch length in some directions 2 2 3 potential and actual evapotranspiration daily potential evapotranspiration et0 and vapor pressure deficit vpd were calculated from penman monteith method in fao 56 allen et al 1998 based on the meteorological observations at 2 m height the crop coefficient kc defined as the ratio of eta to et0 was obtained to character crop water consumption after excluding the potential evaporative demand daily equivalent maize eta was converted from daily measured le according to fao 56 allen et al 1998 and as follows 4 e t a l e λ ρ w where ρw is water density g cm 3 then groundwater contribution or groundwater evapotranspiration etg was calculated using the water balance equation 5 e t g p i δ s w c e t a p c where p and i are precipitation and irrigation respectively δswc is the variation of soil water storage up to 90 cm depth where most of maize root system concentrated ren et al 2016 pc is the deep percolation to shallow groundwater because daily δswc sometimes was too small to accurately determine using hydra probe measurements the two days average was used to calculate the water balance besides it was assumed that either pc or etg was zero as discussed in the section 3 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological conditions and water regimes the observed meteorological conditions and et0 during two growing seasons are shown in fig 2 rs fluctuated significantly and its peaks values for both years were close to 340 w m 2 in june vpd ranged from 0 14 to 2 04 average 0 84 kpa and from 0 28 to 1 76 average 0 76 kpa in 2017 and 2018 respectively considering the similar variation in two years t rh increased from 8 3 23 to the peak 28 2 92 around august the averages of t and rh were 21 3 and 57 in 2017 and 20 7 and 61 in 2018 respectively the missing data for t rh and vpd in 2018 were due to data transmission failure daily et0 during the observation period varied from 0 68 to 7 77 mm with an average of 4 37 mm in 2017 and from 1 11 to 6 31 mm with an average of 4 22 mm in 2018 respectively it can be seen that et0 began to decrease significantly from the middle of august during both years the climate dynamic during two growing seasons was generally stable and typical for the north and northwest china zhang et al 2016 observed peak daily t around 25 in july over two irrigated maize fields in a desert oasis region and tian et al 2017 measured average weekly temperature ranging from about 15 30 in three consecutive years for a cotton field under drip irrigation in xinjiang northwestern china the seasonal variation in rs and vpd was in accordance with the observation in a semi arid shrubland in northern china by jia et al 2016 where rs and vpd reached their peaks values about 350 w m 2 and 2 0 kpa in june in the study area wtd below the soil surface is always shallower than 3 m ren et al 2016 the fluctuations of wtd and daily swc are shown in fig 3 three irrigations were applied on july 13 july 23 and aug 9 during the 2017 growing season and the total water irrigated was 396 mm the other one green bar on june 18 2017 represents the irrigation in the surrounding wheat field the growing season of wheat started earlier than maize and was from end of march to july xue and ren 2017 hence irrigation applied to wheat field caused the wtd rise at the beginning of the maize season in 2018 four irrigations were applied on june 2 june 19 july 9 and aug 5 respectively and the total irrigation amount was about 493 mm both swc and wtd fluctuated significantly along with irrigation wtd ranged from 0 64 to 2 26 m from soil surface with an average of 1 52 m in 2017 and varied from 0 64 to 2 17 m with an average of 1 76 m in 2018 3 2 canopy surface energy balance the linear regression between the sum of turbulent fluxes le h and the available energy rn gs shows the reliability of the ec data rodrigues et al 2014 tian et al 2017 using all the half hourly measurements the slopes of the regression equations are 0 732 r2 0 948 n 3714 and 0 634 r2 0 875 n 5559 for 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 4 a and c and similar to those reported in the literature hao et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 they are also within the range of 0 49 to 0 81 reported from chinaflux sites over various ecosystems li et al 2005 the energy imbalance phenomenon exists in the ec system liu et al 2011 pardo et al 2015 twine et al 2000 the half hourly le measured by the ec method le ec were compared with that λet br measured by the bowen ratio energy balance system installed in the same field perez et al 1999 shi et al 2008 fig 4b and d show that the regression slopes between them black crosses are 0 735 and 0 644 in 2017 and 2018 respectively it indicated that the initial le ec was much smaller than λet br in a maize field in northwest china half hourly daytime eta measured by the ec system is reported to be underestimated by 21 8 compared to that measured by lysimeters ding et al 2010 the imbalance can be attributed to comprehensive influences such as sampling errors soil and canopy missing storage terms and environmental conditions pardo et al 2015 in this research soil surface heat flux gs took the soil heat storage into consideration the canopy heat storage is considered to comprise a small proportion 5 of rn bezerra et al 2015 meyers and hollinger 2004 it may be due to the surrounding environment resulting in horizontal heat advection or missing turbulent capture which may have induced energy imbalance kool et al 2018 liu et al 2011 the forced energy balance closure using the β preservation of energy principle was adopted to offset the underestimated turbulent results anapalli et al 2018 this method has been proved to improve the le result of ec agreement with lysimetric result chavez et al 2009 ding et al 2010 after the energy forced closure process red squares the slopes between le ec and λet br were very close to 1 1 line r2 0 94 for both years thus the adjusted turbulent fluxes le and h were used in the following sections 3 3 seasonal and average diurnal variations of energy fluxes each energy component showed distinct seasonal variations for both years fig 5 daily average rn ranged from 12 2 220 9 w m 2 and 12 6 223 4 w m 2 with the average of 153 1 and 153 8 w m 2 for the studied period in 2017 and 2018 respectively the similar rn between two growing seasons indicated that energy received by maize canopy was generally stable le reached the maximum on july 8 and june 26 in 2017 and 2018 respectively when maize was at full canopy at the late jointing stage based on daily average data le accounted for 0 93 and 0 75 of rn in 2017 and 2018 respectively le being the main component of rn during the growing season agreed with previous researches in arid cropped areas suyker and verma 2008 le is comprised of more than 70 of rn over the cotton growth season in northwest of china tian et al 2017 and brazil bezerra et al 2015 for a winter wheat summer maize rotation cropland in the north china plain the proportion of le for wheat was much larger than maize indicating a higher water requirement of wheat lei and yang 2010 thus annual double cropping pattern of wheat maize is suggested to change to a single cropping of maize as a water saving measure shen et al 2013 seasonal variations of h and β showed an almost opposite trend to that of le they were much higher at the early stage before july and the maturity stage after august fig 5 than the middle growing season when they varied near zero most of the time the reverse seasonal changes in h and β could be attributed to crop growth status suyker and verma 2008 zhang et al 2016 for example le accounts for a large proportion of available energy during crop growing season while h dominates during the non growth season it seemed that crop canopy in the early growth stage and leaf senescence at the mature stage limited le in a semi arid shrubland with the sparse canopy in northern china h dominates during most of the year with an annual β of 2 0 jia et al 2016 daily gs was always stable and near zero due to the diurnal dynamic of the partial film mulching maize field shown in fig 6 below it is reported that partial plastic mulching reduced the evaporation increased soil heat flux and improved water use efficiency compared to no mulching for maize on the loess plateau of china feng et al 2017 gong et al 2017 the average diurnal energy fluxes indicated similar variations at different growth stages with an apparent peak around noon fig 6 rn was positive during the daytime and negative in the nighttime the average rn between two years were very close declining from 173 to 113 w m 2 in 2017 and from 170 to 115 w m 2 in 2018 while the peak values ranged from 656 8 511 7 w m 2 and 596 1 490 4 w m 2 in 2017 and 2018 respectively it indicated that the amplitude of diurnal rn in 2017 was larger than that in 2018 the lower rn peak in 2018 was likely because of the relatively drier surface conditions resulting from the deeper wtd fig 3 generally the diurnal dynamic of le also exhibited dominance of rn during the daytime fig 6 le increased gradually with rn and peaked between 13 00 and 14 00 and then decreased until about 20 00 the gradual increase of le along with rn in the morning implied crop biological characteristics of energy consumption with stomatal opening while for the same rn le in the afternoon was a slightly larger than that in the morning which can also be seen from the closer curves between le and rn in the afternoon diurnal h was positive during the morning and reached the peak earlier than that of rn and le then it decreased to below zero between 4 and 5 p m considering the energy partitioning the negative h in the afternoon implies a horizontal heat advection with drier air flowing from the surrounding areas which may increase le in the afternoon compared with that in the morning these observations are comparable to the results of timouk et al 2009 and kool et al 2018 irrigation promoting h advection from the surrounding drier soil surface has also been reported lei and yang 2010 zhang et al 2016 suyker and verma 2008 suggested that h advection occurs in the afternoon a few days after the irrigation this phenomenon was more evident at other stages than at maturity stage when irrigation had ceased the ratio of daytime energy components to rn at different stages is listed in table 1 for both years le rn was high at the heading and filling stages and low at the maturity stage h rn was the opposite to le rn the variation of gs rn was relatively stable and ranged from 6 to 15 while the values of le rn in 2017 were larger than that in 2018 and β in 2017 was smaller than that in 2018 these differences between two years was probably due to the shallower groundwater table in 2017 resulting in the higher le besides the experimental site in 2017 was surrounded by wheat which was harvested in mid july and fallow afterwards this may tend to cause a stronger h advection 3 4 factors influencing maize eta and energy fluxes 3 4 1 seasonal variations of eta et0 and lai et linking water energy and carbon exchange is determined by crop growth stage meteorological condition and water regimes fig 7 shows that the fluctuation of maize eta was very similar to that of et0 but with greater amplitude for both years eta reached the peak values between 7 4 and 8 6 mm d 1 at the rapid growth stage when lai increased fast during the middle growing season with full canopy coverage eta exceeded et0 with the leaf senescence both declined at the maturity stage the peak of daily eta was comparable to that in the irrigated maize fields of suyker and verma 2008 with the similar peak rn of about 210 w m 2 lai fitted curve showed the peaks of 6 2 m2 m 2 in 2017 and 7 2 m2 m 2 in 2018 respectively although total et0 of two seasons was very close with values around 450 mm the cumulative eta starting the jointing stage was 522 1 mm in 2017 much larger than 453 8 mm in 2018 table 2 implying that inter seasonal difference of crop eta is not determined by et0 eta between two growing seasons differed markedly during the middle growth stage with higher eta while the lower lai in 2017 compared to that in 2018 suyker and verma 2008 found that the variability in total seasonal sum eta connected well with the number of days when lai was larger than 3 m2 m 2 for irrigated maize and soybean however the total days under this condition for 2017 and 2018 were similar about 76 days fig 7 the inter seasonal variation of eta was likely due to the relationship between water supply and eta the relatively shallower groundwater in 2017 made crop water demand more easily satisfied another possibility could be that the field scale h advection further enhanced eta in 2017 maize field surrounded by the fallow land after wheat harvest lei and yang 2010 3 4 2 impact of lai irrigation and wtd on energy fluxes and eta the effect of crop growth characteristics on eta and energy fluxes can be expressed by kc and β as a function of lai fig 8 shows that kc increased to the peak of about 1 2 with increasing lai after lai exceeded about 4 m2 m 2 kc did not increase anymore we also found that lai had the same threshold above which β changed slightly and close to zero crop phenology significantly affected seasonal variation of energy fluxes and eta with a lai threshold during both years this threshold control of eta has been found in other researches suyker and verma 2008 zhang et al 2016 which can help to determine crop planting density and varieties facing scarce water resource for irrigation the average energy ratio of two days le rn and h rn before and after irrigation were compared in fig 9 le rn after irrigation increased by 7 and 8 for 2017 and 2018 respectively this was consistent with the result in zhang et al 2016 it can be concluded that irrigation slightly increased le rn because le was positively correlated to swc baldocchi et al 2004 increase in le and decrease in h after irrigations for 2018 were also consistent with the effect of irrigation on regional energy partitioning in arid areas jiang et al 2014 zeng et al 2017 while h rn increased after the irrigation on july 23 in 2017 which was likely due to the negative h prior to this irrigation considering the effect of lai on energy fluxes shown in fig 8 we discussed the relationship between le and β with wtd when lai was above 4 m2 m 2 in general wtd had a significant effect on energy fluxes fig 10 that when wtd declined from 1 2 to 2 1 m daily average β rose from 0 2 to 0 4 and le decreased from about 220 to 50 w m 2 the shallow wtd within this range was directly related to energy fluxes over maize canopy indicating the critical role of wtd in this agroecosystem the data outside the shaded area when wtd was shallower than 1 m were mainly from the days after irrigation resulting in the sharp rise of wtd 3 4 3 groundwater and soil water contributions to maize eta for calculating etg through the water balance eq 5 we need to clarify the water exchange whether affected by irrigation or not it can be seen that after irrigation both swc and wtd increased significantly fig 3 indicating that groundwater was recharged by irrigation seepage during this period it was inferred that etg was negligible and eta was completely supplied by the replenished soil water from irrigation in addition when there was no irrigation swc and wtd gradually declined thus pc was assumed to be zero and etg could be calculated from the equation then eta sources from shallow groundwater and soil water were obtained for the two growing seasons fig 11 in 2017 etg mainly concentrated at the jointing stage and the late stage moreover etg at the jointing stage was much larger than that at the late stage during july to early august eta mainly came from soil water storage and etg was small due to the frequent irrigations while the scattering of irrigation application in 2018 changed the distribution of groundwater and soil water consumptions during the relatively longer irrigation intervals when soil water storage could not satisfy eta requirement shallow groundwater began to supplement crop water use etg occurred about six days after irrigation in 2018 and it seemed to occur earlier about four days after irrigation in 2017 the groundwater contribution processes during the two seasons demonstrated that irrigation schedule determined the distribution of eta sources apart from shallow groundwater position for the observation period in 2017 104 days total etg was 189 71 mm and contributed to 36 3 of maize eta in 2018 111days 26 2 of maize eta was from groundwater 125 61 mm seasonal etg contribution in 2018 was less than that in 2017 and could be attributed to the deeper average wtd in 2018 which were on accord with gao et al 2017 and wang et al 2016 4 conclusions energy fluxes and water exchange over irrigated maize fields for two growing seasons were analyzed using the ec system in an arid area with shallow groundwater the slopes between rn g and le h were 0 732 and 0 634 for half hourly data in 2017 and 2018 respectively due to the energy imbalance of ec measurements le was adjusted by the β preservation principle and then very similar to that measured by bowen ratio energy balance system at the same site le dominated rn during the growing period both at daily and diurnal scales diurnal energy partitioning showed h in the afternoon declined faster than le and was even negative resulting from the h advection seasonal eta and energy fluxes was significantly affected by crop development with a lai threshold about 4 m2 m 2 given the similar et0 inter seasonal variability in total eta 522 1 mm in 2017 and 453 8 mm in 2018 was likely explained by the different water conditions as shallow groundwater exhibited a direct influence on energy fluxes that generally the increasing wtd reduced le and increased β shallow groundwater contributed to a significant part of crop eta in 2017 36 3 and 2018 26 2 and irrigation distribution could alter etg variation during the growing season with the shallower average wtd and intensive irrigations at mid season in 2017 etg mainly concentrated at the jointing stage and the later growth stage while etg in 2018 was scattered and occurred between two irrigations interval this research provides a better understanding of the energy fluxes and water exchange in arid areas with shallow groundwater it suggests that the reasonable control of irrigation and groundwater will benefit agricultural water productivity 5 declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

10805,precise estimations of energy fluxes and evapotranspiration for cropland in arid areas with shallow groundwater are necessary but limited there is also a need to better understand the contribution of groundwater for meeting crop water consumptive use in this study considering the environmental conditions such as meteorological variables crop growth and water regimes energy fluxes and actual evapotranspiration eta in an irrigated maize field with shallow groundwater were examined using eddy covariance system during two growing seasons due to the energy imbalance of the eddy covariance method latent heat le was adjusted using the bowen ratio preservation of energy principle and subsequently very close r2 0 94 to that measured by the bowen ratio energy balance system for seasonal and diurnal variations le accounted for the highest proportion of net radiation rn from the jointing stage while le rn was a little lower in 2018 than that in 2017 which may be because of the deeper groundwater table depth wtd in 2018 the negative sensible heat in the afternoon implied the occurrence of heat advection in the irrigated cropland energy fluxes and eta were significantly affected by crop development when leaf area index was less than about 4 m2 m 2 moreover the increasing wtd from 1 2 to 2 2 m decreased le by about 70 and increased daily average bowen ratio from the jointing stage total eta was 522 1 and 453 8 mm in 2017 and 2018 respectively the inter seasonal variation in eta was more dependent on water conditions than the potential evaporative demand the water balance result showed that average wtd of 1 52 and 1 76 m for the growing period contributed to 36 3 and 26 2 eta in 2017 and 2018 respectively besides daily groundwater contribution between two seasons was different because of the differences in irrigation allocation and wtd these results highlight the key effect of shallow groundwater to energy fluxes and water exchange of agroecosystem in arid areas keywords energy fluxes maize evapotranspiration groundwater contribution irrigation schedule eddy covariance 1 introduction energy fluxes and water vapor exchange are always of importance

carbon fluxes ultimately determine yield and water productivity shen et al 2013 the processes are always influenced by several interacting biophysical and environmental factors such as climate

agroecosystems anapalli et al 2018 bezerra et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 in arid areas where crop growth depends on supplemental irrigation due to the lack of rainfall et i e water exchange corresponding to le plays the most critical role in the hydrological cycle bezerra et al 2015 ding et al 2013 based on four years data of eddy covariance ec system shen et al 2013 concluded that for the irrigated cropland in north china plain water and energy balances are mainly influenced by the planting pattern and irrigation schedule and not the irrigation sources groundwater or surface water variations in et and energy fluxes are also closely related to crop growth status as the important energy fluxes components latent heat le is often the main contributor to the water loss during crop growing season while the proportion of sensible heat h increases during non growing period gao et al 2018b suyker and verma 2008 zhang et al 2016 knowledge of the seasonal and inter annual variability

the third largest irrigation district in china and an important food production area agriculture in the area almost entirely depends on irrigation water diverted from the yellow river which accounts for more than 90 of total water consumption xue and ren 2017 large volumes of flood irrigation withdrawal could reduce the stream flow of the yellow river and change agricultural production shen et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 new water saving strategies are being developed for sustainable water management in the irrigated corridors on a regional scale a decrease in water supply could affect groundwater table and crop water use chen et al 2018 various scenarios including irrigation schemes and groundwater depths are simulated to optimize groundwater water table depth wtd for stable transpiration ren et al 2018 or water productivity gao et al 2018a for field scale researches shallow groundwater contributed towards partially meeting crop water demands gao et al 2017 wang et al 2016 and to produce stable yield of rainfed maize in the us corn belt rizzo et al 2018 and the inland pampas in argentina nosetto et al 2009 for irrigated maize in arid areas it could be more complicated since irrigation can also change shallow groundwater depth there is an urgent need to untangle water exchange processes in cropland with shallow groundwater for better management of water resources and agricultural production to the best of our knowledge research on surface energy fluxes and actual evapotranspiration eta over irrigated cropland in arid areas with shallow groundwater is limited in this two years study these data were measured by the ec system providing necessary information for agricultural water management and water productivity improvement in similar areas the specific objectives were to 1 assess the variations of energy fluxes at both mean hourly and seasonal scales in irrigated maize fields in an arid area with shallow groundwater 2 evaluate the influencing factors of energy fluxes and maize eta such as crop growth and water regime and 3 quantify the changed groundwater contributions to maize eta with varying wtd and irrigation schedules 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this study was conducted in a cropland 107 39 e 41 09 n 1032 m altitude in hetao irrigation district with an area of 1 12 million ha fig 1 the area is located in the upper reaches of the yellow river northwest china where approximate 5 billion m3 water are diverted from the yellow river annually xu et al 2015 this area has a typical continental arid and semi arid climate the average annual 2000 2014 precipitation and potential evaporation are about 170 and 2300 mm respectively chen et al 2018 some related description of this district can be referred from ren et al 2018 and xue and ren 2017 maize is widely planted in the area because of high yield and drought tolerance in the experiment maize zeyu 19 was sown on may 12 2017 and on april 28 2018 and they were harvested at the end of september for both years the experimental maize field in 2018 is shown in fig 1 and all surrounded by maize the total area of maize was more than 10 ha the experimental field in 2017 about 1 ha was half of that in 2018 there are generally three or four irrigations applied to maize during the entire growing season the soil texture in the experimental area is mainly silt loam and silt clay loam within 1 m depth from the soil surface liu et al 2019 2 2 field measurements 2 2 1 meteorological crop growth and water conditions micrometeorological data such as solar radiation rs air temperature t relative humidity rh precipitation air pressure and wind speed were recorded at 30 min intervals using the automatic weather station kits hobo u30 onset computer corp usa near the experimental field at 2 m height regrading crop growth condition six plants were randomly chosen to measure green leaf area index lai about every ten days using a portable leaf area meter beijing yaxinliyi science and technology corp china every green leaf was scanned to obtain the total leaves area of each maize plant lai was calculated as the ratio of average green leaves area of plant m2 plant 1 to the planting density m2 plant 1 meanwhile the height of maize was also measured using a ruler and the maximum height could reach about 3 3 m soil sensors hydra probe stevens water monitoring system inc usa were installed to observe soil volumetric water content swc and soil temperature data were recorded at 1 h intervals and then averaged at daily scale soil samples at 10 30 50 70 and 90 cm were collected six times to determine gravimetric soil water contents using oven drying method ren et al 2016 schunk et al 2016 which was then used to calibrate daily average swc measured by hydra probe sensors groundwater table depth wtd was recorded at 0 5 h intervals by hobo water level logger u20 onset computer corp usa installed in a well in the center of the field 2 2 2 eddy covariance method the ec system produces a direct estimate of h and le fluxes and is widely used to measure energy and gas exchanges between the terrestrial ecosystem and atmosphere meyers and hollinger 2004 wolf et al 2008 the three dimensional csat3 sonic anemometer gill solent istruments uk with an open path infrared h2o co2 analyzer li 7500 li cor inc usa was located about 1 5 m above the maximum canopy height and the location was adjusted once during the maize growing period data were sampled at 10 hz and recorded at 30 min intervals using the cr3000 data logger data were post processed with the eddypro li cor software including spike detection frequency response corrections conversion of sonic temperature into actual temperature schotanus et al 1983 coordinate rotation using planar fit method and wpl webb pearman leuning density correction webb et al 1980 turbulent fluxes le and h and bowen ratio were calculated by the following equations 1 l e λ ρ a w q 2 h c p ρ a w t 3 β h l e where λ is the heat of water vaporization j kg 1 ρa is air density kg m 3 w q is the covariance between turbulent fluctuations of vertical wind speed w m s 1 and the scalar mixing

kipp zonen netherlands installed at the height of 1 m above the maximum canopy two hfp01 heat flux plates hukseflux netherlands were buried at about 6 cm below the soil surface to calculate soil surface heat flux gs with soil moisture cs616 soil moisture sensors and temperature tcav averaging soil thermocouple probe measurements one plate was in the middle of the two rows maize with film mulching and the other was in the bare soil between the row space the distance between them was about 60 cm in this study ec measurements were continuously carried out from about june to the end of september in 2017 and 2018 the observation field was also surrounded by maize field in 2018 fig 1 providing adequate fetch length for ec measurements the ec system fetch analysis indicated that about 90 of the flux originated within 100 m upwind of the tower and ne e wind is the predominant wind direction in this region while the field in 2017 with a narrow shape could be smaller than the fetch length in some directions 2 2 3 potential and actual evapotranspiration daily potential evapotranspiration et0 and vapor pressure deficit vpd were calculated from penman monteith method in fao 56 allen et al 1998 based on the meteorological observations at 2 m height the crop coefficient kc defined as the ratio of eta to et0 was obtained to character crop water consumption after excluding the potential evaporative demand daily equivalent maize eta was converted from daily measured le according to fao 56 allen et al 1998 and as follows 4 e t a l e λ ρ w where ρw is water density g cm 3 then groundwater contribution or groundwater evapotranspiration etg was calculated using the water balance equation 5 e t g p i δ s w c e t a p c where p and i are precipitation and irrigation respectively δswc is the variation of soil water storage up to 90 cm depth where most of maize root system concentrated ren et al 2016 pc is the deep percolation to shallow groundwater because daily δswc sometimes was too small to accurately determine using hydra probe measurements the two days average was used to calculate the water balance besides it was assumed that either pc or etg was zero as discussed in the section 3 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological conditions and water regimes the observed meteorological conditions and et0 during two growing seasons are shown in fig 2 rs fluctuated significantly and its peaks values for both years were close to 340 w m 2 in june vpd ranged from 0 14 to 2 04 average 0 84 kpa and from 0 28 to 1 76 average 0 76 kpa in 2017 and 2018 respectively considering the similar variation in two years t rh increased from 8 3 23 to the peak 28 2 92 around august the averages of t and rh were 21 3 and 57 in 2017 and 20 7 and 61 in 2018 respectively the missing data for t rh and vpd in 2018 were due to data transmission failure daily et0 during the observation period varied from 0 68 to 7 77 mm with an average of 4 37 mm in 2017 and from 1 11 to 6 31 mm with an average of 4 22 mm in 2018 respectively it can be seen that et0 began to decrease significantly from the middle of august during both years the climate dynamic during two growing seasons was generally stable and typical for the north and northwest china zhang et al 2016 observed peak daily t around 25 in july over two irrigated maize fields in a desert oasis region and tian et al 2017 measured average weekly temperature ranging from about 15 30 in three consecutive years for a cotton field under drip irrigation in xinjiang northwestern china the seasonal variation in rs and vpd was in accordance with the observation in a semi arid shrubland in northern china by jia et al 2016 where rs and vpd reached their peaks values about 350 w m 2 and 2 0 kpa in june in the study area wtd below the soil surface is always shallower than 3 m ren et al 2016 the fluctuations of wtd and daily swc are shown in fig 3 three irrigations were applied on july 13 july 23 and aug 9 during the 2017 growing season and the total water irrigated was 396 mm the other one green bar on june 18 2017 represents the irrigation in the surrounding wheat field the growing season of wheat started earlier than maize and was from end of march to july xue and ren 2017 hence irrigation applied to wheat field caused the wtd rise at the beginning of the maize season in 2018 four irrigations were applied on june 2 june 19 july 9 and aug 5 respectively and the total irrigation amount was about 493 mm both swc and wtd fluctuated significantly along with irrigation wtd ranged from 0 64 to 2 26 m from soil surface with an average of 1 52 m in 2017 and varied from 0 64 to 2 17 m with an average of 1 76 m in 2018 3 2 canopy surface energy balance the linear regression between the sum of turbulent fluxes le h and the available energy rn gs shows the reliability of the ec data rodrigues et al 2014 tian et al 2017 using all the half hourly measurements the slopes of the regression equations are 0 732 r2 0 948 n 3714 and 0 634 r2 0 875 n 5559 for 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 4 a and c and similar to those reported in the literature hao et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 they are also within the range of 0 49 to 0 81 reported from chinaflux sites over various ecosystems li et al 2005 the energy imbalance phenomenon exists in the ec system liu et al 2011 pardo et al 2015 twine et al 2000 the half hourly le measured by the ec method le ec were compared with that λet br measured by the bowen ratio energy balance system installed in the same field perez et al 1999 shi et al 2008 fig 4b and d show that the regression slopes between them black crosses are 0 735 and 0 644 in 2017 and 2018 respectively it indicated that the initial le ec was much smaller than λet br in a maize field in northwest china half hourly daytime eta measured by the ec system is reported to be underestimated by 21 8 compared to that measured by lysimeters ding et al 2010 the imbalance can be attributed to comprehensive influences such as sampling errors soil and canopy missing storage terms and environmental conditions pardo et al 2015 in this research soil surface heat flux gs took the soil heat storage into consideration the canopy heat storage is considered to comprise a small proportion 5 of rn bezerra et al 2015 meyers and hollinger 2004 it may be due to the surrounding environment resulting in horizontal heat advection or missing turbulent capture which may have induced energy imbalance kool et al 2018 liu et al 2011 the forced energy balance closure using the β preservation of energy principle was adopted to offset the underestimated turbulent results anapalli et al 2018 this method has been proved to improve the le result of ec agreement with lysimetric result chavez et al 2009 ding et al 2010 after the energy forced closure process red squares the slopes between le ec and λet br were very close to 1 1 line r2 0 94 for both years thus the adjusted turbulent fluxes le and h were used in the following sections 3 3 seasonal and average diurnal variations of energy fluxes each energy component showed distinct seasonal variations for both years fig 5 daily average rn ranged from 12 2 220 9 w m 2 and 12 6 223 4 w m 2 with the average of 153 1 and 153 8 w m 2 for the studied period in 2017 and 2018 respectively the similar rn between two growing seasons indicated that energy received by maize canopy was generally stable le reached the maximum on july 8 and june 26 in 2017 and 2018 respectively when maize was at full canopy at the late jointing stage based on daily average data le accounted for 0 93 and 0 75 of rn in 2017 and 2018 respectively le being the main component of rn during the growing season agreed with previous researches in arid cropped areas suyker and verma 2008 le is comprised of more than 70 of rn over the cotton growth season in northwest of china tian et al 2017 and brazil bezerra et al 2015 for a winter wheat summer maize rotation cropland in the north china plain the proportion of le for wheat was much larger than maize indicating a higher water requirement of wheat lei and yang 2010 thus annual double cropping pattern of wheat maize is suggested to change to a single cropping of maize as a water saving measure shen et al 2013 seasonal variations of h and β showed an almost opposite trend to that of le they were much higher at the early stage before july and the maturity stage after august fig 5 than the middle growing season when they varied near zero most of the time the reverse seasonal changes in h and β could be attributed to crop growth status suyker and verma 2008 zhang et al 2016 for example le accounts for a large proportion of available energy during crop growing season while h dominates during the non growth season it seemed that crop canopy in the early growth stage and leaf senescence at the mature stage limited le in a semi arid shrubland with the sparse canopy in northern china h dominates during most of the year with an annual β of 2 0 jia et al 2016 daily gs was always stable and near zero due to the diurnal dynamic of the partial film mulching maize field shown in fig 6 below it is reported that partial plastic mulching reduced the evaporation increased soil heat flux and improved water use efficiency compared to no mulching for maize on the loess plateau of china feng et al 2017 gong et al 2017 the average diurnal energy fluxes indicated similar variations at different growth stages with an apparent peak around noon fig 6 rn was positive during the daytime and negative in the nighttime the average rn between two years were very close declining from 173 to 113 w m 2 in 2017 and from 170 to 115 w m 2 in 2018 while the peak values ranged from 656 8 511 7 w m 2 and 596 1 490 4 w m 2 in 2017 and 2018 respectively it indicated that the amplitude of diurnal rn in 2017 was larger than that in 2018 the lower rn peak in 2018 was likely because of the relatively drier surface conditions resulting from the deeper wtd fig 3 generally the diurnal dynamic of le also exhibited dominance of rn during the daytime fig 6 le increased gradually with rn and peaked between 13 00 and 14 00 and then decreased until about 20 00 the gradual increase of le along with rn in the morning implied crop biological characteristics of energy consumption with stomatal opening while for the same rn le in the afternoon was a slightly larger than that in the morning which can also be seen from the closer curves between le and rn in the afternoon diurnal h was positive during the morning and reached the peak earlier than that of rn and le then it decreased to below zero between 4 and 5 p m considering the energy partitioning the negative h in the afternoon implies a horizontal heat advection with drier air flowing from the surrounding areas which may increase le in the afternoon compared with that in the morning these observations are comparable to the results of timouk et al 2009 and kool et al 2018 irrigation promoting h advection from the surrounding drier soil surface has also been reported lei and yang 2010 zhang et al 2016 suyker and verma 2008 suggested that h advection occurs in the afternoon a few days after the irrigation this phenomenon was more evident at other stages than at maturity stage when irrigation had ceased the ratio of daytime energy components to rn at different stages is listed in table 1 for both years le rn was high at the heading and filling stages and low at the maturity stage h rn was the opposite to le rn the variation of gs rn was relatively stable and ranged from 6 to 15 while the values of le rn in 2017 were larger than that in 2018 and β in 2017 was smaller than that in 2018 these differences between two years was probably due to the shallower groundwater table in 2017 resulting in the higher le besides the experimental site in 2017 was surrounded by wheat which was harvested in mid july and fallow afterwards this may tend to cause a stronger h advection 3 4 factors influencing maize eta and energy fluxes 3 4 1 seasonal variations of eta et0 and lai et linking water energy and carbon exchange is determined by crop growth stage meteorological condition and water regimes fig 7 shows that the fluctuation of maize eta was very similar to that of et0 but with greater amplitude for both years eta reached the peak values between 7 4 and 8 6 mm d 1 at the rapid growth stage when lai increased fast during the middle growing season with full canopy coverage eta exceeded et0 with the leaf senescence both declined at the maturity stage the peak of daily eta was comparable to that in the irrigated maize fields of suyker and verma 2008 with the similar peak rn of about 210 w m 2 lai fitted curve showed the peaks of 6 2 m2 m 2 in 2017 and 7 2 m2 m 2 in 2018 respectively although total et0 of two seasons was very close with values around 450 mm the cumulative eta starting the jointing stage was 522 1 mm in 2017 much larger than 453 8 mm in 2018 table 2 implying that inter seasonal difference of crop eta is not determined by et0 eta between two growing seasons differed markedly during the middle growth stage with higher eta while the lower lai in 2017 compared to that in 2018 suyker and verma 2008 found that the variability in total seasonal sum eta connected well with the number of days when lai was larger than 3 m2 m 2 for irrigated maize and soybean however the total days under this condition for 2017 and 2018 were similar about 76 days fig 7 the inter seasonal variation of eta was likely due to the relationship between water supply and eta the relatively shallower groundwater in 2017 made crop water demand more easily satisfied another possibility could be that the field scale h advection further enhanced eta in 2017 maize field surrounded by the fallow land after wheat harvest lei and yang 2010 3 4 2 impact of lai irrigation and wtd on energy fluxes and eta the effect of crop growth characteristics on eta and energy fluxes can be expressed by kc and β as a function of lai fig 8 shows that kc increased to the peak of about 1 2 with increasing lai after lai exceeded about 4 m2 m 2 kc did not increase anymore we also found that lai had the same threshold above which β changed slightly and close to zero crop phenology significantly affected seasonal variation of energy fluxes and eta with a lai threshold during both years this threshold control of eta has been found in other researches suyker and verma 2008 zhang et al 2016 which can help to determine crop planting density and varieties facing scarce water resource for irrigation the average energy ratio of two days le rn and h rn before and after irrigation were compared in fig 9 le rn after irrigation increased by 7 and 8 for 2017 and 2018 respectively this was consistent with the result in zhang et al 2016 it can be concluded that irrigation slightly increased le rn because le was positively correlated to swc baldocchi et al 2004 increase in le and decrease in h after irrigations for 2018 were also consistent with the effect of irrigation on regional energy partitioning in arid areas jiang et al 2014 zeng et al 2017 while h rn increased after the irrigation on july 23 in 2017 which was likely due to the negative h prior to this irrigation considering the effect of lai on energy fluxes shown in fig 8 we discussed the relationship between le and β with wtd when lai was above 4 m2 m 2 in general wtd had a significant effect on energy fluxes fig 10 that when wtd declined from 1 2 to 2 1 m daily average β rose from 0 2 to 0 4 and le decreased from about 220 to 50 w m 2 the shallow wtd within this range was directly related to energy fluxes over maize canopy indicating the critical role of wtd in this agroecosystem the data outside the shaded area when wtd was shallower than 1 m were mainly from the days after irrigation resulting in the sharp rise of wtd 3 4 3 groundwater and soil water contributions to maize eta for calculating etg through the water balance eq 5 we need to clarify the water exchange whether affected by irrigation or not it can be seen that after irrigation both swc and wtd increased significantly fig 3 indicating that groundwater was recharged by irrigation seepage during this period it was inferred that etg was negligible and eta was completely supplied by the replenished soil water from irrigation in addition when there was no irrigation swc and wtd gradually declined thus pc was assumed to be zero and etg could be calculated from the equation then eta sources from shallow groundwater and soil water were obtained for the two growing seasons fig 11 in 2017 etg mainly concentrated at the jointing stage and the late stage moreover etg at the jointing stage was much larger than that at the late stage during july to early august eta mainly came from soil water storage and etg was small due to the frequent irrigations while the scattering of irrigation application in 2018 changed the distribution of groundwater and soil water consumptions during the relatively longer irrigation intervals when soil water storage could not satisfy eta requirement shallow groundwater began to supplement crop water use etg occurred about six days after irrigation in 2018 and it seemed to occur earlier about four days after irrigation in 2017 the groundwater contribution processes during the two seasons demonstrated that irrigation schedule determined the distribution of eta sources apart from shallow groundwater position for the observation period in 2017 104 days total etg was 189 71 mm and contributed to 36 3 of maize eta in 2018 111days 26 2 of maize eta was from groundwater 125 61 mm seasonal etg contribution in 2018 was less than that in 2017 and could be attributed to the deeper average wtd in 2018 which were on accord with gao et al 2017 and wang et al 2016 4 conclusions energy fluxes and water exchange over irrigated maize fields for two growing seasons were analyzed using the ec system in an arid area with shallow groundwater the slopes between rn g and le h were 0 732 and 0 634 for half hourly data in 2017 and 2018 respectively due to the energy imbalance of ec measurements le was adjusted by the β preservation principle and then very similar to that measured by bowen ratio energy balance system at the same site le dominated rn during the growing period both at daily and diurnal scales diurnal energy partitioning showed h in the afternoon declined faster than le and was even negative resulting from the h advection seasonal eta and energy fluxes was significantly affected by crop development with a lai threshold about 4 m2 m 2 given the similar et0 inter seasonal variability in total eta 522 1 mm in 2017 and 453 8 mm in 2018 was likely explained by the different water conditions as shallow groundwater exhibited a direct influence on energy fluxes that generally the increasing wtd reduced le and increased β shallow groundwater contributed to a significant part of crop eta in 2017 36 3 and 2018 26 2 and irrigation distribution could alter etg variation during the growing season with the shallower average wtd and intensive irrigations at mid season in 2017 etg mainly concentrated at the jointing stage and the later growth stage while etg in 2018 was scattered and occurred between two irrigations interval this research provides a better understanding of the energy fluxes and water exchange in arid areas with shallow groundwater it suggests that the reasonable control of irrigation and groundwater will benefit agricultural water productivity 5 declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

10806,irrigation and nitrogen n fertilization play important roles in grain yield however amounts supplied in excess of crop demand are responsible for water and n leaching during intensive agricultural production a three year winter wheat triticum aestivum l summer maize zea mays l rotation experiment involving varied irrigation and n fertilization treatments was conducted in the jinghui canal irrigation area of guanzhong plain in china to develop a more sustainable agroecosystem taking into account crop yields deep percolation and n leaching the rzwqm2 model was used to simulate crop production various irrigation and n fertilization strategies were simulated to obtain high crop yields and to reduce water and n leaching in different precipitation years using long term historical weather data spanning 57 years 1961 2017 the simulated soil water and no3 n content grain yield water and nitrogen use efficiencies with nrmse values ranging from 5 3 25 1 and the simulated crop biomass and n uptake with re values ranging from 16 4 18 3 were in good agreement with observed data simulated lai values were acceptable with rmse ranging from 0 31 to 1 68 and index of agreement d ranging from 0 28 to 0 94 with the poorer simulations occurring with water and n stress maize seedling stage and wheat jointing stage were the phases most sensitive to water deficit and optimal irrigation schedules could be adjusted according to variable precipitation and other climate changes the best irrigation strategies for maize in the guanzhong plain were irrigation applied at the seedling stage in wet and normal years and two irrigations applied at the seedling and jointing stages in dry years the best irrigation strategies for wheat were two three and four irrigations applied in wet normal and dry years respectively irrigation at different crop growth stages significantly influenced n leaching and nitrogen use efficiency increasing n input led to greater water use efficiency and less deep percolation water considering the interactive effects of water and n input on yield deep percolation and n leaching the most appropriate n application rates in all precipitation years were 140 kg n ha 1 for maize and 240 kg n ha 1 for wheat coupled with the recommended irrigation strategies improving water and n management can significantly reduce deep percolation of water and n leaching while maintaining agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability keywords irrigation schedule deep percolation nitrogen leaching loss water use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency 1 introduction water is vital essential element for crop development and yield water scarcity has become a global systemic risk sun et al 2016 the total water resources of china are 2876 billion m3 accounting for 6 of global water resources agricultural water accounts for 62 3 of china s total water consumption and shows a decreasing trend ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2016 agricultural irrigation is the largest water consumer in china the insufficient water resource challenges the sustainability of conventional agricultural practices and is a major factor limiting agricultural production in china dadrasan et al 2015 kang et al 2017 this situation stresses the urgent need to identify reasonable irrigation management recommendations to improve crop water use efficiency wue and achieve reductions in deep percolation below the crop root zone while maintaining high grain yields meanwhile the influence of climate change and interannual variations of precipitation in time and space result in large fluctuations in annual crop water demand causing interannual changes in appropriate irrigation strategies in addition to water nitrogen is another important component affecting crop growth and yield wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015b from 1980 2012 the total consumption of n fertilizers in china increased by 158 from 9 3 24 0 million t yet total grain yield increased by only 70 yang et al 2017 the large use of n fertilizers substantially exceeded crop demand for n and did not significantly increase crop yields and n uptake leading to low n use efficiency cui et al 2010b li et al 2016 and potential environmental risks cui et al 2013b accumulation of no3 n in soil profile not absorbed by crops was serious and prevalent in wheat maize cropping system in china fang et al 2006 leading to very serious environmental risks such as n2o emissions from agricultural fields zhang et al 2013 soil degradation vashisht et al 2015 and groundwater contamination fang et al 2006 gu et al 2013 generally the need for food security and environmental protection is the paradox for n fertilizer use zhao et al 2006 showed a dramatically decreasing no3 n movement to deeper soil profile by optimizing n fertilization while keeping the higher grain yield thus a balancing between grain yield and the risk of n loss is a common aim for us liu et al 2018 however climate change and differences in soil types and other factors can lead to variations in management practices such as n application rates used and irrigation amounts applied in different regions ju et al 2004 wang et al 2017 concluded that appropriate n application rate for wheat production should be around 185 kg n ha 1 using data obtained from the literature and from field experiments and considering agricultural production and environmental impacts zhang et al 2015c recommended a reasonable n application rate for maize of 150 240 kg n ha 1 in the north china plain huang et al 2018 recommended seasonal n application rates of 190 and 150 kg n ha 1 for winter wheat and summer maize production respectively in china s huang huai hai plain in the guanzhong plain of china yang et al 2017 suggested proper n application rates for winter wheat and summer maize of 150 170 and 180 200 kg n ha 1 respectively in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system lü et al 2019 recommended 175 and 214 kg n ha 1 for wheat and maize which resulted in low environment stress and produced yields of 6799 and 7518 kg ha 1 respectively furthermore accumulation of no3 n in soil profile could be leached to deeper soil profile in conjunction with deep water percolation due to heavy precipitation in summer and unreasonable irrigation practices such as over flooding the implementation of appropriate n application rates coupled with reasonable irrigation schedules is essential for reducing deep percolation below the crop root zone and decreasing soil residual nitrate levels huang et al 2018 agricultural system models have been developed as tools to simulate crop responses to water and n treatments and to extend the results of field experiments to different soil types management practices and climate change ma et al 2001 for example the root zone water quality model 2 rzwqm2 version 2 10 2010 ahuja et al 2000 agricultural

simulation 1961 1999 with the rzwqm2 model by fang et al 2010 found that preseason irrigation of wheat should be delayed to the critical water requirement growth stage and that preseason irrigation for maize was needed in 40 of the years they also reported that an irrigation water ratio of 4 1 between wheat and maize could improve both water use efficiency wue and crop yield in the north china

water and n transport processes and nitrate leaching into groundwater over 10 years in a summer maize winter wheat rotation system in the north china plain jeong and bhattarai 2018 showed the need for accommodative n application rate as a result of the regional differences in agricultural systems and used rzwqm2 to determine best management practices for nitrogen applications focusing on rate time and placement however few studies have considered the effects of different precipitation years over the long term historical weather record on the productivity of the winter wheat summer maize rotation system widely used in china and the effects of deep percolation of irrigation water and n leaching on wheat and maize productivity in order to determine the optimal irrigation and n application rates also the differences in crop yields water and nitrogen use efficiency and water and n leaching due to various irrigation water amounts and n application rates have not been reported

region zhao et al 2018 it covers nearly 20 of the area of the province 34 000 km2 while provides more than 50 of the total food produced in the province yang et al 2017 the winter wheat summer maize rotation planting pattern is common in the region due to abundant solar radiation and optimal temperatures favorable for crop growth yang et al 2017 due to high potential evapotranspiration et precipitation is not sufficient to meet crop water requirements in this area and irrigation usually more than 75 mm becomes essential for agricultural production li et al 2013 xu et al 2019 in addition to this annual rainfall in the region mainly concentrated in august and september has over the past 50 years varied widely from 288 mm to 959 mm causing difficulties in precise agricultural irrigation management to obtain high yields in this region farmers usually use n fertilizers in amounts exceeding crop demand chang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015a high n inputs in conjunction with flood

summer maize cultivar wuke 2 grown from june to october and winter wheat cultivar xinong 979 grown from october to the following june winter wheat was planted in rows spaced 20 cm apart on 13 october

the common practice for this region of flood irrigation during the 2012 2013 wheat growing season we instituted different water treatments with 90 mm of irrigation applied at different growth stages different irrigation amounts 90 and 120 mm with different n application rates were applied during the 2013 2015 experimental period table 1 each treatment during 2012 2015 was replicated three times plots were 21 6 m 3 5 m and all experimental treatments were randomly assigned to the plots urea 46 n and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate fertilizer were used with half of the total n application

measure soil water content and no3 n concentration were collected at different crop growth periods before and after each irrigation and after precipitation three random locations in each plot were sampled and then mixed well to form one sample for each plot the samples were taken from the soil surface to a depth of 100 cm at 10 cm intervals and from 100 to 200 cm at 20 cm intervals using an auger the gravimetric soil water content was determined by oven drying at 105 c for 8 h soil volumetric water content was determined by multiplying the measured gravimetric soil water content by the soil bulk density measured by ring sampler at various soil depths soil no3 n concentration was measured by ultraviolet and indophenol blue colorimetry using an ev300pc ultraviolet spectrophotometer

uptake for winter wheat and summer maize by using spss statistics 22 0 https www ibm com analytics academic statistics software statistically significant comparisons were identified using least significant difference lsd tests 2 3 model calibration and validation we used the 2014 2015 experimental data set to calibrate the model and the remaining data from 2012 to 2014 for model validation ma et al 2003 recommended calibrating soil water first followed by soil n and crop growth the soil properties of each layer are listed in table 2 we measured the particle size distribution clay sand and silt percentages field capacity and permanent wilting point of soil the saturated hydraulic conductivity for each soil layer was estimated according to rawls et al 1982 then slightly adjusted manually to improve the simulation of soil water content then we calibrated the c n module of rzwqm2 according to ma et al 1998 and fang et al 2008 to establish the initial size of different c n pools in order to adjust the soil no3 n content after calibration of the soil parameters we calibrated the crop genetic coefficients for the ceres wheat and ceres maize crop models used within rzwqm2 using the measured grain yields biomass lai and n uptake the calibrated crop parameters are shown in table 3 to evaluate the accuracy of the simulation results for soil water content and soil no3 n content as well as crop production we used the root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nrmse mean relative error mre and index of agreement d parameters described in eq s 1 4 1 r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2

inconsistency in the model predictions and 0 indicating no agreement willmott 1982 2 4 model application after calibration and validation the model was applied to determine the reasonable irrigation and fertilization practices in the summer maize winter wheat rotation system using long term historical weather data 1961 2017 obtained from the national meteorological information center http data cma cn first the drought index di was calculated using the following equation 5 d i p m σ where p is the annual precipitation m is the average annual precipitation over the period 1961 2017 and σ is the standard error di is used to distinguish wet di 0 35 normal 0 35 di 0 35 and dry di 0 35 precipitation years guo et al 2012 in this study di for maize was calculated using the precipitation values for the summer maize growing season june to september and for the winter wheat growing season october to the next may for the experimental location then 15 wet years with average precipitation ap of 496 mm 21 normal years 333 mm ap and 20 dry years 228 mm ap for the maize growing season and 19 wet years 303 mm ap 15 normal years 232 mm ap and 22 dry years 168 mm ap for the wheat growing season were obtained the monthly precipitation in dry normal and wet years is shown in fig 1 the entire summer maize growing season was divided into seedling jointing jointing tasseling tasseling filling and filling ripening periods and the wheat growing season was divided into tillering jointing jointing boot boot filling and filling ripening periods based on the meteorological data of different precipitation years 16 scenarios of irrigation treatments were designed with 90 mm applied at various growth stages of each crop table 4 one treatment was a no irrigation rainfed treatment s1 four treatments consisted of one irrigation application s2 s5 six treatments consisted of two irrigation applications s6 s11 four treatments consisted of three irrigation applications s12 s15 the final treatment was four irrigation applications s16 the effects of these treatments varying in amount and timing of applied irrigation on grain yields deep percolation below the 120 cm soil depth wue iwue nue and n leaching were determined in order to identify reasonable irrigation strategies in different precipitation years the grain yield deep percolation and n leaching values were simulated using the rzwqm2 model the wue and iwue parameters were determined as follows the wue kg m 3 was calculated as grain yield y divided by evapotranspiration et during the growing season 6 w u e y 10 e t the iwue was calculated as the ratio of the difference between irrigated yield and average rainfed yield δy and applied irrigation i 7 i w u e δ y i the nue kg kg 1 was calculated as crop yield produced per unit of n fertilizer absorbed by crops nuptake 8 n u e y n u p t a k e finally we intentionally removed the irrigation treatments that had little effect on yields and wue but could cause greater deep percolation under the same irrigation amount we analyzed the response of crop yields n leaching deep percolation and wue to different n inputs from 0 to 240 kg n ha 1 for maize and from 0 to 300 kg n ha 1 for wheat under four water input levels with 0 mm 90 mm seedling stage 180 mm seedling jointing stage and 270 mm seedling jointing tasseling stage for maize and 90 mm jointing stage 180 mm jointing boot stage 270 mm jointing boot filling stage and 360 mm tillering jointing boot filling stage for wheat to evaluate the effect of the n application rate and interactive effects of water and n input on yield n leaching deep percolation and wue in order to identify the appropriate irrigation and n fertilization management in different precipitation years 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation 3 1 1 soil water content fig 2 shows the simulated and measured soil water contents in eight soil layers of the i1n2 treatment during the maize and wheat growing seasons in 2014 and 2015 the predictions of soil water content were good rmse 0 016 0 039 nrmse 5 7 14 2 for all soil depths except for the top depth 20 cm rmse 0 059 nrmse 21 6 in particular the simulated values agreed well with the measured values d 0 6 except for the 160 cm depth the simulated water contents at the top soil depth showed a poorer match with the measured data than those at deeper depths this result was consistent with the findings of yu et al 2006 hu et al 2006 and fang et al 2008 for the north china plain the main reason for this discrepancy was that water dynamics in the surface soil layer are more complex than in deeper soil layers because of high temporal variations in porosity conductivity and other properties hu et al 2006 which causes greater model uncertainty associated with soil parameter and processes in addition the discrepancy may also be due to error in the measured soil volumetric water content which was calculated from the measured gravimetric soil water content and the soil bulk density bulk density changes in response to the cultivation irrigation and precipitation conditions cai et al 2016 xu et al 2019 furthermore the soil water contents in the 0 80 cm layers changed more drastically in the summer maize than in the winter wheat growing period this was because more than 55 of the precipitation during the measurement period occurred during the maize growing period as shown in fig 3 a the simulated total profile 0 200 cm soil water storage for different n fertilization treatments was simulated with excellent accuracy rmse 4 51 5 25 cm nrmse 8 0 9 4 and the simulated results were in good agreement with the measured values d 0 65 0 71 the predicted and measured soil water contents obtained for the model validation data sets in the wheat maize rotation system from 2012 to 2014 are shown in fig 4 the rmse and nrmse values ranged from 2 84 to 5 52 cm and 5 3 10 2 respectively for different irrigation treatments during 2012 2013 and were comparable to the rmse and nrmse results obtained from the model calibration the values of d ranged from 0 71 to 0 96 with similar trends shown by the simulated and measured soil water values the accuracy of the simulation results for the 2013 2014 period was good nrmse 10 8 16 6 and most simulated values agreed well with the measured values d 0 55 0 75 except those corresponding to the w9n0 treatment d 0 39 3 1 2 soil no3 n content fig 5 shows the simulated and measured soil no3 n concentrations at different times during the maize and wheat growing seasons of 2014 2015 in different soil layers of the i1n2 treatment the simulated soil no3 n concentrations showed reasonable agreement with the measured values rmse 3 14 6 82 mg kg 1 and mre 19 9 1 6 a continuous downward movement of no3 n occurred in the 0 200 cm soil profile during the maize wheat rotation nitrate mainly accumulated in soil layers between 20 and 60 cm with a peak at 40 cm on 10 august in contrast after maize harvest on 12 october nitrate accumulated in soil layers between 60 and 120 cm with a peak at 80 cm during the subsequent wheat growing season some additional nitrate continued to move downward to depths below 120 cm in response to rain and several irrigation events and accumulated in the 130 160 cm layer by the wheat harvest date this no3 n fraction that accumulated below 120 cm would be difficult to be used by crops and poses a high risk of leaching into much deeper soil layers as shown in fig 3b the simulated total no3 n contents in the 0 200 cm soil profile for all n treatments were in reasonable agreement with the measured profile no3 n content the rmse values ranged from 70 0 92 1 kg ha 1 slightly larger than the value of 50 4 kg ha 1 in the 0 100 cm profile reported by fang et al 2008 for the north china plain however the accuracy of the simulated results was still good nrmse 11 9 19 0 the d values ranged from 0 70 to 0 82 denoting similar trends between the simulated and measured soil no3 n content significant variation in no3 n distribution in 0 200 cm soil profile was observed among the different n treatments and increased no3 n storage was observed with increasing n fertilization especially for the treatment with 360 kg n ha 1 applied per crop similar to the calibration results observed in 2014 2015 the validation results of the wheat maize rotation system subjected to different treatments during the 2013 2014 growing season were of good accuracy rmse 75 62 95 87 kg ha 1 and nrmse 12 9 18 9 and in good agreement with the measured values d 0 56 0 82 fig 6 the present results revealed an increase in both the simulated and measured soil no3 n content after crop harvest no3 n residue nr figs 3b and 6 in the 0 200 cm soil profile for n application rates above 120 kg n ha 1 for maize and 240 kg n ha 1 for wheat the nr of treatments with 120 kg n ha 1 for maize and 240 kg n ha 1 for wheat remained approximately unchanged denoting the correct n balance the nr was observed in soil after crop harvest especially for maize crops even when no n was applied this could be attributed to amounts of n left in deeper layers before maize was planted that could not be utilized by the crop in addition precipitation and mineralization of organic n could be crucial sources of soil n under these conditions dai et al 2015 reported the same observation in the loess plateau of china the soil nr values were above 400 kg n ha 1 before we planted maize in the experimental area due to higher n applied by the local farmers of the region 3 1 3 plant growth the simulated values of aboveground biomass were underestimated for both maize mre 5 4 and wheat mre 10 9 during the 2014 2015 crop seasons the relative errors ranged from 14 3 18 3 for maize and 16 4 to 0 1 for wheat table 5 simulated maize grain yield was overestimated by 6 5 whereas wheat grain yield was underestimated by 1 7 with relative errors ranging from 1 3 15 4 for maize and 11 1 10 4 for wheat the simulated aboveground n uptake deviated from the observed values by 5 8 for maize and 1 5 for wheat the corresponding relative errors for maize and wheat ranged from 1 3 11 0 and 11 6 7 1 respectively the biomass crop yield and aboveground n uptake values for maize and wheat were at their minimum when n application rate was 0 kg n ha 1 and they did not significantly increase p 0 05 with increasing n fertilizer inputs from 120 to 360 kg n ha 1 indicating the absence of significant effects on maize growth once the n application rate was above 120 kg n ha 1 similarly wheat grain yield did not significantly increase p 0 05 with increasing n fertilizer inputs from 120 to 360 kg n ha 1 for both high and low irrigation treatments indicating that over fertilization 120 kg n ha 1 did not significantly increase grain yields however we found no significant effect of the irrigation treatment on wheat biomass grain yield or aboveground n uptake although higher values were obtained for high irrigation treatments in particular the aboveground n uptake values of maize and wheat remained high when n application rate was 0 kg n ha 1 due to high levels of n mineralization fang et al 2006 and high soil nitrate accumulation fig 3b so that farmers do not need to apply n fertilizers before planting crops cui et al 2010a fig 7 shows the simulated and observed values of maize lai during the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons and of wheat lai during the 2012 2013 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 growing seasons the observed and simulated maize lai followed similar trends over time with rmse and d values ranging from 0 31 to 0 57 and from 0 71 to 0 91 respectively wheat lai during the 2012 2015 period was best predicted during the 2014 2015 season rmse 0 54 1 2 d 0 62 0 94 whereas the wheat lai predictions for the other two years were slightly poorer rmse 0 79 1 68 d 0 51 0 86 in 2013 2014 and rmse 0 97 1 58 d 0 28 0 87 in 2012 2013 overall lai values simulated by rzwqm2 model were acceptable but results under water and n stress were not good the underestimated lai values of the w9n240 and w9n120 treatments in 2013 2014 and of the w4 and w1 treatments in 2012 2013 were considered to be the main sources of error in the simulated values and this result was in agreement with previous studies dejonge et al 2011 fang et al 2009 song et al 2015 fig 8 shows the simulated and observed wheat and maize grain yields for different irrigation and n fertilization treatments in the wheat maize rotation system from 2012 to 2015 measured wheat yields for the different treatments in the 2012 2013 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 growing seasons ranged from 5274 to 7906 kg ha 1 simulation results were in good agreement with the measured data rmse 711 3 kg ha 1 nrmse 11 1 r 2 0 76 and d 0 87 similarly measured maize yields for the different treatments ranged from 5850 to 7120 kg ha 1 during the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 growing seasons with excellent agreement between simulated and measured values rmse 473 9 kg ha 1 nrmse 7 2 r 2 0 34 and d 0 72 3 2 characteristics of et wue deep percolation nue plant n uptake and n leaching table 6 shows the simulated and observed wue and nue values along with the simulated et deep percolation n leaching and plant n uptake results obtained for the wheat maize rotation system under different irrigation and n fertilization treatments during 2012 2015 the simulated wue of maize was in close agreement with the observed values and the accuracy of the simulated results was good nrmse 10 2 14 7 during the growing seasons of 2013 and 2014 however the accuracy of the corresponding model predictions obtained for wheat varied from excellent in 2014 2015 nrmse 7 7 to fair in 2013 2014 nrmse 25 1 and 2012 2013 nrmse 23 1 the wue values were underestimated for the w12n240 and w12n120 treatments in 2013 2014 and for the w6 treatment in 2012 2013 one possible reason was that simulated yields were a little higher than measured another possible reason was that there may have been some field sampling errors for these treatments these two reasons were considered the main sources of error in the model predictions the wue of both maize and wheat increased with increasing n application rate due to the increase in grain yield and water use ji et al 2014 similarly there was excellent agreement between the simulated and observed maize nue values during the 2014 nrmse 3 3 and 2015 5 7 growing seasons as for the wheat nue values the accuracy of the simulation results was excellent for 2014 2015 nrmse 5 3 and good for 2013 2014 nrmse 19 9 the nue for wheat appeared to decrease with increasing n application rate evapotranspiration increased with increasing irrigation amount for both maize and wheat table 6 for the same total water amount the irrigation treatment applied during the wheat regreening jointing period led to a significantly increased et w4 w3 w5 during the 2012 2013 wheat growing season the n application rate had no significant p 0 05 effect on the et of maize or wheat when it was above 120 kg ha 1 precipitation and irrigation significantly affected the amount of deep percolation below the root zone deep percolation increased with increasing irrigation amount for both maize and wheat during 2013 2014 deep percolation increased significantly as irrigation amount increased from 90 to 120 mm indicating that the irrigation amount had a significant effect on water movement in the soil profile irrigation at the winter tillering stage w3 and w5 significantly increased the deep percolation for the same irrigation amount w5 w4 and w3 during 2012 2013 table 6 mainly because wheat consumed less water during the seedling period and the soil water content remained higher for a long time after the irrigation causing larger amounts of deep percolation 58 mm for w5 and 60 mm for w3 deep percolation ranged from 81 mm to 139 mm for all treatments during the 2014 2015 wheat growing season which was greater than observed in other years when deep percolation ranged from 11 to 60 mm this was mainly due to high precipitation after irrigation was applied at the jointing stage causing large amounts of deep percolation similarly the n leaching amounts increased with increasing deep percolation and n application rate and showed marked interannual differences 3 3 irrigation and nitrogen management 3 3 1 response to irrigation management for different precipitation years maize yields did not show much difference in response to varied irrigation management in wet 6930 7683 kg ha 1 and normal years 7595 8809 kg ha 1 figs 9 a1 and b1 maize yields in wet and normal years decreased by an average 8 5 and 12 7 p 0 05 respectively under the rainfed condition s1 precipitation during the maize season was mainly concentrated in july august and september in the wet years 496 mm and normal years 333 mm fig 1 thus irrigation at the seedling stage was the key to achieving high maize yields and the greatest values of iwue in wet and normal years figs 9a4 and b4 were seen with irrigation at the seedling stage in dry years maize yields decreased on average by 38 7 under the rainfed condition and showed more drastic fluctuations to different irrigation treatments fig 9c1 a single irrigation could not produce a high maize yield although it could result in a large iwue if the irrigation occurred at the seedling or jointing stage figs 9c4 if two irrigations could be applied to maize they should be applied at the seedling and jointing stages to ensure higher yields in dry years irrigating at the maize grain filling stage led to the lowest iwue and did not significantly p 0 05 increase production compared with rainfed yields for all the precipitation years this was partially because more rainfall occurred in the maize grain filling stage and that rainfall was enough to meet the crop water demand another reason could be that maize yields were significantly decreased when maize was subjected to water stress at early growth stages when higher temperature and drought conditions are frequent in dry years song et al 2016 deep percolation during maize growth significantly p 0 05 increased with increasing irrigation water due to the fact that total water input was much greater than crop water requirement under high levels of irrigation figs 9a2 b2 and c2 greater values of deep percolation were achieved by irrigating during the maize seedling stage in normal and dry years s2 s3 s4 s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10 s11 s12 s13 s14 s15 mainly because less than 90 mm water was used by maize and the remaining soil water percolated out of the root zone deep percolation is a vital component of the water balance in hydrologic processes xu et al 2017 and can also contribute to n loss through leaching and runoff bouman et al 2007 sato et al 2009 in our study n leaching amount was strongly correlated with deep percolation demonstrating that changes in n leaching were consistent with changes in deep percolation wue and nue responses to irrigation were similar to yield responses to irrigation i e not significant in wet and normal years due to relatively abundant precipitation and ranged from 2 32 2 48 kg m 3 for wue and 45 9 47 9 for nue in wet years figs 9a3 and a6 and 2 43 2 65 kg m 3 for wue and 47 6 50 4 for nue in normal years figs 9b3 and b6 in dry years wue values exhibited a much different response to varied irrigation management fig 9c3 showing the same change trend as observed for maize yield results showed that irrigating in the maize seedling and jointing stages could significantly increase grain yield and wue in dry years of the guanzhong plain similar results were obtained by chen et al 2011 in our study total amount of irrigation had no significant p 0 05 effect on nue but irrigation time had a great influence on nue irrigating at the maize jointing and boot stages could significantly p 0 05 increase nue fig 9c6 because adequate water at the jointing and boot stages could increase n accumulation and n distribution ratio in stem and leaves thus benefitting n assimilation and absorption by maize in later stages miao et al 2011 simulated wheat yields showed greater responses to different irrigation treatments than maize yields for all precipitation years figs 10 a1 b1 and c1 it was more difficult to meet the wheat water requirement due to the lower rainfall during the wheat growing seasons average 303 mm for wet years 232 mm for normal years and 168 mm for dry years rainfed wheat yields averaged 5110 3963 and 2776 kg ha 1 in wet normal and dry years respectively and were reduced by 37 9 57 10 and 72 5 compared with yields under adequate irrigation conditions irrigation at the jointing stage for all precipitation years could increase wheat yields significantly p 0 05 and produced the highest iwue 2 87 kg m 3 for wet 3 07 kg m 3 for normal 2 82 kg m 3 for dry years figs 10a4 b4 and c4 indicating that the jointing stage was the critical wheat growth stage for irrigation in the guanzhong plain results were similar to those presented by zheng et al 2016 who concluded that the wheat jointing phase was the most sensitive phase to water deficit followed by the anthesis phase and zhou et al 2018 who found irrigation applied at the wheat jointing stage could significant increase wheat yield to avoid significantly lower wheat yields two irrigations during the jointing boot and boot filling stages were necessary to meet the water demand of wheat in wet years during normal precipitation years three irrigations during the jointing boot boot filling and filling ripening stages are recommended while in dry years four irrigations are recommended deep percolation during wheat growth exhibited consistent trends in all precipitation years figs 10a2 b2 and c2 greater values of deep percolation were produced by irrigating during the wheat tillering jointing period s2 s3 s4 s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10 s11 s12 s13 s14 s15 this greater deep percolation was probably because the combination of excess water stored in the soil and irrigation water was far beyond the wheat water requirement during that period of time resulting in a higher potential risk of percolation out of the root zone similarly to what was observed during the maize growing season the trend of n leaching amounts was consistently and strongly related to deep percolation amounts during the wheat growing season there was no significant difference p 0 05 in the amount of n leaching in different precipitation years in particular greater values of n leaching with irrigation during the wheat tillering jointing period were caused by simultaneous influence of greater amounts of deep percolation and greater fertilization applied during the period wue values for wheat showed differing responses to varied irrigation management in wet years 1 56 2 00 kg ha 1 m 3 normal years 1 36 2 10 kg ha 1 m 3 and dry years 1 11 2 08 kg ha 1 m 3 and the change trend was consistent with the change trend observed for wheat yield figs 10a3 b3 and c3 irrigating during the jointing boot and boot filling growth stages improved wheat wue in our study mostly because irrigation at the jointing and boot stages corresponded to pre and post anthesis water consumption optimized the canopy structure and ensured wheat physiological water demand post anthesis all of which was beneficial for improving grain yield and wue xu et al 2018 similarly to results observed for maize nue values were little influenced by total irrigation amount but irrigation date had a much greater influence on nue figs 10a6 b6 and c6 it appeared that irrigating during the boot filling and filling ripening stages could increase nue significantly p 0 05 while irrigating during the jointing boot stage could decrease nue adequate water supply in the jointing stage could promote wheat vegetative growth and negative affect the nitrogen absorption by grain while irrigation in the reproductive growth stage of winter wheat could improve the nitrogen absorption by grains meng et al 2016 3 3 2 interactive effects of irrigation and nitrogen management average simulated summer maize yields figs 11 a1 d1 in all three precipitation year categories were affected by the n application rate yields initially increased sharply with increasing n application rate and then increased more slowly once n application rate reached a certain value this type of response is well described by a linear plus plateau model liu et al 2016 yang et al 2017 in wet and normal years as previously discussed due to abundant precipitation n application rate became the main factor affecting maize yields increasing irrigation and nitrogen application amounts did not significantly p 0 05 increase maize yields when irrigation amount was greater than 90 mm and the interaction effect of irrigation and nitrogen on yield was not significant under the non irrigated condition in dry years average maize yield increased significantly p 0 05 to 3555 kg ha 1 as n application rate increased from 0 to 60 kg n ha 1 but there was no significant difference p 0 05 in yield for n application rates greater than 60 kg n ha 1 when irrigation amounts of 90 180 and 270 mm were applied average maize yield increased significantly p 0 05 to 5796 7393 and 7499 kg ha 1 as n application rate increased from 0 to 120 kg n ha 1 0 140 kg n ha 1 and 0 140 kg n ha 1 respectively and no significant increases in yield were seen as n application rate increase above those values similar results were simulated for wheat figs 12 a1 d1 and the highest grain yields were obtained with high irrigation amounts and high n application rates in dry years the critical n application rates were 200 220 240 and 260 kg n ha 1 with 90 180 270 and 360 mm irrigation applied respectively wheat yields increased significantly p 0 05 to 4716 6610 7772 and 9106 kg ha 1 as n application rate increased to the critical values similar results were found in wet and normal years results indicated that water input promoted the absorption and utilization of nitrogen by crops therefore n fertilizer application rate should be adjusted according to water conditions experienced by the crop wue values for maize and wheat were mainly affected by yields and total evapotranspiration xu et al 2018 maize wue figs 11a4 d4 and wheat wue figs 12a4 d4 increased with increasing n application rate which showed that changes in wue were consistent with changes in crop yields results indicated that n fertilizer input could increase both crop growth and evapotranspiration but had a greater influence on increasing crop yields thus increasing wue for a given n fertilizer application rate wheat wue showed an increasing trend p 0 05 as irrigation amount increases in dry years for example with 240 kg n ha 1 applied wue increased from 1 53 kg m 3 to 1 75 1 83 and 1 90 kg m 3 as irrigation increased from 90 to 360 mm in contrast wue showed a slightly decreasing trend with the increasing irrigation amount for maize in wet and normal years and for wheat in wet years for example with 140 kg n ha 1 applied to maize in normal years wue decreased from 2 42 kg m 3 to 2 40 2 35 and 2 32 kg m 3 as irrigation increased from 90 to 270 mm considering that increased n application rate increases wue farmers should avoid unreasonable applications of irrigation that would reduce wue the n application rate is the main factor affecting n leaching with n leaching values increasing with increasing n fertilizer application rate zhang et al 2015c wang et al 2017 in our study simulated n leaching clearly increased with increasing n application rate for both maize figs 11 a2 d2 and wheat figs 12a2 d2 in contrast to the yield response observed for increasing n application we found that n leaching for both maize and wheat increased slowly initially as n application rate increased and then increased more sharply with further increases in n application rate for example with 90 mm of irrigation applied to summer maize in wet years fig 11b2 average n leaching increased from 3 4 6 9 kg ha 1 as n application rate increased from 0 to 120 kg ha 1 then as n application rate increased from 120 to 240 kg n ha 1 n leaching increased sharply from 6 9 30 5 kg ha 1 the main reason for this result was that nitrogen absorption by crops reaches a maximum value at the point where n amount exceeds a critical value causing more and more nitrogen to be stored in the soil resulting in much greater n leaching similarly n leaching increased as water input increased and deep percolation increased for maize figs 11a3 d3 and wheat figs 12a3 d3 previous studies reported that increasing irrigation significantly increased deep percolation and nitrate leaching li et al 2015 in our study deep percolation increased with increasing irrigation amounts for both maize and wheat deep percolation in wheat increased from 14 to 80 mm as irrigation increased from 90 to 360 mm with the 240 kg n ha 1 application rate in dry years furthermore deep percolation in wheat decreased with increasing n application rate for example deep percolation decreased from 75 to 23 mm for wheat in dry years when n application rate increased from 0 to 300 kg n ha 1 with the 180 mm irrigation amount fig 12b3 this finding was probably due to the higher n application rate promoting crop growth thus increasing crop water consumption and thus reducing the amount of deep percolation identifying reasonable irrigation and fertilization is of great importance for obtaining higher grain yields with lower environmental risks yang et al 2017 excessive n fertilization does not result in significant increases in yield but leads to wasted resources and increased environmental risks chen et al 2014 cui et al 2013b jeong and bhattarai 2018 one of the most important risk factors is leached no3 n which could contaminate groundwater and cause water eutrophication gu et al 2013 le et al 2010 understanding the balance between the effects of n fertilization and irrigation on deep percolation n leaching wue and grain yields under different precipitation regimes is thus a crucial task the present simulation results suggest that 140 kg n ha 1 fertilizer application rate coupled with 90 mm irrigation amount in wet and normal years and 140 kg n ha 1 fertilizer rate coupled with 180 mm irrigation amount in dry years were optimal strategies for maize and 240 kg n ha 1 fertilizer application rate coupled with 180 270 and 360 mm irrigation amount in wet normal and dry years respectively were appropriate irrigation and nitrogen management for wheat 4 conclusions an appropriate n application rate coupled with suitable irrigation schedules should be implemented to obtain high grain yields while reducing deep percolation and n leaching in the intensively cropped farming practice of the maize wheat rotation system in china the present simulation results obtained with a calibrated rzwqm2 model for different precipitation years from 1961 to 2017 showed that higher irrigation and n application rates could produce higher yields however these management practices could also result in lower wue iwue and nue values along with significant deep percolation of water and n leaching identifying reasonable irrigation schedules and n application rates could increase wue iwue and nue values along with considerably reducing deep percolation and n leaching while maintaining high grain yields the optimal irrigation recommendations determined in this study could be adjusted according to variations in precipitation years and climate change especially for wheat growth irrigation and rainfall promote the absorption and utilization of nitrogen by crops and n fertilizer application rate should be adjusted according to variations in water availability to crops considering grain yields and environmental effects reasonable n application rates for summer maize and winter wheat in the guanzhong plain of china were estimated to be 140 and 240 kg n ha 1 respectively when coupled with recommended irrigation management in different precipitation years these rates resulted in a considerable reduction in n loss with only slightly lower grain production

10806,irrigation and nitrogen n fertilization play important roles in grain yield however amounts supplied in excess of crop demand are responsible for water and n leaching during intensive agricultural production a three year winter wheat triticum aestivum l summer maize zea mays l rotation experiment involving varied irrigation and n fertilization treatments was conducted in the jinghui canal irrigation area of guanzhong plain in china to develop a more sustainable agroecosystem taking into account crop yields deep percolation and n leaching the rzwqm2 model was used to simulate crop production various irrigation and n fertilization strategies were simulated to obtain high crop yields and to reduce water and n leaching in different precipitation years using long term historical weather data spanning 57 years 1961 2017 the simulated soil water and no3 n content grain yield water and nitrogen use efficiencies with nrmse values ranging from 5 3 25 1 and the simulated crop biomass and n uptake with re values ranging from 16 4 18 3 were in good agreement with observed data simulated lai values were acceptable with rmse ranging from 0 31 to 1 68 and index of agreement d ranging from 0 28 to 0 94 with the poorer simulations occurring with water and n stress maize seedling stage and wheat jointing stage were the phases most sensitive to water deficit and optimal irrigation schedules could be adjusted according to variable precipitation and other climate changes the best irrigation strategies for maize in the guanzhong plain were irrigation applied at the seedling stage in wet and normal years and two irrigations applied at the seedling and jointing stages in dry years the best irrigation strategies for wheat were two three and four irrigations applied in wet normal and dry years respectively irrigation at different crop growth stages significantly influenced n leaching and nitrogen use efficiency increasing n input led to greater water use efficiency and less deep percolation water considering the interactive effects of water and n input on yield deep percolation and n leaching the most appropriate n application rates in all precipitation years were 140 kg n ha 1 for maize and 240 kg n ha 1 for wheat coupled with the recommended irrigation strategies improving water and n management can significantly reduce deep percolation of water and n leaching while maintaining agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability keywords irrigation schedule deep percolation nitrogen leaching loss water use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency 1 introduction water is vital essential element for crop development and yield water scarcity has become a global systemic risk sun et al 2016 the total water resources of china are 2876 billion m3 accounting for 6 of global water resources agricultural water accounts for 62 3 of china s total water consumption and shows a decreasing trend ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2016 agricultural irrigation is the largest water consumer in china the insufficient water resource challenges the sustainability of conventional agricultural practices and is a major factor limiting agricultural production in china dadrasan et al 2015 kang et al 2017 this situation stresses the urgent need to identify reasonable irrigation management recommendations to improve crop water use efficiency wue and achieve reductions in deep percolation below the crop root zone while maintaining high grain yields meanwhile the influence of climate change and interannual variations of precipitation in time and space result in large fluctuations in annual crop water demand causing interannual changes in appropriate irrigation strategies in addition to water nitrogen is another important component affecting crop growth and yield wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015b from 1980 2012 the total consumption of n fertilizers in china increased by 158 from 9 3 24 0 million t yet total grain yield increased by only 70 yang et al 2017 the large use of n fertilizers substantially exceeded crop demand for n and did not significantly increase crop yields and n uptake leading to low n use efficiency cui et al 2010b li et al 2016 and potential environmental risks cui et al 2013b accumulation of no3 n in soil profile not absorbed by crops was serious and prevalent in wheat maize cropping system in china fang et al 2006 leading to very serious environmental risks such as n2o emissions from agricultural fields zhang et al 2013 soil degradation vashisht et al 2015 and groundwater contamination fang et al 2006 gu et al 2013 generally the need for food security and environmental protection is the paradox for n fertilizer use zhao et al 2006 showed a dramatically decreasing no3 n movement to deeper soil profile by optimizing n fertilization while keeping the higher grain yield thus a balancing between grain yield and the risk of n loss is a common aim for us liu et al 2018 however climate change and differences in soil types and other factors can lead to variations in management practices such as n application rates used and irrigation amounts applied in different regions ju et al 2004 wang et al 2017 concluded that appropriate n application rate for wheat production should be around 185 kg n ha 1 using data obtained from the literature and from field experiments and considering agricultural production and environmental impacts zhang et al 2015c recommended a reasonable n application rate for maize of 150 240 kg n ha 1 in the north china plain huang et al 2018 recommended seasonal n application rates of 190 and 150 kg n ha 1 for winter wheat and summer maize production respectively in china s huang huai hai plain in the guanzhong plain of china yang et al 2017 suggested proper n application rates for winter wheat and summer maize of 150 170 and 180 200 kg n ha 1 respectively in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system lü et al 2019 recommended 175 and 214 kg n ha 1 for wheat and maize which resulted in low environment stress and produced yields of 6799 and 7518 kg ha 1 respectively furthermore accumulation of no3 n in soil profile could be leached to deeper soil profile in conjunction with deep water percolation due to heavy precipitation in summer and unreasonable irrigation practices such as over flooding the implementation of appropriate n application rates coupled with reasonable irrigation schedules is essential for reducing deep percolation below the crop root zone and decreasing soil residual nitrate levels huang et al 2018 agricultural system models have been developed as tools to simulate crop responses to water and n treatments and to extend the results of field experiments to different soil types management practices and climate change ma et al 2001 for example the root zone water quality model 2 rzwqm2 version 2 10 2010 ahuja et al 2000 agricultural

hydrology chemistry nutrients pesticides crop growth and management practices in this study we used rzwqm2 to simulate crop development soil water content deep percolation and n concentration in the root zone and grain yield using rzwqm thorp et al 2007 concluded that reducing n application rate from 180 to 130 kg n ha 1 could reduce nitrate loss by 18 fang et al 2008 found that an n application rate of 200 kg n ha 1 for wheat maize in conjunction with irrigation at 50 of field capacity in the 0 50 cm soil layer was suitable in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system a long term simulation 1961 1999 with the rzwqm2 model by fang et al 2010 found that preseason irrigation of wheat should be delayed to the critical water requirement growth stage and that preseason irrigation for maize was needed in 40 of the years they also reported that an irrigation water ratio of 4 1 between wheat and maize could improve both water use efficiency wue and crop yield in the north china plain li and sun 2016 used the rzwqm2 model to optimize single irrigation treatments in order to obtain high maize yield and wue in northeast of china sun et al 2018 used the rzwqm2 model to explore water and n transport processes and nitrate leaching into groundwater over 10 years in a summer maize winter wheat rotation system in the north china plain jeong and bhattarai 2018 showed the need for accommodative n application rate as a result of the regional differences in agricultural systems and used rzwqm2 to determine best management practices for nitrogen applications focusing on rate time and placement however few studies have considered the effects of different precipitation years over the long term historical weather record on the productivity of the winter wheat summer maize rotation system widely used in china and the effects of deep percolation of irrigation water and n leaching on wheat and maize productivity in order to determine the optimal irrigation and n application rates also the differences in crop yields water and nitrogen use efficiency and water and n leaching due to various irrigation water amounts and n application rates have not been reported for different precipitation years the guanzhong plain in the shaanxi province of northwest china located in a semiarid to sub humid climate zone is a vital grain production area in the northwest region zhao et al 2018 it covers nearly 20 of the area of the province 34 000 km2 while provides more than 50 of the total food produced in the province yang et al 2017 the winter wheat summer maize rotation planting pattern is common in the region due to abundant solar radiation and optimal temperatures favorable for crop growth yang et al 2017 due to high potential evapotranspiration et precipitation is not sufficient to meet crop water requirements in this area and irrigation usually more than 75 mm becomes essential for agricultural production li et al 2013 xu et al 2019 in addition to this annual rainfall in the region mainly concentrated in august and september has over the past 50 years varied widely from 288 mm to 959 mm causing difficulties in precise agricultural irrigation management to obtain high yields in this region farmers usually use n fertilizers in amounts exceeding crop demand chang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015a high n inputs in conjunction with flood

summer maize cultivar wuke 2 grown from june to october and winter wheat cultivar xinong 979 grown from october to the following june winter wheat was planted in rows spaced 20 cm apart on 13 october

the common practice for this region of flood irrigation during the 2012 2013 wheat growing season we instituted different water treatments with 90 mm of irrigation applied at different growth stages different irrigation amounts 90 and 120 mm with different n application rates were applied during the 2013 2015 experimental period table 1 each treatment during 2012 2015 was replicated three times

measure soil water content and no3 n concentration were collected at different crop growth periods before and after each irrigation and after precipitation three random locations in each plot were sampled and then mixed well to form one sample for each plot the samples were taken from the soil surface to a depth of 100 cm at 10 cm intervals and from 100 to 200 cm at 20 cm intervals using an

ma et al 2003 recommended calibrating soil water first followed by soil n and crop growth the soil properties of each layer are listed in table 2 we measured the particle size distribution clay sand and silt percentages field capacity and permanent wilting point of soil the saturated hydraulic conductivity for each soil layer was estimated according to rawls et al 1982 then slightly adjusted manually to improve the simulation of soil water content then we calibrated the c n module of rzwqm2 according to ma et al 1998 and fang et al 2008 to establish the initial size of different c n pools in order to adjust the soil no3 n content after calibration of the soil parameters we calibrated the crop genetic coefficients for the ceres wheat and ceres maize crop models used within rzwqm2 using the measured grain yields biomass lai and n uptake the calibrated crop parameters are shown in table 3 to evaluate the accuracy of the simulation results for soil water content and soil no3 n content

cma cn first the drought index di was calculated using the following equation 5 d i p m σ where p is the annual precipitation m is the average annual precipitation over the period 1961 2017 and σ is the standard error di is used to distinguish wet di 0 35 normal 0 35 di 0 35 and dry di 0 35 precipitation years guo et al 2012 in this study di for maize was calculated using the precipitation values for the summer maize growing season june to september and for the winter wheat growing season october to the next may for the experimental location then 15 wet years with average precipitation ap of

were obtained the monthly precipitation in dry normal and wet years is shown in fig 1 the entire summer maize growing season was divided into seedling jointing jointing tasseling tasseling filling and filling ripening periods and the wheat growing season was divided into tillering jointing jointing boot boot filling and filling ripening periods based on the meteorological data of different precipitation years 16 scenarios of irrigation treatments were designed with 90 mm applied at various growth stages of each crop table 4 one treatment was a no irrigation rainfed treatment s1 four treatments consisted of one irrigation application s2 s5 six treatments consisted of two irrigation applications s6 s11 four treatments consisted of three irrigation applications s12 s15 the final treatment was four irrigation applications s16 the effects of these treatments varying in amount and timing of applied irrigation on grain yields deep percolation below the 120 cm soil depth wue iwue nue and n leaching were determined in order to identify reasonable irrigation strategies in different precipitation years the grain yield deep percolation and n leaching values were simulated using the rzwqm2 model the wue and iwue parameters were determined as follows the wue kg m 3 was calculated as grain yield y divided by evapotranspiration et during the growing season 6 w u e y 10 e t the

per unit of n fertilizer absorbed by crops nuptake 8 n u e y n u p t a k e finally we intentionally removed the irrigation treatments that had little effect on yields and wue but could cause greater deep percolation under the same irrigation amount we analyzed the response of crop yields n leaching deep percolation and wue to different n inputs from 0 to 240 kg n ha 1 for maize and from 0 to 300 kg n ha 1 for wheat under four water input levels with 0 mm 90 mm seedling stage 180 mm seedling jointing stage and 270 mm seedling jointing tasseling stage for maize and 90 mm jointing stage 180 mm jointing boot stage 270 mm jointing boot filling stage and 360 mm tillering jointing boot filling stage for wheat to evaluate the effect of the n application rate and interactive effects of water and n input on yield n leaching deep percolation and wue in order to identify the appropriate irrigation and n fertilization management in different precipitation years 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation 3 1 1 soil water content fig 2 shows the simulated and measured soil water contents in eight soil layers of the i1n2 treatment during the maize and wheat growing seasons in 2014 and 2015 the predictions of soil water content were good rmse 0 016 0 039 nrmse 5 7 14 2 for all soil depths except for the top depth 20 cm rmse 0 059 nrmse 21 6 in particular the simulated values agreed well with the measured values d 0 6 except for the 160 cm depth the simulated water contents at the top soil depth showed a poorer match with the measured data than those at deeper depths this result was consistent with the findings of yu et al 2006 hu et al 2006 and fang et al 2008 for the north china plain the main reason for this discrepancy was that water dynamics in the surface soil layer are more complex than in deeper soil layers because of high temporal variations in porosity conductivity and other properties hu et al 2006 which causes greater model uncertainty associated with soil parameter and processes in addition the discrepancy may also be due to error in the measured soil volumetric water content which was calculated from the measured gravimetric soil water content and the soil bulk density bulk density changes in response to the cultivation irrigation and precipitation conditions cai et al 2016 xu et al 2019 furthermore the soil water contents in the 0 80 cm layers changed more drastically in the summer maize than in the winter wheat growing period this was because more than 55 of the precipitation during the measurement period occurred during the maize growing period as shown in fig 3 a the simulated total profile 0 200 cm soil water storage for different n fertilization treatments was simulated with excellent accuracy rmse 4 51 5 25 cm nrmse 8 0 9 4 and the simulated results were in good agreement with the measured values d 0 65 0 71 the predicted and measured soil water contents obtained for the model validation data sets in the wheat maize rotation system from 2012 to 2014 are shown in fig 4 the rmse and nrmse values ranged from 2 84 to 5 52 cm and 5 3 10 2 respectively for different irrigation treatments during 2012 2013 and were comparable to the rmse and nrmse results obtained from the model calibration the values of d ranged from 0 71 to 0 96 with similar trends shown by the simulated and measured soil water values the accuracy of the simulation results for the 2013 2014 period was good nrmse 10 8 16 6 and most simulated values agreed well with the measured values d 0 55 0 75 except those corresponding to the

no3 n occurred in the 0 200 cm soil profile during the maize wheat rotation nitrate mainly accumulated in soil layers between 20 and 60 cm with a peak at 40 cm on 10 august in contrast after maize harvest on 12 october nitrate accumulated in soil layers between 60 and 120 cm with a peak at 80 cm during the subsequent wheat growing season some additional nitrate continued to move downward to depths below 120 cm in response to rain and several irrigation events and accumulated in the 130 160 cm layer by the wheat harvest date this no3 n fraction that accumulated below 120 cm would be difficult to be used by crops and poses a high risk of leaching into much deeper soil layers as shown in fig 3b the simulated total no3 n contents in the 0 200 cm soil profile for all n treatments were in reasonable agreement with the measured profile no3 n content the rmse values ranged from 70 0 92 1 kg ha 1 slightly larger than the value of 50 4 kg ha 1 in the 0 100 cm profile reported by fang et al 2008 for the north china plain however the accuracy of the simulated results was still good nrmse 11 9 19 0 the d values ranged from 0 70 to 0 82 denoting similar trends between the simulated and measured soil no3 n content significant variation in no3 n distribution in 0 200 cm soil profile was observed among the different n treatments and increased no3 n storage was observed with increasing n fertilization especially for the treatment with 360 kg n ha 1 applied per crop similar to the calibration results observed in 2014 2015 the validation results of the wheat maize rotation system subjected to different treatments during the 2013 2014 growing season were of good accuracy rmse 75 62 95 87 kg ha 1 and nrmse 12 9 18 9 and in good agreement with the measured values d 0 56 0 82 fig 6 the present results revealed an increase in both the simulated and measured soil no3 n content after crop harvest no3 n residue nr figs 3b and 6 in the 0 200 cm soil profile for n application rates above 120 kg n ha 1 for maize and 240 kg n ha 1 for wheat the nr of treatments with 120 kg n ha 1 for maize and 240 kg n ha 1 for wheat remained approximately unchanged denoting the correct n balance the nr was observed in soil after crop harvest especially for maize crops even when no n was applied this could be attributed to amounts of n left in deeper layers before maize was planted that could not be utilized by the crop in addition precipitation and mineralization of organic n could be crucial sources of soil n under these conditions dai et al 2015 reported the same observation in the loess plateau of china the soil nr values were above 400 kg n ha 1 before we planted maize in the experimental area due to higher n applied by the local farmers of the region 3 1 3 plant growth the simulated values of aboveground biomass were underestimated for both maize mre 5 4 and wheat mre 10 9 during the 2014 2015 crop seasons the relative errors ranged from 14 3 18 3 for maize and 16 4 to 0 1 for wheat table 5 simulated maize grain yield was overestimated by 6 5 whereas wheat grain yield was underestimated by 1 7 with relative errors ranging from 1 3 15 4 for maize and 11 1 10 4 for wheat the simulated aboveground n uptake deviated from the observed values by 5 8 for maize and 1 5 for wheat the corresponding relative errors for maize and wheat ranged from 1 3 11 0 and 11 6 7 1 respectively the biomass crop yield and aboveground n uptake values for maize and wheat were at their minimum when n application rate was 0 kg n ha 1 and they did not significantly increase p 0 05 with increasing n fertilizer inputs from 120 to 360 kg n ha 1 indicating the absence of significant effects on maize growth once the n application rate was above 120 kg n ha 1 similarly wheat grain yield did not significantly increase p 0 05 with increasing n fertilizer inputs from 120 to 360 kg n ha 1 for both high and low irrigation treatments indicating that over fertilization 120 kg n ha 1 did not significantly increase grain yields however we found no significant effect of the irrigation treatment on wheat biomass grain yield or aboveground n uptake although higher values were obtained for high irrigation treatments in particular the aboveground n uptake values of maize and wheat remained high when n application rate was 0 kg n ha 1 due to high levels of n mineralization fang et al 2006 and high soil nitrate accumulation fig 3b so that farmers do not need to apply n fertilizers before planting crops cui et al 2010a fig 7 shows the simulated and observed values of maize lai during the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons and of wheat lai during the 2012 2013 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 growing seasons the observed and simulated maize lai followed similar trends over time with rmse and d values ranging from 0 31 to 0 57 and from 0 71 to 0 91 respectively wheat lai during the 2012 2015 period was best predicted during the 2014 2015 season rmse 0

simulated by rzwqm2 model were acceptable but results under water and n stress were not good the underestimated lai values of the w9n240 and w9n120 treatments in 2013 2014 and of the w4 and w1 treatments in 2012 2013 were considered to be the main sources of error in the simulated values and this result was in agreement with previous studies dejonge et al 2011 fang et al 2009 song et al 2015 fig 8 shows the simulated and observed wheat and maize grain yields for different irrigation and n fertilization treatments in the wheat maize rotation system from 2012 to 2015 measured wheat yields for the different treatments in the 2012 2013 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 growing seasons ranged from 5274 to 7906 kg ha 1 simulation results were in good agreement with the measured data rmse 711 3 kg ha 1 nrmse 11 1 r 2 0 76 and d 0 87 similarly measured maize yields for the different treatments ranged from 5850 to 7120 kg ha 1 during the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 growing seasons with excellent

simulated and observed wue and nue values along with the simulated et deep percolation n leaching and plant n uptake results obtained for the wheat maize rotation system under different irrigation and n fertilization treatments during 2012 2015 the simulated wue of maize was in close agreement with the observed values and the accuracy of the simulated results was good nrmse 10 2 14 7 during the growing seasons of 2013 and 2014 however the accuracy of the corresponding model predictions obtained for wheat varied from excellent in 2014 2015 nrmse 7 7 to fair in 2013 2014 nrmse 25 1 and 2012 2013 nrmse 23 1 the wue values were underestimated for the w12n240 and w12n120 treatments in 2013 2014 and for the w6 treatment in 2012 2013 one possible reason was that simulated yields were a little higher than measured another possible reason was that there may have been some field sampling errors for these treatments these two reasons were considered the main sources of error in the model predictions the wue of both maize and wheat increased with increasing n application rate due to the increase in grain yield and water use ji et al 2014 similarly there was excellent agreement between the simulated and observed maize nue values during the 2014 nrmse 3 3 and 2015 5 7 growing seasons as for the wheat nue values the accuracy of the simulation results was excellent for 2014 2015 nrmse 5 3 and good for 2013 2014 nrmse 19 9 the nue for wheat appeared to decrease with increasing n application rate evapotranspiration increased with increasing irrigation amount for both maize and wheat table 6 for the same total water amount the irrigation treatment applied during the wheat regreening jointing period led to a significantly increased et w4 w3 w5 during the 2012 2013 wheat growing season the n application rate had no significant p 0 05 effect on the et of maize or wheat when it was above 120 kg ha 1 precipitation and irrigation significantly affected the amount of deep percolation below the root zone deep percolation increased with increasing irrigation amount for both maize and wheat during 2013 2014 deep percolation increased significantly as irrigation amount increased from 90 to 120 mm indicating that the irrigation amount had a significant effect on water movement in the soil profile irrigation at the winter tillering stage w3 and w5 significantly increased the deep percolation for the same irrigation amount w5 w4 and w3 during 2012 2013 table 6 mainly because wheat consumed less water during the seedling period and the soil water content remained higher for a long time after the irrigation causing larger amounts of deep percolation 58 mm for w5 and 60 mm for w3 deep percolation ranged from 81 mm to 139 mm for all treatments during the 2014 2015 wheat growing season which was greater than observed in other years when deep percolation ranged from 11 to 60 mm this was mainly due to high precipitation after irrigation was applied at the jointing stage causing large amounts of deep percolation similarly the n leaching amounts increased with increasing deep percolation and n application rate and showed marked interannual differences 3 3 irrigation and nitrogen management 3 3 1 response to irrigation management for different precipitation years maize yields did not show much difference in response to varied irrigation management in wet 6930 7683 kg ha 1 and normal years 7595 8809 kg ha 1 figs 9 a1 and b1 maize yields in wet and normal years decreased by an average 8 5 and 12 7 p 0 05 respectively under the rainfed condition s1 precipitation during the maize season was mainly concentrated in july august and september in the wet years 496 mm and normal years 333 mm fig 1 thus irrigation at the seedling stage was the key to achieving high maize yields and the greatest values of iwue in wet and normal years figs 9a4 and b4 were seen with irrigation at the seedling stage in dry years maize yields decreased on average by 38 7 under the rainfed condition and showed more drastic fluctuations to different irrigation treatments fig 9c1 a single irrigation could not produce a high maize yield although it could result in a large iwue if the irrigation occurred at the seedling or jointing stage figs 9c4 if two irrigations could be applied to maize they should be applied at the seedling and jointing stages to ensure higher yields in dry years irrigating at the maize grain filling stage led to the lowest iwue and did not significantly p 0 05 increase production compared with rainfed yields for all the precipitation years this was partially because more rainfall occurred in the maize grain filling stage and that rainfall was enough to meet the crop water demand another reason could be that maize yields were significantly decreased when maize was subjected to water stress at early growth stages when higher temperature and drought conditions are frequent in dry years song et al 2016 deep percolation during maize growth significantly p 0 05 increased with increasing irrigation water due to the fact that total water input was much greater than crop water requirement under high levels of irrigation figs 9a2 b2 and c2 greater values of deep percolation were achieved by irrigating during the maize seedling stage in normal and dry years s2 s3 s4 s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10 s11 s12 s13 s14 s15 mainly because less than 90 mm water was used by maize and the remaining soil water percolated out of the root zone deep percolation is a vital component of the water balance in hydrologic processes xu et al 2017 and can also contribute to n loss through leaching and runoff bouman et al 2007 sato et al 2009 in our study n leaching amount was strongly correlated with deep percolation demonstrating that changes in n leaching were consistent with changes in deep percolation wue and nue responses to irrigation were similar to yield responses to irrigation i e not significant in wet and normal years due to relatively abundant precipitation and ranged from 2 32 2 48 kg m 3 for wue and 45 9 47 9 for nue in wet years figs 9a3 and a6 and 2 43 2 65 kg m 3 for wue and 47 6 50 4 for nue in normal years figs 9b3 and b6 in dry years wue values exhibited a much different response to varied irrigation management fig 9c3 showing the same change trend as observed for maize yield results showed that irrigating in the maize seedling and jointing stages could significantly increase grain yield and wue in dry years of the guanzhong plain similar results were obtained by chen et al 2011 in our study total amount of irrigation had no significant p 0 05 effect on nue but irrigation time had a great influence on nue irrigating at the maize jointing and boot stages could significantly p 0 05 increase nue fig 9c6 because adequate water at the jointing and boot stages could increase n accumulation and n distribution ratio in stem and leaves thus benefitting n assimilation and absorption by maize in later stages miao et al 2011 simulated wheat yields showed greater responses to different irrigation treatments than maize yields for all precipitation years figs 10 a1 b1 and c1 it was more difficult to meet the wheat water requirement due to the lower rainfall during the wheat growing seasons average 303 mm for wet years 232 mm for normal years and 168 mm for dry years rainfed wheat yields averaged 5110 3963 and 2776 kg ha 1 in wet normal and dry years respectively and were reduced by 37 9 57 10 and 72 5 compared with yields under adequate irrigation conditions irrigation at the jointing stage for all precipitation years could increase wheat yields significantly p 0 05 and produced the highest iwue 2 87 kg m 3 for wet 3 07 kg m 3 for normal 2 82 kg m 3 for dry years figs 10a4 b4 and c4 indicating that the jointing stage was the critical wheat growth stage for irrigation in the guanzhong plain results were similar to those presented by zheng et al 2016 who concluded that the wheat jointing phase was the most sensitive phase to water deficit followed by the anthesis phase and zhou et al 2018 who found irrigation applied at the wheat jointing stage could significant increase wheat yield to avoid significantly lower wheat yields two irrigations during the jointing boot and boot filling stages were necessary to meet the water demand of wheat in wet years during normal precipitation years three irrigations during the jointing boot boot filling and filling ripening stages are recommended while in dry years four irrigations are recommended deep percolation during wheat growth exhibited consistent trends in all precipitation years figs 10a2 b2 and c2 greater values of deep percolation were produced by irrigating during the wheat tillering jointing period s2 s3 s4 s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10 s11 s12 s13 s14 s15 this greater deep percolation was probably because the combination of excess water stored in the soil and irrigation water was far beyond the wheat water requirement during that period of time resulting in a higher potential risk of percolation out of the root zone similarly to what was observed during the maize growing season the trend of n leaching amounts was consistently and strongly related to deep percolation amounts during the wheat growing season there was no significant difference p 0 05 in the amount of n leaching in different precipitation years in particular greater values of n leaching with irrigation during the wheat tillering jointing period were caused by simultaneous influence of greater amounts of deep percolation and greater fertilization applied during the period wue values for wheat showed differing responses to varied irrigation management in wet years 1 56 2 00 kg ha 1 m 3 normal years 1 36 2 10 kg ha 1 m 3 and dry years 1 11 2 08 kg ha 1 m 3 and the change trend was consistent with the change trend observed for wheat yield figs 10a3 b3 and c3 irrigating during the jointing boot and boot filling growth stages improved wheat wue in our study mostly because irrigation at the jointing and boot stages corresponded to pre and post anthesis water consumption optimized the canopy structure and ensured wheat physiological water demand post anthesis all of which was beneficial for improving grain yield and wue xu et al 2018 similarly to results observed for maize nue values were little influenced by total irrigation amount but irrigation date had a much greater influence on nue figs 10a6 b6 and c6 it appeared that irrigating during the boot filling and filling ripening stages could increase nue significantly p 0 05 while irrigating during the jointing boot stage could decrease nue adequate water supply in the jointing stage could promote wheat vegetative growth and negative affect the nitrogen absorption by grain while irrigation in the reproductive growth stage of winter wheat could improve the nitrogen absorption by grains meng et al 2016 3 3 2 interactive effects of irrigation and nitrogen management average simulated summer maize yields figs 11 a1 d1 in all three precipitation year categories were affected by the n application rate yields initially increased sharply with increasing n application rate and then increased more slowly once n application rate reached a certain value this type of response is well described by a linear plus plateau model liu et al 2016 yang et al 2017 in wet and normal years as previously discussed due to abundant precipitation n application rate became the main factor affecting maize yields increasing irrigation and nitrogen application amounts did not significantly p 0 05 increase maize yields when irrigation amount was greater than 90 mm and the interaction effect of irrigation and nitrogen on yield was not significant under the non irrigated condition in dry years average maize yield increased significantly p 0 05 to 3555 kg ha 1 as n application rate increased from 0 to 60 kg n ha 1 but there was no significant difference p 0 05 in yield for n application rates greater than 60 kg n ha 1 when irrigation amounts of 90 180 and 270 mm were applied average maize yield increased significantly p 0 05 to 5796 7393 and 7499 kg ha 1 as n application rate increased from 0 to 120 kg n ha 1 0 140 kg n ha 1 and 0 140 kg n ha 1 respectively and no significant increases in yield were seen as n application rate increase above those values similar results were simulated for wheat figs 12 a1 d1 and the highest grain yields were obtained with high irrigation amounts and high n application rates in dry years the critical n application rates were 200 220 240 and 260 kg n ha 1 with 90 180 270 and 360 mm irrigation applied respectively wheat yields increased significantly p 0 05 to 4716 6610 7772 and 9106 kg ha 1 as n application rate increased to the critical values similar results were found in wet and normal years results indicated that water input promoted the absorption and utilization of nitrogen by crops therefore n fertilizer application rate should be adjusted according to water conditions experienced by the crop wue values for maize and wheat were mainly affected by yields and total evapotranspiration xu et al 2018 maize wue figs 11a4 d4 and wheat wue figs 12a4 d4 increased with increasing n application rate which showed that changes in wue were consistent with changes in crop yields results indicated that n fertilizer input could increase both crop growth and evapotranspiration but had a greater influence on increasing crop yields thus increasing wue for a given n fertilizer application rate wheat wue showed an increasing trend p 0 05 as irrigation amount increases in dry years for example with 240 kg n ha 1 applied wue increased from 1 53 kg m 3 to 1 75 1 83 and 1 90 kg m 3 as irrigation increased from 90 to 360 mm in contrast wue showed a slightly decreasing trend with the increasing irrigation amount for maize in wet and normal years and for wheat in wet years for example with 140 kg n ha 1 applied to maize in normal years wue decreased from 2 42 kg m 3 to 2 40 2 35 and 2 32 kg m 3 as irrigation increased from 90 to 270 mm considering that increased n application rate increases wue farmers should avoid unreasonable applications of irrigation that would reduce wue the n application rate is the main factor affecting n leaching with n leaching values increasing with increasing n fertilizer application rate zhang et al 2015c wang et al 2017 in our study simulated n leaching clearly increased with increasing n application rate for both maize figs 11 a2 d2 and wheat figs 12a2 d2 in contrast to the yield response observed for increasing n application we found that n leaching for both maize and wheat increased slowly initially as n application rate increased and then increased more sharply with further increases in n application rate for example with 90 mm of irrigation applied to summer maize in wet years fig 11b2 average n leaching increased from 3 4 6 9 kg ha 1 as n application rate increased from 0 to 120 kg ha 1 then as n application rate increased from 120 to 240 kg n ha 1 n leaching increased sharply from 6 9 30 5 kg ha 1 the main reason for this result was that nitrogen absorption by crops reaches a maximum value at the point where n amount exceeds a critical value causing more and more nitrogen to be stored in the soil resulting in much greater n leaching similarly n leaching increased as water input increased and deep percolation increased for maize figs 11a3 d3 and wheat figs 12a3 d3 previous studies reported that increasing irrigation significantly increased deep percolation and nitrate leaching li et al 2015 in our study deep percolation increased with increasing irrigation amounts for both maize and wheat deep percolation in wheat increased from 14 to 80 mm as irrigation increased from 90 to 360 mm with the 240 kg n ha 1 application rate in dry years furthermore deep percolation in wheat decreased with increasing n application rate for example deep percolation decreased from 75 to 23 mm for wheat in dry years when n application rate increased from 0 to 300 kg n ha 1 with the 180 mm irrigation amount fig 12b3 this finding was probably due to the higher n application rate promoting crop growth thus increasing crop water consumption and thus reducing the amount of deep percolation identifying reasonable irrigation and fertilization is of great importance for obtaining higher grain yields with lower environmental risks yang et al 2017 excessive n fertilization does not result in significant increases in yield but leads to wasted resources and increased environmental risks chen et al 2014 cui et al 2013b jeong and bhattarai 2018 one of the most important risk factors is leached no3 n which could contaminate groundwater and cause water eutrophication gu et al 2013 le et al 2010 understanding the balance between the effects of n fertilization and irrigation on deep percolation n leaching wue and grain yields under different precipitation regimes is thus a crucial task the present simulation results suggest that 140 kg n ha 1 fertilizer application rate coupled with 90 mm irrigation amount in wet and normal years and 140 kg n ha 1 fertilizer rate coupled with 180 mm irrigation amount in dry years were optimal strategies for maize and 240 kg n ha 1 fertilizer application rate coupled with 180 270 and 360 mm irrigation amount in wet normal and dry years respectively were appropriate irrigation and nitrogen management for wheat 4 conclusions an appropriate n application rate coupled with suitable irrigation schedules should be implemented to obtain high grain yields while reducing deep percolation and n leaching in the intensively cropped farming practice of the maize wheat rotation system in china the present simulation results obtained with a calibrated rzwqm2 model for different precipitation years from 1961 to 2017 showed that higher irrigation and n application rates could produce higher yields however these management practices could also result in lower wue iwue and nue values along with significant deep percolation of water and n leaching identifying reasonable irrigation schedules and n application rates could increase wue iwue and nue values along with considerably reducing deep percolation and n leaching while maintaining high grain yields the optimal irrigation recommendations determined in this study could be adjusted according to variations in precipitation years and climate change especially for wheat growth irrigation and rainfall promote the absorption and utilization of nitrogen by crops and n fertilizer application rate should be adjusted according to variations in water availability to crops considering grain yields and environmental effects reasonable n application rates for summer maize and winter wheat in the guanzhong plain of china were estimated to be 140 and 240 kg n ha 1 respectively when coupled with recommended irrigation management in different precipitation years these rates resulted in a considerable reduction in n loss with only slightly lower grain production

food for the world population there is a need to understand how the concentration of potentially toxic as well as essential elements can be influenced by the irrigation approach employed for instance which is key for rice production the use of flooded irrigation allows the lowland rice to suffer less from plagues compared to upland rice and these factors also contribute to the high productivity fageria 2011 in soil the flooding promotes a series of reactions including physical chemical and biological processes carrijo et al 2018 these reactions are the result of the soil reduction process

farming practice and the polishing washing remove not only toxic elements but also important essential elements such mn fe and zn pedron et al 2019 therefore several authors study the effects of different irrigation systems on rice crop rice grown under flooded soils condition where excess water leads to increased mobilization of chemical elements has potentially increased accumulation of mineral elements ma et al 2008 xu et al 2008 the water management has been used to decrease the uptake of toxic elements by rice such as as rahaman and sinha 2013 observed a decrease of approximately 24 in the concentration of as in grains under irrigation by intermittent flooding despite the decreasing in as levels the authors also identified lower levels of fe and zn sarkar et al 2012 cultivated rice in areas with as contaminated water and soil the intermittent flooding irrigation provided the lowest levels of as in grains however the intermittent flooding irrigation causes soil oxidation

mclaughlin 1999 from the agronomic point of view water management methods in rice alternatives to continuous flooding are beneficial as they usually decrease water demand for rice production while

varieties the rice varieties brs sinuelo cl puitá inta cl and brs pampa were developed for flooded paddies brs sinuelo cl and puitá inta cl have a biological cycle from seedling emergence to harvest of around 121 135 days medium cycle and brs pampa approximately 106 120 days early cycle the variety brs sinuelo cl is a modern cultivar originated from the backcrossing between the commercial variety brs 7 taim and as 3510 herbicide tolerant for imidazolidone the puitá inta cl is a variety derived from irga 417 by mutagenesis brs pampa is a modern variety derived from irga 417 and brs jaburu embrapa 2018 2 2 experimental field the experiments were carried out at the terras baixas experimental station of the embrapa clima temperado located in the municipality of capão do leão state of rio grande do sul brazil the soil of the experimental area is classified as typic albaqualf soil haplic planosol soil survey staff 2010 embrapa 2011 the climate is a subtropical humid with hot summers according to köppen classification peel et al 2007 the annual mean of temperature and precipitation are 17 8 c and 1366 9 mm respectively embrapa 2016 2 3 rice water management the plants were cultivated under different water managements considering the phenological phases of the crop cycle vegetative vp reproductive r1 and ripening r2 the experiment was conducted in randomized blocks with split plot and four replicates per treatment phenological phases were associated to the main plot 20 m x 4 6 m soil water tension was applied to the subplots 4 6 m x 3 5 m water treatments were i continuous flooded irrigation during all phenological phases keeping a flooding depth of about 7 5 cm depth ii saturated soil soil water tension of 0 kpa iii water deficit range 0 10 kpa and iv water deficit range 0 40 kpa water management was independent for every experimental plot as example supposing the subplot ii of block 3 reached the threshold level for irrigation 10 kpa for that treatment it was irrigated back to saturation independently of the tension readings on the other replications of the same treatment furthermore there were rains in these time intervals thus making particular the mean water tension of each plot the concentration of elements in rice grains was established based on the real mean tension of each plot independently originating the regression and the respective confidence interval for the mineral content as the water tension was increased thus the water tension levels reported in the figures of the present study are based on the real mean tension of each plot of the same phenological phase 16 plots and not on the theoretical pre established water tensions 10 20 40 kpa the water management for treatments ii iii and iv were imposed to the following phenological phases vegetative period vp from v5 to r0 reproductive r1 from r1 to r4 10 days and reproductive maturation r2 from r4 10 days to r7 the phenological phases v5 5 leaves r0 panicle initiation r1 panicle differentiation r4 anthesis and r7 maturation correspond to the phenological phases stated by the scale of counce et al 2000 for the rice crop the rice varieties brs sinuelo cl puitá inta cl and brs pampa were cultivated in 2014 2015 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 seasons respectively the soil was tilled by plowing and harrowing and the sowing dates were nov 11 2014 nov 16 2015 and nov 09 2016 respectively rice was drill seeded at density of 100 kg ha 1 with rows spaced in 17 5 cm the fertilization was based on soil analysis considering the expectation for high response of the crop to fertilization for this purpose 300 kg ha 1 of n p k was applied in the sowing furrow following the formulas 5 20 30 5 20 20 and 5 25 25 for brs sinuelo cl puitá inta cl and brs pampa respectively sosbai 2016 nitrogen topdressing was divided into two applications the first in dry soil preceding the water entry in the four leaf stage v4 and the second was spread on the still water layer water was not removed prior to n topdressing at panicle initiation r0 urea 45 n was used as the source of nitrogen the other crop treatments followed the technical guide for irrigated rice sosbai 2016 flooding started at v4 4 leaf stage of rice after the first n topdressing for the implementation of the water treatments a drainage was performed at the beginning of each period of imposition of the soil water tension the subplot was irrigated again when it reached the threshold water tension by establishing a 10 cm water layer for 24 h two sensors watermark electro tensiometers irrometer co connected to a datalogger were installed per subplot at a depth of 10 cm to monitor the soil water tension during the periods when the plots as well as rice plants were not subjected to drying treatments subplots were kept flooded at approximately 7 5 cm depth however there were two more periods in which the crop remained with water layer v4 to v5 and r0 to r1 which corresponds to the period between topdressing with n 4 days after each application thus avoiding possible influence of interaction between soil water tension and n uptake by plants table 1 shows the number of times that each treatment was irrigated within the period the phenological phase r2 presented lower irrigation number since it was shorter for all cultivars the classification of counce et al 2000 was adopted to monitor the phenological phases of rice the panicle initiation r0 was considered to occur four days before panicle differentiation carli et al 2014 the grains were harvested manually threshed and pre cleaned then the samples were subjected to drying at a controlled temperature of 30 c to 13 humidity 2 4 determination of trace elements in grains the grains were husked milled ika a

nitric acid synth brazil afterwards samples were treated according to paniz et al 2018 they were left to stand during 24 h at 25 c then heated to 95 c during 4 h easydigest analab france and finally diluted to 40 ml with type 1 water master system all gehaka brazil blank solutions and the certified reference material srm 1568b rice flour national institute of standards and technology usa were concomitantly analyzed the analyses were carried by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms 7900 agilent japan 2 5 soil characterization the soils were evaluated regarding the level of trace elements as cd co cu fe mn ni pb and se an extraction procedure was applied for this purpose approximately 200 mg of soil 0 25 mm was weighed in ptfe vessels and 5 ml of subboiled nitric acid 14

institute for reference materials and measurements ermcc141 loam soil was used to test the method accuracy the agricultural characteristics such as ph organic matter nutrients ca mg k and p cation exchange capacity cec and texture sand clay and silt were conducted following the method by embrapa 2011 and obade and la 2016 being the results presented in table 2 potassium p ca and mg were determined by using an ion exchange resin in aqueous solution for extraction the determination of ca2 mg2 were performed by complexometric method using edta k by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer contra300 analytik jena germany and p by spectrophotometer model uv m51 bel photonics 2 6 statistics previously a spearman correlation was performed using all available data the correlation coefficient r ranges from 1 to 1 the strongest values are close to 1 both variables increase or 1 when one variable increases the other decreases zar 2005 also the data set was explored by regression analysis this statistical test consist in the regression adjustment between soil water tensions mean of the tension observed during the treatment period and the mineral content in the grain by using the statistical environment r rct 2016 the variables were submitted to a preliminary analysis of variance by the f test at 5 probability to verify treatment effects when any significance was found data was submitted to regression analysis only 1st degree regressions were adopted which were identified according to their levels of significance being later directly compared by their respective 95 confidence intervals according to concenço et al 2018 regressions were considered distinct in sections where their respective confidence intervals did not overlap all graphs were drawn in the r environment by using functions made available by the packages expdes and ggplot2 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil characterization and effects promoted by irrigation the facultative and anaerobic microorganisms use inorganic soil compounds as electron acceptors in their respiration thus reducing the oxidized soil components in a sequence predicted by thermodynamics buresh et al 2008 such as nitrate no3 manganese mn iv iron fe iii sulfate so4 2 these inorganic compounds are respectively reduced to n2 mn ii fe ii and s ii ponnamperuma 1972 regarding no3 reactions firstly nh4 released from mineralized organic matter or fertilizer can be diffused in the aerobic thin layer and oxidized to no3 secondly no3 diffused in the anaerobic zone the largest proportion of the submerged soil is reduced to n2 buresh et al 2008 other products of the organic matter dissimilation such as co2 are reduced to ch4 producing h bartlett and james 1993 therefore the ph redox potential eh and electrical conductivity ec are consequently altered table 3 presents the characteristics of the soils used for this study the soils presented ph 4 3 soils used for brs pampa cultivation presented the lowest ph and the highest concentration of organic matter table 2 the ph can slightly increase or decrease during rice cultivation due to the influence of co2 normally the majority of the flooded soils presents ph of approximately 7 ponnamperuma 1972 after flooding the soil redox potential eh decreases caused by biological reduction processes and the electrical conductivity ec increases reaching a maximum and decreasing to stable values the ec increasing is due to the mobilization of mn2 and fe2 and accumulation of nh4 hco3 and rcoo in addition cations adsorbed on the colloids are dislocated by fe2 mn2 and nh4 de data 1981 in the present study the soils were classified as loam soils and their characteristics were very similar among the three years of study according to the data shown in table 2 regarding the trace elements amounts the soil used for brs pampa presented the lowest levels of ca k mg fe co ni as and zn and the highest for cu table 3 all these results help understanding the minerals accumulation in the grains 3 2 concentration of chemical elements in rice grains pearson s analysis table 4 reported the following significant positive correlations co x mn

all of them were negatively correlated with as according to kabata pendias 2004 aerated higher o2 and acidic soils ph 3 present increased availability of cd zn mn and pb soil microorganisms also influence the availability and forms of elements such as and pb kabata pendias 2004 arsenic and cd present opposed behavior regarding water management with higher levels of water decreasing the cd availability and consequently its levels in grains hu et al 2013 however although the interaction between soil conditions and the impact on the mineral content in rice grains are known there is lack of information about the phenological phases of the rice development which according to our hypothesis corresponds to the higher influence on the minerals accumulation by the grains 3 3 influence of phenological phases in the absorption of potentially toxic and essential elements figs 1 3 show the regressions between the concentration of trace elements in the grains and the average soil water tensions during the considered period applied in each phenological phase regarding the potentially toxic elements fig 1 shows that the concentration of as decreased as function of the increase of water tension decreased irrigation for the three evaluated rice varieties as expected many authors observed the same effect rahaman and sinha 2013 observed a reduction of approximately 24 in the as concentration in grains under intermittent flooding they irrigated the plants during the 15th 40th days after transplantation then they waited the level of water to decrease and after 2 4 days they applied irrigation again they also evaluated other methods anaerobic cultivation and water saturated soil decreased about 22 and 21 of total as in grains respectively all these methods were compared to the common system of cultivation flooding despite the reduction of as concentrations in grains the authors also identified decreased concentration of fe and zn sarkar et al 2012 studied the intermittent flooding of rice in areas with water and soil contaminated with as bengal river india this irrigation approach was promising since the lower levels of as were accompanied by higher productivity which could be related to the reduced as toxicity to the rice plant in the present study according to fig 1 we identified that r1 is the main phenological phase responsible for the mitigation of as in the grains of the three evaluated cultivars when using the intermittent flooding as the water management approach whilst during the vp a non significant impact on as mitigation for any of the cultivars occurred for brs sinuelo cl the r2 phenological phase was not significant regarding as mitigation while for puitá inta cl beyond r1 phase the r2 phase was also significant for as mitigation lower than r1 and for brs pampa both r1 and r2 phases presented similar significance besides the rice variety the reduction ability of the soil can also influence as geodynamics by changes in the species formed or through changes related to ph organic matter mineralization and chemical reduction of iron magnesium and sulfur frohne et al 2011 rice with late stage vegetative development accumulates higher levels of inorganic arsenic i as as iii as v in grains than other plant species arsenate as v is strongly adsorbed on fe oxides of soils however in flooded soils the as v is reduced to as iii which is more weakly adsorbed by soils and consequently is readily up taken by the silicate transporters ma et al 2008 then accumulating in grains also the redox potential and sorbent content of soil amorphous fe and mn oxides are the main factors that limit the as uptake frohne et al 2011 in contrast to what happened to as mitigation increasing soil water tension significantly increased cd accumulation in all phenological phases of the three studied rice varieties as reported in fig 1 this is not a total surprise considering cd translocation ability through plants to grains arao et al 2009 ito and iimura 1976 cadmium is a potentially toxic element of significant concern since it has a cumulative effect on the human organism the consumption of rice containing high concentrations of cd leads to the disease known as itai itai and problems linked to the kidneys kobayashi 1978 singh and mclaughlin 1999 the cd availability is reduced in flooded soils once cd combines with s resulting in cds with low solubility when the soil is drained the oxidation increases converting cds into cdso4 which is more soluble and readily absorbed by the plant ito and iimura 1976 nevertheless despite the significant increase in cd concentration in the grains of the three varieties brs sinuelo cl presented cd concentrations below the maximum level ml allowed for cd in rice established by either european commission ec 2006 regulation i e 200 μg kg 1 and the three varieties presented cd concentrations below the ml for cd set by codex alimentarius of 400 μg kg 1 fao who 2017 in other words by evaluating the as mitigation pattern in the grains with increase of soil water tension we can conclude that increased cd accumulation is occurring concomitantly being the magnitude of the statistically significant phenological phases for as and cd concentrations inversely proportional namely r1 for brs sinuelo cl lowest for as and highest for cd and r1 and r2 for puitá inta cl and brs pampa moreover it is worth mentioning that although puitá inta cl was the most effective rice variety to mitigate as under higher soil water tension its cd accumulation sky rocked which exceeded by around 50 the ml set by ec 200 μg kg 1 to sum up the continuously decrease of water in soil revealed that all phenological phases vp r1 and r2 are important for cd accumulation in rice fig 1 the main phase was the r1 followed by r2 and vp for both brs sinuelo cl and puitá inta cl for brs pampa the vp was most pronounced than the r2 inahara et al 2007 observed that using the flooding system between 15 days before panicle emergence onset of flag leaf and 25 days later cd concentration in the brown rice decreased by 84 however the authors did not evaluate the presence of as on the other hand arao et al 2009 investigated the simultaneous effect on cd and as before and after the onset of the flag leaf they observed that the best irrigation management was flooding after the panicle emerged the cd concentrations in grains were lower and the total as did not change however the concentration of inorganic as increased hu et al 2013 recommended the use of the traditional cultivation system flooding type irrigation until the tillering phase appearance of lateral stems to guarantee both productivity and low concentrations of cd and as in grains lead accumulation in grains followed similar behavior of cd meaning the r1 was the most important phase for pb accumulation under increasing soil water tension fig 1 except for brs sinuelo cl which did not show any statistically significant correlation of pb accumulation or mitigation with soil water tension swt regardless the phenological phase or swt the r2 phase showed a non significant decrease in the pb levels associated with the increase in the soil water tension except for brs pampa for this rice cultivar the higher the soil water tension during the r2 phase the most effective the pb mitigation was williams et al 2009 found a positive correlation between pb and cd in rice shoot husk bran and endosperm they highlighted the accumulation in grains and the transference to the food chain moreover still in fig 1 lead accumulation also was statistically significant for puitá inta cl in vp for increased swt finally it is worth mentioning that regardless the rice cultivar nor the soil water tension pb levels in the evaluated rice grains were always lower than 40 μg kg 1 which is well below the maximum levels set for cereals of 200 μg kg 1 by both european commission and codex alimentarius commission ec 2006 fao who 2005 regarding the essential elements shown in fig 2 the higher the soil water tension the higher the cu levels in the grains of all cultivars during r1 as well as vp except for puitá inta cl which had a non significant correlation to soil water tension puitá inta cl and brs pampa presented higher levels of cu than brs sinuelo cl the cu availability is dependent on the soil ph soils with low ph values increase the cu availability li et al 2008 the presence of hco3 may be the source for the cuco3 precipitation zong and xu 2004 iron and zn concentrations in rice grains presented a weak correlation with the soil water tension fig 2 only a weak significant positive correlation between zn and soil water tension was observed in the r1 phase for brs sinuelo cl and brs pampa according to the literature the flooding reduced environment generally may increase fe and mn by reductive dissolution of fe and mn oxides other elements as cu and zn may be precipitated as sulfides under strongly reducing conditions afterwards they can be chelated by the humic acid forming partial soluble complexes ghosh and bhattacharyya 2004 other important mechanism which decreases the presence of these elements in the grains zn cu fe and others is the sequestration and storage in roots these minerals are frequently found in the vacuoles and cell walls in soluble forms from where only a small portion translocates to grains kabata pendias 2004 brun et al 2001 fig 3 shows the concentrations of mn co mg se and ni as function of the soil water tension the soil water tension increase in vp phase presented a weak negative association with the concentration of mn in grains of brs pampa the r1 was the most prominent phase for mn accumulation at higher soil water tensions for puitá inta cl and brs pampa brs sinuelo cl presented the weakest positive correlations with the increase of soil water tension in both phases r1 and r2 magnesium se and ni were determined for the varieties brs sinuelo cl puitá inta cl and brs sinuelo cl respectively fig 3 for ni the r1 was significant with positive correlation between soil water tension and concentration in grains the phases vp and r1 were significant to increase the content of se in both rice varieties at higher soil water tensions for mg no significant correlation was observed for brs sinuelo cl in general the higher availability of minerals occurs under flooding condition this fact is explained by increased diffusion and displacement of exchange sites to the soil solution such nh4 fe2 and mn2 fageria et al 2011 sahrawat 2012 magnesium and ca present increased solubility due to the displacement to the soil solution by mn and fe copper and zn also present increased solubility in flooded soils however this higher availability is compromised by the level of soluble sulfides which form precipitates sahrawat 2012 in the present study the grains accumulated the majority of chemical elements under increased soil water tension non flooded especially during r1 although the flooding present high availability of soil minerals the accumulation into grains seems to be influenced by other several variables associated to soil constitution and plant physiology cobalt is an element which present low levels in rice and rice derivatives batista et al 2010 pedron et al 2016 here the rice variety and the phenological phase were important variables for co accumulation in grains fig 3 for brs sinuelo cl no significant correlations were found regardless the soil water tension for puitá inta cl the r1 phase was determinant to increase the level of co in grains at higher soil water tensions finally brs pampa presented a significant negative correlation in the vp phase for co according to fao who it is necessary the development of new strategies to mitigate the transfer of as present in soil to rice grains irrigation management is directly related to the concentration of as in rice grains however as far as we know this is the first study which associated the impact of phenological phases soil water tension and rice varieties on the concentrations of essential and potentially toxic elements in rice grains the alteration of soil water tension was capable of changing the uptake of most of the evaluated elements in the different phenological phases in general aerobic soil higher soil water tensions promoted accumulation of cd all rice varieties tested and cu brs sinuelo cl in the vegetative phase vp however this same phenological phase at higher soil water tensions decreased the accumulation of mn and co for the cultivar brs pampa in r1 at higher water tensions the grains presented the lowest concentrations of as and the highest concentrations for cd co cu mn ni pb se and zn finally r2 at higher soil water tension increased the uptake and accumulation in the grains for brs sinuelo cl while reduced the levels of pb in brs pampa 4 summary and conclusions soil water tension variation during the reproductive period exerted the most significant influence on the trace element concentrations in rice grains irrigation management in rice is particularly related to the concentration of as cd and pb in rice grains soil aeration reduces arsenic as content while keeping cadmium cd and lead pb in acceptable levels according to fao who the higher soil water tension in vegetative phase increased cd for all varieties and cu for brs sinuelo cl contents while reducing mn and co uptake for brs pampa on the other hand the initial reproductive phase panicle initiation anthesis is the main phase regarding the uptake of chemical elements higher soil water tension in this phenological phase implied the lowest arsenic as accumulation in grains concomitantly with higher accumulation of the toxic elements cd and pb although they were kept in acceptable levels according to fao who some essential elements namely mn puita and pampa zn sinuelo and pampa se cu co puita and ni sinuelo were also favored by aerobic soils the increased soil water tension in the reproductive 2 phase anthesis ripening was important for the accumulation of cd in the three varieties and to decrease the levels of pb in brs pampa funding agencies the authors are grateful to fundação de amparo à pesquisa do estado de são paulo fapesp grants 2014 05151 0 and2016

10807,the adoption of water saving practices in rice cultivation modifies soil water tension regime then influencing accumulation of chemical elements in rice grains some studies report higher concentrations of arsenic as in rice grains produced in anaerobic soils compared to those produced in aerobic soils however there is a lack of information about the association between water stress

higher soil water tension in vegetative phase influenced cd accumulation mn cu and co the reproductive phase 1 panicle initiation anthesis is the main phase regarding uptake of chemical elements when

cadmium intermittent flooding 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l is a staple food for more than 50 of the global population muthayya et al 2014 being one of the biggest crops cultivated after corn and wheat fao who 2012 rice grains are composed mainly of starch in their internal part containing important micronutrients such as fe mn zn cu fibers and vitamins grp 2017 studies on genetic or agricultural biofortification improve the content of essential elements and vitamins in grains however the concentration of potentially toxic elements such as as and cd can be also increased grp 2017 arao et al 2009 ashraf et al 2018 essential elements such as co cu fe mn se and zn are necessary to human diet since they participate in the composition of various enzymes and cells table s1 in contrast potentially toxic elements such as as cd and pb can damage human body especially considering the long term exposure klaassen and watkins 1996 walter et al 2008 because rice is an important food for the world population there is a need to understand how the concentration of potentially toxic as well as essential elements can be influenced by the irrigation approach employed for instance which is key for rice production the use of flooded irrigation allows the lowland rice to suffer less from plagues compared to upland rice and these factors also contribute to the high productivity fageria 2011 in soil the flooding promotes a series of reactions including physical chemical and biological processes carrijo et al 2018 these reactions are the result of the soil reduction process pezeshki and delaune 2012 due to the anoxic soil environment after the suppression of atmospheric o2 the anaerobic or near anaerobic metabolism predominates patrick and mahapatra 1968 multiplying the obligatory and facultative anaerobic microorganisms neue 1997 influencing the accumulation of essential and potentially toxic elements in rice grains there are many ways to decrease the levels of potentially toxic elements especially as in rice such as the cooking washing bae et al 2002 sengupta et al 2006 raab et al 2009 polishing sun et al 2008 meharg et al 2008 lombi et al 2009 bioremediation using microorganisms li et al 2011a and 2011b zhao et al 2009 liu et al 2005 ahmed et al 2006 chen et al 2007 gonzalezchavez et al 2002 ultra et al 2007 segura et al 2018 use of soil amendments such as p and si li et al 2009 guo et al 2005 liu et al 2006 hossain et al 2009 zhao et al 2010 and genetics through the overexpression of peptides biovolatilization and intercrossing varieties batista et al 2014 zhao et al 2010 song et al 2010 dasgupta et al 2004 meng et al 2011 nevertheless none of these tools are perfect for example the use of microorganisms is not an easy farming practice and the polishing washing remove not only toxic elements but also important essential elements such mn fe and zn pedron et al 2019 therefore several authors study the effects of different irrigation systems on rice crop rice grown under flooded soils condition where excess water leads to increased mobilization of chemical elements has potentially increased accumulation of mineral elements ma et al 2008 xu et al 2008 the water management has been used to decrease the uptake of toxic elements by rice such as as rahaman and sinha 2013 observed a decrease of approximately 24 in the concentration of as in grains under irrigation by intermittent flooding despite the decreasing in as levels the authors also identified lower levels of fe and zn sarkar et al 2012 cultivated rice in areas with as contaminated water and soil the intermittent flooding irrigation provided the lowest levels of as in grains however the intermittent flooding irrigation causes soil oxidation raising another problem accumulation of cd inahara et al 2007 cadmium is another toxic element of great concern since it has a cumulative effect on the human organism kobayashi 1978 singh and mclaughlin 1999 from the agronomic point of view water management methods in rice alternatives to continuous flooding are beneficial as they usually decrease water demand for rice production while keeping productivity levels parfitt et al 2017 thus the intermittent flood irrigation also often referred to as awd alternate wetting and drying represents both an environmentally friendly component of rice production as well as it can contribute to food quality silva et al 2018 food security and food safety carrijo et al 2018 aiming an environmentally sustainable rice growing researchers have developed irrigation systems which demand less water in this regard many studies show the effects of the water management during rice cultivation these differentiated irrigation managements are associated to grain yield accumulation of potentially toxic elements as cd and pb genetic variation fertilization plant growth phenological phases morphology physiology planting pattern rice quality and nitrogen use arao et al 2009 zheng et al 2018 pan et al 2017 ashraf et al 2018 atwill et al 2018 the cycle of rice development also known as phenological stages comprises two periods vegetative and reproductive vegetative occurs from sowing to the beginning of floral differentiation dry seed s0 development of radicle and coleoptile s1 s2 and the appearance of the prophyll from the coleoptile s3 the vegetative phase is characterized by the development of the collar v1 and leaves appearance v2 to v13 from the stem ending just before the emergence of the flag leaf this leaf is an important structure for the development of the panicle providing energy by photosynthesis during the next phase reproductive for the development of the grains their size is correlated with grain yield the reproductive phase ranges from the initial panicle formation r0 leaf collar appearance r2 exertion of the panicle r3 and anthesis r4 to the grain development and maturation r5 r6 r7 r8 and r9 the reproductive can also be divided in r1 from the floral differentiation to the beginning of flowering and r2 from flowering to the harvest counce et al 2000 rahman et al 2013 generally the rice cycle ranges from 100 to 140 days which depends on the variety sowing time region and soil conditions sosbai 2016 therefore the aim of the present work was to determine the levels of as cd co cu fe mg mn ni pb se and zn in husked grains of three rice varieties cultivated under different soil water tensions imposed at distinct developmental phases of the crop 2 methods 2 1 characterization of the rice

according to köppen classification peel et al 2007 the annual mean of temperature and precipitation are 17 8 c and 1366 9 mm respectively embrapa 2016 2 3 rice water management the plants were cultivated under different water managements considering the phenological phases of the crop cycle vegetative vp reproductive r1 and ripening r2 the experiment was conducted in randomized blocks with split plot and four replicates per treatment phenological phases were associated to the main plot 20 m x 4 6 m soil water tension was applied to the subplots 4 6 m x 3 5 m water treatments were i continuous flooded irrigation during all phenological phases keeping a flooding depth of about 7 5 cm depth ii saturated soil soil water tension of 0 kpa iii water deficit range 0 10 kpa and iv water deficit range 0 40 kpa water management was independent for every experimental plot as example supposing the subplot ii of block 3 reached the threshold level for irrigation 10 kpa for that treatment it was irrigated back to saturation independently of the tension readings on the other replications of the same treatment furthermore there were rains in these time intervals thus making particular the mean water tension of each plot the concentration of elements in rice grains was established based on the real mean tension of each plot independently originating the regression and the respective confidence interval for the mineral content as the water tension was increased thus the water tension levels reported in the figures of the present study are based on the real mean tension of each plot of the same phenological phase 16 plots and not on the theoretical pre established water tensions 10 20 40 kpa the water management for treatments ii iii and iv were imposed to the following phenological phases vegetative period vp from v5 to r0 reproductive r1 from r1 to r4 10 days and reproductive maturation r2 from r4 10 days to r7 the phenological phases v5 5 leaves r0 panicle initiation r1 panicle differentiation r4 anthesis and r7 maturation correspond to the phenological phases stated by the scale of counce et al 2000 for the rice crop the rice varieties brs sinuelo cl puitá inta cl and brs pampa were cultivated in 2014 2015 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 seasons respectively the soil was tilled by plowing and harrowing and the sowing dates were nov 11 2014 nov 16 2015 and nov 09 2016 respectively rice was drill seeded at density of 100 kg ha 1 with rows spaced in 17 5 cm the fertilization was based on soil analysis considering the expectation for high response of the crop to fertilization for this purpose 300 kg ha 1 of n p k was applied in the sowing furrow following the formulas 5 20 30 5 20 20 and 5 25 25 for brs sinuelo cl puitá inta cl and brs pampa respectively sosbai 2016 nitrogen topdressing was divided into two applications the first in dry soil preceding the water entry in the four leaf stage v4 and the second was spread on the still water layer water was not removed prior to n topdressing at panicle initiation r0 urea 45 n was used as the source of nitrogen the other crop treatments followed the technical guide for irrigated rice sosbai 2016 flooding started at v4 4 leaf stage of rice after the first n topdressing for the implementation of the water treatments a drainage was performed at the beginning of each period of imposition of the soil water tension the subplot was irrigated again when it reached the threshold water tension by establishing a 10 cm water layer for 24 h two sensors watermark electro tensiometers irrometer co connected to a datalogger were installed per subplot at a depth of 10 cm to monitor the soil water tension during the periods when the plots as well as rice plants were not subjected to drying treatments subplots were kept flooded at approximately 7 5 cm depth however there were two more periods in which the crop remained with water layer v4 to v5 and r0 to r1 which corresponds to the period between topdressing with n 4 days after each application thus avoiding possible influence of interaction between soil water tension and n uptake by plants table 1 shows the number of times that each treatment was irrigated within the period the phenological phase r2 presented lower irrigation number since it was shorter for all cultivars the classification of counce et al 2000 was adopted to monitor the phenological phases of rice the panicle initiation r0 was considered to occur four days before panicle differentiation carli et al 2014 the grains were harvested manually threshed and pre cleaned then the samples were subjected to drying at a controlled temperature of 30 c to 13 humidity 2 4 determination of trace elements in grains the grains were husked milled ika a

spectrophotometer contra300 analytik jena germany and p by spectrophotometer model uv m51 bel photonics 2 6 statistics previously a spearman correlation was performed using all available data the correlation coefficient r ranges from 1 to 1 the strongest values are close to 1 both variables increase or 1 when one variable increases the other decreases zar 2005 also the data set was explored by regression analysis this statistical test consist in the regression adjustment between soil water tensions mean of the tension observed during the treatment period and the mineral content in the grain by using the statistical environment r rct 2016 the variables were submitted to a preliminary analysis of variance by the f test at 5 probability to verify treatment effects when any significance was found data was submitted to regression analysis only 1st degree regressions were adopted which were identified according to their levels of significance being later directly compared by their respective 95 confidence intervals according to concenço et al 2018 regressions were considered distinct in sections where their respective confidence intervals did not overlap all graphs were drawn in the r environment by using functions made available by the packages expdes and ggplot2 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil characterization and effects promoted by irrigation the facultative and anaerobic microorganisms use inorganic soil compounds as electron acceptors in their respiration thus reducing the oxidized soil components in a sequence predicted by thermodynamics buresh et al 2008 such as nitrate no3 manganese mn iv iron fe iii sulfate so4 2 these inorganic compounds are respectively reduced to n2 mn ii fe ii and s ii ponnamperuma 1972 regarding no3 reactions firstly nh4 released from mineralized organic matter or fertilizer can be diffused in the aerobic thin layer and oxidized to no3 secondly no3 diffused in the anaerobic zone the largest proportion of the submerged soil is reduced to n2 buresh et al 2008 other products of the organic matter dissimilation such as co2 are reduced to ch4 producing h bartlett and james 1993 therefore the ph redox potential eh and electrical conductivity ec are consequently altered table 3 presents the characteristics of the soils used for this study the soils presented ph 4 3 soils used for brs pampa cultivation presented the lowest ph and the highest concentration of organic matter table 2 the ph can slightly increase or decrease during rice cultivation due to the influence of co2 normally the majority of the flooded soils presents ph of approximately 7 ponnamperuma 1972 after flooding the soil redox potential eh decreases caused by biological reduction processes and the electrical conductivity ec increases reaching a maximum and decreasing to stable values the ec increasing is due to the mobilization of mn2 and fe2 and accumulation of nh4 hco3 and rcoo in addition cations adsorbed on the colloids are dislocated by fe2 mn2 and nh4 de data 1981 in the present study the soils were classified as loam soils and their characteristics were very similar among the three years of study according to the data shown in table 2 regarding the trace elements amounts the soil used for brs pampa presented the lowest levels of ca k mg fe co ni as and zn and the highest for cu table 3 all these results help understanding the minerals accumulation in the grains 3 2 concentration of chemical elements in rice grains pearson s analysis table 4 reported the following significant positive correlations co x mn

all of them were negatively correlated with as according to kabata pendias 2004 aerated higher o2 and acidic soils ph 3 present increased availability of cd zn mn and pb soil microorganisms also influence the availability and forms of elements such as and pb kabata pendias 2004 arsenic and cd present opposed behavior regarding water management with higher levels of water decreasing the cd availability and consequently its levels in grains hu et al 2013 however although the interaction between soil conditions and the impact on the mineral content in rice grains are known there is lack of information about the phenological phases of the rice development which according to our hypothesis corresponds to the higher influence on the minerals accumulation by the grains 3 3 influence of phenological phases in the absorption of potentially toxic and essential elements figs 1 3 show the regressions between the concentration of trace elements in the grains and the average soil water tensions during the considered period applied in each phenological phase regarding the potentially toxic elements fig 1 shows that the concentration of as decreased as function of the increase of water tension decreased irrigation for the three evaluated rice varieties as expected many authors observed the same effect rahaman and sinha 2013 observed a reduction of approximately 24 in the as concentration in grains under intermittent flooding they irrigated the plants during the 15th 40th days after transplantation then they waited the level of water to decrease and after 2 4 days they applied irrigation again they also evaluated other methods anaerobic cultivation and water saturated soil decreased about 22 and 21 of total as in grains respectively all these methods were compared to the common system of cultivation flooding despite the reduction of as concentrations in grains the authors also identified decreased concentration of fe and zn sarkar et al 2012 studied the intermittent flooding of rice in areas with water and soil contaminated with as bengal river india this irrigation approach was promising since the lower levels of as were accompanied by higher productivity which could be related to the reduced as toxicity to the rice plant in the present study according to fig 1 we identified that r1 is the main phenological phase responsible for the mitigation of as in the grains of the three evaluated cultivars when using the intermittent flooding as the water management approach whilst during the vp a non significant impact on as mitigation for any of the cultivars occurred for brs sinuelo cl the r2 phenological phase was not significant regarding as mitigation while for puitá inta cl beyond r1 phase the r2 phase was also significant for as mitigation lower than r1 and for brs pampa both r1 and r2 phases presented similar significance besides the rice variety the reduction ability of the soil can also influence as geodynamics by changes in the species formed or through changes related to ph organic matter mineralization and chemical reduction of iron magnesium and sulfur frohne et al 2011 rice with late stage vegetative development accumulates higher levels of inorganic arsenic i as as iii as v in grains than other plant species arsenate as v is strongly adsorbed on fe oxides of soils however in flooded soils the as v is reduced to as iii which is more weakly adsorbed by soils and consequently is readily up taken by the silicate transporters ma et al 2008 then accumulating in grains also the redox potential and sorbent content of soil amorphous fe and mn oxides are the main factors that limit the as uptake frohne et al 2011 in contrast to what happened to as mitigation increasing soil water tension significantly increased cd accumulation in all phenological phases of the three studied rice varieties as reported in fig 1 this is not a total surprise considering cd translocation ability through plants to grains arao et al 2009 ito and iimura 1976 cadmium is a potentially toxic element of significant concern since it has a cumulative effect on the human organism the consumption of rice containing high concentrations of cd leads to the disease known as itai itai and problems linked to the kidneys kobayashi 1978 singh and mclaughlin 1999 the cd availability is reduced in flooded soils once cd combines with s resulting in cds with low solubility when the soil is drained the oxidation increases converting cds into cdso4 which is more soluble and readily absorbed by the plant ito and iimura 1976 nevertheless despite the significant increase in cd concentration in the grains of the three varieties brs sinuelo cl presented cd concentrations below the maximum level ml allowed for cd in rice established by either european commission ec 2006 regulation i e 200 μg kg 1 and the three varieties presented cd concentrations below the ml for cd set by codex alimentarius of 400 μg kg 1 fao who 2017 in other words by evaluating the as mitigation pattern in the grains with increase of soil water tension we can conclude that increased cd accumulation is occurring concomitantly being the magnitude of the statistically significant phenological phases for as and cd concentrations inversely proportional namely r1 for brs sinuelo cl lowest for as and highest for cd and r1 and r2 for puitá inta cl and brs pampa moreover it is worth mentioning that although puitá inta cl was the most effective rice variety to mitigate as under higher soil water tension its cd accumulation sky rocked which exceeded by around 50 the ml set by ec 200 μg kg 1 to sum up the continuously decrease of water in soil revealed that all phenological phases vp r1 and r2 are important for cd accumulation in rice fig 1 the main phase was the r1 followed by r2 and vp for both brs sinuelo cl and puitá inta cl for brs pampa the vp was most pronounced than the r2 inahara et al 2007 observed that using the flooding system between 15 days before panicle emergence onset of flag leaf and 25 days later cd concentration in the brown rice decreased by 84 however the authors did not evaluate the presence of as on the other hand arao et al 2009 investigated the simultaneous effect on cd and as before and after the onset of the flag leaf they observed that the best irrigation management was flooding after the panicle emerged the cd concentrations in grains were lower and the total as did not change however the concentration of inorganic as increased hu et al 2013 recommended the use of the traditional cultivation system flooding type irrigation until the tillering phase appearance of lateral stems to guarantee both productivity and low concentrations of cd and as in grains lead accumulation in grains followed similar behavior of cd meaning the r1 was the most important phase for pb accumulation under increasing soil water tension fig 1 except for brs sinuelo cl which did not show any statistically significant correlation of pb accumulation or mitigation with soil water tension swt regardless the phenological phase or swt the r2 phase showed a non significant decrease in the pb levels associated with the increase in the soil water tension except for brs pampa for this rice cultivar the higher the soil water tension during the r2 phase the most effective the pb mitigation was williams et al 2009 found a positive correlation between pb and cd in rice shoot husk bran and endosperm they highlighted the accumulation in grains and the transference to the food chain moreover still in fig 1 lead accumulation also was statistically significant for puitá inta cl in vp for increased swt finally it is worth mentioning that regardless the rice cultivar nor the soil water tension pb levels in the evaluated rice grains were always lower than 40 μg kg 1 which is well below the maximum levels set for cereals of 200 μg kg 1 by both european commission and codex alimentarius commission ec 2006 fao who 2005 regarding the essential elements shown in fig 2 the higher the soil water tension the higher the cu levels in the grains of all cultivars during r1 as well as vp except for puitá inta cl which had a non significant correlation to soil water tension puitá inta cl and brs pampa presented higher levels of cu than brs sinuelo cl the cu availability is dependent on the soil ph soils with low ph values increase the cu availability li et al 2008 the presence of hco3 may be the source for the cuco3 precipitation zong and xu 2004 iron and zn concentrations in rice grains presented a weak correlation with the soil water tension fig 2 only a weak significant positive correlation between zn and soil water tension was observed in the r1 phase for brs sinuelo cl and brs pampa according to the literature the flooding reduced environment generally may increase fe and mn by reductive dissolution of fe and mn oxides other elements as cu and zn may be precipitated as sulfides under strongly reducing conditions afterwards they can be chelated by the humic acid forming partial soluble complexes ghosh and bhattacharyya 2004 other important mechanism which decreases the presence of these elements in the grains zn cu fe and others is the sequestration and storage in roots these minerals are frequently found in the vacuoles and cell walls in soluble forms from where only a small portion translocates to grains kabata pendias 2004 brun et al 2001 fig 3 shows the concentrations of mn co mg se and ni as function of the soil water tension the soil water tension increase in vp phase presented a weak negative association with the concentration of mn in grains of brs pampa the r1 was the most prominent phase for mn accumulation at higher soil water tensions for puitá inta cl and brs pampa brs sinuelo cl presented the weakest positive correlations with the increase of soil water tension in both phases r1 and r2 magnesium se and ni were determined for the varieties brs sinuelo cl puitá inta cl and brs sinuelo cl respectively fig 3 for ni the r1 was significant with positive correlation between soil water tension and concentration in grains the phases vp and r1 were significant to increase the content of se in both rice varieties at higher soil water tensions for mg no significant correlation was observed for brs sinuelo cl in general the higher availability of minerals occurs under flooding condition this fact is explained by increased diffusion and displacement of exchange sites to the soil solution such nh4 fe2 and mn2 fageria et al 2011 sahrawat 2012 magnesium and ca present increased solubility due to the displacement to the soil solution by mn and fe copper and zn also present increased solubility in flooded soils however this higher availability is compromised by the level of soluble sulfides which form precipitates sahrawat 2012 in the present study the grains accumulated the majority of chemical elements under increased soil water tension non flooded especially during r1 although the flooding present high availability of soil minerals the accumulation into grains seems to be influenced by other several variables associated to soil constitution and plant physiology cobalt is an element which present low levels in rice and rice derivatives batista et al 2010 pedron et al 2016 here the rice variety and the phenological phase were important variables for co accumulation in grains fig 3 for brs sinuelo cl no significant correlations were found regardless the soil water tension for puitá inta cl the r1 phase was determinant to increase the level of co in grains at higher soil water tensions finally brs pampa presented a significant negative correlation in the vp phase for co according to fao who it is necessary the development of new strategies to mitigate the transfer of as present in soil to rice grains irrigation management is directly related to the concentration of as in rice grains however as far as we know this is the first study which associated the impact of phenological phases soil water tension and rice varieties on the concentrations of essential and potentially toxic elements in rice grains the alteration of soil water tension was capable of changing the uptake of most of the evaluated elements in the different phenological phases in general aerobic soil higher soil water tensions promoted accumulation of cd all rice varieties tested and cu brs sinuelo cl in the vegetative phase vp however this same phenological phase at higher soil water tensions decreased the accumulation of mn and co for the cultivar brs pampa in r1 at higher water tensions the grains presented the lowest concentrations of as and the highest concentrations for cd co cu mn ni pb se and zn finally r2 at higher soil water tension increased the uptake and accumulation in the grains for brs sinuelo cl while reduced the levels of pb in brs pampa 4 summary and conclusions soil water tension variation during the reproductive period exerted the most significant influence on the trace element concentrations in rice grains irrigation management in rice is particularly related to the concentration of as cd and pb in rice grains soil aeration reduces arsenic as content while keeping cadmium cd and lead pb in acceptable levels according to fao who the higher soil water tension in vegetative phase increased cd for all varieties and cu for brs sinuelo cl contents while reducing mn and co uptake for brs pampa on the other hand the initial reproductive phase panicle initiation anthesis is the main phase regarding the uptake of chemical elements higher soil water tension in this phenological phase implied the lowest arsenic as accumulation in grains concomitantly with higher accumulation of the toxic elements cd and pb although they were kept in acceptable levels according to fao who some essential elements namely mn puita and pampa zn sinuelo and pampa se cu co puita and ni sinuelo were also favored by aerobic soils the increased soil water tension in the reproductive 2 phase anthesis ripening was important for the accumulation of cd in the three varieties and to decrease the levels of pb in brs pampa funding agencies the authors are grateful to fundação de amparo à pesquisa do estado de são paulo fapesp grants 2014 05151 0 and2016

10808,dynamic irrigation scheduling for variable rate irrigation systems is essential to accurately estimate the spatiotemporal pattern of irrigation water requirement real time sensor based and soil water balance scheduling methods were compared on a trial under a variable rate center pivot irrigation system the soil water balance scheduling used the fao56 et model to calculate daily soil water deficits and to determine crop water requirements using climate data from a local climate station the sensor based scheduling system used a wireless soil moisture sensing network to trigger irrigation when soil water deficit reached a critical value in a web based user interface the scheduling was conducted on pea and french bean crop trials under one center pivot with two delineated irrigation management zones at massey university s no 1 farm palmerston north new zealand the results showed variation between the two scheduling methods where the soil water balance assumed that the soil is well drained the sensor based scheduling technique delivered 27 45 less water as there were no significant crop growth and yield differences between the two approaches irrigation water use efficiency was greater under the sensor based scheduling regime further research is planned to assess the feasibility of including this monitoring system in a precision irrigation control system keywords precision irrigation variable rate irrigation wireless sensor network soil moisture sensors soil water balance irrigation water use efficiency water productivity 1 introduction variable rate irrigation vri systems make it possible to spatially vary water application depths across a field in a manner that addresses specific soil crop and or other conditions e g topography sequential row crop sowing by optimizing water application rates vri can meet the site specific watering needs of plants while improving the environmental outcomes of irrigated cropland evans et al 2013 some vri systems use customized irrigation zones defined on dedicated software the variable rate program is then loaded into the precision vri controller that directs individual sprinklers through valve nodes wireless or cable control system for center pivots vri is currently complemented by two techniques i speed control varies the fraction of time that the outermost tower is moving so application depth can be different in each sector of the field vri speed control one slice is one sector ii nozzle control varies the fraction of time each sprinkler or bank of sprinklers is turned on so application depth can be different angularly and radially both mechanisms may be integrated for zone control vri vri zone control one block is one management zone evans et al 2013 vri management zones have been delineated using soil apparent electrical conductivity eca maps corwin lesch 2003 this method is considered to be a rapid non destructive inexpensive and very reliable way to map soil variability at high spatial resolution corwin lesch 2003 the eca primarily relates to soil texture and moisture content mc in non saline soils and as these two soil properties relate to the soil water holding capacity eca surveys can be used to identify irrigation management zones hedley yule 2009 sudduth et al 2005 in arid regions where irrigation supplies nearly all the crop s water needs irrigation scheduling is relatively straightforward because crop water demand can be estimated without having to take into account the effects of daily variable precipitation patterns and consequent changes in mc of different soil horizons with varying drainage characteristics fant et al 2012 in humid regions such as new zealand irrigation is needed as a supplemental source of water for those times when rainfall is insufficient to meet crop water needs in these situations scheduling irrigation can be a greater challenge because it aims to reduce or eliminate crop stress due to drought as well as avoid excessive watering with the negative environmental impacts of increased drainage and nutrient leaching careful scheduling of vri can maximize irrigation water use efficiency iwue by determining the exact timing and amount of water needed to replenish the mc to a desired level in order to meet crop water demands three categories of scheduling techniques exist i soil water balance swb model calculated using meteorological data allen et al 1998 ii soil sensor measurements of mc smith 2000 and iii crop sensor measurements of plant water status jones 2004 with the swb based approach the soil water deficit swd is tracked by accounting for all water additions inputs and losses outputs from the soil root zone major inputs are precipitation and irrigation water might also be transported upward by capillary rise from a shallow water table towards the root zone allen et al 1998 outputs include crop evapotranspiration et c drainage and runoff irrigation is required when et c exceeds the supply of water from both soil water and precipitation or in other words when a critical swd level in millimeters has been reached et c is often determined as the product of the reference evapotranspiration et o and the crop coefficient k c with the et o calculated from climatic parameters allen et al 1998 accurate estimates of k c and soil hydraulic properties values are essential because inaccuracies in k c and field capacity values can potentially result in large errors in the estimated swd allen et al 1998 a standardized version of the penman and monteith pm equation fao56 allen et al 1998 is the recommended procedure for calculating et o and subsequently plant water requirements several water balance models refer to this approach for example the fao aquacrop model steduto et al 2009 and cropwat smith 1992 and it is also included in many farm system models e g overseer wheeler rutherford 2014 and apsim keating et al 2003 probert et al 1998 another major potential source of error in the widely used fao56 swb method is the uncertainty of drainage characteristics especially for poorly drained soils the method assumes that the soil is well drained and that moisture cannot exceed field capacity with free movement of soil water and other undetected fluxes in and out of the control volume fant et al 2012 nolz 2016 other models exist that may be more accurate in estimating drainage miller aarstad 1972 but these were not evaluated in this study the k c derived from remotely sensed vegetation indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi makes it possible to account for variations in plant growth due to specific growing and weather conditions and also improved swb irrigation scheduling due to better estimation of water use and more appropriate timing of irrigations kullberg et al 2017 several studies have tested the potential use of ndvi to predict k c and transpiration at the field scale duchemin et al 2006 er raki et al 2007 gonzález dugo mateos 2008 hunsaker et al 2005 these studies concluded that k c generated from ndvi determine et c better than a tabulated k c in terms of representing the actual crop growth conditions and capturing the spatial variability among different fields soil moisture can be directly measured via gravimetric sampling or estimated using a range of instruments charlesworth 2005 the gravimetric method involves collecting a soil sample weighing the sample before and after oven drying for 24 hours and calculating its mc this mc is usually expressed as the ratio of the mass of water present in the soil sample to the dry weight of the soil sample hillel 1982 this method which involves sampling transporting and repeated weighing is laborious and time consuming instruments based on the neutron probe technique and dielectric methods time domain reflectometry tdr and capacitance techniques estimate the volumetric mc smith 2000 these sensors are easy to use and provide highly reproducible data van iersel et al 2009 the neutron probe and tdr methods have been widely employed and are sometimes used as reference methods gardner 1986 vicente et al 2003 recent innovations in wireless radio frequency technologies and sensors such as those mentioned above along with advances in internet technologies offer excellent opportunities for real time monitoring of the field soil crop and environmental conditions a number of wireless sensor network wsn with various topologies e g star mesh network have been developed and investigated under irrigation by different researchers in the past decade ruiz garcia et al 2009 including center pivot irrigation o shaughnessy evett 2008 linear move irrigation systems kim et al 2008 and vri center pivot barker et al 2018 hedley et al 2013 liang et al 2016 research is required to refine decisions support tools for vri systems thus the objectives of this study were to i investigate and compare the impact of two vri scheduling methods swb model based and sensor based on the quantity of water applied crop growth final yield and iwue for a pea crop and a french bean crop over one season under a vri center pivot and ii discuss the potential improvement in the model scheduling method by using the ndvi derived from ground based data because to our knowledge this is new work that is critically required to support efficient irrigation scheduling 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted at a research site 1 2 ha 0n massey university s no 1 dairy farm near palmerston north new zealand during the 2017

management zones the electromagnetic em survey was carried out at 6 m swath widths using a dualem 1s eca at an exploration depth of 0 5 m was mapped at a 5 m spatial resolution from the em survey using ordinary kriging in r version 3 4 r core team 2016 in the gstat package pebesma 2004 2 3 experimental setup field peas cultivar massey 260 kg h 1a and french beans cultivar contender 75 kg h 1a were sown on 15 november 2017 and 9 february 2018 respectively the experiment comprised four plots 20 x 10 m in each soil zone plus two plots in a non irrigated corner of the field the crop management details for the peas and beans are shown in table 1 2 4 scheduling treatments the experiment consisted of two scheduling treatments in each zone and a non irrigated area each zone had two replicate plots per scheduling treatment the two irrigation scheduling methods were i the swb method and ii the sensor based method the non irrigated treatment was in the non irrigated corner for the swb method a daily time step water balance model was developed this model used daily weather data derived from a local climate station http cliflo niwa niwa co nz located 50 m from the trial site to calculate the daily et o et c and swd values the daily et o was calculated from the pm equation allen et al 1998 as in equation 1 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 here e t o is

tabulated coefficient values allen et al 1998 were modified to reflect local conditions at that time using equation 3 also actual readings of crop height and root depth z r i were taken during the growing season to adjust the predictions in soil data settings maximum measured rooting depth of 0 4 and 0 3 m for pea and bean respectively were used to match up with the sensor estimated swd 3 k cb

soil type against weekly measurements of mc made gravimetrically and with a neutron probe calibration equation was updated weekly the sm300 probes were installed horizontally for each plot at 4 depths i e 0 10 0 20 0 30 and 0 40 m fig 1 and 2 the neutron probes which were 1 m long were installed permanently in a vertical position close to the sm300 sensors about 1 m distance and mc readings were taken to a depth of 0 80 m in 0 10 m depth increments to calibrate the sm300 probes i there were four replicate neutron access tubes in each of the four replicate plots in each soil zone for each crop and ii three undisturbed soil sample replicates of known volume intact cores were taken close to the access tubes about 1 3 m distance at depths of 0 1 0 20 0 30 and 0 40 m the soil volumetric moisture content was determined by multiplying the gravimetric moisture content by the measured bulk density the sm300 is connected with a wsn developed by ekanayake and hedley 2019 which provides a direct continuous measurement of the mc in near real time at one hour interval and displays it on a web page http lcrmbei com index php massey soil moisture zoom 2 5 scheduling process irrigation of the plots was scheduled as follows i for the swb treatment daily weather was used to calculate the swd using equation 4 4 s w d 2 s w d 1 i r r p c r r o e t c d p where swd 1 and swd 2 is beginning

evapotranspiration mm d and dp is deep percolation or drainage out of the root zone mm the initial swd was derived from measured soil moisture content using portable tdr sensor the minitrase 6050 3 by equation 5 any excess water in the root zone 0 4 m for pea and 0 3 m for bean was assumed to be lost through dp cr was assumed to be zero because the water table was more than about 1 m below the bottom of the root zone allen et al 1998 ro was assumed to be zero ii for sensor treatments data from the calibrated mc sensors were used to monitor daily mc and calculate swd for each zone through the entire cropping season based on the crop stage average daily cumulative swd at depths of 0 20 0 30 and 0 40 m for pea and bean crops were calculated 5 s w d θ fc θ obs z r i where s w d is daily

manually on a weekly basis until harvest three replicates of 25 30 plants were monitored at each time for each plot to distinguish the impact of irrigation scheduling treatments on crop growth to investigate the impact of irrigation treatment on the final harvest yield the following process was undertaken cut three 1 m2 replicates of the aboveground plant material in each plot record number of

derived from ndvi measurements reflects the local conditions the feasibility of directly estimating the k c and predicting et c from sensor readings of ndvi was investigated and compared against the calculated k cb values using the fao56 approach a rapidscan cs 45 handheld crop sensor holland scientific lincoln ne was used to measure the ndvi at 1 m intervals along transects 1 m apart in each plot on a weekly basis the system is equipped with a gps so the data were collected and stored for analysing the ndvi differences between the plots markers were installed in each plot to allow the observations to be made at the same place from one date to another the average and the standard deviation of ndvi were computed from these measurements collected ndvi data were regressed against fao56 estimated k cb values to predict a k cb curve for the whole season taherparvar pirmoradian 2018 the curve was then used to predict daily k cb values taherparvar pirmoradian 2018 furthermore cross validation was applied to the model 2 8 soil sampling soil samples were collected before the growing season on 15 august 2016 to compare laboratory measurements of available water holding capacity awhc between the two soil zones zone 1 and zone 2 soil cores were taken from 18 locations 9 for each soil zone at 0 2 m intervals to a depth of 1 m to compare levels of soil nitrate and ammonium between treatments and their impact on crop growth three replicates of soil samples were taken at 0 15 m intervals to a depth of 0 45 m from each plot at pre planting and harvest 2 9 laboratory

ammonium and nitrate nh4 n and no3 n were extracted with 2 m kcl using a 1 10 soil extractant ratio and a 1 h end over end shake followed by filtration blackmore et al 1987 all soil preparation and laboratory analyses were undertaken at the manaaki whenua environmental chemistry laboratory palmerston north new zealand http www landcareresearch co nz resources laboratories environmental chemistry laboratory 2 10 statistical analysis the kolmogorov smirnov test of normality ks was carried out at 5 significance analysis of variance anova at p 0 05 tukey s hsd data normally distributed and bonferroni dunn data non normal distributed were conducted to investigate significant differences in measured soil properties and crop measurements all the data visualizations and analyses performed in this study were carried out using r r core team 2016 and sas version 9 4 sas institute inc 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 delineating the field into irrigation management zones the dualem 1s sensor data were kriged into an eca map and classified into two irrigation management zones zone 1 and 2 see fig 2 table 2 the relationships between eca values and soil properties mc and cation exchange capacity cec were established for this field site by el naggar et al 2017 who measured linear relationships of eca with mc and cec r 2 0 66 for mc and r 2 0 63 for cec the form of linear regression was i mc 0 08 0 03 eca and ii cec 2 86 1 09 eca 3 2 comparison of soil data for the two soil zones the significance of differences in these properties between the two soil zones was evaluated by both parametric and non parametric statistical methods the ks test only demonstrated non normality in the awhc of samples at 0 8 1 m there was no significant difference in mean awhc in the top 0 2 m at deeper depths 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 0 8 and 0 8 1 m the mean values of awhc were larger in zone 2 than in zone 1 with p values 0 05 fig 3 zone 1 was a coarser textured sandy soil and had a relatively low awhc compared with zone 2 table 2 illustrates the textural distribution and classification of the 18 samples along with the eca classes for the 0 0 4 m soil layer for zone 1 the sand percentage was always greater than 45 the clay percentages were always lower than 14 and the silt percentages ranged between 7 and 38 for zone 2 the sand percentage was always less than 42 the clay percentages were lower than 23 and the silt percentages ranged between 41 and 65 these analyses gave weight to the claim that the soil differences between the two soil zones were practically and statistically significant 3 3 irrigation scheduling for the two scheduling treatments in each zone the details of the ad and irr values for the two scheduling criteria are given in table 3 sensors were calibrated weekly from neutron probe readings fig 4 shows an example of the calibration curves for the sensors over the rooting depth of the crop 0 to 0 4 m against neutron measured volumetric data on 24 january 2018 and 3 april 2018 for pea and bean crops respectively separate calibrations were needed for each soil type the relationship between the two regression lines for zone 1 and 2 was significantly different p 0 0312 the results showed good agreement for swd in the top 0 40 m an r 2 value of 0 87 and 0 89 with root mean square errors rmse of 1 8 and 1 95 mm 400 mm were obtained for zone 1 and zone 2 respectively the relationship for mc of the top 0 20 m varied with the subsoil below 0 20 0 40 m for zone 1 compared with zone 2 fig 4 and table 4 which was likely due to the variable soil texture and taw below 0 20 m at zone 1 compared with zone 2 as observed by el naggar et al 2017 we suggest that the higher scatter in the 0 30 m depth in zone 1 r 2 0 74 rmse 1 24 mm 10 mm was due to heterogeneity of the soil or poor installation of sensors the average mean square errors mse for mc measurements for the 0 0 40 m depth during the crop season in each soil zone is given in fig 5 the associated standard error of the mean was less for the neutron probe for both soil zones due to its ability to integrate over a larger volume of soil and its higher tolerance of the heterogeneity of the soil not shown the mse was higher in zone 2 especially in the control plots for the bean the error was in general less in the zone 1 plots during the pea trial for both sensors probably because greater water demand summer season helped homogenize soil moisture in the root zones the soils under this condition retained water over a longer period after each irrigation event leading to more stable moisture profiles by decreasing the rates of soil moisture loss similar findings by heng et al 2002 reported that the errors of a capacitance probe and neutron probe were less under a higher fertility irrigation treatment because of higher root water extraction giving more homogenized soil moisture however the corresponding error at each depth showed rather low mse values especially at 0 10 0 20 m depths for both soil zones not shown based on this to obtain the same level of precision in zone 2 as observed in zone 1 more sensors are needed irrigation events for each zone under the two scheduling methods for the pea and bean crops are shown in figs 6 and 7 during the pea trial the swb method scheduled 6 and 5 irrigation events to zone 1 and zone 2 respectively with a total amount of 110 and 97 mm for zone 1 and zone 2 respectively the sensor method scheduled 5 and 3 for irrigation events to zone 1 and zone 2 respectively with a total amount of 85 and 53 mm for zone 1 and zone 2 respectively most irrigation occurred in the first part of the season when rainfall was insufficient to meet the crop water demand compared with the water balance method the sensor based technique reduced withdrawal by 27 of the irrigation water in zone 1 and 45 in zone 2 we attributed these observed variations between the two methods to varying features of the soil profiles zone 2 with restricted drainage stayed wetter than predicted by the swb model figs 6 and 8 which is likely due to the fact that the swb model did not take into account the impact of the layering and capillary break due to the coarse gravels below the subsoil as described by clothier et al 1977 for this soil type this leads to an increase in mc in the finer layer above the coarse gravel surface that the sensors were able to measure but the swb was unable to account for during the bean trial the rainfall was greater so less irrigation was required the swb method scheduled only 2 and 1 irrigation events for zone 1 and zone 2 respectively with a total amount of 35 and 20 mm for zone 1 and zone 2 respectively the sensor method scheduled the same number of irrigation events and the same application depths as the swb method following the bean trial the sensors identified that the mc was above field capacity due to a heavy rainfall event of 75 mm that fell over 3 days however if daily rainfall wets the soil above field capacity then the swb model assumes that the total amount of water surplus to field capacity is lost the same day by deep percolation allowing the soil to return to field capacity fant et al 2012 in reality the soils at this site did not drain this rapidly this could also be related to the limitations of laboratory estimates of soil water limits i e fc and awhc used in swb ratliff et al 1983 suggested that laboratory estimated mc limits should be used with caution in swb calculations and field measured limits are preferred gebregiorgis and savage 2006 lukangu et al 1999 concluded that for approximate estimation of mc limits the laboratory method using undisturbed soil cores yields satisfactory results but for more critical work the use of the direct measurement is essential using mc or soil water potential sensors ekanayake and hedley 2019 salter and haworth 1961 also found that the sensors and or field method for estimating mc are practical and give more accurate measurements for timing and amount of irrigation in general these results indicate that the timing of the irrigation events varied under the two methods and that the swb method resulted in more water being applied to the pea crop 3 4 crop assessment for the two scheduling treatments in each zone for the pea crop there was no significant difference in mean crop height number of pods see fig 9 length number of nodes and number of flowers results not included between the two scheduling treatments during the pea crop trial the non irrigated crop s height and number of pods were significantly less than those observed for the two scheduling treatments unsurprisingly the greater rainfall experienced during the growing of the bean crop resulted in no significant differences in crop height and number of pods between the two scheduling treatments and the non irrigated treatment the yield and biomass results indicated there were no significant differences p 0 05 among the scheduling treatments for pea and bean crops table 5 the mean yields were 2 43 t h 1a for the swb treatments standard deviation 0 01 t h 1a and 2 33 t h 1a standard deviation 0 02 t h 1a for the sensor treatments yield differences in peas were observed between the two irrigation scheduling treatments and the non irrigated treatment the yield of the non irrigated treatment decreased by approximately 80 for the pea crop table 5 3 5 irrigation water use efficiency for the two scheduling treatments in each zone in the pea trial iwue increased by 0 5 kg m 13 for zone 1 and 1 5 kg m 13 for zone 2 for the sensor based treatment compared with the model based scheduling fig 10 in the bean trial iwue was not significantly different between both scheduling treatments there were no differences in crop wp between sensor based and swb based treatments for either crop 3 6 soil nitrate content for the two soil zones all plots received the same adequate amount of n fertilizer at the beginning of the season to ensure any yield differences could be related to different irrigation schedules and not to fertility differences we also measured the soil n content at pre planting and harvest to check for any impacts of residual n differences there was no significant difference in the quantities of no3 n and nh4 n in the upper 0 45 m of soil between the treatments at harvest for both crop trials table 6 3 7 evaluation of ndvi readings to refine fao56 crop coefficient values the results of the regression analysis between fao56 estimated k cb values and ndvi values are provided in table 7 these equations were used to predict more accurate pea and bean k cb and et c estimates the analysis shows that for ndvi the estimated k cb and predicted k cb had the same trend through the growing season table 7 and fig 11 the et c was calculated by multiplying the k c values by the value of the et o see equation 2 the estimation of k cb and et c using ndvi sensing data was essentially significant the results show high r 2 and adjusted r 2 for the predicted values of k cb for pea and bean 0 87 and 0 92 respectively the ndvi minimum value was measured at the beginning of the growing season over the dry bare soil and was about 0 16 and 0 14 for the pea and bean crops respectively ndvi maximum values were 0 80 and 0 72 for the pea and bean crops respectively the ndvi increased from crop emergence until maximum values were attained about 50 d after planting and then they began to decrease slightly through to the end of the season fig 11 the ndvi curves flatten out at mid season where the ndvi saturates with high values of leaf area index when the soil was almost totally covered by the canopy duchemin et al 2006 the ndvi values were slightly higher for the pea irrigation treatments than the bean irrigation treatments especially during the mid season and this is likely due to the dense canopy of the pea crop compared with the bean crop at times the heterogeneity of ndvi data in crops with low values was visible at high spatial scale resolution imagery particularly for the non irrigated treatment not shown k cb ndvi values were interpolated at a daily time step in order to compare them with the continuous series of k cb fao56 values for the entire growing season the result of the comparison is displayed in fig 11 the k cb fao56 average values obtained at three stages initial mid season and late season were 0 15 1 17 and 1 05 respectively these values are only slightly different from those given by k cb ndvi k cb ini 0 14 k cb mid 1 10 k cb end 1 03 which reflect the local conditions overall the estimated et c by ndvi did not significantly improve the fao56 approach the fao56 model has mainly been designed to plan irrigation schedules in arid to semi arid regions thus the model requires a limited set of soil inputs does not account for any vertical differences in soil moisture and assumes that the soil moisture cannot exceed field capacity in order to improve the utility of the model in the widest range of soil types the model should include a multi layer soil feature that accounts for slower drainage rates and the associated water storage especially in temperate regions when rainfall often occurs during the irrigation season in some cases the model should consist of detailed soil crop weather and management modules e g apsim keating et al 2003 and dssat jones et al 2003 that require very accurate and numerous inputs all of which tend to vary dramatically from one field to another 4 conclusions dynamic irrigation scheduling is required to help farmers meet the site specific water requirements of plants and reduce the negative environmental impacts of irrigation swb based and sensor based techniques were used to schedule irrigations to pea and bean crops in two delineated irrigation management zones of contrasting soil texture under a vri system in addition a potential improvement of the fao56 scheduling approach was evaluated by using k cb derived from sensor readings of ndvi daily swd was monitored using two contrasting techniques swb based modelling and sensors and irrigation was triggered when a prescribed ad was reached the swb based model relied on soil taw and weather data the sensor based method which used a wireless soil moisture sensor network provided measurements of the actual soil water conditions in the field the two scheduling methods showed a variation in timing and the quantity of irrigation applied to the pea crop the swb based method resulted in more water being applied the sensor based technique saved about 27 45 of the irrigation water and produced the same pea yields as the swb based model this difference can be attributed to some of the inherent limitations of a simple swb in the period following a rain event that wet the soils above field capacity the swb models predicted a faster drying rate than was actually measured with the soil moisture sensors this is because the swb model does not account for the restricted drainage that occurs in the manawatū silt loam soil profile zone 2 this restricted drainage is due to the compact nature of the silt loam subsoil as well as the impact of the textural break that occurs between the base of the subsoil and the underlying coarser gravels the estimated et c by k cb ndvi did not significantly improve the fao56 approach crop growth was not significantly different between the two scheduling treatments therefore the iwue for the pea crop was significantly more efficient for the sensor based technique compared with the swb technique for scheduling irrigation future research could be undertaken to extend the comparison of these two scheduling systems to different crops and for different climatic conditions in addition future research is required to investigate the value of including wsn monitoring systems into precision irrigation software control systems to increase

10808,dynamic irrigation scheduling for variable rate irrigation systems is essential to accurately estimate the spatiotemporal pattern of irrigation water requirement real time sensor based and soil water balance scheduling methods were compared on a trial under a variable rate center pivot irrigation system the soil water balance scheduling used the fao56 et model to calculate daily soil water deficits and to determine crop water requirements using climate data from a local climate station the sensor based scheduling system used a wireless soil moisture sensing network to trigger irrigation when soil water deficit reached a critical value in a web based user interface the scheduling was conducted on pea and french bean crop trials under one center pivot with two delineated irrigation management zones at massey university s no 1 farm palmerston north new zealand the results showed variation between the two scheduling methods where the soil water balance assumed that the soil is well drained the sensor based scheduling technique delivered 27 45 less water as there were no significant crop growth and yield differences between the two approaches irrigation water use efficiency was greater under the sensor based scheduling regime further research is planned to assess the feasibility of including this monitoring system in a precision irrigation control system keywords

irrigation vri systems make it possible to spatially vary water application depths across a field in a manner that addresses specific soil crop and or other conditions e g topography sequential row crop sowing by optimizing water application rates vri can meet the site specific watering needs of plants while improving the environmental outcomes of irrigated cropland evans et al 2013 some vri systems use customized irrigation zones defined on dedicated software the variable rate program is then loaded into the precision vri controller that directs individual sprinklers through valve nodes wireless or cable control system for center pivots vri is currently complemented by two techniques i speed control varies the fraction of time that the outermost tower is moving so application depth can be different in each sector of the field vri speed control one slice is one sector ii nozzle control varies the fraction of time each sprinkler or bank of sprinklers is turned on so application depth can be different angularly and radially both mechanisms may be integrated for zone control vri vri zone control one block is one management zone evans et al 2013 vri management zones have been delineated using soil apparent electrical conductivity eca maps corwin lesch 2003 this method is considered to be a rapid non destructive inexpensive and very reliable way to map soil variability at high spatial resolution corwin lesch 2003 the eca primarily relates to soil texture and moisture content mc in non saline soils and as these two soil properties relate to the soil water holding capacity eca surveys can be used to identify irrigation management zones hedley yule 2009 sudduth et al 2005 in arid regions where irrigation supplies nearly all the crop s water needs irrigation scheduling is relatively straightforward because crop water demand can be estimated without having to take into account the effects of daily variable precipitation patterns and consequent changes in mc of different soil horizons with varying drainage characteristics fant et al 2012 in humid regions such as new zealand irrigation is needed as a supplemental source of water for those times when rainfall is insufficient to meet crop water needs in these situations scheduling irrigation can be a greater challenge because it aims to reduce or eliminate crop stress due to drought as well as avoid excessive watering with the negative environmental impacts of increased drainage and nutrient leaching careful scheduling of vri can maximize irrigation water use efficiency iwue by determining the exact timing and amount of water needed to replenish the mc to a desired level in order to meet crop water demands three categories of scheduling techniques exist i soil water balance swb model calculated using meteorological data allen et al 1998 ii soil sensor measurements of mc smith 2000 and iii crop sensor measurements of plant water status jones 2004 with the swb based approach the soil water deficit swd is tracked by accounting for all water additions inputs and losses outputs from the soil root zone major inputs are precipitation and irrigation water might also be transported upward by capillary rise from a shallow water table towards the root zone allen et al 1998 outputs include crop evapotranspiration et c drainage and runoff irrigation is required when et c exceeds the supply of water from both soil water and precipitation or in other words when a critical swd level in millimeters has been reached et c is often determined as the product of the reference evapotranspiration et o and the crop coefficient k c with the et o calculated from climatic parameters allen et al 1998 accurate estimates of k c and soil hydraulic properties values are essential because inaccuracies in k c and field capacity values can potentially result in large errors in the estimated swd allen et al 1998 a standardized version of the penman and monteith pm equation fao56 allen et al 1998 is the recommended procedure for calculating et o and subsequently plant water requirements several water balance models refer to this approach for example the fao aquacrop model steduto et al 2009 and cropwat smith 1992 and it is also included in many farm system models e g overseer wheeler rutherford 2014 and apsim keating et al 2003 probert et al 1998 another major potential source of error in the widely used fao56 swb method is the uncertainty of drainage characteristics especially for poorly drained soils the method assumes that the soil is well drained and that moisture cannot exceed field capacity with free movement of soil water and other undetected fluxes in and out of the control volume fant et al 2012 nolz 2016 other models exist that may be more accurate in estimating drainage miller aarstad 1972 but these were not evaluated in this study the k c derived from remotely sensed vegetation indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi makes it possible to account for variations in plant growth due to specific growing and weather conditions and also improved swb irrigation scheduling due to better estimation of water use and more appropriate timing of irrigations kullberg et al 2017 several studies have tested the potential use of ndvi to predict k c and transpiration at the field scale duchemin et al 2006 er raki et al 2007 gonzález dugo mateos 2008 hunsaker et al 2005 these studies concluded that k c generated from ndvi determine et c better than a tabulated k c in terms of representing the actual crop growth conditions and capturing the spatial variability among different fields soil moisture can be directly measured via gravimetric sampling or estimated using a range of instruments charlesworth 2005 the gravimetric method involves collecting a soil sample weighing the sample before and after oven drying for 24 hours and calculating its mc this mc is usually expressed as the ratio of the mass of water present in the soil sample to the dry weight of the soil sample hillel 1982 this method which involves sampling transporting and repeated weighing is laborious and time consuming instruments based on the neutron probe technique and dielectric methods time domain reflectometry tdr and capacitance techniques estimate the volumetric mc smith 2000 these sensors are easy to use and provide highly reproducible data van iersel et al 2009 the neutron probe and tdr methods have been widely employed and are sometimes used as reference methods gardner 1986 vicente et al 2003 recent innovations in wireless radio frequency technologies and sensors such as those mentioned above along with advances in internet technologies offer excellent opportunities for real time monitoring of the field soil crop and environmental conditions a number of wireless sensor network wsn with various topologies e g star mesh network have been developed and investigated under irrigation by different researchers in the past decade ruiz garcia et al 2009 including center pivot irrigation o shaughnessy evett 2008 linear move irrigation systems kim et al 2008 and vri center pivot barker et al 2018 hedley et al 2013 liang et al 2016 research is required to refine decisions support tools for vri systems thus the objectives of this study were to i investigate and compare the impact of two vri scheduling

the potential improvement in the model scheduling method by using the ndvi derived from ground based data because to our knowledge this is new work that is critically required to support efficient irrigation scheduling 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted at a research site 1 2 ha 0n massey university s no 1 dairy farm near palmerston north new zealand during the 2017 2018 growing season the farm is located at 40 22 south latitude and 175 36 east longitude at an elevation of 37 m above sea level the field is currently irrigated with an 86 m vri center pivot system i e 1 span containing 31 sprinklers each with a spray radius of 5 m and a flow rate of 26 3 m3 h 1 the water is sourced from groundwater in a nearby well according to the new zealand soil classification hewitt 2010 the soils are fluvial recent soils formed in greywacke alluvium which correspond to fluvents in the usda soil taxonomy usda 1975 2 2 irrigation management zones the soil map for this field pollok and nelson 2003 shows the presence of two soil types a manawatū fine sandy loam and a manawatū silt loam eca maps were used to delineate the field precisely into irrigation management zones the electromagnetic em survey was carried out at 6 m swath widths using a dualem 1s eca at an exploration depth of 0 5 m was mapped at a 5 m spatial resolution from the em survey using ordinary kriging in r version 3 4 r core team 2016 in the gstat package pebesma 2004 2 3 experimental setup field peas cultivar massey 260 kg h 1a and french beans cultivar contender 75 kg h 1a were sown on 15 november 2017 and 9 february 2018 respectively the experiment comprised four plots 20 x 10 m in each soil zone plus two plots in a non irrigated corner of the field the crop management details for the peas and beans are shown in table 1 2 4 scheduling treatments the experiment consisted of two scheduling treatments in each zone and a non irrigated area each zone had two replicate plots per scheduling treatment the two irrigation scheduling methods were i the swb method and ii the sensor based method the non irrigated treatment was in the non irrigated corner for the swb method a daily time step water balance model was developed this model used daily weather data derived from a local climate station http cliflo niwa niwa co nz located 50 m from the trial site to calculate the daily et o et c and swd values the daily et o was calculated from the pm equation allen et al 1998 as in equation 1 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 here e t o is

the root zone z r i respectively according to allen et al 1998 crop coefficients k c and k cb vary according to the crop growth stage and are also affected by the climate conditions the standard tabulated coefficient values allen et al 1998 were modified to reflect local conditions at that time using equation 3 also actual readings of crop height and root depth z r i were taken during the growing season to adjust the predictions in soil data settings maximum measured rooting depth of 0 4 and 0 3 m for pea and bean respectively were used to match up with the sensor estimated swd 3 k cb

soil type against weekly measurements of mc made gravimetrically and with a neutron probe calibration equation was updated weekly the sm300 probes were installed horizontally for each plot at 4 depths i e 0 10 0 20 0 30 and 0 40 m fig 1 and 2 the neutron probes which were 1 m long were installed permanently in a vertical position close to the sm300 sensors about 1 m distance and mc readings were taken to a depth of 0 80 m in 0 10 m depth increments to calibrate the sm300 probes i there were four replicate neutron access tubes in each of the four replicate plots in each soil zone for each crop and ii three undisturbed soil sample replicates of known volume intact cores were taken close to the access tubes about 1 3 m distance at depths of 0 1 0 20 0 30 and 0 40 m the soil volumetric moisture content was determined by multiplying the gravimetric moisture content by the measured bulk density the sm300 is connected with a wsn developed by ekanayake and hedley 2019 which provides a direct continuous measurement of the mc in near real time at one hour interval and displays it on a web page http lcrmbei com index php massey soil moisture zoom 2 5 scheduling process irrigation of the plots was scheduled as follows i for the swb treatment daily weather was used to calculate the swd using equation 4 4 s w d 2 s w d 1 i r r p c r r o e t c d p where swd 1 and swd 2 is beginning

evapotranspiration mm d and dp is deep percolation or drainage out of the root zone mm the initial swd was derived from measured soil moisture content using portable tdr sensor the minitrase 6050 3 by equation 5 any excess water in the root zone 0 4 m for pea and 0 3 m for bean was assumed to be lost through dp cr was assumed to be zero because the water table was more than about 1 m below the bottom of the root zone allen et al 1998 ro was assumed to be zero ii for sensor treatments data from the calibrated mc sensors were used to monitor daily mc and calculate swd for each zone through the entire cropping season based on the crop stage average daily cumulative swd at depths of 0 20 0 30 and 0 40 m for pea and bean crops were calculated 5 s w d θ fc θ obs z r i where s w d is daily

the total available water taw equation 6 for each treatment when allowable deficit ad level was reached an irrigation event was scheduled ad levels were determined for both scheduling methods as 0 45

manually on a weekly basis until harvest three replicates of 25 30 plants were monitored at each time for each plot to distinguish the impact of irrigation scheduling treatments on crop growth to investigate the impact of irrigation treatment on the final harvest yield the following process was undertaken cut three 1 m2 replicates of the aboveground plant material in each plot record number of

biomass and yield were calculated on an oven dry weight basis 70⁰c to compare the effect of scheduling technique on crop water productivity the iwue howell 2002 and water productivity wp were

derived from ndvi measurements reflects the local conditions the feasibility of directly estimating the k c and predicting et c from sensor readings of ndvi was investigated and compared against the calculated k cb values using the fao56 approach a rapidscan cs 45 handheld crop sensor holland scientific lincoln ne was used to measure the ndvi at 1 m intervals along transects 1 m apart in each plot on a weekly basis the system is equipped with a gps so the data were collected and stored for analysing the ndvi differences between the plots markers were installed in each plot to allow the observations to be made at the same place from one date to another the average and the standard deviation of ndvi were computed from these measurements collected ndvi data were regressed against fao56 estimated k cb values to predict a k cb curve for the whole season taherparvar pirmoradian 2018 the curve was then used to predict daily k cb values taherparvar pirmoradian 2018 furthermore cross validation was applied to the model 2 8 soil sampling soil samples were collected before the growing season on 15 august 2016 to compare laboratory measurements of available water holding capacity awhc between the two soil zones zone 1 and zone 2 soil cores were taken from 18 locations 9 for each soil zone at 0 2 m intervals to a depth of 1 m to compare levels of soil nitrate and ammonium between treatments and their impact on crop growth three replicates of soil samples were taken at 0 15 m intervals to a depth of 0 45 m from each plot at pre planting and harvest 2 9 laboratory analysis laboratory analysis included measurements of i awhc by draining a proportion of soil volume between pressure potentials of 10 and 1500 kpa gardner 1986 mcqueen 1993 ii mineral nitrogen ammonium and nitrate nh4 n and no3 n were extracted with 2 m kcl using a 1 10 soil extractant ratio and a 1 h end over end shake followed by filtration blackmore et al 1987 all soil preparation and laboratory analyses were undertaken at the manaaki whenua environmental chemistry laboratory palmerston north new zealand http www landcareresearch co nz resources laboratories environmental chemistry laboratory 2 10 statistical analysis the kolmogorov smirnov test of normality ks was carried out at 5 significance analysis of variance anova at p 0 05 tukey s hsd data normally distributed and bonferroni dunn data non normal distributed were conducted to investigate significant differences in measured soil properties and crop measurements all the data visualizations and analyses performed in this study were carried out using r r core team 2016 and sas version 9 4 sas institute inc 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 delineating the field into irrigation management zones the dualem 1s sensor data were kriged into an eca map and classified into two irrigation management zones zone 1 and 2 see fig 2 table 2 the relationships between eca values and soil properties mc and cation exchange capacity cec were established for this field site by el naggar et al 2017 who measured linear relationships of eca with mc and cec r 2 0 66 for mc and r 2 0 63 for cec the form of linear regression was i mc 0 08 0 03 eca and ii cec 2 86 1 09 eca 3 2 comparison of soil data for the two soil zones the significance of differences in these properties between the two soil zones was evaluated by both parametric and non parametric statistical methods the ks test only demonstrated non normality in the awhc of samples at 0 8 1 m there was no significant difference in mean awhc in the top 0 2 m at deeper depths 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 0 8 and 0 8 1 m the mean values of awhc were larger in zone 2 than in zone 1 with p values 0 05 fig 3 zone 1 was a coarser textured sandy soil and had a relatively low awhc compared with zone 2 table 2 illustrates the textural distribution and classification of the 18 samples along with the eca classes for the 0 0 4 m soil layer for zone 1 the sand percentage was always greater than 45 the clay percentages were always lower than 14 and the silt percentages ranged between 7 and 38 for zone 2 the sand percentage was always less than 42 the clay percentages were lower than 23 and the silt percentages ranged between 41 and 65 these analyses gave weight to the claim that the soil differences between the two soil zones were practically and statistically significant 3 3 irrigation scheduling for the two scheduling treatments in each zone the details of the ad and irr values for the two scheduling criteria are given in table 3 sensors were calibrated weekly from neutron probe readings fig 4 shows an example of the calibration curves for the sensors over the rooting depth of the crop 0 to 0 4 m against neutron measured volumetric data on 24 january 2018 and 3 april 2018 for pea and bean crops respectively separate calibrations were needed for each soil type the relationship between the two regression lines for zone 1 and 2 was significantly different p 0 0312 the results showed good agreement for swd in the top 0 40 m an r 2 value of 0 87 and 0 89 with root mean square errors rmse of 1 8 and 1 95 mm 400 mm were obtained for zone 1 and zone 2 respectively the relationship for mc of the top 0 20 m varied with the subsoil below 0 20 0 40 m for zone 1 compared with zone 2 fig 4 and table 4 which was likely due to the variable soil texture and taw below 0 20 m at zone 1 compared with zone 2 as observed by el naggar et al 2017 we suggest that the higher scatter in the 0 30 m depth in zone 1 r 2 0 74 rmse 1 24 mm 10 mm was due to heterogeneity of the soil or poor installation of sensors the average mean square errors mse for mc measurements for the 0 0 40 m depth during the crop season in each soil zone is given in fig 5 the associated standard error of the mean was less for the neutron probe for both soil zones due to its ability to integrate over a larger volume of soil and its higher tolerance of the heterogeneity of the soil not shown the mse was higher in zone 2 especially in the control plots for the bean the error was in general less in the zone 1 plots during the pea trial for both sensors probably because greater water demand summer season helped homogenize soil moisture in the root zones the soils under this condition retained water over a longer period after each irrigation event leading to more stable moisture profiles by decreasing the rates of soil moisture loss similar findings by heng et al 2002 reported that the errors of a capacitance probe and neutron probe were less under a higher fertility irrigation treatment because of higher root water extraction giving more homogenized soil moisture however the corresponding error at each depth showed rather low mse values especially at 0 10 0 20 m depths for both soil zones not shown based on this to obtain the same level of precision in zone 2 as observed in zone 1 more sensors are needed irrigation events for each zone under the two scheduling methods for the pea and bean crops are shown in figs 6 and 7 during the pea trial the swb method scheduled 6 and 5 irrigation events to zone 1 and zone 2 respectively with a total amount of 110 and 97 mm for zone 1 and zone 2 respectively the sensor method scheduled 5 and 3 for irrigation events to zone 1 and zone 2 respectively with a total amount of 85 and 53 mm for zone 1 and zone 2 respectively most irrigation occurred in the first part of the season when rainfall was insufficient to meet the crop water demand compared with the water balance method the sensor based technique reduced withdrawal by 27 of the irrigation water in zone 1 and 45 in zone 2 we attributed these observed variations between the two methods to varying features of the soil profiles zone 2 with restricted drainage stayed wetter than predicted by the swb model figs 6 and 8 which is likely due to the fact that the swb model did not take into account the impact of the layering and capillary break due to the coarse gravels below the subsoil as described by clothier et al 1977 for this soil type this leads to an increase in mc in the finer layer above the coarse gravel surface that the sensors were able to measure but the swb was unable to account for during the bean trial the rainfall was greater so less irrigation was required the swb method scheduled only 2 and 1 irrigation events for zone 1 and zone 2 respectively with a total amount of 35 and 20 mm for zone 1 and zone 2 respectively the sensor method scheduled the same number of irrigation events and the same application depths as the swb method following the bean trial the sensors identified that the mc was above field capacity due to a heavy rainfall event of 75 mm that fell over 3 days however if daily rainfall wets the soil above field capacity then the swb model assumes that the total amount of water surplus to field capacity is lost the same day by deep percolation allowing the soil to return to field capacity fant et al 2012 in reality the soils at this site did not drain this rapidly this could also be related to the limitations of laboratory estimates of soil water limits i e fc and awhc used in swb ratliff et al 1983 suggested that laboratory estimated mc limits should be used with caution in swb calculations and field measured limits are preferred gebregiorgis and savage 2006 lukangu et al 1999 concluded that for approximate estimation of mc limits the laboratory method using undisturbed soil cores yields satisfactory results but for more critical work the use of the direct measurement is essential using mc or soil water potential sensors ekanayake and hedley 2019 salter and haworth 1961 also found that the sensors and or field method for estimating mc are practical and give more accurate measurements for timing and amount of irrigation in general these results indicate that the timing of the irrigation events varied under the two methods and that the swb method resulted in more water being applied to the pea crop 3 4 crop assessment for the two scheduling treatments in each zone for the pea crop there was no significant difference in mean crop height number of pods see fig 9 length number of nodes and number of flowers results not included between the two scheduling treatments during the pea crop trial the non irrigated crop s height and number of pods were significantly less than those observed for the two scheduling treatments unsurprisingly the greater rainfall experienced during the growing of the bean crop resulted in no significant differences in crop height and number of pods between the two scheduling treatments and the non irrigated treatment the yield and biomass results indicated there were no significant differences p 0 05 among the scheduling treatments for pea and bean crops table 5 the mean yields were 2 43 t h 1a for the swb treatments standard deviation 0 01 t h 1a and 2 33 t h 1a standard deviation 0 02 t h 1a for the sensor treatments yield differences in peas were observed between the two irrigation scheduling treatments and the non irrigated treatment the yield of the non irrigated treatment decreased by approximately 80 for the pea crop table 5 3 5 irrigation water use efficiency for the two scheduling treatments in each zone in the pea trial iwue increased by 0 5 kg m 13 for zone 1 and 1 5 kg m 13 for zone 2 for the sensor based treatment compared with the model based scheduling fig 10 in the bean trial iwue was not significantly different between both scheduling treatments there were no differences in crop wp between sensor based and swb based treatments for either crop 3 6 soil nitrate content for the two soil zones all plots received the same adequate amount of n fertilizer at the beginning of the season to ensure any yield differences could be related to different irrigation schedules and not to fertility differences we also measured the soil n content at pre planting and harvest to check for any impacts of residual n differences there was no significant difference in the quantities of no3 n and nh4 n in the upper 0 45 m of soil between the treatments at harvest for both crop trials table 6 3 7 evaluation of ndvi readings to refine fao56 crop coefficient values the results of the regression analysis between fao56 estimated k cb values and ndvi values are provided in table 7 these equations were used to predict more accurate pea and bean k cb and et c estimates the analysis shows that for ndvi the estimated k cb and predicted k cb had the same trend through the growing season table 7 and fig 11 the et c was calculated by multiplying the k c values by the value of the et o see equation 2 the estimation of k cb and et c using ndvi sensing data was essentially significant the results show high r 2 and adjusted r 2 for the predicted values of k cb for pea and bean 0 87 and 0 92 respectively the ndvi minimum value was measured at the beginning of the growing season over the dry bare soil and was about 0 16 and 0 14 for the pea and bean crops respectively ndvi maximum values were 0 80 and 0 72 for the pea and bean crops respectively the ndvi increased from crop emergence until maximum values were attained about 50 d after planting and then they began to decrease slightly through to the end of the season fig 11 the ndvi curves flatten out at mid season where the ndvi saturates with high values of leaf area index when the soil was almost totally covered by the canopy duchemin et al 2006 the ndvi values were slightly higher for the pea irrigation treatments than the bean irrigation treatments especially during the mid season and this is likely due to the dense canopy of the pea crop compared with the bean crop at times the heterogeneity of ndvi data in crops with low values was visible at high spatial scale resolution imagery particularly for the non irrigated treatment not shown k cb ndvi values were interpolated at a daily time step in order to compare them with the continuous series of k cb fao56 values for the entire growing season the result of the comparison is displayed in fig 11 the k cb fao56 average values obtained at three stages initial mid season and late season were 0 15 1 17 and 1 05 respectively these values are only slightly different from those given by k cb ndvi k cb ini 0 14 k cb mid 1 10 k cb end 1 03 which reflect the local conditions overall the estimated et c by ndvi did not significantly improve the fao56 approach the fao56 model has mainly been designed to plan irrigation schedules in arid to semi arid regions thus the model requires a limited set of soil inputs does not account for any vertical differences in soil moisture and assumes that the soil moisture cannot exceed field capacity in order to improve the utility of the model in the widest range of soil types the model should include a multi layer soil feature that accounts for slower drainage rates and the associated water storage especially in temperate regions when rainfall often occurs during the irrigation season in some cases the model should consist of detailed soil crop weather and management modules e g apsim keating et al 2003 and dssat jones et al 2003 that require very accurate and numerous inputs all of which tend to vary dramatically from one field to another 4 conclusions dynamic irrigation scheduling is required to help farmers meet the site specific water requirements of plants and reduce the negative environmental impacts of irrigation swb based and sensor based techniques were used to schedule irrigations to pea and bean crops in two delineated irrigation management zones of contrasting soil texture under a vri system in addition a potential improvement of the fao56 scheduling approach was evaluated by using k cb derived from sensor readings of ndvi daily swd was monitored using two contrasting techniques swb based modelling and sensors and irrigation was triggered when a prescribed ad was reached the swb based model relied on soil taw and weather data the sensor based method which used a wireless soil moisture sensor network provided measurements of the actual soil water conditions in the field the two scheduling methods showed a variation in timing and the quantity of irrigation applied to the pea crop the swb based method resulted in more water being applied the sensor based technique saved about 27 45 of the irrigation water and produced the same pea yields as the swb based model this difference can be attributed to some of the inherent limitations of a simple swb in the period following a rain event that wet the soils above field capacity the swb models predicted a faster drying rate than was actually measured with the soil moisture sensors this is because the swb model does not account for the restricted drainage that occurs in the manawatū silt loam soil profile zone 2 this restricted drainage is due to the compact nature of the silt loam subsoil as well as the impact of the textural break that occurs between the base of the subsoil and the underlying coarser gravels the estimated et c by k cb ndvi did not significantly improve the fao56 approach crop growth was not significantly different between the two scheduling treatments therefore the iwue for the pea crop was significantly more efficient for the sensor based technique compared with the swb technique for scheduling irrigation future research could be undertaken to extend the comparison of these two scheduling systems to different crops and for different climatic conditions in addition future research is required to investigate the value of including wsn monitoring systems into precision irrigation software control systems to increase

10809,to establish the optimum fertilization rate and propose an appropriate drip fertigation regime for winter wheat in the north china plain ncp a three year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of drip fertigation levels on soil available nutrients winter wheat growth grain yield partial factor productivity pfp and irrigation water use efficiency iwue during 2014 2017 the experiment investigated five fertilization rates 20 45 70 95 and 120 of the local recommended fertilizer dose 336 kg ha n and 169 kg ha p2o5 for high grain yield the results showed that with the increase of fertilization rates the concentrations of the soil available nitrogen n and phosphorus p in the 0 140 cm layer increased and especially the n in deep layer 100 140 cm and the p in surface layer 0 20 cm increased evidently by 0 64 and 0 06 mg kg with each unit increased of fertilization rate respectively compared with the initial available nutrient concentrations the fertilization rate of 45 70 could basically maintain the balance of soil available n and the fertilization rate of 70 provided a good balance for soil available p different fertilization rates had significant effects on winter wheat plant height h maximum leaf area index lai dry matter dm grain yield pfp and iwue with each unit of increase in the fertilization rate the winter wheat yield increased rapidly by 0 61 in the fertilization rate from 20 70 and slowly by 0 32 in the fertilization rate from 70 120 the pfp decreased according to a power function with the increasing fertilization rate compared to the average grain yield and pfp under the local surface irrigation regime drip fertigation of 70 of the local recommended fertilizer dose resulted in a yield increase of 4 0 and a pfp increase of 48 5 to achieve a relatively high grain yield high fertilization use efficiency and minimize risk of environment pollution a reduction in the fertilization rate to 70 of the local recommended fertilization dose 235 kg ha n and 118 kg ha p2o5 was suggested for winter wheat production under drip fertigation in the ncp keywords drip fertigation fertilization rate winter wheat grain yield partial factor productivity irrigation water use efficiency 1 introduction the north china plain ncp is one of the most important grain production regions in china the region produces approximately 76 of the nation s wheat triticum aestivum l and 30 of the nation s maize zea mays l national bureau of statistics of china 2017 the sustainable development of grain production in this region is important for national food security fertilizers are essential for grain production in this region traditional fertilization by farmers always involves a combination of a base fertilizer at sowing and a top dressing by broadcasting fertilization before irrigation at the regreening to jointing stages of winter wheat to increase the grain production there has been a tendency to adopt a high fertilizer application rate in the ncp however the fertilizer use efficiency is only 20 30 the fertilizer loss rate via ammonia nh3 volatilization denitrification and nitrate nitrogen no3 n leaching has reached 15 45 in the ncp ju et al 2009 liu et al 2003 this has already had significant impacts on the environment such as no3 n leaching to groundwater and has caused agricultural non point source pollution zhao et al 2006 there is an urgent need for high efficiency fertilization methods for winter wheat in this region drip fertigation is considered to be one of the most efficient methods of fertilizer application water and fertilizers can be uniformly applied to the root zone of plants in a timely and precise manner according to the water and nutrients requirements of plants bar yosef 1999 nakayama and bucks 1986 it can significantly improve grain yield water use efficiency fertilizer use efficiency and reduce environmental pollution eissa et al 2018 tian et al 2017 as agricultural pollution and water shortages have become increasingly serious in the ncp drip irrigation has been used to support sustainable crop production in the region wang et al 2013 compared drip and level basin irrigation on the growth and yield of winter wheat in daxing beijing for three years and the results indicated that drip irrigation provided water savings about 45 9 114 8 mm of 14 35 with a yield loss of 5 13 and water use efficiency wue was significantly improved nie et al 2013 found that in the heilonggang region drip irrigaiton resulted in 45 105 mm less irrigation water having to be applied resulting in a 57 5 86 4 mm reduction in water consumption without a significant yield loss and an increase of 6 2 16 0 in the wue when compared to surface irrigation in normal and dry years the nutrient distribution and transfer in soil under drip irrigation differs from that under conventional irrigation due to the variations in water movement distribution in the soil and fertilizer application methods gasser et al 2002 however the fertilization requirement for crops is mainly determined by its biological characteristics therefore field experiments under drip irrigation were conducted to obtain the optimal proportional coefficient of recommended fertilizer rate which can simply and efficiently determine drip fertigation scheduling this method has been used to determine drip fertigation schedules for many crops such as tomato rajan et al 2014 cotton jayakumar et al 2015 and corn ibrahim et al 2016 liu et al 2014 found that drip fertigation with 33 of the traditional fertilizer dose should be considered for tea production in the danjiangkou reservoir area of china because it reduced total nitrogen n and total phosphorus p losses to the environment and increased tea yield by 1 4 with 67 less fertilizer an experiment in the qaidam region showed that an application of 70 of the recommended fertilizer amount to local potato crops with drip fertigation would obtain a high potato yield and high water and fertilizer use efficiencies wan et al 2016 feng et al 2017 reported high yield levels of potatoes and found that both high irrigation water productivity and partial factor productivity pfp could be achieved by drip fertigation with 72 of the recommended fertilization dose which should be considered the optimum conditions for potato production on sandy soils in this study the drip fertigation schedule for winter wheat was based on proportional coefficients and the local nutrient balanced recommendation fertilizer dose the aims of this study were to 1 investigate the effect of different fertigation levels on winter wheat growth yield and the productivity of fertilizer and irrigation water under drip irrigation and 2 determine optimal drip fertigation regimes for winter wheat in the ncp 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted during the winter wheat growing seasons in 2014 2015 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 at nanpi eco agricultural experimental station chinese academy of sciences the station 38 00 n longitude 116 40 e 11 m above sea level is located in nanpi county hebei province it has a typical seasonal temperate semi humid monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 12 3 c soil at the experimental site is classified as a silt loam and a silt texture according to soil survey usda 1998 soil bulk density varies over the range of 1 40 1 66 g cm3 the soil ph was slightly alkaline in the range of 8 0 8 2 the organic matter total n and total p in the topsoil 0 20 cm were 9 7 0 4 and 0 6 g kg respectively the distribution of available n including no3 n and ammonium n nh4 n throughout the soil profile varied the average soil available n was 10 8 mg kg in the upper 20 cm which decreased gradually to around 5 1 mg kg as soil depths increased to 70 80 cm and increased to about 23 9 mg kg at 100 140 cm the available p decreased as soil depths increased but was mainly distributed in the upper 20 cm where the concentration was 6 6 mg kg the higher soil available n concentration in the 100 140 cm layer was probably due to the relatively high groundwater levels and nutrient rich groundwater in this area generally soil nutrient concentrations such as organic matter total n available n and available p were low prior to winter wheat cultivation the basic physical properties and soil nutrients in the initial soil profile are shown in tables 1 and 2 2 2 experimental design the experimental treatments consisted of five fertilization rates 20 df1 45 df2 70 df3 95 df4 and 120 df5 of the local recommendation fertilizer dose 336 kg ha n and 169 kg ha p2o5 for high grain yield zhao et al 2006 the amount of fertilization applied in each treatment during the winter wheat growing periods in 2014 2017 is detailed in table 3 in this study loss controlled diammonium phosphate 16 n 45 p2o5 and urea 46 n were applied as a basal fertilizer the loss controlled fertilizer was developed by the key laboratory of ion beam bioengineering chinese academy of sciences and produced by adding a natural nano material attapulgite to traditional fertilizer attapulgites can form a micro nano network through self assembly on contact with water in soil the nutrients can be effectively combined and held in the networks and then retained around crop roots thus reducing nutrient loss cai et al 2014 urea was added to fertilizer tanks and applied with fertigation as a topdressing fertilizer from the reviving stage to the end of the grain filling stage drip fertigation occurred over a total of 60 days each year the amount of urea supplied for each irrigation event depended on the irrigation interval the experiment had a completely randomized block design with three replicates for each of the five treatments each plot was 10 m long by 5 4 m wide each treatment was equipped with an independent drip irrigation system the irrigation system consisted of valves two pressure gauges a water flow meter a screen filter a fertilizer tank and 27 drip laterals nine drip laterals per plot the distance between drip laterals was 60 cm with four rows of winter wheat fig 1 the drip laterals had 20 cm emitter spacing and a discharge rate of 1 38 l m h with an operating pressure of 0 1 mpa 2 3 crop management the winter wheat variety for the three growing seasons was xiaoyan81 winter wheat seeds were sown at a density of 225 kg ha with a row spacing of 15 cm each year the winter wheat was sown between october 10 and 12 and harvested between june 6 and 9 in addition weeds disease and insect control were uniformly managed during the winter wheat growing seasons 2 4 irrigation management as soon as winter wheat was sowed the first irrigation water of 25 and 32 mm was applied to all plots to ensure uniform germination in 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 respectively prior to the winter freeze 32 mm of irrigation water was applied to all plots to ensure safe overwintering in 2014 2015 and no irrigation water was applied in 2016 2017 because of the good soil moisture in 2015 2016 the first irrigation was applied at the reviving stage and no irrigation was applied to seedlings or before freezing because the soil moisture was adequate according to the biological characteristics of winter wheat wang 1995 the reviving to grain filling stage is the key period of water demand for grains such as wheat a soil matric potential smp threshold of 40 kpa was recommend to achieve a high dry matter dm and grain yield shao et al 1996 taylor and ashcroft 1972 in this study during the reviving to the end of grain filling stage irrigation based on the smp threshold of 40 kpa was applied approximately 8 mm of water was applied per irrigation event and one or two additional 8 mm irrigation events were applied if the smp value was still lower than 10 kpa after irrigation the irrigation ended only when the smp value was higher than 10 kpa in three growing seasons the last irrigation was applied about 20 days before harvest 2 5 observation and measurements 2 5 1 soil sampling and analysis before plowing soil samples from depths of 0 140 cm were obtained from soil cores extracted from each plot with an auger to determine the soil nutrient concentrations including organic matter total n total p available n available p and available potassium k as shown in table 2 soil samples were collected at harvest time in 2015 2016 and 2017 for the analysis of soil available n and available p concentrations the soil nutrient balance was calculated as the soil nutrient concentration in the final season 2016 2017 minus the initial concentration the distances to the drip laterals for sampling were 0 7 5 15 22 5 and 30 cm and samples were taken from the 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 100 120 and 120 140 cm layers the layout of the drip laterals and position of the tensiometer and soil samples are shown in fig 1 2 5 2 plant growth indicators and grain yield for each plot ten representative plants were randomly selected and plant height h leaf area index lai and dm were determined at 10 day intervals during the winter wheat growing season leaf length and width were measured using a ruler and leaf area was calculated by multiplying the length and width with a coefficient of 0 8 the lai was calculated as the total leaf area of the plant divided by the ground area covered by the plant grain yield was determined from three 1 1 m quadrats in the middle of each plot twenty five other representative plants in the middle rows of each plot were randomly selected and harvested for yield component analysis 2 5 3 partial factor productivity partial factor productivity kg kg was defined as the total grain yield per unit land area y kg ha divided by the total amount f kg ha of n p2o5 cassman et al 1996 yadav et al 2000 1 p f p y f 2 5 4 irrigation wue iwue iwue kg m3 can be calculated in units of wheat grain yield per unit land area y kg ha divided by the amount of irrigation water consumed by wheat per unit land area i mm to produce that yield howell et al 1990 2 i w u e y i where y is the wheat grain yield kg ha and i is the irrigation water applied mm to determine the influences of different fertilization rates on winter wheat h the maximum lai and maximum dm grain yield and pfp in different years the relative importance of these indicators was calculated as the ratio expressed as a percentage of these indicators for the df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments to those of the df1 treatment 2 6 statistical analysis a standard analysis of variance anova was performed using spss 18 0 spss inc chicago il usa duncan s multiple range tests were used to compare and rank the treatment means differences were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation and irrigation the total precipitation during the winter wheat growing seasons was 105 0 108 6 and 71 2 mm in 2014 2015 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively fig 2 in 2014 2015 there was almost no precipitation from the seeding to reviving stages and irrigation amounts of 25 and 32 mm were applied after winter wheat sowing and before freezing from the regreening to jointing jointing to anthesis and anthesis to harvest stages the precipitation was 33 4 31 2 and 38 8 mm respectively during this period the wheat was irrigated 3 5 times and the irrigation amounts were 88 104 mm there was an increasing tendency in the irrigation amounts and numbers with the increase of fertilization rate except the df3 treatment in 2015 2016 69 6 the precipitation fell between the seeding recovering stages and there was no irrigation applied during this period from the regreening to harvest stages the wheat was irrigated 6 7 times and the irrigation amounts were 120 136 mm the total irrigation amounts and numbers were basically the same for different fertilization rate treatments except the df4 treatment in 2016 2017 there was no precipitation before sowing and 53 5 of the precipitation fell between the seeding recovering stages and so an irrigation amount of 32 mm was applied to all plots to ensure uniform germination from regreening to harvest stages the wheat was irrigated 5 6 times and the irrigation amounts were 128 144 mm there was a tendency for the irrigation amounts and numbers to increase with the increase of fertilization rate as a whole the average irrigation amount and number in 2014 2017 was 147 158 152 152 and 158 mm and 6 6 6 6 and 7 times for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively table 4 there was only a slight increasing tendency in the irrigation amounts and numbers with the increase of fertilization rates this was mainly because the smp threshold which scheduled irrigation was the same 40 kpa for all treatments 3 2 soil available nutrients 3 2 1 soil available n soil available n i e n available for plant uptake is highly soluble and easily transported ayars et al 2017 found that over time with crop planting there was a gradual accumulation of available n throughout the whole soil profile in order to study the soil nutrient balance accumulation or consumption the soil available nutrient concentrations were analyzed at harvest time in the final winter wheat growing season 2016 2017 as shown in fig 3 there was a significant positive linear correlation between fertilization rate and the average soil available n concentration throughout the 0 140 cm layer p 0 01 the average available n concentration in the 0 140 cm layer increased rapidly by 0 37 mg kg with each unit of increase in the fertilization rate the average soil available n in the 0 140 cm layer was 6 2 16 9 24 2 34 0 and 43 9 mg kg for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively this result was consistent with those of previous studies bergstrom and brink 1986 cui et al 2006 huang et al 2018 these studies also found that the soil n concentration at harvest time was positively correlated with the fertilizer application rate it is known that the soil available n was mainly distributed in the 0 40 cm layer under drip fertigation chen et al 2015 and the soil available n below a depth of 100 cm presented a leaching risk so the relationship between fertilization rates and the average soil available n concentration in the 0 40 40 100 and 100 140 cm layers was further analyzed fig 4 in the 0 40 cm soil profile there were a significant positive linear correlation between fertilization rates in the range of 20 70 and the average soil available n concentrations p 0 05 the average available n concentrations increased rapidly by 0 35 mg kg with each unit of increase in the fertilization rate from 20 70 and tended to be stable when the fertilization rate ranged from 70 120 there was also significant positive linear correlations between the fertilization rate and the average soil available n concentration in the 40 100 and 100 140 layers p 0 01 the average available n concentration in the 40 100 and 100 140 cm layers increased rapidly by 0 31 and 0 64 mg kg respectively with each unit of increase in the fertilization rate the slope of the soil available n concentration reached a maximum below 100 cm the average available n concentration in the 100 140 cm layer was 5 8 18 2 31 2 48 1 and 70 5 mg kg for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively this indicated that as more fertilizer was applied there was a tendency for soil n to leach to the deep layer below 100 cm which may generate agricultural non point source pollution a similar tendency was also observed in previous studies davis et al 2003 jayasundara et al 2007 ma et al 2019 also found that with an increase in the fertilization rate soil available n moved downward and accumulated in deep soil layers and the n leaching loss increased significantly compared with the initial available n concentrations table 2 the accumulation or consumption of the soil available n in the 0 40 40 100 and 100 140 cm layers were analyzed table 5 in the 0 40 cm soil profile the soil available n concentration increased for all treatments in the 40 100 cm layers the soil available n concentration for df1 reduced by 1 7 mg kg that is decreased by 28 while the values for the other four treatments increased with the increase of fertilization rates in the 100 140 cm layers the soil available n concentration for the df1 and df2 treatments reduced by 18 1 mg kg and 5 7 mg kg that is by 76 and 24 respectively and the values for the other three treatments increased with the increase of fertilization rates it can be known that the lowest fertilization rate of 20 leads to the depletion of soil available n when the fertilization rate increased to 95 or higher the available n increased significantly especially below 100 cm this could be because the amount of n fertilizer exceeded the demand of winter wheat more available n were remained in soil layer for the fertilization rate of 45 the available n in the 100 140 cm layer was slightly consumed while for the fertilization rate of 70 it was slightly increased so the fertilization rate of 45 70 could basically maintain the balance of soil available n 3 2 2 soil available p the average available p concentration in the 0 140 cm layer increased rapidly by 0 02 mg kg with each unit of increase in the fertilization rate fig 5 these results were consistent with those observed in other studies sheng et al 2004 zhao et al 2014 the average soil available p concentration in the 0 140 cm layer was 2 1 2 1 2 5 2 9 and 4 0 mg kg for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively due to soil p being easily adsorbed and fixed it accumulated mainly in the surface 0 20 cm layer klein et al 1999 and many studies have also confirmed that the soil available p was mainly distributed in the 0 20 cm layer under drip irrigation kafkafi and baryosef 1980 wang and wang 2007 so the relationships between fertilization rates and the average soil available p concentration in the 0 20 and 20 140 cm layers were further analyzed as shown in fig 6 the available p concentration in the 0 20 and 20 140 cm layers increased rapidly by 0 06 and 0 01 mg kg respectively with each unit of increase in the fertilization rate and significant correlations were observed at 0 20 cm p 0 01 and 20 140 cm p 0 05 the increase in soil available p was greater in the topsoil 0 20 cm than in the deeper soil layers 20 140 cm the average available p concentration in the 0 20 cm layer were 4 6 5 2 6 8 7 6 and 10 6 mg kg for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively these results suggested that as more fertilizer was applied more available p would accumulate in the upper layer 0 20 cm after three winter wheat growing seasons this agreed with previous studies that showed the application of fertilizer for many years would improve the soil available p concentration turtola and yli halla 1999 yang et al 2004 which was mainly manifested as an increase in the available p concentration in the 0 20 cm soil layer otto and kilian 2001 compared with the initial available p concentration table 2 the accumulation or consumption of the soil available p in the 0 20 and 20 140 cm layers were analyzed table 5 the soil available p concentrations for the df1 and df2 treatments decreased by 1 9 and 1 3 mg kg that is 30 and 20 respectively in the 0 20 cm and decreased by 0 1 and 0 1 mg kg that is 4 and 8 respectively in 20 140 cm soil profile the soil available p for df3 increased slightly by 0 2 mg kg 3 in 0 20 cm and 0 03 mg kg 2 in the 20 140 cm layers the corresponding values in the 0 20 and 20 140 cm layers for the df4 and df5 treatments increased by 0 3 4 0 mg kg that is 16 62 respectively it can be known that the fertilization rate of 20 45 led the soil available p depletion the fertilization rate of 95 120 caused the soil available p accumulation and the fertilization rate of 70 got a good balance for soil available p 3 3 winter wheat growth indicators the plant growth indicators including the largest h the maximum lai and the maximum aboveground dm are presented in fig 7 and the relationships between them and fertilization rates in 2014 2017 are shown in fig 8 the largest h for the df1 treatment was significantly lower than that for the df5 treatment in 2014 2015 in 2016 2017 the df1 h was significantly lower than the values for the other four treatments the average largest h in the three growing seasons were 67 1 71 2 70 6 71 8 and 71 8 cm for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively fig 7a the maximum dm for the df1 treatment was significantly lower than the values for the other four treatments in 2014 2015 in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 the maximum dm values for the df1 and df2 treatments were significantly lower than the values for the other three treatments the average dm was 2 42 2 63 2 83 2 82 and 2 99 g plant for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively fig 7b the maximum lai was significantly affected by the fertilization rate during the three years the maximum lai values for the df1 and df2 treatments were significantly lower than the values for the other three treatments the most significant differences among the five treatments were observed in 2016 2017 the average maximum lai values in the three winter wheat growing seasons were 3 97 4 64 5 48 5 83 and 6 37 m2 m2 for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively fig 7c as fig 8 shows there were significant positive linear correlations between the fertilization rate and the relative h p 0 05 as well as the lai and dm p 0 01 the maximum slope was obtained for the lai while the minimum was obtained for h similarly zhang et al 2013 and li et al 2016 also found that the lai and dm increased with an increase in the fertilization rate compared with df1 the maximum dm for the df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments increased by 8 6 16 7 14 9 and 23 5 respectively while the lai increased by 16 7 37 8 40 0 and 60 4 respectively 3 4 grain yield and yield components grain yield in winter wheat was significantly affected by the fertilizer application rate table 6 the grain yields for the df4 and df5 treatments were significantly higher than those for the df1 and df2 treatments in all three seasons but were not significantly higher than that for the df3 treatment considering the yield components the smp had significant effects on the spike number per hectare in all three years the spike numbers for the df4 and df5 treatments were significantly higher than those for the df1 and df2 treatments in all three seasons but were not significantly higher than that for the df3 treatment when the fertilization rate was increased from 20 to 120 the spike number per hectare in the df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments in comparison with df1 increased by 8 7 18 5 25 6 and 30 5 respectively no significant differences in the kernels per spike were observed among the five treatments expect for the lower spike numbers recorded in the df1 treatment during 2016 2017 the 1000 kernel weight was not significantly affected by the different smps in 2015 2017 these findings were very similar to those obtained by karam et al 2009 who demonstrated that the spike number per hectare was significantly influenced by fertilization rates and fertilization rates were observed not to have a significant effect on the 1000 grain weight this suggested that fertilization rates had a significant effect on the spike number per hectare and then the resulting yield differences the relationship between relative grain yield and fertilization rates in 2014 2017 is shown in fig 9 a regression analysis showed that there was a positive linear increase in yield with increasing fertigation rate among the fertigation treatments the yields increased rapidly by 0 61 with each unit of increase in the fertilization rate when the application rate was 20 70 p 0 01 at fertilization rates above 70 the increase in relative yield slowed by 0 32 with each unit of increase in the fertilization rate p 0 05 the results were similar to those reported by behera and panda 2009 who found that the grain yield increased with fertilization rate for wheat crops the mean grain yield in the three winter wheat growing seasons was 5017 1 5698 3 6549 4 6967 9 and 7337 7 kg ha for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively when compared to the local average winter wheat grain yield 6300 kg ha under a fertilization rate of 100 and surface irrigation in the experimental site the grain yield for the df1 and df2 treatments decreased by 20 4 and 9 6 while those for the df3 df4 and df5 treatments increased by 4 0 10 6 and 16 5 respectively 3 5 partial factor productivity and iwue partial factor productivity is a useful measure of fertilizer use efficiency and provides an integrative indicator of the soil nutrient levels and applied fertilization cassman et al 1998 the pfp for all treatments during 2014 2017 are detailed in table 6 in the three winter wheat growing seasons the pfp for the df1 treatment was significantly higher than the values for the other four treatments while the pfp for the df4 and df5 treatments was significantly lower than for the other three treatments the regression analysis showed that there was a negative power function relationship between the relative pfp and fertilization application rate p 0 01 the relative pfp decreased rapidly at fertilization rates of 20 70 and then more slowly at a fertilization rate of 70 fig 10 fang et al 2006 reported a similar tendency for winter wheat in the ncp the pfp in the three winter wheat growing seasons averaged 49 7 25 1 18 5 14 5 and 12 1 kg kg for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively compared to the local average pfp 12 5 kg kg under a fertilization rate of 100 at the experimental site the pfp increased by 298 2 101 0 48 5 and 16 4 in the df1 df2 df3 and df4 treatments respectively while that in the df5 treatment decreased by 2 9 the fertilization rates also had significant effects on iwue in 2014 2017 table 6 the iwue for the df3 df4 and df5 treatments was significantly higher than that for the df1 and df2 treatments this difference was mainly due to the difference in yield the average iwue in the three winter wheat growing seasons was 3 43 3 65 4 38 4 73 and 4 74 kg m3 for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively a better drip fertigation scheduling could improve grain yield and fertilization efficiency and reduce the risk of environmental pollution as shown in this study soil available n and p at the harvest stage the largest h the maximum lai the maximum dm grain yield and pfp were all significantly correlated with the fertilization rate clearly a high fertilization rate did result in higher wheat growth indicators and grain yield but also significantly increased the available n and p accumulation in the soil profile compared with the initial available nutrient concentrations the fertilization rate of 45 70 got a relatively good balance of soil available n and the fertilization rate of 70 provided a good balance for soil available p at a fertilization rate of 70 grain yields reached 5912 2 6905 3 kg ha with an average of 6549 4 kg ha in all three growing seasons during 2014 2017 this was higher than the yields of the df1 and df2 treatments however no significant differences was found among the df3 df4 and df5 treatments p 0 05 compared to grain yield 6300 kg ha with a fertilization rate of 100 under surface irrigation the grain yield increased by 4 0 with the fertilization rate of 70 and decreased by 9 6 with the fertilization rate of 45 for farmers the primary concern is high yield not the water resources or environment therefore drip fertigation with 70 of the local recommended fertilization rate could be suggested to obtain both high grain yield and satisfactory environmental benefits 4 conclusions under drip irrigation based on the smp threshold of 40 kpa different fertilization rates had a significant effect on the soil available nutrient concentrations as more fertilizer was applied the soil available n and p concentrations in the 0 140 cm layers increased and more available n tended to leach to the deep layers of 100 140 cm and more available p inclined to accumulate in the upper layer of 0 20 cm compared with the initial soil nutrient the fertilization rate of 45 70 was enough to maintain the balance of soil available n and the fertilization rate of 70 could keep the balance of soil available p different fertilization levels had significant effects on winter wheat growth indicators and grain yield with the increase of fertilization rates the relative plant height maximum leaf area index and dry matter linearly increased the winter wheat yield increased rapidly when the fertilization rate was between 20 and 70 and increased slowly when it was higher than 70 the pfp decreased in a power function with an increase in the fertilization rate compared with the average grain yield 6300 kg ha and pfp 12 5 kg kg under surface irrigation with local recommended fertilizer dose the yield decreased by 9 6 and the pfp increased by 101 0 at fertilization rate of 45 and at fertilization rate of 70 the yield and pfp increased by 4 0 and 48 5 respectively considering the relative high grain yield high fertilizer use efficiency and minimum accumulation of n and p in soil it is suggested to drip fertigation levels of 70 of the local recommended dose 235 kg ha n and 118 kg ha p2o5 for winter wheat production in the ncp declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest acknowledgements this study was supported by the

10809,to establish the optimum fertilization rate and propose an appropriate drip fertigation regime for winter wheat in the north china plain ncp a three year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of drip fertigation levels on soil available nutrients winter wheat growth grain yield partial factor productivity pfp and irrigation water use efficiency iwue during 2014 2017 the experiment investigated five fertilization rates 20 45 70 95 and 120 of the local recommended fertilizer dose 336 kg ha n and 169 kg ha p2o5 for high grain yield the results showed that with the increase of fertilization rates the concentrations of the soil available nitrogen n and phosphorus p in the 0 140 cm layer increased and especially the n in deep layer 100 140 cm and the p in surface layer 0 20 cm increased evidently by 0 64 and 0 06 mg kg with each unit increased of fertilization rate respectively compared with the initial available nutrient concentrations the fertilization rate of 45 70 could basically maintain the balance of soil available n and the fertilization rate of 70 provided a good balance for soil available p different fertilization rates had significant effects on winter wheat plant height h maximum leaf area index lai dry matter dm grain yield pfp and iwue with each unit of increase in the fertilization rate the winter wheat yield increased rapidly by 0 61 in the fertilization rate from 20 70 and slowly by 0 32 in the fertilization rate from 70 120 the pfp decreased according to a power function with the increasing fertilization rate compared to the average grain yield and pfp under the local surface irrigation regime drip fertigation of 70 of the local recommended fertilizer dose resulted in a yield increase of 4 0 and a pfp increase of 48 5 to achieve a relatively high grain yield high fertilization use efficiency and minimize risk of environment pollution a reduction in the fertilization rate to 70 of the local recommended fertilization dose 235 kg ha n and 118 kg ha p2o5 was suggested for winter wheat production under drip fertigation in the ncp keywords drip fertigation fertilization rate winter wheat grain yield partial factor productivity irrigation water use efficiency 1 introduction the north china plain ncp is one of the most important grain production regions in china the region produces approximately 76 of the nation s wheat triticum aestivum l and 30 of the nation s maize zea mays l national bureau of statistics of china 2017 the sustainable development of grain production in this region is important for national food security fertilizers are essential for grain production in this region traditional fertilization by farmers always involves a combination of a base fertilizer at sowing and a top dressing by broadcasting fertilization before irrigation at the regreening to jointing stages of winter wheat to increase the grain production there has been a tendency to adopt a high fertilizer application rate in the ncp however the fertilizer use efficiency is only 20 30 the fertilizer loss rate via ammonia nh3 volatilization denitrification and nitrate nitrogen no3 n leaching has reached 15 45 in the ncp ju et al 2009 liu et al 2003 this has already had significant impacts on the environment such as no3 n leaching to groundwater and has caused agricultural non point source pollution zhao et al 2006 there is an urgent need for high efficiency fertilization methods for winter wheat in this region drip fertigation is considered to be one of the most efficient methods of fertilizer application water and fertilizers can be uniformly applied to the root zone of plants in a timely and precise manner according to the water and nutrients requirements of plants bar yosef 1999 nakayama and bucks 1986 it can significantly improve grain yield water use efficiency fertilizer use efficiency and reduce environmental pollution eissa et al 2018 tian et al 2017 as agricultural pollution and water shortages have become increasingly serious in the ncp drip irrigation has been used to support sustainable crop production in the region wang et al 2013 compared drip and level basin irrigation on the growth and yield of winter wheat in daxing beijing for three years and the results indicated that drip irrigation provided water savings about 45 9 114 8 mm of 14 35 with a yield loss of 5 13 and water use efficiency wue was significantly improved nie et al 2013 found that in the heilonggang region drip irrigaiton resulted in 45 105 mm less irrigation water having to be applied resulting in a 57 5 86 4 mm reduction in water consumption without a significant yield loss and an increase of 6 2 16 0 in the wue when compared to surface irrigation in normal and dry years the nutrient distribution and transfer in soil under drip irrigation differs from that under conventional irrigation due to the variations in water movement distribution in the soil and fertilizer application methods gasser et al 2002 however the fertilization requirement for crops is mainly determined by its biological characteristics therefore field experiments under drip irrigation were conducted to obtain the optimal proportional coefficient of recommended fertilizer rate which can simply and efficiently determine drip fertigation scheduling this method has been used to determine drip fertigation schedules for many crops such as tomato rajan et al 2014 cotton jayakumar et al 2015 and corn ibrahim et al 2016 liu et al 2014 found that drip fertigation with 33 of the traditional fertilizer dose should be considered for tea production in the danjiangkou reservoir area of china because it reduced total nitrogen n and total phosphorus p losses to the environment and increased tea yield by 1 4 with 67 less fertilizer an experiment in the qaidam region showed that an application of 70 of the recommended fertilizer amount to local potato crops with drip fertigation would obtain a high potato yield and high water and fertilizer use efficiencies wan et al 2016 feng et al 2017 reported high yield levels of potatoes and found that both high irrigation water productivity and partial factor productivity pfp could be achieved by drip fertigation with 72 of the recommended fertilization dose which should be considered the optimum conditions for potato production on sandy soils in this study the drip fertigation schedule for winter wheat was based on proportional coefficients and the local nutrient balanced recommendation fertilizer dose the aims of this study were to 1 investigate the effect of different fertigation levels on winter wheat growth yield and the productivity of fertilizer and irrigation water under drip irrigation and 2 determine optimal drip fertigation regimes for winter wheat in the ncp 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted during the winter wheat growing seasons in 2014 2015 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 at nanpi eco agricultural experimental station chinese academy of sciences the station 38 00 n longitude 116 40 e 11 m above sea level is located in nanpi county hebei province it has a typical seasonal temperate semi humid monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 12 3 c soil at the experimental site is classified as a silt loam and a silt texture according to soil survey usda 1998 soil bulk density varies over the range of 1 40 1 66 g cm3 the soil ph was slightly alkaline in the range of 8 0 8 2 the organic matter total n and total p in the topsoil 0 20 cm were 9 7 0 4 and 0 6 g kg respectively the distribution of available n including no3 n and ammonium n nh4 n throughout the soil profile varied the average soil available n was 10 8 mg kg in the upper 20 cm which decreased gradually to around 5 1 mg kg as soil depths increased to 70 80 cm and increased to about 23 9 mg kg at 100 140 cm the available p decreased as soil depths increased but was mainly distributed in the upper 20 cm where the concentration was 6 6 mg kg the higher soil available n concentration in the 100 140 cm layer was probably due to the relatively high groundwater levels and nutrient rich groundwater in this area generally soil nutrient concentrations such as organic matter total n available n and available p were low prior to winter wheat cultivation the basic physical properties and soil nutrients in the initial soil profile are shown in tables 1 and 2 2 2 experimental design the experimental treatments consisted of five fertilization rates 20 df1 45 df2 70 df3 95 df4 and 120 df5 of the local recommendation fertilizer dose 336 kg ha n and 169 kg ha p2o5 for high grain yield zhao et al 2006 the amount of fertilization applied in each treatment during the winter wheat growing periods in 2014 2017 is detailed in table 3 in this study loss controlled diammonium phosphate 16 n 45 p2o5 and urea 46 n were applied as a basal fertilizer the loss controlled fertilizer was developed by the key laboratory of ion beam bioengineering chinese academy of sciences and produced by adding a natural nano material attapulgite to traditional fertilizer attapulgites can form a micro nano network through self assembly on contact with water in soil the nutrients can be effectively combined and held in the networks and then retained around crop roots thus reducing nutrient loss cai et al 2014 urea was added to fertilizer tanks and applied with fertigation as a topdressing fertilizer from the reviving stage to the end of the grain filling stage drip fertigation occurred over a total of 60 days each year the amount of urea supplied for each irrigation event depended on the irrigation interval the experiment had a completely randomized block design with three replicates for each of the five treatments each plot was 10 m long by 5 4 m wide each treatment was equipped with an independent drip irrigation system the irrigation system consisted of valves two pressure gauges a water flow meter a screen filter a fertilizer tank and 27 drip laterals nine drip laterals per plot the distance between drip laterals was 60 cm with four rows of winter wheat fig 1 the drip laterals had 20 cm emitter spacing and a discharge rate of 1 38 l m h with an operating pressure of 0 1 mpa 2 3 crop management the winter wheat variety for the three growing seasons was xiaoyan81 winter wheat seeds were sown at a density of 225 kg ha with a row spacing of 15 cm each year the winter wheat was sown between october 10 and 12 and harvested between june 6 and 9 in addition weeds disease and insect control were uniformly managed during the winter wheat growing seasons 2 4 irrigation management as soon as winter wheat was sowed the first irrigation water of 25 and 32 mm was applied to all plots to ensure uniform germination in 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 respectively prior to the winter freeze 32 mm of irrigation water was applied to all plots to ensure safe overwintering in 2014 2015 and no irrigation water was applied in 2016 2017 because of the good soil moisture in 2015 2016 the first irrigation was applied at the reviving stage and no irrigation was applied to seedlings or before freezing because the soil moisture was adequate according to the biological characteristics of winter wheat wang 1995 the reviving to grain filling stage is the key period of water demand for grains such as wheat a soil matric potential smp threshold of 40 kpa was recommend to achieve a high dry matter dm and grain yield shao et al 1996 taylor and ashcroft 1972 in this study during the reviving to the end of grain filling stage irrigation based on the smp threshold of 40 kpa was applied approximately 8 mm of water was applied per irrigation event and one or two additional 8 mm irrigation events were applied if the smp value was still lower than 10 kpa after irrigation the irrigation ended only when the smp value was higher than 10 kpa in three growing seasons the last irrigation was applied about 20 days before harvest 2 5 observation and measurements 2 5 1 soil sampling and analysis before plowing soil samples from depths of 0 140 cm were obtained from soil cores extracted from each plot with an auger to determine the soil nutrient concentrations including organic matter total n total p available n available p and available potassium k as shown in table 2 soil samples were collected at harvest time in 2015 2016 and 2017 for the analysis of soil available n and available p concentrations the soil nutrient balance was calculated as the soil nutrient concentration in the final season 2016 2017 minus the initial concentration the distances to the drip laterals for sampling were 0 7 5 15 22 5 and 30 cm and samples were taken from the 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 100 120 and 120 140 cm layers the layout of the drip laterals and position of the tensiometer and soil samples are shown in fig 1 2 5 2 plant growth indicators and grain yield for each plot ten representative plants were randomly selected and plant height h leaf area index lai and dm were determined at 10 day intervals during the winter wheat growing season leaf length and width were measured using a ruler and leaf area was calculated by multiplying the length and width with a coefficient of 0 8 the lai was calculated as the total leaf area of the plant divided by the ground area covered by the plant grain yield was determined from three 1 1 m quadrats in the middle of each plot twenty five other representative plants in the middle rows of each plot were randomly selected and harvested for yield component analysis 2 5 3 partial factor productivity partial factor productivity kg kg was defined as the total grain yield per unit land area y kg ha divided by the total amount f kg ha of n p2o5 cassman et al 1996 yadav et al 2000 1 p f p y f 2 5 4 irrigation wue iwue iwue kg m3 can be calculated in units of wheat grain yield per unit land area y kg ha divided by the amount of irrigation water consumed by wheat per unit land area i mm to produce that yield howell et al 1990 2 i w u e y i where y is the wheat grain yield kg ha and i is the irrigation water applied mm to determine the influences of different fertilization rates on winter wheat h the maximum lai and maximum dm grain yield and pfp in different years the relative importance of these indicators was calculated as the ratio expressed as a percentage of these indicators for the df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments to those of the df1 treatment 2 6 statistical analysis a standard analysis of variance anova was performed using spss 18 0 spss inc chicago il usa duncan s multiple range tests were used to compare and rank the treatment means differences were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation and irrigation the total precipitation during the winter wheat growing seasons was 105 0 108 6 and 71 2 mm in 2014 2015 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively fig 2 in 2014 2015 there was almost no precipitation from the seeding to reviving stages and irrigation amounts of 25 and 32 mm were applied after winter wheat sowing and before freezing from the regreening to jointing jointing to anthesis and anthesis to harvest stages the precipitation was 33 4 31 2 and 38 8 mm respectively during this period the wheat was irrigated 3 5 times and the irrigation amounts were 88 104 mm there was an increasing tendency in the irrigation amounts and numbers with the increase of fertilization rate except the df3 treatment in 2015 2016 69 6 the precipitation fell between the seeding recovering stages and there was no irrigation applied during this period from the regreening to harvest stages the wheat was irrigated 6 7 times and the irrigation amounts were 120 136 mm the total irrigation amounts and numbers were basically the same for different fertilization rate treatments except the df4 treatment in 2016 2017 there was no precipitation before sowing and 53 5 of the precipitation fell between the seeding recovering stages and so an irrigation amount of 32 mm was applied to all plots to ensure uniform germination from regreening to harvest stages the wheat was irrigated 5 6 times and the irrigation amounts were 128 144 mm there was a tendency for the irrigation amounts and numbers to increase with the increase of fertilization rate as a whole the average irrigation amount and number in 2014 2017 was 147 158 152 152 and 158 mm and 6 6 6 6 and 7 times for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively table 4 there was only a slight increasing tendency in the irrigation amounts and numbers with the increase of fertilization rates this was mainly because the smp threshold which scheduled irrigation was the same 40 kpa for all treatments 3 2 soil available nutrients 3 2 1 soil available n soil available n i e n available for plant uptake is highly soluble and easily transported ayars et al 2017 found that over time with crop planting there was a gradual accumulation of available n throughout the whole soil profile in order to study the soil nutrient balance accumulation or consumption the soil available nutrient concentrations were analyzed at harvest time in the final winter wheat growing season 2016 2017 as shown in fig 3 there was a significant positive linear correlation between fertilization rate and the average soil available n concentration throughout the 0 140 cm layer p 0 01 the average available n concentration in the 0 140 cm layer increased rapidly by 0 37 mg kg with each unit of increase in the fertilization rate the average soil available n in the 0 140 cm layer was 6 2 16 9 24 2 34 0 and 43 9 mg kg for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively this result was consistent with those of previous studies bergstrom and brink 1986 cui et al 2006 huang et al 2018 these studies also found that the soil n concentration at harvest time was positively correlated with the fertilizer application rate it is known that the soil available n was mainly distributed in the 0 40 cm layer under drip fertigation chen et al 2015 and the soil available n below a depth of 100 cm presented a leaching risk so the relationship between fertilization rates and the average soil available n concentration in the 0 40 40 100 and 100 140 cm layers was further analyzed fig 4 in the 0 40 cm soil profile there were a significant positive linear correlation between fertilization rates in the range of 20 70 and the average soil available n concentrations p 0 05 the average available n concentrations increased rapidly by 0 35 mg kg with each unit of increase in the fertilization rate from 20 70 and tended to be stable when the fertilization rate ranged from 70 120 there was also significant positive linear correlations between the fertilization rate and the average soil available n concentration in the 40 100 and 100 140 layers p 0 01 the average available n concentration in the 40 100 and 100 140 cm layers increased rapidly by 0 31 and 0 64 mg kg respectively with each unit of increase in the fertilization rate the slope of the soil available n concentration reached a maximum below 100 cm the average available n concentration in the 100 140 cm layer was 5 8 18 2 31 2 48 1 and 70 5 mg kg for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively this indicated that as more fertilizer was applied there was a tendency for soil n to leach to the deep layer below 100 cm which may generate agricultural non point source pollution a similar tendency was also observed in previous studies davis et al 2003 jayasundara et al 2007 ma et al 2019 also found that with an increase in the fertilization rate soil available n moved downward and accumulated in deep soil layers and the n leaching loss increased significantly compared with the initial available n concentrations table 2 the accumulation or consumption of the soil available n in the 0 40 40 100 and 100 140 cm layers were analyzed table 5 in the 0 40 cm soil profile the soil available n concentration increased for all treatments in the 40 100 cm layers the soil available n concentration for df1 reduced by 1 7 mg kg that is decreased by 28 while the values for the other four treatments increased with the increase of fertilization rates in the 100 140 cm layers the soil available n concentration for the df1 and df2 treatments reduced by 18 1 mg kg and 5 7 mg kg that is by 76 and 24 respectively and the values for the other three treatments increased with the increase of fertilization rates it can be known that the lowest fertilization rate of 20 leads to the depletion of soil available n when the fertilization rate increased to 95 or higher the available n increased significantly especially below 100 cm this could be because the amount of n fertilizer exceeded the demand of winter wheat more available n were remained in soil layer for the fertilization rate of 45 the available n in the 100 140 cm layer was slightly consumed while for the fertilization rate of 70 it was slightly increased so the fertilization rate of 45 70 could basically maintain the balance of soil available n 3 2 2 soil available p the average available p concentration in the 0 140 cm layer increased rapidly by 0 02 mg kg with each unit of increase in the fertilization rate fig 5 these results were consistent with those observed in other studies sheng et al 2004 zhao et al 2014 the average soil available p concentration in the 0 140 cm layer was 2 1 2 1 2 5 2 9 and 4 0 mg kg for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively due to soil p being easily adsorbed and fixed it accumulated mainly in the surface 0 20 cm layer klein et al 1999 and many studies have also confirmed that the soil available p was mainly distributed in the 0 20 cm layer under drip irrigation kafkafi and baryosef 1980 wang and wang 2007 so the relationships between fertilization rates and the average soil available p concentration in the 0 20 and 20 140 cm layers were further analyzed as shown in fig 6 the available p concentration in the 0 20 and 20 140 cm layers increased rapidly by 0 06 and 0 01 mg kg respectively with each unit of increase in the fertilization rate and significant correlations were observed at 0 20 cm p 0 01 and 20 140 cm p 0 05 the increase in soil available p was greater in the topsoil 0 20 cm than in the deeper soil layers 20 140 cm the average available p concentration in the 0 20 cm layer were 4 6 5 2 6 8 7 6 and 10 6 mg kg for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively these results suggested that as more fertilizer was applied more available p would accumulate in the upper layer 0 20 cm after three winter wheat growing seasons this agreed with previous studies that showed the application of fertilizer for many years would improve the soil available p concentration turtola and yli halla 1999 yang et al 2004 which was mainly manifested as an increase in the available p concentration in the 0 20 cm soil layer otto and kilian 2001 compared with the initial available p concentration table 2 the accumulation or consumption of the soil available p in the 0 20 and 20 140 cm layers were analyzed table 5 the soil available p concentrations for the df1 and df2 treatments decreased by 1 9 and 1 3 mg kg that is 30 and 20 respectively in the 0 20 cm and decreased by 0 1 and 0 1 mg kg that is 4 and 8 respectively in 20 140 cm soil profile the soil available p for df3 increased slightly by 0 2 mg kg 3 in 0 20 cm and 0 03 mg kg 2 in the 20 140 cm layers the corresponding values in the 0 20 and 20 140 cm layers for the df4 and df5 treatments increased by 0 3 4 0 mg kg that is 16 62 respectively it can be known that the fertilization rate of 20 45 led the soil available p depletion the fertilization rate of 95 120 caused the soil available p accumulation and the fertilization rate of 70 got a good balance for soil available p 3 3 winter wheat growth indicators the plant growth indicators including the largest h the maximum lai and the maximum aboveground dm are presented in fig 7 and the relationships between them and fertilization rates in 2014 2017 are shown in fig 8 the largest h for the df1 treatment was significantly lower than that for the df5 treatment in 2014 2015 in 2016 2017 the df1 h was significantly lower than the values for the other four treatments the average largest h in the three growing seasons were 67 1 71 2 70 6 71 8 and 71 8 cm for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively fig 7a the maximum dm for the df1 treatment was significantly lower than the values for the other four treatments in 2014 2015 in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 the maximum dm values for the df1 and df2 treatments were significantly lower than the values for the other three treatments the average dm was 2 42 2 63 2 83 2 82 and 2 99 g plant for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively fig 7b the maximum lai was significantly affected by the fertilization rate during the three years the maximum lai values for the df1 and df2 treatments were significantly lower than the values for the other three treatments the most significant differences among the five treatments were observed in 2016 2017 the average maximum lai values in the three winter wheat growing seasons were 3 97 4 64 5 48 5 83 and 6 37 m2 m2 for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively fig 7c as fig 8 shows there were significant positive linear correlations between the fertilization rate and the relative h p 0 05 as well as the lai and dm p 0 01 the maximum slope was obtained for the lai while the minimum was obtained for h similarly zhang et al 2013 and li et al 2016 also found that the lai and dm increased with an increase in the fertilization rate compared with df1 the maximum dm for the df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments increased by 8 6 16 7 14 9 and 23 5 respectively while the lai increased by 16 7 37 8 40 0 and 60 4 respectively 3 4 grain yield and yield components grain yield in winter wheat was significantly affected by the fertilizer application rate table 6 the grain yields for the df4 and df5 treatments were significantly higher than those for the df1 and df2 treatments in all three seasons but were not significantly higher than that for the df3 treatment considering the yield components the smp had significant effects on the spike number per hectare in all three years the spike numbers for the df4 and df5 treatments were significantly higher than those for the df1 and df2 treatments in all three seasons but were not significantly higher than that for the df3 treatment when the fertilization rate was increased from 20 to 120 the spike number per hectare in the df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments in comparison with df1 increased by 8 7 18 5 25 6 and 30 5 respectively no significant differences in the kernels per spike were observed among the five treatments expect for the lower spike numbers recorded in the df1 treatment during 2016 2017 the 1000 kernel weight was not significantly affected by the different smps in 2015 2017 these findings were very similar to those obtained by karam et al 2009 who demonstrated that the spike number per hectare was significantly influenced by fertilization rates and fertilization rates were observed not to have a significant effect on the 1000 grain weight this suggested that fertilization rates had a significant effect on the spike number per hectare and then the resulting yield differences the relationship between relative grain yield and fertilization rates in 2014 2017 is shown in fig 9 a regression analysis showed that there was a positive linear increase in yield with increasing fertigation rate among the fertigation treatments the yields increased rapidly by 0 61 with each unit of increase in the fertilization rate when the application rate was 20 70 p 0 01 at fertilization rates above 70 the increase in relative yield slowed by 0 32 with each unit of increase in the fertilization rate p 0 05 the results were similar to those reported by behera and panda 2009 who found that the grain yield increased with fertilization rate for wheat crops the mean grain yield in the three winter wheat growing seasons was 5017 1 5698 3 6549 4 6967 9 and 7337 7 kg ha for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively when compared to the local average winter wheat grain yield 6300 kg ha under a fertilization rate of 100 and surface irrigation in the experimental site the grain yield for the df1 and df2 treatments decreased by 20 4 and 9 6 while those for the df3 df4 and df5 treatments increased by 4 0 10 6 and 16 5 respectively 3 5 partial factor productivity and iwue partial factor productivity is a useful measure of fertilizer use efficiency and provides an integrative indicator of the soil nutrient levels and applied fertilization cassman et al 1998 the pfp for all treatments during 2014 2017 are detailed in table 6 in the three winter wheat growing seasons the pfp for the df1 treatment was significantly higher than the values for the other four treatments while the pfp for the df4 and df5 treatments was significantly lower than for the other three treatments the regression analysis showed that there was a negative power function relationship between the relative pfp and fertilization application rate p 0 01 the relative pfp decreased rapidly at fertilization rates of 20 70 and then more slowly at a fertilization rate of 70 fig 10 fang et al 2006 reported a similar tendency for winter wheat in the ncp the pfp in the three winter wheat growing seasons averaged 49 7 25 1 18 5 14 5 and 12 1 kg kg for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively compared to the local average pfp 12 5 kg kg under a fertilization rate of 100 at the experimental site the pfp increased by 298 2 101 0 48 5 and 16 4 in the df1 df2 df3 and df4 treatments respectively while that in the df5 treatment decreased by 2 9 the fertilization rates also had significant effects on iwue in 2014 2017 table 6 the iwue for the df3 df4 and df5 treatments was significantly higher than that for the df1 and df2 treatments this difference was mainly due to the difference in yield the average iwue in the three winter wheat growing seasons was 3 43 3 65 4 38 4 73 and 4 74 kg m3 for the df1 df2 df3 df4 and df5 treatments respectively a better drip fertigation scheduling could improve grain yield and fertilization efficiency and reduce the risk of environmental pollution as shown in this study soil available n and p at the harvest stage the largest h the maximum lai the maximum dm grain yield and pfp were all significantly correlated with the fertilization rate clearly a high fertilization rate did result in higher wheat growth indicators and grain yield but also significantly increased the available n and p accumulation in the soil profile compared with the initial available nutrient concentrations the fertilization rate of 45 70 got a relatively good balance of soil available n and the fertilization rate of 70 provided a good balance for soil available p at a fertilization rate of 70 grain yields reached 5912 2 6905 3 kg ha with an average of 6549 4 kg ha in all three growing seasons during 2014 2017 this was higher than the yields of the df1 and df2 treatments however no significant differences was found among the df3 df4 and df5 treatments p 0 05 compared to grain yield 6300 kg ha with a fertilization rate of 100 under surface irrigation the grain yield increased by 4 0 with the fertilization rate of 70 and decreased by 9 6 with the fertilization rate of 45 for farmers the primary concern is high yield not the water resources or environment therefore drip fertigation with 70 of the local recommended fertilization rate could be suggested to obtain both high grain yield and satisfactory environmental benefits 4 conclusions under drip irrigation based on the smp threshold of 40 kpa different fertilization rates had a significant effect on the soil available nutrient concentrations as more fertilizer was applied the soil available n and p concentrations in the 0 140 cm layers increased and more available n tended to leach to the deep layers of 100 140 cm and more available p inclined to accumulate in the upper layer of 0 20 cm compared with the initial soil nutrient the fertilization rate of 45 70 was enough to maintain the balance of soil available n and the fertilization rate of 70 could keep the balance of soil available p different fertilization levels had significant effects on winter wheat growth indicators and grain yield with the increase of fertilization rates the relative plant height maximum leaf area index and dry matter linearly increased the winter wheat yield increased rapidly when the fertilization rate was between 20 and 70 and increased slowly when it was higher than 70 the pfp decreased in a power function with an increase in the fertilization rate compared with the average grain yield 6300 kg ha and pfp 12 5 kg kg under surface irrigation with local recommended fertilizer dose the yield decreased by 9 6 and the pfp increased by 101 0 at fertilization rate of 45 and at fertilization rate of 70 the yield and pfp increased by 4 0 and 48 5 respectively considering the relative high grain yield high fertilizer use efficiency and minimum accumulation of n and p in soil it is suggested to drip fertigation levels of 70 of the local recommended dose 235 kg ha n and 118 kg ha p2o5 for winter wheat production in the ncp declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest acknowledgements this study was supported by the
