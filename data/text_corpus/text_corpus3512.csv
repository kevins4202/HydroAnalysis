17560,solar disinfection sodis in 2 l bottles is a well established drinking water treatment technique suitable for rural peri urban or isolated communities in tropical or sub tropical climates in this work we assess the enlargement of the treatment volume by using cheap large scale plastic vessels the bactericidal performance of sodis and two solar fe2 based enhancements namely photo fenton light h2o2 fe2 and peroxymonosulfate activation light pms fe2 were assessed in 19 l polycarbonate pc and 25 l polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles in ultrapure and real water matrices tap water lake geneva water although sodis always reached total 5 logu inactivation under solar light enhancement by or both fe2 h2o2 or fe2 pms was always beneficial and led to an increase in bacterial elimination kinetics as high as 2 fold in pc and pet bottles with tap water for light h2o2 fe2 and 8 fold in pet bottles with lake geneva water the toxicological safety of the enhancements and their effects on the plastic container materials was assessed using the e screen assay and the ames test after 1 day or 1 week exposure to sodis photo fenton and persulfate activation although the production of estrogenic compounds was observed we report that no treatment method duration of exposure or material resulted in estrogenicity risk for humans and similarly no mutagenicity risk was measured in summary we suggest that sodis enhancement by either ho or so 4 based advanced oxidation process is a suitable enhancement of bacterial inactivation in large scale plastic bottles without any associated toxicity risks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords solar disinfection sodis drinking water oxidation process toxicity plastic leachables e coli 1 introduction solar disinfection sodis is a world health organization who approved intervention for the generation of safe drinking water prior to consumption its success is based on its simplicity in which a transparent container is filled with the available water and exposed to sunlight for one day under normal irradiation conditions or two days under cloudy skies mcguigan et al 2012 after this time the microbial load and especially bacterial counts are significantly lower and the water is safer to drink the interventions that have been successfully implemented all verified the acceptance of this method from the local population due to its simplicity since only a water container usually a 2 l polyethylene terephthalate pet bottle provided to the population participating in the actions heat and sunlight are involved despite its easy protocol there are several pitfalls in the application that have instigated research over the past 30 years since the first guidelines were published wegelin et al 1994 for instance solar light is comprised of uvc light which does not reach the earth s crust uvb uva visible and infrared light ir some materials used for sodis vessels e g polycarbonate or pet are partially or completely opaque to uvb wegelin et al 2001 uva is significantly less energetic than uvb sinton et al 1999 visible light is abundant but almost harmless to microorganisms and ir heats up water the corresponding mode of action of each of the wavelengths has been recently reviewed giannakis et al 2016 nelson et al 2018 briefly the main actions are uvb light acts directly on the microorganism genome mutating its genetic material oppezzo 2012 pfeifer et al 2005 uva initiates oxidative chain reactions into the cell in bacteria berney et al 2006 bosshard et al 2010a 2010b giannakis 2018 hoerter et al 2005 or matrix related oxidative processes rosado lausell et al 2013 vione et al 2010 2006 visible light in the received intensities does not contribute much hessling et al 2017 ng et al 2016 although recent reports indicate blue light mediated bacterial inactivation halstead et al 2019 maclean et al 2014 and the heat from ir light denatures proteins causing lethal damage baatout et al 2005 blaustein et al 2013 from the above description of the mode of action of sodis and its applications some obvious problems arise which researchers have attempted to resolve over the past 30 years for instance pet filters out uvb hence the efficacy of the process is reduced consequently uvb transparent materials such as pyrex bottles or polycarbonate vessels have been studied castro alférez et al 2018 fisher et al 2012a keogh et al 2015 uvb on the other hand mainly damages the genome which means that the cell may still retain a capacity to repair its damage via dark or light assisted processes and re populate the water giannakis et al 2014a vélez colmenares et al 2012 hence oxidative processes have been proposed as improvements to the sodis process byrne et al 2015 ndounla and pulgarin 2014 polo lópez et al 2018 among these processes photo fenton spuhler et al 2010 and more recently persulfate activation guerra rodríguez et al 2018 seem to be sodis compatible since they exploit the majority of the solar spectrum huang et al 2018 mosteo et al 2020 rodríguez chueca et al 2017 their reactants fe2 h2o2 are benign part of the natural photochemical cycle voelker et al 1997 or they leave harmless residual compounds so 4 2 in the case of persulfate matzek and carter 2016 the efficacy of these processes has been documented in field tests the generated oxidative species such as the ho and so 4 inactivate cells by intracellular and or extracellular disruption of their structural integrity and vital functions castro alférez et al 2016 ferreira et al 2020 giannakis et al 2018 xiao et al 2020 hence they have proven regrowth elimination capacity moncayo lasso et al 2009 ndounla et al 2013 rincón and pulgarin 2007 and since they utilize relatively cheap reagents many successful lab scale tests have been described in the literature another issue highlighted frequently in feedback from communities using sodis is that it is a labor intensive process and the low batch volume of the bottles commonly used i e 2 l pet is not well suited to family requirements since the early 2000 s there have been many studies focusing on enlarging the treated volumes by solar collector reactors of higher capacity e g 20 25 l up to 32 54 l and 88 140 l bichai et al 2012 martínez garcía et al 2020 nalwanga et al 2014 polo lópez et al 2011 reyneke et al 2020 ubomba jaswa et al 2010 and larger than the standard pet plastic bottles such as 19 l polycarbonate bottles and 5 or 20 l polypropylene buckets keogh et al 2015 polo lópez et al 2019 the apparent problems that were quickly addressed in the engineered systems cpcs were the increase of the optical path which is not beneficial for light transmission and the lower water temperatures generated in larger volumes the latter has been proven a crucial parameter in the absence of light but in abundant illumination it has a complementary synergistic character castro alférez et al 2017 giannakis et al 2014b mcguigan et al 1998 concerning the larger vessels a vast series of materials pvc pmma pet pc and others has recently been investigated on their light transmittance garcía gil et al 2020a more specifically aspects such as the wall thickness and wavelength dependent light extinction have been examined because they ultimately affect the time required for total inactivation of bacteria exposing water in plastic reactors to intense conditions of heat and light raises questions regarding the formation of photoproducts and the migration of compounds from the containers into the water which might be harmful to the consumer food contact materials are regulated by european regulation no 1935 2004 european commission 2004 which states that material in contact with food which also includes drinking water should not transfer its constituents to the food in quantities that could incur a risk to human health the more recent european regulation no 10 2011 european commission 2011 specifically covers plastic food contact materials fcm and lists the compounds authorized for use in their manufacture however while intentionally added substances in plastics may be safe for the consumer non intentionally added substances nias in the final plastic material can be toxic to the consumer bach et al 2013 in vitro bioassays such as the ames test and the e screen assay offer robust and economic solutions to screen for toxicity of fcm groh and muncke 2017 a limited number of toxicity studies have been carried out on the sodis process the ames test has been used to test pet bottled water in sodis like conditions de fusco et al 1990 monarca et al 1994 ubomba jaswa et al 2010 however there are no reports of toxicity testing for advanced oxidative processes furthermore studies to date have focused on pet plastic and so it was of interest to investigate toxicity associated with the advanced oxidative processes photo fenton and persulfate activation using pet and other plastics the present study aims to fill the knowledge gap concerning the suitability of large volume plastic containers as sodis or solar assisted aops reactors and the safety of these materials in this regard for this purpose we have assessed two large volume vessels for their suitability as sodis and solar assisted oxidative processes reactors for water treatment in the field more specifically a standard blue tinted 19 l polycarbonate pc water dispenser bottle and a 25 l polyethylene terephthalate pet jerrycan have been subjected to conditions of solar disinfection sodis no additives solar light h2o2 photo fenton solar light h2o2 fe2 solar light peroxymonosulfate pms and double pms activation solar light pms fe2 the level of e coli inactivation during these processes was monitored and the differences when distilled water control tap water and lake geneva water were used as experimentation matrix are reported finally the suitability of the materials was studied by assessing the toxicity of the migrating compounds the estrogenic and mutagenic effects of sodis ho based and so 4 based aops was estimated after 1 or 7 days of consecutive tests 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents iron ii sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o 99 peroxymonosulfate triple salt pms oxone potassium peroxydisulfate pds and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 were all provided by sigma aldrich switzerland the plate count agar and reagents for the preparation of the bacteriological media nacl kcl yeast extract were also acquired from sigma aldrich switzerland while bacto tryptone was purchased from bd biosciences switzerland beta estradiol e2 ici 182 780 fulvestrant and cell culture media and supplements were purchased from sigma aldrich ireland 2 2 water matrices in order to assess the differences and effects of water components on bacterial disinfection the tests took place in distilled water di tap water without further pretreatment or chloride removal and lake geneva water from the nearby pumping station of st sulpice lausanne switzerland the main physicochemical characteristics of the water matrices are summarized in table 1 obtained from own measurements and the lausanne water services 2 3 bacterial preparation and enumeration methods the e coli k12 wildtype strain was originally obtained from the german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures dsmz strain no 498 and stored in 20 glycerol at 20 c the preparation method was previously published in detail giannakis et al 2013 marjanovic et al 2018 briefly one colony from a pre culture was inoculated in 5 ml of sterilized luria bertani lb broth 10 g l bacto tryptone 10 g l nacl and 5 g l nacl the dispersion was incubated at 37 c under shaking at 180 rpm for 8 h afterwards 1 dilution was performed in lb and the solution was further incubated for 15 h under the same conditions e coli were separated from the medium by centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 15 min at 4 c followed by a rinsing step with a sterile saline solution 8 g l nacl and 0 8 g l kcl the process was repeated three times for 5 min under the same conditions the bacterial pellet was finally suspended in 25 ml of saline solution the concentration of the resulting bacterial stock was 109 colony forming units per ml cfu ml the initial concentration of 105 cfu ml which was used throughout the disinfection experiments was obtained by dilution and was estimated by the standard plate count method on non selective plate count agar pca pca plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 c followed by manual colony counting 2 4 plastics used in the study three types of plastic containers were used in the study polyethylene terephthalate pet from a 25 l transparent container which we used as jerrycan petjc pet from a 500 ml coca cola bottle petcc and blue polycarbonate pc from a 19 l container used in a water dispenser see table 2 for more information prior to the disinfection tests the used coca cola bottles were washed with ethanol warm water with soap and rinsed multiple times with di water after the disinfection tests and prior to toxicity testing the pieces of plastic were cleaned with 70 ethanol rinsed with di water and cut into small pieces of 4 4mm2 2 5 experimental strategy of disinfection tests and toxicity assays the objective of the study was to study the solar assisted bacterial disinfection in large volume reactors the disinfection tests took place in the pet jerrycans and blue pc bottles the disinfection capacity of solar light photo fenton and solar fe2 activated peroxymonosulfate were assessed in di water blank tap water real matrix in absence of organic matter and lake geneva water real water matrix with organic matter solar disinfection no additives solar light h2o2 photo fenton solar light h2o2 fe2 solar light pms and double pms activation solar light pms fe2 were assessed for their bactericidal efficacy sodis hv is considered the baseline process the hv h2o2 and photo fenton processes are the ho producing group of aops while hv pms and hv pms fe2 are producing both ho and so 4 for the assessment of the toxicological safety of the plastic materials a battery of tests was applied after disinfection to achieve reproducible results in the most unfavorable conditions the plastics were cut and the migrating substances toxicity was separately evaluated to ensure a benchmark comparison with the new food approved pet jerrycan petjc another already food approved pet material was used pet from coca cola bottles petcc the plastic bottles were cut in pieces and the respective amounts of material were submerged in 1 l of milli q mq water in a borosilicate glass vessel petjc 8 3 g petcc 15 g and polycarbonate pc 14 5 g the quantities of plastic used corresponded to the internal surface exposed for each original container from which the plastic would leach into the water divided by the quantity of water treated by the vessel the use of mq water prevented any interference from the water matrix and the use of borosilicate glass vessel any further leachables generation for the toxicity tests solar light photo fenton and pds activation instead of pms by solar light and fe2 were assessed pms activation leads to hydroxyl and sulfate radicals generation hence in order to dissociate the effects of so 4 pds was used as a precursor to avoid simultaneous ho generation by the oxidant and have only the possibility of its partial generation from side reactions so 4 reaction with ho 2 6 solar based treatment methods used in the study the disinfection tests were carried out on the terrace of the swiss federal polytechnic school chemistry building under clear days in july and august lat 46 5191 n long 6 5668 e the bottles were placed standing on their base on a metallic surface sub optimal configuration for reflectance and effective irradiation surface area use to simulate as unfavorable conditions as possible on the assumption that any enhancements might be more readily observed see fig s1 for the setup configuration the global solar irradiance was monitored using a kipp zonen cm3 pyranometer and the values were recorded automatically in 1 min intervals from which the total solar energy was calculated while temperature was recorded manually the selected concentrations were fe2 1 ppm 18 μm η2ο2 10 ppm 290 μm for the solar h2o2 and the photo fenton processes while fe2 1 ppm 18 μm and 2 74 mg l oxone 36 μm were used for the solar and solar fe2 activation of pms kinetic analysis was performed in origin software by fitting log linear curves for the toxicity tests solar irradiation was simulated by a suntest solar simulator using a 1500 w xe lamp with a wavelength spectral distribution of approx 0 5 of emitted photons 320 nm uv b range and about 5 7 between 300 and 400 nm uva range the emission spectrum between 400 and 800 nm follows the solar spectrum light intensity was set at 1000 w m2 and was pre calibrated with a kipp zonen cm3 pyranometer the irradiation experiments were started at room temperature 25 c and the temperature of the solution increased up to approximately 30 c during irradiation due to the air cooling system of the suntest all experiments were carried out in equilibrium with air agitation at 700 rpm three different treatments were used solar disinfection

peroxydisulfate pds and 1 ppm 18 μm fe2 the values were selected for their expected efficacy according to previous studies marjanovic et al 2018 rodríguez chueca et al 2019 two time periods of irradiation were investigated 6 consecutive hours for 1 day and 6 consecutive hours a day for 7 consecutive days 1 week corresponding control vessels were incubated in the dark following incubation

agents to damage the genetic material in the cells samples for testing were first extracted using the spe method described above the samples were concentrated 1000 fold and 10μl volumes were tested for mutagenicity genotoxicity using the ames ii kit by xenometrix ag allschwil switzerland the kit contains s typhimurium strains ta98 used for the detection of frameshift mutations and tamix a mixture of equal proportions of the ames ii ta7001 ta7006 strains to detect base pair substitutions freshly prepared overnight cultures of ta98 and tamix were exposed to the test sample as well as to a positive and negative control for 90 min in exposure medium containing sufficient histidine to support a few cell divisions after 90 min exposure cultures were diluted in ph indicator medium lacking histidine and aliquoted into 48 wells of a 384 well plate within 2 days cells that had undergone the reversion to histidine prototrophy either spontaneously or as a result of the exposure to a mutagen grew into colonies bacterial metabolism reduces the ph of the medium changing the color of that well from purple to yellow the number of wells containing revertant colonies was counted for each sample and compared to a solvent negative control the result was expressed as the fold increase over the baseline which was the ratio of the mean number of positive wells for the dose concentration divided by the baseline the baseline was obtained by adding one standard deviation to the mean number of positive wells of the solvent control a sample that showed a clear fold induction 2 above the baseline was classified as a mutagen the mutagenic potential of the samples was assessed directly and in the presence of liver s9 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli disinfection tests in pc and pet bottles under sodis and oxidative methods figs 1 4 summarize the disinfection experiments that took place in the two large scale bottles namely the 19 l blue polycarbonate bottle and the 25 l polyethylene terephthalate jerrycan hereon pc and pet respectively since the bacterial inactivation mechanisms of sodis hv h2o2 hv h2o2 fe2 photo fenton hv pms and hv pms fe2 have been previously discussed in the introduction section interested readers should refer to s giannakis et al 2016 marjanovic et al 2018 rodríguez chueca et al 2019 xiao et al 2019 here we will not extensively discuss the pathways to inactivation but will focus only on the main driving forces under the given conditions and the new propositions due to the changes in the container material and the water matrix in which the experiments took place 3 1 1 19 l pc bottle with di water fig 1 showcases the experiments that took place in pc bottle in di water solar disinfection hv alone attained total 5 logu bacterial inactivation within a reasonable timeframe 90 min given the moderate ambient temperatures the kinetics resemble the typical log linear inactivation after a lag period our results are in accordance with the ones of keogh et al keogh et al 2015 where total inactivation of 6 log e coli was attained in 2 h in spain in similar reactors same material volume color and thickness sodis inactivates bacteria mainly via the solar light uv and visible wavelengths optical pathways and heat thermal pathway the temperature during experimentation never surpassed 32 c which is not expected to inactivate bacteria on the contrary it is close to the optimal temperature for the survival of the mesophilic e coli 37 c giannakis et al 2014b hence inactivation is attributed solely to the light mediated pathways similarly to keogh et al keogh et al 2015 the pc reactor permits the transmittance of the uv part in the uvb region of 290 320 nm which has significant germicidal capacity and the uva region 320 400 nm which initiates a lethal intracellular cascade of oxidation events in bacteria transmittance of pc see fig s2 however the transmittance reaches a plateau around 55 for the visible light although visible light has limited effect in the direct e coli inactivation its participation is crucial in the other processes to be discussed at later stage addition of h2o2 in the water bulk enhanced e coli inactivation 26 because it initiates two parallel disinfection events i the extracellular oxidation and ii after the passage of h2o2 into the cell the enhancement of the oxidative events initiated by uvb and uva light the simultaneous presence of h2o2 and fe2 induces the generation of hydroxyl radicals in the bulk and into the cell via the fenton process hence the observed enhancement of e coli inactivation compared to sodis 116 fe3 precipitates in near neutral ph hence the photo fenton is driven by colloidal iron forms iron oxides and water bound ligands farinelli et al 2020 which considering the different kinetics of heterogeneous processes against the homogeneous ones explain the short delay shown the addition of pms into the water bulk enhanced sodis 47 initiating the oxidation of e coli similarly to previous works rodríguez chueca et al 2019 2017 in the pc reactor we attain an activation of the pms to generate hydroxyl and sulfate radicals via the homolysis of the oo bond although only uvc light was believed to activate the peroxide bond recently uvb and uva irradiation have shown to be able to activate pds and h2o2 and initiate the generation of radicals huang et al 2018 in fact in pms this process should be easier due to the asymmetric structure of the precursor molecule when compared with pds flanagan et al 1984 addition of fe2 will initiate another pathway the metal induced pms activation with fe2 oxidation to fe3 however pms has been proven to reduce fe3 to fe2 allowing its further activation with the simultaneous production of so 5 radical which is considered to have germicidal capacities rodríguez chueca et al 2019 hence the consecutive addition of pms and pms fe2 under solar light induces an increase in the inactivation kinetics 177 a summary of the kinetics from which the improvement was calculated is presented in table 3 3 1 2 19 l pc bottle with tap water fig 2 summarizes the experiments that took place in the same reactor but in tap water instead of di water firstly similar temperature profiles between the days of experimentation in di and tap water are reported hence there are no differences in thermal induced effects e g light thermal synergy castro alférez et al 2017 mcguigan et al 1998 or pms activation rodríguez chueca et al 2019 table 1 of the materials and methods details the differences among the two matrices with the two most significant being the alkaline ph of tap water 8 15 the presence of ions and a small absorbance in the far uvb region under solar light the ph does not significantly influence bacterial inactivation but the presence of ions eases the osmotic pressure that e coli suffer in their absence in di water also some of the ions contained the water have a small light absorbance rommozzi et al 2020 hence the little difference in the uv vis absorption spectra between di and tap water fig s3 these two actions lead to a 50 decrease in disinfection kinetics in tap water the changes in ph and the presence of ions have a more significant influence in the radical based processes more specifically all processes are hindered significantly by the changes in the matrix except h2o2 13 its main action mode after diffusion into the cell does not get highly affected h2o2 is an uncharged compound and the change of the overall e coli charge at the new ph isoelectric point of e coli 4 likely 2 5 hairden and harris 1953 rijnaarts et al 1995 does not hinder its passing into the cell however the addition of fe2 and the induction of the photo fenton process is significantly affected 68 although the photo fenton process eventually inactivates e coli 45 faster than sodis we observe that the kinetics are slower than the absence of fe2 as it can be seen in figure s4 the addition of fe2 in tap water leads to a rapid oxidation and a yellow tint in water from the beginning of the experiment hence the slow plateau like performance of the photo fenton process the delay of the process can be attributed to the light attenuation of the precipitated iron garcía gil et al 2020b a similar problem was encountered in another study with the same tap water pulgarin et al 2020 and the use of citrate was employed as an iron chelator to prevent its rapid precipitation also scavenging of ho is expected c l hco 3 and no 3 react with ho to generate cl co 3 and no 3 radicals which are less oxidative than ho hence less germicidal while sulfates scavenging does not lead to reactive radicals at this ph rommozzi et al 2020 the hv pms process is also affected by the change in ph 66 the reasons between this delay are most likely i the difficulty to come in contact with e coli and induce extracellular oxidation e coli are now more negative and hso 5 is an anion ii the ineffective reaction of pms with water components e g with cl that generates less oxidative radicals iii and the shift from a so 4 to a more ho dominated inactivation process liu et al 2015 due to the high presence of oh all possibilities are corroborated by the higher reduction in the efficacy of hv pms than the respective hv h2o2 process also especially in the case where pms is activated by fe the same optical reasons that delayed photo fenton also apply here leading to an 83 kinetics reduction compared to the di water experiments furthermore the so 4 generated is less scavenged by water matrix ions than ho wang et al 2020 hence the hv fe2 activation of pms results in basic ph results in slower kinetics than the hv pms process despite the possibility of pms to reduce fe the generation of so 5 is also not the most effective way to inactivate e coli we should note here that in terms of inactivation kinetics the h2o2 based processes enhanced sodis more than the pms ones for the selected amounts of fe h2o2 and pms more specifically the benefit of adding h2o2 or h2o2 fe2 in the sodis process is 130 and 45 respectively while for the pms and pms fe2 additions the increase in pc and tap water is negligible 8 and 5 hence the h2o2 based processes seem to be better enhanced in pc bottles 3 1 3 25 l pet jerrycan with tap water fig 3 details the experiments that took place in the 25 l pet jerrycan and the point of comparison is the plastics used in the reactor i e we will not repeat the ion related issues discussed in fig 2 the first difference is the slightly higher volume of the pet jerrycan 25 vs 19 l but the optical pathway of the two reactors is relatively close so we do not consider it a key aspect the bottles differences were summarized in table 2 also we can factor out any temperature influence due to the consistency of the weather during the days of experimentation the inactivation kinetics of sodis alone were very similar in the two types of reactor in the pet bottle almost the same dose was necessary to achieve 5 logu reduction of the bacterial load compared to the pc reactor only 6 faster in pc in our opinion this fact is actually a coincidence considering the big differences in the reactor color thickness and consequently the transmission in the water bulk firstly pc does allow some uvb to get transmitted into the water bulk but pet effectively blocks all wavelengths below 320 nm 0 8 transmittance at 319 nm 1 95 at 320 nm see fig s2 moreover it has been recently calculated that the thickness and the material can greatly influence the outcome of the disinfection process garcía gil et al 2020a between a pc bottle with 2 mm thickness and a pet one with 0 5 the pet shows more than 25 higher uv vis transmittance our material is 1 5 mm thick but has a blue tint so this range of reported difference is not far from our case hence we have to consider a complete shift in the underlying inactivation mechanisms induced by light alone in pc uvb acts at dna level and uva induces the intracellular photo fenton process but in pet bottles the former is not active at all however the uva levels transmitted in the pet jerrycan are significantly higher than the pc and most likely compensate the loss of the highly energetic uvb photons by the ample transmittance of the uva ones these results cannot be scaled with the ones by keogh et al keogh et al 2015 since a 2 l pet bottle was used there but the transmittance of the jerrycan is comparable with the standard sodis bottle if not a little higher fig s2 hence the material is an excellent choice for sodis no worse than the pc tested before by keogh et al keogh et al 2015 the transparent color of the pet jerrycan and its smaller thickness allows significantly higher light transmittance in the pet reactor in the uva vis region this fact affects the performance of some of the oxidative processes more specifically the hv h2o2 process is mildly affected 4 logu instead of 5 logu reduction in 1000 wh m2 16 due to this shift the reason is that pet does not allow uvb transmittance which still has a small capacity of homolytic disruption of h2o2 to generate ho hence the experiments in pet lose this pathway compared to pc due to the tenfold drop of the homolytic quantum yield between uvb and uva zuo and hoigne 1992 nevertheless the much higher uva vis light transmitted in presence of h2o2 allows the intracellular photo fenton to take place and compensate the loss of the extracellular pathway hence the overall efficacy remains the same the photo fenton process itself is now not hampered 24 kinetics increase since the pet allows higher uva transmittance that initiates the intracellular events but also an important difference in visible light which also affects e coli mosteo et al 2020 and assists in iron recycling increasing the small extent that it takes place intracellular events lmct in the bacterial cell wall giannakis et al 2018 the hv pms process is highly benefited from the change in material 118 increase in kinetics as a matter of fact almost half the energy is required to inactivate 5 logu of e coli the explanation behind this change lies within the photo activity of pms in the uv vis range fig s5 depicts the molar absorption coefficient of h2o2 and pms where significantly higher values are observed for the latter as such we postulate that uva and vis light can effectively activate pms being the only wavelengths that are transmitted in the reactor furthermore although the pet does not permit uvb the significantly higher uva and visible light transmitted over compensate its loss uva and visible light have been previously proved to synergistically inactivate e coli rodríguez chueca et al 2019 and is verified here as well the addition of fe2 similarly to the photo fenton process although it reduces the efficacy of the hv pms process the difference is now much lower with hv pms most likely due to the fe3 pms activity reported in literature fe3 under uva vis has been found to enhance pms mediated degradation of contaminants hasan et al 2020 also almost half the required energy is required for the total e coli inactivation in the pet jerrycan compared to the pc bottle 114 increase in kinetics the iron related mechanisms are functioning in a higher degree than the pc bottle hence the overall decrease in solar energy dose hence the pet at these dimensions and thickness despite the loss of the uvb photons is deemed a good alternative material for both sodis and oxidative processes it is noteworthy that for the selected amounts of fe h2o2 and pms the addition of h2o2 and h2o2 fe2 in the sodis process resulted in 106 and 93 increase in tap water in the pet jerrycan while 152 and 140 were the corresponding pms and pms fe2 increases in kinetics compared to sodis there is no doubt that the addition of at least the oxidant greatly impacts the inactivation kinetics also compared with the levels of enhancement noted in the pc bottle reactor 130 45 8 5 the h2o2 ones performed similarly slightly better but the pms processes effectiveness increased dramatically as such one may attribute h2o2 based enhancements in pc reactors which allow more uvb while pms based enhancements should be preferred in pet reactors 3 1 4 25 l pet jerrycan with lake geneva water finally fig 4 summarizes the solar based experiments that took place in the pet jerrycan but in lake geneva water the main difference is the change of matrix hence the pathways under question are the changes inflicted by the slightly higher ph 8 3 instead of 8 15 the ions compared to tap water and not the uv vis transmittance of the material sodis took place effectively but was significantly delayed compared to the tap water experiments in these experiments a max difference of 3 c was observed but since it is way below the germicidal threshold or the threshold to activate pms 40 c rodríguez chueca et al 2019 we do not consider this as an influential factor the main characteristic that differed among the experiments with tap water and lake water was the organic matter content although dom has been long recognized as a source of bactericidal ros and transient species kohantorabi et al 2019 vione et al 2014 the dominant effect of its presence is the light filter ng et al 2014 most likely the absence of the uvb irradiation due to the pet is of key influence for the generation of transient species serna galvis et al 2018 the hv h2o2 process was severely hampered in lake water besides the already discussed loss of ho due to the lack of uvb irradiation the small amount of ho generated is diminished by the inner filter effect of dom and the ho are most likely being scavenged by the dom itself as a target vione et al 2006 the addition of fe2 has a detrimental effect on the efficacy on the process although more uva is available in pet the lake water shows a higher absorbance after the addition of fe most likely via its complexation by dom and the generation of photo active complexes fig s3 in some works these complexes have been expected to contribute to maintaining the iron in solution and assist the photo fenton process giannakis et al 2016 porras et al 2018 rodríguez chueca et al 2014 and indeed this may happen here in a small extent nevertheless the possible higher ho generation is scavenged by dom as shown by the different spectra of tap and lake water fig s3 surprisingly the hv pms process was not as scavenged as the hv h2o2 process this means that the activation of pms by light although smaller hence slower kinetics continued to generate ho and so 4 considering that so 4 reacts much more slowly with dom compared to ho this explains why this process could maintain a high bactericidal efficacy the addition of fe2 was once again found to be detrimental to the hv pms efficacy but not high enough to hinder the solar initiated pathways hence the pms assisted processes are more effective than the respective h2o2 ones in natural waters if one compares the kinetics of sodis with the attained by the h2o2 based processes 231 and 141 increase or with the pms based processes 715 and 538 increase for the selected amounts of fe h2o2 and pms the importance of enhancing sodis with either process h2o2 or pms based is more than obvious what is more important is that the pms based processes led to even higher enhancements hence their superiority in pet reactors with natural waters is verified 3 1 5 significance of the disinfection findings as a provisional conclusion similarly to keogh et al and garcia gil et al garcía gil et al 2020a keogh et al 2015 we can verify that both the 19 l pc water cooler bottles and the 25 l pet jerrycans are good candidates for sodis containers but also our new results prove that they are suitable vectors for solar based advanced oxidation processes based on either ho and so 4 the differences between material properties lead to changes in the pathways of bacterial inactivation but both materials ensured total inactivation in less than 3 4 h in any matrix in compliance with the 1 day exposure necessities of sodis even at high volumes and at modest temperatures also the addition of oxidants h2o2 pms and fe2 all enhanced sodis the studied oxidative processes were more effective than sodis hence the beneficial impact of ho and so 4 cannot be doubted despite the generally unfavorable conditions namely i high ph in our matrices alkaline ph ii the subsequent precipitation of iron and the possible deposition on the wall of the reactors which may result in lower light penetration iii the passive convectional mixing only due to temperature gradients and iv the heterogeneous catalytic pathways the processes were found to be suitable and effective in reducing the bacterial load however before any conclusive recommendation can be made regarding the suitability of the process and the material selection the effect of each process on the material must be assessed 3 2 toxicity assays plastic leachables 3 2 1 proliferative effects of leachables following 6 h of irradiation the proliferative effects of migrating substances from petjc petcc and blue pc plastic polymers following 6 h of irradiation with sodis photo fenton and persulfate activation hv pds fe2 reactions are described in fig 5 in order to isolate the effects of plastic from other potential sources of contamination ultrapure mq water was used and pds as an exclusive sulfate radical generator was employed instead of pms the e screen assay was carried out in the presence and absence of ici 182 780 an estrogen receptor antagonist to confirm whether any chemicals released under sodis photo fenton and pds activation processes were estrogenic following 6 h irradiation no significant estrogenic activity was detected for petjc pieces for any of the treatments fig 5 calculated relative proliferative effect rpe values of migrating substances from petjc were around 5 for the photo fenton treatment 7 for the pds activation and 18 for sodis table 4 these rpe values indicated that petjc samples were very weak or non existent agonists of estradiol and were therefore not estrogenic on the other hand evidence of estrogenic activity was apparent in migrating substances from petcc following 6 h irradiation relative to the negative control petcc stimulated growth by 153 20 following sodis 239 32 following photo fenton conditions and by 184 23 following a pds activation process fig 5 the data show an increase of approximately 31 86 in proliferation when sodis irradiation treatment was enhanced these proliferative effects translate to rpe of 76 for photo fenton treatment 67 for pds activation treatment and around 43 for sodis table 4 these results suggest that substances released from petcc act as partial agonists of the estradiol receptor migrating substances from the pc bottle stimulated growth by 151 42 following sodis for 6 h fig 5 however this was not significantly different from the negative control substances released from pc after 6 h photo fenton and pds activation reactions stimulated proliferation by 190 29 and by 164 4 respectively the substances migrating from pc after 6 h of photo fenton irradiation treatment had rpe of approximately 81 which implies that these released substances act as partial total agonists of the estradiol receptor table 4 on the other hand substances migrating from pc after 6 h of pds activation triggered an rpe of 49 which suggests they are weak partial agonists of the estradiol receptor table 4 3 2 2 proliferative effects of leachables following 7 days of irradiation evidence of time dependent estrogenic activity of chemicals released from petjc after 1 week of irradiation was shown relative to the negative control petjc leachates after 1 week of sodis stimulated growth by 210 21 interestingly no further increase in proliferation was observed when sodis was enhanced the substances released after 1 week under photo fenton irradiation and pds activation stimulated proliferation by 216 18 and by 244 36 respectively fig 6 the rpe values of the leachates from petjc polymer after 1 week under irradiation treatment were 80 which indicated a strong estradiol agonistic effect of the samples table 4 also important to note here is that prolonged irradiation of petcc for a week did not significantly enhance estrogenic activity when compared to the levels of estrogenicity detected following 6 h irradiation of the samples however enhanced sodis conditions with petcc led to a 41 43 increase in proliferation estrogenic activity of migrating chemicals from petcc released after 1 week under sodis photo fenton and pds activation conditions were 139 7 180 26 and 182 23 respectively relative to the control fig 6 rpe values between approximately 33 67 indicate that the leachates released from the petcc after one week of irradiation treatment act as partial agonists of the estradiol receptor evidence of time dependent estrogenic activity was also apparent in pc leachables prolonged irradiation of pc over the course of 1 week enhanced estrogenic activity when compared to the estrogenic activity of the samples irradiated for 6 h estrogenic activity of released substances from blue pc under sodis photo fenton and pds activation were 216 21 221 21 and 238 7 respectively relative to the control fig 6 the rpe values of the pc irradiated for 1 week were 80 table 4 meaning that they are strong estradiol agonists moreover pc leachates from advanced oxidative processes were above 100 indicating an estrogenic affect more potent than the one exerted by the positive control estradiol co incubation of all leachates with ici had a negligible effect on growth compared with the negative control confirming the presence of estrogenic leachables see fig 6 3 2 3 estradiol equivalents eeqs estradiol equivalent values eeqs were calculated for all leachates that showed an increased proliferative effect to benchmark water in terms of acceptable daily intake limit of β estradiol set by jecfa 2000 table 4 eeq values calculated from the dose response curve of 17β estradiol were corrected for the concentration factor used since water samples were concentrated 10 000 fold via spe and diluted 100 fold in the e screen the final concentration factor for every sample was 100 derived eeqs were reported as ng l the values calculated ranged from 0 008 5 9 ng l following 6 h irradiation the eeq values for the samples from the blue polycarbonate polymer pc were in the order of 0 03 0 57 ng l and were the highest values obtained for all three plastics eeq values for the petjc samples were 103 to 106 times lower than 1 ng l while the eeq values for petcc samples were greater than the values for the petjc and were in the order of 0 03 0 42 ng l following 1 week of irradiation the eeq values for the pc samples were in the order of 1 3 5 9 ng l and were again the highest values obtained for all three plastics for that period of irradiation eeq values of the petjc samples were in the order of 0 6 1 5 ng l while the eeq values for petcc samples were in the order of 0 008 0 2 ng l and unlike following 6 h of irradiation were lower than the values obtained for the petjc assuming a 3 5 kg baby consumes 0 52 l water through breast milk the daily consumption of estradiol from the pds irradiated water sample having the highest eeq value would be 0 9 ng kg of body weight the corresponding value for an adult of 65 kg that drinks 2 l of water per day would be 0 2 ng kg of body weight all values calculated were within the adi range 0 50 ng kg body weight of estradiol recommended by the jecfa world health organization 2006 3 2 4 mutagenicity of leachables no mutagenicity was detected for any sample when tested using the ames test as no value obtained showed a clear fold induction 2 above the baseline value table 5 3 2 5 significance of the toxicological findings known substances and unknown nias can migrate from plastics in contact with water and so testing the overall migrate using in vitro tests offers a pragmatic and cost effective approach to toxicity testing in vitro toxicity testing performed with fcms has focused on 3 main types of toxicity namely cytotoxicity genotoxicity and endocrine activity groh and muncke 2017 in this study genotoxicity was tested using the ames test and endocrine activity was determined using the e screen assay the study by de fusco et al in 1990 was among the earliest investigations for the presence of toxins in bottled water de fusco et al 1990 they studied the leaching of mutagens into mineral water from pet bottles using the ames test following short and long term storage in light and dark the results identified leaching of mutagens after 1 month of storage but not after 3 or 6 months of storage the mutagenic activity detected in the water stored for 1 month in pet was higher after storage in daylight compared with storage in the dark since then a number of similar studies have been carried out bach et al 2014 2013 monarca et al 1994 ubomba jaswa et al 2010 as was the case in this study no mutagenicity was reported in any of these studies with the exception of that by ubomba jaswa et al ubomba jaswa et al 2010 however in their study while genotoxicity was detected after 2 months in water stored in pet bottles and exposed continuously without refilling to sunlight toxicity was also detected in pet bottles stored in the dark after 2 months making it unlikely that the genotoxicity was related to solar treatment a number of studies have suggested the presence of endocrine disruptors in pet bottled water as well as most plastics using the e screen including wagner and oehlmann wagner and oehlmann 2011 and yang et al yang et al 2011 the e screen bioassay also known as the mcf 7 cell proliferation bioassay was the first in vitro bioassay developed for screening estrogenic activity it measures cellular estrogen dependent proliferation of the mcf 7 human breast cancer cell line while no mutagenicity was detected in this study levels of estrogenicity were detected in some samples in the case of the sodis process no significant levels of estrogenicity were detected for the petjc plastic following 6 h irradiation however partial estrogenicity was detected for the petcc and weak estrogenicity was detected for the pc plastic when tested for the same period of time differences in results obtained for different pet plastics has been attributed to different sources of manufacture for the plastic groh and muncke 2017 another difference between the pet plastics used in this study was the age of the plastic while the petjc plastic was new the petcc plastic while of food grade was not new andra et al found that the greatest contributor to the release of chemicals from pet and pc was the number of times the container was used andra et al 2011 in recent times interest has grown in using plastics other than pet in the sodis process fisher et al investigated the use of 1 l polycarbonate bottles fisher et al 2012b while keogh et al carried out comparative studies of the bacterial inactivation efficacy of 19 l polycarbonate water dispenser containers similar to that used in this study keogh et al 2015 in their review borde et al considered the challenges faced using large plastic bottles such as water dispensing containers made of polycarbonate in sodis studies including the fear of leaching from the plastic container into the water borde et al 2016 bisphenol a bpa is an additive used in the manufacture of pc and is a known weakly estrogenic endocrine disruptor the pc container used in this study like the petcc was also reused plastic and leaching of bpa from reusable pc drinking bottles has been previously reported kubwabo et al 2009 another distinguishing feature of the pc plastic was its blue color colorants are among the additives that can be used in plastic manufacture in nearly all cases additives are not chemically bound to the plastic polymer hahladakis et al 2018 and so could be leached under abnormal conditions furthermore no significant estrogenicity was detected for the aop processes carried out for 6 h in petjc however increases in the levels of estrogenicity were detected for the aops for both the petcc and the pc plastics we are not aware of any toxicity studies on similar aops however in their study on the effect of reactor material and its reuse on the photo fenton process varón lópez et al lópez et al 2017 found improved disinfection using photo fenton in reused pet reactors which they attributed to additional ros produced by material degradation they questioned the stability of pet after continuous exposure to a highly oxidative process such as photo fenton and suggested that toxicity testing be carried out on such systems to evaluate the safety of the water concerning the disinfection methods used the increase in estrogenicity was greater for the photo fenton process than for persulfate activation this trend mirrored the bacterial disinfection kinetics obtained under similar environmental conditions of temperature and water composition suggesting that the ho radicals had a more pronounced affect on leaching than the so 4 radicals in our study the levels of estrogenicity detected following 6 h incubation for petcc and pc were significantly higher than those detected for petjc the amount of plastic used in the tests replicated the plastic to water ratio in the original vessel suggesting that the ratio of plastic to volume of water treated also plays a role when the time of solar treatment was extended beyond the normal exposure time to seven continuous days of irradiation all three plastics showed estrogenicity the levels of estrogenicity detected were determined not to be a threat to human health nevertheless these preliminary findings indicate the need for further toxicity studies of these aops this study was designed to investigate a worst case scenario by immersing pieces of plastic in the water future studies should investigate water samples taken from operating reactors and consider the effect of varying environmental conditions including the water matrix on toxicity the study of mutagenicity and estrogenicity is very relevant when using plastic reactors for solar disinfection however detection of toxicity using these bioassays should be followed up with chemical analysis in order to identify the toxic substance and its concentration recent long term 12 months field studies in malawi of 20 l polypropylene transparent sodis buckets morse et al 2020 polo lópez et al 2019 have shown that those portions of the sodis container that remain out of contact with the water stored inside e g near the upper rim deteriorate at a faster rate than those portions of the container that remain in more sustained contact with the stored water e g nearer the base of the bucket the possibility that the risk posed from photo degradation products varies with container geometry merits further study 4 conclusions as the needs for higher quantities of safe water in rural and peri urban communities in sunny and developing countries grows the assessment of cheap large scale reactors for sodis implementation and its enhancement is a necessity from the results of this work we can draw the following conclusions sodis took place effectively in both tested materials pc or pet and the real water matrices were completely disinfected 5 log units this effect took place much earlier than the envisioned time of exposure to solar light in the field despite the water matrix constituents basic ph and organic matter presence even in a more unfavorable geographic latitude switzerland than the usual sodis applications both enhancements h2o2 and pms with or without fe2 were highly effective and halved or more the necessary exposure time to achieve complete disinfection hence the choice of the method would ultimately be affected by the reagent costs and availability in the region of application nevertheless h2o2 and photo fenton are favored in pc bottles due to the uvb portion transmitted in the reactor and pms based enhancements thrived in pet reactors where visible light was transmitted in higher proportions since the temperature was kept low 36 c in all tests the necessity to increase the temperature in order to effectively eliminate bacterial pathogens by sodis is now proven secondary however this has to be very cautiously generalized to other pathogens e g viruses cryptosporidium pending further testing generally pc was found to leach slightly more estrogenic compounds than pet also if we classify the disinfection methods in a tentative order of risk we get sodis pds photo fenton for short term testing and sodis pf pds after 1 week the difference is attributed to the type and progression of the oxidative attacks by sulfate vs hydroxyl radicals despite the apparent increase in estrogenic compounds none of the materials and none of the processes led to the generation of dangerous amounts of leachables when average daily drinking water intake was considered in addition no mutagenicity was noted although these constitute very encouraging results further testing of materials and treatment methods should be considered also if the water is destined for immediate consumption besides the materials effect the need to assess the residual effects of oxidants addition should not be overlooked in conclusion we propose that solar based enhancements should be further assessed as improvements of drinking water quality since bacteria can be eliminated and oxidative processes such as photo fenton and persulfate are known to reduce natural organic matter loads although sodis still remains the most cost effective simple and reliable technology their compatibility with methods providing larger than the typical 2 l sodis volumes

17560,solar disinfection sodis in 2 l bottles is a well established drinking water treatment technique suitable for rural peri urban or isolated communities in tropical or sub tropical climates in this work we assess the enlargement of the treatment volume by using cheap large scale plastic vessels the bactericidal performance of sodis and two solar fe2 based enhancements namely photo fenton light h2o2 fe2 and peroxymonosulfate activation light pms fe2 were assessed in 19 l polycarbonate pc and 25 l polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles in ultrapure and real water matrices tap water lake geneva water although sodis always reached total 5 logu inactivation under solar light enhancement by or both fe2 h2o2 or fe2 pms was always beneficial and led to an increase in bacterial elimination kinetics as high as 2 fold in pc and pet bottles with tap water for light h2o2 fe2 and 8 fold in pet bottles with lake geneva water the toxicological safety of the enhancements and their effects on the plastic container materials was assessed using the e screen assay and the ames test after 1 day or 1 week exposure to sodis photo fenton and persulfate activation although the production of estrogenic compounds was observed we report that no treatment method duration of exposure or material resulted in estrogenicity risk for humans and similarly no mutagenicity risk was measured in summary we suggest that sodis enhancement by either ho or so 4 based advanced oxidation process is a suitable enhancement of bacterial inactivation in large scale plastic bottles without any associated toxicity risks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords solar disinfection sodis drinking water oxidation process toxicity plastic leachables e coli 1 introduction solar disinfection sodis is a world health organization who approved intervention for the generation of safe drinking water prior to consumption its success is based on its simplicity in which a transparent container is filled with the available water and exposed to sunlight for one day under normal irradiation conditions or two days under cloudy skies mcguigan et al 2012 after this time the microbial load and especially bacterial counts are significantly lower and the water is safer to drink the interventions that have been successfully implemented all verified the acceptance of this method from the local population due to its simplicity since only a water container usually a 2 l polyethylene terephthalate pet bottle provided to the population participating in the actions heat and sunlight are involved despite its easy protocol there are several pitfalls in the application that have instigated research over the past 30 years since the first guidelines were published wegelin et al 1994 for instance solar light is comprised of uvc light which does not reach the earth s crust uvb uva visible and infrared light ir some materials used for sodis vessels e g polycarbonate or pet are partially or completely opaque to uvb wegelin et al 2001 uva is significantly less energetic than uvb sinton et al 1999 visible light is abundant but almost harmless to microorganisms and ir heats up water the corresponding mode of action of each of the wavelengths has been recently reviewed giannakis et al 2016 nelson et al 2018 briefly the main actions are uvb light acts directly on the microorganism genome mutating its genetic material oppezzo 2012 pfeifer et al 2005 uva initiates oxidative chain reactions into the cell in bacteria berney et al 2006 bosshard et al 2010a 2010b giannakis 2018 hoerter et al 2005 or matrix related oxidative processes rosado lausell et al 2013 vione et al 2010 2006 visible light in the received intensities does not contribute much hessling et al 2017 ng et al 2016 although recent reports indicate blue light mediated bacterial inactivation halstead et al 2019 maclean et al 2014 and the heat from ir light denatures proteins causing lethal damage baatout et al 2005 blaustein et al 2013 from the above description of the mode of action of sodis and its applications some obvious problems arise which researchers have attempted to resolve over the past 30 years for instance pet filters out uvb hence the efficacy of the process is reduced consequently uvb transparent materials such as pyrex bottles or polycarbonate vessels have been studied castro alférez et al 2018 fisher et al 2012a keogh et al 2015 uvb on the other hand mainly damages the genome which means that the cell may still retain a capacity to repair its damage via dark or light assisted processes and re populate the water giannakis et al 2014a vélez colmenares et al 2012 hence oxidative processes have been proposed as improvements to the sodis process byrne et al 2015 ndounla and pulgarin 2014 polo lópez et al 2018 among these processes photo fenton spuhler et al 2010 and more recently persulfate activation guerra rodríguez et al 2018 seem to be sodis compatible since they exploit the majority of the solar spectrum huang et al 2018 mosteo et al 2020 rodríguez chueca et al 2017 their reactants fe2 h2o2 are benign part of the natural photochemical cycle voelker et al 1997 or they leave harmless residual compounds so 4 2 in the case of persulfate matzek and carter 2016 the efficacy of these processes has been documented in field tests the generated oxidative species such as the ho and so 4 inactivate cells by intracellular and or extracellular disruption of their structural integrity and vital functions castro alférez et al 2016 ferreira et al 2020 giannakis et al 2018 xiao et al 2020 hence they have proven regrowth elimination capacity moncayo lasso et al 2009 ndounla et al 2013 rincón and pulgarin 2007 and since they utilize relatively cheap reagents many successful lab scale tests have been described in the literature another issue highlighted frequently in feedback from communities using sodis is that it is a labor intensive process and the low batch volume of the bottles commonly used i e 2 l pet is not well suited to family requirements since the early 2000 s there have been many studies focusing on enlarging the treated volumes by solar collector reactors of higher capacity e g 20 25 l up to 32 54 l and 88 140 l bichai et al 2012 martínez garcía et al 2020 nalwanga et al 2014 polo lópez et al 2011 reyneke et al 2020 ubomba jaswa et al 2010 and larger than the standard pet plastic bottles such as 19 l polycarbonate bottles and 5 or 20 l polypropylene buckets keogh et al 2015 polo lópez et al 2019 the apparent problems that were quickly addressed in the engineered systems cpcs were the increase of the optical path which is not beneficial for light transmission and the lower water temperatures generated in larger volumes the latter has been proven a crucial parameter in the absence of light but in abundant illumination it has a complementary synergistic character castro alférez et al 2017 giannakis et al 2014b mcguigan et al 1998 concerning the larger vessels a vast series of materials pvc pmma pet pc and others has recently been investigated on their light transmittance garcía gil et al 2020a more specifically aspects such as the wall thickness and wavelength dependent light extinction have been examined because they ultimately affect the time required for total inactivation of bacteria exposing water in plastic reactors to intense conditions of heat and light raises questions regarding the formation of photoproducts and the migration of compounds from the containers into the water which might be harmful to the consumer food contact materials are regulated by european regulation no 1935 2004 european commission 2004 which states that material in contact with food which also includes drinking water should not transfer its constituents to the food in quantities that could incur a risk to human health the more recent european regulation no 10 2011 european commission 2011 specifically covers plastic food contact materials fcm and lists the compounds authorized for use in their manufacture however while intentionally added substances in plastics may be safe for the consumer non intentionally added substances nias in the final plastic material can be toxic to the consumer bach et al 2013 in vitro bioassays such as the ames test and the e screen assay offer robust and economic solutions to screen for toxicity of fcm groh and muncke 2017 a limited number of toxicity studies have been carried out on the sodis process the ames test has been used to test pet bottled water in sodis like conditions de fusco et al 1990 monarca et al 1994 ubomba jaswa et al 2010 however there are no reports of toxicity testing for advanced oxidative processes furthermore studies to date have focused on pet plastic and so it was of interest to investigate toxicity associated with the advanced oxidative processes photo fenton and persulfate activation using pet and other plastics the present study aims to fill the knowledge gap concerning the suitability of large volume plastic containers as sodis or solar assisted aops reactors and the safety of these materials in this regard for this purpose we have assessed two large volume vessels for their suitability as sodis and solar assisted oxidative processes reactors for water treatment in the field more specifically a standard blue tinted 19 l polycarbonate pc water dispenser bottle and a 25 l polyethylene terephthalate pet jerrycan have been subjected to conditions of solar

ireland 2 2 water matrices in order to assess the differences and effects of water components on bacterial disinfection the tests took place in distilled water di tap water without further pretreatment or chloride removal and lake geneva water from the nearby pumping station of st sulpice lausanne switzerland the main physicochemical characteristics of the water matrices are summarized in table 1 obtained from own measurements and the lausanne water services 2 3 bacterial preparation and enumeration methods the e coli k12 wildtype strain was originally obtained from the german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures dsmz strain no 498 and stored in 20 glycerol at 20 c the preparation method was previously published in detail giannakis et al 2013 marjanovic et al 2018 briefly one colony from a pre culture was inoculated in 5 ml of sterilized luria bertani lb broth 10 g l bacto tryptone 10 g l nacl and 5 g l nacl the dispersion was incubated at 37 c under shaking at 180 rpm for 8 h afterwards 1 dilution was performed in lb and the solution was further incubated for 15 h under the same conditions e coli were separated from the medium by centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 15 min at 4 c followed by a rinsing step with a sterile saline solution 8 g l nacl and 0 8 g l kcl the process was repeated three times for 5 min under the same conditions the bacterial pellet was finally suspended in 25 ml of saline solution the concentration of the resulting bacterial stock was 109 colony forming units per ml cfu ml the initial concentration of 105 cfu ml which was used throughout the disinfection experiments was obtained by dilution and was estimated by the standard plate count method on non selective plate count agar pca pca plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 c followed by manual colony counting 2 4 plastics used in the study three types of plastic containers were used in the study polyethylene terephthalate pet from a 25 l transparent container which we used as jerrycan petjc pet from a 500 ml coca cola bottle petcc and blue polycarbonate pc from a 19 l container used in a water dispenser see table 2 for more information prior to the disinfection tests the used coca cola bottles were washed with ethanol warm water with soap and rinsed multiple times with di water after the disinfection tests and prior to toxicity testing the pieces of plastic were cleaned with 70 ethanol rinsed with di water and cut into small pieces of 4 4mm2 2 5 experimental strategy of disinfection tests and toxicity assays the objective of the study was to study the solar assisted bacterial disinfection in large volume reactors the disinfection tests took place in the pet jerrycans and blue pc bottles the disinfection capacity of solar light photo fenton and solar fe2 activated peroxymonosulfate were assessed in di water blank tap water real matrix in absence of organic matter and lake geneva water real water matrix with organic matter solar disinfection no additives solar light h2o2 photo fenton solar light h2o2 fe2 solar light pms and double pms activation solar light pms fe2 were assessed for their bactericidal efficacy sodis hv is considered the baseline process the hv h2o2 and photo fenton processes are the ho producing group of aops while hv pms and hv pms fe2 are producing both ho and so 4 for the assessment of the toxicological safety of the plastic materials a battery of tests was applied after disinfection to achieve reproducible results in the most unfavorable conditions the plastics were cut and the migrating substances toxicity was separately evaluated to ensure a benchmark comparison with the new food approved pet jerrycan petjc another already food approved pet material was used pet from coca cola bottles petcc the plastic bottles were cut in pieces and the respective amounts of material were submerged in 1 l of milli q mq water in a borosilicate glass vessel petjc 8 3 g petcc 15 g and polycarbonate pc 14 5 g the quantities of plastic used corresponded to the internal surface exposed for each original container from which the plastic would leach into the water divided by the quantity of water treated by the vessel the use of mq water prevented any interference from the water matrix and the use of borosilicate glass vessel any further leachables generation for the toxicity tests solar light photo fenton and pds activation instead of pms by solar light and fe2 were assessed pms activation leads to hydroxyl and sulfate radicals generation hence in order to dissociate the effects of so 4 pds was used as a precursor to avoid simultaneous ho generation by the oxidant and have only the possibility of its partial generation from side reactions so 4 reaction with ho 2 6 solar based treatment methods used

mixture of equal proportions of the ames ii ta7001 ta7006 strains to detect base pair substitutions freshly prepared overnight cultures of ta98 and tamix were exposed to the test sample as well as to a positive and negative control for 90 min in exposure medium containing sufficient histidine to support a few cell divisions after 90 min exposure cultures were diluted in ph indicator medium lacking histidine and aliquoted into 48 wells of a 384 well plate within 2 days cells that had undergone the reversion to histidine prototrophy either spontaneously or as a result of the exposure to a mutagen grew into colonies bacterial metabolism reduces the ph of the medium changing the color of that well from purple to yellow the number of wells containing revertant colonies was counted for each sample

under sodis and oxidative methods figs 1 4 summarize the disinfection experiments that took place in the two large scale bottles namely the 19 l blue polycarbonate bottle and the 25 l polyethylene terephthalate jerrycan hereon pc and pet respectively since the bacterial inactivation mechanisms of sodis hv h2o2 hv h2o2 fe2 photo fenton hv pms and hv pms fe2 have been previously discussed in the introduction section interested readers should refer to s giannakis et al 2016 marjanovic et al 2018 rodríguez chueca et al 2019 xiao et al 2019 here we will not extensively discuss the pathways to inactivation but will focus only on the main driving forces under the given conditions and the new propositions due to the changes in the container material and the water matrix in which the experiments took place 3 1 1 19 l pc bottle with di water fig 1 showcases the experiments that took place in pc bottle in di water solar disinfection hv alone attained total 5 logu bacterial inactivation within a reasonable timeframe 90 min given the moderate ambient temperatures the kinetics resemble the typical log linear inactivation after a lag period our results are in accordance with the ones of keogh et al keogh et al 2015 where total inactivation of 6 log e coli was attained in 2 h in spain in similar reactors same material volume color and thickness sodis inactivates bacteria mainly via the solar light uv and visible wavelengths optical pathways and heat thermal pathway the temperature during experimentation never surpassed 32 c which is not expected to inactivate bacteria on the contrary it is close to the optimal temperature for the survival of the mesophilic e coli 37 c giannakis et al 2014b hence inactivation is attributed solely to the light mediated pathways similarly to keogh et al keogh et al 2015 the pc reactor permits the transmittance of the uv part in the uvb region of 290 320 nm which has significant germicidal capacity and the uva region 320 400 nm which initiates a lethal intracellular cascade of oxidation events in bacteria transmittance of pc see fig s2 however the transmittance reaches a plateau around 55 for the visible light although visible light has limited effect in the direct e coli inactivation its participation is crucial in the other processes to be discussed at later stage addition of h2o2 in the water bulk enhanced e coli inactivation 26 because it initiates two parallel disinfection events i the extracellular oxidation and ii after the passage of h2o2 into the cell the enhancement of the oxidative events initiated by uvb and uva light the simultaneous presence of h2o2 and fe2 induces the generation of hydroxyl radicals in the bulk and into the cell via the fenton process hence the observed enhancement of e coli inactivation compared to sodis 116 fe3 precipitates in near neutral ph hence the photo fenton is driven by colloidal iron forms iron oxides and water bound ligands farinelli et al 2020 which considering the different kinetics of heterogeneous processes against the homogeneous ones explain the short delay shown the addition of pms into the water bulk enhanced sodis 47 initiating the oxidation of e coli similarly to previous works rodríguez chueca et al 2019 2017 in the pc reactor we attain an activation of the pms to generate hydroxyl and sulfate radicals via the homolysis of the oo bond although only uvc light was believed to activate the peroxide bond recently uvb and uva irradiation have shown to be able to activate pds and h2o2 and initiate the generation of radicals huang et al 2018 in fact in pms this process should be easier due to the asymmetric structure of the precursor molecule when compared with pds flanagan et al 1984 addition of fe2 will initiate another pathway the metal induced pms activation with fe2 oxidation to fe3 however pms has been proven to reduce fe3 to fe2 allowing its further activation with the simultaneous production of so 5 radical which is considered to have germicidal capacities rodríguez chueca et al 2019 hence the consecutive addition of pms and pms fe2 under solar light induces an increase in the inactivation kinetics 177 a summary of the kinetics from which the improvement was calculated is presented in table 3 3 1 2 19 l pc bottle with tap water fig 2 summarizes the experiments that took place in the same reactor but in tap water instead of di water firstly similar temperature profiles between the days of experimentation in di and tap water are reported hence there are no differences in thermal induced effects e g light thermal synergy castro alférez et al 2017 mcguigan et al 1998 or pms activation rodríguez chueca et al 2019 table 1 of the materials and methods details the differences among the two matrices with the two most significant being the alkaline ph of tap water 8 15 the presence of ions and a small absorbance in the far uvb region under solar light the ph does not significantly influence bacterial inactivation but the presence of ions eases the osmotic pressure that e coli suffer in their absence in di water also some of the ions contained the water have a small light absorbance rommozzi et al 2020 hence the little difference in the uv vis absorption spectra between di and tap water fig s3 these two actions lead to a 50 decrease in disinfection kinetics in tap water the changes in ph and the presence of ions have a more significant influence in the radical based processes more specifically all processes are hindered significantly by the changes in the matrix except h2o2 13 its main action mode after diffusion into the cell does not get highly affected h2o2 is an uncharged compound and the change of the overall e coli charge at the new ph isoelectric point of e coli 4 likely 2 5 hairden and harris 1953 rijnaarts et al 1995 does not hinder its passing into the cell however the addition of fe2 and the induction of the photo fenton process is significantly affected 68 although the photo fenton process eventually inactivates e coli 45 faster than sodis we observe that the kinetics are slower than the absence of fe2 as it can be seen in figure s4 the addition of fe2 in tap water leads to a rapid oxidation and a yellow tint in water from the beginning of the experiment hence the slow plateau like performance of the photo fenton process the delay of the process can be attributed to the light attenuation of the precipitated iron garcía gil et al 2020b a similar problem was encountered in another study with the same tap water pulgarin et al 2020 and the use of citrate was employed as an iron chelator to prevent its rapid precipitation also scavenging of ho is expected c l hco 3 and no 3 react with ho to generate cl co 3 and no 3 radicals which are less oxidative than ho hence less germicidal while sulfates scavenging does not lead to reactive radicals at this ph rommozzi et al 2020 the hv pms process is also affected by the change in ph 66 the reasons between this delay are most likely i the difficulty to come in contact with e coli and induce extracellular oxidation e coli are now more negative and hso 5 is an anion ii the ineffective reaction of pms with water components e g with cl that generates less oxidative radicals iii and the shift from a so 4 to a more ho dominated inactivation process liu et al 2015 due to the high presence of oh all possibilities are corroborated by the higher reduction in the efficacy of hv pms than the respective hv h2o2 process also especially in the case where pms is activated by fe the same optical reasons that delayed photo fenton also apply here leading to an 83 kinetics reduction compared to the di water experiments furthermore the so 4 generated is less scavenged by water matrix ions than ho wang et al 2020 hence the hv fe2 activation of pms results in basic ph results in slower kinetics than the hv pms process despite the possibility of pms to reduce fe the generation of so 5 is also not the most effective way to inactivate e coli we should note here that in terms of inactivation kinetics the h2o2 based processes enhanced sodis more than the pms ones for the selected amounts of fe h2o2 and pms more specifically the benefit of adding h2o2 or h2o2 fe2 in the sodis process is 130 and 45 respectively while for the pms and pms fe2 additions the increase in pc and tap water is negligible 8 and 5 hence the h2o2 based processes seem to be better enhanced in pc bottles 3 1 3 25 l pet jerrycan with tap water fig 3 details the experiments that took place in the 25 l pet jerrycan and the point of comparison is the plastics used in the reactor i e we will not repeat the ion related issues discussed in fig 2 the first difference is the slightly higher volume of the pet jerrycan 25 vs 19 l but the optical pathway of the two reactors is relatively close so we do not consider it a key aspect the bottles differences were summarized in table 2 also we can factor out any temperature influence due to the consistency of the weather during the days of experimentation the inactivation kinetics of sodis alone were very similar in the two types of reactor in the pet bottle almost the same dose was necessary to achieve 5 logu reduction of the bacterial load compared to the pc reactor only 6 faster in pc in our opinion this fact is actually a coincidence considering the big differences in the reactor color thickness and consequently the transmission in the water bulk firstly pc does allow some uvb to get transmitted into the water bulk but pet effectively blocks all wavelengths below 320 nm 0 8 transmittance at 319 nm 1 95 at 320 nm see fig s2 moreover it has been recently calculated that the thickness and the material can greatly influence the outcome of the disinfection process garcía gil et al 2020a between a pc bottle with 2 mm thickness and a pet one with 0 5 the pet shows more than 25 higher uv vis transmittance our material is 1 5 mm thick but has a blue tint so this range of reported difference is not far from our case hence we have to consider a complete shift in the underlying inactivation mechanisms induced by light alone in pc uvb acts at dna level and uva induces the intracellular photo fenton process but in pet bottles the former is not active at all however the uva levels transmitted in the pet jerrycan are significantly higher than the pc and most likely compensate the loss of the highly energetic uvb photons by the ample transmittance of the uva ones these results cannot be scaled with the ones by keogh et al keogh et al 2015 since a 2 l pet bottle was used there but the transmittance of the jerrycan is comparable with the standard sodis bottle if not a little higher fig s2 hence the material is an excellent choice for sodis no worse than the pc tested before by keogh et al keogh et al 2015 the transparent color of the pet jerrycan and its smaller thickness allows significantly higher light transmittance in the pet reactor in the uva vis region this fact affects the performance of some of the oxidative processes more specifically the hv h2o2 process is mildly affected 4 logu instead of 5 logu reduction in 1000 wh m2 16 due to this shift the reason is that pet does not allow uvb transmittance which still has a small capacity of homolytic disruption of h2o2 to generate ho hence the experiments in pet lose this pathway compared to pc due to the tenfold drop of the homolytic quantum yield between uvb and uva zuo and hoigne 1992 nevertheless the much higher uva vis light transmitted in presence of h2o2 allows the intracellular photo fenton to take place and compensate the loss of the extracellular pathway hence the overall efficacy remains the same the photo fenton process itself is now not hampered 24 kinetics increase since the pet allows higher uva transmittance that initiates the intracellular events but also an important difference in visible light which also affects e coli mosteo et al 2020 and assists in iron recycling increasing the small extent that it takes place intracellular events lmct in the bacterial cell wall giannakis et al 2018 the hv pms process is highly benefited from the change in material 118 increase in kinetics as a matter of fact almost half the energy is required to inactivate 5 logu of e coli the explanation behind this change lies within the photo activity of pms in the uv vis range fig s5 depicts the molar absorption coefficient of h2o2 and pms where significantly higher values are observed for the latter as such we postulate that uva and vis light can effectively activate pms being the only wavelengths that are transmitted in the reactor furthermore although the pet does not permit uvb the significantly higher uva and visible light transmitted over compensate its loss uva and visible light have been previously proved to synergistically inactivate e coli rodríguez chueca et al 2019 and is verified here as well the addition of fe2 similarly to the photo fenton process although it reduces the efficacy of the hv pms process the difference is now much lower with hv pms most likely due to the fe3 pms activity reported in literature fe3 under uva vis has been found to enhance pms mediated degradation of contaminants hasan et al 2020 also almost half the required energy is required for the total e coli inactivation in the pet jerrycan compared to the pc bottle 114 increase in kinetics the iron related mechanisms are functioning in a higher degree than the pc bottle hence the overall decrease in solar energy dose hence the pet at these dimensions and thickness despite the loss of the uvb photons is deemed a good alternative material for both sodis and oxidative processes it is noteworthy that for the selected amounts of fe h2o2 and pms the addition of h2o2 and h2o2 fe2 in the sodis process resulted in 106 and 93 increase in tap water in the pet jerrycan while 152 and 140 were the corresponding pms and pms fe2 increases in kinetics compared to sodis there is no doubt that the addition of at least the oxidant greatly impacts the inactivation kinetics also compared with the levels of enhancement noted in the pc bottle reactor 130 45 8 5 the h2o2 ones performed similarly slightly better but the pms processes effectiveness increased dramatically as such one may attribute h2o2 based enhancements in pc reactors which allow more uvb while pms based enhancements should be preferred in pet reactors 3 1 4 25 l pet jerrycan with lake geneva water finally fig 4 summarizes the solar based experiments that took place in the pet jerrycan but in lake geneva water the main difference is the change of matrix hence the pathways under question are the changes inflicted by the slightly higher ph 8 3 instead of 8 15 the ions compared to tap water and not the uv vis transmittance of the material sodis took place effectively but was significantly delayed compared to the tap water experiments in these experiments a max difference of 3 c was observed but since it is way below the germicidal threshold or the threshold to activate pms 40 c rodríguez chueca et al 2019 we do not consider this as an influential factor the main characteristic that differed among the experiments with tap water and lake water was the organic matter content although dom has been long recognized as a source of bactericidal ros and transient species kohantorabi et al 2019 vione et al 2014 the dominant effect of its presence is the light filter ng et al 2014 most likely the absence of the uvb irradiation due to the pet is of key influence for the generation of transient species serna galvis et al 2018 the hv h2o2 process was severely hampered in lake water besides the already discussed loss of ho due to the lack of uvb irradiation the small amount of ho generated is diminished by the inner filter effect of dom and the ho are most likely being scavenged by the dom itself as a target vione et al 2006 the addition of fe2 has a detrimental effect on the efficacy on the process although more uva is available in pet the lake water shows a higher absorbance after the addition of fe most likely via its complexation by dom and the generation of photo active complexes fig s3 in some works these complexes have been expected to contribute to maintaining the iron in solution and assist the photo fenton process giannakis et al 2016 porras et al 2018 rodríguez chueca et al 2014 and indeed this may happen here in a small extent nevertheless the possible higher ho generation is scavenged by dom as shown by the different spectra of tap and lake water fig s3 surprisingly the hv pms process was not as scavenged as the hv h2o2 process this means that the activation of pms by light although smaller hence slower kinetics continued to generate ho and so 4 considering that so 4 reacts much more slowly with dom compared to ho this explains why this process could maintain a high bactericidal efficacy the addition of fe2 was once again found to be detrimental to the hv pms efficacy but not high enough to hinder the solar initiated pathways hence the pms assisted processes are more effective than the respective h2o2 ones in natural waters if one compares the kinetics of sodis with the attained by the h2o2 based processes 231 and 141 increase or with the pms based processes 715 and 538 increase for the selected amounts of fe h2o2 and pms the importance of enhancing sodis with either process h2o2 or pms based is more than obvious what is more important is that the pms based processes led to even higher enhancements hence their superiority in pet reactors with natural waters is verified 3 1 5 significance of the disinfection findings as a provisional conclusion similarly to keogh et al and garcia gil et al garcía gil et al 2020a keogh et al 2015 we can verify that both the 19 l pc water cooler bottles and the 25 l pet jerrycans are good candidates for sodis containers but also our new results prove that they are suitable vectors for solar based advanced oxidation processes based on either ho and so 4 the differences between material properties lead to changes in the pathways of bacterial inactivation but both materials ensured total inactivation in less than 3 4 h in any matrix in compliance with the 1 day exposure necessities of sodis even at high volumes and at modest temperatures also the addition of oxidants h2o2 pms and fe2 all enhanced sodis the studied oxidative processes were more effective than sodis hence the beneficial impact of ho and so 4 cannot be doubted despite the generally unfavorable conditions namely i high ph in our matrices alkaline ph ii the subsequent precipitation of iron and the possible deposition on the wall of the reactors which may result in lower light penetration iii the passive convectional mixing only due to temperature gradients and iv the heterogeneous catalytic pathways the processes were found to be suitable and effective in reducing the bacterial load however before any conclusive recommendation can be made regarding the suitability of the process and the material selection the effect of each process on the material must be assessed 3 2 toxicity assays plastic leachables 3 2 1 proliferative effects of leachables following 6 h of irradiation the proliferative effects of migrating substances from petjc petcc and blue pc plastic polymers following 6 h of irradiation with sodis photo fenton and persulfate activation hv pds fe2 reactions are described in fig 5 in order to isolate the effects of plastic from other potential sources of contamination ultrapure mq water was used and pds as an exclusive sulfate radical generator was employed instead of pms the e screen assay was carried out in the presence and absence of ici 182 780 an estrogen receptor antagonist to confirm whether any chemicals released under sodis photo fenton and pds activation processes were estrogenic following 6 h irradiation no significant estrogenic activity was detected for petjc pieces for any of the treatments fig 5 calculated relative proliferative effect rpe values of migrating substances from petjc were around 5 for the photo fenton treatment 7 for the pds activation and 18 for sodis table 4 these rpe values indicated that petjc samples were very weak or non existent agonists of estradiol and were therefore not estrogenic on the other hand evidence of estrogenic activity was apparent in migrating substances from petcc following 6 h irradiation relative to the negative control petcc stimulated growth by 153 20 following sodis 239 32 following photo fenton conditions and by 184 23 following a pds activation process fig 5 the data show an increase of approximately 31 86 in proliferation when sodis irradiation treatment was enhanced these proliferative effects translate to rpe of 76 for photo fenton treatment 67 for pds activation treatment and around 43 for sodis table 4 these results suggest that substances released from petcc act as partial agonists of the estradiol receptor migrating substances from the pc bottle stimulated growth by 151 42 following sodis for 6 h fig 5 however this was not significantly different from the negative control substances released from pc after 6 h photo fenton and pds activation reactions stimulated proliferation by 190 29 and by 164 4 respectively the substances migrating from pc after 6 h of photo fenton irradiation treatment had rpe of approximately 81 which implies that these released substances act as partial total agonists of the estradiol receptor table 4 on the other hand substances migrating from pc after 6 h of pds activation triggered an rpe of 49 which suggests they are weak partial agonists of the estradiol receptor table 4 3 2 2 proliferative effects of leachables following 7 days of irradiation evidence of time dependent estrogenic activity of chemicals released from petjc after 1 week of irradiation was shown relative to the negative control petjc leachates after 1 week of sodis stimulated growth by 210 21 interestingly no further increase in proliferation was observed when sodis was enhanced the substances released after 1 week under photo fenton irradiation and pds activation stimulated proliferation by 216 18 and by 244 36 respectively fig 6 the rpe values of the leachates from petjc polymer after 1 week under irradiation treatment were 80 which indicated a strong estradiol agonistic effect of the samples table 4 also important to note here is that prolonged irradiation of petcc for a week did not significantly enhance estrogenic activity when compared to the levels of estrogenicity detected following 6 h irradiation of the samples however enhanced sodis conditions with petcc led to a 41 43 increase in proliferation estrogenic activity of migrating chemicals from petcc released after 1 week under sodis photo fenton and pds activation conditions were 139 7 180 26 and 182 23 respectively relative to the control fig 6 rpe values between approximately 33 67 indicate that the leachates released from the petcc after one week of irradiation treatment act as partial agonists of the estradiol receptor evidence of time dependent estrogenic activity was also apparent in pc leachables prolonged irradiation of pc over the course of 1 week enhanced estrogenic activity when compared to the estrogenic activity of the samples irradiated for 6 h estrogenic activity of released substances from blue pc under sodis photo fenton and pds activation were 216 21 221 21 and 238 7 respectively relative to the control fig 6 the rpe values of the pc irradiated for 1 week were 80 table 4 meaning that they are strong estradiol agonists moreover pc leachates from advanced oxidative processes were above 100 indicating an estrogenic affect more potent than the one exerted by the positive control estradiol co incubation of all leachates with ici had a negligible effect on growth compared with the negative control confirming the presence of estrogenic leachables see fig 6 3 2 3 estradiol equivalents eeqs estradiol equivalent values eeqs were calculated for all leachates that showed an increased proliferative effect to benchmark water in terms of acceptable daily intake limit of β estradiol set by jecfa 2000 table 4 eeq values calculated from the dose response curve of 17β estradiol were corrected for the concentration factor used since water samples were concentrated 10 000 fold via spe and diluted 100 fold in the e screen the final concentration factor for every sample was 100 derived eeqs were reported as ng l the values calculated ranged from 0 008 5 9 ng l following 6 h irradiation the eeq values for the samples from the blue polycarbonate polymer pc were in the order of 0 03 0 57 ng l and were the highest values obtained for all three plastics eeq values for the petjc samples were 103 to 106 times lower than 1 ng l while the eeq values for petcc samples were greater than the values for the petjc and were in the order of 0 03 0 42 ng l following 1 week of irradiation the eeq values for the pc samples were in the order of 1 3 5 9 ng l and were again the highest values obtained for all three plastics for that period of irradiation eeq values of the petjc samples were in the order of 0 6 1 5 ng l while the eeq values for petcc samples were in the order of 0 008 0 2 ng l and unlike following 6 h of irradiation were lower than the values obtained for the petjc assuming a 3 5 kg baby consumes 0 52 l water through breast milk the daily consumption of estradiol from the pds irradiated water sample having the highest eeq value would be 0 9 ng kg of body weight the corresponding value for an adult of 65 kg that drinks 2 l of water per day would be 0 2 ng kg of body weight all values calculated were within the adi range 0 50 ng kg body weight of estradiol recommended by the jecfa world health organization 2006 3 2 4 mutagenicity of leachables no mutagenicity was detected for any sample when tested using the ames test as no value obtained showed a clear fold induction 2 above the baseline value table 5 3 2 5 significance of the toxicological findings known substances and unknown nias can migrate from plastics in contact with water and so testing the overall migrate using in vitro tests offers a pragmatic and cost effective approach to toxicity testing in vitro toxicity testing performed with fcms has focused on 3 main types of toxicity namely cytotoxicity genotoxicity and endocrine activity groh and muncke 2017 in this study genotoxicity was tested using the ames test and endocrine activity was determined using the e screen assay the study by de fusco et al in 1990 was among the earliest investigations for the presence of toxins in bottled water de fusco et al 1990 they studied the leaching of mutagens into mineral water from pet bottles using the ames test following short and long term storage in light and dark the results identified leaching of mutagens after 1 month of storage but not after 3 or 6 months of storage the mutagenic activity detected in the water stored for 1 month in pet was higher after storage in daylight compared with storage in the dark since then a number of similar studies have been carried out bach et al 2014 2013 monarca et al 1994 ubomba jaswa et al 2010 as was the case in this study no mutagenicity was reported in any of these studies with the exception of that by ubomba jaswa et al ubomba jaswa et al 2010 however in their study while genotoxicity was detected after 2 months in water stored in pet bottles and exposed continuously without refilling to sunlight toxicity was also detected in pet bottles stored in the dark after 2 months making it unlikely that the genotoxicity was related to solar treatment a number of studies have suggested the presence of endocrine disruptors in pet bottled water as well as most plastics using the e screen including wagner and oehlmann wagner and oehlmann 2011 and yang et al yang et al 2011 the e screen bioassay also known as the mcf 7 cell proliferation bioassay was the first in vitro bioassay developed for screening estrogenic activity it measures cellular estrogen dependent proliferation of the mcf 7 human breast cancer cell line while no mutagenicity was detected in this study levels of estrogenicity were detected in some samples in the case of the sodis process no significant levels of estrogenicity were detected for the petjc plastic following 6 h irradiation however partial estrogenicity was detected for the petcc and weak estrogenicity was detected for the pc plastic when tested for the same period of time differences in results obtained for different pet plastics has been attributed to different sources of manufacture for the plastic groh and muncke 2017 another difference between the pet plastics used in this study was the age of the plastic while the petjc plastic was new the petcc plastic while of food grade was not new andra et al found that the greatest contributor to the release of chemicals from pet and pc was the number of times the container was used andra et al 2011 in recent times interest has grown in using plastics other than pet in the sodis process fisher et al investigated the use of 1 l polycarbonate bottles fisher et al 2012b while keogh et al carried out comparative studies of the bacterial inactivation efficacy of 19 l polycarbonate water dispenser containers similar to that used in this study keogh et al 2015 in their review borde et al considered the challenges faced using large plastic bottles such as water dispensing containers made of polycarbonate in sodis studies including the fear of leaching from the plastic container into the water borde et al 2016 bisphenol a bpa is an additive used in the manufacture of pc and is a known weakly estrogenic endocrine disruptor the pc container used in this study like the petcc was also reused plastic and leaching of bpa from reusable pc drinking bottles has been previously reported kubwabo et al 2009 another distinguishing feature of the pc plastic was its blue color colorants are among the additives that can be used in plastic manufacture in nearly all cases additives are not chemically bound to the plastic polymer hahladakis et al 2018 and so could be leached under abnormal conditions furthermore no significant estrogenicity was detected for the aop processes carried out for 6 h in petjc however increases in the levels of estrogenicity were detected for the aops for both the petcc and the pc plastics we are not aware of any toxicity studies on similar aops however in their study on the effect of reactor material and its reuse on the photo fenton process varón lópez et al lópez et al 2017 found improved disinfection using photo fenton in reused pet reactors which they attributed to additional ros produced by material degradation they questioned the stability of pet after continuous exposure to a highly oxidative process such as photo fenton and suggested that toxicity testing be carried out on such systems to evaluate the safety of the water concerning the disinfection methods used the increase in estrogenicity was greater for the photo fenton process than for persulfate activation this trend mirrored the bacterial disinfection kinetics obtained under similar environmental conditions of temperature and water composition suggesting that the ho radicals had a more pronounced affect on leaching than the so 4 radicals in our study the levels of estrogenicity detected following 6 h incubation for petcc and pc were significantly higher than those detected for petjc the amount of plastic used in the tests replicated the plastic to water ratio in the original vessel suggesting that the ratio of plastic to volume of water treated also plays a role when the time of solar treatment was extended beyond the normal exposure time to seven continuous days of irradiation all three plastics showed estrogenicity the levels of estrogenicity detected were determined not to be a threat to human health nevertheless these preliminary findings indicate the need for further toxicity studies of these aops this study was designed to investigate a worst case scenario by immersing pieces of plastic in the water future studies should investigate water samples taken from operating reactors and consider the effect of varying environmental conditions including the water matrix on toxicity the study of mutagenicity and estrogenicity is very relevant when using plastic reactors for solar disinfection however detection of toxicity using these bioassays should be followed up with chemical analysis in order to identify the toxic substance and its concentration recent long term 12 months field studies in malawi of 20 l polypropylene transparent sodis buckets morse et al 2020 polo lópez et al 2019 have shown that those portions of the sodis container that remain out of contact with the water stored inside e g near the upper rim deteriorate at a faster rate than those portions of the container that remain in more sustained contact with the stored water e g nearer the base of the bucket the possibility that the risk posed from photo degradation products varies with container geometry merits further study 4 conclusions as the needs for higher quantities of safe water in rural and peri urban communities in sunny and developing countries grows the assessment of cheap large scale reactors for sodis implementation and its enhancement is a necessity from the results of this work we can draw the following conclusions sodis took place effectively in both tested materials pc or pet and the real water matrices were completely disinfected 5 log units this effect took place much earlier than the envisioned time of exposure to solar light in the field despite the water matrix constituents basic ph and organic matter presence even in a more unfavorable geographic latitude switzerland than the usual sodis applications both enhancements h2o2 and pms with or without fe2 were highly effective and halved or more the necessary exposure time to achieve complete disinfection hence the choice of the method would ultimately be affected by the reagent costs and availability in the region of application nevertheless h2o2 and photo fenton are favored in pc bottles due to the uvb portion transmitted in the reactor and pms based enhancements thrived in pet reactors where visible light was transmitted in higher proportions since the temperature was kept low 36 c in all tests the necessity to increase the temperature in order to effectively eliminate bacterial pathogens by sodis is now proven secondary however this has to be very cautiously generalized to other pathogens e g viruses cryptosporidium pending further testing generally pc was found to leach slightly more estrogenic compounds than pet also if we classify the disinfection methods in a tentative order of risk we get sodis pds photo fenton for short term testing and sodis pf pds after 1 week the difference is attributed to the type and progression of the oxidative attacks by sulfate vs hydroxyl radicals despite the apparent increase in estrogenic compounds none of the materials and none of the processes led to the generation of dangerous amounts of leachables when average daily drinking water intake was considered in addition no mutagenicity was noted although these constitute very encouraging results further testing of materials and treatment methods should be considered also if the water is destined for immediate consumption besides the materials effect the need to assess the residual effects of oxidants addition should not be overlooked in conclusion we propose that solar based enhancements should be further assessed as improvements of drinking water quality since bacteria can be eliminated and oxidative processes such as photo fenton and persulfate are known to reduce natural organic matter loads although sodis still remains the most cost effective simple and reliable technology their compatibility with methods providing larger than the typical 2 l sodis volumes

17561,conventional wastewater treatment lacks the ability to remove many pharmaceuticals this is leading to emissions to the natural aquatic environment where these compounds pose a risk to the aquatic organisms an advanced wastewater treatment technique that has shown promising results is moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr initial degradation velocity and degradation rate constants of the pharmaceuticals are important parameters for designing an optimal mbbr system however the degradation efficiency varies across studies and one of the most plausible causes might be initial concentration thus to verify the effect of initial concentration the degradation of a mixture of 18 pharmaceuticals at different initial concentrations was studied for this study mbbr s with very low bod loading were used as they were conditioned with effluent water the experiment was set up as a mbbr batch incubation using effluent wastewater as medium spiked with the 18 pharmaceuticals in seven different concentration levels approximately 0 300 µg l 1 the degradation of 14 out of 18 pharmaceuticals was concentration dependent the initial degradation velocity of the pharmaceuticals was either proportional to the initial concentration or was following a typical michaelis menten kinetic the degradation velocity of one compound i e sulfamethizole might have been inhibited at high concentrations the degradation rate constants from single first order fittings ksfo for some compounds deviated from the expected behavior at low concentrations below 10 µg l 1 this is suggested to be caused by simplicity of the michaelis menten model not taking possible occurrence of co metabolism and mass transfer limitations into account at low concentrations this study underlines the fact that k values cannot be interpreted without paying attention to the tested concentration level furthermore it shows that the used mbbrs was able to handle high concentrations of pharmaceuticals and that the most efficient removal occurs at concentrations above 100 µg l 1 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords moving bed biofilm reactor michaelis menten kinetics wastewater treatment plant effluent organic micropollutants pharmaceuticals 1 introduction pharmaceuticals are present in many different water bodies boulard et al 2020 hermes et al 2018 nantaba et al 2020 yang et al 2017 where they can cause adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems bruce et al 2010 farré et al 2008 gabet giraud et al 2014 osorio et al 2016 the pharmaceuticals can even reach the drinking water supplies at concentrations of ng l 1 if this is produced from surface water padhye et al 2014 snyder 2008 however the knowledge about the consequences on human health of long term exposure is still very limited boxall et al 2012 ikehata et al 2008 the pharmaceuticals mainly enter the environment via wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents daughton and ruhoy 2009 snyder et al 2003 ternes and joss 2006 vanderford et al 2003 as conventional wwtp s were not designed to remove these compounds falås et al 2012a yang et al 2017 some easily degradable pharmaceuticals such as paracetamol and ibuprofen can be removed up to 90 joss et al 2005 ternes and joss 2015 however many other pharmaceuticals are passing the conventional wwtp unchanged or only with a slight fraction removed falås et al 2012b joss et al 2005 plósz et al 2010a 2010b therefore additional treatment is required to control the release of pharmaceuticals to the receiving water and decrease the environmental impact moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs is a wastewater treatment technology that has shown promising results for removal of pharmaceuticals casas et al 2015a 2015b falås et al 2012b mbbrs contain small plastic carriers on which microorganisms grow to form a biofilm ødegaard et al 1994 these carriers with the adhered biofilm are moving in the reactor by means of a stirrer or by air bubbles during the aeration of the tank the degradation reaction kinetics and degradation mechanisms of pharmaceuticals in biological systems such as mbbrs can change depending on the initial concentration of the compound el taliawy et al 2018 hussain et al 2009 muller et al 2006 wilson 1985 this has for example been observed for mecoprop degradation in mbbrs at 10 50 and 100 µg l 1 where the degradation rate constant decreased with increasing concentration for the s enantiomer while no difference was observed for the r enantiomer escolà casas et al 2017 el taliawy et al 2018 observed significant lower degradation rate constants for some n oxides at 10 µg l 1 compared to 1 µg l 1 moreover for some n oxides the presence of a lag phase at 10 µg l 1 was observed on the other hand no significant difference was observed for mbbr degradation of diclofenac at 5 and 200 µg l 1 jewell et al 2016 a systematic study of the concentration effects on degradation velocity is needed to clarify if an overall trend exists for the role of pharmaceuticals initial concentration in their respective degradation concentration effects on degradation velocity can often follow michaelis menten kinetics the michaelis menten equation is originally developed for enzyme kinetics eq 1 johnson and goody 2011 michaelis and menten 1913 the concentration of enzymes is constant and the substrate is processed with an increasing velocity at increasing substrate concentrations while the enzymes are more saturated with increasing concentrations until the reaction velocity cannot increase any further this concentration dependent reaction velocity characterized by the michaelis menten expression has however also been observed for microbial systems in steady state e g for the microbial mediated hydrolysis of the insecticide parathion by e coli sd2 gilbert et al 2003 as well as degradation of the antibiotic tetracycline by a bacterial strain leng et al 2016 and p chlorobenzoate and chloroacetate by a microbial community from stream water boethling and alexander 1979 it is therefore reasonable to believe that michaelis menten kinetics can be used to assess concentration effects on degradation velocity of pharmaceuticals in mbbrs michaelis menten equation 1 v v m a x c k m c where v equals initial degradation velocity µg l 1 h 1 vmax is the maximum velocity µg l 1 h 1 at which all available enzyme molecules are occupied with the respective reaction km is the half saturation constant µg l 1 and c is the substrate concentration µg l 1 the reaction kinetics and the degradation rate constants of pharmaceuticals are important parameters in designing mbbr and they have to be well described in order to optimize the reactor design however if testing of the respective reaction kinetics is conducted at significantly higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals from 100 µg l 1 up to mg l 1 than the experienced in the environment often sub µg l 1 the results can possibly be misleading the objective of this study was to test whether for mbbr a michaelis menten relationship is relevant for the degradation of pharmaceuticals further if yes what would be a reasonable concentration range of pharmaceuticals in which linear equations can be used and what degradation efficiency can be expected at peak concentrations to conduct the study under realistic polishing step conditions in the present study the effect of initial pharmaceutical concentration on a degradation velocity and b degradation rate constant of the pharmaceuticals was investigated for the degradation of 18 pharmaceuticals in lab scale mbbr reactors

pharmaceutical concentrations in danish effluent wastewater are below 5 µg l 1 liang et al 2019 tang et al 2017 which is also observed for the wastewater used in this study table s2 the degradation of x ray contrast media was studied at 5x higher concentrations than the other compounds as these are usually present in wastewater at this proportionally higher concentrations than the other pharmaceuticals margot et al 2015b to prepare the incubations a stock solution of the pharmaceuticals mixture in methanol were added to each empty flask and left overnight to evaporate the methanol the reactors were covered with aluminum foil to prevent photo degradation the day succeeding the spike 75 ml of effluent wastewater from bjergmarken wwtp roskilde denmark were added to each reactor the reactors were placed on a shaker and shaken for 30 min to allow the compounds to homogenously dissolve in the water successively 10 anoxkaldnes k5 carriers anoxkaldnes lund sweden with biofilm were added to each of the reactors the time registration started and the t0 sample was taken from each reactor four erlenmeyer flasks were utilized as controls without biofilm at concentrations 0 1 30 and 300 µg l 1 ten new carriers without any biofilm were added to each of these control reactors the reactors were placed on a horizontal shaker to ensure constant mixing during the entire duration of the experiment all reactors were closed with a loose cover of aluminum foil to avoid dust contamination but allowing air to enter the reactors and keep the aerobic condition all over the experiment period no additional air was supplied to the reactors as the low bod content of the reaction medium effluent wastewater bod 4 39 2 70 mg l 1 results in a low oxygen consumption after taking 7 samples of 900 µl each from each reactor one carrier was removed to maintain the ratio between the water volume and number of carriers as constant as possible the ratio throughout the experiment was 7 5 ml

determination the biomass was determined by taking out two carriers from each reactor and drying them overnight at 105 c and then they were placed in a desiccator to cool down and successively be weighted two of the new carriers from each control reactor were treated in the same way and weighted the biomass content on the carriers was calculated as the difference in weight average between

h 1 from the first linear part of the degradation in the concentration vs time plot until 10 of the compound had been removed dt10 volatilization of the pharmaceuticals and sorption to glass or to the plastic carriers have been found to be negligible torresi et al 2016 however sorption to the biofilm was not monitored in this study implying that for cationic pharmaceuticals erythromycin clarithromycin atenolol citalopram metoprolol and venlafaxine some of the removal could potentially be due to sorption torresi et al 2017 to account for analytical errors at least three time points were used to assess the initial degradation velocity for the three compounds where dt10 was reached before the third time point dt20 or dt50 was used instead atenolol dt20 ibuprofen dt50 acetyl sulfadiazine dt50 the initial velocity was plotted against the initial concentration and fitted with either linear regression eq 2 or michaelis menten kinetics eq 1 presented in the introduction using the drc r package for analysis of dose response curves ritz et al 2015 linear regression 2 v a c where v is the initial degradation velocity µg l 1 h 1 a is the proportionality constant h 1 and c is the concentration of the respective pharmaceutical µg l 1 for selection of the best model for the data linear regression or michaelis menten kinetics the akaike information criterion aic cavanaugh and neath 2019 was calculated for each model fit aic is an ubiquitous statistical tool for model selection it estimates the relative information amount lost by the model and thereby gives a value describing quality relative to other models the model with the lower value is the best fit for the data however if the difference in aic aic is less than 10 both models show the same quality 2 5 1 degradation kinetics degradation kinetics data from the individual pharmaceuticals at the different concentration levels were fitted to single first order sfo kinetics eq 3 a with the corresponding

separately as each kinetic represents a time series of repeated measurements from the same experimental unit the model fits were evaluated with visual interpretation of residual and quantile quantile plots 2 5 2 the effect of initial concentration on the degradation rate constant the degradation rate constants derived from the sfo fits ksfo were plotted against initial concentration to test if the ksfo values for a compound were significantly different for the different concentration levels a nonlinear mixed effects model jiang and kopp schneider 2014 was used the nonlinear mixed effects model is taking the variety within and between the concentration levels into account simultaneously thus giving an estimate of which ksfo values are significantly different α 0 05 from each other 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation velocity the initial degradation velocity of 14 degradable pharmaceuticals was plotted against initial concentration shown in fig 1 for sotalol metoprolol citalopram and ibuprofen and in si figure s1 s6 for the remaining ten compounds sulfamethizole acetyl sulfadiazine trimethoprim erythromycin clarithromycin atenolol diclofenac iohexol iomeprol and iopromide the other four compounds iopamidol venlafaxine phenazone and sulfamethoxazole were not degraded at any concentration level during the 120 h incubation time and were therefore excluded from further data analysis these compounds are known to be persistent under similar conditions dt50 500 h liang et al 2019 of the 14 degradable compounds the initial degradation velocity of ten compounds followed michaelis menten kinetics examples are shown in fig 1 while four did not the initial degradation velocity of the ten compounds acetyl sulfadiazine sotalol citalopram ibuprofen erythromycin clarithromycin trimethoprim metoprolol atenolol and diclofenac followed michaelis menten kinetics four of these trimethoprim metoprolol atenolol and diclofenac showed equally good fits to linear regression as stated by a difference in aic below 10 when substrate concentrations are lower than the half saturation constant km c km initial degradation velocity often shows a linear relation with initial concentration and can be fitted with linear regression as well as michaelis menten kinetics for the compounds in this study where michaelis menten kinetics and linear regression both showed good fits table 1 the estimated km values were higher than the tested concentration range for all compounds except metoprolol thus for these compounds atenolol diclofenac citalopram the tested concentration range was below saturation for the remaining compounds an initial deflection of the curve towards saturation was observed within the tested concentration range the largest vmax values were found in the order atenolol citalopram sotalol acetyl sulfadiazine diclofenac clarithromycin ibuprofen metoprolol erythromycin trimethoprim these maximum degradation velocities were estimated to be reached at high concentrations 100 µg l 1 exceeding environmental relevant ranges up to 10 µg l 1 the order of initial degradation velocity at the more environmental relevant concentration 3 µg l 1 was ibuprofen acetyl sulfadiazine erythromycin clarithromycin atenolol citalopram metoprolol trimethoprim diclofenac sotalol this order of the compounds follows with few exceptions the degradability order shown in mbbr studies elsewhere casas et al 2015a 2015b liang et al 2019 tang et al 2017 as to the authors best knowledge no other studies on concentration effects on initial degradation velocity have been published on biofilms thus the present data can only be compared to studies with pure enzymes or suspended bacterial cultures concentration dependent degradation of pharmaceuticals using laccase enzymes have previously been shown lonappan et al 2017 margot et al 2015a 2013 diclofenac degradation at concentrations between 50 and 5000 µg l 1 followed michaelis menten kinetics for fungi produced laccase enzymes constant enzyme activity of 50 u l 1 with a vmax of 80 6 µg l 1 h 1 and km of 2675 µg l 1 lonappan et al 2017 these values are higher than the ones found in our study vmax 3 32 µg l 1 h 1 and km 462 µg l 1 however taking into account that our degradation study is with a mixed biofilm community and lonappan et al s is with pure laccase enzyme the numbers are somewhat in range laccase mediated oxidation constant enzyme activity of 450 u l 1 of sulfamethoxazole at high concentrations 13 35 mg l 1 showed a linear increase in oxidation velocity with concentration margot et al 2015a in our study sulfamethoxazole did not degrade at any tested concentration range michaelis menten kinetics have also been used to describe degradation in microbial communities gilbert et al 2003 found that parathion hydrolysis by an engineered microorganism od600nm 1 4 1 7 at five concentrations in the range of 0 583 mg l 1 followed michaelis menten and estimated the parathion half saturation constant km to be 47 mg l 1 another study investigated the degradation of tetracycline 10 200 mg l 1 by the bacterial strain stenotrophomonas maltophilia dt1 1 v v od600nm 1 solution leng et al 2016 it was found that the degradation velocity at concentrations below 100 mg l 1 followed michaelis menten kinetics with a vmax of 62 14 mg l 1d 1 and a km of 80 52 mg l 1 common for those two studies is that they both dealt with bacterial strains adapted to the studied compounds in the mg l 1 range i e under catabolic conditions in our study we show that michaelis menten kinetics also appear in the µg l 1 range of pharmaceuticals with a mixed biofilm community grown in effluent wastewater four compounds did not follow michaelis menten kinetics iohexole iomeprol iopromide and sulfamethizole iohexol iomeprol and iopromide figure s6 were fitted to both michaelis menten kinetics and linear regression however the large variations in degradation velocity resulted in very high values of vmax and km with even higher standard errors and the michaelis menten fit was therefore deemed unrealistic the initial degradation velocity of sulfamethizole appeared to follow substrate inhibition figure s3 however the substrate inhibition model showed a very poor fit thus a similar approach as in gilbert et al 2003 was followed where a linear model were plotted for the increasing part following the same approach for sulfamethizole yielded a linear model for the increasing velocity at concentrations below 40 µg l 1 table 1 the presence of human metabolites in the wastewater was not monitored however sulfamethizole is known to be excreted mainly unmetabolized with more than 80 excreted as sulfamethizole and less than 5 as acetyl sulfamethizole vree and hekster 1985 thus the presence of human metabolites of sulfamethizole is not thought to have an influence parameters from the linear regression and the michaelis menten fitting for all compounds are shown in table 1 to sum up working range with thin biofilms like the ones applied in this study gave maximum degradation velocity from 0 081 10 4 µg l 1 h 1 depending on the compound table 1 the concentration level at which the saturation started varied between the compounds as seen from the half saturation constant km 1 7 629 5 µg l 1 table 1 however for most compounds in this study concentrations up to 3 µg l 1 can be regarded as a safe level where no saturation is expected 3 2 degradation rate constants the degradation of the 14 compounds at nearly all concentration levels could be fitted to sfo kinetics the degradation of sotalol metoprolol citalopram and ibuprofen at the seven concentration levels are shown as example in fig 2 and 3 as relative concentration over time while the remaining compounds are shown in si figure s7 10 for both clarithromycin and erythromycin degradation was observed in all the control reactors without biofilm for ibuprofen some degradation was also observed in the control for the lowest control concentration 3 µg l 1 the controls consisted of effluent wastewater containing residual suspended biomass thus the degradation of clarithromycin and erythromycin as well as ibuprofen at low concentrations cannot be assigned to the biofilm alone but is a result of suspended biomass as well as biofilm this phenomenon has also been observed elsewhere liang et al 2019 the effect of initial concentration on the sfo derived degradation rate constant ksfo is depicted in fig 4 for citalopram metoprolol ibuprofen and sotalol and in si figure s11 14 for the remaining compounds ksfo values and indications of significant differences for all compounds and concentration levels as well as general sfo parameters are shown in si table s5 two different behaviors of ksfo are visible in fig 3 for ibuprofen and sotalol the ksfo values decreased as initial concentration increased while for citalopram and metoprolol there was an initial increase in the ksfo values a decrease in ksfo value with increasing concentration is the expected pattern for michaelis menten kinetics where the slope in a given point of the michaelis menten curve which corresponds to ksfo is largest at low concentrations and approaches zero when the system is saturated besides ibuprofen and sotalol the decrease in the ksfo values was also observed for trimethoprim erythromycin atenolol and diclofenac figure s11 13 the other pattern where ksfo showed an initial increase was observed for citalopram and metoprolol fig 4 as well as for sulfamethizole ac sulfadiazine clarithromycin iohexol iopromide and iomeprol figure s11 14 of these compounds only acetyl sulfadiazine clarithromycin metoprolol and citalopram could be fitted to michaelis menten kinetics the deviations in the expected ksfo behavior indicates that michaelis menten kinetics for these compounds were not fulfilled at low concentrations c 10 µg l 1 no apparent similarities in compound properties molecular mass molecular volume pka and log kow were found for these compounds additionally there was no correlation between the compound properties and km when plotted for all compounds michaelis menten kinetics was developed for one enzyme one substrate systems michaelis and menten 1913 in our case we had a mixed microbial community and therefore probably multiple active enzyme systems furthermore the degradation of the pharmaceuticals was studied simultaneously in a mixture with the presence of growth substrate in the form of recalcitrant carbon residual cod in wastewater terms present in the effluent wastewater it is therefore likely that the michaelis menten model was too simple to fit all our data another aspect is the possibility of co metabolism in which the organisms use other compounds than the observed micropollutant as main source for carbon energy and nutrients co metabolism has been shown or suggested as the main mechanism for degradation when the concentration of pharmaceuticals is low typically below 10 µg l 1 kassotaki et al 2016 müller et al 2013 nguyen et al 2019 ternes and joss 2015 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 as described in the materials and methods section the batch incubations in this study were all run on the same batch of effluent wastewater thus the bod content in the different reactors were the same around 4 mg l 1 without considering the increase originating from the spiked pharmaceuticals themselves bod consumption was not monitored the michaelis menten model is often too simple to describe co metabolism which could be an explanation for our observed deviation in ksfo behavior at low concentrations other studies have used expanded michaelis menten models that for example includes competitive inhibition between growth substrate and micropollutans chang and alvarez cohen 1995 and nad p h regeneration and cell growth decay sipkema et al 2000 the relevance of these models to our system cannot be tested as the required measurements were not planned in our experimental design another explanation for the deviation in ksfo values at low concentrations could be the presence of mass transfer limitations torresi et al 2017 it has also been shown for another micropollutant atrazine under catabolic conditions that mass transfer can be the limiting factor for biodegradation at low concentrations ehrl et al 2019 with 10 12 µg l 1 as a minimum substrate concentration sufficient for the cells energy demand kundu et al 2019 in the present study it was not possible to discriminate between the occurrence of co metabolism and mass transfer limitations as seen from our results ksfo values for a single compound can differ considerably up to a 350 or even up to 2500 for the very slow degrading compounds depending on the investigated concentration approximately 0 300 µg l 1 it is therefore important to pay attention to test concentration when interpreting ksfo values typical pharmaceutical concentrations in aquatic compartments are in the range of ng l 1 to a few µg l 1 and rarely exceeding 10 µg l 1 barbosa et al 2016 krzeminski et al 2019 thus staying below 10 µg l 1 ensures an experimental design close to the environmental situation our results also show that mbbrs can handle high concentrations of pharmaceuticals at high concentrations the percentage removal is small however the absolute removal is high making the removal more efficient than at low concentrations taking sotalol as an example we showed that the same mbbr carriers during one hour could remove 25 times as much sotalol from the 400 µg l 1 level compared to the environmental relevant 3 µg l 1 level the estimated vmax for sotalol 3 94 µg l 1 h 1 compared to the velocity at 3 µg l 1 0 07 µg l 1 h 1 show that mbbr carriers can remove 54 times more sotalol at its maximum velocity these results indicate that mbbr can be used to treat wastewater with high concentrations of pharmaceuticals for example product water from forward osmosis 4 conclusion the present study investigated the effect of initial concentration of 18 pharmaceuticals on their initial degradation velocity and degradation rate constants ksfo in a mbbr reactor based on the used system the following conclusions can be drawn concentration dependent degradation was evident for 14 compounds while 4 compounds were recalcitrant at all test concentrations the initial degradation velocity of 10 compounds followed michaelis menten kinetics while the degradation velocity of the remaining four were either proportional to concentration or followed a substrate inhibition like pattern not modelled the behavior of the single first order constant ksfo deviated from what was expected from michaelis menten kinetics for some compounds at low concentrations the reason for this was suggested to be simplicity of the michaelis menten model occurrence of co metabolism and or mass transfer limitations at low concentrations the concentration effects were especially pronounced with starting concentrations exceeding 10 µg l 1 highlighting the importance of studies at environmental relevant concentrations the km values obtained from michaelis menten fits were except for trimethoprim and ibuprofen all above 10 µg l 1 table 1 which further confirms that concentration effects mostly occur

17561,conventional wastewater treatment lacks the ability to remove many pharmaceuticals this is leading to emissions to the natural aquatic environment where these compounds pose a risk to the aquatic organisms an advanced wastewater treatment technique that has shown promising results is moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr initial degradation velocity and degradation rate constants of the pharmaceuticals are important parameters for designing an optimal mbbr system however the degradation efficiency varies across studies and one of the most plausible causes might be initial concentration thus to verify the effect of initial concentration the degradation of a mixture of 18 pharmaceuticals at different initial concentrations was studied for this study mbbr s with very low bod loading were used as they were conditioned with effluent water the experiment was set up as a mbbr batch incubation using effluent wastewater as medium spiked with the 18 pharmaceuticals in seven different concentration levels approximately 0 300 µg l 1 the degradation of 14 out of 18 pharmaceuticals was concentration dependent the initial degradation velocity of the pharmaceuticals was either proportional to the initial concentration or was following a typical michaelis menten kinetic the degradation velocity of one compound i e sulfamethizole might have been inhibited at high concentrations the degradation rate constants from single first order fittings ksfo for some compounds deviated from the expected behavior at low concentrations below 10 µg l 1 this is suggested to be caused by simplicity of the michaelis menten model not taking possible occurrence of co metabolism and mass transfer limitations into account at low concentrations this study underlines the fact that k values cannot be interpreted without paying attention to the tested concentration level furthermore it shows that the used mbbrs was able to handle high concentrations of pharmaceuticals and that the most efficient removal occurs at concentrations above 100 µg l 1 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords moving bed biofilm reactor michaelis menten kinetics wastewater treatment plant effluent organic micropollutants pharmaceuticals 1 introduction pharmaceuticals are present in many different water bodies boulard et al 2020 hermes et al 2018 nantaba et al 2020 yang et al 2017 where they can cause adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems bruce et al 2010 farré et al 2008 gabet giraud et al 2014 osorio et al 2016 the pharmaceuticals can even reach the drinking water supplies at concentrations of ng l 1 if this is produced from surface water padhye et al 2014 snyder 2008 however the knowledge about the consequences on human health of long term exposure is still very limited boxall et al 2012 ikehata et al 2008 the pharmaceuticals mainly enter the environment via wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents daughton and ruhoy 2009 snyder et al 2003 ternes and joss 2006 vanderford et al 2003 as conventional wwtp s were not designed to remove these compounds falås et al 2012a yang et al 2017 some easily degradable pharmaceuticals such as paracetamol and ibuprofen can be removed up to 90 joss et al 2005 ternes and joss 2015 however many other pharmaceuticals are passing the conventional wwtp unchanged or only with a slight fraction removed falås et al 2012b joss et al 2005 plósz et al 2010a 2010b therefore additional treatment is required to control the release of pharmaceuticals to the receiving water and decrease the environmental impact moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs is a wastewater treatment technology that has shown promising results for removal of pharmaceuticals casas et al 2015a 2015b falås et al 2012b mbbrs contain small plastic carriers on which microorganisms grow to form a biofilm ødegaard et al 1994 these carriers with the adhered biofilm are moving in the reactor by means of a stirrer or by air bubbles during the aeration of the tank the degradation reaction kinetics and degradation mechanisms of pharmaceuticals in biological systems such as mbbrs can change depending on the initial concentration of the compound el taliawy et al 2018 hussain et al 2009 muller et al 2006 wilson 1985 this has for example been observed for mecoprop degradation in mbbrs at 10 50 and 100 µg l 1 where the degradation rate constant decreased with increasing concentration for the s enantiomer while no difference was observed for the r enantiomer escolà casas et al 2017 el taliawy et al 2018 observed significant lower degradation rate constants for some n oxides at 10 µg l 1 compared to 1 µg l 1 moreover for some n oxides the presence of a lag phase at 10 µg l 1 was observed on the other hand no significant difference was observed for mbbr degradation of diclofenac at 5 and 200 µg l 1 jewell et al 2016 a systematic study of the concentration effects on degradation velocity is needed to clarify if an overall trend exists for the role of pharmaceuticals initial concentration in their respective degradation concentration effects on degradation velocity can often follow michaelis menten kinetics the michaelis menten equation is originally developed for enzyme kinetics eq 1 johnson and goody 2011 michaelis and menten 1913 the concentration of enzymes is constant and the substrate is processed with an increasing velocity at increasing substrate concentrations while the enzymes are more saturated with increasing concentrations until the reaction velocity cannot increase any further this concentration dependent reaction velocity characterized by the michaelis menten expression has however also been observed for microbial systems in steady state e g for the microbial mediated hydrolysis of the insecticide parathion by e coli sd2 gilbert et al 2003 as well as degradation of the antibiotic tetracycline by a bacterial strain leng et al 2016 and p chlorobenzoate and chloroacetate by a microbial community from stream water boethling and alexander 1979 it is therefore reasonable to believe that michaelis menten kinetics can be used to assess concentration effects on degradation velocity of pharmaceuticals in mbbrs michaelis menten equation 1 v v m a x c k m c where v equals initial degradation velocity µg l 1 h 1 vmax is the maximum velocity µg l 1 h 1 at which all available enzyme molecules are occupied with the respective reaction km is the half saturation constant µg l 1 and c is the substrate concentration µg l 1 the reaction kinetics and the degradation rate constants of pharmaceuticals are important parameters in designing mbbr and they have to be well described in order to optimize the reactor design however if testing of the respective reaction kinetics is conducted at significantly higher concentrations of pharmaceuticals from 100 µg l 1 up to mg l 1 than the experienced in the environment often sub µg l 1 the results can possibly be misleading the objective of this study was to test whether for mbbr a michaelis menten relationship is relevant for the degradation of pharmaceuticals further if yes what would be a reasonable concentration range of pharmaceuticals in which linear equations can be used and what degradation efficiency can be expected at peak concentrations to conduct the study under realistic polishing step conditions in the present study the effect of initial pharmaceutical concentration on a degradation velocity and b degradation rate constant of the pharmaceuticals was investigated for the degradation of 18 pharmaceuticals in lab scale mbbr reactors

sequencing batch reactor with sequence cycles of 3 5 d the used mbbr system was a pure biofilm reactor with no sludge incubations for the determination of reactions kinetics were conducted as following seven duplicates of laboratory reactors 200 ml erlenmeyer flasks with mbbr chips containing effluent wastewater spiked with pharmaceuticals mixture in seven concentration levels were used the seven levels had the approximate concentrations of 0 indigenous concentration only 1 3 10 30 100 and 300 µg l 1 exact concentration of each compound can be found in table s2 typical indigenous pharmaceutical concentrations in danish effluent wastewater are below 5 µg l 1 liang et al 2019 tang et al 2017 which is also observed for the wastewater used in this study table s2 the degradation of x ray contrast media was studied at 5x higher concentrations than the other compounds as these are usually present in wastewater at this proportionally higher concentrations than the other pharmaceuticals margot et al 2015b to prepare the incubations a stock solution of the pharmaceuticals mixture in methanol were added to each empty flask and left overnight to evaporate the methanol the reactors were covered with aluminum foil to prevent photo degradation the day succeeding the spike 75 ml of effluent wastewater from bjergmarken wwtp roskilde denmark were added to each reactor the reactors were placed on a shaker and shaken for 30 min to allow the compounds to homogenously dissolve in the water successively 10 anoxkaldnes k5 carriers anoxkaldnes lund sweden with biofilm were added to each of the reactors the time registration started and the t0 sample was taken from each reactor four erlenmeyer flasks were utilized as controls without biofilm at concentrations 0 1 30 and 300 µg l 1 ten new carriers without any biofilm were added to each of these control reactors the reactors were placed on a horizontal shaker to ensure constant mixing during the entire duration of the experiment all reactors were closed with a loose cover of aluminum foil to avoid dust contamination but allowing air to enter the reactors and keep the aerobic condition all over the experiment period no additional air was supplied to the reactors as the low bod content of the reaction medium effluent wastewater bod 4 39 2 70 mg l 1 results in a low oxygen consumption after taking 7 samples of 900 µl each from each reactor one carrier was removed to maintain the ratio between the water volume and number of carriers as constant as possible the ratio throughout the experiment was 7 5 ml wastewater per carrier equaling a filling ratio of 30 sampling was continued for 5 days where 10 samples per reactor were collected at time points 0 1 2 5 5 5 10 24 35 48 100 and 120 h 2 3 biomass determination the biomass was determined by taking out two carriers from each reactor and drying them overnight at 105 c and then they were placed in a desiccator to cool down and successively be weighted two of the new carriers from each control reactor were treated in the same way and weighted the biomass content on the carriers was calculated as the difference in weight average between carriers with biofilm and new carriers and it was found to be 0 061 g carrier thus the reactors operated with 8 16 g biomass l 1 2 4 analytical method all analysis were performed by high performance

program r version 3 5 1 the effect of initial concentration on degradation velocity the initial degradation velocity for each compound and concentration level was calculated as the linear slope µg l 1 h 1 from the first linear part of the degradation in the concentration vs time plot until 10 of the compound had been removed dt10 volatilization of the pharmaceuticals and sorption to glass or to the plastic carriers have been found to be negligible torresi et al 2016 however sorption to the biofilm was not monitored in this study implying that for cationic pharmaceuticals erythromycin clarithromycin atenolol citalopram metoprolol and venlafaxine some of the removal could potentially be due to sorption torresi et al 2017 to account for analytical errors at least three time points were used to assess the initial degradation velocity for the three compounds where dt10 was reached before the third time point dt20 or dt50 was used instead atenolol dt20 ibuprofen dt50 acetyl sulfadiazine dt50 the initial velocity was plotted against the initial concentration and fitted with either linear regression eq 2 or michaelis menten kinetics eq 1 presented in the introduction using the drc r package for analysis of dose response curves ritz et al 2015 linear regression 2 v a c where v is the initial degradation velocity µg l 1 h 1 a is the proportionality constant h 1 and c is the concentration of the respective pharmaceutical µg l 1 for selection of the best model for the data linear regression or michaelis menten kinetics the akaike information criterion aic cavanaugh and neath 2019 was calculated for each model fit aic is an ubiquitous statistical tool for model selection it estimates the relative information amount lost by the model and thereby gives a value describing quality relative to other models the model with the lower value is the best fit for the data however if the difference in aic aic is less than 10 both models show the same quality 2 5 1 degradation kinetics degradation kinetics data from the individual pharmaceuticals at the different concentration levels were fitted to single first order sfo kinetics eq 3 a with the corresponding

separately as each kinetic represents a time series of repeated measurements from the same experimental unit the model fits were evaluated with visual interpretation of residual and quantile quantile plots 2 5 2 the effect of initial concentration on the degradation rate constant the degradation rate constants derived from the sfo fits ksfo were plotted against initial concentration to test if the ksfo values for a compound were significantly different for the different concentration levels a nonlinear mixed effects model jiang and kopp schneider 2014 was used the nonlinear mixed effects model is taking the variety within and between the concentration levels into account simultaneously thus giving an estimate of which ksfo values are significantly different α 0 05 from each other 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation velocity the initial degradation velocity of 14 degradable pharmaceuticals was plotted against initial concentration shown in fig 1 for sotalol metoprolol citalopram and ibuprofen and in si figure s1 s6 for the remaining ten compounds sulfamethizole acetyl sulfadiazine trimethoprim erythromycin clarithromycin atenolol diclofenac iohexol iomeprol and iopromide the other four compounds iopamidol venlafaxine phenazone and sulfamethoxazole were not degraded at any concentration level during the 120 h incubation time and were therefore excluded from further data analysis these compounds are known to be persistent under similar conditions dt50 500 h liang et al 2019 of the 14 degradable compounds the initial degradation velocity of ten compounds followed michaelis menten kinetics examples are shown in fig 1 while four did not the initial degradation velocity of the ten compounds acetyl sulfadiazine sotalol citalopram ibuprofen erythromycin clarithromycin trimethoprim metoprolol atenolol and diclofenac followed michaelis menten kinetics four of these trimethoprim metoprolol atenolol and diclofenac showed equally good fits to linear regression as stated by a difference in aic below 10 when substrate concentrations are lower than the half saturation constant km c km initial degradation velocity often shows a linear relation with initial concentration and can be fitted with linear regression as well as michaelis menten kinetics for the compounds in this study where michaelis menten kinetics and linear regression both showed good fits table 1 the estimated km values were higher than the tested concentration range for all compounds except metoprolol thus for these compounds atenolol diclofenac citalopram the tested concentration range was below saturation for the remaining compounds an initial deflection of the curve towards saturation was observed within the tested concentration range the largest vmax values were found in the order atenolol citalopram sotalol acetyl sulfadiazine diclofenac clarithromycin ibuprofen metoprolol erythromycin trimethoprim these maximum degradation velocities were estimated to be reached at high concentrations 100 µg l 1 exceeding environmental relevant ranges up to 10 µg l 1 the order of initial degradation velocity at the more environmental relevant concentration 3 µg l 1 was ibuprofen acetyl sulfadiazine erythromycin clarithromycin atenolol citalopram metoprolol trimethoprim diclofenac sotalol this order of the compounds follows with few exceptions the degradability order shown in mbbr studies elsewhere casas et al 2015a 2015b liang et al 2019 tang et al 2017 as to the authors best knowledge no other studies on concentration effects on initial degradation velocity have been published on biofilms thus the present data can only be compared to studies with pure enzymes or suspended bacterial cultures concentration dependent degradation of pharmaceuticals using laccase enzymes have previously been shown lonappan et al 2017 margot et al 2015a 2013 diclofenac degradation at concentrations between 50 and 5000 µg l 1 followed michaelis menten kinetics for fungi produced laccase enzymes constant enzyme activity of 50 u l 1 with a vmax of 80 6 µg l 1 h 1 and km of 2675 µg l 1 lonappan et al 2017 these values are higher than the ones found in our study vmax 3 32 µg l 1 h 1 and km 462 µg l 1 however taking into account that our degradation study is with a mixed biofilm community and lonappan et al s is with pure laccase enzyme the numbers are somewhat in range laccase mediated oxidation constant enzyme activity of 450 u l 1 of sulfamethoxazole at high concentrations 13 35 mg l 1 showed a linear increase in oxidation velocity with concentration margot et al 2015a in our study sulfamethoxazole did not degrade at any tested concentration range michaelis menten kinetics have also been used to describe degradation in microbial communities gilbert et al 2003 found that parathion hydrolysis by an engineered microorganism od600nm 1 4 1 7 at five concentrations in the range of 0 583 mg l 1 followed michaelis menten and estimated the parathion half saturation constant km to be 47 mg l 1 another study investigated the degradation of tetracycline 10 200 mg l 1 by the bacterial strain stenotrophomonas maltophilia dt1 1 v v od600nm 1 solution leng et al 2016 it was found that the degradation velocity at concentrations below 100 mg l 1 followed michaelis menten kinetics with a vmax of 62 14 mg l 1d 1 and a km of 80 52 mg l 1 common for those two studies is that they both dealt with bacterial strains adapted to the studied compounds in the mg l 1 range i e under catabolic conditions in our study we show that michaelis menten kinetics also appear in the µg l 1 range of pharmaceuticals with a mixed biofilm community grown in effluent wastewater four compounds did not follow michaelis menten kinetics iohexole iomeprol iopromide and sulfamethizole iohexol iomeprol and iopromide figure s6 were fitted to both michaelis menten kinetics and linear regression however the large variations in degradation velocity resulted in very high values of vmax and km with even higher standard errors and the michaelis menten fit was therefore deemed unrealistic the initial degradation velocity of sulfamethizole appeared to follow substrate inhibition figure s3 however the substrate inhibition model showed a very poor fit thus a similar approach as in gilbert et al 2003 was followed where a linear model were plotted for the increasing part following the same approach for sulfamethizole yielded a linear model for the increasing velocity at concentrations below 40 µg l 1 table 1 the presence of human metabolites in the wastewater was not monitored however sulfamethizole is known to be excreted mainly unmetabolized with more than 80 excreted as sulfamethizole and less than 5 as acetyl sulfamethizole vree and hekster 1985 thus the presence of human metabolites of sulfamethizole is not thought to have an influence parameters from the linear regression and the michaelis menten fitting for all compounds are shown in table 1 to sum up working range with thin biofilms like the ones applied in this study gave maximum degradation velocity from 0 081 10 4 µg l 1 h 1 depending on the compound table 1 the concentration level at which the saturation started varied between the compounds as seen from the half saturation constant km 1 7 629 5 µg l 1 table 1 however for most compounds in this study concentrations up to 3 µg l 1 can be regarded as a safe level where no saturation is expected 3 2 degradation rate constants the degradation of the 14 compounds at nearly all concentration levels could be fitted to sfo kinetics the degradation of sotalol metoprolol citalopram and ibuprofen at the seven concentration levels are shown as example in fig 2 and 3 as relative concentration over time while the remaining compounds are shown in si figure s7 10 for both clarithromycin and erythromycin degradation was observed in all the control reactors without biofilm for ibuprofen some degradation was also observed in the control for the lowest control concentration 3 µg l 1 the controls consisted of effluent wastewater containing residual suspended biomass thus the degradation of clarithromycin and erythromycin as well as ibuprofen at low concentrations cannot be assigned to the biofilm alone but is a result of suspended biomass as well as biofilm this phenomenon has also been observed elsewhere liang et al 2019 the effect of initial concentration on the sfo derived degradation rate constant ksfo is depicted in fig 4 for citalopram metoprolol ibuprofen and sotalol and in si figure s11 14 for the remaining compounds ksfo values and indications of significant differences for all compounds and concentration levels as well as general sfo parameters are shown in si table s5 two different behaviors of ksfo are visible in fig 3 for ibuprofen and sotalol the ksfo values decreased as initial concentration increased while for citalopram and metoprolol there was an initial increase in the ksfo values a decrease in ksfo value with increasing concentration is the expected pattern for michaelis menten kinetics where the slope in a given point of the michaelis menten curve which corresponds to ksfo is largest at low concentrations and approaches zero when the system is saturated besides ibuprofen and sotalol the decrease in the ksfo values was also observed for trimethoprim erythromycin atenolol and diclofenac figure s11 13 the other pattern where ksfo showed an initial increase was observed for citalopram and metoprolol fig 4 as well as for sulfamethizole ac sulfadiazine clarithromycin iohexol iopromide and iomeprol figure s11 14 of these compounds only acetyl sulfadiazine clarithromycin metoprolol and citalopram could be fitted to michaelis menten kinetics the deviations in the expected ksfo behavior indicates that michaelis menten kinetics for these compounds were not fulfilled at low concentrations c 10 µg l 1 no apparent similarities in compound properties molecular mass molecular volume pka and log kow were found for these compounds additionally there was no correlation between the compound properties and km when plotted for all compounds michaelis menten kinetics was developed for one enzyme one substrate systems michaelis and menten 1913 in our case we had a mixed microbial community and therefore probably multiple active enzyme systems furthermore the degradation of the pharmaceuticals was studied simultaneously in a mixture with the presence of growth substrate in the form of recalcitrant carbon residual cod in wastewater terms present in the effluent wastewater it is therefore likely that the michaelis menten model was too simple to fit all our data another aspect is the possibility of co metabolism in which the organisms use other compounds than the observed micropollutant as main source for carbon energy and nutrients co metabolism has been shown or suggested as the main mechanism for degradation when the concentration of pharmaceuticals is low typically below 10 µg l 1 kassotaki et al 2016 müller et al 2013 nguyen et al 2019 ternes and joss 2015 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 as described in the materials and methods section the batch incubations in this study were all run on the same batch of effluent wastewater thus the bod content in the different reactors were the same around 4 mg l 1 without considering the increase originating from the spiked pharmaceuticals themselves bod consumption was not monitored the michaelis menten model is often too simple to describe co metabolism which could be an explanation for our observed deviation in ksfo behavior at low concentrations other studies have used expanded michaelis menten models that for example includes competitive inhibition between growth substrate and micropollutans chang and alvarez cohen 1995 and nad p h regeneration and cell growth decay sipkema et al 2000 the relevance of these models to our system cannot be tested as the required measurements were not planned in our experimental design another explanation for the deviation in ksfo values at low concentrations could be the presence of mass transfer limitations torresi et al 2017 it has also been shown for another micropollutant atrazine under catabolic conditions that mass transfer can be the limiting factor for biodegradation at low concentrations ehrl et al 2019 with 10 12 µg l 1 as a minimum substrate concentration sufficient for the cells energy demand kundu et al 2019 in the present study it was not possible to discriminate between the occurrence of co metabolism and mass transfer limitations as seen from our results ksfo values for a single compound can differ considerably up to a 350 or even up to 2500 for the very slow degrading compounds depending on the investigated concentration approximately 0 300 µg l 1 it is therefore important to pay attention to test concentration when interpreting ksfo values typical pharmaceutical concentrations in aquatic compartments are in the range of ng l 1 to a few µg l 1 and rarely exceeding 10 µg l 1 barbosa et al 2016 krzeminski et al 2019 thus staying below 10 µg l 1 ensures an experimental design close to the environmental situation our results also show that mbbrs can handle high concentrations of pharmaceuticals at high concentrations the percentage removal is small however the absolute removal is high making the removal more efficient than at low concentrations taking sotalol as an example we showed that the same mbbr carriers during one hour could remove 25 times as much sotalol from the 400 µg l 1 level compared to the environmental relevant 3 µg l 1 level the estimated vmax for sotalol 3 94 µg l 1 h 1 compared to the velocity at 3 µg l 1 0 07 µg l 1 h 1 show that mbbr carriers can remove 54 times more sotalol at its maximum velocity these results indicate that mbbr can be used to treat wastewater with high concentrations of pharmaceuticals for example product water from forward osmosis 4 conclusion the present study investigated the effect of initial concentration of 18 pharmaceuticals on their initial degradation velocity and degradation rate constants ksfo in a mbbr reactor based on the used system the following conclusions can be drawn concentration dependent degradation was evident for 14 compounds while 4 compounds were recalcitrant at all test concentrations the initial degradation velocity of 10 compounds followed michaelis menten kinetics while the degradation velocity of the remaining four were either proportional to concentration or followed a substrate inhibition like pattern not modelled the behavior of the single first order constant ksfo deviated from what was expected from michaelis menten kinetics for some compounds at low concentrations the reason for this was suggested to be simplicity of the michaelis menten model occurrence of co metabolism and or mass transfer limitations at low concentrations the concentration effects were especially pronounced with starting concentrations exceeding 10 µg l 1 highlighting the importance of studies at environmental relevant concentrations the km values obtained from michaelis menten fits were except for trimethoprim and ibuprofen all above 10 µg l 1 table 1 which further confirms that concentration effects mostly occur

17562,carbohydrate rich waste streams can be used for bioproduction of medium chain carboxylic acids mcca such as caproic acid the carbohydrates in these streams can be converted to lactic acid as the initial fermentation product which can then be fermented to mcca by chain elongation in this process chain elongators compete for lactic acid with other bacterial groups that for instance ferment lactic acid to propionic and acetic acid understanding the drivers that control the competition between these two pathways is essential to maximizing mcca production this study aimed to investigate the competition between chain elongating and propionic acid producing organisms as a function of operational ph operation of long term lactic acid fermenting reactors with varying ph values showed that ph values above 6 resulted in a propionic acid producing community dominated by veillonella and aminobacterium at ph values below 6 the community moved towards chain elongation with communities dominated by caproiciproducens short term incubations showed that rates of lactic acid consumption were strongly reduced at ph below 6 7 7 1 2 mm lactic acid h 1 at ph 6 5 0 74 0 33 mm lactic acid h 1 at ph 5 5 similar to observations in long term reactors when a chain elongating community adapted to ph 5 5 was used for short term incubations at ph 6 5 propionic acid was the dominant product the results of this study show that ph below 6 stimulate lactic acid chain elongators through kinetic effects and potentially improved energetics providing a tool for microbial management of mcca producing systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioproduction chain elongation caproic acid lactic acid 1 introduction bioproduction of chemicals from organic rich waste and side streams is an attractive approach to valorize these costly to treat streams one product that has received much attention is caproic acid a six carbon medium chain carboxylic acid mcca with proposed applications as feed additive antibiotic substitute and corrosion inhibitor as well as feedstock for the production of fragrances flavors fuels and plasticizers chaincraft 2019 caproic acid can be produced microbially through a process called chain elongation in which an electron donor e g ethanol lactic acid sugars is used to increase the carbon chain length of a short chain carboxylic acid scca 2 to 5 carbon atom chain in two carbon increments steinbusch et al 2011 this metabolism named reverse beta oxidation was first studied in clostridium kluyveri an ethanol utilizing chain elongating organism barker and taha 1941 seedorf et al 2008 several studies have demonstrated the production of caproic acid from waste streams with ethanol as substrate for chain elongation agler et al 2012 grootscholten et al 2013 however these processes typically require the addition of exogeneous ethanol a significant contributor to the environmental impact chen et al 2017 and accounting for a large fraction of the process cost an alternative route for production of mcca from waste streams avoiding exogenous substrate additions is to use the carbohydrates embedded in the waste streams some organisms are capable of chain elongation with sugars as substrate jeon et al 2017 kim et al 2015 lanjekar et al 2014 willems and collins 1996 most mixed community systems observe both lactic acid producers e g lactobacillus olsenella and suspected lactic acid driven chain elongators andersen et al 2017 carvajal arroyo et al 2019 duber et al 2018 some reports have also physically separated the conversion of carbohydrates to lactic acid and subsequent conversion to caproic acid in two stage reactor systems khor et al 2017 xu et al 2018 while lactic acid driven caproic acid production fits well within the context of biorefineries and the valorization of carbohydrate rich waste streams there are additional aspects to be considered for instance product selectivity lactic acid serves as substrate for different competing secondary fermentative pathways fig 1 in reverse beta oxidation the first step of the pathway is the conversion of lactic acid to acetyl coa which can be condensed with another acetyl coa molecule to produce acetoacetyl coa this acetoacetyl coa is then converted to butyryl coa by transferring the coa group from butyryl coa to acetate butyric acid is produced while the acetyl coa can be reused in the reverse beta oxidation cycle alternatively another acetyl coa can be added to butyryl coa to yield caproyl coa and in turn caproic acid some members of clostridium can also elongate lactic acid to butyric acid without production of caproic acid these organisms do not use reverse beta oxidation but instead convert butyryl coa to butyric acid through phosphorylation because acetyl coa is not regenerated this pathway is linear rather than cyclical diez gonzalez et al 1995 ingham et al 1998 lastly lactic acid can also be converted to mixtures of propionic and acetic acid this can happen through two distinct pathways yielding the same products in the wood werkman cycle as present in propionibacterium acidipropionici lactic acid is first converted to pyruvate which is subsequently converted to succinate and then propionyl coa to ultimately yield propionic acid in other organisms for instance megasphaera elsdenii lactic acid is first dehydrated to acrylyl coa which is then reduced to propionyl coa and ultimately propionic acid both of these pathways require nadh for a reductive step in the metabolism which can be generated during the oxidation of lactic acid to acetic acid to maintain the electron balance parizzi et al 2012 prabhu et al 2012 while the metabolic pathways are relatively well understood there is less information about interactions between these functional guilds in this context ph is a key operational parameter that could critically affect these relationships and the resulting product profile ruminococcaceae cpb6 a bacterium producing caproic acid from lactic acid prefers mildly acidic ph i e 5 5 6 zhu et al 2017 propionibacterium species on the other hand have been shown to produce acetic acid and propionic acid from lactic acid at ph values of approx 6 5 7 luo et al 2017 while growth rates of propionibacterium acidipropionici drop rapidly below ph 6 lewis and yang 1992 m elsdenii is an outlier in this context it produces c2 c5 carboxylic acids from lactic acid and grows well at ph 6 5 7 2 but growth rates are highest around ph 5 5 6 and only begin to decrease when ph drops below 5 5 5 choi et al 2013 counotte and prins 1981 weimer and moen 2013 however these observations were made in pure cultures and may not translate to more complex mixed communities teague and weiss 2015 therefore it is important to investigate how ph will impact lactic acid driven fermentations in mixed communities harboring these different organisms in this study the competition between lactic acid utilizing organisms producing either propionic butyric or caproic acid was investigated by long term operation of mixed culture lactic acid fed systems at varying ph product profiles and community composition were analyzed to better understand the steering mechanism of ph additionally batch tests were performed at different ph to investigate the production and consumption rates of the considered groups of lactic acid consumers and how this contributes to their competition this resulted in further suggestions on how to stimulate lactic acid consuming caproic acid producers and how to steer lactic acid mediated processes towards more selective caproic acid production 2 materials methods 2 1 long term reactor operation two reactors were inoculated with a pre adapted lactic acid chain elongating culture which was originally enriched from a granular fermentation reactor converting a carbohydrate rich stream to caproic acid with lactic acid as an intermediate carvajal arroyo et al 2019 throughout all experiments a synthetic medium supplementary information s 1 1 was used that mimicked the salts composition of this carbohydrate rich waste stream but substituting sugars with 257 mm lactic acid as 60 na lactate syrup multi port reactors ochs glasgerätebau bovenden germany with a working volume of 900 ml were operated as continuous stirred tank reactors cstr with magnetic stirring

hcl maintained ph at the desired setpoint initially one reactor r1 was operated at ph 5 5 while the second reactor r2 was operated at ph 5 throughout the entire experiment r1 was kept at ph 5 5 while ph in r2 was gradually increased from 5 to 6 5 in increments of 0 5 ph units and back down to ph 5 table 1 keeping at least 3 5 hrt between changes in ph to ensure reaching a new steady state

later analysis of substrates and products at selected timepoints biomass samples were taken for cell quantification with flow cytometry these samples were first filtered over 20 µm filters bd biosciences erembodegem belgium before dilution in filtered evian water 2 2 short term incubations batch experiments were used to assess rates of lactic acid driven fermentations to understand the role of consumption and production rates in the competition between caproic acid and propionic acid producers batch experiments were conducted at ph between 5 and 6 5 using inocula acclimated to different ph batch experiments using inoculum of r1 i e fixed ph of 5 5 allowed monitoring of short term ph changes experiments inoculated with broth from r2 were used to investigate the effects of long term ph changes on substrate consumption and product formation rates of these communities multi port reactors ochs glasgerätebau bovenden germany with a total volume of 1 l were filled with 100 ml of basal medium 257 mm lactic acid corrected to the desired ph bottles were sparged with n2 co2 for at least 15 min before inoculation with 100 ml of freshly harvested inoculum an overview of each experiment with set ph and inoculum used is given in table 2 batch experiments were ph controlled by dosing of 2 m hcl with online ph controllers prominent belgium after inoculation reactors were incubated with magnetic stirring for 7 days in a temperature controlled room 34 c sampling twice daily for the first 5 days of the experiment and once on the final day samples were taken for measurement of od and substrate and product analyses after filtration 0 20 µm and storage 20 c at each timepoint acid consumption and gas production were monitored all batch experiments were performed in triplicate replicates showing no growth were removed from further analysis but all experiments had at least two replicates 2 3 calculations all errors reported in this study are standard deviations over all replicates n 2 3 substrate consumption and product formation rates during short term incubations were calculated as the slope of a linear regression over the linear phase of batch incubations

free energy change under environmental conditions δg1 r was calculated between ph 4 5 and 7 according to kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2010 several assumptions were made for these calculations i concentrations of soluble products were taken from the steady state product profile of r1 at ph 5 5 ii partial pressures of h2 ph2 and co2 in the headspace were assumed to be both 0 5 atm iii the concentration of hco3 was calculated from henry s law and the co2 hco3 equilibrium the full equations used for these calculations and thermodynamic data can be found in supplementary information section s 1 2 furthermore to assess the impact of ph2 on these different metabolisms alternative scenarios with a variation of 20 in ph2 i e ph2 of 0 4 and 0 6 atm were calculated 2 4 analytical methods lactic acid and acetic acid were determined by ion chromatography while c3 to c8 carboxylic acids were analyzed by gas chromatography see supplementary information s 1 3 total cell counts were analyzed by flow cytometry in accordance with props et al 2016 to be used in combination with community composition by next generation sequencing to quantify absolute taxon abundances props et al 2017

rarefaction was applied before analysis of the filtered data 3 results 3 1 long term lactic acid fermentation the long term effect of ph on lactic acid fermentation was investigated in two lactic acid fed cstrs at either fixed ph of 5 5 r1 or varying ph between 5 and 6 5 r2 fig 2 in r1 elongated products consistently dominated the product profile specifically butyric acid 22 8 10 5 mm 0 46 0 21 mol e l 1 valeric acid 30 16 11 45 mm 0 78 0 30 mol e l 1 and caproic acid 25 9 7 0 mm 0 83 0 22 mol e l 1 can be observed throughout the whole experimental period fig 2a shorter chain products were also consistently present in the product profile i e acetic acid 15 4 12 3 mm or 0 12 0 10 mol e l 1 and propionic acid 17 1 16 8 mm or 0 24 0 23 mol e l 1 additionally unconsumed lactic acid was transiently observed in the effluent of the reactor with variable concentrations in r2 the long term effect of varying ph was investigated by stepwise increasing ph from 5 to 6 5 in steps of 0 5 ph units followed by a stepwise decrease in ph down to ph 5 in phase i ph 5 table 1 the reactor community never achieved sufficiently high activity to consume all lactic acid over the steady state period in this phase table 1 caproic acid 19 3 7 6 mm 0 62 0 25 mol e l 1 was the main product fig 2b but a large fraction of lactic acid was left unconverted in the effluent 158 1 47 8 mm out of 257 mm 1 90 0 57 mol e l 1 out of 3 1 mol e 1 l 1 after switching to ph 5 5 phase ii nearly all lactic acid was consumed 6 9 11 8 mm 0 08 0 14 mol e l 1 in the effluent initially butyric acid was the main product up to 78 7 mm or 1 57 mol e l 1 day 49 but this switched to caproic acid later up to 74 0 mm or 2 37 mol e l 1 day 63 eventually the reactor stabilized with a product spectrum dominated by butyric acid 40 5 7 4 mm or 0 81 0 15 mol e l 1 and caproic acid 28 0 8 0 mm or 0 90 0 26 mol e l 1 increasing ph to 6 phase iii resulted in caproic acid 36 2 12 6 mm 1 16 0 40 mol e l 1 becoming dominant over butyric acid 15 5 6 1 mm 0 31 0 12 mol e l 1 as a product additionally shorter chain products acetic acid propionic acid started accumulating acetic acid from 7 3 2 7 mm or 0 06 0 02 mol e l 1 in phase ii to 11 2 0 8 mm or 0 09 0 01 mol e l 1 in phase iii propionic acid from 6 9 2 5 mm or 0 10 0 03 mol e l 1 to 23 3 12 1 mm or 0 33 0 17 mol e l 1 at ph 6 5 phase iv the product spectrum fully shifted to short chain products although at that ph sulfate reduction became problematic although sulfides were not quantified the amount of sulfate supplied means that at most 0 006 mol e l 1 could have been diverted towards sulfide negligible compared to the 3 1 mol e l 1 supplied as lactic acid to avoid issues with h2s toxicity sulfate concentrations were lowered from 0 11 g l 1 to 0 029 g l 1 on day 105 phase v after which the product profile stabilized acetic acid 102 6 4 8 mm 0 82 0 04 mol e l 1 and propionic acid 119 4 4 1 mm 1 67 0 06 mol e l 1 dominated the product profile while concentrations of caproic acid were negligible 1 0 0 0 mm 0 03 0 00 mol e l 1 when ph was reduced down to 6 again phase vi production of acetic acid and propionic acid dropped sharply 19 9 19 2 mm or 0 16 0 15 mol e l 1 and 59 7 9 3 mm or 0 84 0 13 mol e l 1 respectively while butyric acid became the dominant product 66 4 10 0 mm 1 33 0 20 mol e l 1 further reducing the ph to 5 5 phase vii initially led to a similar profile but switched to a new steady state in which caproic acid became more dominant 32 6 6 6 mm 1 04 0 20 mol e l 1 while acetic and propionic concentrations dropped 23 0 6 7 mm or 0 18 0 05 mol e l 1 and 34 7 9 1 mm or 0 49 0 13 mol e l 1 respectively closely resembling the output at ph 5 5 in phase ii day 44 83 when lowering ph back to the original ph of 5 phase viii it could be seen that caproic acid concentrations remained close to those at ph 5 5 30 0 8 4 mm 0 96 0 27 mol e l 1 while concentrations of shorter products dropped further acetic acid 5 3 3 6 mm or 0 04 0 03 mol e l 1 propionic acid 9 1 11 3 mm or 0 13 0 16 mol e l 1 and butyric and valeric acid were instead the second and third product 31 3 5 0 mm or 0 63 0 10 mol e l 1 20 0 1 1 mm or 0 52 0 03 mol e l 1 3 2 impact of ph on community composition community structure was analyzed to test the hypothesis that mildly acidic ph would lead to the enrichment of chain elongators fig 3 in r1 the community was initially dominated by veillonella but shifted to propionibacterium both of which are known propionic acid producers parizzi et al 2012 rogosa 1964 and eventually caproiciproducens a genus characterized by one type species capable of caproic acid production kim et al 2015 in r2 the varying ph caused clear shifts in relative abundances of community members caproiciproducens classified otus were the most abundant 67 8 genus in the community fig 3b as ph increased to 6 tyzzerella became more abundant in the community above ph 6 however the community became almost exclusively composed of veillonella and aminobacterium with only a minimal caproiciproducens presence 2 0 while veillonella is known to generate propionic acid from lactic acid rogosa 1964 an isolate of aminobacterium a colombiense can grow on amino acids but not on lactic acid baena et al 1998 when ph was lowered back to 6 the abundance of aminobacterium lowered giving way to clostridium sensu stricto lowering ph to 5 5 allowed the recovery of caproiciproducens eventually becoming the most abundant genus in the community at ph 5 65 6 these community shifts from caproiciproducens to veillonella and back again closely reflect the shifts in product profile fig 2 and active pathways supplementary information s 2 1 observed in the system these trends were also validated by absolute taxon abundance with flow cytometry showing that trends were not influenced by changes in total cell concentration supplementary information s 2 3 3 3 short term effect of ph on lactic acid fermentation exploring how short term ph changes affect the product profile could give information on what role consumption and production rates play in the competition between chain elongators and propionic acid producers this was done by batch incubations of communities from r1 and r2 at ph between 5 and 6 5 at ph 6 5 rates of lactic acid consumption for r2 inoculated experiments were an order of magnitude higher than those at ph 5 5 92 0 14 0 mm e h 1 compared to 9 0 4 0 mm e h 1 fig 4 biomass concentrations were not quantified during these experiments but od in the reactor when the batch incubations were started was 3 07 at ph 5 5 and 3 26 at ph 6 5 supplementary information figure s 4 the amount of biomass inoculated in the system was in the same order of magnitude and the change in activity was not an artefact due to varying biomass concentrations similarly lactic acid consumption rates in r1 inoculated experiments increased from 12 6 7 8 mm e h 1 at ph 5 5 to 48 4 4 4 mm e h 1 at ph 6 5 a second observation is the dependence of product profiles on both incubation ph and inoculum fig 4 and supplementary information section s 2 5 at ph 6 5 incubations of the adapted r2 community exclusively resulted in acetic and propionic acid as products on the other hand the unadapted r1 community still produced valeric 4 7 0 8 mm e 1 h 1 and caproic acid 4 9 2 6 mm e 1 h1 although to a lesser extent than e g at ph 6 6 4 0 7 mm e 1 h 1 valeric acid 9 7 0 0 mm e 1 h 1 caproic acid interestingly the adapted community r2 at ph 6 produced only butyric acid and propionic acid this reflects what happens in the reactor at that point in time as the switch back to caproic acid production only happened when ph was lowered further to 5 5 3 4 thermodynamics of lactic acid driven fermentations to assess how thermodynamics may influence competition between propionic acid producers and chain elongators we analyzed the effect of ph on the energy released during fermentation at different phs i e δg1 r fig 5 it can be observed that δg1 r of acetic and propionic production from lactic acid is unaffected by ph and remains constant at 49 9 kj mol lactic acid 1 at ph 6 5 energy generation for butyric acid production 36 3 kj mol lactic acid 1 and caproic acid 42 6 kj mol lactic acid 1 is lower than that for propionic acetic fermentation however the thermodynamics of these pathways are affected by ph with lower δg1 r so more energy released at lower ph the slope is stronger for caproic acid production 3 9 kj mol lactic acid 1 per ph unit than for butyric acid 2 9 kj mol lactic acid 1 per ph unit and eventually caproic acid becomes more favorable than acetic propionic acid fermentation below ph 4 52 while this is below ph 4 5 for butyric acid production the impact of h2 on δg1 r for these different reactions was assessed by varying ph2 with 20 around the assumed value 0 5 atm within the tested range the impact of ph2 is limited and ph has a stronger impact on δg1 r for production of butyric and caproic acid 4 discussion 4 1 why does low ph favor lactic acid chain elongators a clear conclusion that can be made from this study is that mildly acidic phs lower than 6 are favorable for the lactic acid chain elongating organisms present in this enrichment culture this observation is consistent with previous reports ruminococcaceae cpb6 the only isolated lactic acid chain elongator so far has been shown to grow optimally between ph 5 5 and 6 zhu et al 2017 while a reactor with in line extraction and fed with a mixture of lactic acid and butyric acid showed improved selectivity for caproic acid production by lowering ph to 5 kucek et al 2016 we show here that the observation of caproic acid production at low ph for the community obtained here is replicable even after losing chain elongation activity at high ph caproiciproducens was initially the most abundant genus in the r2 community at ph 5 5 when ph was increased to 6 5 for 40 days 10 hrt srt product output switched to pure acetic and propionic acid production and the community became enriched in the propionic acid producing veillonella when ph was lowered back to 5 caproic acid production completely recovered with caproiciproducens as the most abundant genus this observation shows there is a strong driver for organisms to favor chain elongation over propionic acid fermentation at mildly acidic ph based on the data reported here we can explore the competition between propionic acid producers and chain elongators kinetics and thermodynamics are two potential drivers creating competitive advantages for one functional guild over another the production and consumption rates fig 4 and thermodynamic calculations fig 5 reported here can indicate how these two factors can create competitive advantages acetic and propionic acid production releases more energy than caproic acid production at neutral ph fig 5 additionally the rates of acetic and propionic acid production are higher as evidenced by acetic and propionic acid being the dominant products when incubating a community producing caproic acid ph 5 5 at ph 6 5 fig 4 these observations indicate that an open culture fermentation of lactic acid at circumneutral ph will inherently move towards production of acetic and propionic acid chain elongation activity was observed at higher ph during short term incubation but was lost in the long term reactor this further indicates lactic acid chain elongators in this system were outcompeted by propionic acid producers which would preclude a long term open culture bioproduction processes from lactic acid at ph 6 5 when lowering ph the advantage shifts to chain elongating organisms as shown by the switch in product spectrum from a mixture of acetic and propionic acid to a mixture of c4 c6 carboxylic acids fig 2 additionally analysis of the contribution of different pathways in the system demonstrated that chain elongation consumed most lactic acid at ph 5 5 supplementary information s 2 1 mildly acidic ph 6 0 incubations were consistently slower than incubations at high ph 6 5 fig 4 this only shows that rates of chain elongation at low ph are slower than those of acetic propionic acid production at neutral ph however there is information missing on the rates of propionic acid producers at low ph for p acidipropionici converting lactic acid to acetic and propionic acid it has been shown that its growth rate on lactic acid is severely affected by low ph dropping from 0 097 h 1 at ph 7 to 0 027 h 1 at ph 5 5 hsu and yang 1991 lewis and yang 1992 while the maximum growth rate of m elsdenii producing c2 c5 carboxylic acids from lactic acid is approx 0 4 h 1 at a ph of 5 5 only dropping sharply below ph 5 counotte and prins 1981 this indicates caproic acid producers might have a kinetic advantage at low ph something that was also seen in ruminococcaceae cpb6 and its optimal growth ph of 5 5 6 zhu et al 2017 caproic acid and other mcca are known bacterial growth inhibitors desbois and smith 2010 royce et al 2013 and for instance the growth rate of m elsdenii drops by approx 70 when exposed to 20 mm valeric or caproic acid at ph 5 9 weimer and moen 2013 similar to concentrations obtained here lastly the thermodynamic analysis fig 5 showed that caproic acid production becomes more exergonic with decreasing ph however the consistently lower δg1 r of propionic acid production under the conditions analyzed indicates thermodynamics alone are not sufficient to explain the shift from propionic acid production to caproic acid production at lower ph from these observations we hypothesize that the combination of a more leveled energetic playing field at lower ph permits lactic acid chain elongators to find a niche in the system the production of c5 c7 carboxylic acids could then further inhibit propionic acid producing organisms strengthening the competitive advantage of lactic acid chain elongators this hypothesis also supports the different communities observed at ph 6 after coming from either ph 5 5 or ph 6 5 fig 3 b when transitioning from ph 5 5 to ph 6 the pre existing high c6 concentrations could have inhibited the propionic acid producers sufficiently to keep the community centered on chain elongation in the reverse case going from ph 6 5 to 6 the absence of caproic acid could have allowed propionic acid producers to remain dominant as their kinetics were still more favorable than those of chain elongators 4 2 the ecology of lactic acid fermentations and its influence on the overall process above we analyzed drivers steering the competition between lactic acid utilizing propionic acid producers and chain elongators as a function of ph however the ongoing simultaneous presence of the two groups chain elongators represented by caproiciproducens and propionic acid producers represented by propionibacterium veillonella under constant operational conditions fig 3a implies there is an ongoing competition between the two groups and consequently there appears to be a niche for both types of organisms this could be due to the influence of product toxicity on kinetics growth rates are linearly reduced with increasing concentrations of caproic acid and other mcca candry et al 2018 royce et al 2013 weimer and moen 2013 in ethanol driven chain elongation processes mcca resistant competing satellite communities have been observed roghair et al 2018 although unverified here it might be that caproiciproducens organisms are inhibited before all lactic acid is consumed enabling growth of more resistant but currently uncharacterized propionic acid producing organisms growing on residual lactic acid the competition between these two groups of organisms becomes important when considering in situ product recovery solvent based extraction methods enable selective mcca extraction from fermentation broths but require mildly acidic ph for efficient extraction agler et al 2012 lowering product concentrations in this way could give either group a kinetic advantage over the other and result in a community dominated by either propionic acid producers or chain elongators one study showed that in a lactic acid fed system applying in situ product extraction both groups continued to compete with approx 17 41 on mol e basis of the substrate ending up in caproic acid while 6 20 on mol e basis ended up in propionic acid kucek et al 2016 while that study concluded that low ph and in situ product extraction were required to obtain selective mcca production similar efficiencies were observed in this study without in situ product recovery 34 0 9 9 of e in caproic acid and 8 9 7 8 of e in propionic acid indicating there may be more at play similar observations were reported in two studies fermenting real streams to mcca in two stage systems one with and one without product extraction in the second stage both studies reported similar fractions of roughly 10 15 mol e basis propionic and valeric acid in the product khor et al 2017 xu et al 2018 interestingly in another study using dairy industry waste in a one phase system without product extraction less than 5 of the electrons consumed were lost to propionic acid bacteria duber et al 2018 unraveling the contribution of these different pathways in complex systems could help us understand how to steer systems more selectively towards caproic acid as the product 5 conclusion in this study we investigated the impact of ph on the product spectrum of lactic acid fermentations with open mixed communities and how different functional guilds are affected by changes in ph we observed that at ph higher than 6 the product spectrum shifted sharply from a mixture of predominantly butyric valeric and caproic acid to a mix of acetic and propionic acid the use of ph as a driving force towards chain elongation was confirmed when an identical mixture of butyric valeric and caproic acid was obtained as ph was lowered again below 6 this shift in product output was also observed in community structure with increased ph causing the community to shift from one primarily made up of caproiciproducens to one dominated by both veillonella and aminobacterium and back to caproiciproducens as ph lowered again simultaneously batch incubations were executed to assess the consumption and production rates and the effect of long and short term ph changes on these rates these experiments showed that i high ph 6 allow for higher lactic acid consumption rates and ii caproic acid can be produced at ph 6 5 but chain elongators are outcompeted by faster propionic acid producers we conclude here that the application of low ph during lactic acid fermentation favors chain elongators due to i the unfavorable kinetics of lactic acid to propionic acid fermentation at low ph and elevated concentrations of carboxylic acids with a five carbon chain or longer and ii lactic acid driven chain elongation becoming more exergonic with decreasing ph and closer to the energetics of propionic acid producers however low ph is not enough to completely exclude propionic acid producers from the community and more information is needed on how to steer the community further towards caproic acid to increase the efficiency and selectivity of these systems data

17562,carbohydrate rich waste streams can be used for bioproduction of medium chain carboxylic acids mcca such as caproic acid the carbohydrates in these streams can be converted to lactic acid as the initial fermentation product which can then be fermented to mcca by chain elongation in this process chain elongators compete for lactic acid with other bacterial groups that for instance ferment lactic acid to propionic and acetic acid understanding the drivers that control the competition between these two pathways is essential to maximizing mcca production this study aimed to investigate the competition between chain elongating and propionic acid producing organisms as a function of operational ph operation of long term lactic acid fermenting reactors with varying ph values showed that ph values above 6 resulted in a propionic acid producing community dominated by veillonella and aminobacterium at ph values below 6 the community moved towards chain elongation with communities dominated by caproiciproducens short term incubations showed that rates of lactic acid consumption were strongly reduced at ph below 6 7 7 1 2 mm lactic acid h 1 at ph 6 5 0 74 0 33 mm lactic acid h 1 at ph 5 5 similar to observations in long term reactors when a chain elongating community adapted to ph 5 5 was used for short term incubations at ph 6 5 propionic acid was the dominant product the results of this study show that ph below 6 stimulate lactic acid chain elongators through kinetic effects and potentially improved energetics providing a tool for microbial management of mcca producing systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioproduction chain elongation caproic acid lactic acid 1 introduction bioproduction of chemicals from organic rich waste and side streams is an attractive approach to valorize these costly to treat streams one product that has received much attention is caproic acid a six carbon medium chain carboxylic acid mcca with proposed applications as feed additive antibiotic substitute and corrosion inhibitor as well as feedstock for the production of fragrances flavors fuels and plasticizers chaincraft 2019 caproic acid can be produced microbially through a process called chain elongation in which an electron donor e g ethanol lactic acid sugars is used to increase the carbon chain length of a short chain carboxylic acid scca 2 to 5 carbon atom chain in two carbon increments steinbusch et al 2011 this metabolism named reverse beta oxidation was first studied in clostridium kluyveri an ethanol utilizing chain elongating organism barker and taha 1941 seedorf et al 2008 several studies have demonstrated the production of caproic acid from waste streams with ethanol as substrate for chain elongation agler et al 2012 grootscholten et al 2013 however these processes typically require the addition of exogeneous ethanol a significant contributor to the environmental impact chen et al 2017 and accounting for a large fraction of the process cost an alternative route for production of mcca from waste streams avoiding exogenous substrate additions is to use the carbohydrates embedded in the waste streams some organisms are capable of chain elongation with sugars as substrate jeon et al 2017 kim et al 2015 lanjekar et al 2014 willems and collins 1996 most mixed community systems observe both lactic acid producers e g lactobacillus olsenella and suspected lactic acid driven chain elongators andersen et al 2017 carvajal arroyo et al 2019 duber et al 2018 some reports have also physically separated the conversion of carbohydrates to lactic acid and subsequent conversion to caproic acid in two stage reactor systems khor et al 2017 xu et al 2018 while lactic acid driven caproic acid production fits well within the context of biorefineries and the valorization of carbohydrate rich waste streams there are additional aspects to be considered for instance product selectivity lactic acid serves as substrate for different competing secondary fermentative pathways fig 1 in reverse beta oxidation the first step of the pathway is the conversion of lactic acid to acetyl coa which can be condensed with another acetyl coa molecule to produce acetoacetyl coa this acetoacetyl coa is then converted to butyryl coa by transferring the coa group from butyryl coa to acetate butyric acid is produced while the acetyl coa can be reused in the reverse beta oxidation cycle alternatively another acetyl coa can be added to butyryl coa to yield caproyl coa and in turn caproic acid some members of clostridium can also elongate lactic acid to butyric acid without production of caproic acid these organisms do not use reverse beta oxidation but instead convert butyryl coa to butyric acid through phosphorylation because acetyl coa is not regenerated this pathway is linear rather than cyclical diez gonzalez et al 1995 ingham et al 1998 lastly lactic acid can also be converted to mixtures of propionic and acetic acid this can happen through two distinct pathways yielding the same products in the wood werkman cycle as present in propionibacterium acidipropionici lactic acid is first converted to pyruvate which is subsequently converted to succinate and then propionyl coa to ultimately yield propionic acid in other organisms for instance megasphaera elsdenii lactic acid is first dehydrated to acrylyl coa which is then reduced to propionyl coa and ultimately propionic acid both of these pathways require nadh for a reductive step in the metabolism which can be generated during the oxidation of lactic acid to acetic acid to maintain the electron balance parizzi et al 2012 prabhu et al 2012 while the metabolic pathways are relatively well understood there is less information about interactions between these functional guilds in this context ph is a key operational parameter that could critically affect these relationships and the resulting product profile ruminococcaceae cpb6 a bacterium producing caproic acid from lactic acid prefers mildly acidic ph i e 5 5 6 zhu et al 2017 propionibacterium species on the other hand have been shown to produce acetic acid and propionic acid from lactic acid at ph values of approx 6 5 7 luo et al 2017 while growth rates of propionibacterium acidipropionici drop rapidly below ph 6 lewis and yang 1992 m elsdenii is an outlier in this context it produces c2 c5 carboxylic acids from lactic acid and grows well at ph 6 5 7 2 but growth rates are highest around ph 5 5 6 and only begin to decrease when ph drops below 5 5 5 choi et al 2013 counotte and prins 1981 weimer and moen 2013 however these observations were made in pure cultures and may not translate to more complex mixed communities teague and weiss 2015 therefore it is important to investigate how ph will impact lactic acid driven fermentations in mixed communities harboring these different organisms in this study the competition between lactic acid utilizing organisms producing either propionic butyric or caproic acid was investigated by long term operation of mixed culture lactic acid fed systems at varying ph product profiles and community composition were analyzed to better understand the steering mechanism of ph additionally batch tests were performed at different ph to investigate the production and consumption rates of the considered groups of lactic acid consumers and how this contributes to their competition this resulted in further suggestions on how to stimulate lactic acid consuming caproic acid producers and how to steer lactic acid mediated processes towards more selective caproic acid production 2 materials methods 2 1 long term reactor operation two reactors were inoculated with a pre adapted lactic acid chain elongating culture which was originally enriched from a granular fermentation reactor converting a carbohydrate rich stream to caproic acid with lactic acid as an intermediate carvajal arroyo et al 2019 throughout all experiments a synthetic medium supplementary information s 1 1 was used that mimicked the salts composition of this carbohydrate rich waste stream but substituting sugars with 257 mm lactic acid as 60 na lactate syrup multi port reactors ochs glasgerätebau bovenden germany with a working volume of 900 ml were operated as continuous stirred tank reactors cstr with magnetic stirring

hcl maintained ph at the desired setpoint initially one reactor r1 was operated at ph 5 5 while the second reactor r2 was operated at ph 5 throughout the entire experiment r1 was kept at ph 5 5 while ph in r2 was gradually increased from 5 to 6 5 in increments of 0 5 ph units and back down to ph 5 table 1 keeping at least 3 5 hrt between changes in ph to ensure reaching a new steady state

later analysis of substrates and products at selected timepoints biomass samples were taken for cell quantification with flow cytometry these samples were first filtered over 20 µm filters bd biosciences erembodegem belgium before dilution in filtered evian water 2 2 short term incubations batch experiments were used to assess rates of lactic acid driven fermentations to understand the role of consumption and production rates in the competition between caproic acid and propionic acid producers batch experiments were conducted at ph between 5 and 6 5 using inocula acclimated to different ph batch experiments using inoculum of r1 i e fixed ph of 5 5 allowed monitoring of short term ph changes experiments inoculated with broth from r2 were used to investigate the effects of long term ph changes on substrate consumption and product formation rates of these communities multi port reactors ochs glasgerätebau bovenden germany with a total volume of 1 l were filled with 100 ml of basal medium 257 mm lactic acid corrected to the desired ph bottles were sparged with n2 co2 for at least 15 min before inoculation with 100 ml of freshly harvested inoculum an overview of each experiment with set ph and inoculum used is given in table 2 batch experiments were ph controlled by dosing of 2 m hcl with online ph controllers prominent belgium after inoculation reactors were incubated with magnetic stirring for 7 days in a temperature controlled room 34 c sampling twice daily for the first 5 days of the experiment and once on the final day samples were taken for measurement of od and substrate and product analyses after filtration 0 20 µm and storage 20 c at each timepoint acid consumption and gas production were monitored all batch experiments were performed in triplicate replicates showing no growth were removed from further analysis but all experiments had at least two replicates 2 3 calculations all errors reported in this study are standard deviations over all replicates n 2 3 substrate consumption and product formation rates during short term incubations were calculated as the slope of a linear regression over the linear phase of batch incubations

concentrations of soluble products were taken from the steady state product profile of r1 at ph 5 5 ii partial pressures of h2 ph2 and co2 in the headspace were assumed to be both 0 5 atm iii the concentration of hco3 was calculated from henry s law and the co2 hco3 equilibrium the full equations used for these calculations and thermodynamic data can be found in supplementary information section s 1 2 furthermore to assess the impact of ph2 on these different metabolisms alternative scenarios with a variation of 20 in ph2 i e ph2 of 0 4 and 0 6 atm were calculated 2 4 analytical

rarefaction was applied before analysis of the filtered data 3 results 3 1 long term lactic acid fermentation the long term effect of ph on lactic acid fermentation was investigated in two lactic acid fed cstrs at either fixed ph of 5 5 r1 or varying ph between 5 and 6 5 r2 fig 2 in r1 elongated products consistently dominated the product profile specifically butyric acid 22 8 10 5 mm 0 46 0 21 mol e l 1 valeric acid 30 16 11 45 mm 0 78 0 30 mol e l 1 and caproic acid 25 9 7 0 mm 0 83 0 22 mol e l 1 can be observed throughout the whole experimental period fig 2a shorter chain products were also consistently present in the product profile i e acetic acid 15 4 12 3 mm or 0 12 0 10 mol e l 1 and propionic acid 17 1 16 8 mm or 0 24 0 23 mol e l 1 additionally unconsumed lactic acid was transiently observed in the effluent of the reactor with variable concentrations in r2 the long term effect of varying ph was investigated by stepwise increasing ph from 5 to 6 5 in steps of 0 5 ph units followed by a stepwise decrease in ph down to ph 5 in phase i ph 5 table 1 the reactor community never achieved sufficiently high activity to consume all lactic acid over the steady state period in this phase table 1 caproic acid 19 3 7 6 mm 0 62 0 25 mol e l 1 was the main product fig 2b but a large fraction of lactic acid was left unconverted in the effluent 158 1 47 8 mm out of 257 mm 1 90 0 57 mol e l 1 out of 3 1 mol e 1 l 1 after switching to ph 5 5 phase ii nearly all lactic acid was consumed 6 9 11 8 mm 0 08 0 14 mol e l 1 in the effluent initially butyric acid was the main product up to 78 7 mm or 1 57 mol e l 1 day 49 but this switched to caproic acid later up to 74 0 mm or 2 37 mol e l 1 day 63 eventually the reactor stabilized with a product spectrum dominated by butyric acid 40 5 7 4 mm or 0 81 0 15 mol e l 1 and caproic acid 28 0 8 0 mm or 0 90 0 26 mol e l 1 increasing ph to 6 phase iii resulted in caproic acid 36 2 12 6 mm 1 16 0 40 mol e l 1 becoming dominant over butyric acid 15 5 6 1 mm 0 31 0 12 mol e l 1 as a product additionally shorter chain products acetic acid propionic acid started accumulating acetic acid from 7 3 2 7 mm or 0 06 0 02 mol e l 1 in phase ii to 11 2 0 8 mm or 0 09 0 01 mol e l 1 in phase iii propionic acid from 6 9 2 5 mm or 0 10 0 03 mol e l 1 to 23 3 12 1 mm or 0 33 0 17 mol e l 1 at ph 6 5 phase iv the product spectrum fully shifted to short chain products although at that ph sulfate reduction became problematic although sulfides were not quantified the amount of sulfate supplied means that at most 0 006 mol e l 1 could have been diverted towards sulfide negligible compared to the 3 1 mol e l 1 supplied as lactic acid to avoid issues with h2s toxicity sulfate concentrations were lowered from 0 11 g l 1 to 0 029 g l 1 on day 105 phase v after which the product profile stabilized acetic acid 102 6 4 8 mm 0 82 0 04 mol e l 1 and propionic acid 119 4 4 1 mm 1 67 0 06 mol e l 1 dominated the product profile while concentrations of caproic acid were negligible 1 0 0 0 mm 0 03 0 00 mol e l 1 when ph was reduced down to 6 again phase vi production of acetic acid and propionic acid dropped sharply 19 9 19 2 mm or 0 16 0 15 mol e l 1 and 59 7 9 3 mm or 0 84 0 13 mol e l 1 respectively while butyric acid became the dominant product 66 4 10 0 mm 1 33 0 20 mol e l 1 further reducing the ph to 5 5 phase vii initially led to a similar profile but switched to a new steady state in which caproic acid became more dominant 32 6 6 6 mm 1 04 0 20 mol e l 1 while acetic and propionic concentrations dropped 23 0 6 7 mm or 0 18 0 05 mol e l 1 and 34 7 9 1 mm or 0 49 0 13 mol e l 1 respectively closely resembling the output at ph 5 5 in phase ii day 44 83 when lowering ph back to the original ph of 5 phase viii it could be seen that caproic acid concentrations remained close to those at ph 5 5 30 0 8 4 mm 0 96 0 27 mol e l 1 while concentrations of shorter products dropped further acetic acid 5 3 3 6 mm or 0 04 0 03 mol e l 1 propionic acid 9 1 11 3 mm or 0 13 0 16 mol e l 1 and butyric and valeric acid were instead the second and third product 31 3 5 0 mm or 0 63 0 10 mol e l 1 20 0 1 1 mm or 0 52 0 03 mol e l 1 3 2 impact of ph on community composition community structure was analyzed to test the hypothesis that mildly acidic ph would lead to the enrichment of chain elongators fig 3 in r1 the community was initially dominated by veillonella but shifted to propionibacterium both of which are known propionic acid producers parizzi et al 2012 rogosa 1964 and eventually caproiciproducens a genus characterized by one type species capable of caproic acid production kim et al 2015 in r2 the varying ph caused clear shifts in relative abundances of community members caproiciproducens classified otus were the most abundant 67 8 genus in the community fig 3b as ph increased to 6 tyzzerella became more abundant in the community above ph 6 however the community became almost exclusively composed of veillonella and aminobacterium with only a minimal caproiciproducens presence 2 0 while veillonella is known to generate propionic acid from lactic acid rogosa 1964 an isolate of aminobacterium a colombiense can grow on amino acids but not on lactic acid baena et al 1998 when ph was lowered back to 6 the abundance of aminobacterium lowered giving way to clostridium sensu stricto lowering ph to 5 5 allowed the recovery of caproiciproducens eventually becoming the most abundant genus in the community at ph 5 65 6 these community shifts from caproiciproducens to veillonella and back again closely reflect the shifts in product profile fig 2 and active pathways supplementary information s 2 1 observed in the system these trends were also validated by absolute taxon abundance with flow cytometry showing that trends were not influenced by changes in total cell concentration supplementary information s 2 3 3 3 short term effect of ph on lactic acid fermentation exploring how short term ph changes affect the product profile could give information on what role consumption and production rates play in the competition between chain elongators and propionic acid producers this was done by batch incubations of communities from r1 and r2 at ph between 5 and 6 5 at ph 6 5 rates of lactic acid consumption for r2 inoculated experiments were an order of magnitude higher than those at ph 5 5 92 0 14 0 mm e h 1 compared to 9 0 4 0 mm e h 1 fig 4 biomass concentrations were not quantified during these experiments but od in the reactor when the batch incubations were started was 3 07 at ph 5 5 and 3 26 at ph 6 5 supplementary information figure s 4 the amount of biomass inoculated in the system was in the same order of magnitude and the change in activity was not an artefact due to varying biomass concentrations similarly lactic acid consumption rates in r1 inoculated experiments increased from 12 6 7 8 mm e h 1 at ph 5 5 to 48 4 4 4 mm e h 1 at ph 6 5 a second observation is the dependence of product profiles on both incubation ph and inoculum fig 4 and supplementary information section s 2 5 at ph 6 5 incubations of the adapted r2 community exclusively resulted in acetic and propionic acid as products on the other hand the unadapted r1 community still produced valeric 4 7 0 8 mm e 1 h 1 and caproic acid 4 9 2 6 mm e 1 h1 although to a lesser extent than e g at ph 6 6 4 0 7 mm e 1 h 1 valeric acid 9 7 0 0 mm e 1 h 1 caproic acid interestingly the adapted community r2 at ph 6 produced only butyric acid and propionic acid this reflects what happens in the reactor at that point in time as the switch back to caproic acid production only happened when ph was lowered further to 5 5 3 4 thermodynamics of lactic acid driven fermentations to assess how thermodynamics may influence competition between propionic acid producers and chain elongators we analyzed the effect of ph on the energy released during fermentation at different phs i e δg1 r fig 5 it can be observed that δg1 r of acetic and propionic production from lactic acid is unaffected by ph and remains constant at 49 9 kj mol lactic acid 1 at ph 6 5 energy generation for butyric acid production 36 3 kj mol lactic acid 1 and caproic acid 42 6 kj mol lactic acid 1 is lower than that for propionic acetic fermentation however the thermodynamics of these pathways are affected by ph with lower δg1 r so more energy released at lower ph the slope is stronger for caproic acid production 3 9 kj mol lactic acid 1 per ph unit than for butyric acid 2 9 kj mol lactic acid 1 per ph unit and eventually caproic acid becomes more favorable than acetic propionic acid fermentation below ph 4 52 while this is below ph 4 5 for butyric acid production the impact of h2 on δg1 r for these different reactions was assessed by varying ph2 with 20 around the assumed value 0 5 atm within the tested range the impact of ph2 is limited and ph has a stronger impact on δg1 r for production of butyric and caproic acid 4 discussion 4 1 why does low ph favor lactic acid chain elongators a clear conclusion that can be made from this study is that mildly acidic phs lower than 6 are favorable for the lactic acid chain elongating organisms present in this enrichment culture this observation is consistent with previous reports ruminococcaceae cpb6 the only isolated lactic acid chain elongator so far has been shown to grow optimally between ph 5 5 and 6 zhu et al 2017 while a reactor with in line extraction and fed with a mixture of lactic acid and butyric acid showed improved selectivity for caproic acid production by lowering ph to 5 kucek et al 2016 we show here that the observation of caproic acid production at low ph for the community obtained here is replicable even after losing chain elongation activity at high ph caproiciproducens was initially the most abundant genus in the r2 community at ph 5 5 when ph was increased to 6 5 for 40 days 10 hrt srt product output switched to pure acetic and propionic acid production and the community became enriched in the propionic acid producing veillonella when ph was lowered back to 5 caproic acid production completely recovered with caproiciproducens as the most abundant genus this observation shows there is a strong driver for organisms to favor chain elongation over propionic acid fermentation at mildly acidic ph based on the data reported here we can explore the competition between propionic acid producers and chain elongators kinetics and thermodynamics are two potential drivers creating competitive advantages for one functional guild over another the production and consumption rates fig 4 and thermodynamic calculations fig 5 reported here can indicate how these two factors can create competitive advantages acetic and propionic acid production releases more energy than caproic acid production at neutral ph fig 5 additionally the rates of acetic and propionic acid production are higher as evidenced by acetic and propionic acid being the dominant products when incubating a community producing caproic acid ph 5 5 at ph 6 5 fig 4 these observations indicate that an open culture fermentation of lactic acid at circumneutral ph will inherently move towards production of acetic and propionic acid chain elongation activity was observed at higher ph during short term incubation but was lost in the long term reactor this further indicates lactic acid chain elongators in this system were outcompeted by propionic acid producers which would preclude a long term open culture bioproduction processes from lactic acid at ph 6 5 when lowering ph the advantage shifts to chain elongating organisms as shown by the switch in product spectrum from a mixture of acetic and propionic acid to a mixture of c4 c6 carboxylic acids fig 2 additionally analysis of the contribution of different pathways in the system demonstrated that chain elongation consumed most lactic acid at ph 5 5 supplementary information s 2 1 mildly acidic ph 6 0 incubations were consistently slower than incubations at high ph 6 5 fig 4 this only shows that rates of chain elongation at low ph are slower than those of acetic propionic acid production at neutral ph however there is information missing on the rates of propionic acid producers at low ph for p acidipropionici converting lactic acid to acetic and propionic acid it has been shown that its growth rate on lactic acid is severely affected by low ph dropping from 0 097 h 1 at ph 7 to 0 027 h 1 at ph 5 5 hsu and yang 1991 lewis and yang 1992 while the maximum growth rate of m elsdenii producing c2 c5 carboxylic acids from lactic acid is approx 0 4 h 1 at a ph of 5 5 only dropping sharply below ph 5 counotte and prins 1981 this indicates caproic acid producers might have a kinetic advantage at low ph something that was also seen in ruminococcaceae cpb6 and its optimal growth ph of 5 5 6 zhu et al 2017 caproic acid and other mcca are known bacterial growth inhibitors desbois and smith 2010 royce et al 2013 and for instance the growth rate of m elsdenii drops by approx 70 when exposed to 20 mm valeric or caproic acid at ph 5 9 weimer and moen 2013 similar to concentrations obtained here lastly the thermodynamic analysis fig 5 showed that caproic acid production becomes more exergonic with decreasing ph however the consistently lower δg1 r of propionic acid production under the conditions analyzed indicates thermodynamics alone are not sufficient to explain the shift from propionic acid production to caproic acid production at lower ph from these observations we hypothesize that the combination of a more leveled energetic playing field at lower ph permits lactic acid chain elongators to find a niche in the system the production of c5 c7 carboxylic acids could then further inhibit propionic acid producing organisms strengthening the competitive advantage of lactic acid chain elongators this hypothesis also supports the different communities observed at ph 6 after coming from either ph 5 5 or ph 6 5 fig 3 b when transitioning from ph 5 5 to ph 6 the pre existing high c6 concentrations could have inhibited the propionic acid producers sufficiently to keep the community centered on chain elongation in the reverse case going from ph 6 5 to 6 the absence of caproic acid could have allowed propionic acid producers to remain dominant as their kinetics were still more favorable than those of chain elongators 4 2 the ecology of lactic acid fermentations and its influence on the overall process above we analyzed drivers steering the competition between lactic acid utilizing propionic acid producers and chain elongators as a function of ph however the ongoing simultaneous presence of the two groups chain elongators represented by caproiciproducens and propionic acid producers represented by propionibacterium veillonella under constant operational conditions fig 3a implies there is an ongoing competition between the two groups and consequently there appears to be a niche for both types of organisms this could be due to the influence of product toxicity on kinetics growth rates are linearly reduced with increasing concentrations of caproic acid and other mcca candry et al 2018 royce et al 2013 weimer and moen 2013 in ethanol driven chain elongation processes mcca resistant competing satellite communities have been observed roghair et al 2018 although unverified here it might be that caproiciproducens organisms are inhibited before all lactic acid is consumed enabling growth of more resistant but currently uncharacterized propionic acid producing organisms growing on residual lactic acid the competition between these two groups of organisms becomes important when considering in situ product recovery solvent based extraction methods enable selective mcca extraction from fermentation broths but require mildly acidic ph for efficient extraction agler et al 2012 lowering product concentrations in this way could give either group a kinetic advantage over the other and result in a community dominated by either propionic acid producers or chain elongators one study showed that in a lactic acid fed system applying in situ product extraction both groups continued to compete with approx 17 41 on mol e basis of the substrate ending up in caproic acid while 6 20 on mol e basis ended up in propionic acid kucek et al 2016 while that study concluded that low ph and in situ product extraction were required to obtain selective mcca production similar efficiencies were observed in this study without in situ product recovery 34 0 9 9 of e in caproic acid and 8 9 7 8 of e in propionic acid indicating there may be more at play similar observations were reported in two studies fermenting real streams to mcca in two stage systems one with and one without product extraction in the second stage both studies reported similar fractions of roughly 10 15 mol e basis propionic and valeric acid in the product khor et al 2017 xu et al 2018 interestingly in another study using dairy industry waste in a one phase system without product extraction less than 5 of the electrons consumed were lost to propionic acid bacteria duber et al 2018 unraveling the contribution of these different pathways in complex systems could help us understand how to steer systems more selectively towards caproic acid as the product 5 conclusion in this study we investigated the impact of ph on the product spectrum of lactic acid fermentations with open mixed communities and how different functional guilds are affected by changes in ph we observed that at ph higher than 6 the product spectrum shifted sharply from a mixture of predominantly butyric valeric and caproic acid to a mix of acetic and propionic acid the use of ph as a driving force towards chain elongation was confirmed when an identical mixture of butyric valeric and caproic acid was obtained as ph was lowered again below 6 this shift in product output was also observed in community structure with increased ph causing the community to shift from one primarily made up of caproiciproducens to one dominated by both veillonella and aminobacterium and back to caproiciproducens as ph lowered again simultaneously batch incubations were executed to assess the consumption and production rates and the effect of long and short term ph changes on these rates these experiments showed that i high ph 6 allow for higher lactic acid consumption rates and ii caproic acid can be produced at ph 6 5 but chain elongators are outcompeted by faster propionic acid producers we conclude here that the application of low ph during lactic acid fermentation favors chain elongators due to i the unfavorable kinetics of lactic acid to propionic acid fermentation at low ph and elevated concentrations of carboxylic acids with a five carbon chain or longer and ii lactic acid driven chain elongation becoming more exergonic with decreasing ph and closer to the energetics of propionic acid producers however low ph is not enough to completely exclude propionic acid producers from the community and more information is needed on how to steer the community further towards caproic acid to increase the efficiency and selectivity of these systems data

17563,plasticizer pollution in drinking water and aquatic systems has raised global concerns due to the lasting and chronic hazards to marine life and public health metal free materials are promising as green catalysts for wastewater purification in this study amorphous boron was applied as a metal free activator to decompose peroxymonosulfate pms for the degradation of plasticizers in water integrating radical trapping and selectively quenching tests with kinetic evaluation and electrochemical analysis hydroxyl radical was found to be the dominating reactive oxygen species ros with a strong oxidative capacity the boron pms system can effectively degrade both bisphenols and phthalates plasticizers in contrast a carbon nanotube catalyzed pms system mediated a nonradical pathway to oxidize the electron rich plasticizer bisphenol a but ineffectively to decompose the highly recalcitrant phthalates plasticizers diethyl phthalate moreover we unveiled that the boron surface was oxidized to boron oxide during the redox reaction and the oxide would be self cleaned in the acidic solution to regenerate fresh boron and restore the activity during the cyclic operations therefore this work not only gains new insights into the radical and nonradical oxidations by metal free catalysis but also provides feasible technologies for plasticizer purification in water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords plasticizer peroxymonosulfate boron metal free catalysis hydroxyl radicals 1 introduction the plastic industry has been booming in recent decades and the global annual production of plastics has already increased to 360 million tons in 2018 rapp et al 2020 plasticizers are indispensable chemical additives and their composition may overpass 85 in some plastic products bui et al 2016 however improper uses of plastic products may lead to the release of plasticizers into the aquatic surroundings as persistent water pollutants the frequent exposure to plasticizers has potential harmful effects on the endocrine systems of aquatic lives and human beings including developmental retardation immunologic derangement neurodevelopmental problems reproductive hormone abnormalities and cancers luo et al 2018 sheikh et al 2016 in order to control the plastic pollution some regulations on the production and use of plasticizers especially for phthalates paes and bisphenols bps have come into force in many countries larsson et al 2017 luo et al 2018 unfortunately paes and bps are still frequently detected in drinking water due to their chemical durability and biological recalcitrance ding et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 persulfate based advanced oxidation processes ps aops are effective technologies by producing a series of reactive oxygen species ros for the degradation of aqueous microcontaminants such as plasticizers ren et al 2015 wang et al 2015 antibiotics cao et al 2019 kang et al 2016 and dyes long et al 2019 zhu et al 2018b in general the peroxide o o bond of peroxymonosulfate pms can be activated and cleaved into sulfate radical so4 e 0 3 1 v vs normal hydrogen electrode nhe or hydroxyl radical oh e 0 2 7 v vs nhe by thermal treatment ultraviolet irradiation electrochemistry alkalis metal or metal free catalysts ghanbari and moradi 2017 kang et al 2019 oh et al 2016 wang and wang 2018 among these activation methods metal free ps aops have been intensively investigated due to elemental abundance high efficiency and environmental friendliness chen et al 2018 duan et al 2018c qi et al 2020 yu et al 2020 zhao et al 2017 boron and carbon have been reported as effective metal free catalysts for pms activation but the ros and reaction pathways in the two systems are discrepant due to the distinct ground state electronic configuration of boron 1s2 2s2 2p1 and carbon 1s2 2s2 2p2 specifically the o o bond of pms was cleaved by sp3 hybridized nanodiamond to generate free radicals whereas the graphitized nanodiamond sp2 sp3 activated pms to produce surface reactive complexes duan et al 2018a similarly graphitic carbon nanotube cnt effectively activated pms to form nonradical complexes which directly attacked the electron rich pollutants via electron transfer ren et al 2020a although boron and carbon are neighboring nonmetals in the periodic table boron with one single electron in the 2p orbital endows it metallic properties to coordinate a radical process during the interaction with pms shao et al 2017 moreover density functional theory dft illustrated that the oso3 part of pms ho oso3 was more likely to accept an electron from boron to generate oh and so4 2 duan et al 2019 however due to the limited research on boron chemistry the underlining mechanism is unclear and the poor stability of boron needs to be addressed in practical applications in the recent studies on ps aops the emerging nonradical oxidation pathways such as singlet oxygenation and electron transfer process exhibit high selectivity toward electron rich pollutants and bacteria in water purification duan et al 2018b guan et al 2017 ho et al 2019 hu et al 2017 su et al 2020 nitrogen doped cnt n cnt would react with pms to form n cnt pms complexes which attacked phenols via an electron transfer pathway duan et al 2015 ren et al 2020a however the oxidation potential of the system was mild and the electron migration regime was ineffective for the removal of electron deficient contaminants in contrast oh would non selectively react with most organics at high rate constants 106 to 1010 m 1s 1 lee et al 2020 amorphous boron is a metal free catalyst to evolve free radicals in ps aops systems for the degradation of various organics duan et al 2019 electron rich bisphenols plasticizers such as bisphenol a bpa and bisphenol s bps could be oxidized via either radical or nonradical pathway su et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 however the highly recalcitrant phthalates plasticizers including dimethyl phthalate dmp diethyl phthalate dep and dibutyl phthalate dbp could only be degraded by radical ros an et al 2014 ren et al 2016 the removal efficiency of plasticizers not only relies on the species and quantity of ros but also on the kinetics between the ros and plasticizers in this study amorphous boron was used as metal free catalysts to activate pms for the oxidation of plasticizers quenching experiment kinetics calculation electrochemical analysis electron spin resonance esr and in situ raman spectra were applied to reveal the oxidation pathways of bisphenols and phthalates plasticizers in the boron pms system as well as comparisons with the nonradical n cnt pms system more importantly the mechanism of boron based pms activation was unveiled via x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps x ray diffraction xrd raman spectra and transmission electron microscopy tem the natural background factors were also investigated for the application of the boron pms system in real water treatment 2

ultimate 3000 high performance liquid chromatograph hplc with a c 18 column the leaching concentration of boron was measured by an agilent 8900x triple quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms residual concentrations of pms were determined by the spectrophotometry approach with the co addition of potassium iodide and sodium bicarbonate liang et al 2008 hydrogen evolution was sampled in an airtight container and analyzed by a microgc 490 gas chromatograph gc 3 results and discussion 3 1 the active species of boron pms system the activity of boron was assessed for pms activation toward dep degradation as shown in fig 1 a inconspicuous removal of dep 2 0 was observed with the sole presence of boron or pms indicating that dep elimination by boron adsorption and direct oxidation by pms was insufficient however the removal efficiency of dep was dramatically increased to 95 0 once boron and pms were mixed suggesting that more effective ros were generated meanwhile the catalytic activity of the reaction system was improved gradually with the increased dosage of boron 0 0 5 g l fig s1 and pms 0 3 0 mm fig s2 the optimal initial concentrations for boron and pms were determined as 0 2 g l and 3 0 mm respectively in order to investigate the evolution and species of ros involved in the boron pms system a series of techniques such as radical trapping and visualization by esr selectively ros quenching in situ raman spectroscopy and on line open circuit potential monitoring were used to identify the radical and nonradical processes fig 1b depicts that no obvious signal was observed in the presence of boron alone while quartet characteristic peaks of dmpo oh with intensity ratios of 1 2 2 1 were captured with the addition of pms alone however the signals of pms alone were weak suggesting that pms itself without activation could not generate large numbers of ros for dep oxidation fig 1a much stronger signals of dmpo oh were observed in the presence of boron and pms indicating that a myriad of hydroxyl radicals were generated in the pms boron system which contributed to the rapid degradation of dep to quantitatively determine the formation of hydroxyl radicals in the boron pms and pms alone systems we adopted a fluorescence method using coumarin as a trap agent ren et al 2016 although the fluorescence intensity gradually increased with prolonged reaction time in both the systems fig s3 the accumulated fluorescence intensity of boron pms was 30 times higher than that of pms alone in 60 min fig 1c the results suggest that hydroxyl radicals were generated in both systems and the radical yield in the boron pms system was much higher than pms alone system which coincides with the results of dep degradation and epr spectra in the boron pms system since sulfate radicals are typical ros in ps aops systems radical scavenging experiments with meoh and tba were conducted to evaluate the contributions of oh and so4 as shown in fig 2 a the removal of dep was almost impeded with either meoh or tba suggesting that oh played a vital role in the degradation of dep however it does not mean that no so4 was generated in the boron pms system this is because dep oxidation depends on the quantity of radicals as well as the reaction kinetics between the radicals and dep it was reported that the second order rate constant for the reaction of dep with oh k dep oh 3 7 109 m 1s 1 is 60 times higher than that with so4 k dep so4 6 4 107 m 1s 1 wang et al 2018b hence the insignificant contribution of so4 in dep oxidation might be due to the much lower k dep so4 than k dep oh in order to verify the assumption a bisphenol plasticizer bpa was employed as another target pollutant because the second order rate constant of bpa with so4 k bpa so4 1 4 109 m 1s 1 is much higher than dep k dep so4 6 4 107 m 1s 1 sanchez polo et al 2013 and the generated alcohol radicals such as ch2oh eqs 1 and 2 and ch2 ch3 2coh eqs 3 and 4 cannot degrade phenols in the pds alcohol system zhu et al 2018a therefore the contribution of so4 would be more significant in bpa degradation in the presence of meoh or tba kong et al 2019 as shown in fig 2b the quenching effect of tba was limited and bpa removal decreased from 92 2 to 62 6 after the addition of meoh bpa removal dropped to 7 8 suggesting that both oh and so4 were produced in the boron pms system meanwhile two benchmark radical systems of ag pds so4 eq 5 and fe2 h2o2 oh eq 6 were evaluated anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 as illustrated in fig 2c f so4 the ag pds system could effectively decompose bpa but demonstrated a poor oxidation capacity toward dep whereas oh the fe2 h2o2 system exhibited a superior activity in the degradation of both dep and bpa the discrepant oxidation results are related to their individual second order rate constants k bpa so4 k dep so4 k bpa oh and k dep oh of the radicals so4 and oh with plasticizers bpa and dep k bpa so4 1 4 109 m 1s 1 is about two orders of magnitude higher than k dep so4 6 4 107 m 1s 1 whereas both k bpa oh 1 7 1010 m 1s 1 and k dep oh 3 7 109 m 1s 1 overpass 109 m 1s 1 which are greater than most of reaction rate constants between ros and organics lee et al 2020 sanchez polo et al 2013 wang et al 2018b 1 so 4 c h 3 oh c h 2 oh so 4 2 h 2 oh c h 3 oh c h 2 oh h 2 o 3 so 4 c h 3 3 coh c h 2 c h 3 2 oh so 4

established nonradical oxidation system via an electron transfer regime duan et al 2018c ren et al 2020a as shown in fig 2g the removal rate of dep with n cnt alone was similar to the rate with the co addition of n cnt and pms suggesting that most of dep was removed by adsorption dep could not be degraded by the nonradical pathway due to the relatively low redox potential and specific selectivity to electron rich substrates in contrast the n cnt pms system exhibited a fast removal of bpa and the addition of meoh presented unapparent inhibition fig 2h illustrating that bpa can be oxidized by the nonradical process in the n cnt pms system moreover solvent exchange experiment water to deuteroxide was applied to assess the contribution of singlet oxygen 1o2 because 1o2 possesses a much longer lifetime in deuteroxide d2o solvent than water h2o bregnhoj et al 2016 gao et al 2020 the oxidation kinetics of bpa was not enhanced in both boron pms fig 2b and n cnt pms fig 2h systems when exchanging the solvent from h2o to d2o suggesting the ineffectiveness of singlet oxygenation in the two systems to further probe the pms activation mechanism by metal free boron the open circuit potentials of the catalysts was in real time monitored during the pms activation as demonstrated in fig 3 the potential of boron climbed from 0 209 to 0 305 v reaching a new equilibrium potential with the addition of pms the addition of bpa or dep had little interference on the equilibrium potential inset fig 3 illustrating that there was no electron transfer process directly from the organics bpa and dep to boron or surface activated pms during the degradation of the organics in comparison the potential of n cnt sharply raised in the addition of pms and then the potential decreased upon the addition of bpa in contrast the addition of dep did not cause a decline in the potential the results suggest that bpa could be oxidized by carbon driven nonradical oxidation while n cnt pms was incapable of oxidizing dep which is accorded with the oxidation kinetics in fig 2g and 2h moreover in situ raman spectroscopy was applied to compare the interaction of pms with boron and n cnt fig 4 demonstrates that a new peak of activated pms pms emerged at around 835 cm 1 after the addition of cnt into pms solution while no new peak appeared for boron the results illustrate that different from n cnt pms to produce surface confined intermediates ren et al 2020a boron may directly transfer electrons to pms to release radicals into the solution for homogeneous oxidation notably boron is an insulating and reductive element which was capable of offering electrons to pms for the direct cleavage of the peroxide o o bond into radicals duan et al 2019 3 2 the effect of ph ph value is a crucial parameter in practical water treatment and the effects of initial ph ph0 on the degradations of dep and bpa were investigated in the boron pms system the removal efficiencies of dep were 95 0 51 7 24 5 and 1 2 at ph0 of 3 0 4 0 5 0 and 7 0 respectively fig 5 a similarly the removal rates of bpa fig s4 and the consumption of pms fig s5 decreased with the increased solution ph0 thus pms activation on boron was favorable at acidic conditions furthermore the leaching concentrations of boron remarkably increased from 0 17 to 0 95 mg l 1 at ph0 of 3 0 and increased from 0 15 to 0 52 mg l 1 at ph0 of 5 0 after the addition of pms respectively fig s6 however the equivalent or more boric acid 0 2 mg l 1 fig s7 had a limited contribution to the dep degradation revealing that the leaching boric ions could not decompose pms into radicals and the ph might affect the properties of the interfacial boron zeta potential was measured to investigate the electrostatic interactions between pms and boron surface the zeta potential of boron surface gradually decreased with increased ph fig s8 suggesting that the adsorption of pms onto the boron surface became more difficult while solution ph changed from acidic to neutral conditions on the other hand in situ raman was applied to monitor the evolution of surface boron chemistry at different phs as shown in fig 5b the intensity of b o bond became stronger at increased solution ph0 indicating that boron oxides were formed on boron which covered the reductive boron surface and caused the passivation during the pms activation therefore surface boron atoms would experience hydroxylation reactions in the neutral or alkaline solution the negative zeta potential of boron surface enhanced its electrostatic interactions with pms meanwhile the active sites of boron were occupied by oxygen atoms resulting in the inhibited interactions of boron and pms to generate radicals 3 3 kinetic calculation the concentrations of radicals were computed according to the kinetic calculations text s3 the degradation of dep and bpa by the boron pms system followed a pseudo first order kinetic model and their degradation processes were expressed as eq 7 the effective ros were hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical without nonradical based on the results of 3 1 part and their corresponding degradation processes were represented in a simplified kinetic model as eq 8 moreover eq 9 was then deduced by substituting eq 7 in eq 8 chen et al 2019 7 ln c c 0 k obs c t 8 d c d t k c oh o h c k c so 4 s o 4 c 9 k obs c t k c oh o h d t k c so 4 s o 4

k obs dep k bpa oh k obs bpa k dep oh k bpa oh k dep so 4 k dep oh k bpa so 4 the k obs dep and k obs bpa were obtained from kinetic experiments for the degradation of dep and bpa fig s9 respectively the values of oh ave and so4 ave at different phs were calculated by eqs 12 and 13 the results show that oh ave 2 34 10 13 m was about 2 5 times as high as that of so4 ave 9 29 10 14 m at ph0 3 0 reflecting that oh was more likely to be generated in the boron pms system the kinetics computations suggest that the electrons from boron were inclined to migrate to the oii so3 in pms h oi oii so3 resulting in the generation of oh and so4 2 moreover when ph0 was adjusted from 3 0 to 5 0 oh ave and so4 ave were decreased by 10 times to 2 07 10 14 m and 7 92 10 15 m respectively the result suggests that the inhibited degradation at higher ph0 was due to the inadequate concentration of radicals in the boron pms moreover the accuracy of the calculated values oh ave and so4 ave was verified by a separate test taking another plasticizer dibutyl phthalate dbp as a testing compound its rate constants k dbp oh and k dbp so 4 are 6 3 109 and 1 2 108 m 1s 1 respectively wang et al 2018a the pseudo first order kinetic model based on the calculated kinetic constant k cal dbp of 1 48 10 3 s 1 text s3 could well fit the experimental data at ph0 3 0 fig s10 confirming that the kinetics calculation was feasible in the mechanistic study on radical quenching experiments the use of inappropriate scavengers may lead to a biased verdict for example superfluous scavengers would affect the adsorption of an organic or oxidant on the catalyst to slowdown the reaction rather than selectively quench the target ros ren et al 2020b additionally some quenchers are less selective and also react with the oxidant directly cheng et al 2019 ren et al 2019 yun et al 2018 herein computation was established to examine the feasibility of scavengers in the quenching experiments according to the theoretical assumption and formula derivation text s4 the calculative equation was expressed as eq 14 14 k c q f oh c q k c oh t oh d t f so 4 c q k c so 4 t so 4 d t where k c q represents the first order rate constants of target pollutant in the presence of a quencher f oh c q and f so4 c q represent the proportions of oh and so4 reacting with the target pollutant in the presence of the quenching agent respectively matzek et al 2018 taking bpa degradation for an example the calculative equations of kinetics for quenching reactions by tba and meoh were obtained as eqs 15 and 16 the value of k cal bpa tba was calculated to be 5 58 10 4 s 1 which was close to the observed value of k obs bpa tba 3 88 10 4 s 1 fig s11 in the quenching experiment of tba moreover the relative deviation between the calculated value of k cal bpa meoh 6 16 10 5 s 1 and the observed value of k obs bpa meoh 7 14 10 5 s 1 fig s11 was 13 7 in the presence of meoh suggesting that tba and meoh were the suitable scavengers to selectively screen oh and so4 accordingly during bpa degradation by the boron pms system therefore the calculated rate constants are conducive to judge the targeted or untargeted roles of scavengers in the radical quenching experiment the results of relative deviation between the calculated and observed values will provide a valid way to screen the optimal quenchers in an unknow system which can further improve the accuracy of the proposed mechanism 15 k cal bpa tba f oh bpa tba k bpa oh t oh d t f so 4 bpa tba k bpa so 4 t so 4 d t 16 k cal bpa meoh f oh bpa meoh k bpa oh t oh d t f so 4 bpa meoh k bpa so 4 t so 4 d t where k cal bpa tba and k cal bpa meoh represent the calculated first order rate constants of bpa in the presences of tba and meoh in the boron pms system in addition hydrogen evolution via the hydrolysis of metalloid boron eq 17 at high temperature is an efficient and promising energy technology compared to zero valent metals such as aluminum magnesium iron and zinc wahbeh et al 2012 in this work hydrogen evolution was measured to estimate the surface activity of boron at different phs as demonstrated in fig 5c the yields of hydrogen at ph0 of 3 0 and 5 0 were 14 4 and 5 9 μmol h 1g 1 accordingly in the pms boron system however no hydrogen was observed with the addition of boron alone ph0 of 3 0 pms alone ph0 of 3 0 or the co presence of boron and pms ph0 of 7 0 the results suggest that the acidic environment and the co existence of pms are the prerequisites for hydrogen evolution over amorphous boron the process of hydrogen evolution could be relevant to the generation of so4 and oh because the oi h part of pms h oi oii so3 was more likely to bond with h to produce oi h h through hydrogen bond meanwhile the catalyst would further provide electrons to oi h h via the breakup of oi h and reduction of h for hydrogen evolution zhang et al 2020 the gap between the yield of h2 0 17 μm and the total consumption of pms 9 60 μm fig s5 was about 56 times in difference suggesting that most of pms were decomposed to generate oh but only a small portion of pms was consumed for the production of so4 or hydrogen evolution 17 2 b 3 h 2 o 3 h 2 b 2 o 3 3 4 reaction mechanism of the boron pms system the cyclic performances of boron were evaluated the removal rate of dep gradually declined from 95 0 to 70 7 after the fourth use fig 5d and the leaching concentrations of boron were correspondingly decreased from 0 95 to 0 52 mg l 1 fig s12 implying that the slight surface passivation of boron in the multiple uses however the catalytic activity of the deactivated boron was recovered after acid washing and the leaching concentration raised to 1 22 mg l 1 suggesting that the acid treatment cleaned the inactive boron oxide to expose more fresh boron on the surface for pms activation since addition of pms typically would induce a decline of solution ph to around 3 0 table s2 the good stability of boron in the four cycles may be attributed to the partial self cleaning during the reaction with pms to investigate the evolution of surface boron during the pms activation we analyzed the surface chemical species and contents of boron by xps as shown in fig 6 a c the b1s peak can be fitted into three components at the binding energies of 187 72 188 52 and 191 98 ev attributed to b b boron suboxide and b2o3 respectively moddeman et al 1989 ongi et al 2004 a new peak of b2o3 was observed on the surface of used boron and it vanished after acid washing suggesting that b2o3 was the oxidative product of boron during pms activation and an acid treatment was conductive to the removal of inactive b2o3 on the surface of boron in addition this phenomenon was also confirmed by raman analysis and tem imaging a distinct new peak emerged at around 920 cm 1 on the used boron fig s13 which was ascribed to the bending vibrations of b o bond of b2o3 li et al 1995 moreover the peak intensity of b o bond was weaker after acid treatment for the used boron hydroxylated surface boron was the active site for ferric reduction and thus tetrahydroxydiboron thdb was used as a model molecule to simulate the reactivity of boron intermediate zhou et al 2020 unfortunately dep could not be removed by thdb pms figure s14 suggesting that surface hydroxylation of boron inhibited pms activation the tem images in fig 6a clearly shows that the raw boron exhibits crystal structure with clear lattice spacings while some impurities b2o3 occurred on the surface of the used boron fig 6b after acid treatment the impurities on the surface of boron were eliminated however the crystallinity of boron became indistinct fig 6c and the peak intensity of boron became weak in xrd spectra fig s15 this is because the acid treatment not only removed b2o3 but also corroded the crystal structure of boron additionally the performance of crystal boron was inferior to that of amorphous boron in spite of the highly crystalline structures fig s16 both the surface chemistry and intrinsic structures determined the reactivities of crystalline and amorphous boron samples in redox reactions based on the above discussions the mechanism was proposed for plasticizer degradation in the boron pms system as illustrated in fig 7 the surface of boron was gradually oxidized to b2o3 by providing electrons to pms one boron atom can provide three electrons to three pms molecules the surface boron oxide was dissolved in acidic solution and subsurface fresh boron was exposed to realize the successive activation of pms during pms activation the majority of electrons from boron tend to migrate to the oso3 part of pms ho oso3 leading to the generation of a wealth of oh to attack plasticizers a minor amount of sulfate radicals was also generated from direct electron transfer from boron to pms or inter transformation from oh 3 5 the effect of matrix to assess the applicability of the boron pms system in treatment of wastewater effluents or natural water we investigated the effects of typical inorganic anions such as cl hco3 hpo4 2 so4 2 and no3 as well as natural organic matters nom as shown in fig 8 a the removal rate of dep was gradually decreased from 95 5 to 73 8 in 60 min with increased dosage of cl from 0 to 2 0 mm cl can react with pms to generate oxidative hocl eq 18 e0 1 49 v vs nhe and cl2 eq 19 e0 1 36 v vs nhe anipsitakis et al 2006 lei et al 2016 while these free available chlorine species cannot oxidize dep meanwhile the above two equations eqs 18 and 19 will compete with the boron pms system resulting in the decreased formation of oh and so4 furthermore cl could react with oh and so4 to form less oxidative species such as cloh eq 20 and cl eq 21 lee et al 2020 respectively hence the presence of chloride ion slightly decreased the activity of the boron pms system due to the generation of less reactive chlorine species at the expense of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals moreover as illustrated in fig 8b and 8c the inhibited oxidation by hco3 and hpo4 2 are due to the quenching effect on oh and so4 via eqs 22 25 at the dosage of anions below 1 0 mm lee et al 2020 an excessive concentration 1 0 mm of hco3 and hpo4 2 would keep the solution ph to a near neutral condition table s2 leading to the surface passivation of boron and poor degradation kinetics however the removal rate of dep was increased unexpectedly from 25 5 to 38 3 at 60 min with the excessive dosage of hpo4 2 from 1 0 to 2 0 mm fig 8c it is because phosphate anion was reported to be able to directly activate pms for organic mineralization and its activity favored the neutral ph and increased concentration of phosphate anion lou et al 2014 encouragingly as shown in fig 8d e an inappreciable effect was observed in the presence of so4 2 no3 and ha suggesting that their competitive reactions with radicals oh and so4 were negligible the boron pms system exhibits a superior resistance to the influence of organic matters which is different from conventional radical based aops chen et al 2017 lamsal et al 2011 liu et al 2016 the competitive kinetics between ha and dep were calculated in text s5 lutze et al 2015 the competitive kinetics coefficients f oh dep ha and f so 4 dep ha were 80 99 and 13 18 accordingly when the dosage of ha was 2 mg l implying that partial hydroxyl radicals and most of sulfate radicals were captured by ha moreover the observed experimental data nearly fell in the simulated curve calculated by the kinetic constant k cal dep ha of 7 02 10 4 s 1 fig s18 suggesting that the consumed radicals by ha had little contribution to dep degradation this is because the dep degradation mainly relied on the amount of hydroxyl radicals rather than sulfate radicals in the boron pms system resulting in an inconspicuous inhibitive effect of ha 18 hso 5 c l hocl so 4 2 19 hso 5 2 c l h c l 2 so 4 2 h 2 o 20 c l oh clo h k 4 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 21 c

1 2 10 6 m 1 s 1 the performances of boron pms system for dep decomposition in tap water sea water and river water were carried out as shown in fig s17 the removal efficiencies of dep reached 95 0 67 4 18 3 and 0 6 in ultrapure tap sea and river waters respectively due to the different characteristics of these real water matrixes specifically the ph of tap water was 9 04 table s2 and the tap water had a limited buffer capacity as a result the initial solution ph of tap water immediately dropped to 3 62 greater than 3 0 after the addition of 2 0 mm pms meanwhile the co existed chloride might quench the radical or directly react with oxidant pms to result in less reactive species leading to a poor oxidation efficiency of plasticizer moreover sea and river waters are more complicated compared with tap water due to their high alkalinity and rich background anions e g cl hco3 and hpo4 2 the initial reaction ph was higher than 4 5 after the addition of pms into the sea and river waters resulting in the passivation of boron surface with mediocre dep removal rates therefore the treatment efficiency of dep in actual water was highly dependent on the initial ph buffer capacity and the background matters i e the lower reaction solution ph the higher removal rate of plasticizers however operating costs are still one of the most key factors in real water treatment the acidic solutions are conductive to plasticizer removal in the boron pms system but it requires a high chemical consumption because the ph values of effluents need be adjusted to neutral before discharge in addition the mineralization rates of plasticizers e g dep and bpa reached 50 in 120 min fig s19 other plasticizers e g dmp and dbp could also be rapidly degraded within 60 min in the boron pms system fig s20 the results suggest that the promising technology is highly efficient to eliminate the plasticizers in water especially for phthalic esters and phenolic compounds 4 conclusions in summary we applied a metal free boron based ps aops system for the degradation of bisphenols and phthalates plasticizers the epr and chemical quenching tests as well as kinetic calculations uncovered that hydroxyl and sulfate radicals were generated in the ratio of 5 2 in the boron pms system compared with nonradical and selective n cnt pms system the radical based boron pms system exhibited universal and superior efficiencies for the degradation of bisphenols and phthalates plasticizers the characterization techniques unveil that the surface of amorphous boron was oxidized into b2o3 during the activation of pms which was subsequently dissolved in acidic solution to expose fresh boron and recover the reductive activity this study provides new insights into boron redox chemistry in advanced oxidation technology more importantly the metal free aops system provides a promising technique for the control and rapid purification of bisphenols and phthalates plasticizers in the real wastewater

17563,plasticizer pollution in drinking water and aquatic systems has raised global concerns due to the lasting and chronic hazards to marine life and public health metal free materials are promising as green catalysts for wastewater purification in this study amorphous boron was applied as a metal free activator to decompose peroxymonosulfate pms for the degradation of plasticizers in water integrating radical trapping and selectively quenching tests with kinetic evaluation and electrochemical analysis hydroxyl radical was found to be the dominating reactive oxygen species ros with a strong oxidative capacity the boron pms system can effectively degrade both bisphenols and phthalates plasticizers in contrast a carbon nanotube catalyzed pms system mediated a nonradical pathway to oxidize the electron rich plasticizer bisphenol a but ineffectively to decompose the highly recalcitrant phthalates plasticizers diethyl phthalate moreover we unveiled that the boron surface was oxidized to boron oxide during the redox reaction and the oxide would be self cleaned in the acidic solution to regenerate fresh boron and restore the activity during the cyclic operations therefore this work not only gains new insights into the radical and nonradical oxidations by metal free catalysis but also provides feasible technologies for plasticizer purification in water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords plasticizer peroxymonosulfate boron metal free catalysis hydroxyl radicals 1 introduction the plastic industry has been booming in recent decades and the global annual production of plastics has already increased to 360 million tons in 2018 rapp et al 2020 plasticizers are indispensable chemical additives and their composition may overpass 85 in some plastic products bui et al 2016 however improper uses of plastic products may lead to the release of plasticizers into the aquatic surroundings as persistent water pollutants the frequent exposure to plasticizers has potential harmful effects on the endocrine systems of aquatic lives and human beings including developmental retardation immunologic derangement neurodevelopmental problems reproductive hormone abnormalities and cancers luo et al 2018 sheikh et al 2016 in order to control the plastic pollution some regulations on the production and use of plasticizers especially for phthalates paes and bisphenols bps have come into force in many countries larsson et al 2017 luo et al 2018 unfortunately paes and bps are still frequently detected in drinking water due to their chemical durability and biological recalcitrance ding et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 persulfate based advanced oxidation processes ps aops are effective technologies by producing a series of reactive

methods metal free ps aops have been intensively investigated due to elemental abundance high efficiency and environmental friendliness chen et al 2018 duan et al 2018c qi et al 2020 yu et al 2020 zhao et al 2017 boron and carbon have been reported as effective metal free catalysts for pms activation but the ros and reaction pathways in the two systems are discrepant due to the distinct ground state electronic configuration of boron 1s2 2s2 2p1 and carbon 1s2 2s2 2p2 specifically the o o bond of pms was cleaved by sp3 hybridized nanodiamond to generate free radicals whereas the graphitized nanodiamond sp2 sp3 activated pms to produce surface reactive complexes duan et al 2018a similarly graphitic carbon nanotube cnt effectively activated pms to form nonradical complexes which directly attacked the electron rich pollutants via electron transfer ren et al 2020a although boron and carbon are neighboring nonmetals in the periodic table boron with one single electron in the 2p orbital endows it metallic properties to coordinate a radical process during the interaction with pms shao et al 2017 moreover density functional theory dft illustrated that the oso3 part of pms ho oso3 was more likely to accept an electron from boron to generate oh and so4 2 duan et al 2019 however due to the limited research on boron chemistry the underlining mechanism is unclear and the poor stability of boron needs to be addressed in practical applications in the recent studies on ps aops the emerging nonradical oxidation pathways such as singlet oxygenation and electron transfer process exhibit high selectivity toward electron rich pollutants and bacteria in water purification duan et al 2018b guan et al 2017 ho et al 2019 hu et al 2017 su et al 2020 nitrogen doped cnt n cnt would react with pms to form n cnt pms complexes which attacked phenols via an electron transfer pathway duan et al 2015 ren et al 2020a however the oxidation potential of the system was mild and the electron migration regime was ineffective for the removal of electron deficient contaminants in contrast oh would non selectively react with most organics at high rate constants 106 to 1010 m 1s 1 lee et al 2020 amorphous boron is a metal free catalyst to evolve free radicals in ps aops systems for the degradation of various organics duan et al 2019 electron rich bisphenols plasticizers such as bisphenol a bpa and bisphenol s bps could be oxidized via either radical or nonradical pathway su et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 however the highly recalcitrant phthalates plasticizers including dimethyl phthalate dmp diethyl phthalate dep and dibutyl phthalate dbp could only be degraded by radical ros an et al 2014 ren et al 2016 the removal efficiency of plasticizers not only relies on the species and quantity of ros but also on the kinetics between the ros and plasticizers in this study amorphous boron was used as metal free catalysts to activate pms for the oxidation of plasticizers quenching experiment kinetics calculation electrochemical analysis electron spin resonance esr and in situ raman spectra were applied to reveal the oxidation pathways of bisphenols and phthalates plasticizers in the boron pms system as well as comparisons with the nonradical n cnt pms system more importantly the mechanism of boron based pms activation was unveiled via x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps x ray diffraction xrd raman spectra and transmission electron microscopy tem the natural background factors were also investigated for the application of the boron pms system in real water treatment 2

ultimate 3000 high performance liquid chromatograph hplc with a c 18 column the leaching concentration of boron was measured by an agilent 8900x triple quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms residual concentrations of pms were determined by the spectrophotometry approach with the co addition of potassium iodide and sodium bicarbonate liang et al 2008 hydrogen evolution was sampled in an airtight container and analyzed by a microgc 490 gas chromatograph gc 3 results and discussion 3 1 the active species of boron pms system the activity of boron was assessed for pms activation toward dep degradation as shown in fig 1 a inconspicuous removal of dep 2 0 was observed with the sole presence of boron or pms indicating that dep elimination by boron adsorption and direct oxidation by pms was insufficient however the removal efficiency of dep was dramatically increased to 95 0 once boron and pms were mixed suggesting that more effective ros were generated meanwhile the catalytic activity of the reaction system was improved gradually with the increased dosage of boron 0 0 5 g l fig s1 and pms 0 3 0 mm fig s2 the optimal initial concentrations for boron and pms were determined as 0 2 g l and 3 0 mm respectively in order to investigate the evolution and species of ros involved in the boron pms system a series of techniques such as radical trapping and visualization by esr selectively ros quenching in situ raman spectroscopy and on line open circuit potential monitoring were used to identify the radical and nonradical processes fig 1b depicts that no obvious signal was observed in the presence of boron alone while quartet characteristic peaks of dmpo oh with intensity ratios of 1 2 2 1 were captured with the addition of pms alone however the signals of pms alone were weak suggesting that pms itself without activation could not generate large numbers of ros for dep oxidation fig 1a much stronger signals of dmpo oh were observed in the presence of boron and pms indicating that a myriad of hydroxyl radicals were generated in the pms boron system which contributed to the rapid degradation of dep to quantitatively determine the formation of hydroxyl radicals in the boron pms and pms alone systems we adopted a fluorescence method using coumarin as a trap agent ren et al 2016 although the fluorescence intensity gradually increased with prolonged reaction time in both the systems fig s3 the accumulated fluorescence intensity of boron pms was 30 times higher than that of pms alone in 60 min fig 1c the results suggest that hydroxyl radicals were generated in both systems and the radical yield in the boron pms system was much higher than pms alone system which coincides with the results of dep degradation and epr spectra in the boron pms system since sulfate radicals are typical ros in ps aops systems radical scavenging experiments with meoh and tba were conducted to evaluate the contributions of oh and so4 as shown in fig 2 a the removal of dep was almost impeded with either meoh or tba suggesting that oh played a vital role in the degradation of dep however it does not mean that no so4 was generated in the boron pms system this is because dep oxidation depends on the quantity of radicals as well as the reaction kinetics between the radicals and dep it was reported that the second order rate constant for the reaction of dep with oh k dep oh 3 7 109 m 1s 1 is 60 times higher than that with so4 k dep so4 6 4 107 m 1s 1 wang et al 2018b hence the insignificant contribution of so4 in dep oxidation might be due to the much lower k dep so4 than k dep oh in order to verify the assumption a bisphenol plasticizer bpa was employed as another target pollutant because the second order rate constant of bpa with so4 k bpa so4 1 4 109 m 1s 1 is much higher than dep k dep so4 6 4 107 m 1s 1 sanchez polo et al 2013 and the generated alcohol radicals such as ch2oh eqs 1 and 2 and ch2 ch3 2coh eqs 3 and 4 cannot degrade phenols in the pds alcohol system zhu et al 2018a therefore the contribution of so4 would be more significant in bpa degradation in the presence of meoh or tba kong et al 2019 as shown in fig 2b the quenching effect of tba was limited and bpa removal decreased from 92 2 to 62 6 after the addition of meoh bpa removal dropped to 7 8 suggesting that both oh and so4 were produced in the boron pms system meanwhile two benchmark radical systems of ag pds so4 eq 5 and fe2 h2o2 oh eq 6 were evaluated anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 as illustrated in fig 2c f so4 the ag pds system could effectively decompose bpa but demonstrated a poor oxidation capacity toward dep whereas oh the fe2 h2o2 system exhibited a superior activity in the degradation of both dep and bpa the discrepant oxidation results are related to their individual second order rate constants k bpa so4 k dep so4 k bpa oh and k dep oh of the radicals so4 and oh with plasticizers bpa and dep k bpa so4 1 4 109 m 1s 1 is about two orders of magnitude higher than k dep so4 6 4 107 m 1s 1 whereas both k bpa oh 1 7 1010 m 1s 1 and k dep oh 3 7 109 m 1s 1 overpass 109 m 1s 1 which are greater than most of reaction rate constants between ros and organics lee et al 2020 sanchez polo et al 2013 wang et al 2018b 1 so 4 c h 3 oh c h 2 oh so 4 2 h 2 oh c h 3 oh c h 2 oh h 2 o 3 so 4 c h 3 3 coh c h 2 c h 3 2 oh so 4

established nonradical oxidation system via an electron transfer regime duan et al 2018c ren et al 2020a as shown in fig 2g the removal rate of dep with n cnt alone was similar to the rate with the co addition of n cnt and pms suggesting that most of dep was removed by adsorption dep could not be degraded by the nonradical pathway due to the relatively low redox potential and specific selectivity to electron rich substrates in contrast the n cnt pms system exhibited a fast removal of bpa and the addition of meoh presented unapparent inhibition fig 2h illustrating that bpa can be oxidized by the nonradical process in the n cnt pms system moreover solvent exchange experiment water to deuteroxide was applied to assess the contribution of singlet oxygen 1o2 because 1o2 possesses a much longer lifetime in deuteroxide d2o solvent than water h2o bregnhoj et al 2016 gao et al 2020 the oxidation kinetics of bpa was not enhanced in both boron pms fig 2b and n cnt pms fig 2h systems when exchanging the solvent from h2o to d2o suggesting the ineffectiveness of singlet oxygenation in the two systems to further probe the pms activation mechanism by metal free boron the open circuit potentials of the catalysts was in real time monitored during the pms activation as demonstrated in fig 3 the potential of boron climbed from 0 209 to 0 305 v reaching a new equilibrium potential with the addition of pms the addition of bpa or dep had little interference on the equilibrium potential inset fig 3 illustrating that there was no electron transfer process directly from the organics bpa and dep to boron or surface activated pms during the degradation of the organics in comparison the potential of n cnt sharply raised in the addition of pms and then the potential decreased upon the addition of bpa in contrast the addition of dep did not cause a decline in the potential the results suggest that bpa could be oxidized by carbon driven nonradical oxidation while n cnt pms was incapable of oxidizing dep which is accorded with the oxidation kinetics in fig 2g and 2h moreover in situ raman spectroscopy was applied to compare the interaction of pms with boron and n cnt fig 4 demonstrates that a new peak of activated pms pms emerged at around 835 cm 1 after the addition of cnt into pms solution while no new peak appeared for boron the results illustrate that different from n cnt pms to produce surface confined intermediates ren et al 2020a boron may directly transfer electrons to pms to release radicals into the solution for homogeneous oxidation notably boron is an insulating and reductive element which was capable of offering electrons to pms for the direct cleavage of the peroxide o o bond into radicals duan et al 2019 3 2 the effect of ph ph value is a crucial parameter in practical water treatment and the effects of initial ph ph0 on the degradations of dep and bpa were investigated in the boron pms system the removal efficiencies of dep were 95 0 51 7 24 5 and 1 2 at ph0 of 3 0 4 0 5 0 and 7 0 respectively fig 5 a similarly the removal rates of bpa fig s4 and the consumption of pms fig s5 decreased with the increased solution ph0 thus pms activation on boron was favorable at acidic conditions furthermore the leaching concentrations of boron remarkably increased from 0 17 to 0 95 mg l 1 at ph0 of 3 0 and increased from 0 15 to 0 52 mg l 1 at ph0 of 5 0 after the addition of pms respectively fig s6 however the equivalent or more boric acid 0 2 mg l 1 fig s7 had a limited contribution to the dep degradation revealing that the leaching boric ions could not decompose pms into radicals and the ph might affect the properties of the interfacial boron zeta potential was measured to investigate the electrostatic interactions between pms and boron surface the zeta potential of boron surface gradually decreased with increased ph fig s8 suggesting that the adsorption of pms onto the boron surface became more difficult while solution ph changed from acidic to neutral conditions on the other hand in situ raman was applied to monitor the evolution of surface boron chemistry at different phs as shown in fig 5b the intensity of b o bond became stronger at increased solution ph0 indicating that boron oxides were formed on boron which covered the reductive boron surface and caused the passivation during the pms activation therefore surface boron atoms would experience hydroxylation reactions in the neutral or alkaline solution the negative zeta potential of boron surface enhanced its electrostatic interactions with pms meanwhile the active sites of boron were occupied by oxygen atoms resulting in the inhibited interactions of boron and pms to generate radicals 3 3 kinetic calculation the concentrations of radicals were computed according to the kinetic calculations text s3 the degradation of dep and bpa by the boron pms system followed a pseudo first order kinetic model and their degradation processes were expressed as eq 7 the effective ros were hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical without nonradical based on the results of 3 1 part and their corresponding degradation processes were represented in a simplified kinetic model as eq 8 moreover eq 9 was then deduced by substituting eq 7 in eq 8 chen et al 2019 7 ln c c 0 k obs c t 8 d c d t k c oh o h c k c so 4 s o 4 c 9 k obs c t k c oh o h d t k c so 4 s o 4 d t where c and c 0 represent the concentrations of target pollutants at reaction and initial time respectively t represents the reaction time k obs c represents the apparent pseudo first order kinetic constant of target pollutant k c oh and k c so4 represent the second order rate constants for the reaction of target pollutants dep or bpa with hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical respectively oh and so4 represent the concentrations of hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical in the boron pms system respectively based on the kinetics assumptions text s3 the expressions of oh dt eq 10 and so 4 dt eq 11 were calculated through substituting the rate constants k obs c k c oh and k c so4 of the two target pollutants dep and bpa into eq 9 chen et al 2019 10 o h d t k o b s b p a k

concentrations of radicals oh ave and so4 ave are defined by eqs 12 and 13 12 oh ave 1 t oh dt k obs bpa k dep so 4 k obs dep k bpa so 4 k bpa oh k dep so 4 k dep oh k bpa so 4 13 so 4 ave 1 t so 4 dt k obs dep k bpa oh k obs bpa k dep oh k bpa oh k dep so 4 k dep oh k bpa so 4 the k obs dep and k obs bpa were obtained from kinetic experiments for the degradation of dep and bpa fig s9 respectively the values of oh ave and so4 ave at different phs were calculated by eqs 12 and 13 the results show that oh ave 2 34 10 13 m was about 2 5 times as high as that of so4 ave 9 29 10 14 m at ph0 3 0 reflecting that oh was more likely to be generated in the boron pms system the kinetics computations suggest that the electrons from boron were inclined to migrate to the oii so3 in pms h oi oii so3 resulting in the generation of oh and so4 2 moreover when ph0 was adjusted from 3 0 to 5 0 oh ave and so4 ave were decreased by 10 times to 2 07 10 14 m and 7 92 10 15 m respectively the result suggests that the inhibited degradation at higher ph0 was due to the inadequate concentration of radicals in the boron pms moreover the accuracy of the calculated values oh ave and so4 ave was verified by a separate test taking another plasticizer dibutyl phthalate dbp as a testing compound its rate constants k dbp oh and k dbp so 4 are 6 3 109 and 1 2 108 m 1s 1 respectively wang et al 2018a the pseudo first order kinetic model based on the calculated kinetic constant k cal dbp of 1 48 10 3 s 1 text s3 could well fit the experimental data at ph0 3 0 fig s10 confirming that the kinetics calculation was feasible in the mechanistic study on radical quenching experiments the use of inappropriate scavengers may lead to a biased verdict for example superfluous scavengers would affect the adsorption of an organic or oxidant on the catalyst to slowdown the reaction rather than selectively quench the target ros ren et al 2020b additionally some quenchers are less selective and also react with the oxidant directly cheng et al 2019 ren et al 2019 yun et al 2018 herein computation was established to examine the feasibility of scavengers in the quenching experiments according to the theoretical assumption and formula derivation text s4 the calculative equation was expressed as eq 14 14 k c q f oh c q k c oh t oh d t f so 4 c q k c so 4 t so 4 d t where k c q represents the first order rate constants of target pollutant in the presence of a quencher f oh c q and f so4 c q represent the proportions of oh and so4 reacting with the target pollutant in the presence of the quenching agent respectively matzek et al 2018 taking bpa degradation for an example the calculative equations of kinetics for quenching reactions by tba and meoh were obtained as eqs 15 and 16 the value of k cal bpa tba was calculated to be 5 58 10 4 s 1 which was close to the observed value of k obs bpa tba 3 88 10 4 s 1 fig s11 in the quenching experiment of tba moreover the relative deviation between the calculated value of k cal bpa meoh 6 16 10 5 s 1 and the observed value of k obs bpa meoh 7 14 10 5 s 1 fig s11 was 13 7 in the presence of meoh suggesting that tba and meoh were the suitable scavengers to selectively screen oh and so4 accordingly during bpa degradation by the boron pms system therefore the calculated rate constants are conducive to judge the targeted or untargeted roles of scavengers in the radical quenching experiment the results of relative deviation between the calculated and observed values will provide a valid way to screen the optimal quenchers in an unknow system which can further improve the accuracy of the proposed mechanism 15 k cal bpa tba f oh bpa tba k bpa oh t oh d t f so 4 bpa tba k bpa so 4 t so 4 d t 16 k cal bpa meoh f oh bpa meoh k bpa oh t oh d t f so 4 bpa meoh k bpa so 4 t so 4 d t where k cal bpa tba and k cal bpa meoh represent the calculated first order rate constants of bpa in the presences of tba and meoh in the boron pms system in addition hydrogen evolution via the hydrolysis of metalloid boron eq 17 at high temperature is an efficient and promising energy technology compared to zero valent metals such as aluminum magnesium iron and zinc wahbeh et al 2012 in this work hydrogen evolution was measured to estimate the surface activity of boron at different phs as demonstrated in fig 5c the yields of hydrogen at ph0 of 3 0 and 5 0 were 14 4 and 5 9 μmol h 1g 1 accordingly in the pms boron system however no hydrogen was observed with the addition of boron alone ph0 of 3 0 pms alone ph0 of 3 0 or the co presence of boron and pms ph0 of 7 0 the results suggest that the acidic environment and the co existence of pms are the prerequisites for hydrogen evolution over amorphous boron the process of hydrogen evolution could be relevant to the generation of so4 and oh because the oi h part of pms h oi oii so3 was more likely to bond with h to produce oi h h through hydrogen bond meanwhile the catalyst would further provide electrons to oi h h via the breakup of oi h and reduction of h for hydrogen evolution zhang et al 2020 the gap between the yield of h2 0 17 μm and the total consumption of pms 9 60 μm fig s5 was about 56 times in difference suggesting that most of pms were decomposed to generate oh but only a small portion of pms was consumed for the production of so4 or hydrogen evolution 17 2 b 3 h 2 o 3 h 2 b 2 o 3 3 4 reaction mechanism of the boron pms system the cyclic performances of boron were evaluated the removal rate of dep gradually declined from 95 0 to 70 7 after the fourth use fig 5d and the leaching concentrations of boron were correspondingly decreased from 0 95 to 0 52 mg l 1 fig s12 implying that the slight surface passivation of boron in the multiple uses however the catalytic activity of the deactivated boron was recovered after acid washing and the leaching concentration raised to 1 22 mg l 1 suggesting that the acid treatment cleaned the inactive boron oxide to expose more fresh boron on the surface for pms activation since addition of pms typically would induce a decline of solution ph to around 3 0 table s2 the good stability of boron in the four cycles may be attributed to the partial self cleaning during the reaction with pms to investigate the evolution of surface boron during the pms activation we analyzed the surface chemical species and contents of boron by xps as shown in fig 6 a c the b1s peak can be fitted into three components at the binding energies of 187 72 188 52 and 191 98 ev attributed to b b boron suboxide and b2o3 respectively moddeman et al 1989 ongi et al 2004 a new peak of b2o3 was observed on the surface of used boron and it vanished after acid washing suggesting that b2o3 was the oxidative product of boron during pms activation and an acid treatment was conductive to the removal of inactive b2o3 on the surface of boron in addition this phenomenon was also confirmed by raman analysis and tem imaging a distinct new peak emerged at around 920 cm 1 on the used boron fig s13 which was ascribed to the bending vibrations of b o bond of b2o3 li et al 1995 moreover the peak intensity of b o bond was weaker after acid treatment for the used boron hydroxylated surface boron was the active site for ferric reduction and thus tetrahydroxydiboron thdb was used as a model molecule to simulate the reactivity of boron intermediate zhou et al 2020 unfortunately dep could not be removed by thdb pms figure s14 suggesting that surface hydroxylation of boron inhibited pms activation the tem images in fig 6a clearly shows that the raw boron exhibits crystal structure with clear lattice spacings while some impurities b2o3 occurred on the surface of the used boron fig 6b after acid treatment the impurities on the surface of boron were eliminated however the crystallinity of boron became indistinct fig 6c and the peak intensity of boron became weak in xrd spectra fig s15 this is because the acid treatment not only removed b2o3 but also corroded the crystal structure of boron additionally the performance of crystal boron was inferior to that of amorphous boron in spite of the highly crystalline structures fig s16 both the surface chemistry and intrinsic structures determined the reactivities of crystalline and amorphous boron samples in redox reactions based on the above discussions the mechanism was proposed for plasticizer degradation in the boron pms system as illustrated in fig 7 the surface of boron was gradually oxidized to b2o3 by providing electrons to pms one boron atom can provide three electrons to three pms molecules the surface boron oxide was dissolved in acidic solution and subsurface fresh boron was exposed to realize the successive activation of pms during pms activation the majority of electrons from boron tend to migrate to the oso3 part of pms ho oso3 leading to the generation of a wealth of oh to attack plasticizers a minor amount of sulfate radicals was also generated from direct electron transfer from boron to pms or inter transformation from oh 3 5 the effect of matrix to assess the applicability of the boron pms system in treatment of wastewater effluents or natural water we investigated the effects of typical inorganic anions such as cl hco3 hpo4 2 so4 2 and no3 as well as natural organic matters nom as shown in fig 8 a the removal rate of dep was gradually decreased from 95 5 to 73 8 in 60 min with increased dosage of cl from 0 to 2 0 mm cl can react with pms to generate oxidative hocl eq 18 e0 1 49 v vs nhe and cl2 eq 19 e0 1 36 v vs nhe anipsitakis et al 2006 lei et al 2016 while these free available chlorine species cannot oxidize dep meanwhile the above two equations eqs 18 and 19 will compete with the boron pms system resulting in the decreased formation of oh and so4 furthermore cl could react with oh and so4 to form less oxidative species such as cloh eq 20 and cl eq 21 lee et al 2020 respectively hence the presence of chloride ion slightly decreased the activity of the boron pms system due to the generation of less reactive chlorine species at the expense of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals moreover as illustrated in fig 8b and 8c the inhibited oxidation by hco3 and hpo4 2 are due to the quenching effect on oh and so4 via eqs 22 25 at the dosage of anions below 1 0 mm lee et al 2020 an excessive concentration 1 0 mm of hco3 and hpo4 2 would keep the solution ph to a near neutral condition table s2 leading to the surface passivation of boron and poor degradation kinetics however the removal rate of dep was increased unexpectedly from 25 5 to 38 3 at 60 min with the excessive dosage of hpo4 2 from 1 0 to 2 0 mm fig 8c it is because phosphate anion was reported to be able to directly activate pms for organic mineralization and its activity favored the neutral ph and increased concentration of phosphate anion lou et al 2014 encouragingly as shown in fig 8d e an inappreciable effect was observed in the presence of so4 2 no3 and ha suggesting that their competitive reactions with radicals oh and so4 were negligible the boron pms system exhibits a superior resistance to the influence of organic matters which is different from conventional radical based aops chen et al 2017 lamsal et al 2011 liu et al 2016 the competitive kinetics between ha and dep were calculated in text s5 lutze et al 2015 the competitive kinetics coefficients f oh dep ha and f so 4 dep ha were 80 99 and 13 18 accordingly when the dosage of ha was 2 mg l implying that partial hydroxyl radicals and most of sulfate radicals were captured by ha moreover the observed experimental data nearly fell in the simulated curve calculated by the kinetic constant k cal dep ha of 7 02 10 4 s 1 fig s18 suggesting that the consumed radicals by ha had little contribution to dep degradation this is because the dep degradation mainly relied on the amount of hydroxyl radicals rather than sulfate radicals in the boron pms system resulting in an inconspicuous inhibitive effect of ha 18 hso 5 c l hocl so 4 2 19 hso 5 2 c l h c l 2 so 4 2 h 2 o 20 c l oh clo h k 4 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 21 c

1 2 10 6 m 1 s 1 the performances of boron pms system for dep decomposition in tap water sea water and river water were carried out as shown in fig s17 the removal efficiencies of dep reached 95 0 67 4 18 3 and 0 6 in ultrapure tap sea and river waters respectively due to the different characteristics of these real water matrixes specifically the ph of tap water was 9 04 table s2 and the tap water had a limited buffer capacity as a result the initial solution ph of tap water immediately dropped to 3 62 greater than 3 0 after the addition of 2 0 mm pms meanwhile the co existed chloride might quench the radical or directly react with oxidant pms to result in less reactive species leading to a poor oxidation efficiency of plasticizer moreover sea and river waters are more complicated compared with tap water due to their high alkalinity and rich background anions e g cl hco3 and hpo4 2 the initial reaction ph was higher than 4 5 after the addition of pms into the sea and river waters resulting in the passivation of boron surface with mediocre dep removal rates therefore the treatment efficiency of dep in actual water was highly dependent on the initial ph buffer capacity and the background matters i e the lower reaction solution ph the higher removal rate of plasticizers however operating costs are still one of the most key factors in real water treatment the acidic solutions are conductive to plasticizer removal in the boron pms system but it requires a high chemical consumption because the ph values of effluents need be adjusted to neutral before discharge in addition the mineralization rates of plasticizers e g dep and bpa reached 50 in 120 min fig s19 other plasticizers e g dmp and dbp could also be rapidly degraded within 60 min in the boron pms system fig s20 the results suggest that the promising technology is highly efficient to eliminate the plasticizers in water especially for phthalic esters and phenolic compounds 4 conclusions in summary we applied a metal free boron based ps aops system for the degradation of bisphenols and phthalates plasticizers the epr and chemical quenching tests as well as kinetic calculations uncovered that hydroxyl and sulfate radicals were generated in the ratio of 5 2 in the boron pms system compared with nonradical and selective n cnt pms system the radical based boron pms system exhibited universal and superior efficiencies for the degradation of bisphenols and phthalates plasticizers the characterization techniques unveil that the surface of amorphous boron was oxidized into b2o3 during the activation of pms which was subsequently dissolved in acidic solution to expose fresh boron and recover the reductive activity this study provides new insights into boron redox chemistry in advanced oxidation technology more importantly the metal free aops system provides a promising technique for the control and rapid purification of bisphenols and phthalates plasticizers in the real wastewater

17564,this study evaluated the potential of a microplasma uv lamp as an alternative uv source to the current mercury based hg based uv lamp for water disinfection we developed a set of pcr based molecular assays long range qpcr dnase and binding assay to quantify the adenovirus genome capsid and fiber damage with a wide detection range 100 5 106 5 pfu ml we used these molecular assays to characterize adenovirus adv inactivation kinetics by microplasma uv that produced monochromatic uv at 222 nm we found that the inactivation rate constant 0 142 cm2 mj due to microplasma uv was 4 4 times higher than that of low pressure hg uv 0 032 cm2 mj this high efficacy was attributed to monochromatic uv wavelength at 222 nm damaging the adv capsid protein the results of these molecular assays also proved that microplasma uv and medium pressure hg uv with a bandpass filter at 223 nm mpuv223nm have a similar influence on adv p 0 05 we then estimated the relative energy efficiency of mpuv and microplasma uv to lpuv for 4 log reduction of the viruses we found that the microplasma uv resulted in higher inactivation rate constants for viruses than the current hg based uv consequently microplasma uv could be more energy efficient than low pressure hg uv for water disinfection if the wall plug efficiency of the microplasma uv lamp improved to 8 4 currently 1 5 therefore the microplasma uv lamp is a promising option for water disinfection graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplasma uv lamp monochromatic uv irradiation at 222 nm adenovirus water disinfection molecular mechanisms 1 introduction ultraviolet uv irradiation has been used increasingly for the disinfection of drinking water and wastewater treatment systems linden et al 2019 because of its advantages over chemical disinfectants in comparison to chlorination uv irradiation does not produce harmful disinfection byproducts dbps mitch et al 2003 while it shows much higher disinfection efficiency to protozoa such as cryptosporidium and giardia hijnen et al 2006 the compact size and wide spectrum of applicability of uv irradiation also allow it to be applied as a stand alone disinfectant in small non community systems where a residual disinfectant is not necessary dotson et al 2012 linden et al 2019 schalk et al 2006 the majority of public water treatment facilities 97 in the united states are classified as small systems usepa 2016 and uv irradiation has been considered for microbial disinfection in these systems linden et al 2019 uv irradiation has also been applied to a portable water purifier brownell et al 2008 therefore the global market for uv disinfection equipment is expected to expand by 2 8 billion by 2020 song et al 2016 low pressure uv lpuv lamps widely used for uv disinfection in water treatment plants are filled with mercury hg gas about 10 5 bar and use 40 500 w to generate monochromatic wavelength with a peak at 254 nm schalk et al 2006 lpuvs are very effective for inactivating cryptosporidium giardia and pathogenic bacteria while viruses are known to be less susceptible to this monochromatic wavelength chevrefils et al 2006 hijnen et al 2006 adenovirus adv is particularly resistant to lpuv irradiation and requires high energy consumption for sufficient disinfection yates et al 2006 the resistance of adv to the lpuv irradiation can also increase the possibility of selective survival potentially allowing the survival of viral species that are more resistant to uv irradiation at 254 nm rachmadi et al 2018 hg the filling material for the lpuv lamp is a hazardous chemical that may cause secondary contamination hou et al 2012 in addition the hg based uv lamps require about 30 minutes to warm up and stabilize the uv radiation this time requirement is regarded as an operational disadvantage song et al 2016 a medium pressure uv mpuv lamp has been proposed as a substitute for an lpuv lamp this lamp is also filled with a higher pressure of hg gas 1 6 bar and uses 0 4 60 kw to generate polychromatic wavelengths ranging from 200 to 800 nm schalk et al 2006 the polychromatic irradiation has a higher virus inactivation efficacy than the monochromatic irradiation at 254 nm chevrefils et al 2006 however a large portion of the input energy is used for generating irradiation outside the germicidal wavelength causing high temperature up to 950 c and low energy efficiency schalk et al 2006 a uv light emitting diode led lamp was also recently discovered as a new uv source the uv led lamp has various advantages of diversity in wavelength high energy efficiency short warm up time hg free materials and durability song et al 2016 however uv led has low emission power and narrow wavelength in germicidal uvc 260 285 nm würtele et al 2011 because of the different innate characteristics of uv lamps a synergistic effect with the available uv lamps were studied hull and linden 2018 beck et al 2017 from this perspective we first need to characterize emerging uv lamps with different uv wavelengths for their inactivation efficacies this information is required to assess the potential application of these lamps for the disinfection of water and wastewater treatment for example oguma et al 2016 reported that the inactivation rate constant of monochromatic uv at 285 nm by uv led for adenovirus type 5 was 15 higher than that by lpuv microplasma uv irradiation is an emerging technology with several advantages over hg filled uv technology the microplasma lamps have microcavities a few millimeters filled with krcl electrodes deliver time varying voltages which interact with the gas to irradiate monochromatic uv with a peak at 222 nm park et al 2019 different wavelengths can also be produced depending on the filling gases e g xe2 for 172 nm xecl for 308 nm these microplasma uv lamps do not contain toxic substances such as hg microplasma uv lamps can generate high power 115 mw with small 25 cm2 and thin 6 mm lamp designs for different configurations of disinfection herring and park 2019 the short stabilization time 15 s of the microplasma uv lamp allows intermittent disinfection a higher energy efficiency and a longer lifespan of the lamp raeiszadeh and taghipour 2019 these advantages of microplasma uv technology have the potential to overcome some shortcomings of the hg based uv lamps therefore the microplasma uv lamp has been adopted in the medical field in the semiconductor industry and for air purification herring and park 2019 welch et al 2018 however microplasma uv lamps have not been widely applied to inactivate viral pathogens for water and wastewater disinfection this is probably because the unique geometry and spectral irradiance of the microplasma uv lamp have not been tested with viral pathogens a study on the impact of the microplasma uv lamp on viral pathogens and comparison with commercially available uv lamps is needed the objective of this study was to characterize microplasma uv lamps as an alternative uv source for drinking water and wastewater disinfection we conducted two analyses first we developed a set of molecular assays to quantify the damage in the genome capsid protein fiber protein and infectivity of adv by microplasma uv irradiation adv was selected because it is known as one of the most resistant waterborne viruses to the current hg based uv lamps chevrefils et al 2006 hijnen et al 2006 the findings of these assays allowed us to understand why a microplasma uv lamp provided more efficient inactivation than the current hg based uv lamps second we compared the energy efficiencies of different uv lamps the higher rate constant for virus inactivation compared to the hg based uv lamps proposes the microplasma uv lamp as another viable option in designing a uv irradiation system therefore the study findings will contribute to the potential application of microplasma uv lamps in water and wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 adv inactivation experiments by uv irradiation 2 1 1 uv irradiation by a microplasma uv lamp a microplasma uv lamp eden park illumination usa had a 16 cm2 effective illuminating area in a 5 08 5 08 cm 2 2 in rectangular surface the lamp was connected to an electric circuit which was further connected to a wall plug to ensure the stability of the power source we used a special power supply designed by eden park illumination this power supply is capable of modulating input frequency voltage and current a power meter was connected between the adaptor and wall plug to monitor the consumed total power and a ensure well controlled power supply fig 1 the spectral irradiance of the microplasma uv showed a monochromatic uv peak at 222 nm with a full width at half maximum of 3 nm fig 1 the fluence applied to the adv solution by microplasma uv was calculated by the following equations suggested by raeiszadeh and taghipour 2019 1 f 200 300 e p f d f r f λ w f λ c f t d λ 2 d f 1 l d d 1 e x d x e d 3 r f λ 1 n 1 λ n 2 λ n 1 λ n 2 λ 2 4 w f λ 1 10 α λ l α λ l l n 10 in these equations f is the average fluence inside the adv solution mj cm2 e is the incident irradiance at the center of the solution surface mw cm2 pf was a petri factor which was the ratio of the incident irradiance at the center to the average incident over the solution surface the incident irradiance was measured by a uv power meter c9536 hamamatsu photonics with a uv power meter head h9535 hamamatsu photonics and pf was 0 906 0 951 and 0 968 for 4 5 5 and 7 cm distance between the lamp and the solution respectively df was a divergence factor which was defined as the ratio of irradiance inside the empty volume to be filled with adv solution during the experiment to the average irradiance at the solution surface df was calculated by eq 2 where d is the distance between the lamp and the solution surface l is the solution depth and e x is the uv irradiance at a certain distance dfs 0 5 cm water depth were 0 918 0 929 and 0 939 for 4 5 5 and 7 cm distance respectively rf was a reflection factor at which the uv reflection at the interface of two media with different reflective indices n 1 λ and n 2 λ was considered and it is calculated using the fresnel equation eq 3 cf was a collimation factor that was defined as the delivered irradiance to the fluence rate at the solution surface the delivered irradiance can be calculated by a radiometry measurement while the fluence rate at the solution surface can be determined by an actinometry experiment the cf values were adopted from raeiszadeh and taghipour 2019 which measured it under the same experimental setup i e microplasma uv lamp petri dish size and distance from the lamp by the actinometry assay the cf value for a 5 5 cm diameter dish with 4 5 5 and 7 cm distance were 0 926 0 972 and 0 996 wf was a water factor that addressed light attenuation in the solution wf was defined as the ratio of average fluence inside the adv solution to that at the solution surface eq 4 here αλ cm 1 was the absorption coefficient of the solution at each wavelength which was measured using a spectrophotometer uv 2450 shimadzu japan finally t was the exposure time s we conducted three virus inactivation experiments where the distance between the lamp and the solutions was 4 5 5 and 7 cm we found insignificant differences in the inactivation rate constants obtained with these three distances p 0 05 by mann whitney test fig s1 the four centimeter distance was selected for the inactivation experiments using the microplasma uv lamp so that the viral solutions could be exposed to similar irradiance as that of the mpuv223nm experiment the uv irradiance was about 0 05 mw cm2 at the center of the petri dish with a 4 cm distance from the lamp fig 1 the inactivation experiments were started with the preparation of 10 5 ml of the adv solution in the quartz dish followed by taking the first sample 0 5 ml before the lamp was turned on i e fluence was 0 mj cm2 once the quartz dish with adv solution 104 5 pfu ml was exposed to uv irradiation 0 5 ml of each sample was taken at certain time intervals for further analysis including long range qpcr dnase binding and plaque assay the changes in solution height were reflected in calculating the fluence by correcting wf and df every sampling time table s1 s2 and s3 the uv irradiation experiment was replicated at least three times independently 2 1 2 uv irradiation by an mpuv lamp with a bandpass filter the mpuv lamp calgon carbon co pittsburgh pa was installed in a 1 kw rayox collimated uv system for the uv irradiation experiments although the mpuv irradiated polychromatic uv wavelength ranged from 200 to 800 nm the monochromatic uv wavelength was produced by a bandpass filter andover corporation salem nh installed at the end of the collimator isolating wavelength of interest from the polychromatic wavelength the monochromatic wavelength from the mpuv with the bandpass filter produced spectral irradiance with a peak wavelength at 223 nm and a full width at half maximum of 4 nm fig 1 the mpuv with the bandpass filter will henceforth be referred to as the mpuv223nm for adv inactivation experiments the adv solution 104 5 pfu ml was put in a quartz petri dish 5 5 cm diameter and placed 50 cm away from the mpuv lamp similar to the microplasma uv experiment 0 5 ml of each sample taken at certain time intervals was subjected to long range qpcr dnase binding and plaque assays this distance provided the similar power of uv irradiance 0 05 mw cm2 which was applied to the microplasma uv experiment the fluence inside the adv solution was determined based on the previously suggested protocol bolton and linden 2003 the equation below was used to calculate the fluence this equation was also used for the microplasma uv lamp excluding cf because the collimator was assumed to ensure cf 1 i e complete collimation pf and df were 0 852 and 0 992 in this study respectively 5 f 200 300 e p f d f r f λ w f λ t d λ 2 2 molecular assays to reveal adv inactivation efficacy and mechanisms 2 2 1 virus propagation and cell culture the human lung carcinoma cell line a549 ccl 185 was obtained from american type culture collection atcc va usa the cells were cultured in 175 cm2 flasks thermo scientific nh usa until the monolayer showed 80 100 confluency using ham f 12 media with 10 fetal bovine serum fbs thermo fisher scientific ma usa and 1x antibiotic antimycotic thermo fisher scientific ma usa these cells were either cultured for the new passage or used for further experiments including virus propagation binding assay and plaque assay human adenovirus type 2 vr 846 was also obtained from atcc the advs were propagated and purified for the inactivation experiment as follows first a549 cells with 80 100 confluency were prepared in a 175 cm2 flask after removing the media 2 ml of adv solution was added to the flask and incubated at 37 c with 5 co2 for 90 min to facilitate virus particle attachment to the host cells after providing 20 ml of ham f 12 media with 2 fbs and 1x antibiotic antimycotic the flask was incubated for 5 days for the viruses to make progenies the viruses were separated from the a549 cells by three cycles of freezing and thawing the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 2000 rpm 556 g for 10 min sorvall legend rt plus thermo fisher scientific ma usa followed by filtration through a 0 45 µm filter millipore sigma ma usa the viruses were further separated from impurities such as proteins and nutrients using ultracentrifuge optima xpn 90 ultracentrifuge beckman coulter ca usa a mix of 50 ml of the virus solution and 10 ml of the 40 sucrose solution thermo fisher scientific ma usa was placed in a sterilized ultracentrifuge tube the ultracentrifuge was then run at 1000 rpm 116 g at 4 c for 5 min followed by 36000 rpm 150700 g at 4 c for 3 hours the supernatant was removed and the virus pellet on the bottom of the ultracentrifuge tube was resuspended in 1x pbs thermo fisher scientific ma usa and stored in 80 c until use 2 2 2 long range qpcr assay to determine genomic damage it is widely known that uv irradiation induces non specific dna lesions errol et al 2006 so the longer amplicon size is preferred for identifying the uv induced dna damage rodríguez et al 2013 however the amplicon size that conventional qpcr can measure is less than 150 bp which is too short compared to the adv genome size about 36 kbp thus we developed a long range qpcr assay consisting of two sequential pcr steps where long range amplicons 10 kbp were synthesized in the first step and then short range amplicons 115 bp were replicated from the first pcr product and quantified by qpcr in the second step dna was extracted from adv before and after exposure to uv irradiation using qiaamp viral rna mini kit qiagen germany following the manufacturer s protocol the first pcr step for the long range amplicon synthesis was conducted with 2 µl of the extracted dna and 23 µl of pcr mixture from the longamp taq pcr kit new england biolabs ma usa the pcr cycle consisted of initial denaturation at 94 c for 30 s 15 cycles of denaturation at 94 c for 30 s annealing at 55 c for 60 s and extension at 65 c at 10 min and the final extension at 65 c for 10 min the first pcr product had mainly long range 10 kbp amplicons with a minor amount of single stranded dna and primers the synthesis of long range amplicons was confirmed by gel electrophoresis after 30 cycles of the first pcr step fig s2 in the second step qpcr was used for the quantification of long range amplicons from the first pcr product since the incomplete amplicons ssdna and the remaining primers in the first pcr product would affect the second qpcr step the impurities were removed by s1 nuclease thermo scientific nh usa and subsequent qiaquick pcr purification kit qiagen germany a mix of 5 µl of the first pcr product 0 1 µl of s1 nuclease 6 µl of 5x reaction buffer and 18 9 of µl nuclease free water was incubated at 37 c for 30 min immediately after the s1 nuclease reaction for the ssdna degradation was completed the pcr purification kit was applied to the mixture following the manufacturer s protocol to remove the primers and obtain 50 µl of the purified pcr product the long range dsdna was quantified by qpcr using a pair of primers targeting a 115 bp fragment on the 10 kbp long range dsdna a mix of 2 µl of the purified pcr product 5 0 µl of powerup sybr green master mix applied biosystems ca usa 0 3 µl of the reverse primer 0 3 µl of the forward primer and 2 4 µl of molecular biology grade water corning ny usa was prepared the qpcr step was run under the following conditions initial denaturation at 95 c for 10 min 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 15 s annealing and extension at 60 c for 1 min and temperature increase for melting curve from 65 c to 95 c an oligonucleotide 360 bp covering the qpcr amplicon 115 bp was designed idt corporation nj and the copy number was measured using a qubit fluorometer invitrogen ca usa for the absolute quantification of the pcr product every qpcr was run with 10 fold serial dilutions of the known concentration of the oligonucleotide the qpcr result was represented as an average value of at least three technical replications and pcr efficiency was higher than 85 throughout this research detailed information about the primers and amplicons are presented in table s4 2 2 3 dnase assay to determine viral capsid damage we developed a deoxyribonuclease dnase assay to check the adv capsid integrity it was assumed that dnase could not penetrate an intact viral capsid but once the capsid is damaged dnase can enter the virus and degrade its genomic dna this assay included a dnase reaction for dna degradation of capsid damaged virions and a subsequent long range qpcr for quantifying the dna degradation by dnase activity first the 50 µl virus samples were exposed to 2 µl of dnase with 10 µl of 10x dnase buffer and 38 µl of rnase free water dnase max kit qiagen germany after the mixture was incubated at 37 c for 40 min 10 µl of dnase removal resin was added to the mixture and incubated at room temperature for 10 min with regular resuspension for homogenization the mixture was centrifuged at 13300 rpm 17000 g for 1 min to separate the resin from the solution seventy microliters of dnase treated virus solution were taken and the genome integrity was quantified by the long range qpcr described in section 2 2 2 capsid damage was then determined based on the reduction in dna copy number caused by dnase activity 2 2 4 binding assay to determine viral fiber damage we conducted a binding assay that was slightly modified from vazquez bravo et al 2018 to evaluate adv fiber integrity which is an essential protein to bind to receptor proteins e g coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor on the host cell membrane for this assay a549 cells were used as host cells the a549 cell monolayers were prepared on 6 well plates usa scientific fl usa with 80 100 confluency the cells were inoculated with 200 µl of the virus solution and then incubated at room temperature for 90 min the plates were gently shaken every 15 min to facilitate the virus particle attachment then each well was washed three times with 1 ml of 1x pbs to remove unbound virions the virus particles bound to cells were dislodged using 200 µl of 0 05 trypsin edta thermo fisher scientific ma usa and the trypsin activity was quenched using 1 ml of ham s f12 k media with 10 fbs the solution was centrifuged at 13300 rpm 17000 g for 10 min the supernatant was removed and the virus particles bound to cells were resuspended in 200 µl 1x pbs finally the virus particles bound to the host cells were quantified by qpcr table s4 after dna extraction the number of housekeeping genes β actin in a549 cells was also measured by qpcr to check if the ratio of host cells to viruses in this experiment impacts the binding assay result thermal cycling conditions for the housekeeping gene quantification were the same as the adv qpcr 1 cycle of 95 c for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 1 min detailed information for primers and qpcr conditions were presented in table s5 and section 2 2 2 2 2 5 plaque assay to determine viral infectivity we developed a plaque assay to determine adv infectivity a549 cell monolayers were prepared on 6 well plates with 80 100 confluency the virus solutions to be assayed were serially diluted with ham s f12 k media without fbs the media in each well was aspirated and 400 µl of each adv dilution was inoculated into the cells the plates containing the cells and viruses were incubated at 37 c and 5 co2 for 90 min the plates were gently shaken every 15 min to facilitate the virus particle attachment the solution in each well was aspirated again and the cells with viruses were covered by 2 ml overlay solution which was prepared by mixing 1 31 ml of 2x minimum essential medium thermo fisher scientific ma usa 0 01 ml of 100x antibiotic antimycotic 0 05 ml of 15 mm hepes 0 03 ml of 7 5 sodium bicarbonate 0 5 ml of 1 agarose solution and 0 1 ml of fbs after solidifying the overlay solution at 4 c for about 20 min the plates were incubated at 37 c with 5 co2 for 5 days two milliliters of the 10 formaldehyde solution in pbs was put into each well and left at room temperature for two hours to fix the cells on the plate surface after removing the overlay the plaques were stained with 0 05 crystal violet in 10 ethanol for visualization fig s3 2 2 6 reliability confirmation for the molecular assays we confirmed the reliability of the three molecular assays long range qpcr dnase and binding and plaque assay by conducting calibration curves to show the relationship between virus titer and the outcome from each assay for calibration curves 10 fold serial dilutions of adv 100 5 106 5 pfu ml were prepared from the concentrated and purified intact adv these serially diluted solutions were then subjected to long range qpcr binding assay and plaque assay it was assumed here that the levels of the intact genome fiber and infectivity were also divided by 10 fold in the serial dilutions on the other hand the dnase assay was designed to quantify the capsid damaged adv not the intact capsid still the serial dilutions of intact adv cannot provide the concentration of the capsid damaged adv samples in the case of the dnase assay the enzyme activity of dna degradation depending on the shielding effect of capsid proteins was measured thus the intact virus samples before and after dna extraction were exposed to the enzyme to see the change in the dna copy number all results were obtained from the experiments with three distinct virus samples 3 biological replications followed by three separate qpcr measurements 3 technical replications 2 3 the relative energy efficiency of a uv lamp electricity consumption for uv irradiation will vary with the application sites because of the different designs of the uv reactor the electricity consumption obtained from laboratory experiments cannot directly be used to represent the energy consumption for field applications a uv reactor for a laboratory experiment is designed to provide uniform uv irradiation so that the reliable values of fluence can be calculated e g collimated beam apparatus in contrast a uv reactor for field application is designed to efficiently deliver the generated uv photons to the target molecules in water e g cylinder shape although enough information for the lpuv has been accumulated from the field application to estimate the electricity consumption the information on mpuv and microplasma uv lamp is limited because they have not been widely used in the field sharpless and linden 2005 suggested a relative energy efficiency by applying the results from a laboratory experiment with a collimated beam apparatus to estimate the electricity consumption of a uv reactor in the field the relative energy efficiency of mpuv and microplasma uv lamps to lpuv lamps in the field scale can be estimated from the inactivation rate constant the wall plug efficiency and the water factor wf assuming that the uv reactor designs are the same eq 6 6 e m i c r o p l a s m a e l p k l p k m i c r o p l a s m a c l p c m i c r o p l a s m a w f l p w f m i c r o p l a s m a the inactivation rate constants cm2 mj were determined from the experiment for inactivation kinetics and calculated using eqs 7 9 for example k was used for an inactivation rate constant which was a slope of the inactivation kinetics with log n0 n as the y axis 7 d n d t k i n 8 l n n n 0 k i t 9 l o g 10 n 0 n k f n refers to viral infectivity and the subscript indicates exposure time i indicated the uv incidence mw cm2 t was exposure time and f was a fluence mj cm2 the wall plug efficiencies for low and medium pressure uv were obtained from previous work sharpless and linden 2005 and the one for microplasma uv was provided by the manufacturer wf was the water factor weighed by photon energy over the germicidal wavelength 200 300 nm according to eqs 10 11 wf is determined by a reactor design penetration depth l water quality uv absorbance aλ lamp properties spectral irradiance ρλ we measured the spectral irradiance for the three lamps the penetration depth was assumed to be 5 cm for the three uv lamps based on the typical reactor design for drinking water and wastewater disinfection sozzi and taghipour 2006 also the uv absorbance of surface water thomas et al 1996 fig s4 was assumed for the wf calculation the relative energy efficiency with the inactivation rate constant wall plug efficiency and wf is explained further in section 3 4 10 w f λ ρ λ u λ w f λ λ ρ λ u λ 11 w f λ 1 10 a λ l l n 10 a λ l 2 4 statistical analysis all statistical analysis was performed in rstudio with the data above the detection limits analysis of covariance ancova was applied to compare the impact of uv irradiation to the genome capsid protein fiber protein and infectivity over fluence and the impact of microplasma uv and mpuv223nm over fluence analysis of variance anova was conducted to compare two groups of means the significance level was assumed to be α 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 reliability of molecular assays the long range qpcr assay was designed to determine adv genome integrity the copy number from the long range qpcr was presented with the infectivity of the initial virus solution fig 2 the calibration curve showed a strong linear correlation between the initial viral infectivity and the outcome from long range qpcr r2 0 97 the slope of this correlation was 1 00 in the range from 100 5 to 106 5 pfu ml suggesting the long range qpcr has properly quantified the intact genome thus the long range qpcr was reliable in the range from about 100 5 to 106 5 pfu ml and all subsequent experiments were conducted within this range the dnase assay was developed to determine the viral capsid integrity the mean diameter of dnase was estimated to be 4 2 nm erickson 2009 islan et al 2017 based on its shape and molecular weight chen and liao 2006 zijlstra et al 2009 we assumed that the dnase could degrade the dsdna of the adv only when the virus particles have capsid damages that are greater than 4 2 nm so that the dnase can penetrate the viral capsid and degrade the viral dna otherwise the viral capsid will protect dna from contact with dnase for verification two types of samples were prepared intact adv solution and naked dna extracted from the adv solution the only difference between the two samples was the existence of the viral capsid protecting the same dna copy number fig 3 then the two samples were exposed to either the resin alone or dnase followed by resin which was originally supposed to quench dnase activity to determine the function of dnase and resin for dna degradation in other words dnase activity was calculated by subtracting the resin effect r in fig 3 from the effect of both dnase and resin d r in fig 3 to dna degradation as a result dnase activity for dna degradation was negligible when they are protected by capsid i e adv solution in contrast the activity became significant p 0 05 when dna was exposed to dnase i e naked dna therefore dnase assay can selectively quantify the virus with the damaged capsid which allows dnase to encounter dna the reliable range of dnase was assumed to be similar to that of long range qpcr 100 5 106 5 pfu ml because the reduction in dna copy number was measured by long range qpcr assay a binding assay was applied to determine fiber integrity assuming advs with intact fibers can only bind to a549 cells and avoid being detached the copy numbers of advs bound to a549 cells were measured by qpcr and presented with initial viral infectivity fig 4 the log copy number of advs bound to the host cells linearly decreased with the initial viral concentrations from 106 5 to 102 5 pfu ml and reached a constant level when the initial viral concentrations were between 101 5 and 102 5 pfu ml fig 4a the reason for the constant virus copy number in the low concentration might be attributed to the non specific binding of advs to host cells page et al 2010 the adv copy number was also normalized to the number of a549 cells fig 4b the two graphs in fig 4 were similar to each other p 0 05 indicating that the ratio of a549 to adv did not significantly affect the binding assay results in this range of experiments these results can be explained by the similar numbers of a549 cells within each well about 105 106 these numbers of cells were enough to accommodate the virus particles less than 108 considering that one a549 cell can hold more than 104 advs wu et al 2003 3 2 adv inactivation kinetics and mechanisms by microplasma uv solutions of adv were exposed to microplasma uv irradiation and both the inactivation efficiency and mechanism were evaluated by the set of molecular assays as shown in fig 5 the experiment was repeated with a different uv irradiance 0 10 mw cm2 at the center of the solution with 4 cm distance from the lamp and the results showed no significant difference p 0 05 fig s5 this result confirmed that the microplasma uv irradiation kinetics could be normalized by the product i t referred to as fluence in this study eqs 7 9 the adv inactivation rate constant which was shown in the slope of the infectivity loss over the fluence was 0 142 cm2 mj among the three viral components the capsid damage explained the 3 log10 infectivity loss p 0 05 while genome and fiber damages were significantly different from infectivity loss p 0 05 the molecular assays indicated that microplasma uv irradiation mostly attacked the capsid proteins to inactivate adv this observation can be explained by the overlapping of the uv absorbance of capsid proteins with the microplasma uv wavelength these results agree with a previous study using a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis assay to report that the monochromatic uv damaged about 40 of the hexon and penton proteins at 220 nm of 22 7 mj cm2 beck et al 2018 genome damage increased up to about 1 log of reduction as fluence increased until about 5 mj cm2 before reaching saturation this saturation was also confirmed with the naked dna sample fig s6 this plateau was attributed to the reversibility of the lesion of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers cpds the most common lesion caused by uvc irradiation the cpds formation follows a pseudo zero order reaction in contrast the reversal reaction conforms to a first order reaction so the two reactions reach an equilibrium state at a certain concentration of cpds in the adv genome errol et al 2006 the fiber damage was not significantly different from the negative control p 0 05 at fluences of less than 21 2 mj cm2 this observation meant monochromatic uv at 222 nm is not effective to degrade the viral fiber proteins a similar trend was also confirmed by beck et al 2018 showing fiber damage was negligible at fluences less than 22 7 mj cm2 of monochromatic uv irradiation at 220 nm generated by a deuterium uv lamp with a bandpass filter the results of the molecular assays also provided knowledge on the damage patterns on adv these damage patterns were a unique consequence of the uv irradiation because each assay directly measured the damage on the virus particles therefore the damage patterns on advs can play a role as a fingerprint for certain disinfectants we confirmed that the infectivity loss by mpuv223nm was not significantly different p 0 05 from that by microplasma uv and the primary damage occurred to the capsid fig s7 thus the inactivation efficacies and mechanisms by microplasma uv lamp and mpuv223nm were not significantly different even though the peak wavelength the half peak bandwidth and the uv source were not the same this approach agrees with hull and linden 2018 who suggested that action spectra and lamp emission spectra can be used to predict inactivation efficacy for the emerging uv sources this phenomenon was theoretically supported by the law of photochemistry bolton et al 2015 a photon that is absorbed by a molecule only causes an effective photochemical reaction the inactivation kinetics of uv irradiation will be determined by both uv wavelength and fluence the impact of the microplasma uv lamp and mpuv223nm on pathogens can be considered the same regardless of the uv source and experiment design therefore we can conclude that the inactivation rate constants by microplasma uv are similar to those by mpuv223nm 3 3 effective performance of microplasma uv for water disinfection the findings on adv inactivation and mechanisms showed that microplasma uv and mpuv223nm have the same effects on the viruses based on these findings we assume that the inactivation rate constants of bacteriophage ms2 rotavirus and tulane viruses by microplasma uv are the same as the constants measured previously by mpuv223nm table 1 lists the inactivation efficacy of adv bacteriophage ms2 rotavirus and tulane viruses by microplasma uv mpuv223nm and lpuv with the assumption of the same efficacy as mpuv223nm microplasma uv was expected to provide better inactivation of the four selected viruses than lpuv taking adv as an example the inactivation rate constant of monochromatic uv at 222 nm was 4 4 times higher than that of monochromatic uv at 254 nm 0 032 to 0 142 cm2 mj in agreement with our study linden et al 2007 and vazquez bravo et al 2018 reported that the germicidal factor of adv2 at 220 nm was 5 times higher than that of 254 nm the monochromatic uv at 222 nm was confirmed to be effective to the different viruses showing 1 2 2 3 and 2 4 times higher inactivation rate constants for tulane virus ms2 and rotavirus respectively compared to that of monochromatic 254 nm however note that there could exist other viruses that are more resistant to uv at 254 nm than 222 nm a microplasma uv lamp generated monochromatic uv at 222 nm primarily targeting adv capsid proteins while lpuv produced monochromatic uv at 254 nm mostly attacking the genome monochromatic uv at 222 nm was a better germicidal wavelength than that of 254 nm for inactivating a wide range of pathogens for the following two reasons first many viruses ms2 t1uv q beta t7m and t7 showed higher uv absorbance at 222 nm than at 254 nm beck et al 2015 uv absorbance of peptide bonds amino acids and proteins showed increasing tendency from 240 nm to 190 nm beaven and holiday 1952 goldfarb and saidel 1951 ham and platt 1952 rosenheck and doty 1961 these proteins are known to be the highest molecular component for microbial cells making up over 50 of the cell while dna makes up only 3 neidhardt et al 1990 the protein contents for viruses were even higher laine et al 1973 for example advs were known to have more than 85 of protein contents piña and green 1965 second protein damages are mostly irreparable chondrogianni et al 2014 in the case of dna damage however the dna repair system was well established to restore various types of uv induced dna lesions errol et al 2006 the noticeable resistance of advs to lpuv was also assumed to be the viral ability to exploit a dna repair machinery of a host cell gerrity et al 2008 ko et al 2005 3 4 energy efficiency comparison among the three types of uv lamps the energy consumption was analyzed to determine whether or not a microplasma uv lamp can be applied to uv irradiation systems for water disinfection energy consumption is known to be the most critical parameter for the economic and environmental impact of the uv irradiation system jones et al 2018 it was estimated that the relative energy efficiency of mpuv and microplasma uv to lpuv eq 6 with a scenario where a treatment credit for viruses 4 log reduction was assigned based solely on the uv irradiation system usepa 2008 the wall plug efficiency and water factor were determined in section 2 3 based on the fluence requirement for viruses the adv was the most resistant virus to lpuv mpuv and microplasma uv despite different germicidal wavelengths of the lamps thus the fluence requirements of mpuv and microplasma uv for viruses can be determined based on the adv inactivation experiments similar to the fact that the fluence requirement of lpuv for the viruses was also decided based on the adv inactivation experiment usepa 2006 in general lpuv was the most economical option to inactivate the three types of pathogens among the lamps table 2 because the wall plug efficiency and water factor of lpuv were the most favorable a microplasma uv lamp could be a promising option as a stand alone water disinfection technology where the treatment credit for viruses is assigned to uv irradiation while the uv led is currently considered to be the available uv lamp for the stand alone water disinfection oguma et al 2016 2013 a microplasma uv lamp is more advantageous in terms of the relative energy efficiency beck et al 2017 estimated the relative energy efficiency of uv led to lpuv for adv inactivation would be 90 8 76 9 and 87 3 when 260 nm 280 nm and 260 280 nm wavelength were applied respectively on the other hand the relative energy efficiency of the microplasma uv lamp for adv inactivation would decrease from 6 33 current study with an assumption of 5 cm water depth to 4 78 if the same water depth as that used by beck et al 2017 0 6 cm were applied the higher energy efficiency of microplasma was previously confirmed by ms2 inactivation experiment using a krcl excimer lamp producing 222 nm hull and linden 2018 the improvement of the relative energy efficiency of the microplasma uv lamp is due to the wall plug efficiency and efficient germicidal wavelength the wall plug efficiency of the uv led is known to decrease as the wavelength is shortened dramatically chen et al 2017 the most widely used wavelengths by uv led lamps for water disinfection are 260 nm and 280 nm and they had wall plug efficiencies of 0 004 and 0 005 beck et al 2017 although a uv led which generates far uvc 207 222 nm was invented its efficiencies were quite low e g 3 10 5 for 222 nm hirayama et al 2009 and 10 8 for 210 nm taniyasu et al 2006 on the other hand the microplasma uv lamp already achieved a much higher wall plug efficiency 0 015 of monochromatic wavelength at 222 nm than uv led in terms of the wall plug efficiency and effective germicidal wavelength a microplasma uv lamp seems the most advantageous option among the alternative lamps for instance if the wall plug efficiency of the microplasma uv lamp increases up to 0 084 then the energy efficiency of the microplasma uv lamp becomes higher than that of lpuv also the small and flat shape may have advantages when being applied for portable water purifiers 4 conclusions we evaluated the microplasma uv for adv inactivation kinetics and the lamp energy efficiency the set of molecular assays long range qpcr dnase binding and plaque assay was developed to study the kinetics and mechanisms of adv inactivation this study presented the first dose response with viral component integrities for a viral pathogen i e adv using the microplasma uv lamp microplasma uv and mpuv223nm showed an insignificant difference in adv inactivation suggesting that the peak wavelength of monochromatic uv and the fluence are the most important parameters in designing a water disinfection system using a microplasma uv lamp microplasma uv monochromatic uv at 222 nm showed 4 4 times higher inactivation rate constant than that of lpuv the microplasma uv was expected to be effective for other types of viruses due to its ability to target the capsid proteins instead of the genomes although the current wall plug efficiency would delay applying the microplasma uv lamp for water disinfection the efficient wavelength could facilitate the application of microplasma uv lamps as the technology improves we identified the following research that could further contribute to the potential application of microplasma uv in water and wastewater disinfection first energy efficiency could be improved by enhancing the wall plug efficiency of the microplasma uv lamp and finding the optimal design shape of the microplasma uv lamp e g small and thin shape chen et al 2017 second a life cycle assessment for the uv irradiation system can be conducted for better evaluation even though energy consumption was assumed to be the most critical parameter for the uv irradiation system the other consumables would significantly impact the environmental footprint for example microplasma uv lamps do not require toxic chemicals such as hg for the filling gas on the other hand the lamp price is currently relatively high compared to the other types of uv lamps thus the lamp price should be considered in designing a water treatment system third noticeable improvement in virus inactivation might allow the uv irradiation to be free from other disinfectants as secondary disinfectants for instance the chlorination is currently required not only for residual disinfectant but also for virus inactivation as a stand alone technology microplasma uv irradiation can be compared to the lpuv supported by chlorination finally since uv at 222 nm is near the vacuum uv region 200 nm where various radicals could be produced depending on the water matrix further study is necessary to evaluate

17564,this study evaluated the potential of a microplasma uv lamp as an alternative uv source to the current mercury based hg based uv lamp for water disinfection we developed a set of pcr based molecular assays long range qpcr dnase and binding assay to quantify the adenovirus genome capsid and fiber damage with a wide detection range 100 5 106 5 pfu ml we used these molecular assays to characterize adenovirus adv inactivation kinetics by microplasma uv that produced monochromatic uv at 222 nm we found that the inactivation rate constant 0 142 cm2 mj due to microplasma uv was 4 4 times higher than that of low pressure hg uv 0 032 cm2 mj this high efficacy was attributed to monochromatic uv wavelength at 222 nm damaging the adv capsid protein the results of these molecular assays also proved that microplasma uv and medium pressure hg uv with a bandpass filter at 223 nm mpuv223nm have a similar influence on adv p 0 05 we then estimated the relative energy efficiency of mpuv and microplasma uv to lpuv for 4 log reduction of the viruses we found that the microplasma uv resulted in higher inactivation rate constants for viruses than the current hg based uv consequently microplasma uv could be more energy efficient than low pressure hg uv for water disinfection if the wall plug efficiency of the microplasma uv lamp improved to 8 4 currently 1 5 therefore the microplasma uv lamp is a promising option for water disinfection graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplasma uv lamp monochromatic uv irradiation at 222 nm adenovirus water disinfection molecular mechanisms 1 introduction ultraviolet uv irradiation has been used increasingly for the disinfection of drinking water and wastewater treatment systems linden et al 2019 because of its advantages over chemical disinfectants in comparison to chlorination uv irradiation does not produce harmful disinfection byproducts dbps mitch et al 2003 while it shows much higher disinfection efficiency to protozoa such as cryptosporidium and giardia hijnen et al 2006 the compact size and wide spectrum of applicability of uv irradiation also allow it to be applied as a stand alone disinfectant in small non community systems where a residual disinfectant is not necessary dotson et al 2012 linden et al 2019 schalk et al 2006 the majority of public water treatment facilities 97 in the united states are classified as small systems usepa 2016 and uv irradiation has been considered for microbial disinfection in these systems linden et al 2019 uv irradiation has also been applied to a portable water purifier brownell et al 2008 therefore the global market for uv disinfection equipment is expected to expand by 2 8 billion by 2020 song et al 2016 low pressure uv lpuv lamps widely used for uv disinfection in water treatment plants are filled with mercury hg gas about 10 5 bar and use 40 500 w to generate monochromatic wavelength with a peak at 254 nm schalk et al 2006 lpuvs are very effective for inactivating cryptosporidium giardia and pathogenic bacteria while viruses are known to be less susceptible to this monochromatic wavelength chevrefils et al 2006 hijnen et al 2006 adenovirus adv is particularly resistant to lpuv irradiation and requires high energy consumption for sufficient disinfection yates et al 2006 the resistance of adv to the lpuv irradiation can also increase the possibility of selective survival potentially allowing the survival of viral species that are more resistant to uv irradiation at 254 nm rachmadi et al 2018 hg the filling material for the lpuv lamp is a hazardous chemical that may cause secondary contamination hou et al 2012 in addition the hg based uv lamps require about 30 minutes to warm up and stabilize the uv radiation this time requirement is regarded as an operational disadvantage song et al 2016 a medium pressure uv mpuv lamp has been proposed as a substitute for an lpuv lamp this lamp is also filled with a higher pressure of hg gas 1 6 bar and uses 0 4 60 kw to generate polychromatic wavelengths ranging from 200 to 800 nm schalk et al 2006 the polychromatic irradiation has a higher virus inactivation efficacy than the monochromatic irradiation at 254 nm chevrefils et al 2006 however a large portion of the input energy is used for generating irradiation outside the germicidal wavelength causing high temperature up to 950 c and low energy efficiency schalk et al 2006 a uv light emitting diode led lamp was also recently discovered as a new uv source the uv led lamp has various advantages of diversity in wavelength high energy efficiency short warm up time hg free materials and durability song et al 2016 however uv led has low emission power and narrow wavelength in germicidal uvc 260 285 nm würtele et al 2011 because of the different innate characteristics of uv lamps a synergistic effect with the available uv lamps were studied hull and linden 2018 beck et al 2017 from this perspective we first need to characterize emerging uv lamps with different uv wavelengths for their inactivation efficacies this information is required to assess the potential application of these lamps for the disinfection of water and wastewater treatment for example oguma et al 2016 reported that the inactivation rate constant of monochromatic uv at 285 nm by uv led for adenovirus type 5 was 15 higher than that by lpuv microplasma uv irradiation is an emerging technology with several advantages over hg filled uv technology the microplasma lamps have microcavities a few millimeters filled with krcl electrodes deliver time varying voltages which interact with the gas to irradiate monochromatic uv with a peak at 222 nm park et al 2019 different wavelengths can also be produced depending on the filling gases e g xe2 for 172 nm xecl for 308 nm these microplasma uv lamps do not contain toxic substances such as hg microplasma uv lamps can generate high power 115 mw with small 25 cm2 and thin 6 mm lamp designs for different configurations of disinfection herring and park 2019 the short stabilization time 15 s of the microplasma uv lamp allows intermittent disinfection a higher energy efficiency and a longer lifespan of the lamp raeiszadeh and taghipour 2019 these advantages of microplasma uv technology have the potential to overcome some shortcomings of the hg based uv lamps therefore the microplasma uv lamp has been adopted in the medical field in the semiconductor industry and for air purification herring and park 2019 welch et al 2018 however microplasma uv lamps have not been widely applied to inactivate viral pathogens for water and wastewater disinfection this is probably because the unique geometry and spectral irradiance of the microplasma uv lamp have not been tested with viral pathogens a study on the impact of the microplasma uv lamp on viral pathogens and comparison with commercially available uv lamps is needed the objective of this study was to characterize microplasma uv lamps as an alternative uv source for drinking water and wastewater disinfection we conducted two analyses first we developed a set of molecular assays to quantify the damage in the genome capsid protein fiber protein and infectivity of adv by microplasma uv irradiation adv was selected because it is known as one of the most resistant waterborne viruses to the current hg based uv lamps chevrefils et al 2006 hijnen et al 2006 the findings of these assays allowed us to understand why a microplasma uv lamp provided more efficient inactivation than the current hg based uv lamps second we compared the energy efficiencies of different uv lamps the higher rate constant for virus inactivation compared to the hg based uv lamps proposes the microplasma uv lamp as another viable option in designing a uv irradiation system therefore the study findings will contribute to the potential application of microplasma uv lamps in water and wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 adv inactivation experiments by uv irradiation 2 1 1 uv irradiation by a microplasma uv lamp a microplasma uv lamp eden park illumination usa had a 16 cm2 effective illuminating area in a 5 08 5 08 cm 2 2 in rectangular surface the lamp was connected to an electric circuit which was further connected to a wall plug to ensure the stability of the power source we used a special power supply designed by eden park illumination this power supply is capable of modulating input frequency voltage and current a power meter was connected between the adaptor and wall plug to monitor the consumed total power and a ensure well controlled power supply fig 1 the spectral irradiance of the microplasma uv showed a monochromatic uv peak at 222 nm with a full width at half maximum of 3 nm fig 1 the fluence applied to the adv solution by microplasma uv was calculated by the following equations suggested by raeiszadeh and taghipour 2019 1 f 200 300 e p f d f r f λ w f λ c f t d λ 2 d f 1 l d d 1 e x d x e d 3 r f λ 1 n 1 λ n 2 λ n 1 λ n 2 λ 2 4 w f λ 1 10 α λ l α λ l l n 10 in these equations f is the average fluence inside the adv solution mj cm2 e is the incident irradiance at the center of the solution surface mw cm2 pf was a petri factor which was the ratio of the incident irradiance at the center to the average incident over the solution surface the incident irradiance was measured by a uv power meter c9536 hamamatsu photonics with a uv power meter head h9535 hamamatsu photonics and pf was 0 906 0 951 and 0 968 for 4 5 5 and 7 cm distance between the lamp and the solution respectively df was a divergence factor which was defined as the ratio of irradiance inside the empty volume to be filled with adv solution during the experiment to the average irradiance at the solution surface df was calculated by eq 2 where d is the distance between the lamp and the solution surface l is the solution depth and e x is the uv irradiance at a certain distance dfs 0 5 cm water depth were 0 918 0 929 and 0 939 for 4 5 5 and 7 cm distance respectively rf was a reflection factor at which the uv reflection at the interface of two media with different reflective indices n 1 λ and n 2 λ was considered and it is calculated using the fresnel equation eq 3 cf was a collimation factor that was defined as the delivered irradiance to the fluence rate at the solution surface the delivered irradiance can be calculated by a radiometry measurement while the fluence rate at the solution surface can be determined by an actinometry experiment the cf values were adopted from raeiszadeh and taghipour 2019 which measured it under the same experimental setup i e microplasma uv lamp petri dish size and distance from the lamp by the actinometry assay the cf value for a 5 5 cm diameter dish with 4 5 5 and 7 cm distance were 0 926 0 972 and 0 996 wf was a water factor that addressed light attenuation in the solution wf was defined as the ratio of average fluence inside the adv solution to that at the solution surface eq 4 here αλ cm 1 was the absorption coefficient of the solution at each wavelength which was measured using a spectrophotometer uv 2450 shimadzu japan finally t was the exposure time s we conducted three virus inactivation experiments where the distance between the lamp and the solutions was 4 5 5 and 7 cm we found insignificant differences in the inactivation rate constants obtained with these three distances p 0 05 by mann whitney test fig s1 the four centimeter distance was selected for the inactivation experiments using the microplasma uv lamp so that the viral solutions could be exposed to similar irradiance as that of the mpuv223nm experiment the uv irradiance was about 0 05 mw cm2 at the center of the petri dish with a 4 cm distance from the lamp fig 1 the inactivation experiments were started with the preparation of 10 5 ml of the adv solution in the quartz dish followed by taking the first sample 0 5 ml before the lamp was turned on i e fluence was 0 mj cm2 once the quartz dish with adv solution 104 5 pfu ml was exposed to uv irradiation 0 5 ml of each sample was taken at certain time intervals for further analysis including long range qpcr dnase binding and plaque assay the changes in solution height were reflected in calculating the fluence by correcting wf and df every sampling time table s1 s2 and s3 the uv irradiation experiment was replicated at least three times independently 2 1 2 uv irradiation by an mpuv lamp with a bandpass filter the mpuv lamp calgon carbon co pittsburgh pa was installed in a 1 kw rayox collimated uv system for the uv irradiation experiments although the mpuv irradiated polychromatic uv wavelength ranged from 200 to 800 nm the monochromatic uv wavelength was produced by a bandpass filter andover corporation salem nh installed at the end of the collimator isolating wavelength of interest from the polychromatic wavelength the monochromatic wavelength from the mpuv with the bandpass filter produced spectral irradiance with a peak wavelength at 223 nm and a full width at half maximum of 4 nm fig 1 the mpuv with the bandpass filter will henceforth be referred to as the mpuv223nm for adv inactivation experiments the adv solution 104 5 pfu ml was put in a quartz petri dish 5 5 cm diameter and placed 50 cm away from the mpuv lamp similar to the microplasma uv experiment 0 5 ml of each sample taken at certain time intervals was subjected to long range qpcr dnase binding and plaque assays this distance provided the similar power of uv irradiance 0 05 mw cm2 which was applied to the microplasma uv experiment the fluence inside the adv solution was determined based on the previously suggested protocol bolton and linden 2003 the equation below was used to calculate the fluence this equation was also used for the microplasma uv lamp excluding cf because the collimator was assumed to ensure cf 1 i e complete collimation pf and df were 0 852 and 0 992 in this study respectively 5 f 200 300 e p f d f r f λ w f λ t d λ 2 2 molecular assays to reveal adv inactivation efficacy and mechanisms 2 2 1 virus propagation and cell culture the human lung carcinoma cell line a549 ccl 185 was obtained from american type culture collection atcc va usa the cells were cultured in 175 cm2 flasks thermo scientific nh usa until the monolayer showed 80 100 confluency using ham f 12 media with 10 fetal bovine serum fbs thermo fisher scientific ma usa and 1x antibiotic antimycotic thermo fisher scientific ma usa these cells were either cultured for the new passage or used for further experiments including virus propagation binding assay and plaque assay human adenovirus type 2 vr 846 was also obtained from atcc the advs were propagated and purified for the inactivation experiment as follows first a549 cells with 80 100 confluency were prepared in a 175 cm2 flask after removing the media 2 ml of adv solution was added to the flask and incubated at 37 c with 5 co2 for 90 min to facilitate virus particle attachment to the host cells after providing 20 ml of ham f 12 media with 2 fbs and 1x antibiotic antimycotic the flask was incubated for 5 days for the viruses to make progenies the viruses were separated from the a549 cells by three cycles of freezing and thawing the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 2000 rpm 556 g for 10 min sorvall legend rt plus thermo fisher scientific ma usa followed by filtration through a 0 45 µm filter millipore sigma ma usa the viruses were further separated from impurities such as proteins and nutrients using ultracentrifuge optima xpn 90 ultracentrifuge beckman coulter ca usa a mix of 50 ml of the virus solution and 10 ml of the 40 sucrose solution thermo fisher scientific ma usa was placed in a sterilized ultracentrifuge tube the ultracentrifuge was then run at 1000 rpm 116 g at 4 c for 5 min followed by 36000 rpm 150700 g at 4 c for 3 hours the supernatant was removed and the virus pellet on the bottom of the ultracentrifuge tube was resuspended in 1x pbs thermo fisher scientific ma usa and stored in 80 c until use 2 2 2 long range qpcr assay to determine genomic damage it is widely known that uv irradiation induces non specific dna lesions errol et al 2006 so the longer amplicon size is preferred for identifying the uv induced dna damage rodríguez et al 2013 however the amplicon size that conventional qpcr can measure is less than 150 bp which is too short compared to the adv genome size about 36 kbp thus we developed a long range qpcr assay consisting of two sequential pcr steps where long range amplicons 10 kbp were synthesized in the first step and then short range amplicons 115 bp were replicated from the first pcr product and quantified by qpcr in the second step dna was extracted from adv before and after exposure to uv irradiation using qiaamp viral rna mini kit qiagen germany following the manufacturer s protocol the first pcr step for the long range amplicon synthesis was conducted with 2 µl of the extracted dna and 23 µl of pcr mixture from the longamp taq pcr kit new england biolabs ma usa the pcr cycle consisted of initial denaturation at 94 c for 30 s 15 cycles of denaturation at 94 c for 30 s annealing at 55 c for 60 s and extension at 65 c at 10 min and the final extension at 65 c for 10 min the first pcr product had mainly long range 10 kbp amplicons with a minor amount of single stranded dna and primers the synthesis of long range amplicons was confirmed by gel electrophoresis after 30 cycles of the first pcr step fig s2 in the second step qpcr was used for the quantification of long range amplicons from the first pcr product since the incomplete amplicons ssdna and the remaining primers in the first pcr product would affect the second qpcr step the impurities were removed by s1 nuclease thermo scientific nh usa and subsequent qiaquick pcr purification kit qiagen germany a mix of 5 µl of the first pcr product 0 1 µl of s1 nuclease 6 µl of 5x reaction buffer and 18 9 of µl nuclease free water was incubated at 37 c for 30 min immediately after the s1 nuclease reaction for the ssdna degradation was completed the pcr purification kit was applied to the mixture following the manufacturer s protocol to remove the primers and obtain 50 µl of the purified pcr product the long range dsdna was quantified by qpcr using a pair of primers targeting a 115 bp fragment on the 10 kbp long range dsdna a mix of 2 µl of the purified pcr product 5 0 µl of powerup sybr green master mix applied biosystems ca usa 0 3 µl of the reverse primer 0 3 µl of the forward primer and 2 4 µl of molecular biology grade water corning ny usa was prepared the qpcr step was run under the following conditions initial denaturation at 95 c for 10 min 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 15 s annealing and extension at 60 c for 1 min and temperature increase for melting curve from 65 c to 95 c an oligonucleotide 360 bp covering the qpcr amplicon 115 bp was designed idt corporation nj and the copy number was measured using a qubit fluorometer invitrogen ca usa for the absolute quantification of the pcr product every qpcr was run with 10 fold serial dilutions of the known concentration of the oligonucleotide the qpcr result was represented as an average value of at least three technical replications and pcr efficiency was higher than 85 throughout this research detailed information about the primers and amplicons are presented in table s4 2 2 3 dnase assay to determine viral capsid damage we developed a deoxyribonuclease dnase assay to check the adv capsid integrity it was assumed that dnase could not penetrate an intact viral capsid but once the capsid is damaged dnase can enter the virus and degrade its genomic dna this assay included a dnase reaction for dna degradation of capsid damaged virions and a subsequent long range qpcr for quantifying the dna degradation by dnase activity first the 50 µl virus samples were exposed to 2 µl of dnase with 10 µl of 10x dnase buffer and 38 µl of rnase free water dnase max kit qiagen germany after the mixture was incubated at 37 c for 40 min 10 µl of dnase removal resin was added to the mixture and incubated at room temperature for 10 min with regular resuspension for homogenization the mixture was centrifuged at 13300 rpm 17000 g for 1 min to separate the resin from the solution seventy microliters of dnase treated virus solution were taken and the genome integrity was quantified by the long range qpcr described in section 2 2 2 capsid damage was then determined based on the reduction in dna copy number caused by dnase activity 2 2 4 binding assay to determine viral fiber damage we conducted a binding assay that was slightly modified from vazquez bravo et al 2018 to evaluate adv fiber integrity which is an essential protein to bind to receptor proteins e g coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor on the host cell membrane for this assay a549 cells were used as host cells the a549 cell monolayers were prepared on 6 well plates usa scientific fl usa with 80 100 confluency the cells were inoculated with 200 µl of the virus solution and then incubated at room temperature for 90 min the plates were gently shaken every 15 min to facilitate the virus particle attachment then each well was washed three times with 1 ml of 1x pbs to remove unbound virions the virus particles bound to cells were dislodged using 200 µl of 0 05 trypsin edta thermo fisher scientific ma usa and the trypsin activity was quenched using 1 ml of ham s f12 k media with 10 fbs the solution was centrifuged at 13300 rpm 17000 g for 10 min the supernatant was removed and the virus particles bound to cells were resuspended in 200 µl 1x pbs finally the virus particles bound to the host cells were quantified by qpcr table s4 after dna extraction the number of housekeeping genes β actin in a549 cells was also measured by qpcr to check if the ratio of host cells to viruses in this experiment impacts the binding assay result thermal cycling conditions for the housekeeping gene quantification were the same as the adv qpcr 1 cycle of 95 c for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 1 min detailed information for primers and qpcr conditions were presented in table s5 and section 2 2 2 2 2 5 plaque assay to determine viral infectivity we developed a plaque assay to determine adv infectivity a549 cell monolayers were prepared on 6 well plates with 80 100 confluency the virus solutions to be assayed were serially diluted with ham s f12 k media without fbs the media in each well was aspirated and 400 µl of each adv dilution was inoculated into the cells the plates containing the cells and viruses were incubated at 37 c and 5 co2 for 90 min the plates were gently shaken every 15 min to facilitate the virus particle attachment the solution in each well was aspirated again and the cells with viruses were covered by 2 ml overlay solution which was prepared by mixing 1 31 ml of 2x minimum essential medium thermo fisher scientific ma usa 0 01 ml of 100x antibiotic antimycotic 0 05 ml of 15 mm hepes 0 03 ml of 7 5 sodium bicarbonate 0 5 ml of 1 agarose solution and 0 1 ml of fbs after solidifying the overlay solution at 4 c for about 20 min the plates were incubated at 37 c with 5 co2 for 5 days two milliliters of the 10 formaldehyde solution in pbs was put into each well and left at room temperature for two hours to fix the cells on the plate surface after removing the overlay the plaques were stained with 0 05 crystal violet in 10 ethanol for visualization fig s3 2 2 6 reliability confirmation for the molecular assays we confirmed the reliability of the three molecular assays long range qpcr dnase and binding and plaque assay by conducting calibration curves to show the relationship between virus titer and the outcome from each assay for calibration curves 10 fold serial dilutions of adv 100 5 106 5 pfu ml were prepared from the concentrated and purified intact adv these serially diluted solutions were then subjected to long range qpcr binding assay and plaque assay it was assumed here that the levels of the intact genome fiber and infectivity were also divided by 10 fold in the serial dilutions on the other hand the dnase assay was designed to quantify the capsid damaged adv not the intact capsid still the serial dilutions of intact adv cannot provide the concentration of the capsid damaged adv samples in the case of the dnase assay the enzyme activity of dna degradation depending on the shielding effect of capsid proteins was measured thus the intact virus samples before and after dna extraction were exposed to the enzyme to see the change in the dna copy number all results were obtained from the experiments with three distinct virus samples 3 biological replications followed by three separate qpcr measurements 3 technical replications 2 3 the relative energy efficiency of a uv lamp electricity consumption for uv irradiation will vary with the application sites because of the different designs of the uv reactor the electricity consumption obtained from laboratory experiments cannot directly be used to represent the energy consumption for field applications a uv reactor for a laboratory experiment is designed to provide uniform uv irradiation so that the reliable values of fluence can be calculated e g collimated beam apparatus in contrast a uv reactor for field application is designed to efficiently deliver the generated uv photons to the target molecules in water e g cylinder shape although enough information for the lpuv has been accumulated from the field application to estimate the electricity consumption the information on mpuv and microplasma uv lamp is limited because they have not been widely used in the field sharpless and linden 2005 suggested a relative energy efficiency by applying the results from a laboratory experiment with a collimated beam apparatus to estimate the electricity consumption of a uv reactor in the field the relative energy efficiency of mpuv and microplasma uv lamps to lpuv lamps in the field scale can be estimated from the inactivation rate constant the wall plug efficiency and the water factor wf assuming that the uv reactor designs are the same eq 6 6 e m i c r o p l a s m a e l p k l p k m i c r o p l a s m a c l p c m i c r o p l a s m a w f l p w f m i c r o p l a s m a the inactivation rate constants cm2 mj were determined from the experiment for inactivation kinetics and calculated using eqs 7 9 for example k was used for an inactivation rate constant which was a slope of the inactivation kinetics with log n0 n as the y axis 7 d n d t k i n 8 l n n n 0 k i t 9 l o g 10 n 0 n k f n refers to viral infectivity and the subscript indicates exposure time i indicated the uv incidence mw cm2 t was exposure time and f was a fluence mj cm2 the wall plug efficiencies for low and medium pressure uv were obtained from previous work sharpless and linden 2005 and the one for microplasma uv was provided by the manufacturer wf was the water factor weighed by photon energy over the germicidal wavelength 200 300 nm according to eqs 10 11 wf is determined by a reactor design penetration depth l water quality uv absorbance aλ lamp properties spectral irradiance ρλ we measured the spectral irradiance for the three lamps the penetration depth was assumed to be 5 cm for the three uv lamps based on the typical reactor design for drinking water and wastewater disinfection sozzi and taghipour 2006 also the uv absorbance of surface water thomas et al 1996 fig s4 was assumed for the wf calculation the relative energy efficiency with the inactivation rate constant wall plug efficiency and wf is explained further in section 3 4 10 w f λ ρ λ u λ w f λ λ ρ λ u λ

compare the impact of uv irradiation to the genome capsid protein fiber protein and infectivity over fluence and the impact of microplasma uv and mpuv223nm over fluence analysis of variance anova was conducted to compare two groups of means the significance level was assumed to be α 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 reliability of molecular assays the long range qpcr assay was designed to determine adv genome integrity the copy number from the long range qpcr was presented with the infectivity of the initial virus solution fig 2 the calibration curve showed a strong linear correlation between the initial viral infectivity and the outcome from long range qpcr r2 0 97 the slope of this correlation was 1 00 in the range from 100 5 to 106 5 pfu ml suggesting the long range qpcr has properly quantified the intact genome thus the long range qpcr was reliable in the range from about 100 5 to 106 5 pfu ml and all subsequent experiments were conducted within this range the dnase assay was developed to determine the viral capsid integrity the mean diameter of dnase was estimated to be 4 2 nm erickson 2009 islan et al 2017 based on its shape and molecular weight chen and liao 2006 zijlstra et al 2009 we assumed that the dnase could degrade the dsdna of the adv only when the virus particles have capsid damages that are greater than 4 2 nm so that the dnase can penetrate the viral capsid and degrade the viral dna otherwise the viral capsid will protect dna from contact with dnase for verification two types of samples were prepared intact adv solution and naked dna extracted from the adv solution the only difference between the two samples was the existence of the viral capsid protecting the same dna copy number fig 3 then the two samples were exposed to either the resin alone or dnase followed by resin which was originally supposed to quench dnase activity to determine the function of dnase and resin for dna degradation in other words dnase activity was calculated by subtracting the resin effect r in fig 3 from the effect of both dnase and resin d r in fig 3 to dna degradation as a result dnase activity for dna degradation was negligible when they are protected by capsid i e adv solution in contrast the activity became significant p 0 05 when dna was exposed to dnase i e naked dna therefore dnase assay can selectively quantify the virus with the damaged capsid which allows dnase to encounter dna the reliable range of dnase was assumed to be similar to that of long range qpcr 100 5 106 5 pfu ml because the reduction in dna copy number was measured by long range qpcr assay a binding assay was applied to determine fiber integrity assuming advs with intact fibers can only bind to a549 cells and avoid being detached the copy numbers of advs bound to a549 cells were measured by qpcr and presented with initial viral infectivity fig 4 the log copy number of advs bound to the host cells linearly decreased with the initial viral concentrations from 106 5 to 102 5 pfu ml and reached a constant level when the initial viral concentrations were between 101 5 and 102 5 pfu ml fig 4a the reason for the constant virus copy number in the low concentration might be attributed to the non specific binding of advs to host cells page et al 2010 the adv copy number was also normalized to the number of a549 cells fig 4b the two graphs in fig 4 were similar to each other p 0 05 indicating that the ratio of a549 to adv did not significantly affect the binding assay results in this range of experiments these results can be explained by the similar numbers of a549 cells within each well about 105 106 these numbers of cells were enough to accommodate the virus particles less than 108 considering that one a549 cell can hold more than 104 advs wu et al 2003 3 2 adv inactivation kinetics and mechanisms by microplasma uv solutions of adv were exposed to microplasma uv irradiation and both the inactivation efficiency and mechanism were evaluated by the set of molecular assays as shown in fig 5 the experiment was repeated with a different uv irradiance 0 10 mw cm2 at the center of the solution with 4 cm distance from the lamp and the results showed no significant difference p 0 05 fig s5 this result confirmed that the microplasma uv irradiation kinetics could be normalized by the product i t referred to as fluence in this study eqs 7 9 the adv inactivation rate constant which was shown in the slope of the infectivity loss over the fluence was 0 142 cm2 mj among the three viral components the capsid damage explained the 3 log10 infectivity loss p 0 05 while genome and fiber damages were significantly different from infectivity loss p 0 05 the molecular assays indicated that microplasma uv irradiation mostly attacked the capsid proteins to inactivate adv this observation can be explained by the overlapping of the uv absorbance of capsid proteins with the microplasma uv wavelength these results agree with a previous study using a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis assay to report that the monochromatic uv damaged about 40 of the hexon and penton proteins at 220 nm of 22 7 mj cm2 beck et al 2018 genome damage increased up to about 1 log of reduction as fluence increased until about 5 mj cm2 before reaching saturation this saturation was also confirmed with the naked dna sample fig s6 this plateau was attributed to the reversibility of the lesion of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers cpds the most common lesion caused by uvc irradiation the cpds formation follows a pseudo zero order reaction in contrast the reversal reaction conforms to a first order reaction so the two reactions reach an equilibrium state at a certain concentration of cpds in the adv genome errol et al 2006 the fiber damage was not significantly different from the negative control p 0 05 at fluences of less than 21 2 mj cm2 this observation meant monochromatic uv at 222 nm is not effective to degrade the viral fiber proteins a similar trend was also confirmed by beck et al 2018 showing fiber damage was negligible at fluences less than 22 7 mj cm2 of monochromatic uv irradiation at 220 nm generated by a deuterium uv lamp with a bandpass filter the results of the molecular assays also provided knowledge on the damage patterns on adv these damage patterns were a unique consequence of the uv irradiation because each assay directly measured the damage on the virus particles therefore the damage patterns on advs can play a role as a fingerprint for certain disinfectants we confirmed that the infectivity loss by mpuv223nm was not significantly different p 0 05 from that by microplasma uv and the primary damage occurred to the capsid fig s7 thus the inactivation efficacies and mechanisms by microplasma uv lamp and mpuv223nm were not significantly different even though the peak wavelength the half peak bandwidth and the uv source were not the same this approach agrees with hull and linden 2018 who suggested that action spectra and lamp emission spectra can be used to predict inactivation efficacy for the emerging uv sources this phenomenon was theoretically supported by the law of photochemistry bolton et al 2015 a photon that is absorbed by a molecule only causes an effective photochemical reaction the inactivation kinetics of uv irradiation will be determined by both uv wavelength and fluence the impact of the microplasma uv lamp and mpuv223nm on pathogens can be considered the same regardless of the uv source and experiment design therefore we can conclude that the inactivation rate constants by microplasma uv are similar to those by mpuv223nm 3 3 effective performance of microplasma uv for water disinfection the findings on adv inactivation and mechanisms showed that microplasma uv and mpuv223nm have the same effects on the viruses based on these findings we assume that the inactivation rate constants of bacteriophage ms2 rotavirus and tulane viruses by microplasma uv are the same as the constants measured previously by mpuv223nm table 1 lists the inactivation efficacy of adv bacteriophage ms2 rotavirus and tulane viruses by microplasma uv mpuv223nm and lpuv with the assumption of the same efficacy as mpuv223nm microplasma uv was expected to provide better inactivation of the four selected viruses than lpuv taking adv as an example the inactivation rate constant of monochromatic uv at 222 nm was 4 4 times higher than that of monochromatic uv at 254 nm 0 032 to 0 142 cm2 mj in agreement with our study linden et al 2007 and vazquez bravo et al 2018 reported that the germicidal factor of adv2 at 220 nm was 5 times higher than that of 254 nm the monochromatic uv at 222 nm was confirmed to be effective to the different viruses showing 1 2 2 3 and 2 4 times higher inactivation rate constants for tulane virus ms2 and rotavirus respectively compared to that of monochromatic 254 nm however note that there could exist other viruses that are more resistant to uv at 254 nm than 222 nm a microplasma uv lamp generated monochromatic uv at 222 nm primarily targeting adv capsid proteins while lpuv produced monochromatic uv at 254 nm mostly attacking the genome monochromatic uv at 222 nm was a better germicidal wavelength than that of 254 nm for inactivating a wide range of pathogens for the following two reasons first many viruses ms2 t1uv q beta t7m and t7 showed higher uv absorbance at 222 nm than at 254 nm beck et al 2015 uv absorbance of peptide bonds amino acids and proteins showed increasing tendency from 240 nm to 190 nm beaven and holiday 1952 goldfarb and saidel 1951 ham and platt 1952 rosenheck and doty 1961 these proteins are known to be the highest molecular component for microbial cells making up over 50 of the cell while dna makes up only 3 neidhardt et al 1990 the protein contents for viruses were even higher laine et al 1973 for example advs were known to have more than 85 of protein contents piña and green 1965 second protein damages are mostly irreparable chondrogianni et al 2014 in the case of dna damage however the dna repair system was well established to restore various types of uv induced dna lesions errol et al 2006 the noticeable resistance of advs to lpuv was also assumed to be the viral ability to exploit a dna repair machinery of a host cell gerrity et al 2008 ko et al 2005 3 4 energy efficiency comparison among the three types of uv lamps the energy consumption was analyzed to determine whether or not a microplasma uv lamp can be applied to uv irradiation systems for water disinfection energy consumption is known to be the most critical parameter for the economic and environmental impact of the uv irradiation system jones et al 2018 it was estimated that the relative energy efficiency of mpuv and microplasma uv to lpuv eq 6 with a scenario where a treatment credit for viruses 4 log reduction was assigned based solely on the uv irradiation system usepa 2008 the wall plug efficiency and water factor were determined in section 2 3 based on the fluence requirement for viruses the adv was the most resistant virus to lpuv mpuv and microplasma uv despite different germicidal wavelengths of the lamps thus the fluence requirements of mpuv and microplasma uv for viruses can be determined based on the adv inactivation experiments similar to the fact that the fluence requirement of lpuv for the viruses was also decided based on the adv inactivation experiment usepa 2006 in general lpuv was the most economical option to inactivate the three types of pathogens among the lamps table 2 because the wall plug efficiency and water factor of lpuv were the most favorable a microplasma uv lamp could be a promising option as a stand alone water disinfection technology where the treatment credit for viruses is assigned to uv irradiation while the uv led is currently considered to be the available uv lamp for the stand alone water disinfection oguma et al 2016 2013 a microplasma uv lamp is more advantageous in terms of the relative energy efficiency beck et al 2017 estimated the relative energy efficiency of uv led to lpuv for adv inactivation would be 90 8 76 9 and 87 3 when 260 nm 280 nm and 260 280 nm wavelength were applied respectively on the other hand the relative energy efficiency of the microplasma uv lamp for adv inactivation would decrease from 6 33 current study with an assumption of 5 cm water depth to 4 78 if the same water depth as that used by beck et al 2017 0 6 cm were applied the higher energy efficiency of microplasma was previously confirmed by ms2 inactivation experiment using a krcl excimer lamp producing 222 nm hull and linden 2018 the improvement of the relative energy efficiency of the microplasma uv lamp is due to the wall plug efficiency and efficient germicidal wavelength the wall plug efficiency of the uv led is known to decrease as the wavelength is shortened dramatically chen et al 2017 the most widely used wavelengths by uv led lamps for water disinfection are 260 nm and 280 nm and they had wall plug efficiencies of 0 004 and 0 005 beck et al 2017 although a uv led which generates far uvc 207 222 nm was invented its efficiencies were quite low e g 3 10 5 for 222 nm hirayama et al 2009 and 10 8 for 210 nm taniyasu et al 2006 on the other hand the microplasma uv lamp already achieved a much higher wall plug efficiency 0 015 of monochromatic wavelength at 222 nm than uv led in terms of the wall plug efficiency and effective germicidal wavelength a microplasma uv lamp seems the most advantageous option among the alternative lamps for instance if the wall plug efficiency of the microplasma uv lamp increases up to 0 084 then the energy efficiency of the microplasma uv lamp becomes higher than that of lpuv also the small and flat shape may have advantages when being applied for portable water purifiers 4 conclusions we evaluated the microplasma uv for adv inactivation kinetics and the lamp energy efficiency the set of molecular assays long range qpcr dnase binding and plaque assay was developed to study the kinetics and mechanisms of adv inactivation this study presented the first dose response with viral component integrities for a viral pathogen i e adv using the microplasma uv lamp microplasma uv and mpuv223nm showed an insignificant difference in adv inactivation suggesting that the peak wavelength of monochromatic uv and the fluence are the most important parameters in designing a water disinfection system using a microplasma uv lamp microplasma uv monochromatic uv at 222 nm showed 4 4 times higher inactivation rate constant than that of lpuv the microplasma uv was expected to be effective for other types of viruses due to its ability to target the capsid proteins instead of the genomes although the current wall plug efficiency would delay applying the microplasma uv lamp for water disinfection the efficient wavelength could facilitate the application of microplasma uv lamps as the technology improves we identified the following research that could further contribute to the potential application of microplasma uv in water and wastewater disinfection first energy efficiency could be improved by enhancing the wall plug efficiency of the microplasma uv lamp and finding the optimal design shape of the microplasma uv lamp e g small and thin shape chen et al 2017 second a life cycle assessment for the uv irradiation system can be conducted for better evaluation even though energy consumption was assumed to be the most critical parameter for the uv irradiation system the other consumables would significantly impact the environmental footprint for example microplasma uv lamps do not require toxic chemicals such as hg for the filling gas on the other hand the lamp price is currently relatively high compared to the other types of uv lamps thus the lamp price should be considered in designing a water treatment system third noticeable improvement in virus inactivation might allow the uv irradiation to be free from other disinfectants as secondary disinfectants for instance the chlorination is currently required not only for residual disinfectant but also for virus inactivation as a stand alone technology microplasma uv irradiation can be compared to the lpuv supported by chlorination finally since uv at 222 nm is near the vacuum uv region 200 nm where various radicals could be produced depending on the water matrix further study is necessary to evaluate
