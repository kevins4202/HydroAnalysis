12050,oases are complex ecosystems with permanent water bodies springs and vegetated areas which are located in areas where the frequency of rain is a critical factor for the maintenance and subsistence of flora and fauna these ecosystems have been of great importance providing resources for the settlement of human societies in addition to the natural stress to which they are confronted oases are facing pressures related to coastal development and climate change new research is necessary to understand the effects of these pressures to define strategies to promote mitigation measures to limit their deterioration in this paper we proposed a multi criteria methodology to define and quantify recent and future pressures to an oasis affected by climate change and coastal development and the definition of priority areas for the installation of mitigation and adaptation measures this methodology was applied to todos santos oasis one of the most important wetlands in baja california sur state which has been affected in recent years by coastal development the results indicate that the integration of modflow models ccrp index chemistry data and geospatial analysis provides effective tools to generate information on the possible future of oases contributing greatly to land planning nature conservation and sustainable management of these ecosystems graphical abstract

irrigation and climate change kløve et al 2014 especially in arid and semiarid areas where droughts are common cui and shao 2005 oases are vegetated areas of the desert with permanent bodies of water or springs located in arid and semi arid areas that play a central role in the settlement of human societies and reproduction of both animal and plant species wang et al 2010 zhou and lei 2018 climatically the spatial distribution of oases can be attributed to the regional physiographic conditions and the large scale hydrological cycle zhou and lei 2018 they are complex and fragile ecosystems where landscapes depend mainly on the structure of desert stream components as a result they are highly dependent on freshwater inflows making them sensitive to water shortages and reductions of water levels el khoumsi et al 2014 guo et al 2019 the aquifers of these oases are vulnerable to subtle perturbations influxes which can be exacerbated by global warming and human activities liu et al 2018 the anthropogenic activity also adds pressure to this invaluable ecosystem king and thomas 2014 wurl et al 2014 mokadem et al 2015 guo et al 2019 the study of oases is a complex task because its dynamics depend on several interconnected variables various researches have been carried out to investigate different aspects of processes related to oases most of them based on the current conditions e g hydrogeological processes el khoumsi et al 2014 li et al 2017 liu et al 2018 water chemistry mokadem et al 2015 mahlknecht et al 2018 land use evolution king and thomas 2014 however in a dynamic world where threats evolve over time it is vitally important to have tools to quantify their effect in the coming years considering different disciplines in this paper we propose a multi criteria analysis to quantify recent and future deterioration of an oasis that is subject to coastal developments and climate change impacts as a case study we selected the todos santos oasis one of the most important and less studied oasis in the southern baja california peninsula anthropogenic activities related to tourism development agriculture and extreme natural events are threatening the functioning of this ecosystem álvarez arellano and gaitán morán 2014 2 material and methods 2 1 study area todos santos oasis is located within the todos santos watershed in the southern portion of the peninsula of baja california within the municipality of la paz that forms part of the mexican state of baja california sur fig 1 the oases in the region have been and still are of great importance for the development of the population providing resources fomenting landscaping and generating a cultural center of great importance in the state rodríguez estrella 2004 the extension of the todos santos watershed is approximately 66 km2 the climate is characterized by semi arid conditions with average annual temperatures ranging from 15 4 c to 27 3 c with a mean of 21 3 c mahlknecht et al 2018 according to the mexican national water commission conagua the average annual rainfall is only 151 mm year conagua 2018a summer rains are usually of high intensity and short duration as a result of the approach of tropical cyclones the mainstream in the watershed is la reforma arroyo with a length of approximately 15 km it flows within the oasis ending in a lagoon called poza todos santos ptsl a coastal lagoon with an area of 3 45ha and a maximum depth of 2 m the oasis has two major springs that used to have a constant flow el cerrito and san juan castillo maldonado 2014 in years with intense rainfall which are usually related to the approach of tropical cyclones in summer la reforma arroyo flows through the oasis during several months castillo maldonado 2014 the natural vegetation in the oasis consists mainly of washingtonia robusta palm phragmites communis carrizo and typha dominguesis tule castillo maldonado 2014 the urban area of todos santos town with a population of 5148 inhabitants inegi 2010 adjoins the oasis the most important economic activities in the area are agriculture and tourism according to mahlknecht et al 2018 670ha were planted during the autumn winter cycle from 2014 to 2015 todos santos public domestic water supply comes from 4 wells while agriculture and industrial water supply come from 15 wells conagua 2018a and as diverted surface water from la reforma creek 2 1 1 geological and hydrogeological setting from a geologic perspective todos santos oasis is located on the western portion of the la paz plutonic complex lpcc the lpcc is mainly composed of plutonic intrusive and metamorphic rocks ranging from late jurassic to cretaceous aranda gómez y pérez venzor 1989 on the eastern side of the lpcc there is a system of horst and grabens related to the gulf of california extensional province these tectonic basins are filled with terrigenous and marine rocks from the late miocene to recent holocene sediments aranda gómez y pérez venzor 1989 sgm 2001 in the todos santos area two main geological units are observed the oldest unit is the todos santos crystalline complex tscc with an estimated age of late jurassic cretaceous it is composed of gneiss mylonites and phyllites with minor outcrops of tonalities these rocks outcrop in the hills around todos santos oasis and near the coast aranda gómez y pérez venzor 1989 sgm 2001 mahlknecht et al 2018 erosion of the mountain range and surrounding hills filled the todos santos valley with alluvial sediments composed by sedimentary rocks sandstones limestones conglomerates with ages from pliocene pleistocene and sediments from the holocene aranda gomez y perez venzor 1989 sgm 2001 mahlknecht et al 2018 two main types of aquifers can be distinguished in the area fractured aquifers of limited permeability corresponding to tscc rocks and porous aquifers with low to moderate permeability conformed of alluvial and coastal sediments according to conagua 2018a the porous units of the todos santos aquifer are considered the main aquifer which is characterized as unconfined with transmissivity values ranging from 2 6 to 84 8 103 m2 s the depth to basement is in a range of 10 60 m according to conagua 2018a meanwhile mahlknecht et al 2018 define a maximum thickness of 100 m the aquifer mean annual recharge is 18 4 106 m3 and the mean annual availability of water is 0 08 106 m3 which indicates that officially the aquifer is not overexploited conagua 2018a however water levels have dropped an annual average of 0 92 m with a standard deviation of 0 5 m for the period 2010 2017 mahlknecht et al 2018 identified three main hydrochemical groups of groundwater the first group with electrical conductivity ec values of 433 31 μs cm is located in the recharge areas north of todos santos group 2 representing more mineralized waters with ec values of 1049 231 μs cm are related to transitory groundwater flow through alluvial deposits finally the third group rich in na cl and ec values ranging from 16 900 to 32 100 μs cm are mostly located near the coastline and poza todos santos 2 1 2 climate change scenarios for the study area global and regional circulation models and climate change studies predict changes in rainfall patterns for the region kirtman et al 2013 proposed reductions of no cyclonic rains of up to 10 for a representative concentration pathway rcp of 4 5 while imta 2015 forecasted changes of up to 37 for the scenario rcp 6 0 intensification of summer rains and runoffs of up to 10 are predicted kirtman et al 2013 romero vadillo and romero vadillo 2012 due to global warming ojeda bustamante et al 2011 proposed for northwest mexico an increment of evapotranspiration of 10 a1b for the year 2100 while mundo molina 2015 defined an increment of 2 7 a1b for the year 2050 according to a detailed compilation presented by church et al 2013 sea level will rise in a range of 0 16 1 6 m for the year 2100 under different rcp scenarios however vermeer and rahmstorf 2009 forecasted a maximum rise of 1 9 m a2 for the same year predictions considering climate change and storm surges in the united states forecast a sea level rise up to 4 6 m for 2050 melillo et al 2014 2 2 evolution of land use and salinity of todos santos oasis to estimate the evolution of land use in the oasis and extension of the poza todos santos lagoon a spatial analysis was performed using satellite imagery landsat 8 and digital globe images with a resolution of 10 m for years 2002 and 2018 were uploaded in qgis 3 0 permitting to estimate the coverage of urban areas planted parcels natural landscapes and the extension of the lagoon the rate of change within time steps of 10 years was calculated and then forecasted to the year 2040 the behavior of salinity in the aquifer was assessed considering data obtained from conagua 2018c for the period 2015 2018 salinity in the lagoon was characterized by performing on site measurements using a hanna calibrated equipment and a refractometer 2 3 groundwater model due to the importance of groundwater in the water budget of the oasis a modflow model was built to understand the depletion of water levels the behavior of seawater intrusion to the lagoon and to calculate the ecological flow the model was constructed with model muse winston 2009 developed by the united states geological survey usgs for the modflow 2005 algorithm harbaugh et al 2000 this program simulates steady and transient flows in confined or unconfined aquifers or a combination of them the governing equation used by modflow 2005 is 1 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z w s s h t where h denotes the potentiometric head m k denotes the hydraulic conductivity m d ss denotes the specific storage of the porous material m 1 w denotes the volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources and or sinks of water m3 d the model was calibrated for the period 2010 2017 dividing each year into three periods representing the average behavior of rainfall in the area dry season 180 days and wet season 60 days of cyclonic rains 125 days of non cyclonic rains 2 3 1 conceptual mathematical model design the groundwater model domain included three natural boundaries the coastline of the pacific ocean simulated as general head conditions fractured aquitards of the surrounding hills defined as a no flow condition to simulate the underground inflow from the northern aquifers a recharge zone was defined in the northeastern boundary of the model fig 2 using a finite difference approach the mesh consisted of two layers with cell sizes of 25 25m near the coastline and 50 50 m in the rest of the model area with an extension of 28 km2 the starting heads of the model were defined for the year 2010 based on the water levels provided by conagua 2018b the top of the aquifer was obtained from the 30 m digital elevation model aster gdem re sampled to 25 m the granitic basement and the thickness of the layers were defined using geological sections from sgm 2002 and data from aranda gómez and pérez venzor 1989 and conagua 2018a extraction volumes of 12 wells located within the study area were obtained from the mexican public registry of water rights database repda which is operated by conagua conagua 2018d the initial hydraulic conductivity for the main aquifer unconsolidated sediments was calculated based on 25 soil samples analyzed with a permeameter after calibration the resulting values range from 0 26 to 24 5 m d in layer 2 fractured intrusive and metamorphic rocks conductivity was defined at 0 001 m d theoretical values of specific storage and specific yield were obtained from morris and johnson 1967 and domenico and miflin 1965 and applied to layer 1 and 2 according to rock type table 1 the average annual recharge of the aquifer of todos santos is 18 4 106 m3 for an area of approximately 200 km2 conagua 2018a after recalculation for the study area and calibration a volume of 4 45 106 m3 was introduced to modflow using the recharge package the infiltration through the riverbeds arroyos was simulated using the streamflow package prudic et al 2004 a mean annual runoff volume of 1 72 106 m3 was obtained as result from a mean annual rainfall value of 239 mm year calculated after datasets from weather stations todos santos and santa ines and a runoff coefficient of 10 inegi 2019 a portion of 60 was introduced into the wet hurricane season during a time step 60 days while the remaining 40 was introduced for the rest of the year 300 days to model the evolution of seawater intrusion in the poza todos santos lagoon we applied the swi2 package which uses the result of the hydraulic modeling to interpret the position of the saline wedge to carry out this process we introduced a dimensionless density of 0 for freshwater zone 1 and 0 025 for saltwater zone 2 the coastline was modeled as a fixed level 0 constant in all simulation periods the initial z surface was modeled using the ghyben herzberg equation and the 2017 water levels obtained from conagua 2018b hydraulic conductivity values and fixed heads were adjusted by zones to achieve a concordance between the observed and simulated hydraulic head levels for the period 2010 2017 twelve wells and 41 randomly chosen points were selected for the calibration process the mean variation resulted in 1 01 m and an r2 of 0 9977 which represents a valid model according to wels et al 2002 and hill 1998 fig 3 the sensitivity of the model was assessed in this study varying five model parameters one at a time this analysis was applied to determine the nature of model parameter contribution to the mean evolution of water levels for the period 2017 2040 under current hydrogeological conditions after calibration and sensitivity analysis tree scenarios were simulated for the years 2017 and 2040 the cur17 and cur40 scenario simulated water levels under current climatic and sea level conditions for 2017 and 2040 respectively a conservative scenario con40 represents a reduction of 10 of rainfall 10 increase of runoffs and an increase of 2 6 of evapotranspiration finally the extreme scenario ext40 represents a reduction of 37 of rainfall an increase of evapotranspiration of 7 6 and an augment of 20 of runoffs the sea level rise was defined at 0 83 m and 1 0 m for con40 and ext40 scenarios after the prognostic run water budgets annual august september october july were calculated for the aquifer and for ptsl using the cur17 scenario as a baseline to compare with the other scenarios additionally and based on the results of this investigation we calculated the environmental flow needed to recover the oasis 2 4 the climate change recharge pressure index ccrp this novel index is proposed as a tool to define areas where recharge patterns will be affected due to climate change in the context of oases deterioration this index is useful to prioritize the location of adaptation measures it is calculated following a raster or vectorial approach and it is based on hydrogeological and physiographical indicators scaled in a 0 to 1 range we initially considered hydraulic conductivity mean annual recharge specific yield mean annual rainfall mean slope elevation distance from the coast hydrogeological units geomorphological units and mean annual runoff as preliminary indicators based on past investigations walraevens et al 2009 wurl and imaz lamadrid 2018 imaz lamadrid et al 2019 monteiro da costa et al 2019 rukundo and dogan 2019 trasviña carrillo et al 2019 seven indicators with high correlation r 0 70 and multicollinearity as tolerance 1 r2 0 30 were filtered out the resulting three indicators hydrogeological units mean annual rainfall and mean slope were analyzed using the analytic hierarchy process method saaty 1980 to define the weights for each one table 2 the equation for the calculation of ccrp is 2 ccrp hgu 0 4 mar 0 4 slp 0 2 where mar 1 mean annual rainfall min max scaled 0 1 for each cell or environmental unit eu slp 1 mean slope min max scaled 0 1 for each cell or environmental unit eu hgu hydrogeological units min max scaled 0 1 for each cell or environmental unit eu according to the next scores porous very high permeability aquifer 6 porous high permeability aquifer 5 porous moderate permeability aquifer 4 porous low permeability aquifer 3 fractured moderate permeability aquifer 2 fracture low permeability aquifer 1 the ccrp index has a range of values between 0 and 1 where 1 means very high pressure and 0 means very low pressure table 3 following the vectorial approach we defined 29 environmental units this definition was performed considering as first criteria watersheds for each arroyo in the study area then geomorphological units and finally land use then we determined values for each indicator and calculated the ccrp index for each environmental unit 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis the analysis indicate that an increment in the depth to the basement and recharge contribute to an increase of mean heads meanwhile an increase in hydraulic conductivity specific yield and pumping rate result in a decrease of mean heads fig 4 the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield are the less sensitive parameters of the model with changes in a range of 63 to 43 and 65 to 7 respectively while the most sensitive parameter is recharge with changes of 147 to 578 the depth to basement and pumping rate have changes in a range of 83 to 626 and 526 to 79 respectively 3 2 water budget and climate change effects for todos santos oasis and poza todos santos lagoon todos santos oasis model shows a mean reduction of water levels of 2 2 m for the act40 scenario this rate increase to 2 3 and 3 6 m for the con40 and ext40 scenarios respectively higher reductions are observed close to agriculture lands located in the middle and northern portion of the oasis regarding the water budget for the cur40 scenario the annual water balance indicates a deficit of 0 70 106 m3 with a positive balance of 2 29 106 m3 during august september and a deficit in october july of 2 99 106 m3 the annual deficit for the con40 and ext40 scenarios increases to 1 50 106 m3 and 2 43 106 m3 respectively because of a reduction of freshwater input during the wet season table 4 in the case of poza todos santos lagoon for the cur17 40 scenario during october july the inflow of seawater is higher than the inflow of freshwater while outflows are superior to overall inflows therefore the balance is negative on august september the relation saltwater freshwater is reversed and the balance is positive annually water balance is 11 2 103 m3 under the con40 scenario results indicate an increase of inflows related to spring surface flows and seawater intrusion resulting in an annual water balance of 34 1 103 m3 for this scenario the total inflows of freshwater are 3 0 103 m3 higher than the total inflows of seawater finally the ext40 scenario annual water balance reaches 47 0 103 m3 as a result of an increment of inflows of freshwater and seawater in this case the inflow of seawater overpasses the inflows of freshwater by 8 5 103 m3 table 5 according to the swi2 model in all three scenarios the seawater wedge will move inland the maximum displacement along the coast is predicted from 8 to 254 m while in poza todos santos lagoon the migration will be from 40 to 178 m an inflow of seawater into the lagoon is expected in a range of 35 6 71 2 103 m3 year for act40 and ext40 scenarios respectively the volume of the seawater wedge for the act17 is 1 3 106 m3 this volume increases to 1 4 106 m3 for the act40 considering climate change the volumes increase to 2 49 106 m3 and 2 78 106 m3 for the con40 and ext40 scenarios respectively 3 3 evolution of land use and salinity analysis with satellite imagery shows that the extension of the oasis decreased 51 2 in 17 years as well as the flooding area of ptsl and the natural landscape with 63 0 and 21 7 respectively on the other side agriculture land use had the highest increment with 86 59 followed by urban land use with 43 57 according to these results for the year 2040 agriculture and urban land use will continue growing while the oasis and natural land uses will continue decreasing table 6 in the case of poza todos santos lagoon although the trend is towards a reduction sea level rise will increase the inflow of saltwater maintaining or even increasing the extension the salinity data obtained from conagua 2018c shows for 2015 a mean of 868 6 μs cm with a standard deviation of 619 5 μs cm for this year the range of salinity varies from 505 to 1584 μs cm for the period 2016 2017 salinity increases reaching a mean of 1256 μs cm with a standard deviation of 1307 μs cm and a maximum of 2773 μs cm in 2018 salinity decreases to a mean of 953 6 μs cm with a standard deviation of 798 μs cm with a maximum of 1873 μs cm in the lagoon the survey campaign performed in 2018 shows a strong variation of salinity ranging from 5700 μs cm december to 50 613 μs cm june the average salinity for this year was 24 989 μs cm with a standard deviation of 20 459 μs cm 3 4 ccrp index zoning after the application of ccrp the mean score for the whole area is 0 592 with a maximum of 0 980 and a minimum of 0 084 and a standard deviation of 0 240 eight environmental units with very low and low pressure represent 9 and 40 of the study area respectively three environmental units with moderate pressure represent 9 of the study area finally high pressure and very high pressure occur in 17 environmental units representing 28 and 14 of the study area respectively the current extensions of the todos santos oasis and ptsl have very high and high pressure fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 impact of water exploitation in todos santos oasis one of the main problems the oasis is facing is unsustainable management todos santos aquifer as delineated by conagua 2018a involves three watersheds and at least three aquifers which in some areas are not interconnected due to the outcrop of the basement as mapped by aranda gomez y perez venzor 1989 and sgm 2001 the todos santos aquifer is officially defined as underexploited conagua 2018a however and according to our results the todos santos oasis aquifer is overexploited facing the reduction of water levels and increments of salinity near the coast in this context the location of wells morphology of the watershed changes in recharge patterns and the depth to the basement are key factors to understand the hydrological impacts on the oasis on the northern side the aquifer has a cone shape with 480 m width and an estimated depth to the basement of less than 60 m the highest pumping rates in the watershed according to conagua 2018d are located in this area generating a strong reduction of groundwater inflow from the northern aquifer to the southern aquifer most of this water is extracted for agriculture and urban use the reduction of water levels and the use of freshwater modify the stage of surface water levels affecting the water availability for the oasis and the lagoon springs used to flow continuously during the year however since 2007 the flow is limited during most of the year except for short periods after the approach of tropical cyclones or torrential rains salinity values analyzed in this study and results from other works mahlknecht et al 2018 conagua 2018c confirm increased salinity near the coastline to restore the environmental flow of the oasis it is necessary to increase the inflow to the system by 1 26 106 m3 our results suggest that todos santos oasis undergoes a deterioration process 4 2 climate change and coastal development pressures to todos santos oasis as demonstrated by the groundwater model recharge is one of the most sensitive factors in the hydrogeological model of the aquifer considering the climate change predictions reviewed kirtman et al 2013 imta 2015 romero vadillo and romero vadillo 2012 ojeda bustamante 2011 mundo molina 2015 it can be expected that recharge values will be modified recharge sources horizontal groundwater flow spring flows and direct rainfall in the period from october to july will be affected by a reduction of rainfall according to the model and weather predictions of kirtman et al 2013 and imta 2015 from august to september direct rainfall and stream flows will increase as a result of higher frequency and intensification of tropical cyclones forecasted by kirtman et al 2013 and romero vadillo and romero vadillo 2012 this increment will not necessarily improve the infiltration as stream sediments quickly become saturated especially those with moderate to low permeability this situation has been observed in other aquifers of baja california sur state wurl et al 2018 model results show that recharge in river beds will be stable in a range of 0 27 to 0 31 106 m3 overall the forecasted reduction of recharge from october to july will impact the balance of the aquifer favoring the deterioration of the oasis the results obtained from the ccrp index indicate that the oasis area will suffer very high pressure in its recharge patterns environmental units 1 6 13 17 followed by the northern aquifer area and several zones around the oasis environmental units 2 4 9 10 14 15 20 25 27 in this context 42 of the study area will be highly impacted by the forecasted pressure to recharge at the coastline the forecasted sea level rise vermeer and rahmstorf 2009 church et al 2013 will generate modifications to the morphology of the coast and provoke an increment of seawater inflow to the aquifer and poza todos santos lagoon nowadays the inflow of seawater into the lagoon is mostly through a groundwater inflow with some minor flow at the surface during high tides according to our results and for the near future sea level rise will increase the inflow of saltwater into the lagoon 5 conclusions oases are valuable ecosystems that play an important role in providing ecological services to populations and serve as a refuge of fauna species water in these ecosystems is a vitally important input for the development of flora and fauna especially in arid zones where freshwater resources are limited coastal development inadequate management and climate change are key factors to understand the deterioration of oases in arid zones for these reasons is highly important to characterize the threats that add pressure to the system and to promote strategies for their conservation the multicriteria methodology we presented in this research allowed us not only to recognize the main factors affecting an oasis but to forecast the level of degradation the application of ccrp index provided useful geospatial information to prioritize those areas where adaptation measures may be applied our results indicate that it is necessary to reduce the volume of extractions north of the study area and to avoid the use of surface water from the arroyo and the oasis additionally our methodology can be used as input for feasibility studies for the installation of recharge dams these actions will contribute to increase the inflow of freshwater into the oasis and to the restoration of this ecosystem declaration of competing

surface water from la reforma creek 2 1 1 geological and hydrogeological setting from a geologic perspective todos santos oasis is located on the western portion of the la paz plutonic complex lpcc the lpcc is mainly composed of plutonic intrusive and metamorphic rocks ranging from late jurassic to cretaceous aranda gómez y pérez venzor 1989 on the eastern side of the lpcc there is a system of horst and grabens related to the gulf of california extensional province these tectonic basins are filled with terrigenous and marine rocks from the late miocene to recent holocene sediments aranda gómez y pérez venzor 1989 sgm 2001 in the todos santos area two main geological units are observed the oldest unit is the todos santos crystalline complex tscc with an estimated age of late jurassic cretaceous it is composed of gneiss mylonites and phyllites with minor outcrops of tonalities these rocks outcrop in the hills around todos santos oasis and near the coast aranda gómez y pérez venzor 1989 sgm 2001 mahlknecht et al 2018 erosion of the mountain range and surrounding hills filled the todos santos valley with alluvial sediments composed by sedimentary rocks sandstones limestones conglomerates with ages from pliocene pleistocene and sediments from the holocene aranda gomez y perez venzor 1989 sgm 2001 mahlknecht et al 2018 two main types of aquifers can be distinguished in the area fractured aquifers of limited permeability corresponding to tscc rocks and porous aquifers with low to moderate permeability conformed of alluvial and coastal sediments according to conagua 2018a the porous units of the todos santos aquifer are considered the main aquifer which is characterized as unconfined with transmissivity values ranging from 2 6 to 84 8 103 m2 s the depth to basement is in a range of 10 60 m according to conagua 2018a meanwhile mahlknecht et al 2018 define a maximum thickness of 100 m the aquifer mean annual recharge is 18 4 106 m3 and the mean annual availability of water is 0 08 106 m3 which indicates that officially the aquifer is not overexploited conagua 2018a however water levels have dropped an annual average of 0 92 m with a standard deviation of 0 5 m for the period 2010 2017 mahlknecht et al 2018 identified three main hydrochemical groups of groundwater the first group with electrical conductivity ec values of 433 31 μs cm is located in the recharge areas north of todos santos group 2 representing more mineralized waters with ec values of 1049 231 μs cm are related to transitory groundwater flow through alluvial deposits finally the third group rich in na cl and ec values ranging from 16 900 to 32 100 μs cm are mostly located near the coastline and poza todos santos 2 1 2 climate change scenarios for the study area global and regional circulation models and climate change studies predict changes in rainfall patterns for the region kirtman et al 2013 proposed reductions of no cyclonic rains of up to 10 for a representative concentration pathway rcp of 4 5 while imta 2015 forecasted changes of up to 37 for the scenario rcp 6 0 intensification of summer rains and runoffs of up to 10 are predicted kirtman et al 2013 romero vadillo and romero vadillo 2012 due to global warming ojeda bustamante et al 2011 proposed for northwest mexico an increment of evapotranspiration of 10 a1b for the year 2100 while mundo molina 2015 defined an increment of 2 7 a1b for the year 2050 according to a detailed compilation presented by church et al 2013 sea level will rise in a range of 0 16 1 6 m for the year 2100 under different rcp scenarios however vermeer and rahmstorf 2009 forecasted a maximum rise of 1 9 m a2 for the same year predictions considering climate change and storm surges in the united states forecast a sea level rise up to 4 6 m for 2050 melillo et al 2014 2 2 evolution of land use and salinity of todos santos oasis to estimate the evolution of land use in the oasis and extension of the poza todos santos lagoon a spatial analysis was performed using satellite imagery landsat 8 and digital globe images with a resolution of 10 m for years 2002 and 2018 were uploaded in qgis 3 0 permitting to estimate the coverage of urban areas planted parcels natural landscapes and the extension of the lagoon the rate of change within time steps of 10 years was calculated and then forecasted to the year 2040 the behavior of salinity in the aquifer was assessed considering data obtained from conagua 2018c for the period 2015 2018 salinity in the lagoon was characterized by performing on site measurements using a hanna calibrated equipment and a refractometer 2 3 groundwater model due to the importance of groundwater in the water budget of the oasis a modflow model was built to understand the depletion of water levels the behavior of seawater intrusion to the lagoon and to calculate the ecological flow the model was constructed with model muse winston 2009 developed by the united states geological survey usgs for the modflow 2005 algorithm harbaugh et al 2000 this program simulates steady and transient flows in confined or unconfined aquifers or a combination of them the governing equation used by modflow 2005 is 1 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z w s s h t where h denotes the potentiometric head m k denotes the hydraulic conductivity m d ss denotes the specific storage of the porous material m 1 w denotes the volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources and or sinks of water m3 d the model was calibrated for the period 2010 2017 dividing each year into three periods representing the average behavior of rainfall in the area dry season 180 days and wet season 60 days of cyclonic rains 125 days of non cyclonic rains 2 3 1 conceptual mathematical model design the groundwater model domain included three natural boundaries the coastline of the pacific ocean simulated as general head conditions fractured aquitards of the surrounding hills defined as a no flow condition to simulate the underground inflow from the northern aquifers a recharge zone was defined in the northeastern boundary of the model fig 2 using a finite difference approach the mesh consisted of two layers with cell sizes of 25 25m near the coastline and 50 50 m in the rest of the model area with an extension of 28 km2 the starting heads of the model were defined for the year 2010 based on the water levels provided by conagua 2018b the top of the aquifer was obtained from the 30 m digital elevation model aster gdem re sampled to 25 m the granitic basement and the thickness of the layers were defined using geological sections from sgm 2002 and data from aranda gómez and pérez venzor 1989 and conagua 2018a extraction volumes of 12 wells located within the study area were obtained from the mexican public registry of water rights database repda which is operated by conagua conagua 2018d the initial hydraulic conductivity for the main aquifer unconsolidated sediments was calculated based on 25 soil samples analyzed with a permeameter after calibration the resulting values range from 0 26 to 24 5 m d in layer 2 fractured intrusive and metamorphic rocks conductivity was defined at 0 001 m d theoretical values of specific storage and specific yield were obtained from morris and johnson 1967 and domenico and miflin 1965 and applied to layer 1 and 2 according to rock type table 1 the average annual recharge of the aquifer of todos santos is 18 4 106 m3 for an area of approximately 200 km2 conagua 2018a after recalculation for the study area and calibration a volume of 4 45 106 m3 was introduced to modflow using the recharge package the infiltration through the riverbeds arroyos was simulated using the streamflow package prudic et al 2004 a mean annual runoff volume of 1 72 106 m3 was obtained as result from a mean annual rainfall value of 239 mm year calculated after datasets from weather stations todos santos and santa ines and a runoff coefficient of 10 inegi 2019 a portion of 60 was introduced into the wet hurricane season during a time step 60 days while the remaining 40 was introduced for the rest of the year 300 days to model the evolution of seawater intrusion in the poza todos santos lagoon we applied the swi2 package which uses the result of the hydraulic modeling to interpret the position of the saline wedge to carry out this process we introduced a dimensionless density of 0 for freshwater zone 1 and 0 025 for saltwater zone 2 the coastline was modeled as a fixed level 0 constant in all simulation periods the initial z surface was modeled using the ghyben herzberg equation and the 2017 water levels obtained from conagua 2018b hydraulic conductivity values and fixed heads were adjusted by zones to achieve a concordance between the observed and simulated hydraulic head levels for the period 2010 2017 twelve wells and 41 randomly chosen points were selected for the calibration process the mean variation resulted in 1 01 m and an r2 of 0 9977 which represents a valid model according to wels et al 2002 and hill 1998 fig 3 the sensitivity of the model was assessed in this study varying five model parameters one at a time this analysis was applied to determine the nature of model parameter contribution to the mean evolution of water levels for the period 2017 2040 under current hydrogeological conditions after calibration and sensitivity analysis tree scenarios were simulated for the years 2017 and 2040 the cur17 and cur40 scenario simulated water levels under current climatic and sea level conditions for 2017 and 2040 respectively a conservative scenario con40 represents a reduction of 10 of rainfall 10 increase of runoffs and an increase of 2 6 of evapotranspiration finally the extreme scenario ext40 represents a reduction of 37 of rainfall an increase of evapotranspiration of 7 6 and an augment of 20 of runoffs the sea level rise was defined at 0 83 m and 1 0 m for con40 and ext40 scenarios after the prognostic run water budgets annual august september october july were calculated for the aquifer and for ptsl using the cur17 scenario as a baseline to compare with the other scenarios additionally and based on the results of this investigation we calculated the environmental flow needed to recover the oasis 2 4 the climate change recharge pressure index ccrp this novel index is proposed as a tool to define areas where recharge patterns will be affected due to climate change in the context of oases deterioration this index is useful to prioritize the location of adaptation measures it is calculated following a raster or vectorial approach and it is based on hydrogeological and physiographical indicators scaled in a 0 to 1 range we initially considered hydraulic conductivity mean annual recharge specific yield mean annual rainfall mean slope elevation distance from the coast hydrogeological units geomorphological units and mean annual runoff as preliminary indicators based on past investigations walraevens et al 2009 wurl and imaz lamadrid 2018 imaz lamadrid et al 2019 monteiro da costa et al 2019 rukundo and dogan 2019 trasviña carrillo et al 2019 seven indicators with high correlation r 0 70 and multicollinearity as tolerance 1 r2 0 30 were filtered out the resulting three indicators hydrogeological units mean annual rainfall and mean slope were analyzed using the analytic hierarchy process method saaty 1980 to define the weights for each one table 2 the equation for the calculation of ccrp is 2 ccrp hgu 0 4 mar 0 4 slp 0 2 where mar 1 mean annual rainfall min max scaled 0 1 for each cell or environmental unit eu slp 1 mean slope min max scaled 0 1 for each cell or environmental unit eu hgu hydrogeological units min max scaled 0 1 for each cell or environmental unit eu according to the next scores porous very high permeability aquifer 6 porous high permeability aquifer 5 porous moderate permeability aquifer 4 porous low permeability aquifer 3 fractured moderate permeability aquifer 2 fracture low permeability aquifer 1 the ccrp index has a range of values between 0 and 1 where 1 means very high pressure and 0 means very low pressure table 3 following the vectorial approach we defined 29 environmental units this definition was performed considering as first criteria watersheds for each arroyo in the study area then geomorphological units and finally land use then we determined values for each indicator and calculated the ccrp index for each environmental unit 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis the analysis indicate that an increment in the depth to the basement and recharge contribute to an increase of mean heads meanwhile an increase in hydraulic conductivity specific yield and pumping rate result in a decrease of mean heads fig 4 the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield are the less sensitive parameters of the model with changes in a range of 63 to 43 and 65 to 7 respectively while the most sensitive parameter is recharge with changes of 147 to 578 the depth to basement and pumping rate have changes in a range of 83 to 626 and 526 to 79 respectively 3 2 water budget and climate change effects for todos santos oasis and poza todos santos lagoon todos santos oasis model shows a mean reduction of water levels of 2 2 m for the act40 scenario this rate increase to 2 3 and 3 6 m for the con40 and ext40 scenarios respectively higher reductions are observed close to agriculture lands located in the middle and northern portion of the oasis regarding the water budget for the cur40 scenario the annual water balance indicates a deficit of 0 70 106 m3 with a positive balance of 2 29 106 m3 during august september and a deficit in october july of 2 99 106 m3 the annual deficit for the con40 and ext40 scenarios increases to 1 50 106 m3 and 2 43 106 m3 respectively because of a reduction of freshwater input during the wet season table 4 in the case of poza todos santos lagoon for the cur17 40 scenario during october july the inflow of seawater is higher than the inflow of freshwater while outflows are superior to overall inflows therefore the balance is negative on august september the relation saltwater freshwater is reversed and the balance is positive annually water balance is 11 2 103 m3 under the con40 scenario results indicate an increase of inflows related to spring surface flows and seawater intrusion resulting in an annual water balance of 34 1 103 m3 for this scenario the total inflows of freshwater are 3 0 103 m3 higher than the total inflows of seawater finally the ext40 scenario annual water balance reaches 47 0 103 m3 as a result of an increment of inflows of freshwater and seawater in this case the inflow of seawater overpasses the inflows of freshwater by 8 5 103 m3 table 5 according to the swi2 model in all three scenarios the seawater wedge will move inland the maximum displacement along the coast is predicted from 8 to 254 m while in poza todos santos lagoon the migration will be from 40 to 178 m an inflow of seawater into the lagoon is expected in a range of 35 6 71 2 103 m3 year for act40 and ext40 scenarios respectively the volume of the seawater wedge for the act17 is 1 3 106 m3 this volume increases to 1 4 106 m3 for the act40 considering climate change the volumes increase to 2 49 106 m3 and 2 78 106 m3 for the con40 and ext40 scenarios respectively 3 3 evolution of land use and salinity analysis with satellite imagery shows that the extension of the oasis decreased 51 2 in 17 years as well as the flooding area of ptsl and the natural landscape with 63 0 and 21 7 respectively on the other side agriculture land use had the highest increment with 86 59 followed by urban land use with 43 57 according to these results for the year 2040 agriculture and urban land use will continue growing while the oasis and natural land uses will continue decreasing table 6 in the case of poza todos santos lagoon although the trend is towards a reduction sea level rise will increase the inflow of saltwater maintaining or even increasing the extension the salinity data obtained from conagua 2018c shows for 2015 a mean of 868 6 μs cm with a standard deviation of 619 5 μs cm for this year the range of salinity varies from 505 to 1584 μs cm for the period 2016 2017 salinity increases reaching a mean of 1256 μs cm with a standard deviation of 1307 μs cm and a maximum of 2773 μs cm in 2018 salinity decreases to a mean of 953 6 μs cm with a standard deviation of 798 μs cm with a maximum of 1873 μs cm in the lagoon the survey campaign performed in 2018 shows a strong variation of salinity ranging from 5700 μs cm december to 50 613 μs cm june the average salinity for this year was 24 989 μs cm with a standard deviation of 20 459 μs cm 3 4 ccrp index zoning after the application of ccrp the mean score for the whole area is 0 592 with a maximum of 0 980 and a minimum of 0 084 and a standard deviation of 0 240 eight environmental units with very low and low pressure represent 9 and 40 of the study area respectively three environmental units with moderate pressure represent 9 of the study area finally high pressure and very high pressure occur in 17 environmental units representing 28 and 14 of the study area respectively the current extensions of the todos santos oasis and ptsl have very high and high pressure fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 impact of water exploitation in todos santos oasis one of the main problems the oasis is facing is unsustainable management todos santos aquifer as delineated by conagua 2018a involves three watersheds and at least three aquifers which in some areas are not interconnected due to the outcrop of the basement as mapped by aranda gomez y perez venzor 1989 and sgm 2001 the todos santos aquifer is officially defined as underexploited conagua 2018a however and according to our results the todos santos oasis aquifer is overexploited facing the reduction of water levels and increments of salinity near the coast in this context the location of wells morphology of the watershed changes in recharge patterns and the depth to the basement are key factors to understand the hydrological impacts on the oasis on the northern side the aquifer has a cone shape with 480 m width and an estimated depth to the basement of less than 60 m the highest pumping rates in the watershed according to conagua 2018d are located in this area generating a strong reduction of groundwater inflow from the northern aquifer to the southern aquifer most of this water is extracted for agriculture and urban use the reduction of water levels and the use of freshwater modify the stage of surface water levels affecting the water availability for the oasis and the lagoon springs used to flow continuously during the year however since 2007 the flow is limited during most of the year except for short periods after the approach of tropical cyclones or torrential rains salinity values analyzed in this study and results from other works mahlknecht et al 2018 conagua 2018c confirm increased salinity near the coastline to restore the environmental flow of the oasis it is necessary to increase the inflow to the system by 1 26 106 m3 our results suggest that todos santos oasis undergoes a deterioration process 4 2 climate change and coastal development pressures to todos santos oasis as demonstrated by the groundwater model recharge is one of the most sensitive factors in the hydrogeological model of the aquifer considering the climate change predictions reviewed kirtman et al 2013 imta 2015 romero vadillo and romero vadillo 2012 ojeda bustamante 2011 mundo molina 2015 it can be expected that recharge values will be modified recharge sources horizontal groundwater flow spring flows and direct rainfall in the period from october to july will be affected by a reduction of rainfall according to the model and weather predictions of kirtman et al 2013 and imta 2015 from august to september direct rainfall and stream flows will increase as a result of higher frequency and intensification of tropical cyclones forecasted by kirtman et al 2013 and romero vadillo and romero vadillo 2012 this increment will not necessarily improve the infiltration as stream sediments quickly become saturated especially those with moderate to low permeability this situation has been observed in other aquifers of baja california sur state wurl et al 2018 model results show that recharge in river beds will be stable in a range of 0 27 to 0 31 106 m3 overall the forecasted reduction of recharge from october to july will impact the balance of the aquifer favoring the deterioration of the oasis the results obtained from the ccrp index indicate that the oasis area will suffer very high pressure in its recharge patterns environmental units 1 6 13 17 followed by the northern aquifer area and several zones around the oasis environmental units 2 4 9 10 14 15 20 25 27 in this context 42 of the study area will be highly impacted by the forecasted pressure to recharge at the coastline the forecasted sea level rise vermeer and rahmstorf 2009 church et al 2013 will generate modifications to the morphology of the coast and provoke an increment of seawater inflow to the aquifer and poza todos santos lagoon nowadays the inflow of seawater into the lagoon is mostly through a groundwater inflow with some minor flow at the surface during high tides according to our results and for the near future sea level rise will increase the inflow of saltwater into the lagoon 5 conclusions oases are valuable ecosystems that play an important role in providing ecological services to populations and serve as a refuge of fauna species water in these ecosystems is a vitally important input for the development of flora and fauna especially in arid zones where freshwater resources are limited coastal development inadequate management and climate change are key factors to understand the deterioration of oases in arid zones for these reasons is highly important to characterize the threats that add pressure to the system and to promote strategies for their conservation the multicriteria methodology we presented in this research allowed us not only to recognize the main factors affecting an oasis but to forecast the level of degradation the application of ccrp index provided useful geospatial information to prioritize those areas where adaptation measures may be applied our results indicate that it is necessary to reduce the volume of extractions north of the study area and to avoid the use of surface water from the arroyo and the oasis additionally our methodology can be used as input for feasibility studies for the installation of recharge dams these actions will contribute to increase the inflow of freshwater into the oasis and to the restoration of this ecosystem declaration of competing

12051,the present study has been carried out to determine the sources and distribution of fluoride f contamination in the water of district bijapur chhattisgarh central india for this study 45 water samples were collected from surface and groundwater from shallow and deeper aquifers it was observed that 50 of groundwater samples have elevated f level and varies from 0 1 to 7 1 mg l though f level in water bodies was below the who maximum permissible limit 1 5 mg l the major ions of water samples reveal the dominance of ca mg hco3 hydrochemical facies this study suggests f contaminated water shows a significant correlation with cl which further supported by statistical correlation analysis of rocks and sediments from the study area suggests leaching of minerals like biotite hornblende and richterite which are likely sources for elevated f level in groundwater gibbs diagram reveals the dominance of the evaporative process for contaminated water by f in the study area due to improper

discovered at regular intervals this study was conducted in the unexplored district of bijapur a tribal dominated area which lies in chhattisgarh state in central india and investigated the extent and genesis of fluoride in surface and groundwater this study suggests 50 contamination of groundwater with fluoride while safe zones within contaminated aquifers also exist in the area 2 study area bijapur is one of the 18 districts of chhattisgarh state located in central india between lat 18 45 18 75 n and long 80 41 80 68 e fig 1 the study area is bounded by telangana from the south

soil samples were also collected for f content fig 2 the lat long of sampling sites were measured using garmin global positioning system gpsmap 76s the worldwide apha 2005 technique was adopted for the analysis of water samples two sets of water samples from each location were collected as i unacidified samples for analyses of major anions and fluoride filtered with 0 45 μm cellulose nitrate ii acidified samples with ultrapure hno3 l to keep ph 2 to avoid precipitation for the analyses of major cations filtered with 0 45 μm cellulose nitrate the polythene bottles have been used for samples collection after being cleaned overnight with 2n hcl and washed with milli q water the sample collection tube wells were pumped for at least 10 min to flush out the stagnant water inside the wells and sample bottles were washed multiple times with the representative sample to avoid any pre contamination the sample bottles were completely filled with water to be collected and shaken well in order to remove all the trapped air bubbles if any to restrict oxidation to avoid any leakage and cross contamination all the sample bottles were tightly sealed and caps were covered with teflon tape and stored at low temperature 4 c for further laboratory analyses 3 1 field analysis during the sampling crucial physical parameters such as ph were measured by portable ph meter orion 261s with a

software package and phreeqc thermodynamic database in aquachem it is calculated as s i l o g i a p k e q where iap is the product of the effective concentration of the dissolved species and k eq is the equilibrium constant in a system positive si value suggests mineral is supersaturated and may precipitate and negative saturation index indicates under saturation the mineral phase shows thermodynamic equilibrium with the solution if the saturation index is equal to zero however fluids with saturation indices 0 2 si 0 2 are also considered as saturated solution langmuri and melchior

contamination above the maximum permissible limits however in groundwater around 50 of samples 17 samples out of 33 groundwater samples show f level higher than the prescribed limit the f level in groundwater samples ranged from 0 1 to 7 1 mg l and the highest concentration of 7 1 mg l was observed from the borguda area fig 2 f level in surface waters is lower than the maximum permissible limit and ranging from 0 06 to 1 2 mg l 4 2 water type the major ions plotted on the piper tri linear diagram piper 1944 revealing water samples predominately belong to ca mg hco3 facies type fig 4 this water facies indicates that both waters had undergone a similar kind of rock water interaction except at a deeper level groundwater samples interaction is more intense the rocks associated in the study area are rich in alkaline elements such as na k and mg the piper tri linear diagram suggest the contaminated groundwater shows shifting towards na and k zone while surface water falling toward ca2 and mg2 zone this indicates the release of f into the contaminated water due to the ions exchange process with the minerals however other parameters should also be considered for deciphering the clear picture the bivariate graphs are further used to evaluate the specific view of mineral weathering in water in this regard gibbs diagram is plotted to identify the major geochemical process predominating in the area fig 5 it was observed that most of the samples are falling within the water rock interaction zone thus it indicates that the weathering of minerals is the major mechanism responsible for controlling the hydrogeochemistry of water it was also found that the contaminated water with f shows a deviation towards the evaporative zone fig 5 the high temperature with significant fall of the water table during pre monsoon season is a major factor responsible for such deviation in general the groundwater gets enriched in ions during the water rock interaction from the rocks soils or sediments therefore na normalized molar ratios ca na hco3 na and mg na ratios have been calculated to examine the main lithology responsible for controlling the hydrogeochemistry luo et al 2018 fig 6 it was observed from fig 6 that the water samples from the bijapur area falls in the carbonate silicate weathering line and carbonate silicate zone thus it suggests that both carbonate and silicate dissolution plays a vital role in the groundwater chemistry while contaminated water with f falls towards silicate weathering zone 4 3 fluoride content in rocks and soil the rocks and soil samples were also collected from bijapur for determining the f concentration thus for this purpose samples were collected from the sporadic outcrop of gneiss grt bt sil and grt sil rt bearing limestone terrains ramachandra et al 2001 analysis of these samples shows a wide variation of f concentration and ranges from 300 to 652 mg kg in rocks and 188 906 mg kg in soil table 3 the bulk analysis of rocks and soil decipher the mobilization of the f in the study area the weathered and unweathered gneiss rock samples were collected from the study area for the f content for reveling the mobilization of f the analysis of both gneiss samples shows distinct variation having 652 mg kg of f in unweathered and 300 mg kg in weathered gneiss this suggests leaching of f during weathering into water and soil samples whereas the soil samples collected from the region show much variations in the f concentration and ranged from 188 to 906 mg kg the high value in soil indicates f derived from weathering of the gneiss 4 4 bulk chemistry f bearing minerals have also been observed in xrd of selected rock and soil samples fig 7 intense peaks of biotite in gneiss and richterite in soil samples have been detected fig 7a and d however these minerals could not be detected in weathered gneiss and limestone fig 7b and c this indicates the leaching of f bearing minerals during the weathering processes the leached f may ultimately end up adding to the groundwater and increase the f concentration the evaporation evapotranspiration of contaminated water used for irrigation results in precipitation of the salts on topsoils however it is suggested that during the rainy season the salt gets dissolved and percolates down with the rainwater and thus contaminates the groundwater the low content of k ion except in sample i e 31 in contaminated groundwater rule out the anthropogenic influences where the value reached more than 50 mg l table 1 4 5 statistical correlation statistical analysis was performed to identify the relationship between the hydrochemical parameters of the contaminated water table 4 it was observed that groundwater with high f is associated with high hco3 further f also shows a significant correlation with na and cl table 4 in contaminated groundwater samples f shows significant correlation r 0 8 with na k cl ec and hco3 earlier studies also established a good relationship of f with hco3 rao et al 1993 handa 1975 jacks et al 1993 kundu et al 2001 ali et al 2016 4 6 fluoride vs ph and major ions the relationship between f and ph as well as major ions can explain the various geochemical processes responsible for groundwater chemistry as shown in fig 8 a and table 1 more than 80 of water samples showing the ph level more than 7 hence slightly alkaline in nature and this alkaline environmental conditions may responsible for f leaching via desorption or ion substitution luo et al 2018 the high concentration of hco3 is common in the high f contaminated water luo et al 2018 the correlation between the f and hco3 is found positive in contaminated water fig 8b thus it indicates that the dissolution of carbonate rocks and the ions exchange process is responsible for f mobilization sujatha and reddy 2003 ali et al 2018 dissolution of silicate minerals may leach the cl add to the aquifers and play role in the ions exchange process whereas no significant correlation between the f and so4 was observed it may be due to the low recharge through the lithologies present in the study area fig 8c the positive correlation between the f and cl observed in the contaminated water samples fig 8d the groundwater samples with high f concentration indicating a good correlation with na and k whereas no correlation with ca2 and mg2 fig 8e f g and h this may happen due to the long residence time of groundwater associated with the carbonate silicate lithology clays and fluorine bearing minerals fig 6 during the acidic medium f may absorb on clays minerals and in the alkaline medium it could be desorbed and leach the f to the aquifer saxena and ahmed 2003 thus alkaline condition ph range 6 5 8 9 mean 7 7 table 2 provides a favorable condition for f dissolution in the study area similarly in some previous studies described by eriksson 1981 and nanyaro et al 1984 also observed weak a correlation of ca2 and mg2 with f this phenomenon of low ca2 and negligible mg2 concentration corresponds to relatively high f value was also observed by maina and gaciri 1984 4 7 mineral saturation index si in f contaminated water samples si of calcite and dolomite mineral phases indicates over saturation table 5 thus may favor precipitation of these minerals with regards to f saturation index negative values indicating under saturation or a tendency of dissolution the significant positive correlation of f and gypsum saturation index has been observed fig 9 a whereas no significant relationship exists between si of f and calcite this indicates that the calcite mineral may not play a direct role in fluoride contamination of the groundwater fig 9b 5 conclusions elevated level of f in groundwater has been reported in many indian states and chhattisgarh is one of them in this study it has been found that in the unexplored tribal area of district bijapur around 50 of the groundwater samples are contaminated with f the study reveals that the weathering of f bearing minerals such as biotite hornblende and richterite are major sources responsible for contamination of groundwater in the bijawar district this is confirmed by xrd of rock and soil samples these minerals are present in fresh gneiss but absent in the weathered gneiss rock sample this indicates leaching of f from the rock during weathering gibbs diagram reveals the shifting of contaminated water by f towards the evaporative zone in addition bivariant plots suggest the dominance of both carbonate and silicate dissolution processes influencing groundwater chemistry the high ph triggering f into groundwater and the properties of solid surfaces further promote the desorption adsorption conditions may responsible for the high level of f in addition samples with high f concentration shows good correlation with na k and cl and the significant correlation between f and hco3 and high ph of contaminated water is the main factor responsible for f mobilization in spite of this the surface water in the area shows a low level of f well below the who permissible limit which indicates that the water can be used as an alternative after treated

12051,the present study has been carried out to determine the sources and distribution of fluoride f contamination in the water of district bijapur chhattisgarh central india for this study 45 water samples were collected from surface and groundwater from shallow and deeper aquifers it was observed that 50 of groundwater samples have elevated f level and varies from 0 1 to 7 1 mg l though f level in water bodies was below the who maximum permissible limit 1 5 mg l the major ions of water samples reveal the dominance of ca mg hco3 hydrochemical facies this study suggests f contaminated water shows a significant correlation with cl which further supported by statistical correlation analysis of rocks and sediments from the study area suggests leaching of minerals like biotite hornblende and richterite which are likely sources for elevated f level in groundwater gibbs diagram reveals the dominance of the evaporative process for contaminated water by f in the study area due to improper

sample bottles were washed multiple times with the representative sample to avoid any pre contamination the sample bottles were completely filled with water to be collected and shaken well in order to remove all the trapped air bubbles if any to restrict oxidation to avoid any leakage and cross contamination all the sample bottles were tightly sealed and caps were covered with teflon tape and

12052,manual drilling offers a practical and affordable method of increasing access to groundwater supply in regions struggling with economic water scarcity however manual techniques are limited to specific hydrogeological contexts and must be sited appropriately indicator kriging is proposed as an interpolation method that builds upon previous efforts to identify suitable zones for manual drilling particularly in weathered crystalline basement aquifers this approach allows for heterogeneity within weathering profiles and provides probability mapping of success for regional planning modeling was conducted in the upper east region of ghana using available borehole log data including well yield static water depth laterite thickness depth to hard rock water quality parameters and the degree of weathering indicator kriging interpolations for depth to hard rock predicted binary variables with over 90 accuracy the model predicts that drilling into highly weathered layers will often be necessary to reach the required depths for groundwater use emphasizing the importance of percussion techniques the results suggest that suitable zones occur near bolgatanga bawku and zebila which coincide with historical drilling efforts in the central and eastern portions of the region graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater development water supply crystalline rocks drilling ghana 1 introduction groundwater is an incredibly valuable resource in africa available through numerous and varied aquifers across the continent macdonald et al 2012 in the rural areas of sub saharan africa adelana and macdonald 2008 estimate that roughly 100 million people are dependent on groundwater supply groundwater can provide a reliable resilient and protected source of water for domestic and agricultural purposes lapworth et al 2017 further groundwater can contribute to human development through increased food security poverty reduction and increased health making it critical to the success of the sustainable development goals conti et al 2016 hunter et al 2009 in the right context manual drilling offers a practical and affordable method for accessing groundwater manual drilling replicates mechanical drilling methods but uses human power to dig the borehole martínez santos et al 2017 with proper construction procedures such as sanitary seals and gravel packs a well can effectively protect water quality likewise appropriate siting such as accounting for seasonal variations in water levels can ensure reliable supply manual drilling methods include augering sludging jetting and percussion with each technique more effective in specific geological contexts labas et al 2010 as of 2015 this practice was well established in bangladesh bolivia india kenya niger nigeria and madagascar was gaining traction in chad senegal and zambia and had been introduced in almost 30 other countries danert 2015 manual drilling has its share of advantages and disadvantages according to danert 2015 since lighter equipment is involved it can be moved more easily than traditional drilling rigs while still drilling faster and more safely than digging by hand it also typically costs 4 to 10 times less than machine drilled wells the enhanced affordability can help improve groundwater accessibility compared with the higher costs of mechanized drilling unfortunately manual drilling is limited to relatively shallow aquifers found in soft unconsolidated sediments or highly weathered crystalline rocks the technique is also restricted by its maximum depth with claims ranging from 25 to 50 m fussi et al 2017 gaya et al 2005 martínez santos et al 2017 thomas et al 2012 with these factors in mind table 1 summarizes the criteria that researchers have developed to identify suitable zones for manual drilling geological suitability and water depth are consistently the key factors associated with feasibility maps two recent articles brought new factors into consideration both fussi et al 2017 and martínez santos et al 2017 evaluated the minimum yield or transmissivity necessary to meet at least basic hand pump flow rates martínez santos et al 2017 also expanded the manual drilling feasibility process by estimating drill time and cost maps in mali the authors used different penetration rates for alluvial and non alluvial areas and incorporated practical field costs for drilling in the area fussi et al 2017 focused on simplifying this approach with a structured semi quantitative process individual boreholes need only meet four qualifications 1 a static water depth less than 40 m 2 no hard rock shallower than 10 m 3 laterite no thicker than 5 m and yield greater than 12 l min further work led to interpolations and comparisons to multivariate regression models in order to create spatial maps for manual drilling feasibility fussi 2017 the purpose of this study is to address two challenges discovered in the latest feasibility mapping techniques the first challenge was encountered by fussi 2017 while using kriging techniques to interpolate the depth to hard rock in senegal the data was considered to be discontinuous with little spatial correlation the author settled for other interpolation methods such as inverse distance weighting this raises the question is there another way to work with discontinuous variables such as the depth to hard rock or non normal data such as fluoride contamination for the purpose of feasibility mapping for manual drilling secondly literature that clearly defines the hard rock boundary for manual drilling is limited for weathered crystalline aquifers the lithological layers that are considered drillable are often limited to unconsolidated layers above the bedrock such as sand clay and silt fussi et al 2017 martínez santos et al 2017 some resources claim that soft weathered regolith can be drilled manually using percussion methods but no studies have shown how to integrate this information geospatially danert 2015 labas et al 2010 in order to address these challenges this article will start by describing indicator kriging and how it can be practically used to assess those variables that limit manual drilling next the structure of weathered crystalline basement aquifers will be examined this will help to describe how the degree of weathering can be used to define the limits of manual drilling in these environments subsequently a historical dataset of boreholes in the upper east region of ghana will be used to create a feasibility map for manual drilling variables of interest will include well yield water quality static water depth laterite thickness and depth to hard rock finally the implications of these findings for manual drilling in basement rock formations will be discussed 2 theory 2 1 indicator kriging geostatistical methods are a useful technique for the mapping of spatially distributed data in numerous fields including mining engineering hydrogeology and soil sciences oliver and webster 2015 interpolations can be made between individual data points to assess patterns and evaluate the associated error of predictions one particular method kriging is defined as a collection of linear regression techniques that take into account the stochastic dependence among data olea 1991 essentially the data of interest can be assessed for its spatial dependence an unsampled location can be predicted based on its neighboring values by appropriately weighting the distance and variance of the neighboring sample points kriging has the advantage of being an unbiased estimator due to its ability to calculate the range of spatial correlation and a numerical value that compares model accuracy eldeiry and garcia 2011 this is accomplished by using a semivariogram and cross validation techniques the semivariogram is a graph that compares the distance between points and the variance between the value at those points the maximum distance for which there is a correlation between these variables is considered the range of spatial dependence various algorithms such as spherical exponential and gaussian functions can be used to match the curvature of these graphs and create a predictive model oliver and webster 2015 at this juncture the predictive function can be used to perform cross validation cross validation uses every point in a given sample except one to predict the value at the remaining point this value is compared to the original and an error is calculated this process is repeated for every point in the sample producing estimates of the mean error and other statistics for model evaluation esri 2010 ordinary kriging ok requires specific conditions and assumptions for effective modeling typically data should have a normal distribution or be transformed into one marinoni 2003 discontinuities such as faults should be avoided as a smoothing effect occurs fussi et al 2017 however indicator kriging ik is a nonparametric method useful for highly variant or categorical data journel 1983 it does not require normal distributions but rather assigns data into a binary categorical population for instance a sample point does 1 or does not 0 fall under a specific category or a variable exceeds a specific threshold value 1 or falls below it 0 these values are interpolated to create a probability map providing increased knowledge of the study area alli et al 1990 piccini et al 2012 ik has been used to assess soil pollution arsenic contamination nitrate vulnerability and many other conditional qualifiers eldeiry and garcia 2011 piccini et al 2012 jang et al 2016 liang et al 2018 most appropriately marinoni 2003 used ik to improve predictions of geological layer thickness while ordinary kriging would produce thin geological layers where they did not exist a combined ordinary indicator approach helped identify zero value zones where a particular stratigraphy was absent in considering how this concept could apply to factors influencing manual drilling variables such as depth to hard rock could be subject to abrupt discontinuities where different formations occur thickness of laterite could be categorized into zones that exceed a given thickness indicator kriging could identify where these conditions are met in the form of a probability map potential drillers can then decide if the risk within a given region is worth investing and account for an estimated failure rate for the purpose of feasibility mapping this study claims that indicator kriging can offer an alternative approach for interpolating the structured process developed by fussi et al 2017 when non normal data or discontinuous variables exist 2 2 limitations in weathered crystalline basements nearly 40 percent of land in sub saharan africa is underlain by crystalline basement rock formations macdonald and davies 2000 these formations typically consist of three vertical zones the upper weathered the middle fractured and the deep massive zones krásný and sharp 2007 basement aquifers develop within the weathered overburden or regolith and the fractured bedrock productivity and storativity are typically low but sufficient to meet rural needs wright 1992 according to early assessments conducted in sierra leone manual drilling feasibility in basement formations is only available in the upper weathered zone fussi 2011 this definition is best summarized by the compendium developed by danert 2015 where highly weathered crystalline rocks also referred to as regolith or the overburden above the bedrock are considered favorable ideally a quantitative measure of drillability such as the concept of specific energy originally developed by teale 1965 would be used to determine this limitation of manual rigs this concept relates a rock s uniaxial compressive strength ucs to the required percussive and cutting forces enacted by a drill ucs is the maximum axial compressive stress that a right cylindrical sample can withstand before failing zhang 2016 however collecting core samples and testing this measure for an entire region can be time consuming and expensive for the unicef series of country feasibility maps only the composition of the bedrock was available to identify potentially favorable crystalline regions rocks with mixed mineralogical composition and coarse grains were considered more likely to undergo the weathering process this was the best methodology available given an insufficient distribution of borehole logs to analyze unicef 2011 weathering is defined as the physical disintegration or chemical decomposition of earth materials resulting in changes in the color texture composition density or form united states department of agriculture 2012 depending on the weathering profile a given layer can have different mineral constituents hydraulic conductivity and engineering properties viana da fonseca 2003 viana da fonseca et al 2006 fortunately weathering tends to follow a well defined pattern of decay often with a significant loss in ucs abad et al 2016 dearman et al 1978 kulhawy et al 1991 waltham 2002 for the purposes of this study the framework originally developed by dearman et al 1978 to describe a rock s weathered condition will be adopted table 2 defines the six categories used in this study and an example of strength loss for granite united states department of agriculture 2012 fig 1 shows the profile of this framework along with other descriptions for cross referencing abad et al 2016 deere and patton 1971 wright 1992 by combining the theoretical concept of ucs with the practical limits defined by danert 2015 the degree of weathering can act as a proxy for drillability the term soft weathered rock used by labas et al 2010 is ambiguous but could refer to a quantitative measure of uniaxial compressive strength between 1 25 and 5 0 mpa if referencing standard hardness categories united states department of agriculture 2012 thick layers of laterite can also be considered difficult with ucs examples of 824 kpa in nigeria and 2 4 mpa in burkina faso sujeeth 2015 abhilash et al 2016 this would correlate with a limit for manual drilling at the transition between highly and moderately weathered rock depending on the formation waltham 2002 this could also be considered the saprolite to saprock transition or the point where the rock to soil ratio is greater than one abad et al 2016 wright 1992 in the absence of quantitative measures of rock strength the weathering descriptions can provide a more refined definition of hard rock limitations more specifically utilizing borehole records that specify the degree of weathering within a crystalline formation can refine the variable depth to hard rock in fussi et al s approach 2017 to manual drilling feasibility assessments 3 study area the study area for this research is found in the upper east region of ghana between 0 02 and 1 32 west and 10 22 and 11 11 north it is bordered by burkina faso to the north togo to the east and other regions of ghana to the south and west and has a land area of 8842 square kilometers agyekum and dapaah siakwan 2008 the population was projected at 1 27 million people in 2019 with around 80 being rural ghana statistical service 2019 fig 2 shows the region s topography major communities and borehole record locations the upper east region uer has a semi arid climate controlled by the circulation patterns of wet monsoonal air from the gulf of guinea and dry sahara desert air from northern africa agyekum and dapaah siakwan 2008 lutz et al 2007 the mean annual rainfall ranges between 800 and 1000 mm with a unimodal season between may and october diabene and gyamfi 2013 forkuor et al 2013 mean annual potential evapotranspiration typically exceeds the rainfall leading to many surface water sources drying up periodically throughout the year gyau boakye and schultz 1994 kwei 1997 lutz et al 2007 for this reason it is estimated that over 75 of domestic water use is dependent on groundwater gyau boakye and dapaah siakwan 1999 people in the uer are dependent on aquifers that occur either in the regolith completely and highly weathered layers or the fractured zone of the crystalline formations carrier et al 2008 wright 1992 the completely weathered layer s high clay content creates leaky aquifer conditions below while the highly weathered layer provides increased hydraulic conductivity there are also intermittent perched aquifers where coarse permeable material overlays the completely weathered layer for manual drilling the perched aquifers and upper leaky aquifers are considered attainable but the fractured aquifers are deeper than the hard rock boundary and most likely out of reach previous studies in the region have looked at the sustainability of groundwater resources forkuor et al 2013 lutz et al 2007 yidana et al 2015 the potential yield and limitations of the aquifers for rural supply diabene and gyamfi 2013 forkuor et al 2013 gumma and pavelic 2013 and hydrogeological characteristics acheampong 1988 carrier et al 2008 darko and krasny 2007 martin and van de giesen 2005 obuobie 2008 according to agyekum and dapaah siakwan 2008 static water levels had a mean depth of 8 m and the average yield was 48 l min transmissivity is typically in the low to intermediate magnitude in the crystalline formations in the granites the mean transmissivity was estimated at 6 6 m2 d ranging from 0 3 to 114 1 m2 d in the birimian and tarkwaian formations the mean value was 7 4 m2 d ranging from 0 2 to 118 7 m2 d darko and krasny 2007 forkuor et al 2013 bannerman and ayibotele 1984 estimated storativity to fall between 0 003 and 0 008 the mean recharge to groundwater in the white volta river basin is estimated at 7 8 obuobie et al 2012 while martin and van de giesen 2005 estimated a range in ghana between 2 and 13 the majority 92 of the uer is underlain by precambrian crystalline igneous and metamorphic rocks though the southern area consists of palaeozoic consolidated sedimentary rocks adekile and kwei 2009 agyekum and dapaah siakwan 2008 three formations including the birimian eburnean and tamnean have variations of precambrian granitoids mixed with layers of gneiss schist hornblende and biotite evidence of fresh granite bedrock is apparent across much of the region below other formations and often found as the most deeply drilled layer in borehole logs there are thin layers of sand clay and other sediments in the overburden the birimian formation also has sections of metamorphic volcanic rock and basalt in the central area of the uer with additional layers of shale phyllite schist and greywacke the final precambrian formation is the tarkwaian which consists of immature sediments quartzites phyllites and schists two voltaian formations in the south consist of sandstones arkose and mudstones the geological map can be seen in fig 3 drilling programs have occurred in the uer since as early as the 1950 s agyekum and dapaah siakwan 2008 though ngos are involved in drilling activities in the country about 80 of activity is conducted by the private sector adekile and kwei 2009 most contractors utilize light to medium drilling rigs to conduct rotary down the hole techniques there have been records of manual drilling success in the central and upper east regions of ghana specifically near bawku east and bolga tanga in contrast manual drilling has faced challenges in the western region in recent years and evidence has shown those trained in the uer discontinued this practice adekile and kwei 2009 forson unicef personal communication 2019 naugle et al 2013 naugle water4 personal communication 2018 this background information shows why the upper east region is a useful location to apply the indicator kriging technique for manual drilling feasibility first evidence shows that manual drilling has had mixed results in ghana differences in weathering patterns and rock strength could indicate why second the precambrian crystalline formations match the characteristics for a typical weathering profile dearman et al 1978 wright 1992 they have evidence of three vertical zones and interspersed semi confined aquifers in the regolith and fractured zones adekile and kwei 2009 carrier et al 2008 third the degree of weathering is relatively shallow and variable encouraging consideration of non parametric methods agyekum and dapaah siakwan 2008 marinoni 2003 4 materials and methods in order to determine the feasibility of manual drilling in the upper east region of ghana the criteria utilized by fussi et al 2017 will be adopted this includes water table depth well yield laterite thickness and depth to hard rock in addition water quality will be considered in a similar manner as martínez santos et al 2017 each variable will be sub divided into either accessibility availability or quality categories through fuzzy set theory to produce relative feasibility scoring forkuor et al 2013 malczewski 2006 this process is illustrated in fig 4 while the sources of the spatial databases are identified in table 3 the borehole data associated with water quality lithography static water depth and well yield as a proxy for transmissivity is derived from the hydrogeological assessment of the northern regions of ghana project hap carrier et al 2008 2011 groundwater data from six different organizations was consolidated into one database in the northern upper west and upper east regions of ghana accuracy and depth of information varied with each data point so a detailed review was completed to identify unique and reliable records this data has been used in a number of regional studies since completed in 2011 including groundwater development potential sustainability and hydrogeological trends agyekum and dapaah siakwan 2008 carrier et al 2008 forkuor et al 2013 holt 2014 yidana et al 2011 water quality is an important factor when considering domestic water supply geogenic contaminants such as fluoride or arsenic can be correlated with specific geological contexts for instance fluoride contamination in the uer is often connected to bongo granite formations alfredo et al 2014 malago et al 2017 in addition high conductivity can act as a proxy for high levels of iron or manganese in the area the distribution of readings collected from boreholes in the uer was non normal making it difficult to attain accurate interpolations through ordinary kriging ok for this reason indicator kriging ik was used to identify areas where concentrations exceeded recommended levels as specified in table 4 a binary modifier was used to designate at risk 0 and safe 1 cells based on their probability greater than 20 of exceeding the concentration limits for fluoride the measured concentration limit was set to 1 5 mg l according to guidelines set by the world health organization fawell et al 2006 the quality variable shown by equation 1 overlaid the manual drilling feasibility map to denote cautionary zones when using groundwater note that any number of binary variables signaling a risk for harmful contaminants can be applied using this methodology 1 q u f e transmissivity was the variable intended to represent availability but reliable data was limited to only a few boreholes various alternatives were considered as a proxy including well yield specific capacity values derived from step tests and subsequently an empirical calculation for transmissivity forkuor et al 2013 for each ok showed poor performance due to the heterogeneous nature of this variable in hard rock formations darko and krasny 2007 as such ik was once again identified as an appropriate method although it was limited to one threshold at a time well yield y was found to produce the best model due to its higher sample size and spatial distribution based on the technology demand shown in table 5 thresholds at 12 and 30 l min were modeled using ik the next step was to evaluate each component of the accessibility score water table depth could be interpolated using both ordinary and indicator kriging due to its normal distribution a maximum depth of 40 m was chosen according to the limits set by fussi et al 2017 ok results were presented as the depth never exceeded 30 m in this region however a probabilistic map p 1 00 was applied to the final feasibility calculation due to the highly favorable conditions according to fussi et al 2017 and martínez santos et al 2017 laterite thickness should be less than 5 m for manual drilling to be possible if laterite exists percussion techniques are required to penetrate the hard aluminum rich layer further penetrating the weathered rock layers would also require special tools labas et al 2010 laterite is commonly found in the uer so percussion techniques were deemed necessary however its occurrence is discontinuous and interspersed for this reason indicator kriging was utilized again to identify zones with a thickness greater than 5 m to create a binary indicator the final limiting condition for manual drilling is when the depth to hard rock is less than 10 m once again indicator kriging was used to identify zones showing favorable conditions in the crystalline rock formations the novelty of this approach was to incorporate the weathering profile into the assessment fussi et al 2017 describes when hard rock represents more than 50 of the components the layer is assumed to be the upper limit of the basement spatial patterns have been successfully interpolated at this weathered gradation in previous studies for hong kong granite dasaka and zhang 2012 matching the definition in table 2 the maximum limit was designated as the transition between the highly weathered and moderately weathered rock a number of other considerations may challenge this assumption for instance the weathering process can cause both gradual and sharp transitions wright 1992 and kulhawy et al 1991 show that the transition from saprolite to saprock can occur within the highly weathered zone rather than the end further core stones can often be found in the lower portion of the highly weathered zone which if encountered could quickly halt manual drilling progress carrier et al 2008 for these reasons a second comparison map for the depth to hard rock was created in which the transition between completely and highly weathered rock was the limiting boundary for each interpolation that uses ik a probability distribution is produced for the specified condition for instance if the depth to hard rock distribution specifies a probability of 0 60 at a given location this implies that a manual drill would be able to penetrate more than 10 m 60 of the time in real world applications this would translate to the amount of risk a company is willing to take when drilling in a new area for this study the feasibility of manual drilling m is the product of accessibility the depth to the water table the depth to hard rock and the thickness of laterite and availability well yield variables forming a probability distribution through equation 2 a score close to zero suggests a low chance of success while a score close to one implies a high probability of success 2 m p w p l p d p y validation of these results occurred in two stages first cross validation techniques were used to produce geostatistics associated with each interpolation this applied to fluoride concentration conductivity well yield water table depth laterite thickness and depth to hard rock in each iteration one sample is removed from the training set and compared to its predicted value the sum of the errors produced by these iterations are used to calculate the mean error me root mean square error rmse and root mean square standardized error rmsse the me should be around 0 the rmse should be as low as possible and the rmsse should be close to 1 esri 2010 the second validation procedure determined whether each individual reading matched its raster classification for instance a well with historical yield data above 12 l min should be designated as feasible at the optimal binary classification this methodology was also used to verify the results of each interpolation 5 results and discussion the upper east region of ghana was assessed for its suitability for manual drilling using the methodology described above groundwater quality was assessed for fluoride and conductivity to locate cautionary zones within the region groundwater availability was evaluated by identifying areas with sufficient well yield to support handpumps groundwater accessibility was evaluated by identifying areas with shallow water table depth thin layers of laterite and sufficient regolith thickness before encountering hard rock the spatial distribution of these variables informs the feasibility of manual drilling in the region 5 1 quality maps water quality readings from boreholes in the uer were highlighted when high levels of fluoride or conductivity were recorded where high chemical measurements are observed in clusters indicator kriging will show an increased probability of risk according to fig 5 and fig 6 only a few clusters have a probability above 20 for encountering high conductivity and high fluoride from a regional level the high fluoride readings in cluster a are near bolgatanga and bongo which have a history of dental fluorosis british geological survey 2000 firempong et al 2013 this has typically been correlated with the intrusive bongo granite or fluorite and apatite in metamorphic formations in the area alfredo et al 2014 this shows that indicator kriging can be used as a screening process for underlying geological or environmental causes cluster b is associated with just a few readings in the voltaian sandstones but suffer from a low sample density other isolated incidents maintain a relatively low probability because of the number of nearby low concentration readings thus they are more likely to be attributed to random chance 5 2 availability maps figs 7 and 8 show the probabilities that well yield will exceed the recommended handpump flow rates 12 l min or minimum solar pump flow rates 30 l min respectfully fig 7 suggests that handpump requirements are highly likely to be met throughout the region this level of production 12 30 l min can be attained as long as the highly weathered layer can be penetrated which is associated with higher permeability than the completely weathered layer the northwest cluster should be assumed to be at moderate risk of lower yield but the central region should be interpreted with caution due to the decreased sampling density fig 8 shows that most of the uer can expect a lower likelihood of supporting solar pumps emphasizing the importance of using ik at different thresholds about 25 1 of wells were above 30 l min and about 12 0 above 60 l min but they were fairly sporadic carrier et al 2008 found that intrusions by pegmatites or quartz veins in the birimian system as well as deep fractures and fault zones could produce sufficient yield to meet this demand it is unlikely that manual drilling can penetrate these layers in order to take advantage of their preferential pathways as nearly all borehole logs indicate they fall below moderately weathered levels 5 3 accessibility maps ordinary kriging was completed for the water table depth in the uer to determine whether it exceeded the limits of manual drilling as shown in fig 9 it can be observed that the depth to the water table rarely exceeds 20 m and never exceeds the manual limit of 40 m established by fussi et al 2017 every borehole sample has favorable conditions the crystalline bedrock likely forms an impermeable barrier that can only be penetrated by groundwater through secondary porosity at the base macdonald and davies 2000 thus the weathered regolith thickness largely determines the storage and depth of groundwater for these reasons the static water depth is not very influential for the feasibility of manual drilling in the upper east region of ghana in a similar manner there is rarely a layer of laterite that exceeds 5 m martínez santos et al 2017 when indicator kriging was used to determine the probability of exceeding this limit only the southeast corner fell below 80 probability this can be observed in fig 10 however it is very common to encounter some laterite when drilling in the uer with some areas exceeding a probability of 70 this would promote a manual drilling method that includes percussion techniques for the entire region both for the laterite and weathered rock commonly encountered depth to hard rock is the most important limiting factor for manual drilling in the study area fig 11 shows the probability of exceeding 10 m when setting the absolute limit at the top of the moderately weathered layer while fig 12 shows the same conditions when the limit is set to the top of the highly weathered layer when comparing these two figures the probability of success differs significantly depending on what limits are set if a manual drilling rig can penetrate to the moderately weathered layer roughly two thirds of the maps will have a success rate above 40 and east of bolgatanga is highly favorable if the highly weathered layer is considered too hard then three fourths of the study area would have a success rate less than 20 however they both agree that weathering tends to increase from west to east particularly for tamnean granitoids these graphs also depict regional clusters of depth thresholds emphasizing the differences in geospatial weathering patterns that indicator kriging can identify 5 4 data interpolation and validation procedures cross validation was conducted for each interpolation with the summary statistics shown in table 6 it can be observed that mean error me is nearly zero for all included interpolations and the root mean square standardized error was nearly one for every variable but laterite thickness this was due to the fact that only 4 out of 302 samples exceeded the indicator kriging limits without clustering root mean square error rmse was minimized for these variables by adjusting the model range nugget and sill for a given semi variogram stable spherical circular exponential and gaussian models were considered and the optimal statistics were chosen other geostatistical interpolation methods were tested but produced inferior results local uncertainty for these variables could be influenced by a number of conditions including adjacency to unconsolidated sedimentary material near rivers and in valleys seasonal changes in groundwater level local weathering patterns and discontinuous permeability fussi et al 2017 martínez santos et al 2017 macdonald and davies 2000 professional siting and specialized techniques such as vertical electrical sounding should still be used to determine the most favorable drilling locations in a higher resolution area separately low sample density near zebila could skew results and could be refined as the national borehole database increases given this uncertainty secondary validation of the feasibility map was conducted by assessing the distribution of sample points in each classification for example did a borehole classified independently above the fluoride threshold 1 5 mg l fall under the appropriate classification 0 after interpolation was a borehole historically measured at a depth between 10 and 20 m assigned correctly 2 as shown in table 7 nearly every interpolation accurately identified over 90 of the representative sample well yield was the only variable that fell below this level this interpolation tended to overcompensate for the more common designation either below or above the cut off threshold darko and krasny 2007 attributed this to the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the hydraulic properties illustrating how statistical analysis has been the only other practical alternative for assessing crystalline rock formations at a regional scale yet using ok for specific capacity 30 5 calculated transmissivity 60 1 or yield 42 1 produced inferior prediction accuracy likewise predictions for highly weathered 29 5 and moderately weathered 40 0 depth to hard rock were also poor thus the use of ik was shown to offer better performance in comparison to ok but with the cost of losing the continuous though erroneous spatial distributions 5 5 feasibility map combining the groundwater quality availability and accessibility factors produced the manual drilling feasibility maps found in figs 13 and 14 the probability distribution is a product of the depth to the water table depth to hard rock laterite thickness and well yield variables as described in equation 2 fig 13 uses the moderately weathered limit while fig 14 uses the highly weathered limit both use the recommended handpump yield of 12 l min areas with a probability greater than 0 20 for encountering high fluoride or conductivity levels are denoted by hatched caution zones according to historical records manual drilling was successfully completed in the bawku east and bolgatanga districts with sixty boreholes completed as a pilot project adekile and kwei 2009 forkuor et al 2013 observed higher rates of borehole completion for machine drilling when moving from west to east this corresponds with the increased feasibility found in the central and eastern regions in the model with the west being hindered by shallow crystalline formations both limiting conditions agree on this point but they differ in their probability of manual drilling success the moderately weathered limit in fig 13 suggests rates above 90 for certain areas with feasibility rates above 50 spreading farther southwest the highly weathered limit in fig 14 depicts at best a 60 chance of success the combined depictions form an upper moderately weathered limit and lower high weathered limit bound for success and risk the model suggests that the majority of the uer should have sufficient yield to meet domestic demand using handpumps if higher volumes are required it is recommended that mechanized alternatives be considered to take advantage of subvertical fractures veins or faults that are associated with increased production with regards to quality bongo and the southwest voltaian formation should exercise caution from potential contaminants in groundwater considerations should be taken for potential health risks or the increased cost of treatment despite its initial success and efforts to increase interest manual drilling has not been widely adopted in ghana adekile and kwei 2009 naugle et al 2013 challenging geology and regulation of drilling activities were cited as the primary reasons forson m unicef personal communication 2019 percussion drilling is necessary to penetrate both laterite and weathered rock which may be too slow compared with mechanized rigs perhaps mechanized rigs were better supported by the government or hand dug wells were more affordable to potential customers further studies into the politics and local opinions surrounding manual techniques in ghana could prove enlightening alternatively high seasonal variability could render manually drilled wells periodically dry as they are only able to exploit the aquifers found in the upper regolith agyekum and dapaah siakwan 2008 the highest permeability for the manually drilled aquifers would occur within the highly weathered layer encouraging this level of penetration as a precaution in order to consider this factor the original hap assessment included monitoring data for seven wells in the uer for two to five years carrier et al 2011 water table fluctuations ranged from 1 to 6 5 m annually although the water table never dropped below the moderately weathered limit for these monitoring wells this change in elevation could be sufficient to cause a detrimental decrease in recovery bonsor et al 2014 this feasibility map does not account for these changes as data was recorded from different seasons and is limited by this factor another limitation to this technique is the restriction to specific cut off thresholds when using ik the feasibility maps in figs 13 and 14 only represent a well yield greater than 12 l min so other model variants such as fig 8 must be used to assess different levels of production in contrast ok would still be restricted by the smoothing effect of low and high peaks in the dataset the use of weathered rock designations as a limiting condition for manual drilling is based on the assumption that this variable is a proxy for a layer s strength and drillability while this is true within a given rock typology this model considered all weathered classes equal however highly weathered granite is generally considered to be stronger than highly weathered sandstone waltham 2002 this limitation needs to be clearly understood and could skew results towards the lower probabilities of success found in fig 14 even within the same typology qualities such as water absorption roughness fractures and other discontinuities can all influence the strength of rock aydan et al 2014 zhang 2016 a clear delineation using measurable qualities such as shear strength or uniaxial compressive strength could offer refinement to feasibility maps if available at a regional scale perhaps previous measures of drillability such as specific energy teale 1965 kelessidis 2011 could be used to further define the absolute limits of various techniques and allow comparisons between different manual rigs future research should investigate how the type of rock its degree of weathering and its resulting strength can influence manual drillability 6 conclusion this study investigated the feasibility of manual drilling in a crystalline basement aquifer in the upper east region of ghana the methodology developed by fussi et al 2017 and martínez santos et al 2017 was built upon first by incorporating indicator kriging for heterogeneous variables secondly depth to hard rock the most critical variable for this area was more clearly defined for crystalline basements by using the degree of weathering as a proxy for manual drillability more specifically the highly weathered limit acts as a lower bound for success while the moderately weathered limit defines an upper bound the final results suggest that suitable zones occur near bolgatanga bawku and zebila which coincides with historical pilot projects in the region adekile and kwei 2009 due to the non normal and heterogeneous nature of weathered rock and transmissivity in crystalline basements indicator kriging was used as an alternative method of interpolation this methodology offers a probabilistic solution for discontinuous variables such as those encountered by forkuor et al 2013 and fussi et al 2017 using this technique prediction accuracy for both well yield and hard rock depth were improved compared to ordinary kriging but at a cost of the continuous spatial distribution the resulting probability maps produced through ik can be used to estimate the likelihood of success for future manual drilling endeavors in the uer it is critical that seasonal fluctuations be considered during local siting to ensure annual availability while water table depths are well within the limits of manual drilling in this region 30 m or less up to 6 5 m of change were observed further the highest transmissivity is typically within the highly weathered layer so penetrating as deep as possible into this zone is equally important for production lastly precautions need to be taken for fluoride contamination near bongo when utilizing groundwater the methodology presented in this paper allows for screening of regional quality issues for regional planning ultimately the methodology developed in this research can be applied to groundwater databases as they become more refined over time as the local manual drilling sector continues to grow and international organizations continue to promote it future feasibility studies will help to inform new projects encourage professionalization and ensure funding and resources are allocated properly in the appropriate context manual drilling will continue to be an affordable means of accessing water in developing regions acknowledgements this study was funded through the university of oklahoma water water technologies for

12052,manual drilling offers a practical and affordable method of increasing access to groundwater supply in regions struggling with economic water scarcity however manual techniques are limited to specific hydrogeological contexts and must be sited appropriately indicator kriging is proposed as an interpolation method that builds upon previous efforts to identify suitable zones for manual drilling particularly in weathered crystalline basement aquifers this approach allows for heterogeneity within weathering profiles and provides probability mapping of success for regional planning modeling was conducted in the upper east region of ghana using available borehole log data including well yield static water depth laterite thickness depth to hard rock water quality parameters and the degree of weathering indicator kriging interpolations for depth to hard rock predicted binary variables with over 90 accuracy the model predicts that drilling into highly weathered layers will often be necessary to reach the required depths for groundwater use emphasizing the importance of percussion techniques the results suggest that suitable zones occur near bolgatanga bawku and zebila which coincide with historical drilling efforts in the central and eastern portions of the region graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater development water supply crystalline rocks drilling ghana 1 introduction groundwater is an incredibly valuable resource in africa available through numerous and varied aquifers across the continent macdonald et al 2012 in the rural areas of sub saharan africa adelana and macdonald 2008 estimate that roughly 100 million people are dependent on groundwater supply groundwater can provide a reliable resilient and protected source of water for domestic and agricultural purposes lapworth et al 2017 further groundwater can contribute to human development through increased food security poverty reduction and increased health making it critical to the success of the sustainable development goals conti et al 2016 hunter et al 2009 in the right context manual drilling offers a practical and affordable method for accessing groundwater manual drilling replicates mechanical drilling methods but uses human power to dig the borehole martínez santos et al 2017 with proper construction procedures such as sanitary seals and gravel packs a well can effectively protect water quality likewise appropriate siting such as accounting for seasonal variations in water levels can ensure reliable supply manual drilling methods include augering sludging jetting and percussion with each technique more effective in specific geological contexts labas et al 2010 as of 2015 this practice was well established in bangladesh bolivia india kenya niger nigeria and madagascar was gaining traction in chad senegal and zambia and had been introduced in almost 30 other countries danert 2015 manual drilling has its share of advantages and disadvantages according to danert 2015 since lighter equipment is involved it can be moved more easily than traditional drilling rigs while still drilling faster and more safely than digging by hand it also typically costs 4 to 10 times less than machine drilled wells the enhanced affordability can help improve groundwater accessibility compared with the higher costs of mechanized drilling unfortunately manual drilling is limited to relatively shallow aquifers found in soft unconsolidated sediments or highly weathered crystalline rocks the technique is also restricted by its maximum depth with claims ranging from 25 to 50 m fussi et al 2017 gaya et al 2005 martínez santos et al 2017 thomas et al 2012 with these factors in mind table 1 summarizes the criteria that researchers have developed to identify suitable zones for manual drilling geological suitability and water depth are consistently the key factors associated with feasibility maps two recent articles brought new factors into consideration both fussi et al 2017 and martínez santos et al 2017 evaluated the minimum yield or transmissivity necessary to meet at least basic hand pump flow rates martínez santos et al 2017 also expanded the manual drilling feasibility process by estimating drill time and cost maps in mali the authors used different penetration rates for alluvial and non alluvial areas and incorporated practical field costs for drilling in the area fussi et al 2017 focused on simplifying this approach with a structured semi quantitative process individual boreholes need only meet four qualifications 1 a static water depth less than 40 m 2 no hard rock shallower than 10 m 3 laterite no thicker than 5 m and yield greater than 12 l min further work led to interpolations and comparisons to multivariate regression models in order to create spatial maps for manual drilling feasibility fussi 2017 the purpose of this study is to address two challenges discovered in the latest feasibility mapping techniques the first challenge was encountered by fussi 2017 while using kriging techniques to interpolate the depth to hard rock in senegal the data was considered to be discontinuous with little spatial correlation the author settled for other interpolation methods such as inverse distance weighting this raises the question is there another way to work with discontinuous variables such as the depth to hard rock or non normal data such as fluoride contamination for the purpose of feasibility mapping for manual drilling secondly literature that clearly defines the hard rock boundary for manual drilling is limited for weathered crystalline aquifers the lithological layers that are considered drillable are often limited to unconsolidated layers above the bedrock such as sand clay and silt fussi et al 2017 martínez santos et al 2017 some resources claim that soft weathered regolith can be drilled manually using percussion methods but no studies have shown how to integrate this information geospatially danert 2015 labas et al 2010 in order to address these challenges this article will start by describing indicator kriging and how it can be practically used to assess those variables that limit manual drilling next the structure of weathered crystalline basement aquifers will be examined this will help to describe how the degree of weathering can be used to define the limits of manual drilling in these environments subsequently a historical dataset of boreholes in the upper east region of ghana will be used to create a feasibility map for manual drilling variables of interest will include well yield water quality static water depth laterite thickness and depth to hard rock finally the implications of these findings for manual drilling in basement rock formations will be discussed 2 theory 2 1 indicator kriging geostatistical methods are a useful technique for the mapping of spatially distributed data in numerous fields including mining engineering hydrogeology and soil sciences oliver and webster 2015 interpolations can be made between individual data points to assess patterns and evaluate the associated error of predictions one particular method kriging is defined as a collection of linear regression techniques that take into account the stochastic dependence among data olea 1991 essentially the data of interest can be assessed for its spatial dependence an unsampled location can be predicted based on its neighboring values by appropriately weighting the distance and variance of the neighboring sample points kriging has the advantage of being an unbiased estimator due to its ability to calculate the range of spatial correlation and a numerical value that compares model accuracy eldeiry and garcia 2011 this is accomplished by using a semivariogram and cross validation techniques the semivariogram is a graph that compares the distance between points and the variance between the value at those points the maximum distance for which there is a correlation between these variables is considered the range of spatial dependence various algorithms such as spherical exponential and gaussian functions can be used to match the curvature of these graphs and create a predictive model oliver and webster 2015 at this juncture the predictive function can be used to perform cross validation cross validation uses every point in a given sample except one to predict the value at the remaining point this value is compared to the original and an error is calculated this process is repeated for every point in the sample producing estimates of the mean error and other statistics for model evaluation esri 2010 ordinary kriging ok requires specific conditions and assumptions for effective modeling typically data should have a normal distribution or be transformed into one marinoni 2003 discontinuities such as faults should be avoided as a smoothing effect occurs fussi et al 2017 however indicator kriging ik is a nonparametric method useful for highly variant or categorical data journel 1983 it does not require normal distributions but rather assigns data into a binary categorical population for instance a sample point does 1 or does not 0 fall under a specific category or a variable exceeds a specific threshold value 1 or falls below it 0 these values are interpolated to create a probability map providing increased knowledge of the study area alli et al 1990 piccini et al 2012 ik has been used to assess soil pollution arsenic contamination nitrate vulnerability and many other conditional qualifiers eldeiry and garcia 2011 piccini et al 2012 jang et al 2016 liang et al 2018 most appropriately marinoni 2003 used ik to improve predictions of geological layer thickness while ordinary kriging would produce thin geological layers where they did not exist a combined ordinary indicator approach helped identify zero value zones where a particular stratigraphy was absent in considering how this concept could apply to factors influencing manual drilling variables such as depth to hard rock could be subject to abrupt discontinuities where different formations occur thickness of laterite could be categorized into zones that exceed a given thickness indicator kriging could identify where these conditions are met in the form of a probability map potential drillers can then decide if the risk within a given region is worth investing and account for an estimated failure rate for the purpose of feasibility mapping this study claims that indicator kriging can offer an alternative approach for interpolating the structured process developed by fussi et al 2017 when non normal data or discontinuous variables exist 2 2 limitations in weathered crystalline basements nearly 40 percent of land in sub saharan africa is underlain by crystalline basement rock formations macdonald and davies 2000 these formations typically consist of three vertical zones the upper weathered the middle fractured and the deep massive zones krásný and sharp 2007 basement aquifers develop within the weathered overburden or regolith and the fractured bedrock productivity and storativity are typically low but sufficient to meet rural needs wright 1992 according to early assessments conducted in sierra leone manual drilling feasibility in basement formations is only available in the upper weathered zone fussi 2011 this definition is best summarized by the compendium developed by danert 2015 where highly weathered crystalline rocks also referred to as regolith or the overburden above the bedrock are considered favorable ideally a quantitative measure of drillability such as the concept of specific energy originally developed by teale 1965 would be used to determine this limitation of manual rigs this concept relates a rock s uniaxial compressive strength ucs to the required percussive and cutting forces enacted by a drill ucs is the maximum axial compressive stress that a right cylindrical sample can withstand before failing zhang 2016 however collecting core samples and testing this measure for an entire region can be time consuming and expensive for the unicef series of country feasibility maps only the composition of the bedrock was available to identify potentially favorable crystalline regions rocks with mixed mineralogical composition and coarse grains were considered more likely to undergo the weathering process this was the best methodology available given an insufficient distribution of borehole logs to analyze unicef 2011 weathering is defined as the physical disintegration or chemical decomposition of earth materials resulting in changes in the color texture composition density or form united states department of agriculture 2012 depending on the weathering profile a given layer can have different mineral constituents hydraulic conductivity and engineering properties viana da fonseca 2003 viana da fonseca et al 2006 fortunately weathering tends to follow a well defined pattern of decay often with a significant loss in ucs abad et al 2016 dearman et al 1978 kulhawy et al 1991 waltham 2002 for the purposes of this study the framework originally developed by dearman et al 1978 to describe a rock s weathered condition will be adopted table 2 defines the six categories used in this study and an example of strength loss for granite united states department of agriculture 2012 fig 1 shows the profile of this framework along with other descriptions for cross referencing abad et al 2016 deere and patton 1971 wright 1992 by combining the theoretical concept of ucs with the practical limits defined by danert 2015 the degree of weathering can act as a proxy for drillability the term soft weathered rock used by labas et al 2010 is ambiguous but could refer to a quantitative measure of uniaxial compressive strength between 1 25 and 5 0 mpa if referencing standard hardness categories united states department of agriculture 2012 thick layers of laterite can also be considered difficult with ucs examples of 824 kpa in nigeria and 2 4 mpa in burkina faso sujeeth 2015 abhilash et al 2016 this would correlate with a limit for manual drilling at the transition between highly and moderately weathered rock depending on the formation waltham 2002 this could also be considered the saprolite to saprock transition or the point where the rock to soil ratio is greater than one abad et al 2016 wright 1992 in the absence of quantitative measures of rock strength the weathering descriptions can provide a more refined definition of hard rock limitations more specifically utilizing borehole records that specify the degree of weathering within a crystalline formation can refine the variable depth to hard rock in fussi et al s approach 2017 to manual drilling feasibility assessments 3 study area the study area for this research is found in the upper east region of ghana between 0 02 and 1 32 west and 10 22 and 11 11 north it is bordered by burkina faso to the north togo to the east and other regions of ghana to the south and west and has a land area of 8842 square kilometers agyekum and dapaah siakwan 2008 the population was projected at 1 27 million people in 2019 with around 80 being rural ghana statistical service 2019 fig 2 shows the region s topography major communities and borehole record locations the upper east region uer has a semi arid climate controlled by the circulation patterns of wet monsoonal air from the gulf of guinea and dry sahara desert air from northern africa agyekum and dapaah siakwan 2008 lutz et al 2007 the mean annual rainfall ranges between 800 and 1000 mm with a unimodal season between may and october diabene and gyamfi 2013 forkuor et al 2013 mean annual potential evapotranspiration typically exceeds the rainfall leading to many surface water sources drying up periodically throughout the year gyau boakye and schultz 1994 kwei 1997 lutz et al 2007 for this reason it is estimated that over 75 of domestic water use is dependent on groundwater gyau boakye and dapaah siakwan 1999 people in the uer are dependent on aquifers that occur either in the regolith completely and highly weathered layers or the fractured zone of the crystalline formations carrier et al 2008 wright 1992 the completely weathered layer s high clay content creates leaky aquifer conditions below while the highly weathered layer provides increased hydraulic conductivity there are also intermittent perched aquifers where coarse permeable material overlays the completely weathered layer for manual drilling the perched aquifers and upper leaky aquifers are considered attainable but the fractured aquifers are deeper than the hard rock boundary and most likely out of reach previous studies in the region have looked at the sustainability of groundwater resources forkuor et al 2013 lutz et al 2007 yidana et al 2015 the potential yield and limitations of the aquifers for rural supply diabene and gyamfi 2013 forkuor et al 2013 gumma and pavelic 2013 and hydrogeological characteristics acheampong 1988 carrier et al 2008 darko and krasny 2007 martin and van de giesen 2005 obuobie 2008 according to agyekum and dapaah siakwan 2008 static water levels had a mean depth of 8 m and the average yield was 48 l min transmissivity is typically in the low to intermediate magnitude in the crystalline formations in the granites the mean transmissivity was estimated at 6 6 m2 d ranging from 0 3 to 114 1 m2 d in the birimian and tarkwaian formations the mean value was 7 4 m2 d ranging from 0 2 to 118 7 m2 d darko and krasny 2007 forkuor et al 2013 bannerman and ayibotele 1984 estimated storativity to fall between 0 003 and 0 008 the mean recharge to groundwater in the white volta river basin is estimated at 7 8 obuobie et al 2012 while martin and van de giesen 2005 estimated a range in ghana between 2 and 13 the majority 92 of the uer is underlain by precambrian crystalline igneous and metamorphic rocks though the southern area consists of palaeozoic consolidated sedimentary rocks adekile and kwei 2009 agyekum and dapaah siakwan 2008 three formations including the birimian eburnean and tamnean have variations of precambrian granitoids mixed with layers of gneiss schist hornblende and biotite evidence of fresh granite bedrock is apparent across much of the region below other formations and often found as the most deeply drilled layer in borehole logs there are thin layers of sand clay and other sediments in the overburden the birimian formation also has sections of metamorphic volcanic rock and basalt in the central area of the uer with additional layers of shale phyllite schist and greywacke the final precambrian formation is the tarkwaian which consists of immature sediments quartzites phyllites and schists two voltaian formations in the south consist of sandstones arkose and mudstones the geological map can be seen in fig 3 drilling programs have occurred in the uer since as early as the 1950 s agyekum and dapaah siakwan 2008 though ngos are involved in drilling activities in the country about 80 of activity is conducted by the private sector adekile and kwei 2009 most contractors utilize light to medium drilling rigs to conduct rotary down the hole techniques there have been records of manual drilling success in the central and upper east regions of ghana specifically near bawku east and bolga tanga in contrast manual drilling has faced challenges in the western region in recent years and evidence has shown those trained in the uer discontinued this practice adekile and kwei 2009 forson unicef personal communication 2019 naugle et al 2013 naugle water4 personal communication 2018 this background information shows why the upper east region is a useful location to apply the indicator kriging technique for manual drilling feasibility first evidence shows that manual drilling has had mixed results in ghana differences in weathering patterns and rock strength could indicate why second the precambrian crystalline formations match the characteristics for a typical weathering profile dearman et al 1978 wright 1992 they have evidence of three vertical zones and interspersed semi confined aquifers in the regolith and fractured zones adekile and kwei 2009 carrier et al 2008 third the degree of weathering is relatively shallow and variable encouraging consideration of non parametric methods agyekum and dapaah siakwan 2008 marinoni 2003 4 materials and methods in order to determine the feasibility of manual drilling in the upper east region of ghana the criteria utilized by fussi et al 2017 will be adopted this includes water table depth well yield laterite thickness and depth to hard rock in addition water quality will be considered in a similar manner as martínez santos et al 2017 each variable will be sub divided into either accessibility availability or quality categories through fuzzy set theory to produce relative feasibility scoring forkuor et al 2013 malczewski 2006 this process is illustrated in fig 4 while the sources of the spatial databases are identified in table 3 the borehole data associated with water quality lithography static water depth and well yield as a proxy for transmissivity is derived from the hydrogeological assessment of the northern regions of ghana project hap carrier et al 2008 2011 groundwater data from six different organizations was consolidated into one database in the northern upper west and upper east regions of ghana accuracy and depth of information varied with each data point so a detailed review was completed to identify unique and reliable records this data has been used in a number of regional studies since completed in 2011 including groundwater development potential sustainability and hydrogeological trends agyekum and dapaah siakwan 2008 carrier et al 2008 forkuor et al 2013 holt 2014 yidana et al 2011 water quality is an important factor when considering domestic water supply geogenic contaminants such as fluoride or arsenic can be correlated with specific geological contexts for instance fluoride contamination in the uer is often connected to bongo granite formations alfredo et al 2014 malago et al 2017 in addition high conductivity can act as a proxy for high levels of iron or manganese in the area the distribution of readings collected from boreholes in the uer was non normal making it difficult to attain accurate interpolations through ordinary kriging ok for this reason indicator kriging ik was used to identify areas where concentrations exceeded recommended levels as specified in table 4 a binary modifier was used to designate at risk 0 and safe 1 cells based on their probability greater than 20 of exceeding the concentration limits for fluoride the measured concentration limit was set to 1 5 mg l according to guidelines set by the world health organization fawell et al 2006 the quality variable shown by equation 1 overlaid the manual drilling feasibility map to denote cautionary zones when using groundwater note that any number of binary variables signaling a risk for harmful contaminants can be applied using this methodology 1 q u f e transmissivity was the variable intended to represent availability but reliable data was limited to only a few boreholes various alternatives were considered as a proxy including well yield specific capacity values derived from step tests and subsequently an empirical calculation for transmissivity forkuor et al 2013 for each ok showed poor performance due to the heterogeneous nature of this variable in hard rock formations darko and krasny 2007 as such ik was once again identified as an appropriate method although it was limited to one threshold at a time well yield y was found to produce the best model due to its higher sample size and spatial distribution based on the technology demand shown in table 5 thresholds at 12 and 30 l min were modeled using ik the next step was to evaluate each component of the accessibility score water table depth could be interpolated using both ordinary and indicator kriging due to its normal distribution a maximum depth of 40 m was chosen according to the limits set by fussi et al 2017 ok results were presented as the depth never exceeded 30 m in this region however a probabilistic map p 1 00 was applied to the final feasibility calculation due to the highly favorable conditions according to fussi et al 2017 and martínez santos et al 2017 laterite thickness should be less than 5 m for manual drilling to be possible if laterite exists percussion techniques are required to penetrate the hard aluminum rich layer further penetrating the weathered rock layers would also require special tools labas et al 2010 laterite is commonly found in the uer so percussion techniques were deemed necessary however its occurrence is discontinuous and interspersed for this reason indicator kriging was utilized again to identify zones with a thickness greater than 5 m to create a binary indicator the final limiting condition for manual drilling is when the depth to hard rock is less than 10 m once again indicator kriging was used to identify zones showing favorable conditions in the crystalline rock formations the novelty of this approach was to incorporate the weathering profile into the assessment fussi et al 2017 describes when hard rock represents more than 50 of the components the layer is assumed to be the upper limit of the basement spatial patterns have been successfully interpolated at this weathered gradation in previous studies for hong kong granite dasaka and zhang 2012 matching the definition in table 2 the maximum limit was designated as the transition between the highly weathered and moderately weathered rock a number of other considerations may challenge this assumption for instance the weathering process can cause both gradual and sharp transitions wright 1992 and kulhawy et al 1991 show that the transition from saprolite to saprock can occur within the highly weathered zone rather than the end further core stones can often be found in the lower portion of the highly weathered zone which if encountered could quickly halt manual drilling progress carrier et al 2008 for these reasons a second comparison map for the depth to hard rock was created in which the transition between completely and highly weathered rock was the limiting boundary for each interpolation that uses ik a probability distribution is produced for the specified condition for instance if the depth to hard rock distribution specifies a probability of 0 60 at a given location this implies that a manual drill would be able to penetrate more than 10 m 60 of the time in real world applications this would translate to the amount of risk a company is willing to take when drilling in a new area for this study the feasibility of manual drilling m is the product of accessibility the depth to the water table the depth to hard rock and the thickness of laterite and availability well yield variables forming a probability distribution through equation 2 a score close to zero suggests a low chance of success while a score close to one implies a high probability of success 2 m p w p l p d p y validation of these results occurred in two stages first cross validation techniques were used to produce geostatistics associated with each interpolation this applied to fluoride concentration conductivity well yield water table depth laterite thickness and depth to hard rock in each iteration one sample is removed from the training set and compared to its predicted value the sum of the errors produced by these iterations are used to calculate the mean error me root mean square error rmse and root mean square standardized error rmsse the me should be around 0 the rmse should be as low as possible and the rmsse should be close to 1 esri 2010 the second validation procedure determined whether each individual reading matched its raster classification for instance a well with historical yield data above 12 l min should be designated as feasible at the optimal binary classification this methodology was also used to verify the results of each interpolation 5 results and discussion the upper east region of ghana was assessed for its suitability for manual drilling using the methodology described above groundwater quality was assessed for fluoride and conductivity to locate cautionary zones within the region groundwater availability was evaluated by identifying areas with sufficient well yield to support handpumps groundwater accessibility was evaluated by identifying areas with shallow water table depth thin layers of laterite and sufficient regolith thickness before encountering hard rock the spatial distribution of these variables informs the feasibility of manual drilling in the region 5 1 quality maps water quality readings from boreholes in the uer were highlighted when high levels of fluoride or conductivity were recorded where high chemical measurements are observed in clusters indicator kriging will show an increased probability of risk according to fig 5 and fig 6 only a few clusters have a probability above 20 for encountering high conductivity and high fluoride from a regional level the high fluoride readings in cluster a are near bolgatanga and bongo which have a history of dental fluorosis british geological survey 2000 firempong et al 2013 this has typically been correlated with the intrusive bongo granite or fluorite and apatite in metamorphic formations in the area alfredo et al 2014 this shows that indicator kriging can be used as a screening process for underlying geological or environmental causes cluster b is associated with just a few readings in the voltaian sandstones but suffer from a low sample density other isolated incidents maintain a relatively low probability because of the number of nearby low concentration readings thus they are more likely to be attributed to random chance 5 2 availability maps figs 7 and 8 show the probabilities that well yield will exceed the recommended handpump flow rates 12 l min or minimum solar pump flow rates 30 l min respectfully fig 7 suggests that handpump requirements are highly likely to be met throughout the region this level of production 12 30 l min can be attained as long as the highly weathered layer can be penetrated which is associated with higher permeability than the completely weathered layer the northwest cluster should be assumed to be at moderate risk of lower yield but the central region should be interpreted with caution due to the decreased sampling density fig 8 shows that most of the uer can expect a lower likelihood of supporting solar pumps emphasizing the importance of using ik at different thresholds about 25 1 of wells were above 30 l min and about 12 0 above 60 l min but they were fairly sporadic carrier et al 2008 found that intrusions by pegmatites or quartz veins in the birimian system as well as deep fractures and fault zones could produce sufficient yield to meet this demand it is unlikely that manual drilling can penetrate these layers in order to take advantage of their preferential pathways as nearly all borehole logs indicate they fall below moderately weathered levels 5 3 accessibility maps ordinary kriging was completed for the water table depth in the uer to determine whether it exceeded the limits of manual drilling as shown in fig 9 it can be observed that the depth to the water table rarely exceeds 20 m and never exceeds the manual limit of 40 m established by fussi et al 2017 every borehole sample has favorable conditions the crystalline bedrock likely forms an impermeable barrier that can only be penetrated by groundwater through secondary porosity at the base macdonald and davies 2000 thus the weathered regolith thickness largely determines the storage and depth of groundwater for these reasons the static water depth is not very influential for the feasibility of manual drilling in the upper east region of ghana in a similar manner there is rarely a layer of laterite that exceeds 5 m martínez santos et al 2017 when indicator kriging was used to determine the probability of exceeding this limit only the southeast corner fell below 80 probability this can be observed in fig 10 however it is very common to encounter some laterite when drilling in the uer with some areas exceeding a probability of 70 this would promote a manual drilling method that includes percussion techniques for the entire region both for the laterite and weathered rock commonly encountered depth to hard rock is the most important limiting factor for manual drilling in the study area fig 11 shows the probability of exceeding 10 m when setting the absolute limit at the top of the moderately weathered layer while fig 12 shows the same conditions when the limit is set to the top of the highly weathered layer when comparing these two figures the probability of success differs significantly depending on what limits are set if a manual drilling rig can penetrate to the moderately weathered layer roughly two thirds of the maps will have a success rate above 40 and east of bolgatanga is highly favorable if the highly weathered layer is considered too hard then three fourths of the study area would have a success rate less than 20 however they both agree that weathering tends to increase from west to east particularly for tamnean granitoids these graphs also depict regional clusters of depth thresholds emphasizing the differences in geospatial weathering patterns that indicator kriging can identify 5 4 data interpolation and validation procedures cross validation was conducted for each interpolation with the summary statistics shown in table 6 it can be observed that mean error me is nearly zero for all included interpolations and the root mean square standardized error was nearly one for every variable but laterite thickness this was due to the fact that only 4 out of 302 samples exceeded the indicator kriging limits without clustering root mean square error rmse was minimized for these variables by adjusting the model range nugget and sill for a given semi variogram stable spherical circular exponential and gaussian models were considered and the optimal statistics were chosen other geostatistical interpolation methods were tested but produced inferior results local uncertainty for these variables could be influenced by a number of conditions including adjacency to unconsolidated sedimentary material near rivers and in valleys seasonal changes in groundwater level local weathering patterns and discontinuous permeability fussi et al 2017 martínez santos et al 2017 macdonald and davies 2000 professional siting and specialized techniques such as vertical electrical sounding should still be used to determine the most favorable drilling locations in a higher resolution area separately low sample density near zebila could skew results and could be refined as the national borehole database increases given this uncertainty secondary validation of the feasibility map was conducted by assessing the distribution of sample points in each classification for example did a borehole classified independently above the fluoride threshold 1 5 mg l fall under the appropriate classification 0 after interpolation was a borehole historically measured at a depth between 10 and 20 m assigned correctly 2 as shown in table 7 nearly every interpolation accurately identified over 90 of the representative sample well yield was the only variable that fell below this level this interpolation tended to overcompensate for the more common designation either below or above the cut off threshold darko and krasny 2007 attributed this to the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the hydraulic properties illustrating how statistical analysis has been the only other practical alternative for assessing crystalline rock formations at a regional scale yet using ok for specific capacity 30 5 calculated transmissivity 60 1 or yield 42 1 produced inferior prediction accuracy likewise predictions for highly weathered 29 5 and moderately weathered 40 0 depth to hard rock were also poor thus the use of ik was shown to offer better performance in comparison to ok but with the cost of losing the continuous though erroneous spatial distributions 5 5 feasibility map combining the groundwater quality availability and accessibility factors produced the manual drilling feasibility maps found in figs 13 and 14 the probability distribution is a product of the depth to the water table depth to hard rock laterite thickness and well yield variables as described in equation 2 fig 13 uses the moderately weathered limit while fig 14 uses the highly weathered limit both use the recommended handpump yield of 12 l min areas with a probability greater than 0 20 for encountering high fluoride or conductivity levels are denoted by hatched caution zones according to historical records manual drilling was successfully completed in the bawku east and bolgatanga districts with sixty boreholes completed as a pilot project adekile and kwei 2009 forkuor et al 2013 observed higher rates of borehole completion for machine drilling when moving from west to east this corresponds with the increased feasibility found in the central and eastern regions in the model with the west being hindered by shallow crystalline formations both limiting conditions agree on this point but they differ in their probability of manual drilling success the moderately weathered limit in fig 13 suggests rates above 90 for certain areas with feasibility rates above 50 spreading farther southwest the highly weathered limit in fig 14 depicts at best a 60 chance of success the combined depictions form an upper moderately weathered limit and lower high weathered limit bound for success and risk the model suggests that the majority of the uer should have sufficient yield to meet domestic demand using handpumps if higher volumes are required it is recommended that mechanized alternatives be considered to take advantage of subvertical fractures veins or faults that are associated with increased production with regards to quality bongo and the southwest voltaian formation should exercise caution from potential contaminants in groundwater considerations should be taken for potential health risks or the increased cost of treatment despite its initial success and efforts to increase interest manual drilling has not been widely adopted in ghana adekile and kwei 2009 naugle et al 2013 challenging geology and regulation of drilling activities were cited as the primary reasons forson m unicef personal communication 2019 percussion drilling is necessary to penetrate both laterite and weathered rock which may be too slow compared with mechanized rigs perhaps mechanized rigs were better supported by the government or hand dug wells were more affordable to potential customers further studies into the politics and local opinions surrounding manual techniques in ghana could prove enlightening alternatively high seasonal variability could render manually drilled wells periodically dry as they are only able to exploit the aquifers found in the upper regolith agyekum and dapaah siakwan 2008 the highest permeability for the manually drilled aquifers would occur within the highly weathered layer encouraging this level of penetration as a precaution in order to consider this factor the original hap assessment included monitoring data for seven wells in the uer for two to five years carrier et al 2011 water table fluctuations ranged from 1 to 6 5 m annually although the water table never dropped below the moderately weathered limit for these monitoring wells this change in elevation could be sufficient to cause a detrimental decrease in recovery bonsor et al 2014 this feasibility map does not account for these changes as data was recorded from different seasons and is limited by this factor another limitation to this technique is the restriction to specific cut off thresholds when using ik the feasibility maps in figs 13 and 14 only represent a well yield greater than 12 l min so other model variants such as fig 8 must be used to assess different levels of production in contrast ok would still be restricted by the smoothing effect of low and high peaks in the dataset the use of weathered rock designations as a limiting condition for manual drilling is based on the assumption that this variable is a proxy for a layer s strength and drillability while this is true within a given rock typology this model considered all weathered classes equal however highly weathered granite is generally considered to be stronger than highly weathered sandstone waltham 2002 this limitation needs to be clearly understood and could skew results towards the lower probabilities of success found in fig 14 even within the same typology qualities such as water absorption roughness fractures and other discontinuities can all influence the strength of rock aydan et al 2014 zhang 2016 a clear delineation using measurable qualities such as shear strength or uniaxial compressive strength could offer refinement to feasibility maps if available at a regional scale perhaps previous measures of drillability such as specific energy teale 1965 kelessidis 2011 could be used to further define the absolute limits of various techniques and allow comparisons between different manual rigs future research should investigate how the type of rock its degree of weathering and its resulting strength can influence manual drillability 6 conclusion this study investigated the feasibility of manual drilling in a crystalline basement aquifer in the upper east region of ghana the methodology developed by fussi et al 2017 and martínez santos et al 2017 was built upon first by incorporating indicator kriging for heterogeneous variables secondly depth to hard rock the most critical variable for this area was more clearly defined for crystalline basements by using the degree of weathering as a proxy for manual drillability more specifically the highly weathered limit acts as a lower bound for success while the moderately weathered limit defines an upper bound the final results suggest that suitable zones occur near bolgatanga bawku and zebila which coincides with historical pilot projects in the region adekile and kwei 2009 due to the non normal and heterogeneous nature of weathered rock and transmissivity in crystalline basements indicator kriging was used as an alternative method of interpolation this methodology offers a probabilistic solution for discontinuous variables such as those encountered by forkuor et al 2013 and fussi et al 2017 using this technique prediction accuracy for both well yield and hard rock depth were improved compared to ordinary kriging but at a cost of the continuous spatial distribution the resulting probability maps produced through ik can be used to estimate the likelihood of success for future manual drilling endeavors in the uer it is critical that seasonal fluctuations be considered during local siting to ensure annual availability while water table depths are well within the limits of manual drilling in this region 30 m or less up to 6 5 m of change were observed further the highest transmissivity is typically within the highly weathered layer so penetrating as deep as possible into this zone is equally important for production lastly precautions need to be taken for fluoride contamination near bongo when utilizing groundwater the methodology presented in this paper allows for screening of regional quality issues for regional planning ultimately the methodology developed in this research can be applied to groundwater databases as they become more refined over time as the local manual drilling sector continues to grow and international organizations continue to promote it future feasibility studies will help to inform new projects encourage professionalization and ensure funding and resources are allocated properly in the appropriate context manual drilling will continue to be an affordable means of accessing water in developing regions acknowledgements this study was funded through the university of oklahoma water water technologies for

methylene blue the pozzolana has shown good efficiency in the treatment of real textile wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords methylene blue dye pozzolana adsorption wastewater kinetic isotherms 1 introduction effluents released from textile industries are major contributors to water pollution all over the word treatment of industrial effluents to remove the toxic colorants is a challenging task to tackle with these effluents may contain persistent dyes and toxic by products which are very harmful for health of human being and the quality of aquatic life sakalis et al 2006 methylene blue mb is a cationic dye widely used for different dyeing processes for wood cotton silk etc in the event of exposure it may lead to eyes damage mental confusion nausea vomiting and methamoglobinemia rafatullah et al 2010 for the treatment of those persistent effluents several methods such as filtration coagulation flocculation ion exchange reverse osmosis oxidation biopurification mukherjee et al 2016a 2016b and others had been applied belala et al 2011 but these methods require large quantities of reagent and high energy consumption besides generating a huge amount of waste products titchou et al 2020 unlike these methods adsorption based processes have the possibility of using low cost and largely available materials which can effectively be exploited for adsorption removal of toxics from wastewater benafqir et al 2019 djafer et al 2014 keeping these aspects in view many new materials have been studied for the adsorption of dyes from water kaolin based mesoporous silica li et al 2015 clays such as smectites el mouzdahir et al 2010 2007 gil et al 2013 modified pine sawdust zhang et al 2015 edta modified bentonite de castro et al 2018 macoré fruit shells aboua et al 2015 thiourea modified poly acrylonitrile co acrylic acid adeyi et al 2019a 2019b date pits mansour et al 2018 and hazelnut shell doğan et al 2009 are reported as effective materials for the elimination of mb from water pozzolana is a natural porous and homogeneous rock of volcanic origin which is abundantly available in the environment and quite cheap pozzolana adsorbent was already used for the removal of fluoride etawi et al 2018 fluoride and arsenate vazquez mejia et al 2017 from water the sorption capacity of phosphate ion on pozzolana was optimized in batch and column reactors ruby et al 2015 djafer et al 2014 compared biosorption used sulfate reducer cells and adsorption of the red bimacid dye on bentonite and pozzolana remediation of groundwater polluted by chlorophenol was investigated on the laboratory scale using pozzolana by boni et al 2008 in their work the best removal efficiencies obtained with this sorbent were about 65 and 60 using batch and column tests respectively at ph 8 0 8 5 pozzolana was also investigated for mercury adsorption and its efficiency was found to be better than that of activated carbon di natale et al 2006 very recently the adsorption of methylene blue as cationic dye and congo red as anionic dye from aqueous solutions using moroccan pozzolana issued from central middle atlas are carried out by derouich et al 2019 moreover due to the potential use of pozzolana in cement plants arfala et al 2018 it can be considered as a green solution for the adsorption of organic pollutants and getting rid of the sludge formed after adsorption titchou et al 2020 considering the nutriment composition of the formed sludge another solution would be to use it as an amendment of agricultural soils as suggested earlier by afanga et al 2020 thus we have focused on the adsorption of mb in synthesized and real wastewater via a simple batch adsorption experimentation system to the best of our knowledge few research papers are accessible in this field to date the objective of this work is to study the removal of mb dye from its laboratory prepared aqueous solution by investigating its adsorption kinetics and isotherms using pozzolana of south morocco as adsorbent the effect of operating parameters such as adsorbent dosage 0 4 3 0 g l 1 solution initial ph 3 11 initial dye concentration 20 40 mg l 1 reaction time and the effect of the ionic strength were investigated thereafter the protocol was tested on real textile wastewater containing methylene blue as the main dye using pozzolana adsorbent 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbate 2 1 1 methylene blue synthetic solutions methylene blue trihydrate mb chemical structure c16h18cln3s 3h2o used for the adsorption study was purchased from himedia with a molar weight equal to 373 90 g mol 1 and purity of 99 the required amount of mb was dissolved in distillated water to prepare a solution of 1000 mg l 1 desired concentrations were then prepared from the stock solution shimadzu spectrophotometer uv vis 1800 was used to determine the dye concentrations the calibration curve was determined using the maximum absorbance at λ max 664 nm in the range of mb concentrations lying between 2 5 and 40 mg l 1 the ph values were measured with a ph meter ph 211 hanna instrument all reagents were for analytical grade supplied from prolabo and all the aqueous solutions except the real industrial effluent were prepared using milli q water millipore deionized 18 2 mω cm resistivity 2 1 2 real textile wastewater the treatment of textile industry effluents was also studied by the adsorption on the pozzolana these wastewaters were taken from a textile plant located at industrial zone of casablanca city in morocco in june 2019 during the collection period the factory was using methylene blue as a dyeing agent for further analysis hach dr 6000 spectrophotometer was used to determine the concentrations of no3 po4 3 so4 2 cl and the chemical oxygen demand cod of the solutions using their respective hach lange cuvettes test following a standardized method more details of the analysis procedure are given elsewhere zazou et al 2019 standard digital turbidimeter from bante instruments type tb100 turbidity meter was used to measure the turbidity the total suspended solid tss was carried out following the standard method using a pre weighed 0 45 μm filter bod5 values were determined in accordance with the standard methods using lovibond incubator afanga et al 2020 conductivity meter hi 2300 hanna instrument equipped with a conductivity cell was used to determine the electrical conductivity of the real wastewater solution 2 2 adsorbent the pozzolana used in this study was without any further treatment it was collected from es smara region of southern morocco crushed with a ball mill and destined to the moroccan cement plants the particle size of the sorbent was determined by the sieving method standard screens were used to sieve the crushed powder and only fractions lower than 63 μm were used for adsorption purposes scanning electron microscope sem micrographs were obtained with vega 3 tescan microscope at 10 kv fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra were obtained from the 525 to 4000 cm 1 using jasco ft ir 4100 spectrophotometer its chemical composition was determined using sem edax team apparatus and x ray fluorescence using sequential spectrometer of x ray fluorescence bruker s8 based on a scattering of wavelength the chemical composition of the pozzolana collected from es smara moroccan south region given in weight percentage wt of oxides is mainly composed by sio2 74 48 al2o3 6 17 cao 3 98 and fe2o3 2 48 in addition of small amount of p2o5 1 76 na2o 1 80 mgo 1 13 and k2o 0 96 table 1 shows the composition of some pozzolanas found in different moroccan region with their application in wastewater treatments it is worth to note that the composition of the es smara pozzolana differs from those of the others with a light beige color due to the low content of fe2o3 pozzolana of different locality of atlas mountains shows almost the same composition of the constituents the point of zero charge phpzc ph where the solid particle possesses globally a net zero charge is determined by measuring the ph after equilibrium phf versus the initial ph phi of solutions containing the sorbent the phpzc of the sorbent is the ph where the phf is not affected by the reaction time phpzc phi phf mb being a cationic dye has more affinity toward negative charged surface the determination of the pzc of pozzolana is carried out using salt titration method tan et al 2008 for this 50 mg of the adsorbent was added to 50 ml of a solution of 0 01 m kno3 after adjusting the ph of the solution to different values between 2 and 11 by the addition of aliquots of 0 1 m solution of either hno3 or koh then the phpzc is determined by plotting the difference between the final ph phf and the initial ph phi vs the initial ph after 24 h of reaction time at 25 2 c 2 3 batch adsorption of methylene blue mb the batch experiments were carried out in a 100 ml thermostatic beaker containing 80 ml mb solution in contact with desired amount of adsorbent at 25 c under magnetic stirring at 150 rpm the ph of the solutions was adjusted by using 0 1 m solution of hno3 or koh aliquots were taken at appropriate time then filtered using 0 45 nm cellulose acetate membrane filter for further analysis of the residual concentration at a maximum absorbance point λ 664 nm using shimadzu spectrophotometer uv vis 1800 color removal efficiency and dye uptake q t mg g 1 were determined using eqs 1 and 2 1 color removal c 0 c t c 0 100 2 q t m g g 1 c 0 c t m v where c 0

adsorption kinetic models among the most common models pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intraparticle diffusion models are used in this study to describe the adsorption kinetics of mb onto the pozzolana surface the study of adsorption kinetics describes the rate of dyes uptake helps in designing and modeling the adsorption process and describes the diffusion mechanism derouich et al 2019 the pseudo first order model assumes that the rate of the solute adsorbed with time is directly proportional to the difference in the saturation concentration and the adsorbed amount baseri et al 2012 this model is calculated according to eq 4 4 q t q e 1 e k 1 t were t is time min q e and q t mg g 1 are the amounts of adsorbed molecules at equilibrium time and at time t respectively and k 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 the pseudo second order kinetic model which affirms that the chemical adsorption involves sharing or exchanging electrons is the rate limiting step ho and mckay 1999 and it is defined by eq 5 5 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t were t is time min q e and q t mg g 1 are the amounts of adsorbed molecules at equilibrium time and at time t respectively k 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 k 2 is the pseudo second order rate constant g mg 1 min 1 the elovich kinetic model which involves a variation of the energetic of chemisorption with the heterogeneous active sites ndi nsami and mbadcam 2013 is calculated according to eq 6 6 q t 1 β ln α β 1 β ln t here t is time min q e and q t mg g 1 are the amounts of adsorbed molecules at equilibrium time and at time t respectively α is the initial adsorption rate mg g 1 min and β is related to the surface coverage g mg 1 the intraparticle diffusion model indicates the determining step of the adsorption process and describes different transport steps between liquid and solid phases doğan et al 2009 in case where the plot of q t vs t 1 2 is linear it means that the intraparticle diffusion involves an adsorption process and controlled step in case of the null intercept this model is calculated according to eq 7 7 q t k diff t 1 2 c here t is time min q e and q t mg g 1 are the amounts of adsorbed molecules at equilibrium time and at time t respectively k diff is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min1 2 and c is the intercept mg g 1 2 5 adsorption isotherm models in order to describe adsorption mechanism langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich models were used to fit the experimental data according to langmuir model a monolayer sorption occurs on the solid surface with homogeneous and identical sites el mouzdahir et al 2010 the non linearized form of langmuir isotherm is presented in eq 8 8 q e q max k l c e 1 k l c e were q e is the amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium mg g 1 c e is the dye concentration at equilibrium mg l 1 q max is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 k l is langmuir constant l mg 1 freundlich isotherm an empirical equation that indicates the distribution of heat on the adsorbent surface is non uniform which leads to a heterogeneous adsorption as well as a multilayer sorption assuming that the adsorption capacity is related to the concentration of dye at equilibrium el mouzdahir et al 2010 this model is defined using eq 9 9 q e k f c e 1 n here q e is the amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium mg g 1 c e is the dye concentration at equilibrium mg l 1 k f is freundlich constant mg g 1 l mg 1 n n is the intensity of adsorption constant according to temkin isotherm the adsorption is characterized by a uniform distribution of binding energies and the heat of adsorption of all the molecules in the layer decreases with the surface coverage due to adsorbate adsorbent interactions mall et al 2006 the expression of freundlich isotherm model is defined by eq 10 10 q e r t b t ln a t r t b t ln c e were q e is the amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium mg g 1 c e is the dye

the adsorption mechanism can be defined according to dubinin radushkevich model basing on the potential energy assuming heterogeneous surface romanos et al 2011 the non linear form of this model is

dosage fig 1 presents the effect of adsorbent dosage on adsorption capacity and extent of color removal studied at room temperature using 30 mg l 1 of mb in a solution of ph 5 93 for a contact time of 1 h different doses of pozzolana between 0 4 and 3 g l 1 were tested the increase of the adsorbent dosage from 0 4 to 0 8 g l 1 increases the adsorbed amount q t of the dye from 21 to 28 mg g 1 and the adsorption efficiency color removal from 39 71 to 78 87 beyond 0 8 g l 1 the color removal remains constant around 99 and the amount of dye uptake decreases from 28 to 9 85 mg g 1 the decrease in q t could be due to the limitation of the adsorption by the lack of the adsorbate onto increasing the amount of adsorbent as the color removal approaches 100 the decrease in the available surface area resulting from the overlapping or aggregation of adsorption sites would also be the cause of the decrease in q t as reported elsewhere ndi nsami and mbadcam 2013 from these findings it can be inferred that using a concentration of 30 mg l 1 of mb the optimum amount of pozzolana to achieve a maximum adsorption efficiency is 0 8 g l 1 3 1 2 effect of initial ph on mb adsorption the solution ph is a crucial parameter which influences the surface charge of the support and therefore affects the selectivity toward the adsorbate fig 2 presents the variation of the color removal and the adsorbed amount of the dye as a function of the initial ph for a solution of 30 mg l 1 of mb at a contact time of 1 h the results show that the effectiveness of the adsorption increases with the increase of ph from 3 to 7 then it remains constant beyond ph 7 where the color removal and q t reach 84 23 and 35 mg g 1 respectively the obtained result is in accordance with the result of phpzc value which indicates that the ph of charge reversed is 6 5 fig 2 insert beyond this value the surface is charged negatively which presents a higher affinity to the adsorption of cationic mb wu et al 2013 reported that the presence of adsorption phenomena at low ph values is due to the dominance of silica groups which are negatively charged when the ph is above the phpzc which is equal to 2 0 and the charge density of silicates increases along with the ph the increase in ph above the pzc increases the density of negative charges promoting repulsion between the adsorbent particles subsequently allowing the increase in specific surface area and adsorption capacity as indicated by kim 2003 in the case of bentonite silicone and aluminum oxides turn to silanol si oh or aluminol groups al oh in aqueous medium therefore as a function of ph which increases or decreases those groups react with oh or h to form si oh2 and al oh2 or si oh 2 and al oh 2 experimental studies of the adsorption kinetic and isotherms were conducted at ph 9 to ensure the maximum amount of adsorption of mb on pozzolana surface as per the observation shown in fig 2 3 1 3 effect of initial dye concentration and reaction time fig 3 presents the effect of reaction time on the elimination of methylene blue experiments were carried out using 0 8 g l 1 of pozzolana at ph 9 to ensure the maximum adsorption the equilibrium time te when qt remains constant depends of the dye dosage and reaches at 8 min 60 min depending on the concentrations studied 20 40 mg l 1 table 2 for further experiments 60 min is taken as the reaction time the amount adsorbed qe at the equilibrium increases with the increase of the initial concentration of mb fig 4 and table 2 for all concentrations two steps were observed during the adsorption of mb very rapid adsorption in the first 10 min due to the presence of more available active sites on the external surface of the adsorbent nandi et al 2009 however the slow adsorption step may be ascribed to the penetration diffusion of mb into the inner surface of pozzolana hsini et al 2020 3 1 4 effect of the ionic strength on the removal of methylene blue fig 4 shows the effect of ionic strength on the removal of methylene blue from the aqueous medium the experiment was performed using 0 6 g l 1 pozzolana in contact with 40 ml of a methylene blue solution at a concentration of 30 mg l 1 concentrations of nacl and na2so4 ranged from 5 mg l 1 to 25 mg l 1 the results showed that cl and so4 2 do not have any significant effect on the elimination of methylene blue this may be due to the repulsion force between their negative charge and the negative charge on the surface 3 2 adsorption kinetics the adsorption of 30 mg l 1 of mb on 0 8 g l 1 of pozzolana was investigated at ph 9 experimental data were fitted to four different models of adsorption the non linear presentation of pseudo first order eq 4 pseudo second order eq 5 elovich eq 6 and intraparticle diffusion model eq 7 are presented in fig 5 a and b the values of respective fitting parameters for the adsorption of mb onto pozzolana are given in table 3 correlation coefficient values r 2 obtained from the pseudo first order kinetic the second order kinetic and elovich model are 0 9369 0 9997 and 0 9680 respectively the corresponding r 2 of pseudo second order kinetic model value is almost equal to unity this model provides a higher value of q e 36 63 mg g 1 compared to the pseudo first order qe 9 58 mg g 1 which is in agreement with the value obtained experimentally 35 87 mg g 1 based on r 2 and aare values the adsorption of mb on pozzolana fits well to the pseudo second order kinetic the same result was already reported for the adsorption of mb on macore fruit shells aboua et al 2015 and hazelnut shell doğan et al 2009 corda et al corda and kini 2018 reported that pseudo second order kinetic represent better the adsorption of cationic dyes intraparticle diffusion model is also used to obtain more detailed information on the mass transfer mechanism of mb to pozzolana surface q t versus t ½ curve shows two linear segments refer to fig 5b indicating that the transfer occurs under 2 steps the first segment indicates a rapid external surface adsorption correlated with the boundary layer diffusion and the second segment presents the stage of the gradual adsorption equilibrium stage by showing intraparticle diffusion as the rate limiting mechanism during this stage el haouti et al 2019 the intraparticle diffusion rate constants k id were also calculated and gathered in table 3 in our case k id1 k id2 k id1 and k id2 being the slopes of the first and second segment respectively which indicates that the adsorption of methylene blue depended more on the thickness of the boundary layer 3 3 adsorption isotherm models the study of adsorption isotherm was carried out using 0 8 g l 1 of pozzolana in contact with different concentrations of mb 20 25 30 35 40 60 100 and 200 mg l 1 at ph 9 for 24 h of contact time fig 6 a shows the effect of the initial concentration on the adsorption amount of methylene blue the adsorption capacity of pozzolana toward mb increases with the increase of the initial concentration from 20 to 40 mg l 1 then remains constant in fact the adsorbed amount increases from 23 33 to 43 62 mg g 1 this enhancement could be due to the increase of driving force of the concentration gradient which increases the diffusion of dye molecules in the solution toward the surface of pozzolana and then the stabilization may be due to the saturation of the active sites el haouti et al 2019 the distribution of adsorbate molecules at the solid liquid interface can be modelized using adsorption isotherm models the equilibrium data of the adsorption of mb dye on the pozzolana surface were analyzed by nonlinear regression form of langmuir freudlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich isotherm models fig 7 b mohamed et al 2020 the correlation coefficient r 2 values obtained from the linear form of these models are 0 9999 0 7995 0 8241 and 0 6992 respectively the parameters and equilibrium constants derived from different isotherm models used for the adsorption of mb on pozzolana are gathered in table 4 highest r 2 and lowest aare values obtained in the case of langmuir isotherm shows that it describes the adsorption process of the present system mb pozzolana most appropriately the maximum adsorption capacity value was found to be 43 86 mg g 1 and the langmuir constant k l was 1 15 l mg 1 similar result was observed by djafer et al 2014 for the elimination of bimacide dye from aqueous solution using pozzolana with r 2 value of 0 994 di natale et al di natale et al 2006 studied the elimination of mercury ions with pozzolana and results were well fitted with the langmuir isotherm with a high correlation factor for comparison purposes derouich et al 2019 studied the elimination of mb using central middle atlas moroccan pozzolana and it was found that the adsorption fit with langmuir isotherm with a maximum adsorption capacity of 4 14 mg g 1 for basis of comparison table 5 shows the adsorption capacity of our pozzolana and of other adsorbents available in the literature toward methylene blue as it can be seen the pozzolana used in this work presents a higher uptake for mb the adsorption capacity of the pozzolana used in this work was ten time higher than that found by derouich et al 2019 moreover this adsorbent has a high adsorption capacity compared to raw or modified adsorbents cited regarding its abundance low cost and good adsorption capacity this material is an excellent adsorbent for mb dye 3 4 ftir spectra and sem analysis fig 7 shows the ftir spectra of pozzolana before and after adsorption of mb from its solution 20 mg l 1 for 1 h of reaction time at natural ph of 5 93 the principal characteristic bands of ftir spectra were bands observed at 1445 and 1436 71 cm 1 attributed to carbonates groups i e calcite caco3 or dolomite ca mg co3 2 before and after adsorption respectively khoso et al 2019 si o band as an asymmetric stretching vibrations of sio2 tetrahedra observed at 1070 3 cm 1 before adsorption and at 1073 19 cm 1 after adsorption bineesh et al 2010 carriazo et al 2010 djafer et al 2014 si o bending vibration observed at 875 628 and 789 7 cm 1 before and after adsorption respectively bel hadjltaief et al 2014 and si o al observed before adsorption at 560 cm 1 and after adsorption at 571 79 cm 1 li et al 2015 the displacement of the bands and the disappearance of the one around 926 cm 1 which correspond to si o si and si o al stretching vibrations may be due to the interaction between adsorbent adsorbate affirming the adsorption of mb on pozzolana surface heah et al 2012 the surface of the pozzolana was characterized using scanning electron microscopy before and after mb adsorption after 1 h of reaction time fig 8 a and b before use pozzolana has a homogenized surface mainly composed of spherical particles of 10 μm size furthermore fig 8b reveals the formation of the well defined agglomerates particles that may be explained by the hydrophobic attractions sponza et al 2015 3 5 treatment of the real textile effluent for further valorization of the studied pozzolana the adsorption of real textile industry effluent containing methylene blue as the main dye was investigated to assess the effectiveness of the treatment the effluent was characterized by determining its cod turbidity ph and conductivity and the values of these parameters along with the moroccan regulation are given in table 6 the adsorption studies were conducted using 60 ml of textile wastewater with 5 10 15 20 and 25 g l 1 of pozzolana for 1 h of reaction time at 25 c the measurement of absorbance after treatment shows that 20 g l 1 of pozzolana is the optimal dose fig 9 shows the absorbance spectra of the initial solution after being diluted 64 times and after 1 h of effluent treatment without dilution which clearly indicates its total discoloration the main characteristics of textile wastewater after treatment are gathered in table 6 besides the elimination of the color adsorption using moroccan pozzolana drastically decreases the significant characteristic parameters of the effluent this treatment decreases the cod value and cl concentration by about 95 and 100 respectively hence except for the conductivity the treated effluent has all the characteristic properties well within the specific limit values of rejection of textile industries only additional treatment is required in terms of conductivity to comply with the moroccan regulation for the discharge 4 conclusion pozzolana is a natural porous and homogeneous rock of volcanic origin which is abundantly available in the environment and hence is quite cheap the present work is focused on the adsorption of mb on moroccan pozzolana using a sample batch system at 25 c it was found that 0 8 g l 1 of pozzolana has a great ability to adsorb 30 mg l 1 of mb from aqueous medium after 60 min of contact time as showed by uv visible spectroscopy and confirmed by ftir and sem analyses the point of zero charge is determined for the adsorbent and its value was found to be 6 5 however the best adsorption capacity would be achieved at higher ph to insure maximum negative charges on the surface of pozzolana kinetic and isothermal adsorption models were used to find out the most appropriate model describing the adsorption process in this case the pseudo second order kinetic is well suited for the adsorption of mb with an equilibrium adsorption capacity of 36 63 mg g 1 for the isotherm study langmuir model fits well the experimental results indicating a monolayer adsorption on the pozzolana surface the maximum adsorption capacity is found to be 43 86 mg g 1 for further application 20 g l 1 was found to be the optimum amount of pozzolana to treat 60 ml of a real wastewater containing methylene blue as the main dye besides the elimination of the color adsorption on pozzolana decreases drastically the main characteristic parameters of the effluent these parameters respect the specified limit values of rejection of textile industries except for the conductivity of the effluent hence southern moroccan pozzolana can be used efficiently for the treatment of textile effluents containing mainly methylene blue thereafter to avoid regeneration of the adsorbent and its economic and environmental drawbacks such as high capital and operating cost pozzolana dye stuff can be used in cement plant for further valorization due to the potential use of pozzolana as a source of sio2 al2o3 fe2o3 needed in the cement manufacturing the work is ongoing in our lab to better characterize the support cation exchange capacity pore size specific surface area and zeta potential and to find out the influence of temperature which allows the determination of thermodynamic parameters even if the used support presents a high adsorption capacity toward mb compared to other pozzolana it seems interesting to improve its absorption capacity by polyelectrolyte coatings toward specific dyes thermal activation acid activation and combined acid and thermal activation are also planned funding this work is carried out in the framework of the european eranet med water 13 043

isotherms 1 introduction effluents released from textile industries are major contributors to water pollution all over the word treatment of industrial effluents to remove the toxic colorants is a challenging task to tackle with these effluents may contain persistent dyes and toxic by products which are very harmful for health of human being and the quality of aquatic life sakalis et al 2006 methylene blue mb is a cationic dye widely used for different dyeing processes for wood cotton silk etc in the event of exposure it may lead to eyes damage mental confusion nausea vomiting and methamoglobinemia rafatullah et al 2010 for the treatment of those persistent effluents several methods such as filtration coagulation flocculation ion exchange reverse osmosis oxidation biopurification mukherjee et al 2016a 2016b and others had been applied belala et al 2011 but these methods require large quantities of reagent and high energy consumption besides generating a huge amount of waste products titchou et al 2020 unlike these methods adsorption based processes have the possibility of using low cost and largely available materials which can effectively be exploited for adsorption removal of toxics from wastewater benafqir et al 2019 djafer et al 2014 keeping these aspects in view many new materials have been studied for the adsorption of dyes from water kaolin based mesoporous silica li et al 2015 clays such as smectites el mouzdahir et al 2010 2007 gil et al 2013 modified pine sawdust zhang et al 2015 edta modified bentonite de castro et al 2018 macoré fruit shells aboua et al 2015 thiourea modified poly acrylonitrile co acrylic acid adeyi et al 2019a 2019b date pits mansour et al 2018 and hazelnut shell doğan et al 2009 are reported as effective materials for the elimination of mb from water pozzolana is a natural porous and homogeneous rock of volcanic origin which is abundantly available in the environment and quite cheap pozzolana adsorbent was already used for the removal of fluoride etawi et al 2018 fluoride and arsenate vazquez mejia et al 2017 from water the sorption capacity of phosphate ion on pozzolana was optimized in batch and column reactors ruby et al 2015 djafer et al 2014 compared biosorption used sulfate reducer cells and adsorption of the red bimacid dye on bentonite and pozzolana remediation of groundwater polluted by chlorophenol was investigated on the laboratory scale using pozzolana by boni et al 2008 in their work the best removal efficiencies obtained with this sorbent were about 65 and 60 using batch and column tests respectively at ph 8 0 8 5 pozzolana was also investigated for mercury adsorption and its efficiency was found to be better than that of activated carbon di natale et al 2006 very recently the adsorption of methylene blue as cationic dye and congo red as anionic dye from aqueous solutions using moroccan pozzolana issued from central middle atlas are carried out by derouich et al 2019 moreover due to the potential use of pozzolana in cement plants arfala et al 2018 it can be considered as a green solution for the adsorption of organic pollutants and getting rid of the sludge formed after adsorption titchou et al 2020 considering the nutriment composition of the formed sludge another solution would be to use it as an amendment of agricultural soils as suggested earlier by afanga et al 2020 thus we have focused on the adsorption of mb in synthesized and real wastewater via a simple batch adsorption experimentation system to the best of our knowledge few research papers are accessible in this field to date the objective of this work is to study the removal of mb dye from its laboratory prepared aqueous solution by investigating its adsorption kinetics and isotherms using pozzolana of south morocco as adsorbent the effect of operating parameters such as adsorbent dosage 0 4 3 0 g l 1 solution initial ph 3 11 initial dye concentration 20 40 mg l 1 reaction time and the effect of the ionic strength were investigated thereafter the protocol was tested on real textile wastewater containing methylene blue as the main dye using pozzolana adsorbent 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbate 2 1 1 methylene blue synthetic solutions methylene blue trihydrate mb chemical structure c16h18cln3s 3h2o used for the adsorption study was purchased from himedia with a molar weight equal to 373 90 g mol 1 and purity of 99 the required amount of mb was dissolved in distillated water to prepare a solution of 1000 mg l 1 desired concentrations were then prepared from the stock solution shimadzu spectrophotometer uv vis 1800 was used to determine the dye concentrations the calibration curve was determined using the maximum absorbance at λ max 664 nm in the range of mb concentrations lying between 2 5 and 40 mg l 1 the ph values were measured with a ph meter ph 211 hanna instrument all reagents were for analytical grade supplied from prolabo and all the aqueous solutions except the real industrial effluent were prepared using milli q water millipore deionized 18 2 mω cm resistivity 2 1 2 real textile wastewater the treatment of textile industry effluents was also studied by the adsorption on the pozzolana these wastewaters were taken from a textile plant located at industrial zone of casablanca city in morocco in june 2019 during the collection period the factory was using methylene blue as a dyeing agent for further analysis hach dr 6000 spectrophotometer was used to determine the concentrations of no3 po4 3 so4 2 cl and the chemical oxygen demand cod of the solutions using their respective hach lange cuvettes test following a standardized method more details of the analysis procedure are given elsewhere zazou et al 2019 standard digital turbidimeter from bante instruments type tb100 turbidity meter was used to measure the turbidity the total suspended solid tss was carried out following the standard method using a pre weighed 0 45 μm filter bod5 values were determined in accordance with the standard methods using lovibond incubator afanga et al 2020 conductivity meter hi 2300 hanna instrument equipped with a conductivity cell was used to determine the electrical conductivity of the real wastewater solution 2 2 adsorbent the pozzolana used in this study was without any further treatment it was collected from es smara region of southern morocco crushed with a ball mill and destined to the moroccan cement plants the particle size of the sorbent was determined by the sieving method standard screens were used to sieve the crushed powder and only fractions lower than 63 μm were used for adsorption purposes scanning electron microscope sem micrographs were obtained with vega 3 tescan microscope at 10 kv fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra were obtained from the 525 to 4000 cm 1 using jasco ft ir 4100 spectrophotometer its chemical composition was determined using sem edax team apparatus and x ray fluorescence using sequential spectrometer of x ray fluorescence bruker s8 based on a scattering of wavelength the chemical composition of the pozzolana collected from es smara moroccan south region given in weight percentage wt of oxides is mainly composed by sio2 74 48 al2o3 6 17 cao 3 98 and fe2o3 2 48 in addition of small amount of p2o5 1 76 na2o 1 80 mgo 1 13 and k2o 0 96 table 1 shows the composition of some pozzolanas found in different moroccan region with their application in wastewater treatments it is worth to note that the composition of the es smara pozzolana differs from those of the others with a light beige color due to the low content of fe2o3 pozzolana of different locality of atlas mountains shows almost the same composition of the constituents the point of zero charge phpzc ph where the solid particle possesses globally a net zero charge is determined by measuring the ph after equilibrium phf versus the initial ph phi of solutions containing the sorbent the phpzc of the sorbent is the ph where the phf is not affected by the reaction time phpzc phi phf mb being a cationic dye has more affinity toward negative charged surface the determination of the pzc of pozzolana is carried out using salt titration method tan et al 2008 for this 50 mg of the adsorbent was added to 50 ml of a solution of 0 01 m kno3 after adjusting the ph of the solution to different values between 2 and 11 by the addition of aliquots of 0 1 m solution of either hno3 or koh then the phpzc is determined by plotting the difference between the final ph phf and the initial ph phi vs the initial ph after 24 h of reaction time at 25 2 c 2 3 batch adsorption of methylene blue mb the batch experiments were carried out in a 100 ml thermostatic beaker containing 80 ml mb solution in contact with desired amount of adsorbent at 25 c under magnetic stirring at 150 rpm the ph of the solutions was adjusted by using 0 1 m solution of hno3 or koh aliquots were taken at appropriate time then filtered using 0 45 nm cellulose acetate membrane filter for further analysis of the residual concentration at a maximum absorbance point λ 664 nm using shimadzu spectrophotometer uv vis 1800 color removal efficiency and dye uptake q t mg g 1 were determined using eqs 1 and 2 1 color removal c 0 c t c 0 100 2 q t m g g 1 c 0 c t m v where c 0

adsorption kinetic models among the most common models pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intraparticle diffusion models are used in this study to describe the adsorption kinetics of mb onto the pozzolana surface the study of adsorption kinetics describes the rate of dyes uptake helps in designing and modeling the adsorption process and describes the diffusion mechanism derouich et al 2019 the pseudo first order model assumes that the rate of the solute adsorbed with time is directly proportional to the difference in the saturation concentration and the adsorbed amount baseri et al 2012 this model is calculated according to eq 4 4 q t q e 1 e k 1 t were t is time min q e and q t mg g 1 are the amounts of adsorbed molecules at equilibrium time and at time t respectively and k 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 the pseudo second order kinetic model which affirms that the chemical adsorption involves sharing or exchanging electrons is the rate limiting step ho and mckay 1999 and it is defined by eq 5 5 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t were t is time min q e and q t mg g 1 are the amounts of adsorbed molecules at equilibrium time and at time t respectively k 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 k 2 is the pseudo second order rate constant g mg 1 min 1 the elovich kinetic model which involves a variation of the energetic of chemisorption with the heterogeneous active sites ndi nsami and mbadcam 2013 is calculated according to eq 6 6 q t 1 β ln α β 1 β ln t here t is time min q e and q t mg g 1 are the amounts of adsorbed molecules at equilibrium time and at time t respectively α is the initial adsorption rate mg g 1 min and β is related to the surface coverage g mg 1 the intraparticle diffusion model indicates the determining step of the adsorption process and describes different transport steps between liquid and solid phases doğan et al 2009 in case where the plot of q t vs t 1 2 is linear it means that the intraparticle diffusion involves an adsorption process and controlled step in case of the null intercept this model is calculated according to eq 7 7 q t k diff t 1 2 c here t is time min q e and q t mg g 1 are the amounts of adsorbed molecules at equilibrium time and at time t respectively k diff is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min1 2 and c is the intercept mg g 1 2 5 adsorption isotherm models in order to describe adsorption mechanism langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich models were used to fit the experimental data according to langmuir model a monolayer sorption occurs on the solid surface with homogeneous and identical sites el mouzdahir et al 2010 the non linearized form of langmuir isotherm is presented in eq 8 8 q e q max k l c e 1 k l c e were q e is the amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium mg g 1 c e is the dye concentration at equilibrium mg l 1 q max is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 k l is langmuir constant l mg 1 freundlich isotherm an empirical equation that indicates the distribution of heat on the adsorbent surface is non uniform which leads to a heterogeneous adsorption as well as a multilayer sorption assuming that the adsorption capacity is related to the concentration of dye at equilibrium el mouzdahir et al 2010 this model is defined using eq 9 9 q e k f c e 1 n here q e is the amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium mg g 1 c e is the dye concentration at equilibrium mg l 1 k f is freundlich constant mg g 1 l mg 1 n n is the intensity of adsorption constant according to temkin isotherm the adsorption is characterized by a uniform distribution of binding energies and the heat of adsorption of all the molecules in the layer decreases with the surface coverage due to adsorbate adsorbent interactions mall et al 2006 the expression of freundlich isotherm model is defined by eq 10 10 q e r t b t ln a t r t b t ln c e were q e is the amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium mg g 1 c e is the dye

the adsorption mechanism can be defined according to dubinin radushkevich model basing on the potential energy assuming heterogeneous surface romanos et al 2011 the non linear form of this model is

dosage fig 1 presents the effect of adsorbent dosage on adsorption capacity and extent of color removal studied at room temperature using 30 mg l 1 of mb in a solution of ph 5 93 for a contact time of 1 h different doses of pozzolana between 0 4 and 3 g l 1 were tested the increase of the adsorbent dosage from 0 4 to 0 8 g l 1 increases the adsorbed amount q t of the dye from 21 to 28 mg g 1 and the adsorption efficiency color removal from 39 71 to 78 87 beyond 0 8 g l 1 the color removal remains constant around 99 and the amount of dye uptake decreases from 28 to 9 85 mg g 1 the decrease in q t could be due to the limitation of the adsorption by the lack of the adsorbate onto increasing the amount of adsorbent as the color removal approaches 100 the decrease in the available surface area resulting from the overlapping or aggregation of adsorption sites would also be the cause of the decrease in q t as reported elsewhere ndi nsami and mbadcam 2013 from these findings it can be inferred that using a concentration of 30 mg l 1 of mb the optimum amount of pozzolana to achieve a maximum adsorption efficiency is 0 8 g l 1 3 1 2 effect of initial ph on mb adsorption the solution ph is a crucial parameter which influences the surface charge of the support and therefore affects the selectivity toward the adsorbate fig 2 presents the variation of the color removal and the adsorbed amount of the dye as a function of the initial ph for a solution of 30 mg l 1 of mb at a contact time of 1 h the results show that the effectiveness of the adsorption increases with the increase of ph from 3 to 7 then it remains constant beyond ph 7 where the color removal and q t reach 84 23 and 35 mg g 1 respectively the obtained result is in accordance with the result of phpzc value which indicates that the ph of charge reversed is 6 5 fig 2 insert beyond this value the surface is charged negatively which presents a higher affinity to the adsorption of cationic mb wu et al 2013 reported that the presence of adsorption phenomena at low ph values is due to the dominance of silica groups which are negatively charged when the ph is above the phpzc which is equal to 2 0 and the charge density of silicates increases along with the ph the increase in ph above the pzc increases the density of negative charges promoting repulsion between the adsorbent particles subsequently allowing the increase in specific surface area and adsorption capacity as indicated by kim 2003 in the case of bentonite silicone and aluminum oxides turn to silanol si oh or aluminol groups al oh in aqueous medium therefore as a function of ph which increases or decreases those groups react with oh or h to form si oh2 and al oh2 or si oh 2 and al oh 2 experimental studies of the adsorption kinetic and isotherms were conducted at ph 9 to ensure the maximum amount of adsorption of mb on pozzolana surface as per the observation shown in fig 2 3 1 3 effect of initial dye concentration and reaction time fig 3 presents the effect of reaction time on the elimination of methylene blue experiments were carried out using 0 8 g l 1 of pozzolana at ph 9 to ensure the maximum adsorption the equilibrium time te when qt remains constant depends of the dye dosage and reaches at 8 min 60 min depending on the concentrations studied 20 40 mg l 1 table 2 for further experiments 60 min is taken as the reaction time the amount adsorbed qe at the equilibrium increases with the increase of the initial concentration of mb fig 4 and table 2 for all concentrations two steps were observed during the adsorption of mb very rapid adsorption in the first 10 min due to the presence of more available active sites on the external surface of the adsorbent nandi et al 2009 however the slow adsorption step may be ascribed to the penetration diffusion of mb into the inner surface of pozzolana hsini et al 2020 3 1 4 effect of the ionic strength on the removal of methylene blue fig 4 shows the effect of ionic strength on the removal of methylene blue from the aqueous medium the experiment was performed using 0 6 g l 1 pozzolana in contact with 40 ml of a methylene blue solution at a concentration of 30 mg l 1 concentrations of nacl and na2so4 ranged from 5 mg l 1 to 25 mg l 1 the results showed that cl and so4 2 do not have any significant effect on the elimination of methylene blue this may be due to the repulsion force between their negative charge and the negative charge on the surface 3 2 adsorption kinetics the adsorption of 30 mg l 1 of mb on 0 8 g l 1 of pozzolana was investigated at ph 9 experimental data were fitted to four different models of adsorption the non linear presentation of pseudo first order eq 4 pseudo second order eq 5 elovich eq 6 and intraparticle diffusion model eq 7 are presented in fig 5 a and b the values of respective fitting parameters for the adsorption of mb onto pozzolana are given in table 3 correlation coefficient values r 2 obtained from the pseudo first order kinetic the second order kinetic and elovich model are 0 9369 0 9997 and 0 9680 respectively the corresponding r 2 of pseudo second order kinetic model value is almost equal to unity this model provides a higher value of q e 36 63 mg g 1 compared to the pseudo first order qe 9 58 mg g 1 which is in agreement with the value obtained experimentally 35 87 mg g 1 based on r 2 and aare values the adsorption of mb on pozzolana fits well to the pseudo second order kinetic the same result was already reported for the adsorption of mb on macore fruit shells aboua et al 2015 and hazelnut shell doğan et al 2009 corda et al corda and kini 2018 reported that pseudo second order kinetic represent better the adsorption of cationic dyes intraparticle diffusion model is also used to obtain more detailed information on the mass transfer mechanism of mb to pozzolana surface q t versus t ½ curve shows two linear segments refer to fig 5b indicating that the transfer occurs under 2 steps the first segment indicates a rapid external surface adsorption correlated with the boundary layer diffusion and the second segment presents the stage of the gradual adsorption equilibrium stage by showing intraparticle diffusion as the rate limiting mechanism during this stage el haouti et al 2019 the intraparticle diffusion rate constants k id were also calculated and gathered in table 3 in our case k id1 k id2 k id1 and k id2 being the slopes of the first and second segment respectively which indicates that the adsorption of methylene blue depended more on the thickness of the boundary layer 3 3 adsorption isotherm models the study of adsorption isotherm was carried out using 0 8 g l 1 of pozzolana in contact with different concentrations of mb 20 25 30 35 40 60 100 and 200 mg l 1 at ph 9 for 24 h of contact time fig 6 a shows the effect of the initial concentration on the adsorption amount of methylene blue the adsorption capacity of pozzolana toward mb increases with the increase of the initial concentration from 20 to 40 mg l 1 then remains constant in fact the adsorbed amount increases from 23 33 to 43 62 mg g 1 this enhancement could be due to the increase of driving force of the concentration gradient which increases the diffusion of dye molecules in the solution toward the surface of pozzolana and then the stabilization may be due to the saturation of the active sites el haouti et al 2019 the distribution of adsorbate molecules at the solid liquid interface can be modelized using adsorption isotherm models the equilibrium data of the adsorption of mb dye on the pozzolana surface were analyzed by nonlinear regression form of langmuir freudlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich isotherm models fig 7 b mohamed et al 2020 the correlation coefficient r 2 values obtained from the linear form of these models are 0 9999 0 7995 0 8241 and 0 6992 respectively the parameters and equilibrium constants derived from different isotherm models used for the adsorption of mb on pozzolana are gathered in table 4 highest r 2 and lowest aare values obtained in the case of langmuir isotherm shows that it describes the adsorption process of the present system mb pozzolana most appropriately the maximum adsorption capacity value was found to be 43 86 mg g 1 and the langmuir constant k l was 1 15 l mg 1 similar result was observed by djafer et al 2014 for the elimination of bimacide dye from aqueous solution using pozzolana with r 2 value of 0 994 di natale et al di natale et al 2006 studied the elimination of mercury ions with pozzolana and results were well fitted with the langmuir isotherm with a high correlation factor for comparison purposes derouich et al 2019 studied the elimination of mb using central middle atlas moroccan pozzolana and it was found that the adsorption fit with langmuir isotherm with a maximum adsorption capacity of 4 14 mg g 1 for basis of comparison table 5 shows the adsorption capacity of our pozzolana and of other adsorbents available in the literature toward methylene blue as it can be seen the pozzolana used in this work presents a higher uptake for mb the adsorption capacity of the pozzolana used in this work was ten time higher than that found by derouich et al 2019 moreover this adsorbent has a high adsorption capacity compared to raw or modified adsorbents cited regarding its abundance low cost and good adsorption capacity this material is an excellent adsorbent for mb dye 3 4 ftir spectra and sem analysis fig 7 shows the ftir spectra of pozzolana before and after adsorption of mb from its solution 20 mg l 1 for 1 h of reaction time at natural ph of 5 93 the principal characteristic bands of ftir spectra were bands observed at 1445 and 1436 71 cm 1 attributed to carbonates groups i e calcite caco3 or dolomite ca mg co3 2 before and after adsorption respectively khoso et al 2019 si o band as an asymmetric stretching vibrations of sio2 tetrahedra observed at 1070 3 cm 1 before adsorption and at 1073 19 cm 1 after adsorption bineesh et al 2010 carriazo et al 2010 djafer et al 2014 si o bending vibration observed at 875 628 and 789 7 cm 1 before and after adsorption respectively bel hadjltaief et al 2014 and si o al observed before adsorption at 560 cm 1 and after adsorption at 571 79 cm 1 li et al 2015 the displacement of the bands and the disappearance of the one around 926 cm 1 which correspond to si o si and si o al stretching vibrations may be due to the interaction between adsorbent adsorbate affirming the adsorption of mb on pozzolana surface heah et al 2012 the surface of the pozzolana was characterized using scanning electron microscopy before and after mb adsorption after 1 h of reaction time fig 8 a and b before use pozzolana has a homogenized surface mainly composed of spherical particles of 10 μm size furthermore fig 8b reveals the formation of the well defined agglomerates particles that may be explained by the hydrophobic attractions sponza et al 2015 3 5 treatment of the real textile effluent for further valorization of the studied pozzolana the adsorption of real textile industry effluent containing methylene blue as the main dye was investigated to assess the effectiveness of the treatment the effluent was characterized by determining its cod turbidity ph and conductivity and the values of these parameters along with the moroccan regulation are given in table 6 the adsorption studies were conducted using 60 ml of textile wastewater with 5 10 15 20 and 25 g l 1 of pozzolana for 1 h of reaction time at 25 c the measurement of absorbance after treatment shows that 20 g l 1 of pozzolana is the optimal dose fig 9 shows the absorbance spectra of the initial solution after being diluted 64 times and after 1 h of effluent treatment without dilution which clearly indicates its total discoloration the main characteristics of textile wastewater after treatment are gathered in table 6 besides the elimination of the color adsorption using moroccan pozzolana drastically decreases the significant characteristic parameters of the effluent this treatment decreases the cod value and cl concentration by about 95 and 100 respectively hence except for the conductivity the treated effluent has all the characteristic properties well within the specific limit values of rejection of textile industries only additional treatment is required in terms of conductivity to comply with the moroccan regulation for the discharge 4 conclusion pozzolana is a natural porous and homogeneous rock of volcanic origin which is abundantly available in the environment and hence is quite cheap the present work is focused on the adsorption of mb on moroccan pozzolana using a sample batch system at 25 c it was found that 0 8 g l 1 of pozzolana has a great ability to adsorb 30 mg l 1 of mb from aqueous medium after 60 min of contact time as showed by uv visible spectroscopy and confirmed by ftir and sem analyses the point of zero charge is determined for the adsorbent and its value was found to be 6 5 however the best adsorption capacity would be achieved at higher ph to insure maximum negative charges on the surface of pozzolana kinetic and isothermal adsorption models were used to find out the most appropriate model describing the adsorption process in this case the pseudo second order kinetic is well suited for the adsorption of mb with an equilibrium adsorption capacity of 36 63 mg g 1 for the isotherm study langmuir model fits well the experimental results indicating a monolayer adsorption on the pozzolana surface the maximum adsorption capacity is found to be 43 86 mg g 1 for further application 20 g l 1 was found to be the optimum amount of pozzolana to treat 60 ml of a real wastewater containing methylene blue as the main dye besides the elimination of the color adsorption on pozzolana decreases drastically the main characteristic parameters of the effluent these parameters respect the specified limit values of rejection of textile industries except for the conductivity of the effluent hence southern moroccan pozzolana can be used efficiently for the treatment of textile effluents containing mainly methylene blue thereafter to avoid regeneration of the adsorbent and its economic and environmental drawbacks such as high capital and operating cost pozzolana dye stuff can be used in cement plant for further valorization due to the potential use of pozzolana as a source of sio2 al2o3 fe2o3 needed in the cement manufacturing the work is ongoing in our lab to better characterize the support cation exchange capacity pore size specific surface area and zeta potential and to find out the influence of temperature which allows the determination of thermodynamic parameters even if the used support presents a high adsorption capacity toward mb compared to other pozzolana it seems interesting to improve its absorption capacity by polyelectrolyte coatings toward specific dyes thermal activation acid activation and combined acid and thermal activation are also planned funding this work is carried out in the framework of the european eranet med water 13 043

12054,pressure on groundwater resources is continuously increasing day by day in west guji zone southern ethiopia due to urbanization so this research introduces the integration of various methods like geographical information system gis remote sensing rs analytical hierarchy process ahp and two dimensional electrical resistivity imaging 2d eri technique for assessing the accurate and reliable sources of groundwater in the study area to delineate groundwater potentiality seven main criteria like lithology drainage density lineament density soil texture geomorphology slope and land use cover were identified based on the regional characteristics field surveys local information and literature review weightage for each thematic layer was consequently done by gis based ahp weighted overlay analysis techniques and classified into three categories which represent high 247 69 km2 moderate 1314 79 km2 and low 4883 61 km2 respectively high potential zones are mainly found in escarpment areas due to the presence of highly weathered and fractured rocks at last results were validated with borehole yield data and 2d eri survey the coordinates of each borehole yield data have been transferred to gis platforms and it clearly shows that 4 out of 5 sample points were matching with 5 l s in high potential zones 2d eri was conducted in the high potential zone for cross validating the results and it indicates that the area was covered by water bearing formation with resistivity values of 30 ωm to 162 ωm respectively therefore these tools are very effective for groundwater sustainable development and indispensable for planning and utilization of groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords borehole yield data two dimensional electrical resistivity imaging geographical information system remote sensing analytical hierarchy process 1 introduction groundwater represents the second most abundantly available freshwater resources in the entire world and it is governed by factors like availability accessibility transportability and cost effectiveness shrestha et al 2016 the quantity of groundwater recovered from an aquifer system is important especially for domestic irrigation and industrial sectors nowadays groundwater exploring and exploiting are carried out without taking cognizance of the different subsurface units that could assist in the proper delineation of productive aquifer units falowo et al 2017 this consequently leads to abortive bore holes low yield wells total failure of wells and adulterated water therefore sustainable use of groundwater resource is highly expedient to prevent a decrease in water tables level environmental degradation rising pumping costs of wells and reduction of yield in a country like ethiopia people often face acute water scarcity due to rapid population growth and monsoon failure as results of this surface water is not available round the year for meeting different purposes and hence people in such areas have to depend more on groundwater resources for their survival unesco 2004 ahmad et al 2019 hence it requires the preparation of suitable plans for efficient groundwater management groundwater is the

weathering and fracture zones that vary from place to place under the influence of different hydrological settings suhag 2016 rahmati et al 2015 the conventional and reliable methods like drilling test and stratigraphy analysis used to locate groundwater in hard rock terrains are very much expensive and time consuming gopinathan et al 2020 presently geographical information system gis and

groundwater resources many of the previous studies have utilized the gis and rs technology in groundwater related studies das et al 1997 vasanthavigar et al 2012 singh et al 2013 politi et al 2016 gangadharan and nila rekha 2019 and it helps a lot in improving the ability to locate groundwater potential zones in hard rock terrains saraf and choudhary 1998 pratap et al 2000 srinivasa rao and jugran 2003 kumar et al 2008 oh and lee 2011 naghibi et al 2015 over the last few decades analytical hierarchy process ahp is the most common and well known gis based method for hydrogeological studies pourghasemi et al 2012 kaliraj et al 2013 althuwaynee et al 2014 gangadharan et al 2016 the ahp was initially proposed by saaty 1987 and it has gained high popularity for its ease in obtaining the weights and its capacity to integrate heterogeneous data for the decision making process this approach helps planners and decision makers in utilizing their logical experience and information to separate an issue and resolve chan and kumar 2007 the ahp has been successfully applied in several arenas of studies including nature economy and society lee et al 2008 schmit et al 2015 rekha et al 2015 the usefulness of integrating ahp with rs and gis in assessing the groundwater potential zone has been attempted by many researchers hajkowicz and higgins 2008 machiwal et al 2011 jenifer and jha 2017 at different places viz timor leste pinto et al 2017 turkey recep 2019 nigeria adeyeye et al 2019 sri lanka kumar et al 2016 india arulbalaji et al 2019 andualem and demeke 2019 have given an ample review of the application of ahp gis and rs in groundwater potential zone in ethiopia for validating the predicted groundwater potential zone two dimensional electrical resistivity imaging 2d eri techniques have been applied successfully for groundwater exploration and other environmental studies in different parts of the world singh et al 2006 naudet et al 2014 aluko et al 2017 traditionally one dimensional 1d vertical electrical soundings ves method is the most commonly utilized technique because of its user friendliness low cost as well as the availability of interpretational aids kaya et al 2015 but 1d resistivity survey is laborious time consuming and does not account for the lateral variation in hydrologic properties of the aquifer units aluko et al 2017 addressing these issues the recent development of 2d eri techniques provides an excellent view of resistivity distribution of the rocks in the depth and lateral axes thus allowing reliable evaluation of the hydrogeological units in the subsurface beneath corriols et al 2009 therefore 2d eri technique is the most suitable method among all the geophysical methods for the delineation of an aquifer in complex and hard rocks terrains however this research paper aims to investigate groundwater potential zone by integrating rs gis and ahp method in amalgamation of 2d eri technique additionally in the study area no previous studies were conducted to find out the groundwater potential zone hence this research work highlights some of the possibilities inherent in the application of groundwater studies 2 study area the present study was conducted in the southern part of ethiopia which covers four districts namely bule hora dugda dawa melka soda and kercha with a total area of 7314 km2 the geographic extension of the study area is 5 30 0 n to 6 10 0 n latitude and 37 30 0 e to 38 60 0 e longitude respectively fig 1 the study area is underlined by hard rock terrain and it is located in the semi arid climatic zone average annual rain fall ranges between 350 mm and 900 mm rainfall in the area is bimodal with 60 occurrence of the long rainy season between april and may short rainy season from september to november long dry season from december to february and a short dry season from june to august gse 2015 the average annual temperature ranges from 19 c to 26 c the tectonic activity and lithological variation in the area partly or wholly control the drainage density and drainage pattern most of the river channels follow the rift valley structure and young lineaments the principal river basins and sub basins of the area are the genale mormora awate and dawa in the eastern highlands 3 material and methods this research work has been carried out in gis and rs platform through a knowledge based factor analysis using lithology soil texture drainage density slope geomorphology lineament density and land use land cover for the identification of groundwater potential zone overall methodological framework and data analysis are illustrated in fig 2 3 1 development of thematic layer the lithology and soil map were collected and digitized from published report of gse 2015 with the scale of 1 250 000 the lithology setup of an area influences the water holding capacity of the aquifer and directly affects the occurrence and distribution of groundwater krishnamurthy and srinivas 1995 similarly the soil texture has a significant role in the rate of infiltration based on topography hydro meteorological and lithological conditions pankaj et al 2016 the drainage density map of the study area was digitized from the survey of ethiopia toposheet of 1 50 000 scale drainage density helps to assess and understand the characteristics of runoff and groundwater infiltration in the area it also provides an inverse relation with the permeability of aquifers and plays a vital role in the run off distribution singh et al 2014 based on hammouri et al 2012 the drainage density map is categorized into three classes using equal interval classification at the line density tool in arcgis geomorphology lineament density and land use land cover were prepared by visually identifying the texture pattern association and the spectral signatures of different surface features on the landsat8 satellite image of 2016 and slope map was extracted from shuttle radar topography mission srtm data which was freely downloaded from usgs website and it was geometrically and radiometrically corrected in eradas imagine 8 6 respectively during the interpretation wherever the doubtful units are encountered the ground truth survey was under taken to verify the same principle of geomorphology provides information which is a value in predicting the geometry of aquifers on the weathering and erosion many geological formations develop landforms that are distinctive concerning slope continuity of outcrops murasingh et al 2018 soumen 2014 also indicated that alluvial plain and plateau have more impact on the occurrence of groundwater while the mountainous and residual hilly areas have shown less impact on controlling groundwater lineaments are the linear rectilinear curvilinear features of tectonic origin accompanied by the cranny and these provide space for the occurrence of groundwater nag and sumana 2014 the linear structures are extracted from the satellite image based on the discontinuity of the tonal textural soil relief and vegetation linearity curvilinear and drainage from the surrounding areas as per ferozur et al 2019 lineament density map is classified into three classes using an equal interval classification in arcgis the land use land cover surveys and mapping influences the various hydrological phenomena such as interception infiltration evaporation and surface flow elamhdy and mohamed 2016 the slope is an important indicator which determines the groundwater recharge capability gnanachandrasamy et al 2018 in the gentle slope area the surface runoff is slow thus allows more time for rainwater to percolate whereas higher slope results in rapid runoff and less recharge abdalla 2012 all the above mentioned thematic layers were geo referenced by the universal transverse mercator utm 37n projection with the datum of world geodetic system wgs 1984 individually each thematic layer was converted into a raster format with 30m spatial resolution in a gis environment 3 2 assignment of weightage based on ahp model gis based ahp method is the well known technique for delineating groundwater potential zones hammouri et al 2012 singh et al 2013 2018 fashae et al 2014 sahoo et al 2015 ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 pinto et al 2017 all factors do not have the same importance for the determination of groundwater potential zone therefore different weights were identified for different thematic layers weights of seven thematic layers and their classes have been assigned based on literature review and field knowledge of expert s opinion yeh et al 2016 al abadi 2017 patra et al 2018 das 2019 each thematic and sub thematic layer has been calculated using saaty s analytical hierarchy process saaty 1987 the saaty s scale 1 9 of relative importance value reveals that value of 9 indicates extreme importance 8 very strong 7 too extreme importance 6 strong plus 5 strong importance 4 moderate plus 3 moderate importance 2 weak and 1 equal importance as developed by saaty and vargas 2000 the consistency ratio is suggesting that if cr 0 1 the ratio would indicate a reasonable level while cr 0 1 it indicates inconsistent judgments gangadharan et al 2016 integration of these factors with their potential weights is computed through weighted overlay analysis in arc gis moreover the reclassification has been done in gis environment after assigning all the normalised weights and later on the groundwater potential map has been generated through eq 1 1 gwp ltw ltw i ldw ldw i slw slw i gtw gtw i ddw

weight of a theme wi normalised weight of individual features of a theme after assigning the weightage values for each of these parameters the study area has been classified into low moderate and high potential zones 3 3 validation and accuracy assessment validation is nothing but a comparison between ground truths data with the existing results pradhan 2013 the important part of groundwater potential zone is to investigate the accuracy assessment and validating the results using existing borehole yield data and 2d eri the existing borehole yield data was collected from the gse 2015 and it was overlaid with the groundwater potential zone in the arcgis environment the 2d eri method is a powerful technique to investigate subsurface electrical structures in various environments generally in the subsurface soil and rocks comprised of mineral grains are fundamentally nonconductive except in some exotic materials such as metallic ores so the resistivity of soils and rocks is controlled generally by the volume of pore water its resistivity and the package of the pores the range that differs in lithology is followed by differences of resistivity azhar et al 2016 resistivity surveys can be useful in finding bodies of anomalous materials or in evaluating the depths of bedrock surfaces abidin et al 2014 in the early 1990s the electrical resistivity method was mainly used in resistivity sounding profiling and mapping surveys sirhan and hamidi 2016 quantitative interpretation was mainly confined to 1 d one dimensional structure of the subsurface consisting of horizontal layers mohammed et al 2009 the multi electrode systems made it practical to carry out 2d eri surveys that give a more accurate picture of the subsurface routinely saad et al 2011 therefore the 2d eri can provide the information about the lateral variation of geological formation presence or absence of fractured zone and the potential groundwater zone aluko et al 2017 kaya et al 2015 the data from these surveys are commonly arranged and contoured in the form of a pseudosection which gives an appropriate picture of the subsurface resistivity loke et al 2003 for 2d eri iris syscal junior instrument was used in high potential zone this instrument was used in such a way that 72 switch electrodes were spaced at a 10m interval from each other in which wenner array configurations were used electrical resistivity is a bulky device used to inhibit the flow of electrical injection current the current between a pair of surface electrodes a and b flows into the ground and next pair of an electrode m and n were used to measure the resulting potential on other electrodes by using current i the potential value was measured in unit voltage v k is a geometric factor dependent on the electrode spacing it is defined by eq 2 2 ρ a k v i thus the resistivity has been interpreted as the ability of rock soil or groundwater to resist the flow of an electrical current the increase in electrode spacing will cause the penetration deeper resistivity contrast could occur in the subsurface between different layers such as dry and water bearing sediments or different lithology and different weathering layers from this method the reading acquired is apparent resistivity and it is inverted to obtain true electrical resistivity distribution of the study area using inversion rse2dinv software based on smoothness constrained least squares inversion by quasi newton optimisation method gupta et al 2014 based on the nature of ground gradient repeated surveys with different arrays have been performed and the array with the lowest root mean square rms has been considered for final assessment and thus the electrical properties of the area the associated imprints of groundwater zones were determined 4 result and discussion 4 1 criteria used in gis ahp the multi influencing factors for groundwater potential zones namely lithology soil texture drainage density slope geomorphology lineament density and land use land cover were analysed in arc gis software using ahp weightage method the results obtained on various thematic layers and geophysical properties are discussed below 4 1 1 lithological setup the study area consists of eight different types of lithological features mainly igneous and metamorphic rocks are shown in table 1 and fig 3 namely a sand silt and beach sand ssb are formed in quaternary sediments which covers the south western side of study area b early proterozoic age of wadera formation are meta sandstone quartzite biotite and muscovite schist mqbm are found in eastern part of the study area c quartz feldsphatic gneiss and granulite qfg are formed in yabello formation archean age which are covered in south western and eastern side of the area d alghe formation of archean group are biotite schist gneissis marble and graphite schist bgmg are covered by eastern side of the study area e biotite sillimanite garnet feldaphatic gneiss and marble bsgf are formed in archean age that lies in south western and few parts of north eastern side in study area f formation of jimma volcanic in late eocene age belongs to flood basalt with minor salic fbs flows are covered in few parts of north western side of the study area g teltele and surma basalt formation of middle miocene group are flood basalt fb which lies in north western and south western side of study area h diorite d is the dominated rock formed in central part of study area which belongs to precambrian group sub criteria weightage for ssb mqbm qfg bgmg bsgf fbs fb and d are 0 238 0 194 0 143 0 144 0 143 0 064 0 050 and 0 023 respectively thus the sub criteria is eight and the consistency ratio 0 079 is lesser than 0 1 indicating perfect comparison 4 1 2 lineament density according to andualem and demeke 2019 lineament density is directly proportional to groundwater potential so based on the density of lineaments the area is categorized into high 0 23 0 34 km km2 moderate 0 11 0 23 km km2 and low density 0 00 0 11 km km2 as shown in table 1 and fig 4 areas having high lineament density were considered as excellent groundwater prospect zone covering about 2 46 of the landscape criterion weightages are 0 686 0 235 and 0 079 for three sub criteria of high moderate and low density the consistency ratio is 0 041 0 1 which indicates a reasonable value 4 1 3 geomorphology geomorphological map help to identify the scope of groundwater occurrence in each unit and vary greatly depending upon the terrain evaluation land resource mapping and soil classification murasingh et al 2018 geomorphological map table 1 and fig 5 was classified into eight layers such as plain plateau valley escarpment high gradient hill high gradient mountain medium gradient hill and medium gradient mountain the major parts of the landscape are covered with plain and high gradient hill which are manifested by hill uplands and undulating surface the weightage for the geomorphology units is 0 225 0 196 0 147 0 145 0 146 0 065 0 054 and 0 022 for the valley escarpment plain plateau medium gradient mountain high gradient mountain medium gradient hill and high gradient hill respectively the consistency ratio was 0 081 0 1 the ratio indicating that the comparison was perfectly consistent 4 1 4 slope criterion weightage for slope are 0 377 0 258 0 204 0 126 and 0 035 for five sub criteria of nearly level gently slope moderately slope strongly sloping and very steep sloping table 1 and fig 6 the consistency ratio 0 068 is lesser than 0 1 indicating perfect comparison nearly level is considered as a good potential and highest ranking was assigned to it strongly sloping and very steep slope having high surface runoff are considered as poor groundwater potential assigned with the lowest ranking 4 1 5 land use land cover the rate of infiltration is directly proportional to the density of vegetation cover i e if the surface is covered by dense forest the infiltration will be more and the runoff will be less prabhakar and tiwari 2015 the major land use land cover patterns in the study area are forest cover grassland vegetation barren land water and settlements table 1 and fig 7 the major parts of the landscape were dominated by barren land followed by vegetation covering about 52 17 and 23 46 of the study area respectively the consistency ratio 0 006 is lesser than 0 1 indicating a reasonable value more weightage is given for forest cover and weightage for each criterion was 0 501 0 249 0 143 0 036 0 026 and 0 045 for forest cover water vegetation grassland barren land and settlements respectively 4 1 6 drainage density in study area the dendritic pattern is observed in the massive igneous rocks complex metamorphosed rocks of the shear zone and volcanic hills groundwater potential is found to be poor in very high drainage density areas as a major part of the water poured over them during rainfall is lost as surface runoff with little infiltration to meet groundwater on the contrary low drainage density areas permit more infiltration and recharge to the groundwater and therefore have more potential for groundwater occurrence singh et al 2014 since the drainage density can indirectly indicate the groundwater potential of an area due to its relation to surface run off and permeability it was considered as one of the indicators of groundwater occurrence generally study area categorized by high 0 27 0 41 km km2 moderate 0 14 0 27 km km2 and low density 0 00 0 14 km km2 table 1 and fig 8 about 45 6 and 36 8 of the area were found in low and moderate drainage density classes respectively the consistency ratio was 0 052 0 1 indicating a reasonable value criterion weightages for the three sub criteria were 0 556 0 354 and 0 090 for low moderate and high respectively 4 1 7 soil three types of soil table 1 and fig 9 were identified as per the gse 2015 and classified as loam sandy loam and clay the sandy loam soil is highly permeable lightly textured well drained and rate of infiltration is excellent mehra and singh 2018 so highest value is considered for sandy loam soil and these soils are found in south western and eastern side of the area the weightage given for sandy loam soil is 0 604 followed by loam weightage 0 326 and thereafter for a clay weightage 0 070 the sub criteria consistency ratio was 0 005 1 indicating perfect comparison 4 2 demarcation of groundwater potential zone based on parameters discussed above all the main seven thematic layers are assigned the cumulative weight using the weighted overlay techniques in spatial analysis tool of the idw method ahp weighted parameters has produced a suitable groundwater potential zone map in raster format using the raster calculator module in a gis environment avtar et al 2010 preeja et al 2011 the pairwise comparison matrix and relative importance of each criterion derived are shown in table 2 the criterion weights obtained are 0 264 0 200 0 165 0 137 0 118 0 074 and 0 041 for lithology lineament density soil texture geomorphology slope drainage density land use land cover and soil respectively the consistency ratio is 0 034 0 1 indicating a reasonable value according to the results of groundwater potential map fig 10 the study area is categorized into three different zones namely low moderate and high potential zone the result reveals that majority of the area was identified as low potential zone 4883 61 km2 followed by moderate 1314 79 km2 which is characterised by plateau high gradient hill low lineament density and high drainage density which facilitate high run off an area with high potential zones 247 69 km2 of groundwater occurred in small patches of the central south western and eastern part of the study area porous geological setting escarpment due to the presence of highly weathered fractured rocks permeable soil texture coupled with higher lineament density and vegetative cover helps in the development of the high potential zone 4 3 ground truth verification the results obtained using overlay analysis were subsequently cross checked with the existing borehole yield data and 2d eri totally 14 borehole data fig 11 were collected and analysed in the gis environment according to biswajit et al 2018 yield less than 0 5 l s is considered as poor whereas between 0 5 and 5 l s will be considered as adequate and greater than 5 l s are excellent for groundwater in hard rock terrain hence as per the borehole yield data in the study area 5 borehole samples belongs to greater than 5 l s in that 4 samples placed in high potential zone data ranging from 0 5 to 5 l s are exemplified by 5 samples and these were located in a moderate zone followed by 5 samples in a low potential zone ranging from 0 05 to 0 5 l s respectively generally the evaluation of the borehole data shows that the study area belongs to moderate to high yield an area with high yields is cited in the northern and south western portions of the study area as correlated with the high potential zone eri is an advanced geophysics method used to determine the subsurface resistivity distribution by making measurements on the ground surface in groundwater exploration low resistivity i e high conductivity is often diagnosed of water saturated rocks while high resistivity i e low conductivity can be interpreted as the absence of water saturated rocks seidu et al 2019 since 2d eri is a costly and time consuming technique therefore it was carried out only within the high potential area the results show three distinct images for each profile the upper image labelled a is a plot of the measured apparent resistivity pseudosection the middle image labelled b is the calculated apparent resistivity pseudosection and the lower image labelled c is the true resistivity model obtained after a definite number of iterations of the inversion program total average of rms error is 1 9 which indicates that good fits between the measured observed and calculated apparent resistivity data were achieved as per adeeko and muztaza 2018 resistivity ranges from 30 ωm to 150 ωm is considered as the water bearing zone in hard rock terrain area as shown in fig 11 the subsurface homogeneous resistivity distribution and the resistivity range from 6 84 ωm to 162 ωm respectively the resistivity value is divided into two layers first layer is grouped as low resistivity layer for which resistivity values ranges from 6 84 ωm to 30 ωm till the depth of 20m for the resistivity of second layer which ranges from 30 ωm to 162 ωm respectively and these resistivity sections are extending from 20m to more than 86m depth in general the first layer representing the top layer which is covered by soil has not shown variation of geoelectrical response due to the soil condition and its nature the subsequent second layer thickness and resistivity values invariably indicate weathered and fractured formation where the probability of occurrence of groundwater is significant in general the freshwater bearing zone is encountered in hard rock terrain observed with a resistivity value range of 30 150 ωm adeeko and muztaza 2018 therefore the second layer observed at the depth of 20m 86m with resistivity value of 30 ωm to 150 ωm respectively has favourable aquifer conditions and is considered as a groundwater potential zone such promising zones were observed almost in the entire part of the subsurface it normally represents the weathered and fractured zone which is considered as the auspicious zone for groundwater occurrences kumar et al 2016 5 conclusions in this research mapping of groundwater potential zones using a combination of gis rs ahp and 2d eri techniques plays an important role in assessing the groundwater resource these techniques are more accurate and found efficient in minimizing time workforce cost and thereby making a quick decision for identifying sustainable groundwater resources the lithology of the study area mainly consists of diorite and flood basalt which has both primary and secondary porosity due to the presence of texture structure and the thickness of the water bearing layers drainage density lineament density slope geomorphology and land use land cover are the surface manifestations of subsurface geology interpreted from satellite data and it is also effectively utilized for demarcation of favourable groundwater zones integrating all thematic layers in a gis environment using ahp weighted overlay analysis reveal that the study area is categorized into three groundwater potential zones namely low moderate and high the results indicated that high potential zone fall in 247 69 km2 and they are mainly located in downstream of south western parts of the escarpment region in these areas the slope is moderate with low drainage density that leads to high infiltration rate and also the soil is loamy that can hold a high amount of water a low potential zone is indicative of the least favourable for groundwater potential and it is covered by 4883 61 km2 followed by moderate zone fall in 1314 79 km2 overall it is observed that the geomorphic units and lithology have a major bearing on the groundwater region while the lineament density controls groundwater flow in the study area for ground truth verification these results were compared with groundwater yield data which shows a positive correlation between potential zones however the majority of 5 l s groundwater yield samples are falling under the high potential zone 2d eri were conducted in high potential zone which clearly shows that majority of the area is covered by water bearing formation extending from 20m to more than 86m depth with resistivity values of 30 ωm to 162 ωm respectively therefore this methodology is very useful in designing appropriate policies towards judicious use and extraction of groundwater resources declaration of competing interest there is no conflict of interest between authors acknowledgments we express our sincere thanks to dr chala wata

12054,pressure on groundwater resources is continuously increasing day by day in west guji zone southern ethiopia due to urbanization so this research introduces the integration of various methods like geographical information system gis remote sensing rs analytical hierarchy process ahp and two dimensional electrical resistivity imaging 2d eri technique for assessing the accurate and reliable sources of groundwater in the study area to delineate groundwater potentiality seven main criteria like lithology drainage density lineament density soil texture geomorphology slope and land use cover were identified based on the regional characteristics field surveys local information and literature review weightage for each thematic layer was consequently done by gis based ahp weighted overlay analysis techniques and classified into three categories which represent high 247 69 km2 moderate 1314 79 km2 and low 4883 61 km2 respectively high potential zones are mainly found in escarpment areas due to the presence of highly weathered and fractured rocks at last results were validated with borehole yield data and 2d eri survey the coordinates of each borehole yield data have been transferred to gis platforms and it clearly shows that 4 out of 5 sample points were matching with 5 l s in high potential zones 2d eri was conducted in the high potential zone for cross validating the results and it indicates that the area was covered by water bearing formation with resistivity values of 30 ωm to 162 ωm respectively therefore these tools are very effective for groundwater sustainable development and indispensable for planning and utilization of groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords borehole yield data two dimensional electrical resistivity imaging geographical information system remote sensing analytical hierarchy process 1 introduction groundwater represents the second most abundantly available freshwater resources in the entire world and it is governed by factors like availability accessibility transportability and cost effectiveness shrestha et al 2016 the quantity of groundwater recovered from an aquifer system is important especially for domestic irrigation and industrial sectors nowadays groundwater exploring and exploiting are carried out without taking cognizance of the different subsurface units that could assist in the proper delineation of productive aquifer units falowo et al 2017 this consequently leads to abortive bore holes low yield wells total failure of wells and adulterated water therefore sustainable use of groundwater resource is highly expedient to prevent a decrease in water tables level environmental degradation rising pumping costs of wells and reduction of yield in a country like ethiopia people often face acute water scarcity due to rapid population growth and monsoon failure as results of this surface water is not available round the year for meeting different purposes and hence people in such areas have to depend more on groundwater resources for their survival unesco 2004 ahmad et al 2019 hence it requires the preparation of suitable plans for efficient groundwater management groundwater is the most precious resource and is limited in nature which cannot be detected easily haque et al 2020 identification of groundwater resources in hard rock terrain is a complex task because of variations in weathering and fracture zones that vary from place to place under the influence of different hydrological settings suhag 2016 rahmati et al 2015 the conventional and reliable methods like drilling test and stratigraphy analysis used to locate groundwater in hard rock terrains are very much expensive and time consuming gopinathan et al 2020 presently geographical information system gis and remote sensing rs with electrical resistivity techniques are reliable cost effective and time saving tools for locating groundwater potential zones by integrating various parameters like lithology slope soil texture drainage density geomorphology lineament density land use land cover and the interrelationship between these factors jha et al 2010 yousef ali et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 nair et al 2017 rajaveni et al 2017 chaudhary and sanjeev 2018 gis and rs are widely used to derive considerably accurate results for aquifer studies which assist in assessing monitoring and conserving groundwater resources many of the previous studies have utilized the gis and rs technology in groundwater related studies das et al 1997 vasanthavigar et al 2012 singh et al 2013 politi et al 2016 gangadharan and nila rekha 2019 and it helps a lot in improving the ability to locate groundwater potential zones in hard rock terrains saraf and choudhary 1998 pratap et al 2000 srinivasa rao and jugran 2003 kumar et al 2008 oh and lee 2011 naghibi et al 2015 over the last few decades analytical hierarchy process ahp is the most common and well known gis based method for hydrogeological studies pourghasemi et al 2012 kaliraj et al 2013 althuwaynee et al 2014 gangadharan et al 2016 the ahp was initially proposed by saaty 1987 and it has gained high popularity for its ease in obtaining the weights and its capacity to integrate heterogeneous data for the decision making process this approach helps planners and decision makers in utilizing their logical experience and information to separate an issue and resolve chan and kumar 2007 the ahp has been successfully applied in several arenas of studies including nature economy and society lee et al 2008 schmit et al 2015 rekha et al 2015 the usefulness of integrating ahp with rs and gis in assessing the groundwater potential zone has been attempted by many researchers hajkowicz and higgins 2008 machiwal et al 2011 jenifer and jha 2017 at different places viz timor leste pinto et al 2017 turkey recep 2019 nigeria adeyeye et al 2019 sri lanka kumar et al 2016 india arulbalaji et al 2019 andualem and demeke 2019 have given an ample review of the application of ahp gis and rs in groundwater potential zone in ethiopia for validating the predicted groundwater potential zone two dimensional electrical resistivity imaging 2d eri techniques have been applied successfully for groundwater exploration and other environmental studies in different parts of the world singh et al 2006 naudet et al 2014 aluko et al 2017 traditionally one dimensional 1d vertical electrical soundings ves method is the most commonly utilized technique because of its user friendliness low cost as well as the availability of interpretational aids kaya et al 2015 but 1d resistivity survey is laborious time consuming and does not account for the lateral variation in hydrologic properties of the aquifer units aluko et al 2017 addressing these issues the recent development of 2d eri techniques provides an excellent view of resistivity distribution of the rocks in the depth and lateral axes thus allowing reliable evaluation of the hydrogeological units in the subsurface beneath corriols et al 2009 therefore 2d eri technique is the most suitable method among all the geophysical methods for the delineation of an aquifer in complex and hard rocks terrains however this research paper aims to investigate groundwater potential zone by integrating rs gis and ahp method in amalgamation of 2d eri technique additionally in the study area no previous studies were conducted to find out the groundwater potential zone hence this research work highlights some of the possibilities inherent in the application of groundwater studies 2 study area the present study was conducted in the southern part of ethiopia which covers four districts namely bule hora dugda dawa melka soda and kercha with a total area of 7314 km2 the geographic extension of the study area is 5 30 0 n to 6 10 0 n latitude and 37 30 0 e to 38 60 0 e longitude respectively fig 1 the study area is underlined by hard rock terrain and it is located in the semi arid climatic zone average annual rain fall ranges between 350 mm and 900 mm rainfall in the area is bimodal with 60 occurrence of the long rainy season between april and may short rainy season from september to november long dry season from december to february and a short dry season from june to august gse 2015 the average annual temperature ranges from 19 c to 26 c the tectonic activity and lithological variation in the area partly or wholly control the drainage density and drainage pattern most of the river channels follow the rift valley structure and young lineaments the principal river basins and sub basins of the area are the genale mormora awate and dawa in the eastern highlands 3 material and methods this research work has been carried out in gis and rs platform through a knowledge based factor analysis using lithology soil texture drainage density slope geomorphology lineament density and land use land cover for the identification of groundwater potential zone overall methodological framework and data analysis are illustrated in fig 2 3 1 development of thematic layer the lithology and soil map were collected and digitized from published report of gse 2015 with the scale of 1 250 000 the lithology setup of an area influences the water holding capacity of the aquifer and directly affects the occurrence and distribution of groundwater krishnamurthy and srinivas 1995 similarly the soil texture has a significant role in the rate of infiltration based on topography hydro meteorological and lithological conditions pankaj et al 2016 the drainage density map of the study area was digitized from the survey of ethiopia toposheet of 1 50 000 scale drainage density helps to assess and understand the characteristics of runoff and groundwater infiltration in the area it also provides an inverse relation with the permeability of aquifers and plays a vital role in the run off distribution singh et al 2014 based on hammouri et al 2012 the drainage density map is categorized into three classes using equal interval classification at the line density tool in arcgis geomorphology lineament density and land use land cover were prepared by visually identifying the texture pattern association and the spectral signatures of different surface features on the landsat8 satellite image of 2016 and slope map was extracted from shuttle radar topography mission srtm data which was freely downloaded from usgs website and it was geometrically and radiometrically corrected in eradas imagine 8 6 respectively during the interpretation wherever the doubtful units are encountered the ground truth survey was under taken to verify the same principle of geomorphology provides information which is a value in predicting the geometry of aquifers on the weathering and erosion many geological formations develop landforms that are distinctive concerning slope continuity of outcrops murasingh et al 2018 soumen 2014 also indicated that alluvial plain and plateau have more impact on the occurrence of groundwater while the mountainous and residual hilly areas have shown less impact on controlling groundwater lineaments are the linear rectilinear curvilinear features of tectonic origin accompanied by the cranny and these provide space for the occurrence of groundwater nag and sumana 2014 the linear structures are extracted from the satellite image based on the discontinuity of the tonal textural soil relief and vegetation linearity curvilinear and drainage from the surrounding areas as per ferozur et al 2019 lineament density map is classified into three classes using an equal interval classification in arcgis the land use land cover surveys and mapping influences the various hydrological phenomena such as interception infiltration evaporation and surface flow elamhdy and mohamed 2016 the slope is an important indicator which determines the groundwater recharge capability gnanachandrasamy et al 2018 in the gentle slope area the surface runoff is slow thus allows more time for rainwater to percolate whereas higher slope results in rapid runoff and less recharge abdalla 2012 all the above mentioned thematic layers were geo referenced by the universal transverse mercator utm 37n projection with the datum of world geodetic system wgs 1984 individually each thematic layer was converted into a raster format with 30m spatial resolution in a gis environment 3 2 assignment of weightage based on ahp model gis based ahp method is the well known technique for delineating groundwater potential zones hammouri et al 2012 singh et al 2013 2018 fashae et al 2014 sahoo et al 2015 ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 pinto et al 2017 all factors do not have the same importance for the determination of groundwater potential zone therefore different weights were identified for different thematic layers weights of seven thematic layers and their classes have been assigned based on literature review and field knowledge of expert s opinion yeh et al 2016 al abadi 2017 patra et al 2018 das 2019 each thematic and sub thematic layer has been calculated using saaty s analytical hierarchy process saaty 1987 the saaty s scale 1 9 of relative importance value reveals that value of 9 indicates extreme importance 8 very strong 7 too extreme importance 6 strong plus 5 strong importance 4 moderate plus 3 moderate importance 2 weak and 1 equal importance as developed by saaty and vargas 2000 the consistency ratio is suggesting that if cr 0 1 the ratio would indicate a reasonable level while cr 0 1 it indicates inconsistent judgments gangadharan et al 2016 integration of these factors with their potential weights is computed through weighted overlay analysis in arc gis moreover the reclassification has been done in gis environment after assigning all the normalised weights and later on the groundwater potential map has been generated through eq 1 1 gwp ltw ltw i ldw ldw i slw slw i gtw gtw i ddw

potential zones 3 3 validation and accuracy assessment validation is nothing but a comparison between ground truths data with the existing results pradhan 2013 the important part of groundwater potential zone is to investigate the accuracy assessment and validating the results using existing borehole yield data and 2d eri the existing borehole yield data was collected from the gse 2015 and it was overlaid with the groundwater potential zone in the arcgis environment the 2d eri method is a powerful technique to investigate subsurface electrical structures in various environments generally in the subsurface soil and rocks comprised of mineral grains are fundamentally nonconductive except in some exotic materials such as metallic ores so the resistivity of soils and rocks is controlled generally by the volume of pore water its resistivity and the package of the pores the range that differs in lithology is followed by differences of resistivity azhar et al 2016 resistivity surveys can be useful in finding bodies of anomalous materials or in evaluating the depths of bedrock surfaces abidin et al 2014 in the early 1990s the electrical resistivity method was mainly used in resistivity sounding profiling and mapping surveys sirhan and hamidi 2016 quantitative interpretation was mainly confined to 1 d one dimensional structure of the subsurface consisting of horizontal layers mohammed et al 2009 the multi electrode systems made it practical to carry out 2d eri surveys that give a more accurate picture of the subsurface routinely saad et al 2011 therefore the 2d eri can provide the information about the lateral variation of geological formation presence or absence of fractured zone and the potential groundwater zone aluko et al 2017 kaya et al 2015 the data from these surveys are commonly arranged and contoured in the form of a pseudosection which gives an appropriate picture of the subsurface resistivity loke et al 2003 for 2d eri iris syscal junior instrument was used in high potential zone this instrument was used in such a way that 72 switch electrodes were spaced at a 10m interval from each other in which wenner array configurations were used electrical resistivity is a bulky device used to inhibit the flow of electrical injection current the current between a pair of surface electrodes a and b flows into the ground and next pair of an electrode m and n were used to measure the resulting potential on other electrodes by using current i the potential value was measured in unit voltage v k is a geometric factor dependent on the electrode spacing it is defined by eq 2 2 ρ a k v i thus the resistivity has been interpreted as the ability of rock soil or groundwater to resist the flow of an electrical current the increase in electrode spacing will cause the penetration deeper resistivity contrast could occur in the subsurface between different layers such as dry and water bearing sediments or different lithology and different weathering layers from this method the reading acquired is apparent resistivity and it is inverted to obtain true electrical resistivity distribution of the study area using inversion rse2dinv software based on smoothness constrained least squares inversion by quasi newton optimisation method gupta et al 2014 based on the nature of ground gradient repeated surveys with different arrays have been performed and the array with the lowest root mean square rms has been considered for final assessment and thus the electrical properties of the area the associated imprints of groundwater zones were determined 4 result and discussion 4 1 criteria used in gis ahp the multi influencing factors for groundwater potential zones namely lithology soil texture drainage density slope geomorphology lineament density and land use land cover were analysed in arc gis software using ahp weightage method the results obtained on various thematic layers and geophysical properties are discussed below 4 1 1 lithological setup the study area consists of eight different types of lithological features mainly igneous and metamorphic rocks are shown in table 1 and fig 3 namely a sand silt and beach sand ssb are formed in quaternary sediments which covers the south western side of study area b early proterozoic age of wadera formation are meta sandstone quartzite biotite and muscovite schist mqbm are found in eastern part of the study area c quartz feldsphatic gneiss and granulite qfg are formed in yabello formation archean age which are covered in south western and eastern side of the area d alghe formation of archean group are biotite schist gneissis marble and graphite schist bgmg are covered by eastern side of the study area e biotite sillimanite garnet feldaphatic gneiss and marble bsgf are formed in archean age that lies in south western and few parts of north eastern side in study area f formation of jimma volcanic in late eocene age belongs to flood basalt with minor salic fbs flows are covered in few parts of north western side of the study area g teltele and surma basalt formation of middle miocene group are flood basalt fb which lies in north western and south western side of study area h diorite d is the dominated rock formed in central part of study area which belongs to precambrian group sub criteria weightage for ssb mqbm qfg bgmg bsgf fbs fb and d are 0 238 0 194 0 143 0 144 0 143 0 064 0 050 and 0 023 respectively thus the sub criteria is eight and the consistency ratio 0 079 is lesser than 0 1 indicating perfect comparison 4 1 2 lineament density according to andualem and demeke 2019 lineament density is directly proportional to groundwater potential so based on the density of lineaments the area is categorized into high 0 23 0 34 km km2 moderate 0 11 0 23 km km2 and low density 0 00 0 11 km km2 as shown in table 1 and fig 4 areas having high lineament density were considered as excellent groundwater prospect zone covering about 2 46 of the landscape criterion weightages are 0 686 0 235 and 0 079 for three sub criteria of high moderate and low density the consistency ratio is 0 041 0 1 which indicates a reasonable value 4 1 3 geomorphology geomorphological map help to identify the scope of groundwater occurrence in each unit and vary greatly depending upon the terrain evaluation land resource mapping and soil classification murasingh et al 2018 geomorphological map table 1 and fig 5 was classified into eight layers such as plain plateau valley escarpment high gradient hill high gradient mountain medium gradient hill and medium gradient mountain the major parts of the landscape are covered with plain and high gradient hill which are manifested by hill uplands and undulating surface the weightage for the geomorphology units is 0 225 0 196 0 147 0 145 0 146 0 065 0 054 and 0 022 for the valley escarpment plain plateau medium gradient mountain high gradient mountain medium gradient hill and high gradient hill respectively the consistency ratio was 0 081 0 1 the ratio indicating that the comparison was perfectly consistent 4 1 4 slope criterion weightage for slope are 0 377 0 258 0 204 0 126 and 0 035 for five sub criteria of nearly level gently slope moderately slope strongly sloping and very steep sloping table 1 and fig 6 the consistency ratio 0 068 is lesser than 0 1 indicating perfect comparison nearly level is considered as a good potential and highest ranking was assigned to it strongly sloping and very steep slope having high surface runoff are considered as poor groundwater potential assigned with the lowest ranking 4 1 5 land use land cover the rate of infiltration is directly proportional to the density of vegetation cover i e if the surface is covered by dense forest the infiltration will be more and the runoff will be less prabhakar and tiwari 2015 the major land use land cover patterns in the study area are forest cover grassland vegetation barren land water and settlements table 1 and fig 7 the major parts of the landscape were dominated by barren land followed by vegetation covering about 52 17 and 23 46 of the study area respectively the consistency ratio 0 006 is lesser than 0 1 indicating a reasonable value more weightage is given for forest cover and weightage for each criterion was 0 501 0 249 0 143 0 036 0 026 and 0 045 for forest cover water vegetation grassland barren land and settlements respectively 4 1 6 drainage density in study area the dendritic pattern is observed in the massive igneous rocks complex metamorphosed rocks of the shear zone and volcanic hills groundwater potential is found to be poor in very high drainage density areas as a major part of the water poured over them during rainfall is lost as surface runoff with little infiltration to meet groundwater on the contrary low drainage density areas permit more infiltration and recharge to the groundwater and therefore have more potential for groundwater occurrence singh et al 2014 since the drainage density can indirectly indicate the groundwater potential of an area due to its relation to surface run off and permeability it was considered as one of the indicators of groundwater occurrence generally study area categorized by high 0 27 0 41 km km2 moderate 0 14 0 27 km km2 and low density 0 00 0 14 km km2 table 1 and fig 8 about 45 6 and 36 8 of the area were found in low and moderate drainage density classes respectively the consistency ratio was 0 052 0 1 indicating a reasonable value criterion weightages for the three sub criteria were 0 556 0 354 and 0 090 for low moderate and high respectively 4 1 7 soil three types of soil table 1 and fig 9 were identified as per the gse 2015 and classified as loam sandy loam and clay the sandy loam soil is highly permeable lightly textured well drained and rate of infiltration is excellent mehra and singh 2018 so highest value is considered for sandy loam soil and these soils are found in south western and eastern side of the area the weightage given for sandy loam soil is 0 604 followed by loam weightage 0 326 and thereafter for a clay weightage 0 070 the sub criteria consistency ratio was 0 005 1 indicating perfect comparison 4 2 demarcation of groundwater potential zone based on parameters discussed above all the main seven thematic layers are assigned the cumulative weight using the weighted overlay techniques in spatial analysis tool of the idw method ahp weighted parameters has produced a suitable groundwater potential zone map in raster format using the raster calculator module in a gis environment avtar et al 2010 preeja et al 2011 the pairwise comparison matrix and relative importance of each criterion derived are shown in table 2 the criterion weights obtained are 0 264 0 200 0 165 0 137 0 118 0 074 and 0 041 for lithology lineament density soil texture geomorphology slope drainage density land use land cover and soil respectively the consistency ratio is 0 034 0 1 indicating a reasonable value according to the results of groundwater potential map fig 10 the study area is categorized into three different zones namely low moderate and high potential zone the result reveals that majority of the area was identified as low potential zone 4883 61 km2 followed by moderate 1314 79 km2 which is characterised by plateau high gradient hill low lineament density and high drainage density which facilitate high run off an area with high potential zones 247 69 km2 of groundwater occurred in small patches of the central south western and eastern part of the study area porous geological setting escarpment due to the presence of highly weathered fractured rocks permeable soil texture coupled with higher lineament density and vegetative cover helps in the development of the high potential zone 4 3 ground truth verification the results obtained using overlay analysis were subsequently cross checked with the existing borehole yield data and 2d eri totally 14 borehole data fig 11 were collected and analysed in the gis environment according to biswajit et al 2018 yield less than 0 5 l s is considered as poor whereas between 0 5 and 5 l s will be considered as adequate and greater than 5 l s are excellent for groundwater in hard rock terrain hence as per the borehole yield data in the study area 5 borehole samples belongs to greater than 5 l s in that 4 samples placed in high potential zone data ranging from 0 5 to 5 l s are exemplified by 5 samples and these were located in a moderate zone followed by 5 samples in a low potential zone ranging from 0 05 to 0 5 l s respectively generally the evaluation of the borehole data shows that the study area belongs to moderate to high yield an area with high yields is cited in the northern and south western portions of the study area as correlated with the high potential zone eri is an advanced geophysics method used to determine the subsurface resistivity distribution by making measurements on the ground surface in groundwater exploration low resistivity i e high conductivity is often diagnosed of water saturated rocks while high resistivity i e low conductivity can be interpreted as the absence of water saturated rocks seidu et al 2019 since 2d eri is a costly and time consuming technique therefore it was carried out only within the high potential area the results show three distinct images for each profile the upper image labelled a is a plot of the measured apparent resistivity pseudosection the middle image labelled b is the calculated apparent resistivity pseudosection and the lower image labelled c is the true resistivity model obtained after a definite number of iterations of the inversion program total average of rms error is 1 9 which indicates that good fits between the measured observed and calculated apparent resistivity data were achieved as per adeeko and muztaza 2018 resistivity ranges from 30 ωm to 150 ωm is considered as the water bearing zone in hard rock terrain area as shown in fig 11 the subsurface homogeneous resistivity distribution and the resistivity range from 6 84 ωm to 162 ωm respectively the resistivity value is divided into two layers first layer is grouped as low resistivity layer for which resistivity values ranges from 6 84 ωm to 30 ωm till the depth of 20m for the resistivity of second layer which ranges from 30 ωm to 162 ωm respectively and these resistivity sections are extending from 20m to more than 86m depth in general the first layer representing the top layer which is covered by soil has not shown variation of geoelectrical response due to the soil condition and its nature the subsequent second layer thickness and resistivity values invariably indicate weathered and fractured formation where the probability of occurrence of groundwater is significant in general the freshwater bearing zone is encountered in hard rock terrain observed with a resistivity value range of 30 150 ωm adeeko and muztaza 2018 therefore the second layer observed at the depth of 20m 86m with resistivity value of 30 ωm to 150 ωm respectively has favourable aquifer conditions and is considered as a groundwater potential zone such promising zones were observed almost in the entire part of the subsurface it normally represents the weathered and fractured zone which is considered as the auspicious zone for groundwater occurrences kumar et al 2016 5 conclusions in this research mapping of groundwater potential zones using a combination of gis rs ahp and 2d eri techniques plays an important role in assessing the groundwater resource these techniques are more accurate and found efficient in minimizing time workforce cost and thereby making a quick decision for identifying sustainable groundwater resources the lithology of the study area mainly consists of diorite and flood basalt which has both primary and secondary porosity due to the presence of texture structure and the thickness of the water bearing layers drainage density lineament density slope geomorphology and land use land cover are the surface manifestations of subsurface geology interpreted from satellite data and it is also effectively utilized for demarcation of favourable groundwater zones integrating all thematic layers in a gis environment using ahp weighted overlay analysis reveal that the study area is categorized into three groundwater potential zones namely low moderate and high the results indicated that high potential zone fall in 247 69 km2 and they are mainly located in downstream of south western parts of the escarpment region in these areas the slope is moderate with low drainage density that leads to high infiltration rate and also the soil is loamy that can hold a high amount of water a low potential zone is indicative of the least favourable for groundwater potential and it is covered by 4883 61 km2 followed by moderate zone fall in 1314 79 km2 overall it is observed that the geomorphic units and lithology have a major bearing on the groundwater region while the lineament density controls groundwater flow in the study area for ground truth verification these results were compared with groundwater yield data which shows a positive correlation between potential zones however the majority of 5 l s groundwater yield samples are falling under the high potential zone 2d eri were conducted in high potential zone which clearly shows that majority of the area is covered by water bearing formation extending from 20m to more than 86m depth with resistivity values of 30 ωm to 162 ωm respectively therefore this methodology is very useful in designing appropriate policies towards
