maritime transportation risk by combining geospatial techniques and multi criteria decision making fourteen criteria in three risk component categories hazard vulnerability and exposure and mitigation capacity were selected for use and converted into spatial layers using geospatial techniques risk component maps were created by weighting the indices according to a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process a risk map was then produced by integrating the hazard vulnerability and exposure and mitigation capacity risk component maps the south china sea was used to illustrate the proposed methodology the spatial variation of risk was characterized by identifying zones of risk i e very high high medium low and very low and the results were confirmed by historical accident data a sensitivity analysis was further conducted to examine the robustness of the results these findings may help related authorities to develop effective mitigation plans and strategies to improve navigation safety keywords maritime transportation spatial multi criteria approach risk assessment fuzzy analytical hierarchy process south china sea 1 introduction frequent sea trade has accelerated the development of the global economy approximately 90 of global trade is performed by maritime transportation due to its cost effectiveness baksh et al 2018 however with the rapid increase in the size and number of ships the possibility of maritime accidents is expected to grow knapp and heij 2017 størkersen et al 2017 the influences of such accidents could be high on the basis of loss of life and damage to property and marine environment heij et al 2011 zhou et al 2019 for example on january 6 2018 the sanchi tanker collided with the hong kong flagged cargo ship cf crystal and none of the 32 crew members survived ministry of transport of the people s republic of china 2018 ship navigation safety is thus a growing concern to maritime authorities the shipping industry and society and this growing concern reflects the importance of maritime traffic risk assessment huang et al 2019 a large number of studies on maritime transportation risk from qualitative assessments to quantitative evaluations have been undertaken globally commonly researches on maritime transportation risk evaluation are based on maritime reports and statistical approaches zhang et al 2019 for instance zhang et al 2013 evaluated the maritime transportation risk of the yangtze river waterway based on a bayesian network vander hoorn and knapp 2015 introduced a new multi layered approach to assess and predict maritime transportation risk abbassi et al 2017 developed a methodology based on the bow tie diagram for risk analysis this methodology is applicable to shipping in arctic waters chai et al 2017 proposed a quantitative risk evaluation technique to identify the possibility of ship collisions baksh et al 2018 presented a risk model to estimate the possibility of ship accidents along the northern sea route huang et al 2019 calculated the risk of grounding quantitatively by integrating crossing line and monte carlo approaches the approaches developed in these studies can be used to evaluate the long term risk situation of a ship however these approaches appear inadequate for presenting risk information spatially to address this issue wang et al 2014 applied a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method to analyze the spatial variation of shipping route risk zhang et al 2019 developed a navigation risk evaluation method based on gray relational theory to produce shipping risk maps although some progress in risk evaluation at spatial scales had been made most approaches use limited criteria in the evaluation process in particular there is no comprehensive analysis method available that specifically considers a range of maritime transportation risk drivers hazard vulnerability exposure and mitigation capacity in determining the overall navigation risk a sound understanding of risk drivers at large spatial scales is essential for the development of risk reduction measures and policy röthlisberger et al 2017 spatial analysis can be applied to mapping risks efficiently hoque et al 2019 although such methods are used in many applications they are not routinely applied in maritime transportation risk assessment vander hoorn and knapp 2015 obviously it is essential to develop a spatial approach for evaluating the risk of ships in the marine environment to fill this research gap a spatial fuzzy multi criteria evaluation approach for assessing and mapping maritime transportation risk is suggested in this paper in this study several spatial criterion layers in three risk component categories i e hazard vulnerability exposure and mitigation capacity were created using geospatial techniques thereafter risk component maps were generated by weighting the indices based on a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp a risk map that integrated hazard vulnerability and exposure and mitigation capacity was produced to quantify the overall spatial variation and degree of navigation risk historical accident data were used to verify the risk map and a sensitivity analysis was further conducted to examine the robustness of the results the south china sea scs was chosen as a study area to illustrate the approach the approach suggested here and the results of this study may help related authorities to develop effective mitigation plans and strategies to reduce navigation risk the novelty of the present study lies in the development of a new maritime transportation risk evaluation approach by combining geospatial techniques and multi criteria decision making first a more comprehensive criteria system for maritime transportation risk evaluation is established in this study then to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first attempt to assess maritime transportation risk by integrating geospatial techniques and multiple criteria decision making using a fahp technique more specifically the advantage of the proposed approach is that the uncertainty of experts opinions is reduced to a minimum by using the fahp technique in addition the application of the geospatial techniques provided by in built gis tools for map creation helps to reduce computational complexity although the south china sea has been used as the case study herein the methodology presented can be applied to evaluate maritime transportation risk in any sea area of the world the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the study area and the data used in this study in section 3 the methodological framework is introduced section 4 presents the results of the analysis and discussion in section 5 the conclusions are summarized and policy implications are presented 2 study area and datasets this study area we selected is the scs which is a large marginal sea the scs extends from 23 n to 3 s and from 102 e to 121 e fig 1 it covers an area of 3 5 10 6 km 2 and the average depth of the water is more than 2000 m lan et al 2013 zhou et al 2019 this region is one of the most heavily traveled ocean areas in the world and is bordered by china the philippines vietnam brunei singapore and malaysia and the main shipping lanes in these sea areas are shown in fig 1 the world factbook 2015 it is also known as a dangerous area due to shallow waters rocks typhoons pirates etc knapp and van de velden 2011 wang et al 2014 losses resulting from shipping accidents in the scs from 2006 to 2015 were the greatest compared with other regions around the world weng et al 2018 in this study the selected criteria were mapped using various data sources including governments international organizations and commercial companies some of the selected criteria are dynamic because their datasets are updated continuously such as low cloud cover 10 m wind speed significant wave height in this context these criteria were mapped by using an average of the data of various years thereby revealing a comprehensive characteristic among these criteria table 1 shows a list of the datasets used including data name source period and output the arcgis software v 10 3 was used to conduct spatial analysis and prepare spatial criterion layers 3 methods 3 1 overview in this study the risk is defined as the possibility of the occurrence of hazardous accidents or abnormal incidents during ship navigation at sea hu et al 2007 a well developed risk equation can give rise to better risk evaluation goerlandt and montewka 2015 hoque et al 2018 in general risk can be considered as a function of hazard vulnerability exposure and mitigation capacity and is calculated as follows hoque et al 2019 mansour 2019 sajjad and chan 2019 1 r i s k h a z a r d v u l n e r a b i l i t y e x p o s u r e m i t i g a t i o n c a p a c i t y this definition shows that increments in hazard vulnerability and exposure will lead to higher risk directly proportional but an increment in mitigation capacity will lead to lower risk inversely proportional to obtain the risk value the indices of the hazard vulnerability and exposure and mitigation capacity are first generated individually then according to equation 1 the risk value equals hazard index multiplies operator x vulnerability and exposure index and divided by mitigation capacity index operator in this study a spatial fuzzy multi criteria evaluation approach was developed for use as a foundation for calculating ship navigation risk the steps in this approach include identification quantification ranking weighting of the criteria and map generation a fahp technique which can incorporate and aggregate multiple criteria efficiently hoque et al 2019 li et al 2019 was used to weight the criteria then a hazard map vulnerability and exposure map and mitigation capacity map are generated respectively finally a risk map is created by incorporating three risk components fig 2 presents the methodological flowchart used in the proposed approach 3 2 criteria for hazard a hazard can be understood as a process or phenomenon that may result in loss of life damage to property environmental pollution and social disruption unisdr 2019 the first step in this study was to identify the natural and man made hazards that exist in the navigation environment various types of hazards threaten ship navigation on the sea following an extensive review of the ship navigation environment balmat et al 2009 mokhtari et al 2011 wang et al 2014 sahin and kum 2015 zhang et al 2016 khan et al 2018 tian et al 2018 eight criteria were selected for use table 2 1 water depth 2 typhoon pressure 3 typhoon frequency 4 gale frequency 5 big wave frequency 6 fog 7 precipitation and 8 piracy and armed robbery frequency water depth has a significant influence on ship navigation safety sea areas with low depth cause ship grounding the threshold for which was set to 20 m in this study wang et al 2014 huang et al 2019 water depth greater than 20 m was regarded as safe for ship navigation typhoons are considered to be among the deadliest climatic disasters posing great threat and harm to navigation safety and personal safety bakkensen and mendelsohn 2019 typhoon frequency and pressure influence the hazard intensity for a particular area nguyen et al 2019 in addition gales can cause ships to drift sideways thus to improve the width requirement for maneuvering briggs et al 2003 big waves mainly affect heave pitch and yaw briggs et al 2003 we defined a wind with a speed higher than 11 7 m s as a gale and any wave with a wave height of more than 6 m as a big wave wang et al 2014 to assess the influence of visibility on the ship navigation fog and precipitation should be considered systematically jiang et al 2016 ship navigation in low visibility would increase the likelihood of a collision or grounding piracies and armed robberies are the main anthropogenic hazards to ships and have emerged as great threats to the safety of navigation lim et al 2018 maps of these hazard criteria are presented in fig 3 3 3 criteria for vulnerability and exposure vulnerability and exposure define the extent to which a system is susceptible to the adverse impacts of hazards hoque et al 2019 they are usually combined together because of their complicatedly related properties kelly and adger 2000 to capture these dimensions four criteria mainly focused on physical aspects were selected the vulnerability criteria selected are 1 proximity to coastline 2 proximity to port and 3 proximity to oceanic island reef the exposure criterion selected is 4 vessel traffic density table 3 the number of ships has increased substantially all over the world aggravating their exposure to marine hazards zhang et al 2017 in this study vessel traffic density is defined as the average number of vessels per unit area per unit time wu et al 2017 the spatial pattern of vessel traffic density has a considerable impact on exposure levels fig 4 a in addition proximities to coastline and port are key factors in vulnerability assessment fig 4b and c ships near these areas are more vulnerable to the influence of hazard than those far from such regions because of the concentration of human society and intensity of economic activity in such areas wang et al 2014 the submarine topography in oceanic islands or reefs area varies tremendously the area near the oceanic islands or reefs improves the degree of vulnerability shi et al 2014 fig 4d 3 4 criteria for mitigation capacity mitigation capacity can be considered as the ability to use various measures to mitigate the effects of marine hazards affecting ships navigating at sea this study focuses primarily on the response capacity of external forces e g coast guard to perform maritime search and rescue operations it is assumed that a faster response from rescue forces would decrease the severity of the consequences of an accident zhou et al 2019 hazard vulnerability and exposure are important components of risk that contribute to a ship s navigation risk however mitigation capacity reduces the risk level involving various measures used to mitigate the effects of marine hazards hoque et al 2018 in general coastal states provide maritime search and rescue services when a ship requests assistance karahalios 2018 furthermore adjacent ships in the accident sea area could also respond quickly zhou et al 2019 therefore two criteria were used to capture the pattern of mitigation capacity table 4 1 maritime search and rescue capacity it is defined as the response time from a rescue base to an incident site zhou et al 2019 maritime search and rescue organizations established by coastal states are the main forces in maritime accident response shorter response times can increase the survival rate of people in the water fig 5 a 2 proximity to shipping lane there are many ships along shipping lanes because ships generally sail along a shipping lane to ensure the safety of navigation wang et al 2014 cheng et al 2019 in this study the probability of ship occurrence is supposed to decrease linearly with increasing distance to shipping lane therefore sea areas closer to shipping lanes are considered to offer a high likelihood of rescue by adjacent ships fig 5b 3 5 ranking and standardization the ranking level has a significant impact on the evaluation results an appropriate threshold value of each evaluation criterion would provide better results table 6 presents the threshold values of evaluation criteria for each of the risk classes as determined based on a literature survey e g wang et al 2014 nguyen et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 and expert opinion the range of values of each spatial criterion was categorized into five levels where 1 represents very low risk and 5 represents very high risk a grid cell of 1 k m 1 k m was created for each criterion to apply the weighted overlay approach then all criteria alternative values were standardized to a common scale from 0 to 1 using equation 2 which can allow multi criteria decision making to be conducted on the same scale hoque et al 2018 2 p p v a l u e p m i n p m a x p m i n where p is the standardized value p m a x and p m i n are the maximum and minimum values respectively of each criterion and p v a l u e is the value of grid cell 3 6 weighting the criteria using fahp the fahp technique originally introduced by chang 1996 was applied to weight each criterion the decision makers judge the relative importance of the items in a pair by means of linguistic variables such as equal importance and moderate importance calabrese et al 2016 the linguistic judgments are then converted to triangular fuzzy numbers tfns the comparison scale used in this study is demonstrated in table 7 each tfn consists of a triplet l m u where l represents the smallest value m the most probable value and u the highest possible value of any linguistic judgment representing the relative importance between two factors calabrese et al 2019 let u u 1 u 2 u m be a goal set and x x 1 x 2 x m be an object set then each object is taken and an extent analysis for every goal is performed thus m extent analysis values for each object can be obtained with the following signs m g i 1 m g i 2 m g i m i 1 2 n where m g i j j 1 2 m indicates a triangular fuzzy number the fahp method includes the following four steps chang 1996 mikaeil et al 2009 step 1 the value of the fuzzy synthetic extent with respect to the i th object s i is determined as 3 s i j 1 m m g i j i 1 n j 1 m m g i j 1 to obtain j 1 m m g i j the fuzzy addition operation of m extent analysis values is performed as follows 4 j 1 m m g i j j 1 m l j j 1 m m j j 1 m u j the fuzzy addition operation of m g i j j 1 2 m values is performed to obtain i 1 n j 1 m m g i j 1 as follows 5 i 1 n j 1 m m g i j i 1 n l i i 1 n m i i 1 n u i then the inverse of the vector above is computed as follows 6 i 1 n j 1 m m g i j 1 1 i 1 n u i 1 i 1 n m i 1 i 1 n l i step 2 the degree of possibility of m 2 l 2 m 2 u 2 m 1 l 1 m 1 u 1 can be expressed as follows 7 v m 2 m 1 sup y x m i n μ m 1 x μ m 2 x it can be equivalently defined as below v m 2 m 1 h g t m 2 m 1 μ m 2 d 8 1 i f m 2 m 1 0 i f l 1 u 2 l 1 u 2 m 2 u 2 m 1 l 1 o t h e r w i s e where d represents the ordinate of the highest intersection point between μ m 1 and μ m 2 and h g t represents the height step 3 the degree of possibility for a convex fuzzy number to be greater than k convex fuzzy numbers m i i 1 2 k can be defined as 9 v m m 1 m 2 m k v m m 1 a n d m m 2 a n d a n d m m k min v m m i i 1 2 3 k assume that d a i min v s i s k k 1 2 n k i therefore the weight vector can be defined as 10 w d a 1 d a 2 d a n t where a i i 1 2 n contains n elements step 4 after normalization the normalized weight vectors are as follows 11 w d a 1 d a 2 d a n t where w represents a non fuzzy number in this study five marine experts were invited to establish a triangular fuzzy comparison matrix according to the triangular fuzzy conversion scale table 7 then the criterion weights calculated from the triangular fuzzy comparison matrix are shown in table 8 3 7 risk assessment using the weighted overlay approach the hazard vulnerability and exposure and mitigation capacity indices were first created individually in the arcgis platform then the indices were classified into five categories i e very low low moderate high and very high for generating hazard vulnerability and exposure and mitigation capacity maps finally according to equation 1 a risk index was obtained by multiplying hazard and vulnerability with exposure indices and then dividing by the mitigation capacity index using the raster calculator in the arcgis platform the risk index was then standardized using equation 2 and categorized into five classes i e very low low moderate high and very high to produce an overall risk map 3 8 one at a time method the one at a time method was used for sensitivity analysis which estimates the effect of variations in a single input parameter on the evaluation results while maintaining all other parameters at their nominal values xu and zhang 2013 this method has been widely applied in spatial sensitivity analyses for multi criteria decision making xu and zhang 2013 the equation is given as follows qiu et al 2017 12 r w j c r w j 1 c r x j i j n w j 1 w j 1 c r 1 w j x i 13 m a c r w j c r k 1 n 1 n r k w j c r r 0 r 0 100 where r represents the risk evaluation result w represents the original weight of the criterion cr represents the change rate of a weight x represents the standard score of criterion i and j represent the i th and j th criterion respectively i j macr w j c r represents the average value of the absolute change rate k represents the k th pixel n represents the number of pixels in the risk map and r 0 represents the original value of the risk evaluation result high macr values indicate a high sensitivity 4 results and discussion 4 1 hazard analysis the hazard map illustrates the spatial variation of hazard in the scs as shown in fig 6 approximately 13 1 and 31 5 of the scs is located in zones with high and very high levels of hazard respectively these zones mainly lie in the central and northern scs the area classified as a medium hazard zone accounts for 14 3 of the scs and is mostly concentrated in the coastal areas of the central and northern scs the low and very low hazard zones cover 20 8 and 20 3 of the total area of the scs respectively and most of them are located in the southern scs several important factors such as high gale frequency high wave frequency high typhoon frequency as well as lower visibility account for the high level and very high level zones in the hazard maps in contrast the southern area of the scs was discovered to be less prone to hazards because of the less likely influence of meteorological conditions as discussed in wang et al 2014 which indicated that the meteorological conditions have an important influence on the spatial distribution of marine disasters in the scs 4 2 vulnerability and exposure analysis a vulnerability and exposure map was generated by dividing the vulnerability and exposure index values into five levels as shown in fig 7 the results indicate that the areas classified as medium to very high vulnerability and exposure account for 55 4 of the scs these regions are mostly located in the coastal areas of the scs the proximity to coastlines and ports and high ship densities are major factors influencing the distribution of high vulnerability and exposure conversely very low to low vulnerability and exposure levels cover 44 6 of the scs concentrated in central sea areas farther from the coastlines the main reason for those differences is that these regions are located farther from coastlines and ports and have comparatively less ship traffic in general their lower navigation activity levels reduce the sensitivity of these regions to the adverse effects of hazards 4 3 mitigation capacity analysis fig 8 presents the spatial pattern of the mitigation capacity the results illustrate that 19 2 of the scs is classified into the level of very high mitigation capacity the areas classified into the high mitigation capacity level cover 29 8 of the scs most of the areas classified as being of high or very high mitigation capacity are located along coastlines with easy access to basic infrastructures such as maritime search and rescue bases however most sea areas farther from the coastlines are classified as medium low or very low mitigation capacity levels 23 9 19 5 and 7 6 of the scs respectively these areas especially the more remote ones are characterized by a lack of adequate mitigation features zhou et al 2019 as mentioned by guo et al 2019 the long range maritime search and rescue services are still facing many challenges in search and rescue operations and need to be improved 4 4 risk analysis the overall risk map produced shown in fig 9 illustrates the significant spatial variation of risk zones of the very high risk level cover 19 8 of the scs whereas high risk zones cover 19 1 of the scs these zones are located mainly in the northern scs and partly in the central scs along the shipping lane from singapore to hong kong in the malacca strait and in the southwestern coastal areas of the philippines medium risk zones cover 20 7 of the scs most of these areas are located along the shipping lane from singapore to hong kong and the luzon strait and in the southwestern coastal area of palawan zones of low and very low risk account for 40 4 of the scs these areas are mainly located in the central and southern regions of scs among the important factors that contribute to the high or very high risk are the proximity to coastlines and ports high ship densities strong impacts of meteorological conditions and lower mitigation capacities the southern area and some of the central areas of the scs are regarded as being of comparatively low risk because of lower hazard levels and better mitigation capacity features 4 5 validation validation of the results of this assessment enables us to determine whether the proposed approach is suitable for its intended use in this study data on 135 historical accidents during 2011 2018 obtained from the global integrated shipping information system were used to validate the results the locations of these accidents are illustrated in fig 10 a moreover fig 10b shows that the combined percentage of incidents in zones of very high risk and high risk was 81 5 this high percentage more than 80 is considered to be adequate validation of the assessment results wang et al 2014 4 6 sensitivity analysis based on the one at a time method we further conducted a sensitivity analysis by changing the weights of each criterion from 50 to 50 with a step size of 10 fig 11 shows macr values for maritime transportation risk evaluation the macr values show a linear increase with different slopes for each criterion when the change rate of the weights increases a higher slope indicates a higher sensitivity of the criterion for the evaluation results xu and zhang 2013 the ranking of the macr values for all criteria is as follows maritime search and rescue capacity vessel traffic density proximity to shipping lane proximity to port typhoon pressure typhoon frequency proximity to coastline water depth proximity to oceanic island reef big wave frequency gale frequency piracy and armed robbery frequency precipitation fog clearly maritime search and rescue capacity the highest ranked criterion is the most sensitive whereas fog the lowest ranked criterion is the least sensitive taking the weight of a 50 change as an example maritime search and rescue capacity and fog exhibited macr values of 8 5 and 1 2 respectively in addition different decision makers can set different weights and thus generate a variety of results fig 11 further shows that all the macr values are significantly lower than the change rate of the weights indicating that the evaluation results are relatively robust and reliable qiu et al 2017 5 conclusions this study presents a spatial fuzzy multi criteria evaluation approach for assessing and mapping maritime transportation risk based on geospatial techniques and multi criteria decision making three risk components hazard vulnerability and exposure and mitigation capacity were assessed to produce a risk map the results obtained were generally confirmed using historical accident data sensitivity analysis also indicated the results are robust the risk map illustrates an obvious spatial variation of navigation risk in the scs very high risk and high risk zones 38 9 of the scs were found to locate mainly in the northern scs along the shipping lane in the central scs from singapore to hong kong in the malacca strait and the southwestern coastal areas of the philippines medium risk zones 20 7 of the scs were found to distribute along the shipping lanes in the scs from singapore to hong kong the luzon strait and the coast of southwest palawan in contrast low and very low risk zones 40 4 of the scs were found to be mainly concentrated in central and southern areas of the scs the results of this study have two key implications for research on maritime transportation risk assessment first incorporation of spatial multi criteria risk assessment into maritime security planning is crucial to mitigating navigation risk second a risk map makes it possible to understand the spatial characteristics of maritime transportation risk and identify risk hot spots which can help related governments to develop effective mitigation strategies to protect crews and ships from the negative effects of marine disasters furthermore minimization of the severity of maritime accidents depends largely on the ability of authorities to implement schemes and apply efficient mitigation strategies according to the aforementioned conclusions the following mitigation strategies for high risk and very high risk areas in the scs are proposed first it is suggested that the authorities improve the maritime sar service level in remote sea areas e g by increasing the frequency of maritime patrol in these areas and by optimizing the allocation of emergency resources second the comprehensive sar ability after joint sar implementation is substantially stronger than that of any single country therefore the international cooperation mechanism on maritime sar should be implemented in this region a joint rescue co ordination center needs to be established with the aim to assume unified command of sar forces third some islands in the scs should be considered as island rescue bases with the power to provide maritime sar services in order to provide long range maritime search and rescue services there are several limitations to this study it is very challenging to obtain high quality data for each criterion considered for example available 0 125 resolution marine environmental data including wind wave low cloud cover and precipitation data were used in this study it is suggested that high quality data should be used to produce criteria maps because such data can provide better results also because of the lack of sea fog data low level cloud data could be used to calculate visibility richer data would enhance the accuracy of the visibility estimates another limitation is that we considered the maritime search and rescue bases established by governments to provide the main search and rescue force and it is considered as the same however civil ports may join maritime search and rescue operations although their participation is uncertain and the equipment of each base may be different future work should focus on overcoming these limitations in addition in this study the threshold values were set after considering the characteristics of the main ship types in the study area which represents a suitable trade off between applicability and accuracy for example the threshold for water depth was set to 20 m and was then divided into five classes in order to identify the navigation risk in the scs therefore the threshold values may need to be modified when analyzing a certain type of ship such as a large commercial ship despite these limitations however the approach used in this study is considered to be effective in supporting decision making and planning concerning efficient risk reduction measures because many sea areas of the world face similar challenges the maritime transportation risk assessment approach developed and evaluated in this study is expected to be applicable to mapping navigation risks in other seas credit authorship contribution statement

in this study in section 3 the methodological framework is introduced section 4 presents the results of the analysis and discussion in section 5 the conclusions are summarized and policy implications are presented 2 study area and datasets this study area we selected is the scs which is a large marginal sea the scs extends from 23 n to 3 s and from 102 e to 121 e fig 1 it covers an area of 3 5 10 6 km 2 and the average depth of the water is more than 2000 m lan et al 2013 zhou et al 2019 this region is one of the most heavily traveled ocean areas in the world and is bordered by china the philippines vietnam brunei singapore and malaysia and the main shipping lanes in these sea areas are shown in fig 1 the world factbook 2015 it is also known as a dangerous area due to shallow waters rocks typhoons pirates etc knapp and van de velden 2011 wang et al 2014 losses resulting from shipping accidents in the scs from 2006 to 2015 were the greatest compared with other regions around the world weng et al 2018 in this study the selected criteria were mapped using various data sources including governments international organizations and commercial companies some of the selected criteria are dynamic because their datasets are updated continuously such as low cloud cover 10 m wind speed significant wave height in this context these criteria were mapped by using an average of the data of various years thereby revealing a comprehensive characteristic among these criteria table 1 shows a list of the datasets used including data name source period and output the arcgis software v 10 3 was used to conduct spatial analysis and prepare spatial criterion layers 3 methods 3 1 overview in this study the risk is defined as the possibility of the occurrence of hazardous accidents or abnormal incidents during ship navigation at sea hu et al 2007 a well developed risk equation can give rise to better risk evaluation goerlandt and montewka 2015 hoque et al 2018 in general risk can be considered as a function of hazard vulnerability exposure and mitigation capacity and is calculated as follows hoque et al 2019 mansour 2019 sajjad and chan 2019 1 r i s k h a z a r d v u l n e r a b i l i t y e x p o s u r e m i t i g a t i o n c a p a c i t y this definition shows that increments in hazard vulnerability and exposure will lead to higher risk directly proportional but an increment in mitigation capacity will lead to lower risk inversely proportional to obtain the risk value the indices of the hazard vulnerability and exposure and mitigation capacity are first generated individually then according to equation 1 the risk value equals hazard index multiplies operator x vulnerability and exposure index and divided by mitigation capacity index operator in this study a spatial fuzzy multi criteria evaluation approach was developed for use as a foundation for calculating ship navigation risk the steps in this approach include identification quantification ranking weighting of the criteria and map generation a fahp technique which can incorporate and aggregate multiple criteria efficiently hoque et al 2019 li et al 2019 was used to weight the criteria then a hazard map vulnerability and exposure map and mitigation capacity map are generated respectively finally a risk map is created by incorporating three risk components fig 2 presents the methodological flowchart used in the proposed approach 3 2 criteria for hazard a hazard can be understood as a process or phenomenon that may result in loss of life damage to property environmental pollution and social disruption unisdr 2019 the first step in this study was to identify the natural and man made hazards that exist in the navigation environment various types of hazards threaten ship navigation on the sea following an extensive review of the ship navigation environment balmat et al 2009 mokhtari et al 2011 wang et al 2014 sahin and kum 2015 zhang et al 2016 khan et al 2018 tian et al 2018 eight criteria were selected for use table 2 1 water depth 2 typhoon pressure 3 typhoon frequency 4 gale frequency 5 big wave frequency 6 fog 7 precipitation and 8 piracy and armed robbery frequency water depth has a significant influence on ship navigation safety sea areas with low depth cause ship grounding the threshold for which was set to 20 m in this study wang et al 2014 huang et al 2019 water depth greater than 20 m was regarded as safe for ship navigation typhoons are considered to be among the deadliest climatic disasters posing great threat and harm to navigation safety and personal safety bakkensen and mendelsohn 2019 typhoon frequency and pressure influence the hazard intensity for a particular area nguyen et al 2019 in addition gales can cause ships to drift sideways thus to improve the width requirement for maneuvering briggs et al 2003 big waves mainly affect heave pitch and yaw briggs et al 2003 we defined a wind with a speed higher than 11 7 m s as a gale and any wave with a wave height of more than 6 m as a big wave wang et al 2014 to assess the influence of visibility on the ship navigation fog and precipitation should be considered systematically jiang et al 2016 ship navigation in low visibility would increase the likelihood of a collision or grounding piracies and armed robberies are the main anthropogenic hazards to ships and have emerged as great threats to the safety of navigation lim et al 2018 maps of these hazard criteria are presented in fig 3 3 3 criteria for vulnerability and exposure vulnerability and exposure define the extent to which a system is susceptible to the adverse impacts of hazards hoque et al 2019 they are usually combined together because of their complicatedly related properties kelly and adger 2000 to capture these dimensions four criteria mainly focused on physical aspects were selected the vulnerability criteria selected are 1 proximity to coastline 2 proximity to port and 3 proximity to oceanic island reef the exposure criterion selected is 4 vessel traffic density table 3 the number of ships has increased substantially all over the world aggravating their exposure to marine hazards zhang et al 2017 in this study vessel traffic density is defined as the average number of vessels per unit area per unit time wu et al 2017 the spatial pattern of vessel traffic density has a considerable impact on exposure levels fig 4 a in addition proximities to coastline and port are key factors in vulnerability assessment fig 4b and c ships near these areas are more vulnerable to the influence of hazard than those far from such regions because of the concentration of human society and intensity of economic activity in such areas wang et al 2014 the submarine topography in oceanic islands or reefs area varies tremendously the area near the oceanic islands or reefs improves the degree of vulnerability shi et al 2014 fig 4d 3 4 criteria for mitigation capacity mitigation capacity can be considered as the ability to use various measures to mitigate the effects of marine hazards affecting ships navigating at sea this study focuses primarily on the response capacity of external forces e g coast guard to perform maritime search and rescue operations it is assumed that a faster response from rescue forces would decrease the severity of the consequences of an accident zhou et al 2019 hazard vulnerability and exposure are important components of risk that contribute to a ship s navigation risk however mitigation capacity reduces the risk level involving various measures used to mitigate the effects of marine hazards hoque et al 2018 in general coastal states provide maritime search and rescue services when a ship requests assistance karahalios 2018 furthermore adjacent ships in the accident sea area could also respond quickly zhou et al 2019 therefore two criteria were used to capture the pattern of mitigation capacity table 4 1 maritime search and rescue capacity it is defined as the response time from a rescue base to an incident site zhou et al 2019 maritime search and rescue organizations established by coastal states are the main forces in maritime accident response shorter response times can increase the survival rate of people in the water fig 5 a 2 proximity to shipping lane there are many ships along shipping lanes because ships generally sail along a shipping lane to ensure the safety of navigation wang et al 2014 cheng et al 2019 in this study the probability of ship occurrence is supposed to decrease linearly with increasing distance to shipping lane therefore sea areas closer to shipping lanes are considered to offer a high likelihood of rescue by adjacent ships fig 5b 3 5 ranking and standardization the ranking level has a significant impact on the evaluation results an appropriate threshold value of each evaluation criterion would provide better results table 6 presents the threshold values of evaluation criteria for each of the risk classes as determined based on a literature survey e g wang et al 2014 nguyen et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 and expert opinion the range of values of each spatial criterion was categorized into five levels where 1 represents very low risk and 5 represents very high risk a grid cell of 1 k m 1 k m was created for each criterion to apply the weighted overlay approach then all criteria alternative values were standardized to a common scale from 0 to 1 using equation 2 which can allow multi criteria decision making to be conducted on the same scale hoque et al 2018 2 p p v a l u e p m i n p m a x p m i n where p is the standardized value p m a x and p m i n are the maximum and minimum values respectively of each criterion and p v a l u e is the value of grid cell 3 6 weighting the criteria using fahp the fahp technique originally introduced by chang 1996 was applied to weight each criterion the decision makers judge the relative importance of the items in a pair by means of linguistic variables such as equal importance and moderate importance calabrese et al 2016 the linguistic judgments are then converted to triangular fuzzy numbers tfns the comparison scale used in this study is demonstrated in table 7 each tfn consists of a triplet l m u where l represents the smallest value m the most probable value and u the highest possible value of any linguistic judgment representing the relative importance between two factors calabrese et al 2019 let u u 1 u 2 u m be a goal set and x x 1 x 2 x m be an object set then each object is taken and an extent analysis for every goal is performed thus m extent analysis values for each object can be obtained with the following signs m g i 1 m g i 2 m g i m i 1 2 n where m g i j j 1 2 m indicates a triangular fuzzy number the fahp method includes the following four steps chang 1996 mikaeil et al 2009 step 1 the value of the fuzzy synthetic extent with respect to the i th object s i is determined as 3 s i j 1 m m g i j i 1 n j 1 m m g i j 1 to obtain j 1 m m g i j the fuzzy addition operation of m extent analysis values is performed as follows 4 j 1 m m g i j j 1 m l j j 1 m m j j 1 m u j the fuzzy addition operation of m g i j j 1 2 m values is performed to obtain i 1 n j 1 m m g i j 1 as follows 5 i 1 n j 1 m m g i j i 1 n l i i 1 n m i i 1 n u i then the inverse of the vector above is computed as follows 6 i 1 n j 1 m m g i j 1 1 i 1 n u i 1 i 1 n m i 1 i 1 n l i step 2 the degree of possibility of m 2 l 2 m 2 u 2 m 1 l 1 m 1 u 1 can be expressed as follows 7 v m 2 m 1 sup y x m i n μ m 1 x μ m 2 x it can be equivalently defined as below v m 2 m 1 h g t m 2 m 1 μ m 2 d 8 1 i f m 2 m 1 0 i f l 1 u 2 l 1 u 2 m 2 u 2 m 1 l 1 o t h e r w i s e where d represents the ordinate of the highest intersection point between μ m 1 and μ m 2 and h g t represents the height step 3 the degree of possibility for a convex fuzzy number to be greater than k convex fuzzy numbers m i i 1 2 k can be defined as 9 v m m 1 m 2 m k v m m 1 a n d m m 2 a n d a n d m m k min v m m i i 1 2 3 k assume that d a i min v s i s k k 1 2 n k i therefore the weight vector can be defined as 10 w d a 1 d a 2 d a n t where a i i 1 2 n contains n elements step 4 after normalization the normalized weight vectors are as follows 11 w d a 1 d a 2 d a n t where w represents a non fuzzy number in this study five marine experts were invited to establish a triangular fuzzy comparison matrix according to the triangular fuzzy conversion scale table 7 then the criterion weights calculated from the triangular fuzzy comparison matrix are shown in table 8 3 7 risk assessment using the weighted overlay approach the hazard vulnerability and exposure and mitigation capacity indices were first created individually in the arcgis platform then the indices were classified into five categories i e very low low moderate high and very high for generating hazard vulnerability and exposure and mitigation capacity maps finally according to equation 1 a risk index was obtained by multiplying hazard and vulnerability with exposure indices and then dividing by the mitigation capacity index using the raster calculator in the arcgis platform the risk index was then standardized using equation 2 and categorized into five classes i e very low low moderate high and very high to produce an overall risk map 3 8 one at a time method the one at a time method was used for sensitivity analysis which estimates the effect of variations in a single input parameter on the evaluation results while maintaining all other parameters at their nominal values xu and zhang 2013 this method has been widely applied in spatial sensitivity analyses for multi criteria decision making xu and zhang 2013 the equation is given as follows qiu et al 2017 12 r w j c r w j 1 c r x j i j n w j 1 w j 1 c r 1 w j x i 13 m a c r w j c r k 1 n 1 n r k w j c r r 0 r 0 100 where r represents the risk evaluation result w represents the original weight of the criterion cr represents the change rate of a weight x represents the standard score of criterion i and j represent the i th and j th criterion respectively i j macr w j c r represents the average value of the absolute change rate k represents the k th pixel n represents the number of pixels in the risk map and r 0 represents the original value of the risk evaluation result high macr values indicate a high sensitivity 4 results and discussion 4 1 hazard analysis the hazard map illustrates the spatial variation of hazard in the scs as shown in fig 6 approximately 13 1 and 31 5 of the scs is located in zones with high and very high levels of hazard respectively these zones mainly lie in the central and northern scs the area classified as a medium hazard zone accounts for 14 3 of the scs and is mostly concentrated in the coastal areas of the central and northern scs the low and very low hazard zones cover 20 8 and 20 3 of the total area of the scs respectively and most of them are located in the southern scs several important factors such as high gale frequency high wave frequency high typhoon frequency as well as lower visibility account for the high level and very high level zones in the hazard maps in contrast the southern area of the scs was discovered to be less prone to hazards because of the less likely influence of meteorological conditions as discussed in wang et al 2014 which indicated that the meteorological conditions have an important influence on the spatial distribution of marine disasters in the scs 4 2 vulnerability and exposure analysis a vulnerability and exposure map was generated by dividing the vulnerability and exposure index values into five levels as shown in fig 7 the results indicate that the areas classified as medium to very high vulnerability and exposure account for 55 4 of the scs these regions are mostly located in the coastal areas of the scs the proximity to coastlines and ports and high ship densities are major factors influencing the distribution of high vulnerability and exposure conversely very low to low vulnerability and exposure levels cover 44 6 of the scs concentrated in central sea areas farther from the coastlines the main reason for those differences is that these regions are located farther from coastlines and ports and have comparatively less ship traffic in general their lower navigation activity levels reduce the sensitivity of these regions to the adverse effects of hazards 4 3 mitigation capacity analysis fig 8 presents the spatial pattern of the mitigation capacity the results illustrate that 19 2 of the scs is classified into the level of very high mitigation capacity the areas classified into the high mitigation capacity level cover 29 8 of the scs most of the areas classified as being of high or very high mitigation capacity are located along coastlines with easy access to basic infrastructures such as maritime search and rescue bases however most sea areas farther from the coastlines are classified as medium low or very low mitigation capacity levels 23 9 19 5 and 7 6 of the scs respectively these areas especially the more remote ones are characterized by a lack of adequate mitigation features zhou et al 2019 as mentioned by guo et al 2019 the long range maritime search and rescue services are still facing many challenges in search and rescue operations and need to be improved 4 4 risk analysis the overall risk map produced shown in fig 9 illustrates the significant spatial variation of risk zones of the very high risk level cover 19 8 of the scs whereas high risk zones cover 19 1 of the scs these zones are located mainly in the northern scs and partly in the central scs along the shipping lane from singapore to hong kong in the malacca strait and in the southwestern coastal areas of the philippines medium risk zones cover 20 7 of the scs most of these areas are located along the shipping lane from singapore to hong kong and the luzon strait and in the southwestern coastal area of palawan zones of low and very low risk account for 40 4 of the scs these areas are mainly located in the central and southern regions of scs among the important factors that contribute to the high or very high risk are the proximity to coastlines and ports high ship densities strong impacts of meteorological conditions and lower mitigation capacities the southern area and some of the central areas of the scs are regarded as being of comparatively low risk because of lower hazard levels and better mitigation capacity features 4 5 validation validation of the results of this assessment enables us to determine whether the proposed approach is suitable for its intended use in this study data on 135 historical accidents during 2011 2018 obtained from the global integrated shipping information system were used to validate the results the locations of these accidents are illustrated in fig 10 a moreover fig 10b shows that the combined percentage of incidents in zones of very high risk and high risk was 81 5 this high percentage more than 80 is considered to be adequate validation of the assessment results wang et al 2014 4 6 sensitivity analysis based on the one at a time method we further conducted a sensitivity analysis by changing the weights of each criterion from 50 to 50 with a step size of 10 fig 11 shows macr values for maritime transportation risk evaluation the macr values show a linear increase with different slopes for each criterion when the change rate of the weights increases a higher slope indicates a higher sensitivity of the criterion for the evaluation results xu and zhang 2013 the ranking of the macr values for all criteria is as follows maritime search and rescue capacity vessel traffic density proximity to shipping lane proximity to port typhoon pressure typhoon frequency proximity to coastline water depth proximity to oceanic island reef big wave frequency gale frequency piracy and armed robbery frequency precipitation fog clearly maritime search and rescue capacity the highest ranked criterion is the most sensitive whereas fog the lowest ranked criterion is the least sensitive taking the weight of a 50 change as an example maritime search and rescue capacity and fog exhibited macr values of 8 5 and 1 2 respectively in addition different decision makers can set different weights and thus generate a variety of results fig 11 further shows that all the macr values are significantly lower than the change rate of the weights indicating that the evaluation results are relatively robust and reliable qiu et al 2017 5 conclusions this study presents a spatial fuzzy multi criteria evaluation approach for assessing and mapping maritime transportation risk based on geospatial techniques and multi criteria decision making three risk components hazard vulnerability and exposure and mitigation capacity were assessed to produce a risk map the results obtained were generally confirmed using historical accident data sensitivity analysis also indicated the results are robust the risk map illustrates an obvious spatial variation of navigation risk in the scs very high risk and high risk zones 38 9 of the scs were found to locate mainly in the northern scs along the shipping lane in the central scs from singapore to hong kong in the malacca strait and the southwestern coastal areas of the philippines medium risk zones 20 7 of the scs were found to distribute along the shipping lanes in the scs from singapore to hong kong the luzon strait and the coast of southwest palawan in contrast low and very low risk zones 40 4 of the scs were found to be mainly concentrated in central and southern areas of the scs the results of this study have two key implications for research on maritime transportation risk assessment first incorporation of spatial multi criteria risk assessment into maritime security planning is crucial to mitigating navigation risk second a risk map makes it possible to understand the spatial characteristics of maritime transportation risk and identify risk hot spots which can help related governments to develop effective mitigation strategies to protect crews and ships from the negative effects of marine disasters furthermore minimization of the severity of maritime accidents depends largely on the ability of authorities to implement schemes and apply efficient mitigation strategies according to the aforementioned conclusions the following mitigation strategies for high risk and very high risk areas in the scs are proposed first it is suggested that the authorities improve the maritime sar service level in remote sea areas e g by increasing the frequency of maritime patrol in these areas and by optimizing the allocation of emergency resources second the comprehensive sar ability after joint sar implementation is substantially stronger than that of any single country therefore the international cooperation mechanism on maritime sar should be implemented in this region a joint rescue co ordination center needs to be established with the aim to assume unified command of sar forces third some islands in the scs should be considered as island rescue bases with the power to provide maritime sar services in order to provide long range maritime search and rescue services there are several limitations to this study it is very challenging to obtain high quality data for each criterion considered for example available 0 125 resolution marine environmental data including wind wave low cloud cover and precipitation data were used in this study it is suggested that high quality data should be used to produce criteria maps because such data can provide better results also because of the lack of sea fog data low level cloud data could be used to calculate visibility richer data would enhance the accuracy of the visibility estimates another limitation is that we considered the maritime search and rescue bases established by governments to provide the main search and rescue force and it is considered as the same however civil ports may join maritime search and rescue operations although their participation is uncertain and the equipment of each base may be different future work should focus on overcoming these limitations in addition in this study the threshold values were set after considering the characteristics of the main ship types in the study area which represents a suitable trade off between applicability and accuracy for example the threshold for water depth was set to 20 m and was then divided into five classes in order to identify the navigation risk in the scs therefore the threshold values may need to be modified when analyzing a certain type of ship such as a large commercial ship despite these limitations however the approach used in this study is considered to be effective in supporting decision making and planning concerning efficient risk reduction measures because many sea areas of the world face similar challenges the maritime transportation risk assessment approach developed and evaluated in this study is expected to be applicable to mapping navigation risks in other seas credit authorship contribution statement

21816,a hybrid tsunami defense system comprising vegetation v an embankment e and a moat m while changing the order of the components and the inundation depth of vegetation was investigated in a flume using a surge type flow produced by quickly lifting a gate compared with the hybrid defense system in which vegetation is emergent the tsunami mitigation effects of seaward vegetation became smaller than the other types because the reflections were weakened by the reduction of vegetation resistance in the submerged condition based on the decrease in overflow volume fluid force and moment by fluid force the optimal structures of seaward and landward submerged vegetation types were the same order of v m and e vme type and e m and v emv type from seaward respectively as those in the emergent condition differences in tsunami mitigation effects due to vegetation renewal were demonstrated in vme and emv types by changing the horizontal vegetation structure although the mitigation effects of horizontally combined types were in between emergent and submerged conditions the water surface gradient behind the forest which is related to erosion and driftwood production showed a clear difference in the order of submerged and emergent vegetation keywords energy reduction hydraulic jump vegetation resistance fluid force overflow volume 1 introduction the 2011 great east japan tsunami gejt greatly exceeded the disaster prevention capacity of the existing sea embankment and caused great damage to forests and properties in the hinterland of the coastal area tappin et al 2012 tanaka 2012 after the gejt the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism of japan mlit classified tsunamis into two categories level 1 disaster prevention level in which the recurrent period is less than around a hundred years and level 2 disaster mitigation level in which the recurrent period is several hundred to a thousand years because the current embankment height was designed for a level 1 tsunami a disaster mitigation method for a level 2 tsunami needs to be developed igarashi and tanaka 2018 zaha et al 2019 although the tsunami mitigation functions of a coastal forest by energy reduction and trapping floating debris were widely recognized in previous studies shuto 1987 hiraishi and harada 2003 harada and imamura 2006 irtem et al 2009 iimura and tanaka 2012 nandasena et al 2012 pasha and tanaka 2017 parts of forests were destroyed in the 2004 indian ocean tsunami iot and 2011 gejt and their effectiveness was largely reduced by the destruction tanaka et al 2013 2014 in extreme hazards a natural system sometimes loses its function due to its destruction so natural plus built infrastructures hybrid approaches are recommended to enhance the coastal resilience in the protection from storm and coastal flooding tanaka et al 2014 sutton grier et al 2015 recently studies on compound or hybrid defense systems against a tsunami have been conducted i e a sea embankment combined with a coastal forest tanaka et al 2014 igarashi and tanaka 2018 rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 a moat with without a forest usman et al 2014 a moat or canal behind an embankment mineura et al 2013 tokida and tanimoto 2014 tsujimoto et al 2014 rahman et al 2017 and a double embankment system tanaka and igarashi 2016 usman et al 2014 demonstrated numerically that a hybrid system comprised of a forest with inland moats could effectively reduce the inundation depth and flow velocity usman et al 2014 for adapting the hybrid defense systems in a coastal environment the effects of tsunami mitigation need to be quantified under various tsunami heights forest conditions tree density tree height etc and their interactions emergent or submerged vegetation condition after the gejt a defense system that strengthens the disaster mitigation function of existing coastal forests by combining them with a moat and an embankment hybrid system was proposed hfs 2016 and constructed in shiranuka town hokkaido prefecture for a future level 2 tsunami according to the forest type where available land exists on seaward landward or both sides of the forest the optimal type was examined experimentally when the forest is not damaged and in an emergent condition through the mechanisms by which a hybrid defense system decreases the tsunami energy in relation to the physical phenomenon i e increasing the reflection effect utilizing a hydraulic jump zaha et al 2019 however information on the role of a submerged forest in the hybrid system is not adequate to fully understand and utilize the tsunami mitigation ability of the proposed system because trees may be broken in a large tsunami and its effects are reduced when the forest becomes submerged tanaka et al 2018 the submerged condition can be assumed when the tsunami height is large and tree height is small due to exposure to strong salt spray or recent planting sometimes in an updated condition or trees are bent by the destructive force the relationship between forest management and wind damage has been assessed and the resistance and damage are dependent on the tree species and stand structures peltola et al 1999 gardiner et al 2000 meanwhile the development of coastal forest management techniques against tsunamis is delayed due to the low frequency of tsunamis when compared with wind damage torita et al 2018 forest management for tsunami mitigation was discussed in previous studies paying attention to the differences of tree species and tree crown heights in numerical simulations harada and kawata 2005 tanaka et al 2018 various tree stand characteristics torita and tanaka 2018 and changes in tree density and stand structures by tree thinning igarashi et al 2019 however the effects of harvesting for renewal of a forest were not discussed in previous research the relationship between forest management and the change of effectiveness in a hybrid system was not clearly elucidated although zaha et al 2019 conducted experimental study and clarified the effectiveness of the optimal hybrid defense structures with the emergent vegetation condition however the vegetation characteristics are changed with their growth and the management harada and kawata 2005 igarashi et al 2019 in addition the effectiveness itself has also a possibility to be changed therefore the objective of this study was to clarify the tsunami mitigation effects of hybrid defense systems in the scenarios of zaha et al 2019 where there is constructible land seaward landward or on both sides of a coastal forest by changing the forest condition from emergent to submerged or a mixed condition of submergence using a flume that can produce a surge type flow the mitigation effects of each combination model in the submerged condition were compared paying special attention to the reflection transmission hydraulic jump and vegetation resistance and to differences with the previous emergent vegetation cases zaha et al 2019 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus and procedures this study used the same facility and similar hydraulic conditions reported by zaha et al 2019 i e a flume 1800 cm in length and 40 cm in width that can generate a surge type flow by quickly lifting a gate fig 1 a and b a constant bed slope of 1 10 was set from 450 to 505 cm downstream from the gate and the hybrid design model was laid after 505 cm in a horizontal bed the physical scale of the model was set at 1 100 considering the scale of the wave flume and froude similarity was applied an incoming surge type flow was generated by setting the still water depth at hs 5 5 cm and the tank water depth at ht 15 20 or 25 cm although it is a little difficult to make a 1 h wave period tsunami on an actual scale eight separate tsunami waves were recorded in around 28 min around 200 s per tsunami wave by a gps wave gauge at the northern part of iwate prefecture off the coast of kuji in the 2011 gejt tanaka et al 2016 the wave period of this study and that of zaha et al 2019 was 150 s in actual scale 15 s in model scale using the froude similarity law that is similar to the high frequency mode of the tsunami at the 2011 gejt in addition although the tsunami height at the coast can be set at around 1 2 times the embankment height 5 10 m in actual scale a level 2 tsunami in hokkaido is assumed to be around 2 35 m high hfs 2016 thus the experiment did not cover all level 2 tsunami cases although the period and wave height were slightly small and did not fully cover the range this study aimed to mitigate the first wave inundation mainly for evacuation purposes like zaha et al 2019 however a large flume experiment or numerical simulations are needed in the future for elucidating the longer wave period and larger wave height effects a moat and an embankment model were built using wooden boards as shown in fig 1 as was discussed in zaha et al 2019 most of the tsunami affected black pine trees maintained resistance even when the trees were overturned at the 2011 gejt and the crown height of pine trees in sendai plain was high tanaka et al 2014 the diameter of tree trunks at breast height tree height and tree density were 0 2 0 5 m 18 m and 0 20 trees m2 respectively tanaka et al 2013 in the previous research studies trees have been commonly replicated using vertical cylinders of a stiff material e g noarayanan et al 2012 pasha and tanaka 2017 therefore for the tree models circular wooden cylinders were selected and the modulus of elasticity moe of tree models in this study was considered around 16000 mpa the same igarashi and tanaka 2018 considering the real scale the diameter d height spacing sp and density of the wooden cylinders used in this experiment were scaled down to 0 4 cm 18 cm 1 9 cm and 0 22 cylinders cm2 respectively the length of the vegetation models for 40 60 and 80 rows were 80 120 and 160 cm respectively and the vegetation cylinders were arranged in a staggered pattern in addition the height of the submerged vegetation was set at 3 cm assuming that the trees of that same height as the embankment were overturned or that tree height was small because of the strong salt spray or trees were young after planting 2 1 1 experimental condition as shown in fig 1c to clarify the effects of the different hybrid defense systems on tsunami mitigation the orders of the submerged type vegetation moat and embankment were adjusted as well as the number of rows used in the vegetation model for expressing the respective cases in this study n vs e and m were used to represent no system submerged vegetation embankment and moat respectively subscripts of vs indicate the number of vegetation rows the vegetation length was set to be similar to the embankment and moat scale to discuss the optimal arrangement for strengthening the existing forest under limited land conditions the vegetation model had three types based on the number of rows 40 60 and 80 rows for submerged models vs40 vs60 and vs80 and emergent models v40 v60 and v80 zaha et al 2019 respectively the case names were combined in the order of the model arrangement from seaward to landward for example vs40em means the model was set in the order of 40 rows of submerged vegetation an embankment and a moat from the seaward case nnn was considered to be the control experiment for clarifying the reflection from slope component itself for generating a wave the initial hydrostatic depth on the downstream side of the flume gate hs was set at 5 5 cm the initial tank water depths from the still water depth were set to 15 20 and 25 cm respectively for each run ht a bore type flow was generated by quickly lifting the gate the gate used in this study can be lifted up to 15 20 and 25 cm in 0 384 0 512 and 0 640 s respectively with the operating air pressure of 0 65 mpa the froude numbers were estimated as 1 55 1 79 and 2 03 when the tank water depths ht were 15 20 and 25 cm respectively three wave gauges tokyo keisoku company ltd hat 106 hat 30 g1 g2 and g3 were set at 400 507 and 698 cm from the gate respectively for each hybrid model case the average of three runs data was calculated the fixed bed height of the hybrid model 5 5 cm was subtracted from the average of the maximum water level at g2 h g2 max and the maximum wave height h max of the measurement point at g2 was calculated reflection seaward and transmission landward were greatly affected by the non dimensional wave height h calculated by dividing the maximum wave height by the embankment height z e in eq 1 zaha et al 2019 the h that corresponded to the tank water depths of 15 20 and 25 cm were 0 81 1 23 and 1 58 respectively even when there was no embankment in the model the h for the same tank water depth was used for comparing the differences of the models 1 h h m a x z e 2 2 parameters for evaluating effectiveness of each hybrid system for comparing the effectiveness of each hybrid model the same indices as the previous study zaha et al 2019 i e the reflected wave from the model delay in tsunami arrival time overflow volume from the embankment and fluid force index u 2 h where u is the velocity and h is the water depth and moment index u 2 h 2 were used in this study 2 2 1 overflow volume from embankment a retention pool was set behind the hybrid system landward to measure the overflow volume from the embankment in each case fig 1 the overflow volume was estimated using the relationship between the pool water depth and the water volume even in the no embankment case overflow volume was calculated for comparison using the measured flow volume after passing through the vegetation model the rate of reduction of overflow volume δq from the embankment was calculated from eq 2 and the effect on overflow volume in each experimental case was compared using 2 q q n n n q q n n n 100 where q nnn is defined as the overflow volume for case nnn and q is defined in each model case a higher δq means a higher rate of reduction of the overflow volume and shows higher effectiveness of the hybrid system 2 2 2 fluid force index and moment index the fluid force index u 2 h and the moment index u 2 h 2 were used for evaluating destruction of a house tanaka et al 2014 for evaluating the effectiveness of each hybrid system the water depth h at g3 was measured and the flow velocity u at 695 cm from the gate was measured by a laser doppler velocity meter kanomax smart ldvii because it was difficult to measure flow velocity and water depth at the same point the maximum reduction rates of the fluid force index and the moment index were defined as rfi and rmi respectively by eq 3 and eq 4 3 r f i u 2 h n n n u 2 h max u 2 h n n n 100 4 r m i u 2 h 2 n n n u 2 h 2 m a x u 2 h 2 n n n 100 where u 2 h nnn u 2 h 2 nnn u 2 h max and u 2 h 2 max are defined as the maximum values of the fluid force index and moment index the subscripts nnn and max represent the maximum value without a model case case nnn and the maximum value in each model case respectively the higher rfi and rmi are the larger reduction of the fluid force index and the moment index and thus show the effectiveness of the hybrid system for comparing the differences of δq rfi and rmi for each hybrid system an embankment only case case e and a moat only case case m were tested in zaha et al 2019 as shown in table 1 this study used the results for the estimation of eqs 2 4 2 2 3 delay in tsunami arrival time the time series of the water levels after the arrival of the wave at g1 was measured at g3 for evaluating the delay in tsunami arrival time 2 2 4 reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient wave reflection and transmission characteristics were analyzed using the reflection coefficient c r and transmission coefficient c t as 5 c r h r h i 6 c t h t h i where h i is the maximum flow depth at g1 for the case without a slope when there was no slope as well as no hybrid defense system h r is the maximum measured flow depth at g1 with a slope and hybrid system and h t is the maximum measured flow depth at g3 with a slope and hybrid system in general c r and c t were evaluated without a slope huang et al 2011 however this study considered the slope effect as well c r and c t of case nnn which had only the slope in h 0 81 1 23 1 58 were 1 36 1 32 1 33 and 0 69 0 67 0 69 respectively due to the superposition of the coming wave and the reflected wave caused by the slope in case nnn h r was greater than h i and thus c r became greater than 1 wave characteristics is also different with the study of huang et al 2011 in which they conducted experiments using the solitary waves this study used the bore type flow as shown in fig 2 2 2 5 total indices for discussing optimal conditions for discussing the total effectiveness of each hybrid system the four evaluation indices below were as defined by zaha et al 2019 because the order of the effectiveness was changed with h 7 e δ q i 1 3 h δ q a i i 1 3 h i 8 e a t i 1 2 h a t a a t n n n a i i 1 2 h i 9 e r f i i 1 2 h r f i a i i 1 2 h i 10 e r m i i 1 2 h r m i a i i 1 2 h i where e q e at e rfi and e rmi are the evaluation indices for δq arrival time rfi and rmi respectively and where subscript a means the average value for each model and wave height at nnna and at a mean the average arrival time for the control case nnn and each hybrid model respectively for the summation σ i should be from 1 to 3 three wave heights however in all cases with the embankment and h 0 81 arrival time rfi and rmi could not be measured therefore e at e rfi and e rmi were only estimated for wave height h 1 23 and 1 58 and thus i is only from 1 to 2 for eqs 8 10 3 results the indices defined in the previous section c r c t δq rfi and rmi were estimated and compared to select an optimal hybrid system for submerged vegetation cases table 1 standard deviations sd of δq rfi and rmi are mostly far smaller than the differences in the cases although the quantitative values were different the tendencies of the indices were similar to those shown in zaha et al 2019 c r and c t are shown in fig 3 the results show that c r is always greater than 1 because of the reason that the flow depths were increased due to the superposition of the coming wave and the reflected wave caused by the slope and hybrid structures as compared to the case without a slope therefore the sum of c r and c t was not equal to or less than unity in this study when the reflection seaward increased c r and c t took larger and smaller values respectively and δq increased overflow volume decreased therefore c r and δq showed similar trends and c t and δq showed opposite trends within each vegetation type 3 1 effects of submerged hybrid systems 3 1 1 comparison of δq reduction rate of overflow volume 3 1 1 1 single structures δq of single structures are shown in fig 4 a the δq of all the single structures got smaller with increasing h because the reflection coefficient c r decreased accordingly table 1 when the tsunami water depth became high the ratio of the tree resistance against the tsunami fluid force was relatively low this is because the resistance is associated with the cylinder drag which exists only within the height of a cylinder in the submerged condition δq of submerged vegetation cases were reduced to around 16 in 40 rows cases vs40nn nnvs40 and nvs40n and 23 in 80 rows case vs80 which were smaller than the emergent cases 40 47 in 40 rows cases v40nn nnv40 and nv40n and 56 in 80 rows case v80 3 1 1 2 hybrid system hs of seaward vegetation type the difference between δq of the seaward vegetation cases with emergent and submerged conditions became higher with increasing h as shown in fig 4b this was mainly caused by the difference of reflected waves to seaward fig 5 shows the time series of water levels at g1 when h 1 58 in cases vs40nn vs80 vs40ne vs40me and vs40em which have a seaward vegetation model the differences between the hybrid defense systems of a landward vegetation type and a center vegetation type are not shown because they were small in the reflected waves of the emergent and submerged vegetation the solid lines show the data for emergent vegetation cases zaha et al 2019 and the dotted lines show those for submerged vegetation cases this study the increase in water levels from 0 s to 2 s a and from 2 s to 3 s b were due to the waves arriving at g1 and the waves reflected by the slope respectively waves reflected by the vegetation model start from 3 s the waves reflected by the embankment started from 5 5 s in cases vs40ne vs40me and vs40em water levels of the cases of submerged vegetation with the embankment at g1 were almost the same with those of emergent vegetation cases after 6 s water levels of submerged vegetation cases were always smaller than those of emergent vegetation cases between the start of waves reflected by the vegetation and the start of those by the embankment 3 0 s 6 0 s moreover with increasing h c r of cases vs40ne vs40me and vs40em this study became smaller however those of cases v40ne v40me and v40em zaha et al 2019 became bigger table 1 in other words the differences of δq between emergent vegetation and submerged vegetation were higher because the reflection volumes were reduced in submerged vegetation cases with increasing h fig 4b the hybrid structure of submerged vegetation moat and embankment from seaward which was the same structure of the highest δq in emergent vegetation cases showed the highest δq 3 1 1 3 hybrid system of landward vegetation type in all the hybrid systems of the landward vegetation type the embankment model was located closer to seaward than the vegetation model fig 1c the overflow volume depends on the position of the embankment and vegetation condition this is because after the flow overflowed the embankment model no reflected waves by the landward submerged vegetation model overtopped the embankment in the seaward direction therefore the differences of δq between emergent and submerged vegetation were extremely small fig 4c case mevs40 showed the highest δq in the submerged condition which was the same order of the structure that showed the highest δq in the emergent vegetation case mev40 3 1 1 4 hybrid system of center vegetation type the differences of δq between emergent and submerged vegetation cases changed depending on the location of the embankment model in this center vegetation type fig 4d the differences of δq between the seaward embankment type with submerged vegetation i e cases evs60 and ev60 and between evs40m and ev40m were small on the other hand case mvs40e was affected by the reflection by the moat and vegetation before overflowing from the embankment therefore there was a difference in δq between cases mv40e and mvs40e mvs40e showed the highest δq in the submerged condition which was the same order of structures that showed the highest δq in emergent vegetation mv40e 3 1 2 delay in tsunami arrival inland due to submerged or emergent hybrid defense system the delays in the tsunami arrival time at g3 were compared table 1 arrival times in the hybrid structures of seaward submerged vegetation cases cases vs40ne vs40me and vs40em were almost the same regardless of h case vs80 had a delayed tsunami arrival at g3 compared with the other hybrid defense system the differences between arrival times were 0 7 1 2s between emergent vegetation cases cases v40ne v40me and v40em and submerged vegetation cases cases vs40ne vs40me and vs40em when h 1 58 the difference in arrival time between emergent vegetation cases and submerged vegetation cases was 0 3 s in the landward vegetation type when h 1 58 the differences were smaller than those of the seaward vegetation type 0 7 1 2 s the effects of the height of vegetation and the differences of arrival time in landward vegetation types were small compared with those in seaward and center vegetation types due to the lower water level after overflowing from an embankment case evs60 delayed the tsunami arrival the most of the center vegetation types the difference of arrival times in the center vegetation type between emergent and submerged vegetation cases when h 1 58 was 0 6 s 3 1 3 effects on reduction of fluid force index and moment index fig 6 shows all results of rfi and rmi the fluid force index and moment index for all cases with an embankment could not be measured when h 0 81 because the water levels at g3 were beyond the measuring capacity of the flow velocity meter therefore the quantitative values are not shown but shown as nm in fig 6 3 1 3 1 comparison of rfi reduction rate of fluid force index rfi of the hybrid defense system of seaward vegetation type are shown in fig 6a1 rfi in the submerged condition became smaller than that in emergent condition because the flow velocity and the water level were increased in relation to the reduction of δq in the submerged condition and the fluid force index estimated at g3 was also increased case vs40me showed the highest rfi in submerged condition which was the same order as structures that showed the highest rfi in emergent vegetation case vs40em was remarkable fig 6a1 the rfi of the case was extremely low when h 1 58 related to this the time series of water levels and flow velocities at g3 are shown in fig 7 a focusing on the water level of case vs40em there were several times when the water level was higher than that in case nnn this is because the flow after overflowing from the embankment jumped diagonally along the landward slope of the moat and the water surface fluctuation became higher although this fluctuation was also observed in case v40em emergent vegetation the water level of case v40em was always smaller than that of case nnn due to the large reduction of overflowing discharge high δq the flow velocity in case vs40em was a little lower than case nnn because the water overflowing from the embankment immediately collided at the moat surface however the flow velocity in case vs40em became higher downstream than that in case nnn because the collision effect did not last and the flow slipped through the moat as a result the fluid force index was high and rfi became small rfi of all landward vegetation type hybrid defense models are shown in fig 6a2 the difference of rfi between the cases with emergent vegetation and submerged vegetation increased with increasing h this is because the difference of tree heights is larger with increasing tsunami height due to the increase of water level after overflowing from the embankment case emvs40 showed the highest rfi in the submerged condition and order of structures was the same as the case that showed the highest rfi in emergent vegetation rfi of all hybrid defense models with center type vegetation are shown in fig 6a3 rfi in case mvs40e was around half the value in case mv40e when h 1 58 because the flow velocity and water level were higher related to the reduction of δq on the other hand the differences of rfi in cases evs60 and evs40m compared with the emergent condition were smaller than those of seaward type vegetation because the tree resistance worked against the flow after overflowing from the embankment case evs40m showed the highest rfi in the submerged condition it was slightly different with the emergent vegetation cases where case ev60 showed the highest rfi however the effects of reducing the fluid force index in cases evs40m and evs60 were almost the same because the difference of rfi was extremely small related to fig 6a3 the time series data of water level and flow velocity are shown in fig 7b the timings when the fluid force index in case evs60 and evs40m took at maximum were 3 7 s and 3 5 s respectively the water level of case evs40m was higher than that of case evs60 because it jumped diagonally along the landward slope of the moat however the flow velocity of case evs60 was higher than that of case evs40m and the fluid force index of case evs60 was also higher than that of case evs40m there is a possibility that the collision effect reduced the flow velocity due to the reduction of the tree resistance in the submerged vegetation condition and the flow after overflowing from the embankment came to the moat faster rfi of case evs60 was closer to that of case evs40m when h 1 58 in this study however rfi of case evs40m would be higher than that of case evs60 because the collision effect would be strengthened in cases of h larger than 1 58 or lesser tree resistance 3 1 3 2 comparison of rmi reduction rate of moment index rmi of the hybrid defense system of seaward landward and center vegetation are shown in fig 6b1 b3 respectively the whole trend was very similar to that of rfi however the trend of rmi in the hybrid defense systems with the landward embankment was different from that of rfi the flow velocity was high but flow depth was low after overflowing from the embankment in these cases the fluid force index u 2 h was more affected by the increased flow velocity on the slope than the decreased water depth and thus rfi became small from the definition the moment index u 2 h 2 was affected by both high flow velocity and low flow depth and thus rmi did not become small just downstream of the embankment therefore they showed high rmi although rfi were low rmi of case vs40em showed a negative value when h 1 58 fig 6b1 in other words the maximum moment index of case vs40em became higher than that of case nnn cases vs40me emvs40 and evs40m showed the highest rmi in the submerged condition for seaward landward and central vegetation respectively from rmi the structures had the same order as those in seaward and landward vegetations in the emergent vegetation models the optimal structure was not the same as the central vegetation although the differences of rmi were not so large in the hybrid defense system with central vegetation 3 2 mitigation by combination of different height forest related to vegetation maintenance stage 3 2 1 differences of mitigation in vme cases δq rfi and rmi in vme cases cases v40me v20vs20me vs20v20me and vs40me and emv cases cases emv40 emv20vs20 emvs20v20 and emvs40 are shown in fig 8 a b and c respectively δq of vme cases which have emergent seaward vegetation are high regardless of h fig 8a1 related to this result photographs of the water gradient in vme cases when h 1 58 are shown in fig 9 the water gradient through the vegetation was steep in a v40me the water gradient of half the landward vegetation submerged in case of b v20vs20me was milder than that of a case v40me although the water gradient in v20 emergent in case of b v20vs20me was almost the same as that of a case v40me the δq was not large because the reflection of case v20vs20me to seaward was not much changed compared with a case v40me due to the similar water gradient on the other hand vs20 was submerged in c case vs20v20me the water gradient in v20 emergent became slightly steep although that of vs20 submerged was milder than in a v40me the reflected volume of vs20v20me was large and the δq is was also higher than that of case vs40me due to v20 emergent the water gradient of d case vs40me was milder than that of a case v40me these are caused by the difference of backwater rise in emergent or submerged vegetation moreover rfi and rmi show the same order of higher δq lower overflow volume in case vme fig 8b1 c1 3 2 2 difference of mitigation in cases of emv type there were no differences of δq in emv cases because they have a seaward embankment fig 8a2 case emvs20v20 showed a higher rfi and rmi than case emv20vs20 fig 8b2 and 8c2 the photographs of the flow after overflowing the embankment in cases emv20vs20 and emvs20v20 are shown in fig 10 after overflowing the embankment the flow jumped diagonally along with the landward slope of the moat and the water level increased in front of the vegetation model due to the tree resistance fig 10a immediately after a hydraulic jump occurred between the moat and vegetation emv20vs20 b and emvs20v20 c more water was stored temporarily between the moat and emergent vegetation in case emv20vs20 fig 10b than case emvs20v20 because the intense flow after overflowing the embankment was reflected by the emergent vegetation immediately after that the stored water and the flow coming from the embankment merged and increased in intensity therefore in some instances the fluid force index and moment index in case emv20vs20 became higher than those in case emvs20v20 as a result the differences of fluid force index and moment index rfi and rmi respectively in case emv20vs20 were lower than those of case emvs20v20 4 discussion 4 1 optimal hybrid structures composed of artificial structures and emergent or submerged vegetation for tsunami mitigation from points of different indices the effectiveness was evaluated using the four evaluation indices shown in table 2 in the table the first second and third most effective structures are indicated as a double circle circle and triangle respectively this study with submerged vegetation cases can summarize case vs40me case evs60 and case emvs40 as the optimal hybrid structures of δq arrival time and rfi and rmi respectively in emergent cases zaha et al 2019 case v40me and case emv40 were selected as the optimal hybrid structure for δq and arrival time and rfi and rmi respectively the optimal structures are the same for δq rfi and rmi although the difference between this study and zaha et al 2019 is the height of the tree models in case vs40me the flow was reflected by the seaward vegetation the incoming water volume to the moat was reduced and the landward slope of the moat and embankment further reflected the current then the reduction of overtopping δq in case vs40me was higher than in cases vs40ne and vs40em because of the combination of moat and embankment however the flow velocity was accelerated and fluid force index was increased once the flow overflowed the embankment because the case has a landward embankment a similar study by igarashi and tanaka 2018 with the combination of vegetation and embankment showed that the fluid force index was high in the order of vegetation and embankment from seaward the study also showed that the case mostly reduced the overflow water volume and effectively reduced the inundation area considering the discussion the hybrid defense system of vegetation moat and embankment from seaward would be effective to reduce the inundation area and inundation depth behind where residential areas including wooden building exist collision at the moat dissipated more energy after overflowing the embankment in case emvs40 due to the higher head difference compared to case envs40 after passing the moat the water level in front of the vegetation was increased and the flow velocity through the vegetation was reduced by the tree resistance followed by a hydraulic jump between the moat and front vegetation thus emvs40 reduced the fluid force index and moment index of the landward vegetation type the most this structure did not effectively reduce the overflow water volume compared with the seaward vegetation type but it did effectively reduce the fluid force index and moment index after overflowing the embankment by a series of mitigation mechanisms the reduction in fluid force and the moment by fluid force can decrease the area of damage to houses as an optimal structure arrival time shows only one difference in between emergent and submerged vegetation conditions the hybrid structures that delayed the flow were case v40me and case evs60 in emergent and submerged vegetation conditions respectively in the emergent vegetation case the reflection by seaward vegetation effectively reduced the incoming flow volume to landward in case v40me in addition to this the tree resistance delayed the flow arriving at g3 by these mechanisms case v40me most delayed the flow arrival in the emergent condition however in submerged vegetation cases the reflection seaward was comparatively reduced due to the reduction of seaward vegetation resistance therefore the delay effect was smaller than that in the emergent condition the delay effect by seaward vegetation is related to the reduction of incoming water volume by the combination of vegetation and embankment thus it becomes smaller with the condition of high tsunami where vegetation is submerged from this study for a countermeasure focusing only on the delay in tsunami arrival time utilizing limited land space the expansion of vegetation longitudinally case evs60 and vs80 was effective to delay the arrival of a large tsunami in which trees become submerged 4 2 implication on renewal of forest in hybrid structure as already explained considering the cases where part of the vegetation of the proposed hybrid type should be harvested or renewed the mixed vegetation cases of v20 and vs20 were conducted and the indices are listed in tables 1 and 3 table 3 does not show the optimal structure but visualizes the mitigation effect by changing vegetation resistance related to renewal e δq was reduced in vme cases because the reflection decreased due to the reduction of vegetation resistance and the overflow water volume increased related to this the delay effect became smaller and fluid force and moment by fluid force became higher and then e at e rfi and e rmi were reduced however case v20vs20me shows the closer mitigation effect in case v40me even when h 1 58 in this study case vs20v20me shows a higher mitigation effect than case vs40me in emv cases e δq showed values close to each other because overflow water volumes were almost the same in the landward vegetation cases the fluid force index and moment index were changed depending on the vegetation arrangement rashedunnabi et al 2019 showed the mitigation effect of the combination of an embankment with a landward horizontally double layer forest in the steady flow condition this study also used the horizontally double layer forest model such as vs40v40 in this study however submerged vegetation gives higher resistance than emergent vegetation because the density of submerged vegetation is larger than that of emergent vegetation which can apply to the actual case the study shows that the order of effectiveness that can reduce the energy behind their structures is case eftt case efst case efts and case en e embankment f forest vegetation subscripts s and t shows submerged and emergent condition and the order shows the structure from seaward the energy head in case efts became higher than in case efst because the water gradient through the vegetation in case efts was steeper flow velocity in upper zone of submerged vegetation was supposed to be higher and thus the resistance by submerged vegetation became relatively smaller in this study the water gradient through the vegetation in case emv20vs20 was steeper than that in case emvs20v20 shown in fig 10 and the fluid force index and moment index at g3 in case emv20vs20 were higher than those in case emvs20v20 in which the density of submerged vegetation was the same as that of emergent vegetation both studies showed similar structures concerned with tsunami mitigation effects that focused on the vegetation behind an embankment although the experimental conditions were largely different in their study and the results cannot be compared simply therefore the combination of vs20 and v20 behind an embankment was examined for not only the initial dense rashedunnabi et al 2019 but also long term vegetation conditions considering self thinning or thinning management igarashi et al 2019 this vegetation type grows naturally in the area where the sea wind is strong and it is easily included as a part of coastal defense system harada and kawata 2005 conducted a numerical simulation for elucidating the tsunami mitigation function of a coastal forest focusing on the tree height and tree density the study showed that the lower tree crown height reduced the run up height on a slope because the crown gives larger resistance to a tsunami than the tree trunk igarashi et al 2019 considered tree thinning by changing the tree density and tree standing structures tree trunk diameter tree height crown height and width etc by modelling the tree dahurian larch larix gmelinii breaking by the external force of a tsunami in the study the forest with high tree density and relatively smaller tree height reduced the fluid force index more behind the vegetation compared with the structure after thinning management further when the trees are young the trees are overturned tanaka et al 2013 2018 and can provide resistance even after the tree breaks when half the vegetation is renewed as in case v20vs20me it can mitigate the tsunami effectively in the seaward vegetation type because the water gradient through the seaward vegetation v20 is steep and the water level in the landward vegetation vs20 is low on the other hand in the landward type case emvs20v20 was effective although the renewal was modelled by changing tree height in this study the tree crown height and density not considered in the physical model were important parameters for tsunami mitigation by vegetation according to noarayanan et al 2012 the resistance can be changed by the vegetation parameters i e the length of the vegetation the ratio of the vegetation spacing and diameter of the vegetation sp d and the vegetation flow parameter vfp which includes the parameters of structural rigidity of vegetal stems green belt and flow parameters although these parameters were not changed systematically in this study however the optimal conditions of vegetation itself are needed to be discussed for further improving the mitigation effects by the vegetation therefore further experiments and numerical simulations are needed to generalize the mitigation effects of vegetation in hybrid structures in terms of vegetation maintenance with changing tree crown height vegetation density and vfp 5 summary and conclusions the differences between hybrid defenses utilizing vegetation were compared between submerged this study and emergent conditions zaha et al 2019 especially the differences of tsunami mitigation effects by seaward vegetation became smaller than those in any other type because reflected waves were weakened in relation to the reduction by vegetation resistance in the submerged condition the optimal structures are discussed utilizing four indices δq arrival time rfi and rmi in the submerged condition obtained from this experiment the optimal hybrid structure of δq arrival time and rfi and rmi for seaward center and landward vegetation types are case vs40me case evs60 and case emvs40 respectively for δq and rfi and rmi the optimal structure was the same with that in emergent condition zaha et al 2019 in case vs40me the flow was reflected by the seaward vegetation the incoming water volume to the moat was reduced and the landward slope of the moat and embankment further reflected the current and thus the reduction of overflowing water volume δq was the highest in case emvs40 collision at the moat dissipated more energy after overflowing the embankment after passing the moat the water level in front of the vegetation was increased and the flow velocity through the vegetation was reduced by the tree resistance then case emvs40 mostly reduced the fluid force index and moment index of the landward type the expansion of vegetation longitudinally case evs60 was effective to delay the tsunami arrival against the large tsunami where trees become submerged the change in tsunami mitigation effects by the vegetation renewal was demonstrated in vme and emv which were optimal in this series of experiments the results of δq rfi and rmi show that the mitigation effects were in between emergent and submerged conditions however the numerical simulations including the resistance of the tree crown and tree breaking to the tsunami external force are needed to generalize the mitigation effect of hybrid system utilizing vegetation credit authorship contribution statement yuya kimiwada investigation writing original draft

21816,a hybrid tsunami defense system comprising vegetation v an embankment e and a moat m while changing the order of the components and the inundation depth of vegetation was investigated in a flume using a surge type flow produced by quickly lifting a gate compared with the hybrid defense system in which vegetation is emergent the tsunami mitigation effects of seaward vegetation became smaller than the other types because the reflections were weakened by the reduction of vegetation resistance in the submerged condition based on the decrease in overflow volume fluid force and moment by fluid force the optimal structures of seaward and landward submerged vegetation types were the same order of v m and e vme type and e m and v emv type from seaward respectively as those in the emergent condition differences in tsunami mitigation effects due to vegetation renewal were demonstrated in vme and emv types by changing the horizontal vegetation structure although the mitigation effects of horizontally combined types were in between emergent and submerged conditions the water surface gradient behind the forest which is related to erosion and driftwood production showed a clear difference in the order of submerged and emergent vegetation keywords energy reduction hydraulic jump vegetation resistance fluid force overflow volume 1 introduction the 2011 great east japan tsunami gejt greatly exceeded the disaster prevention capacity of the existing sea embankment and caused great damage to forests and properties in the hinterland of the coastal area tappin et al 2012 tanaka 2012 after the gejt the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism of japan mlit classified tsunamis into two categories level 1 disaster prevention level in which the recurrent period is less than around a hundred years and level 2 disaster mitigation level in which the recurrent period is several hundred to a thousand years because the current embankment height was designed for a level 1 tsunami a disaster mitigation method for a level 2 tsunami needs to be developed igarashi and tanaka 2018 zaha et al 2019 although the tsunami mitigation functions of a coastal forest by energy reduction and trapping floating debris were widely recognized in previous studies shuto 1987 hiraishi and harada 2003 harada and imamura 2006 irtem et al 2009 iimura and tanaka 2012 nandasena et al 2012 pasha and tanaka 2017 parts of forests were destroyed in the 2004 indian ocean tsunami iot and 2011 gejt and their effectiveness was largely reduced by the destruction tanaka et al 2013 2014 in extreme hazards a natural system sometimes loses its function due to its destruction so natural plus built infrastructures hybrid approaches are recommended to enhance the coastal resilience in the protection from storm and coastal flooding tanaka et al 2014 sutton grier et al 2015 recently studies on compound or hybrid defense systems against a tsunami have been conducted i e a sea embankment combined with a coastal forest tanaka et al 2014 igarashi and tanaka 2018 rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 a moat with without a forest usman et al 2014 a moat or canal behind an embankment mineura et al 2013 tokida and tanimoto 2014 tsujimoto et al 2014 rahman et al 2017 and a double embankment system tanaka and igarashi 2016 usman et al 2014 demonstrated numerically that a hybrid system comprised of a forest with inland moats could effectively reduce the inundation depth and flow velocity usman et al 2014 for adapting the hybrid defense systems in a coastal environment the effects of tsunami mitigation need to be quantified under various tsunami heights forest conditions tree density tree height etc and their interactions emergent or submerged vegetation condition after the gejt a defense system that strengthens the disaster mitigation function of existing coastal forests by combining them with a moat and an embankment hybrid system was proposed hfs 2016 and constructed in shiranuka town hokkaido prefecture for a future level 2 tsunami according to the forest type where available land exists on seaward landward or both sides of the forest the optimal type was examined experimentally when the forest is not damaged and in an emergent condition through the mechanisms by which a hybrid defense system decreases the tsunami energy in relation to the physical phenomenon i e increasing the reflection effect utilizing a hydraulic jump zaha et al 2019 however information on the role of a submerged forest in the hybrid system is not adequate to fully understand and utilize the tsunami mitigation ability of the proposed system because trees may be broken in a large tsunami and its effects are reduced when the forest becomes submerged tanaka et al 2018 the submerged condition can be assumed when the tsunami height is large and tree height is small due to exposure to strong salt spray or recent planting sometimes in an updated condition or trees are bent by the destructive force the relationship between forest management and wind damage has been assessed and the resistance and damage are dependent on the tree species and stand structures peltola et al 1999 gardiner et al 2000 meanwhile the development of coastal forest management techniques against tsunamis is delayed due to the low frequency of tsunamis when compared with wind damage torita et al 2018 forest management for tsunami mitigation was discussed in previous studies paying attention to the differences of tree species and tree crown heights in numerical simulations harada and kawata 2005 tanaka et al 2018 various tree stand characteristics torita and tanaka 2018 and changes in tree density and stand structures by tree thinning igarashi et al 2019 however the effects of harvesting for renewal of a forest were not discussed in previous research the relationship between forest management and the change of effectiveness in a hybrid system was not clearly elucidated although zaha et al 2019 conducted experimental study and clarified the effectiveness of the optimal hybrid defense structures with the emergent vegetation condition however the vegetation characteristics are changed with their growth and the management harada and kawata 2005 igarashi et al 2019 in addition the effectiveness itself has also a possibility to be changed therefore the objective of this study was to clarify the tsunami mitigation effects of hybrid defense systems in the scenarios of zaha et al 2019 where there is constructible land seaward landward or on both sides of a coastal forest by changing the forest condition from emergent to submerged or a mixed condition of submergence using a flume that can produce a surge type flow the mitigation effects of each combination model in the submerged condition were compared paying special attention to the reflection transmission hydraulic jump and vegetation resistance and to differences with the previous emergent vegetation cases zaha et al 2019 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus and procedures this study used the same facility and similar hydraulic conditions reported by zaha et al 2019 i e a flume 1800 cm in length and 40 cm in width that can generate a surge type flow by quickly lifting a gate fig 1 a and b a constant bed slope of 1 10 was set from 450 to 505 cm downstream from the gate and the hybrid design model was laid after 505 cm in a horizontal bed the physical scale of the model was set at 1 100 considering the scale of the wave flume and froude similarity was applied an incoming surge type flow was generated by setting the still water depth at hs 5 5 cm and the tank water depth at ht 15 20 or 25 cm although it is a little difficult to make a 1 h wave period tsunami on an actual scale eight separate tsunami waves were recorded in around 28 min around 200 s per tsunami wave by a gps wave gauge at the northern part of iwate prefecture off the coast of kuji in the 2011 gejt tanaka et al 2016 the wave period of this study and that of zaha et al 2019 was 150 s in actual scale 15 s in model scale using the froude similarity law that is similar to the high frequency mode of the tsunami at the 2011 gejt in addition although the tsunami height at the coast can be set at around 1 2 times the embankment height 5 10 m in actual scale a level 2 tsunami in hokkaido is assumed to be around 2 35 m high hfs 2016 thus the experiment did not cover all level 2 tsunami cases although the period and wave height were slightly small and did not fully cover the range this study aimed to mitigate the first wave inundation mainly for evacuation purposes like zaha et al 2019 however a large flume experiment or numerical simulations are needed in the future for elucidating the longer wave period and larger wave height effects a moat and an embankment model were built using wooden boards as shown in fig 1 as was discussed in zaha et al 2019 most of the tsunami affected black pine trees maintained resistance even when the trees were overturned at the 2011 gejt and the crown height of pine trees in sendai plain was high tanaka et al 2014 the diameter of tree trunks at breast height tree height and tree density were 0 2 0 5 m 18 m and 0 20 trees m2 respectively tanaka et al 2013 in the previous research studies trees have been commonly replicated using vertical cylinders of a stiff material e g noarayanan et al 2012 pasha and tanaka 2017 therefore for the tree models circular wooden cylinders were selected and the modulus of elasticity moe of tree models in this study was considered around 16000 mpa the same igarashi and tanaka 2018 considering the real scale the diameter d height spacing sp and density of the wooden cylinders used in this experiment were scaled down to 0 4 cm 18 cm 1 9 cm and 0 22 cylinders cm2 respectively the length of the vegetation models for 40 60 and 80 rows were 80 120 and 160 cm respectively and the vegetation cylinders were arranged in a staggered pattern in addition the height of the submerged vegetation was set at 3 cm assuming that the trees of that same height as the embankment were overturned or that tree height was small because of the strong salt spray or trees were young after planting 2 1 1 experimental condition as shown in fig 1c to clarify the effects of the different hybrid defense systems on tsunami mitigation the orders of the submerged type vegetation moat and embankment were adjusted as well as the number of rows used in the vegetation model for expressing the respective cases in this study n vs e and m were used to represent no system submerged vegetation embankment and moat respectively subscripts of vs indicate the number of vegetation rows the vegetation length was set to be similar to the embankment and moat scale to discuss the optimal arrangement for strengthening the existing forest under limited land conditions the vegetation model had three types based on the number of rows 40 60 and 80 rows for submerged models vs40 vs60 and vs80 and emergent models v40 v60 and v80 zaha et al 2019 respectively the case names were combined in the order of the model arrangement from seaward to landward for example vs40em means the model was set in the order of 40 rows of submerged vegetation an embankment and a moat from the seaward case nnn was considered to be the control experiment for clarifying the reflection from slope component itself for generating a wave the initial hydrostatic depth on the downstream side of the flume gate hs was set at 5 5 cm the initial tank water depths from the still water depth were set to 15 20 and 25 cm respectively for each run ht a bore type flow was generated by quickly lifting the gate the gate used in this study can be lifted up to 15 20 and 25 cm in 0 384 0 512 and 0 640 s respectively with the operating air pressure of 0 65 mpa the froude numbers were estimated as 1 55 1 79 and 2 03 when the tank water depths ht were 15 20 and 25 cm respectively three wave gauges tokyo keisoku company ltd hat 106 hat 30 g1 g2 and g3 were set at 400 507 and 698 cm from the gate respectively for each hybrid model case the average of three runs data was calculated the fixed bed height of the hybrid model 5 5 cm was subtracted from the average of the maximum water level at g2 h g2 max and the maximum wave height h max of the measurement point at g2 was calculated reflection seaward and transmission landward were greatly affected by the non dimensional wave height h calculated by dividing the maximum wave height by the embankment height z e in eq 1 zaha et al 2019 the h that corresponded to the tank water depths of 15 20 and 25 cm were 0 81 1 23 and 1 58 respectively even when there was no embankment in the model the h for the same tank water depth was used for comparing the differences of the models 1 h h m a x z e 2 2 parameters for evaluating effectiveness of each hybrid system for comparing the effectiveness of each hybrid model the same indices as the previous study zaha et al 2019 i e the reflected wave from the model delay in tsunami arrival time overflow volume from the embankment and fluid force index u 2 h where u is the velocity and h is the water depth and moment index u 2 h 2 were used in this study 2 2 1 overflow volume from embankment a retention pool was set behind the hybrid system landward to measure the overflow volume from the embankment in each case fig 1 the overflow volume was estimated using the relationship between the pool water depth and the water volume even in the no embankment case overflow volume was calculated for comparison using the measured flow volume after passing through the vegetation model the rate of reduction of overflow volume δq from the embankment was calculated from eq 2 and the effect on overflow volume in each experimental case was compared using 2 q q n n n q q n n n 100 where q nnn is defined as the overflow volume for case nnn and q is defined in each model case a higher δq means a higher rate of reduction of the overflow volume and shows higher effectiveness of the hybrid system 2 2 2 fluid force index and moment index the fluid force index u 2 h and the moment index u 2 h 2 were used for evaluating destruction of a house tanaka et al 2014 for evaluating the effectiveness of each hybrid system the water depth h at g3 was measured and the flow velocity u at 695 cm from the gate was measured by a laser doppler velocity meter kanomax smart ldvii because it was difficult to measure flow velocity and water depth at the same point the maximum reduction rates of the fluid force index and the moment index were defined as rfi and rmi respectively by eq 3 and eq 4 3 r f i u 2 h n n n u 2 h max u 2 h n n n 100 4 r m i u 2 h 2 n n n u 2 h 2 m a x u 2 h 2 n n n 100 where u 2 h nnn u 2 h 2 nnn u 2 h max and u 2 h 2 max are defined as the maximum values of the fluid force index and moment index the subscripts nnn and max represent the maximum value without a model case case nnn and the maximum value in each model case respectively the higher rfi and rmi are the larger reduction of the fluid force index and the moment index and thus show the effectiveness of the hybrid system for comparing the differences of δq rfi and rmi for each hybrid system an embankment only case case e and a moat only case case m were tested in zaha et al 2019 as shown in table 1 this study used the results for the estimation of eqs 2 4 2 2 3 delay in tsunami arrival time the time series of the water levels after the arrival of the wave at g1 was measured at g3 for evaluating the delay in tsunami arrival time 2 2 4 reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient wave reflection and transmission characteristics were analyzed using the reflection coefficient c r and transmission coefficient c t as 5 c r h r h i 6 c t h t h i where h i is the maximum flow depth at g1 for the case without a slope when there was no slope as well as no hybrid defense system h r is the maximum measured flow depth at g1 with a slope and hybrid system and h t is the maximum measured flow depth at g3 with a slope and hybrid system in general c r and c t were evaluated without a slope huang et al 2011 however this study considered the slope effect as well c r and c t of case nnn which had only the slope in h 0 81 1 23 1 58 were 1 36 1 32 1 33 and 0 69 0 67 0 69 respectively due to the superposition of the coming wave and the reflected wave caused by the slope in case nnn h r was greater than h i and thus c r became greater than 1 wave characteristics is also different with the study of huang et al 2011 in which they conducted experiments using the solitary waves this study used the bore type flow as shown in fig 2 2 2 5 total indices for discussing optimal conditions for discussing the total effectiveness of each hybrid system the four evaluation indices below were as defined by zaha et al 2019 because the order of the effectiveness was changed with h 7 e δ q i 1 3 h δ q a i i 1 3 h i 8 e a t i 1 2 h a t a a t n n n a i i 1 2 h i 9 e r f i i 1 2 h r f i a i i 1 2 h i 10 e r m i i 1 2 h r m i a i i 1 2 h i where e q e at e rfi and e rmi are the evaluation indices for δq arrival time rfi and rmi respectively and where subscript a means the average value for each model and wave height at nnna and at a mean the average arrival time for the control case nnn and each hybrid model respectively for the summation σ i should be from 1 to 3 three wave heights however in all cases with the embankment and h 0 81 arrival time rfi and rmi could not be measured therefore e at e rfi and e rmi were only estimated for wave height h 1 23 and 1 58 and thus i is only from 1 to 2 for eqs 8 10 3 results the indices defined in the previous section c r c t δq rfi and rmi were estimated and compared to select an optimal hybrid system for submerged vegetation cases table 1 standard deviations sd of δq rfi and rmi are mostly far smaller than the differences in the cases although the quantitative values were different the tendencies of the indices were similar to those shown in zaha et al 2019 c r and c t are shown in fig 3 the results show that c r is always greater than 1 because of the reason that the flow depths were increased due to the superposition of the coming wave and the reflected wave caused by the slope and hybrid structures as compared to the case without a slope therefore the sum of c r and c t was not equal to or less than unity in this study when the reflection seaward increased c r and c t took larger and smaller values respectively and δq increased overflow volume decreased therefore c r and δq showed similar trends and c t and δq showed opposite trends within each vegetation type 3 1 effects of submerged hybrid systems 3 1 1 comparison of δq reduction rate of overflow volume 3 1 1 1 single structures δq of single structures are shown in fig 4 a the δq of all the single structures got smaller with increasing h because the reflection coefficient c r decreased accordingly table 1 when the tsunami water depth became high the ratio of the tree resistance against the tsunami fluid force was relatively low this is because the resistance is associated with the cylinder drag which exists only within the height of a cylinder in the submerged condition δq of submerged vegetation cases were reduced to around 16 in 40 rows cases vs40nn nnvs40 and nvs40n and 23 in 80 rows case vs80 which were smaller than the emergent cases 40 47 in 40 rows cases v40nn nnv40 and nv40n and 56 in 80 rows case v80 3 1 1 2 hybrid system hs of seaward vegetation type the difference between δq of the seaward vegetation cases with emergent and submerged conditions became higher with increasing h as shown in fig 4b this was mainly caused by the difference of reflected waves to seaward fig 5 shows the time series of water levels at g1 when h 1 58 in cases vs40nn vs80 vs40ne vs40me and vs40em which have a seaward vegetation model the differences between the hybrid defense systems of a landward vegetation type and a center vegetation type are not shown because they were small in the reflected waves of the emergent and submerged vegetation the solid lines show the data for emergent vegetation cases zaha et al 2019 and the dotted lines show those for submerged vegetation cases this study the increase in water levels from 0 s to 2 s a and from 2 s to 3 s b were due to the waves arriving at g1 and the waves reflected by the slope respectively waves reflected by the vegetation model start from 3 s the waves reflected by the embankment started from 5 5 s in cases vs40ne vs40me and vs40em water levels of the cases of submerged vegetation with the embankment at g1 were almost the same with those of emergent vegetation cases after 6 s water levels of submerged vegetation cases were always smaller than those of emergent vegetation cases between the start of waves reflected by the vegetation and the start of those by the embankment 3 0 s 6 0 s moreover with increasing h c r of cases vs40ne vs40me and vs40em this study became smaller however those of cases v40ne v40me and v40em zaha et al 2019 became bigger table 1 in other words the differences of δq between emergent vegetation and submerged vegetation were higher because the reflection volumes were reduced in submerged vegetation cases with increasing h fig 4b the hybrid structure of submerged vegetation moat and embankment from seaward which was the same structure of the highest δq in emergent vegetation cases showed the highest δq 3 1 1 3 hybrid system of landward vegetation type in all the hybrid systems of the landward vegetation type the embankment model was located closer to seaward than the vegetation model fig 1c the overflow volume depends on the position of the embankment and vegetation condition this is because after the flow overflowed the embankment model no reflected waves by the landward submerged vegetation model overtopped the embankment in the seaward direction therefore the differences of δq between emergent and submerged vegetation were extremely small fig 4c case mevs40 showed the highest δq in the submerged condition which was the same order of the structure that showed the highest δq in the emergent vegetation case mev40 3 1 1 4 hybrid system of center vegetation type the differences of δq between emergent and submerged vegetation cases changed depending on the location of the embankment model in this center vegetation type fig 4d the differences of δq between the seaward embankment type with submerged vegetation i e cases evs60 and ev60 and between evs40m and ev40m were small on the other hand case mvs40e was affected by the reflection by the moat and vegetation before overflowing from the embankment therefore there was a difference in δq between cases mv40e and mvs40e mvs40e showed the highest δq in the submerged condition which was the same order of structures that showed the highest δq in emergent vegetation mv40e 3 1 2 delay in tsunami arrival inland due to submerged or emergent hybrid defense system the delays in the tsunami arrival time at g3 were compared table 1 arrival times in the hybrid structures of seaward submerged vegetation cases cases vs40ne vs40me and vs40em were almost the same regardless of h case vs80 had a delayed tsunami arrival at g3 compared with the other hybrid defense system the differences between arrival times were 0 7 1 2s between emergent vegetation cases cases v40ne v40me and v40em and submerged vegetation cases cases vs40ne vs40me and vs40em when h 1 58 the difference in arrival time between emergent vegetation cases and submerged vegetation cases was 0 3 s in the landward vegetation type when h 1 58 the differences were smaller than those of the seaward vegetation type 0 7 1 2 s the effects of the height of vegetation and the differences of arrival time in landward vegetation types were small compared with those in seaward and center vegetation types due to the lower water level after overflowing from an embankment case evs60 delayed the tsunami arrival the most of the center vegetation types the difference of arrival times in the center vegetation type between emergent and submerged vegetation cases when h 1 58 was 0 6 s 3 1 3 effects on reduction of fluid force index and moment index fig 6 shows all results of rfi and rmi the fluid force index and moment index for all cases with an embankment could not be measured when h 0 81 because the water levels at g3 were beyond the measuring capacity of the flow velocity meter therefore the quantitative values are not shown but shown as nm in fig 6 3 1 3 1 comparison of rfi reduction rate of fluid force index rfi of the hybrid defense system of seaward vegetation type are shown in fig 6a1 rfi in the submerged condition became smaller than that in emergent condition because the flow velocity and the water level were increased in relation to the reduction of δq in the submerged condition and the fluid force index estimated at g3 was also increased case vs40me showed the highest rfi in submerged condition which was the same order as structures that showed the highest rfi in emergent vegetation case vs40em was remarkable fig 6a1 the rfi of the case was extremely low when h 1 58 related to this the time series of water levels and flow velocities at g3 are shown in fig 7 a focusing on the water level of case vs40em there were several times when the water level was higher than that in case nnn this is because the flow after overflowing from the embankment jumped diagonally along the landward slope of the moat and the water surface fluctuation became higher although this fluctuation was also observed in case v40em emergent vegetation the water level of case v40em was always smaller than that of case nnn due to the large reduction of overflowing discharge high δq the flow velocity in case vs40em was a little lower than case nnn because the water overflowing from the embankment immediately collided at the moat surface however the flow velocity in case vs40em became higher downstream than that in case nnn because the collision effect did not last and the flow slipped through the moat as a result the fluid force index was high and rfi became small rfi of all landward vegetation type hybrid defense models are shown in fig 6a2 the difference of rfi between the cases with emergent vegetation and submerged vegetation increased with increasing h this is because the difference of tree heights is larger with increasing tsunami height due to the increase of water level after overflowing from the embankment case emvs40 showed the highest rfi in the submerged condition and order of structures was the same as the case that showed the highest rfi in emergent vegetation rfi of all hybrid defense models with center type vegetation are shown in fig 6a3 rfi in case mvs40e was around half the value in case mv40e when h 1 58 because the flow velocity and water level were higher related to the reduction of δq on the other hand the differences of rfi in cases evs60 and evs40m compared with the emergent condition were smaller than those of seaward type vegetation because the tree resistance worked against the flow after overflowing from the embankment case evs40m showed the highest rfi in the submerged condition it was slightly different with the emergent vegetation cases where case ev60 showed the highest rfi however the effects of reducing the fluid force index in cases evs40m and evs60 were almost the same because the difference of rfi was extremely small related to fig 6a3 the time series data of water level and flow velocity are shown in fig 7b the timings when the fluid force index in case evs60 and evs40m took at maximum were 3 7 s and 3 5 s respectively the water level of case evs40m was higher than that of case evs60 because it jumped diagonally along the landward slope of the moat however the flow velocity of case evs60 was higher than that of case evs40m and the fluid force index of case evs60 was also higher than that of case evs40m there is a possibility that the collision effect reduced the flow velocity due to the reduction of the tree resistance in the submerged vegetation condition and the flow after overflowing from the embankment came to the moat faster rfi of case evs60 was closer to that of case evs40m when h 1 58 in this study however rfi of case evs40m would be higher than that of case evs60 because the collision effect would be strengthened in cases of h larger than 1 58 or lesser tree resistance 3 1 3 2 comparison of rmi reduction rate of moment index rmi of the hybrid defense system of seaward landward and center vegetation are shown in fig 6b1 b3 respectively the whole trend was very similar to that of rfi however the trend of rmi in the hybrid defense systems with the landward embankment was different from that of rfi the flow velocity was high but flow depth was low after overflowing from the embankment in these cases the fluid force index u 2 h was more affected by the increased flow velocity on the slope than the decreased water depth and thus rfi became small from the definition the moment index u 2 h 2 was affected by both high flow velocity and low flow depth and thus rmi did not become small just downstream of the embankment therefore they showed high rmi although rfi were low rmi of case vs40em showed a negative value when h 1 58 fig 6b1 in other words the maximum moment index of case vs40em became higher than that of case nnn cases vs40me emvs40 and evs40m showed the highest rmi in the submerged condition for seaward landward and central vegetation respectively from rmi the structures had the same order as those in seaward and landward vegetations in the emergent vegetation models the optimal structure was not the same as the central vegetation although the differences of rmi were not so large in the hybrid defense system with central vegetation 3 2 mitigation by combination of different height forest related to vegetation maintenance stage 3 2 1 differences of mitigation in vme cases δq rfi and rmi in vme cases cases v40me v20vs20me vs20v20me and vs40me and emv cases cases emv40 emv20vs20 emvs20v20 and emvs40 are shown in fig 8 a b and c respectively δq of vme cases which have emergent seaward vegetation are high regardless of h fig 8a1 related to this result photographs of the water gradient in vme cases when h 1 58 are shown in fig 9 the water gradient through the vegetation was steep in a v40me the water gradient of half the landward vegetation submerged in case of b v20vs20me was milder than that of a case v40me although the water gradient in v20 emergent in case of b v20vs20me was almost the same as that of a case v40me the δq was not large because the reflection of case v20vs20me to seaward was not much changed compared with a case v40me due to the similar water gradient on the other hand vs20 was submerged in c case vs20v20me the water gradient in v20 emergent became slightly steep although that of vs20 submerged was milder than in a v40me the reflected volume of vs20v20me was large and the δq is was also higher than that of case vs40me due to v20 emergent the water gradient of d case vs40me was milder than that of a case v40me these are caused by the difference of backwater rise in emergent or submerged vegetation moreover rfi and rmi show the same order of higher δq lower overflow volume in case vme fig 8b1 c1 3 2 2 difference of mitigation in cases of emv type there were no differences of δq in emv cases because they have a seaward embankment fig 8a2 case emvs20v20 showed a higher rfi and rmi than case emv20vs20 fig 8b2 and 8c2 the photographs of the flow after overflowing the embankment in cases emv20vs20 and emvs20v20 are shown in fig 10 after overflowing the embankment the flow jumped diagonally along with the landward slope of the moat and the water level increased in front of the vegetation model due to the tree resistance fig 10a immediately after a hydraulic jump occurred between the moat and vegetation emv20vs20 b and emvs20v20 c more water was stored temporarily between the moat and emergent vegetation in case emv20vs20 fig 10b than case emvs20v20 because the intense flow after overflowing the embankment was reflected by the emergent vegetation immediately after that the stored water and the flow coming from the embankment merged and increased in intensity therefore in some instances the fluid force index and moment index in case emv20vs20 became higher than those in case emvs20v20 as a result the differences of fluid force index and moment index rfi and rmi respectively in case emv20vs20 were lower than those of case emvs20v20 4 discussion 4 1 optimal hybrid structures composed of artificial structures and emergent or submerged vegetation for tsunami mitigation from points of different indices the effectiveness was evaluated using the four evaluation indices shown in table 2 in the table the first second and third most effective structures are indicated as a double circle circle and triangle respectively this study with submerged vegetation cases can summarize case vs40me case evs60 and case emvs40 as the optimal hybrid structures of δq arrival time and rfi and rmi respectively in emergent cases zaha et al 2019 case v40me and case emv40 were selected as the optimal hybrid structure for δq and arrival time and rfi and rmi respectively the optimal structures are the same for δq rfi and rmi although the difference between this study and zaha et al 2019 is the height of the tree models in case vs40me the flow was reflected by the seaward vegetation the incoming water volume to the moat was reduced and the landward slope of the moat and embankment further reflected the current then the reduction of overtopping δq in case vs40me was higher than in cases vs40ne and vs40em because of the combination of moat and embankment however the flow velocity was accelerated and fluid force index was increased once the flow overflowed the embankment because the case has a landward embankment a similar study by igarashi and tanaka 2018 with the combination of vegetation and embankment showed that the fluid force index was high in the order of vegetation and embankment from seaward the study also showed that the case mostly reduced the overflow water volume and effectively reduced the inundation area considering the discussion the hybrid defense system of vegetation moat and embankment from seaward would be effective to reduce the inundation area and inundation depth behind where residential areas including wooden building exist collision at the moat dissipated more energy after overflowing the embankment in case emvs40 due to the higher head difference compared to case envs40 after passing the moat the water level in front of the vegetation was increased and the flow velocity through the vegetation was reduced by the tree resistance followed by a hydraulic jump between the moat and front vegetation thus emvs40 reduced the fluid force index and moment index of the landward vegetation type the most this structure did not effectively reduce the overflow water volume compared with the seaward vegetation type but it did effectively reduce the fluid force index and moment index after overflowing the embankment by a series of mitigation mechanisms the reduction in fluid force and the moment by fluid force can decrease the area of damage to houses as an optimal structure arrival time shows only one difference in between emergent and submerged vegetation conditions the hybrid structures that delayed the flow were case v40me and case evs60 in emergent and submerged vegetation conditions respectively in the emergent vegetation case the reflection by seaward vegetation effectively reduced the incoming flow volume to landward in case v40me in addition to this the tree resistance delayed the flow arriving at g3 by these mechanisms case v40me most delayed the flow arrival in the emergent condition however in submerged vegetation cases the reflection seaward was comparatively reduced due to the reduction of seaward vegetation resistance therefore the delay effect was smaller than that in the emergent condition the delay effect by seaward vegetation is related to the reduction of incoming water volume by the combination of vegetation and embankment thus it becomes smaller with the condition of high tsunami where vegetation is submerged from this study for a countermeasure focusing only on the delay in tsunami arrival time utilizing limited land space the expansion of vegetation longitudinally case evs60 and vs80 was effective to delay the arrival of a large tsunami in which trees become submerged 4 2 implication on renewal of forest in hybrid structure as already explained considering the cases where part of the vegetation of the proposed hybrid type should be harvested or renewed the mixed vegetation cases of v20 and vs20 were conducted and the indices are listed in tables 1 and 3 table 3 does not show the optimal structure but visualizes the mitigation effect by changing vegetation resistance related to renewal e δq was reduced in vme cases because the reflection decreased due to the reduction of vegetation resistance and the overflow water volume increased related to this the delay effect became smaller and fluid force and moment by fluid force became higher and then e at e rfi and e rmi were reduced however case v20vs20me shows the closer mitigation effect in case v40me even when h 1 58 in this study case vs20v20me shows a higher mitigation effect than case vs40me in emv cases e δq showed values close to each other because overflow water volumes were almost the same in the landward vegetation cases the fluid force index and moment index were changed depending on the vegetation arrangement rashedunnabi et al 2019 showed the mitigation effect of the combination of an embankment with a landward horizontally double layer forest in the steady flow condition this study also used the horizontally double layer forest model such as vs40v40 in this study however submerged vegetation gives higher resistance than emergent vegetation because the density of submerged vegetation is larger than that of emergent vegetation which can apply to the actual case the study shows that the order of effectiveness that can reduce the energy behind their structures is case eftt case efst case efts and case en e embankment f forest vegetation subscripts s and t shows submerged and emergent condition and the order shows the structure from seaward the energy head in case efts became higher than in case efst because the water gradient through the vegetation in case efts was steeper flow velocity in upper zone of submerged vegetation was supposed to be higher and thus the resistance by submerged vegetation became relatively smaller in this study the water gradient through the vegetation in case emv20vs20 was steeper than that in case emvs20v20 shown in fig 10 and the fluid force index and moment index at g3 in case emv20vs20 were higher than those in case emvs20v20 in which the density of submerged vegetation was the same as that of emergent vegetation both studies showed similar structures concerned with tsunami mitigation effects that focused on the vegetation behind an embankment although the experimental conditions were largely different in their study and the results cannot be compared simply therefore the combination of vs20 and v20 behind an embankment was examined for not only the initial dense rashedunnabi et al 2019 but also long term vegetation conditions considering self thinning or thinning management igarashi et al 2019 this vegetation type grows naturally in the area where the sea wind is strong and it is easily included as a part of coastal defense system harada and kawata 2005 conducted a numerical simulation for elucidating the tsunami mitigation function of a coastal forest focusing on the tree height and tree density the study showed that the lower tree crown height reduced the run up height on a slope because the crown gives larger resistance to a tsunami than the tree trunk igarashi et al 2019 considered tree thinning by changing the tree density and tree standing structures tree trunk diameter tree height crown height and width etc by modelling the tree dahurian larch larix gmelinii breaking by the external force of a tsunami in the study the forest with high tree density and relatively smaller tree height reduced the fluid force index more behind the vegetation compared with the structure after thinning management further when the trees are young the trees are overturned tanaka et al 2013 2018 and can provide resistance even after the tree breaks when half the vegetation is renewed as in case v20vs20me it can mitigate the tsunami effectively in the seaward vegetation type because the water gradient through the seaward vegetation v20 is steep and the water level in the landward vegetation vs20 is low on the other hand in the landward type case emvs20v20 was effective although the renewal was modelled by changing tree height in this study the tree crown height and density not considered in the physical model were important parameters for tsunami mitigation by vegetation according to noarayanan et al 2012 the resistance can be changed by the vegetation parameters i e the length of the vegetation the ratio of the vegetation spacing and diameter of the vegetation sp d and the vegetation flow parameter vfp which includes the parameters of structural rigidity of vegetal stems green belt and flow parameters although these parameters were not changed systematically in this study however the optimal conditions of vegetation itself are needed to be discussed for further improving the mitigation effects by the vegetation therefore further experiments and numerical simulations are needed to generalize the mitigation effects of vegetation in hybrid structures in terms of vegetation maintenance with changing tree crown height vegetation density and vfp 5 summary and conclusions the differences between hybrid defenses utilizing vegetation were compared between submerged this study and emergent conditions zaha et al 2019 especially the differences of tsunami mitigation effects by seaward vegetation became smaller than those in any other type because reflected waves were weakened in relation to the reduction by vegetation resistance in the submerged condition the optimal structures are discussed utilizing four indices δq arrival time rfi and rmi in the submerged condition obtained from this experiment the optimal hybrid structure of δq arrival time and rfi and rmi for seaward center and landward vegetation types are case vs40me case evs60 and case emvs40 respectively for δq and rfi and rmi the optimal structure was the same with that in emergent condition zaha et al 2019 in case vs40me the flow was reflected by the seaward vegetation the incoming water volume to the moat was reduced and the landward slope of the moat and embankment further reflected the current and thus the reduction of overflowing water volume δq was the highest in case emvs40 collision at the moat dissipated more energy after overflowing the embankment after passing the moat the water level in front of the vegetation was increased and the flow velocity through the vegetation was reduced by the tree resistance then case emvs40 mostly reduced the fluid force index and moment index of the landward type the expansion of vegetation longitudinally case evs60 was effective to delay the tsunami arrival against the large tsunami where trees become submerged the change in tsunami mitigation effects by the vegetation renewal was demonstrated in vme and emv which were optimal in this series of experiments the results of δq rfi and rmi show that the mitigation effects were in between emergent and submerged conditions however the numerical simulations including the resistance of the tree crown and tree breaking to the tsunami external force are needed to generalize the mitigation effect of hybrid system utilizing vegetation credit authorship contribution statement yuya kimiwada investigation writing original draft

optimization scantling optimization fpso turret area 1 introduction with the continuous development of computer technology the coupling of optimization and simulation has been receiving more and more attention for ship structural optimization problems the finite element analysis fea method is the dominant method for structural analysis and frequently used as the evaluation tool during the optimization li et al 2015 a critical step in structural optimization coupling with the fea method is to adapt the finite element fe model during each optimization iteration as the ship structure consists of complex curved surfaces and associated structural members such as platforms web frames and stiffeners etc it is time consuming to generate an analysis suitable fe model this becomes a major limitation to get the result of analysis effectively during the optimization process to solve the above problem many efforts have been made to develop automatic mesh generation methods for hull structure analysis jensen 1990 and yoon and kim 1997 developed the indirect quadrilateral mesh generation methods to build the shell element model by combining predefined triangle mesh on the curved surface of a ship s outer shell but these methods are only suitable for non constraint meshing which have some difficulties to make the model meeting with the structural constraints lee et al 2003 and su et al 2004 proposed the algorithm to generate quadrilateral mesh on complex areas with arbitrary 2d boundary and line constraints imposed by structural constraints however a lot of complex numerical computation is required which is not feasible for mesh generation during the optimization process kim 2006 developed a mesh generation method based on a flexible data structure to generate the fe model using initial design information hull form offset data and compartment data jang et al 2008 proposed a stiffener based mesh generation method by decomposing the surface into sub domains by the line constraints converted from the stiffeners the fe modeling follows the specific features of the hull strictly with high mesh quality yu et al 2009 presented a new method for ship fe modeling based on the 3d parametric technique wang et al 2015 proposed an automated mesh generation algorithm for curved surfaces of ship structure which succeeds to deal with the intersections between ship hull surfaces and its frames however those methods highly depend on a geometry model which must be prepared in terms of certain rules before the mesh generation lin et al 2011 designed an algorithm for automatic fe mesh generation on the transverse structure of hulls using little geometry information the method focused on achieving automatic mesh generation in the transverse structure which is not applicable for local modification of fe in optimization in our study we propose a local mesh reconstruction method for simultaneous layout and scantling optimization of complex ship structures the mesh are reconstructed automatically by the proposed method without depending on the geometry model which is suitable for the optimization process meanwhile the practical structural constraints which guarantee the conformity and continuity of the mesh are considered the basic concept is that the fe model information including the shape and topology of meshes are handled by the node based data structure the node based data structure is designed based on the prototype structure before the optimization which is easy to index and modify the information of elements 2 the local mesh reconstruction method 2 1 the node based data structure as we know a finite element itself is defined by both topology and property the topology of a finite element refers to the shape of it for example the elements used for a hull outer surface are generally composed of 2d quadrilaterals and triangles and the elements used for hull stiffeners are 1d lines the properties of a finite element vary according to the element type for ship structure fe linear analysis two types of elements namely 2d shell and 1d beam are mainly applied in msc patran for the 2d shell the properties may consist of material and thickness for the 1d beam the properties include material beam cross sectional dimensions the orientation of cross section in space offsets of the centroid of the cross section from the two nodes defining the beam element etc to reconstruct the fe model all the above basic information needs to be stored properly and can be handled with design optimization information simultaneously in our study the information of all elements are stored according to the element topology and type fig 1 shows the schematic of element information for 2d quadrilateral shell one quadrilateral element is represented as q m q i d n i n j n k n l q t h i c k n e s s where q i d is the id number of the quadrilateral element n i n j n k n l are four nodes that build up the element which are represented by n i j k l n i d i j k l x i j k l y i j k l z i j k l where n i d i j k l is the id number of the nodes x i j k l y i j k l z i j k l are the coordinates q t h i c k n e s s is the plate thickness of the quadrilateral element similarly for 2d triangle shell one triangle element is represented as t m t i d n i n j n k t t h i c k n e s s where t i d is the id number of the triangle element n i n j n k are three nodes that build up the element t t h i c k n e s s is the plate thickness of the triangle element for 1d beam a 1d element is represented as b m b i d n i n j s n a m e v o r i e n t i o n v o f f s e t s where b i d is the id number of the beam element n i n j are two nodes that build up the element a local coordinate system o cg xy is built at the centroid of section as shown in fig 1 c s n a m e is the section name of beam element which contains information of beam cross sectional dimensions pre defined in beam library of patran system v o r i e n t i o n is a vector which represents orientation of cross section in global coordinate system oxyz i e the direction of axis y in o cg xy v o f f s e t s contains two vectors which define offsets of centroid of cross section from nodes ni and nj table 1 lists the basic representation of fe components in the node based data structure it has to be mentioned that some properties such as materials are not defined as these properties are not the focus and set as constants 2 2 the mesh reconstruction process this section describes the mesh reconstruction process proposed in this paper before reconstruction the initial mesh of sufficiently good quality is generated by properly splitting the geometry into quadrilateral elements or triangular elements this is the basic premise of the proposed method the detailed explanation of the reconstruction process is laid down stepwise as follows with an illustrating example of a typical bracket which is common in ship structure step 1 generation of the node based data structure according to the features of the ship structure the node data based structure of the initial model is built which represents the shape and topology information of all the elements of the initial model fig 2 shows the example of node based data structure for the typical bracket the node information shown in the top right corner of fig 2 includes the id numbers nid and positions of the nodes each node can be accessed through nid the element information shown in the left hand side of fig 2 includes the id number qid tid or bid the index list of the nodes and property the shape of each element can be handled through the index list of the nodes which make up the element through the data structure the shape and topology of the initial model are stored and inherited step2 creation of the modeling template for mesh reconstruction the modeling template contains all the information of reconstructed elements and can be run directly in the msc patran system msc software corporation 2012 the information of a reconstructed element includes the element id the ids and locations of the nodes that compose the element and the property of an element to inherit the shape and topology of the initial model all the information of the reconstructed elements are created by modifying the parameters of the data structure in step 1 in particular the numbering rules of node ids should be consistent with the original model the modeling template is written in patran command language pcl which is a programming language integrated into msc patran system msc software corporation 2012 to make the creation process automatic a converting code is developed by matlab to create the modeling template automatically step3 construction of the elements the modeling template is run in msc patran system to build the new elements fig 3 shows the example of mesh reconstruction of the bracket using the modeling template step4 check the resulting mesh as the reconstructed mesh inherit the shape of the initial structure the qualities of the reconstructed mesh themselves are guaranteed however as the layout of the structure is modified it is required to check conformity and continuity of the resulting mesh the nodes of resulting mesh at the common locations at the nodes of the adjacent structure are deleted as shown in the right hand side of fig 3 meanwhile the deleted nodes are replaced by the existing nodes of the adjacent structure it should be mentioned that a conforming mesh of the adjacent structure is required to make sure that nodes of new elements can be connected to nodes of the adjacent structure 3 the parametric fe model of the turret area 3 1 description of the prototype analysis model an internal turret area located at the bow of an fpso is taken as a typical example for the presented parametric fe modeling and optimization study the prototype is based on the original ship design which satisfy the requirements of relevant design rules and it is a typical type of turret structure which is mostly used in the current fpso internal turret mooring system as shown in fig 4 the turret area mainly consists of a mating cone platforms and web frames the structural materials of the turret area are higher tensile steels having properties given in table 2 the ah32 steel is used for web frames while the ah36 steel is used for mating cone and platforms an initial three dimensional fe model of the bow structure containing the turret area is set up in msc patran considering all main structural components see fig 5 a global rectangular coordinate system with the origin at the centerline ship baseline and aft bulkhead of bow structure o 1 xyz is built as reference coordinate system all major structural components such as shell plating transverse and longitudinal bulkheads decks web frames and so on are idealized by shell elements with in plane and bending stiffness deck beams longitudinals and stiffeners are represented by beam elements table 3 shows the total number of nodes and elements used in this model besides the boundary condition loading conditions full loaded and ballast condition mooring loads including 5 directions and other global and local loads are considered according to bv rules bureau veritas 2016a 2016b total of 10 load cases are set for yield analysis of the turret area the detailed descriptions of the calculation settings were stated in lin et al 2019 3 2 mesh reconstruction of the web frames each web frame is composed of plates and the stiffeners around the opening as the vertical web frames are arranged radially between the mating cone and the platforms creating a cylindrical coordinate system can make it easier to define the web frame position and the location of nodes on the web frames hence a local cylindrical coordinate system o 2 rtz shown as fig 6 is built with origin at center line ship base line and center of turret mating cone and the axes r t ϕ z are in the radial angular and height dimensions of the mating cone before the reconstruction the original web frame located at ϕ 0 is set as the initial web frame the topology information of elements of the initial web frame remains unchanged and is used to create the modeling template fig 7 shows the schematic diagram of relationship between a generated web frame and the initial web frame under the cylindrical coordinate system o 2 rtz once the angle ϕ of a new web frame is set the node coordinates of new web frame are determined by modifying ϕ with r 0 and z 0 fixed the elements of the new web frame including 2d plates and 1d stiffeners around openings are created with generated nodes by keeping the same topology as the initial web frame the process described in section 2 2 is repeated to create all the web frames 4 the application to layout and scantling optimization 4 1 framework of the optimization the mesh reconstruction process is implemented and integrated through the isight platform based on matlab code and msc patran nastran fig 8 shows the framework of the optimization the initial structural fe model has to be prepared before optimization the optimization program starts with initialization including setting the initial design parameter values and ranges constraint ranges objective function and basic parameters of the algorithm after the design parameters are determined the node based data structure of the initial model is built then the modeling template consisting of pcl commands for building the new elements of the structure are automatically generated by matlab code by executing the modeling template new elements are locally built based on the prepared fe model through patran then the analysis file is submitted to nastran and the analysis results are summarized and transmitted to the optimizer for further constraint judgment 4 2 initialization and settings for example as stated above a typical internal turret is taken as the example to demonstrate the proposed mesh reconstruction process for the layout and scantling optimization the detailed description of initialization and settings during the optimization are as follows 1 the initial model the initial structural fe model has to be prepared first shown in fig 9 as the web frames would be built during the optimization all the web frames are deleted in the initial fe model before the optimization process 2 design variables the design variables and their ranges are given in table 6 all plate thickness of turret area structure are set as the integer design variables with an increment of 1 mm the number of the web frames n w e b is set as 4 6 8 or 12 the first built web frame is defined as the start web frame considering the engineering practice the web frames are always distributed equally on the mating cone hence when n w e b is determined the location of all the web frames is expressed by the angle of start web frame under o 2 rtz ϕ s t a r t because the web frames are distributed along circumference ϕ s t a r t is limited between 0 and 360 n w e b to avoid duplicated bracket distribution as the mesh reconstruction is performed locally the increment of ϕ s t a r t is limited as 15 to assure the conformity and continuity of the resulting whole mesh fig 10 shows some examples of web frames with different n w e b and ϕ s t a r t 3 objective and constraints the structure model is optimized using yielding constraints according to criteria of allowable stresses in bv rules bureau veritas 2016a 2016b and the difference in the material property the allowable stress σ a is calculated as σ a 1 1 α σ y where α is the basic allowable stress factor which is decided by the load cases in our study α is set as 0 8 σ y is the yield stress of material two maximum stresses σ c o n e p l a t σ w e b f r a m e should not exceed the allowable stresses that is σ c o n e p l a t 312 4 m p σ w e b f r a m e 277 2 m p a the objective of the optimization is to minimize structural weight of the turret area f w 4 optimization algorithm in an earlier work lin et al 2019 the evol algorithm rechenberg 1973 schwefel 1977 proposed for scantling optimization of turret area has been presented and discussed and the algorithm is also properly adopted in this study 4 3 optimization results and discussion a total of 300 iterations are executed during the optimization the fe model containing reconstructed web frames is automatically generated for each iteration the lowest value of the objective function f w 126770 kg with 20 3 reduction table 7 is found in the 280th iteration table 8 lists the corresponding values of design parameters compared with those of the prototype fig 11 plots the fe model of optimal solution compared to that of the prototype especially the layout of web frames can be seen fig 12 shows the stress distributions of the turret area under the maximum stress condition after and before optimization the number of web frames n w e b reduces from 12 to 4 playing an important role in reducing the structural weight evolution of objective function f w values for feasible solutions throughout the optimization is shown in fig 13 the solid red line represents the improved solutions all variants above the improved solution line are feasible but the structural weight of these variants is greater than those situated on the line evolutions of n w e b and ϕ s t a r t for feasible solutions throughout the optimization are shown in fig 14 5 conclusion this paper explores a local mesh reconstruction approach to automatic supplying fe models for layout and scantling optimization of the fpso turret area the shape and topology information of the elements are handled by generating the node based data structure of the initial structure the modeling template is created to guarantee the quality of the reconstructed elements by integrating the mesh reconstruction process in the optimization through the isight platform based on matlab code and msc patran nastran the reconstruction of the elements is performed automatically for each optimization iteration a typical inner turret area of fpso is taken as an example the layout of the web frames and scantling of all plates are optimized to reduce the structural weight of the turret area the developed framework integrating the proposed reconstruction method and fe analysis proves that it is possible to simultaneously perform layout and scantling optimization based on the proposed mesh reconstruction method the analysis progress and optimization result show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method which are well suited for use in the actual optimization problem of turret area structure it has to be mentioned that the buckling strength criteria which is not considered in the example may have an impact on the finally designed structure the other criteria including buckling strength criteria will be taken as the constraints during the optimization in our further study to make the integrated framework more suitable for engineering practice credit authorship contribution statement qu yang investigation software data curation writing

new elements can be connected to nodes of the adjacent structure 3 the parametric fe model of the turret area 3 1 description of the prototype analysis model an internal turret area located at the bow of an fpso is taken as a typical example for the presented parametric fe modeling and optimization study the prototype is based on the original ship design which satisfy the requirements of relevant design rules and it is a typical type of turret structure which is mostly used in the current fpso internal turret mooring system as shown in fig 4 the turret area mainly consists of a mating cone platforms and web frames the structural materials of the turret area are higher tensile steels having properties given in table 2 the ah32 steel is used for web frames while the ah36 steel is used for mating cone and platforms an initial three dimensional fe model of the bow structure containing the turret area is set up in msc patran considering all main structural components see fig 5 a global rectangular coordinate system with the origin at the centerline ship baseline and aft bulkhead of bow structure o 1 xyz is built as reference coordinate system all major structural components such as shell plating transverse and longitudinal bulkheads decks web frames and so on are idealized by shell elements with in plane and bending stiffness deck beams longitudinals and stiffeners are represented by beam elements table 3 shows the total number of nodes and elements used in this model besides the boundary condition loading conditions full loaded and ballast condition mooring loads including 5 directions and other global and local loads are considered according to bv rules bureau veritas 2016a 2016b total of 10 load cases are set for yield analysis of the turret area the detailed descriptions of the calculation settings were stated in lin et al 2019 3 2 mesh reconstruction of the web frames each web frame is composed of plates and the stiffeners around the opening as the vertical web frames are arranged radially between the mating cone and the platforms creating a cylindrical coordinate system can make it easier to define the web frame position and the location of nodes on the web frames hence a local cylindrical coordinate system o 2 rtz shown as fig 6 is built with origin at center line ship base line and center of turret mating cone and the axes r t ϕ z are in the radial angular and height dimensions of the mating cone before the reconstruction the original web frame located at ϕ 0 is set as the initial web frame the topology information of elements of the initial web frame remains unchanged and is used to create the modeling template fig 7 shows the schematic diagram of relationship between a generated web frame and the initial web frame under the cylindrical coordinate system o 2 rtz once the angle ϕ of a new web frame is set the node coordinates of new web frame are determined by modifying ϕ with r 0 and z 0 fixed the elements of the new web frame including 2d plates and 1d stiffeners around openings are created with generated nodes by keeping the same topology as the initial web frame the process described in section 2 2 is repeated to create all the web frames 4 the application to layout and scantling optimization 4 1 framework of the optimization the mesh reconstruction process is implemented and integrated through the isight platform based on matlab code and msc patran nastran fig 8 shows the framework of the optimization the initial structural fe model has to be prepared before optimization the optimization program starts with initialization including setting the initial design parameter values and ranges constraint ranges objective function and basic parameters of the algorithm after the design parameters are determined the node based data structure of the initial model is built then the modeling template consisting of pcl commands for building the new elements of the structure are automatically generated by matlab code by executing the modeling template new elements are locally built based on the prepared fe model through patran then the analysis file is submitted to nastran and the analysis results are summarized and transmitted to the optimizer for further constraint judgment 4 2 initialization and settings for example as stated above a typical internal turret is taken as the example to demonstrate the proposed mesh reconstruction process for the layout and scantling optimization the detailed description of initialization and settings during the optimization are as follows 1 the initial model the initial structural fe model has to be prepared first shown in fig 9 as the web frames would be built during the optimization all the web frames are deleted in the initial fe model before the optimization process 2 design variables the design variables and their ranges are given in table 6 all plate thickness of turret area structure are set as the integer design variables with an increment of 1 mm the number of the web frames n w e b is set as 4 6 8 or 12 the first built web frame is defined as the start web frame considering the engineering practice the web frames are always distributed equally on the mating cone hence when n w e b is determined the location of all the web frames is expressed by the angle of start web frame under o 2 rtz ϕ s t a r t because the web frames are distributed along circumference ϕ s t a r t is limited between 0 and 360 n w e b to avoid duplicated bracket distribution as the mesh reconstruction is performed locally the increment of ϕ s t a r t is limited as 15 to assure the conformity and continuity of the resulting whole mesh fig 10 shows some examples of web frames with different n w e b and ϕ s t a r t 3 objective and constraints the structure model is optimized using yielding constraints according to criteria of allowable stresses in bv rules bureau veritas 2016a 2016b and the difference in the material property the allowable stress σ a is calculated as σ a 1 1 α σ y where α is the basic allowable stress factor which is decided by the load cases in our study α is set as 0 8 σ y is the yield stress of material two maximum stresses σ c o n e p l a t σ w e b f r a m e should not exceed the allowable stresses that is σ c o n e p l a t 312 4 m p σ w e b f r a m e 277 2 m p a the objective of the optimization is to minimize structural weight of the turret area f w 4 optimization algorithm in an earlier work lin et al 2019 the evol algorithm rechenberg 1973 schwefel 1977 proposed for scantling optimization of turret area has been presented and discussed and the algorithm is also properly adopted in this study 4 3 optimization results and discussion a total of 300 iterations are executed during the optimization the fe model containing reconstructed web frames is automatically generated for each iteration the lowest value of the objective function f w 126770 kg with 20 3 reduction table 7 is found in the 280th iteration table 8 lists the corresponding values of design parameters compared with those of the prototype fig 11 plots the fe model of optimal solution compared to that of the prototype especially the layout of web frames can be seen fig 12 shows the stress distributions of the turret area under the maximum stress condition after and before optimization the number of web frames n w e b reduces from 12 to 4 playing an important role in reducing the structural weight evolution of objective function f w values for feasible solutions throughout the optimization is shown in fig 13 the solid red line represents the improved solutions all variants above the improved solution line are feasible but the structural weight of these variants is greater than those situated on the line evolutions of n w e b and ϕ s t a r t for feasible solutions throughout the optimization are shown in fig 14 5 conclusion this paper explores a local mesh reconstruction approach to automatic supplying fe models for layout and scantling optimization of the fpso turret area the shape and topology information of the elements are handled by generating the node based data structure of the initial structure the modeling template is created to guarantee the quality of the reconstructed elements by integrating the mesh reconstruction process in the optimization through the isight platform based on matlab code and msc patran nastran the reconstruction of the elements is performed automatically for each optimization iteration a typical inner turret area of fpso is taken as an example the layout of the web frames and scantling of all plates are optimized to reduce the structural weight of the turret area the developed framework integrating the proposed reconstruction method and fe analysis proves that it is possible to simultaneously perform layout and scantling optimization based on the proposed mesh reconstruction method the analysis progress and optimization result show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method which are well suited for use in the actual optimization problem of turret area structure it has to be mentioned that the buckling strength criteria which is not considered in the example may have an impact on the finally designed structure the other criteria including buckling strength criteria will be taken as the constraints during the optimization in our further study to make the integrated framework more suitable for engineering practice credit authorship contribution statement qu yang investigation software data curation writing

21818,as a deep water foundation composite caisson pile foundation ccpf is usually subjected to horizontal dynamic loads and moments due to the complicated marine environment in this study model tests were performed on three different types of deep water foundation including caisson caisson with four piles and eight piles to investigate their lateral nonlinear dynamic characteristics under various excitation forces meanwhile the effect of scour depth on the dynamic response of the foundations were also studies the test results indicate that the excitation force and scour depth significantly affect the vibration amplitude and resonant frequency of the foundations with an obvious nonlinear behavior compared with the caisson adding piles beneath the caisson results in a decrease of the vibration amplitude and an increase of resonant frequency and the configuration of the pile also has an influence the experimental results are compared with the results obtained by a simplified dynamic winkler analysis model proposed here despite its simplicity a reasonable agreement between the experimental and the calculated responses was observed moreover scaling laws have been applied in the ccpf model to discuss the dynamic behavior of the prototype foundation keywords caisson pile foundation horizontal excitation model test scour nonlinear analysis 1 introduction generally there are two typical deep water foundations used in a cross sea bridge pile groups and caisson foundation in fact extensive researches have been done on the caisson and pile groups which have formed a relatively complete system both in theory and engineering practice gerolymos and gazetas 2006c wang et al 2017 boominathan and ayothiraman 2007a dobry and gazetas 1988 el naggar and novak 1996 manna and baidya 2012 however with the development of large scale exploitation of marine resource the construction of cross sea bridge gradually extends towards to ultra deep water area for example the composite caisson pile foundation ccpf was proposed in the pre construction investigation report of qiongzhou strait bridge in the south china sea zhong and huang 2013 2014a the ccpf is composed of a caisson and a group of piles connected to the caisson base as a deep water foundation it is clear that the foundation will be subjected to many lateral dynamic loads due to the wind water flows water waves and potential boat crashing or vehicle braking therefore a reasonable analysis method is needed to obtain the lateral dynamic response for this new foundation which can provide a theoretical basis for the popularization and application of the foundation at present few academic investigations on the ccpf were made especially for the dynamic response fortunately relevant research results about the caisson and pile group can be used as a reference to study the dynamic characteristics of ccpf however it should be noted that the results cannot be directly applied to the ccpf since there is a dynamic interaction between the pile group and the caisson part dynamic centrifuge tests were carried out to study the seismic response of ccpf zhong and huang 2014b but the bridge foundation in a relatively complex deep water environment is very common to be exposed to waves and strong winds rather than earthquakes therefore it is necessary to pay more attention to its performance under horizontal dynamic loads such as waves and typhoons zhong and huang 2013 developed a dynamic winkler soil model in the frequency domain for the lateral response of ccpf but it was restricted to elastic analyses considering the nonlinear behavior of soil it is indeed necessary to extend the analysis from linear elastic to nonlinear behavior experiments also should be performed to better understand the dynamic response of ccpf subjected to horizontal excitations and to validate the extended nonlinear dynamic winkler model meanwhile as a deep water foundation it is inevitable to suffer the scour effect the soil loss caused by the scour effect will further result in a change of deformation and bearing characteristics of the foundation over the past 30 years it is reported that more than 1000 bridges have collapsed in the united states and about 60 of the collapses were caused by the scour effect lagasse and richardson 2001 lin et al 2010 and liang et al 2017 concluded that scouring results in a decrease of pile lateral and vertical bearing capacity chang et al 2014 investigated the performance of scoured caisson foundation under earthquake loads and drew a conclusion that the scouring will lead to an increase of the displacement of the foundation tu et al 2016 discussed the influence of scouring on the dynamic impedance of ccpf using theoretical analysis but the soil was assumed to be linear elastic in the analyses nevertheless it is well recognized that the soil is nonlinear and plastic in general therefore it is necessary to investigate the nonlinear dynamic properties of ccpf and the effect of scouring considering the aforementioned limitations the objective of this paper is to investigate the nonlinear dynamic response of the ccpf under horizontal excitations and the scour effect on the lateral dynamic response of the ccpf a comprehensive study on ccpfs involving both laboratory model tests and theoretical analyses are described to account for the effect of pile group configuration beneath the caisson caisson with four piles and caisson with eight piles are used in model tests dynamic properties of the soil used in the model tests were determined by resonant column tests rct and torsional shear tests tst the dynamic amplitude of foundation under different excitation forces and frequencies were obtained meanwhile the effect of different scour depths on the lateral dynamic response was also studied in the model tests the scour depth around the foundation is simply simulated by reducing the embedded depth of foundation the dynamic response of the foundations in the model were also analyzed by a simplified dynamic winkler model proposed in this study in which a modified stress strain relationship is used to account for the cyclic nonlinear characteristics of sand the experimental results and calculated results are compared and discussed finally to provide a reference for engineering application the mechanical relationships between the prototype and the model foundation are established by a scaling law for 1 g model test 2 horizontal excitation test the ccpf designed in the pre construction investigation report of qiongzhou strait bridge in the south china sea is used as the prototype for the model test the schematic diagram of the ccpf is shown in fig 1 as seen in fig 1 caisson with four piles and caisson with eight piles are used to simulate the effect of the configuration of the pile the geometrical scaling factor λ n was determined as 400 for the ccpf model and the dimensions of the model foundation are listed in table 1 for comparison tests were also performed on a single caisson foundation which was the caisson part of a ccpf the used caisson and caisson pile foundations are both made of aluminum scaling laws are the main factors in a small scale model test according to iai et al 2005 besides the geometrical scaling factor λ n the density scaling factor λ ρ and the strain scaling factor λ ε are also the basic factors for 1 g model test all the other scaling factors such as frequency time and stiffness can be determined based on λ n λ ρ and λ ε here the density scaling factor λ ρ was determined as 1 0 the strain scaling factor λ ε was determined as λ n vs m vs p 2 where vs m and vs p are the shear velocities of soil deposits in the model container and the prototype respectively iai and sugano 1999 considering the low frequency of natural vibration loads such as wind and water waves excess pore water will not be generated in the sand although the foundation in reality is under water hence a dry clean sand was used in the model test the mean particle size d 50 of sand is 0 15 mm and the soil density is 1480 kg m3 corresponding to a void ratio of 0 77 2 1 experimental setup the apparatus for the horizontal excitation test is schematically shown in fig 2 it mainly consists of two parts vibration system electrodynamic exciter power amplifier and loading frame and data acquisition and analysis system das charge amplifier data acquisition and analyzer daa acceleration sensor and force transducer the model test was carried out in a rectangular container with a rigid boundary wall dynamic tests directly conducted in this container may result in differences between the measured and the expected data due to severe wave reflection from the rigid boundary to minimize the wave reflection from the rigid boundary sponge was attached to the internal side of the container li et al 2006 during the vibration test the caisson or ccpf are excited by the electrodynamic exciter with a precision of 0 1 n which is attached to the top of the caisson part an acceleration sensor on the top center of the caisson is used to record the dynamic response of the foundation therefore the dynamic displacement amplitude of the foundation is derived from double integration of the acceleration signals a force transducer is placed between the exciter and foundation to record the time history of the excitation force the principal diagram of the excitation test is shown in fig 3 first a sinusoidal harmonic vibration signal is output from the computer then transformed by the das and finally applied to the foundation by the electrodynamic exciter the force transducer f1 monitors whether the excitation force is consistent with the dynamic signal output from the computer the acceleration sensor a1 at the top center of caisson collects the dynamic response of the foundation the acceleration sensor a2 attached to the rigid boundary was used to monitor the acceleration response of the model container 2 2 test procedure the model tests were carried out on three different types of foundations listed in table 2 the initial embedded depth of the caisson foundation and ccpf are 115 mm and 85 mm respectively the scour depth is simply simulated by removing the soil layer by layer in order to make a comparative study about the caisson foundation and the ccpf different scour depths have been determined the horizontal ultimate bearing capacity of the foundation can be obtained from static tests which is used to estimate the amplitude of dynamic load during the tests the sand bed was prepared layer by layer and the thickness of each layer is 10 cm the sand was placed and hand packed in the container and the model foundation was installed in the center of the ground during sand filling the force displacement curves of foundations in the static horizontal loading tests are shown in fig 4 it can be observed the initial ultimate bearing capacity p u of caisson caisson with four piles and caisson with eight piles are 49 5 n 101 5 n and 109 7 n respectively these values change to 13 2 n 67 4 n and 70 5 n with a scour whose depths are listed in table 2 the experimental conditions for caisson with four piles and caisson with eight piles are the same the difference between the bearing capacities mainly results from the pile configuration beneath the caisson base but this difference is relatively small the static performance of ccpf is greater than that of the caisson since the pile group makes full use of the properties of the deep soil layer even though the embedded depth of the caisson is larger than that of the ccpf before scouring for harmonic excitation tests the dynamic load acted on the foundation is a key parameter since the time history response of acceleration will continuously change with the increase of load cycle if a larger dynamic load is selected a smaller value is better for smooth acceleration signal output meanwhile considering the comparability between the ccpf and caisson under the same test conditions the horizontal ultimate bearing capacity of the caisson is used as the reference to select the load amplitude of the dynamic test the sinusoidal lateral harmonic loads applied at the top center of foundation were chosen to be 2 3 and 4 n which are about 0 15 0 3p u where the p u is the ultimate lateral capacity of caisson foundation after scouring since the resonant frequency of the foundation cannot be known in advance the excitation frequency starts from 2 hz until the peak displacement of the foundation occurs 2 3 test results fig 5 compares the output excitation force signal measured by the force transducer f1 at a frequency of 13 hz with the input excitation force signal in the computer it can be seen that the output force signal is almost the same as the input force signal which shows the stability of the excitation load during the test typical time histories of the force and acceleration at the top of ccpf obtained from the force transducer and acceleration sensor are shown in fig 6 here the ccpf was subjected to a sinusoidal harmonic excitation with a frequency f 13 hz it can be seen that the dynamic force and acceleration of ccpf are sinusoidal and the acceleration lags behind the dynamic force damping effect may be the main factor causing the phase difference between the force and acceleration the acceleration recorded by the sensor a2 is quite small when comparing with the value recorded by sensor a1 it indicates that the dynamic response of cppf induced by the environmental vibration and wave reflection is small and the response of ccpf is less interfered by the reflected waves for other cases the time history curves of force and acceleration are quite similar to those in fig 6 and these curves are not listed here for simplicity figs 7 9 plot the horizontal dynamic displacements of the caisson and ccpf under different excitation forces and scour depths against the load frequency the resonant frequency and peak displacement of foundation in different cases are summarized in tables 3 4 the displacement of foundation is derived from the double integration of acceleration signal it can be found that the displacement amplitude of the caisson and ccpf show nonlinear increase trend with the increase of excitation force these imply that the model tests are accompanied by soil nonlinear effect such as the stiffness degradation or an increase of soil damping according to the displacement of the foundation the nonlinearity degree of caisson is greater than that of ccpfs which shows an improvement in lateral dynamic response after adding piles beneath the caisson considering the scour effect the maximum increase of peak displacement amplitude of the ccpf with four piles is about 127 when the excitation force is 2 n while the maximum increase of peak displacement amplitude of ccpf with eight piles is about 113 the results show that scouring result in an obvious decrease in the lateral dynamic impedance of the foundation and it also reflects that the configuration of the pile has a certain effect on the lateral dynamic response of ccpf figs 7 9 also show that the increase of the displacement amplitude of the caisson foundation is about 257 after scouring while it is about 110 for ccpf it reflects the positive effect of adding pile beneath the caisson base there is also a considerable shift in the resonant frequency with increasing excitation force as the load increases the soil will show nonlinear characteristics which will cause the soil shear modulus to decrease then the dynamic stiffness of the foundation will decrease which can be proved from eq a 5 and a 8 in the appendix it also can be found that the caisson has the largest reduction in resonant frequency after scouring when the excitation force equals 4 n while the decrease rate of resonant frequency for ccpf is slower than that of the caisson these mainly depend on the soil disturbance caused by the vibration and the nonlinear degree of soil around the foundation when the foundation is subjected to excitation loads although the excitation force is relatively small for the caisson and ccpf used in this study and the static displacement is almost the same according to fig 4 the soil foundation interaction involves obvious material and geometric nonlinearities the dynamic responses among these three types of foundations show relatively large differences 3 resonant column and torsional shear tests resonant column test rct and torsional shear test tst are carried out to obtain the soil properties at small strain range a resonant column device made by global digital system gds is used in this study as shown in fig 10 it is of a stokoe type with bottom fixed and top free configuration air dry specimens of the same sand as in the model test was tested the effective confining pressure was isotropically consolidated stage by stage from 15 to 40 kpa as determined by the soil effective stress around the foundation in the model test at each stage the dynamic properties of soil are measured using rct and tst table 5 lists the results of rct and tst while fig 11 shows the normalized shear modulus of specimen from rct and tst to eliminate the effect of void ratio change the initial small strain shear modulus g 0 was fitted by an empirical equation hardin and richart 1963 yang and gu 2013 gu et al 2015 as 1 g 0 85 5 f e σ m p a 0 5 f e 2 17 e 2 1 e where f e is the function of void ratio e σ m is the effective mean confining stress of soil and p a is a reference stress which is 98 kpa here during the tst the shear stress strain curves of the soil under different effective confining pressure cp and cyclic shear stresses are obtained figs 12 14 show the hysteresis loops at three different strain amplitudes when the effective confining pressure equals 20 kpa 30 kpa and 40 kpa respectively it can be seen that the soil shows nonlinear characteristics the shape of the hysteresis loop continually changes with the number of cycles and the nonlinear characteristics is more obvious at larger strain amplitudes these results convincingly show that it is necessary to consider the soil nonlinear characteristic during the theoretical analysis and engineering practice 4 analytical investigation 4 1 analytical model the analytical model summarized herein was proposed by huang et al 2018 for the analysis of lateral dynamic response of ccpf in layered cohesive soils for a ccpf subjected to both horizontal force q 0 and moment m 0 the dynamic response with respect to the center of the caisson base can be expressed as follows 2 a u c u p f c h m f p h m v p b p c p p o o o 3 a a 11 a 12 a 13 a 14 a 15 a 21 a 22 a 23 a 24 a 25 a 31 a 32 a 33 a 34 a 35 a 41 a 42 a 43 a 44 a 45 a 51 a 52 a 53 a 54 a 55 a 61 o o o a 65 where a is an unsymmetrical matrix all the sub matrices a ij of a and other elements in eq 3 can be found in appendix a the analytical model mentioned above cannot be directly applied in this model test since the nonlinear analysis procedure is only suitable for cohesive soils therefore it should be modified for sand first the hardin drnevich model hardin and drnevich 1972 is selected for the backbone curve as 4 τ γ 1 g 0 γ τ f where γ is shear strain of soil τ f is the shear stress at failure g 0 is the initial small stain shear modulus then the hysteretic curve of shear stress and strain can be expressed as 5 τ τ u r γ γ u r 1 g 0 γ γ u r κ 0 τ f where γ ur γ u r and τ ur are the current soil reaction at the onset of unloading or reloading as shown in fig 15 κ 0 is the pyke s scaling parameter pyke 1979 and the plus and minus signs denote unloading and reloading respectively for sand there was no apparent gapping between the soil and foundation when the foundation was subjected to lateral load which is different from the cohesive soil described in huang et al 2018 generally sand shows a cyclic hardening behavior under a long term cyclic load and the degradation will take place in saturated sand under undrained conditions due to the generation of excessive pore water pressure matasović and vucetic 1993 achmus et al 2009 the cyclic hardening or degradation characteristics are usually characterized by the number of load cycles or accumulated plastic shear strain vucetic 1994 lee et al 2009 in this study to demonstrate the cyclic characteristics of sand the accumulated plastic shear strain γ p and a cyclic hardening or degradation model was introduced into the hysteresis loops and the total γ p for m cycles can be calculated by a summation of the irrecoverable shear strain generated in each cycle huang and liu 2015 6 δ e δ e h 1 δ e h e b γ p 7 γ p γ p i i 1 2 3 2 m 1 2 m where b is a material parameter reflecting the rate of cyclic hardening or degradation with the accumulated shear strain δ e e s 1 e s 0 stands for the stiffness hardening or degradation factor and δ e h e s h e s 0 is defined as the residual stiffness ratio where e s 0 e s 1 and e s h are the initial elastic modulus before cyclic loading the current elastic modulus after cyclic loading and the final residual elastic modulus after cyclic loading respectively γ p i is the accumulated plastic shear strain at the ith cycle and the γ p 1 and γ p 2 are shown in fig 15 4 2 comparison between experimental and analytical results the dynamic responses of the foundation under various excitation loads and different scour depths are obtained by the simplified method mentioned above as shown in figs 7 9 here the soil parameters are determined by the rct and tst to avoid errors caused by the improper selection of soil parameters the initial small strain shear modulus of sand is calculated by eq 1 and the fitted hysteresis loops of stress strain are shown in fig 15 in which δ e h b and κ 0 are assumed to be 1 5 3 0 and 2 0 respectively similarly the peak displacement amplitude and resonant frequency calculated by the simplified method are also summarized in tables 3 4 it can be seen that the trend of the theoretical results is close to that of the experimental results the dynamic response of foundation increases with the increase of excitation force under scouring conditions adding piles beneath the caisson obviously improves the dynamic characteristics of the caisson the peak displacement and resonant frequency in numerical analyses are slightly larger than those in experiments this may be due to the assumptions that the caisson foundation is completely rigid in the simplified model and the connection between the caisson and pile group is fully fixed which are inconsistent with the model test despite the simplicity of the analysis model a reasonable match between the experimental results and theoretical results can be observed by using the soil parameters measured by rct and tst which ensures the reliability of the simplified method for better illustration the time history of displacements at the top center of caisson when the excitation force is 4 n at a resonant frequency are plotted in figs 16 18 it is clear that the curves have slightly asymmetry at the first several cycles but towards to uniform at subsequent loading cycles especially for scouring cases the main reason of this phenomenon is the soil nonlinearity developed with increasing number of load cycles the dynamic responses of foundations after scouring also indicate that piles can effectively improve the lateral dynamic performance in addition the bending stiffness of pile groups beneath the caisson in the ccpf with 4 piles is higher than that of the ccpf with 8 piles however the dynamic displacement response of the caisson with 8 piles is slightly lower than that of the with 4 piles it indicates that the design or layout of pile groups beneath the caisson may have a significant effect on the dynamic response of the composite foundation the soil stress strain hysteresis curves at different depths along the caisson shaft when the excitation force is 4 n at resonant frequency also have been obtained in figs 19 and 20 as seen in figs 19 20 the first cycle of curves has an offset compared with the loops during subsequent cycles due to the soil nonlinearity the results also show that the dynamic response of the horizontal spring becomes stiffer with the increase of depth this stems from the fact that the lateral displacements at larger depth are relatively small with respect to the ground surface in addition it is found that the stress strain hysteresis loops of caisson foundation after scouring show an obvious nonlinear characteristic due to the weakening of soil lateral restraint but the patterns of the stress strain curves of the ccpf are almost not affected by the scouring this shows the positive effect of adding piles on the lateral dynamic response from the soil mechanics perspective for further illustration the soil stress strain hysteresis curves of the ccpf foundations at pile head when the excitation force is 4 n at resonant frequency are plotted in fig 21 as seen in fig 21 although the shear strain and shear stress are relatively low the hysteresis curves exhibit similar response as the soil around the caisson shaft in figs 19 and 20 the first loading cycle also has an offset compared with the loops during subsequent cycles however the main factor causing the offset may be different from the one mentioned in figs 19 and 20 for better understanding the time histories of soil stress and strain at the pile head after scouring are shown in figs 22 and 23 according to figs 22 and 23 the main factor is that the pile head first produces a displacement opposite to the direction of horizontal excitation force and then generates a displacement in the same direction as the horizontal excitation force this reverse phenomenon in the first cycle is mainly due to the relatively small pure lateral displacement at first and the rocking displacement results in a reverse movement at the base center of the caisson however such phenomenon will disappear as the pure lateral displacement increases all the dynamic excitation tests are conducted using staged procedure in which the excitation force increases stage by stage on the same model and sufficient time interval between two tests was assured for sand consolidation however two limitations need to be addressed firstly this dynamic test performed above is a small scale model test due to the contradiction between the model scale and material selection it is difficult to determine its relationships with the prototype foundation therefore the test results were used to determine the influence of various scour depths and excitation forces on the ccpf dynamic response which is similar to a study of boominathan and ayothiraman 2005 2007b secondly the rct and tst were both carried out at relatively low effective confining pressure and the dynamic experiment conducted on ccpf is also embedded in a low effective confining pressure it is inconsistent with the engineering practice and the relative density of sand bed can be easily disturbed by the vibration which may also be the reason for the difference between the experimental and analytical results therefore the results of the dynamic test may be verified further and modified based on the full scale experiments at high effective confining pressure 5 discussions the relationships between the model and prototype foundations are a common concern in fact there is no direct equivalent relationship between the model and the prototype however the relationship can be obtained based on some assumptions as mentioned above λ n and λ ρ in this study equal 400 and 1 0 respectively λ ε equals λ n vs m vs p 2 or λ n g 0 m g 0 p in which g 0 m and g 0 p are the initial shear modulus of soil in the model and the prototype the g 0 m used in the model test is obtained by rct and tst as shown in table 5 empirically it is assumed that g 0 m g 0 p approximately equals 1 400 namely λ ε equal to 1 then the other scaling factors in this model test such as the time and stiffness can be determined based on the scaling factors of length λ n density λ ρ and strain λ ε iai et al 2005 the scaling factors for 1 g model tests are listed in table 6 according to the scaling factors listed in table 6 the resonant frequency of the model is λ n 0 5 times the resonant frequency of a prototype with the experimental results and scaling laws the dynamic displacement and resonance characteristics of the laterally loaded foundation before and after scouring can be obtained the lateral displacement amplitude of the prototype foundation may be increased significantly and even doubled after scouring based on the data listed in table 3 the resonant frequencies of the prototype foundations are calculated and shown in table 7 the results show that the resonant frequencies of the caisson foundation and ccpfs are located in the range of 0 4hz 0 9 hz it is obvious that the decrease of the resonant frequency of foundation caused by the scouring is more pronounced than that caused by an increase in the external load it should be noted that the resonant frequency of prototype foundation is oriented toward qualitative analysis since the selection of the shear modulus of soil is based on the empirical value the shear modulus of soil is very important for the dynamic response in theoretical analysis and engineering practice therefore in suit test cyclic triaxial test or resonant column test on undisturbed samples should be carried out to determine the soil dynamic properties before engineering application 6 conclusions horizontal harmonic excitation model tests were performed to study the nonlinear dynamic lateral responses of foundation under various excitation forces and scour depths three different foundation types were tested including caisson caisson with four piles and caisson with eight piles meanwhile a simplified dynamic winkler model was proposed to analyze the dynamic lateral response of the model foundations in which the nonlinear behavior of the sand can be considered the experimental results and numerical analyses were compared the following main conclusions may be drawn 1 the horizontal dynamic amplitude of the caisson and ccpfs shows a obvious nonlinear behavior during the horizontal harmonic vibration tests especially when the excitation force is large and scouring exists compared with the caisson foundation adding piles beneath the caisson base will remarkably reduce the dynamic amplitude of foundation especially around the resonant frequency meanwhile the pile configuration also shows a certain influence on the dynamic characteristics of foundation 2 the resonant frequency of the foundation decreases gradually as the excitation force and the scour depth increase indicating a nonlinear interaction between soil foundation meanwhile the experimental results show that the resonant frequency of the caisson decreases faster than that of the ccpfs 3 the results obtained by the proposed simplified nonlinear dynamic winkler model are consistent with those in the model tests the nonlinear behavior of the tested sand was measured by resonant column tests and torsional shear tests and the soil parameters in the proposed model were determined it should be noted that the accuracy of the proposed nonlinear model significantly depends on the soil parameters 4 according to the scaling laws for 1 g model tests the relationships between the model and prototype foundation are closely related to the shear modulus of soil therefore resonant column tests dynamic triaxial tests on undisturbed samples or in suit tests are suggested to determine the model parameters in engineering practice credit authorship

21818,as a deep water foundation composite caisson pile foundation ccpf is usually subjected to horizontal dynamic loads and moments due to the complicated marine environment in this study model tests were performed on three different types of deep water foundation including caisson caisson with four piles and eight piles to investigate their lateral nonlinear dynamic characteristics under various excitation forces meanwhile the effect of scour depth on the dynamic response of the foundations were also studies the test results indicate that the excitation force and scour depth significantly affect the vibration amplitude and resonant frequency of the foundations with an obvious nonlinear behavior compared with the caisson adding piles beneath the caisson results in a decrease of the vibration amplitude and an increase of resonant frequency and the configuration of the pile also has an influence the experimental results are compared with the results obtained by a simplified dynamic winkler analysis model proposed here despite its simplicity a reasonable agreement between the experimental and the calculated responses was observed moreover scaling laws have been applied in the ccpf model to discuss the dynamic behavior of the prototype foundation keywords caisson pile foundation horizontal excitation model test scour nonlinear analysis 1 introduction generally there are two typical deep water foundations used in a cross sea bridge pile groups and caisson foundation in fact extensive researches have been done on the caisson and pile groups which have formed a relatively complete system both in theory and engineering practice gerolymos and gazetas 2006c wang et al 2017 boominathan and ayothiraman 2007a dobry and gazetas 1988 el naggar and novak 1996 manna and baidya 2012 however with the development of large scale exploitation of marine resource the construction of cross sea bridge gradually extends towards to ultra deep water area for example the composite caisson pile foundation ccpf was proposed in the pre construction investigation report of qiongzhou strait bridge in the south china sea zhong and huang 2013 2014a the ccpf is composed of a caisson and a group of piles connected to the caisson base as a deep water foundation it is clear that the foundation will be subjected to many lateral dynamic loads due to the wind water flows water waves and potential boat crashing or vehicle braking therefore a reasonable analysis method is needed to obtain the lateral dynamic response for this new foundation which can provide a theoretical basis for the popularization and application of the foundation at present few academic investigations on the ccpf were made especially for the dynamic response fortunately relevant research results about the caisson and pile group can be used as a reference to study the dynamic characteristics of ccpf however it should be noted that the results cannot be directly applied to the ccpf since there is a dynamic interaction between the pile group and the caisson part dynamic centrifuge tests were carried out to study the seismic response of ccpf zhong and huang 2014b but the bridge foundation in a relatively complex deep water environment is very common to be exposed to waves and strong winds rather than earthquakes therefore it is necessary to pay more attention to its performance under horizontal dynamic loads such as waves and typhoons zhong and huang 2013 developed a dynamic winkler soil model in the frequency domain for the lateral response of ccpf but it was restricted to elastic analyses considering the nonlinear behavior of soil it is indeed necessary to extend the analysis from linear elastic to nonlinear behavior experiments also should be performed to better understand the dynamic response of ccpf subjected to horizontal excitations and to validate the extended nonlinear dynamic winkler model meanwhile as a deep water foundation it is inevitable to suffer the scour effect the soil loss caused by the scour effect will further result in a change of deformation and bearing characteristics of the foundation over the past 30 years it is reported that more than 1000 bridges have collapsed in the united states and about 60 of the collapses were caused by the scour effect lagasse and richardson 2001 lin et al 2010 and liang et al 2017 concluded that scouring results in a decrease of pile lateral and vertical bearing capacity chang et al 2014 investigated the performance of scoured caisson foundation under earthquake loads and drew a conclusion that the scouring will lead to an increase of the displacement of the foundation tu et al 2016 discussed the influence of scouring on the dynamic impedance of ccpf using theoretical analysis but the soil was assumed to be linear elastic in the analyses nevertheless it is well recognized that the soil is nonlinear and plastic in general therefore it is necessary to investigate the nonlinear dynamic properties of ccpf and the effect of scouring considering the aforementioned limitations the objective of this paper is to investigate the nonlinear dynamic response of the ccpf under horizontal excitations and the scour effect on the lateral dynamic response of the ccpf a comprehensive study on ccpfs involving both laboratory model tests and theoretical analyses are described to account for the effect of pile group configuration beneath the caisson caisson with four piles and caisson with eight piles are used in model tests dynamic properties of the soil used in the model tests were determined by resonant column tests rct and torsional shear tests tst the dynamic amplitude of foundation under different excitation forces and frequencies were obtained meanwhile the effect of different scour depths on the lateral dynamic response was also studied in the model tests the scour depth around the foundation is simply simulated by reducing the embedded depth of foundation the dynamic response of the foundations in the model were also analyzed by a simplified dynamic winkler model proposed in this study in which a modified stress strain relationship is used to account for the cyclic nonlinear characteristics of sand the experimental results and calculated results are compared and discussed finally to provide a reference for engineering application the mechanical relationships between the prototype and the model foundation are established by a scaling law for 1 g model test 2 horizontal excitation test the ccpf designed in the pre construction investigation report of qiongzhou strait bridge in the south china sea is used as the prototype for the model test the schematic diagram of the ccpf is shown in fig 1 as seen in fig 1 caisson with four piles and caisson with eight piles are used to simulate the effect of the configuration of the pile the geometrical scaling factor λ n was determined as 400 for the ccpf model and the dimensions of the model foundation are listed in table 1 for comparison tests were also performed on a single caisson foundation which was the caisson part of a ccpf the used caisson and caisson pile foundations are both made of aluminum scaling laws are the main factors in a small scale model test according to iai et al 2005 besides the geometrical scaling factor λ n the density scaling factor λ ρ and the strain scaling factor λ ε are also the basic factors for 1 g model test all the other scaling factors such as frequency time and stiffness can be determined based on λ n λ ρ and λ ε here the density scaling factor λ ρ was determined as 1 0 the strain scaling factor λ ε was determined as λ n vs m vs p 2 where vs m and vs p are the shear velocities of soil deposits in the model container and the prototype respectively iai and sugano 1999 considering the low frequency of natural vibration loads such as wind and water waves excess pore water will not be generated in the sand although the foundation in reality is under water hence a dry clean sand was used in the model test the mean particle size d 50 of sand is 0 15 mm and the soil density is 1480 kg m3 corresponding to a void ratio of 0 77 2 1 experimental setup the apparatus for the horizontal excitation test is schematically shown in fig 2 it mainly consists of two parts vibration system electrodynamic exciter power amplifier and loading frame and data acquisition and analysis system das charge amplifier data acquisition and analyzer daa acceleration sensor and force transducer the model test was carried out in a rectangular container with a rigid boundary wall dynamic tests directly conducted in this container may result in differences between the measured and the expected data due to severe wave reflection from the rigid boundary to minimize the wave reflection from the rigid boundary sponge was attached to the internal side of the container li et al 2006 during the vibration test the caisson or ccpf are excited by the electrodynamic exciter with a precision of 0 1 n which is attached to the top of the caisson part an acceleration sensor on the top center of the caisson is used to record the dynamic response of the foundation therefore the dynamic displacement amplitude of the foundation is derived from double integration of the acceleration signals a force transducer is placed between the exciter and foundation to record the time history of the excitation force the principal diagram of the excitation test is shown in fig 3 first a sinusoidal harmonic vibration signal is output from the computer then transformed by the das and finally applied to the foundation by the electrodynamic exciter the force transducer f1 monitors whether the excitation force is consistent with the dynamic signal output from the computer the acceleration sensor a1 at the top center of caisson collects the dynamic response of the foundation the acceleration sensor a2 attached to the rigid boundary was used to monitor the acceleration response of the model container 2 2 test procedure the model tests were carried out on three different types of foundations listed in table 2 the initial embedded depth of the caisson foundation and ccpf are 115 mm and 85 mm respectively the scour depth is simply simulated by removing the soil layer by layer in order to make a comparative study about the caisson foundation and the ccpf different scour depths have been determined the horizontal ultimate bearing capacity of the foundation can be obtained from static tests which is used to estimate the amplitude of dynamic load during the tests the sand bed was prepared layer by layer and the thickness of each layer is 10 cm the sand was placed and hand packed in the container and the model foundation was installed in the center of the ground during sand filling the force displacement curves of foundations in the static horizontal loading tests are shown in fig 4 it can be observed the initial ultimate bearing capacity p u of caisson caisson with four piles and caisson with eight piles are 49 5 n 101 5 n and 109 7 n respectively these values change to 13 2 n 67 4 n and 70 5 n with a scour whose depths are listed in table 2 the experimental conditions for caisson with four piles and caisson with eight piles are the same the difference between the bearing capacities mainly results from the pile configuration beneath the caisson base but this difference is relatively small the static performance of ccpf is greater than that of the caisson since the pile group makes full use of the properties of the deep soil layer even though the embedded depth of the caisson is larger than that of the ccpf before scouring for harmonic excitation tests the dynamic load acted on the foundation is a key parameter since the time history response of acceleration will continuously change with the increase of load cycle if a larger dynamic load is selected a smaller value is better for smooth acceleration signal output meanwhile considering the comparability between the ccpf and caisson under the same test conditions the horizontal ultimate bearing capacity of the caisson is used as the reference to select the load amplitude of the dynamic test the sinusoidal lateral harmonic loads applied at the top center of foundation were chosen to be 2 3 and 4 n which are about 0 15 0 3p u where the p u is the ultimate lateral capacity of caisson foundation after scouring since the resonant frequency of the foundation cannot be known in advance the excitation frequency starts from 2 hz until the peak displacement of the foundation occurs 2 3 test results fig 5 compares the output excitation force signal measured by the force transducer f1 at a frequency of 13 hz with the input excitation force signal in the computer it can be seen that the output force signal is almost the same as the input force signal which shows the stability of the excitation load during the test typical time histories of the force and acceleration at the top of ccpf obtained from the force transducer and acceleration sensor are shown in fig 6 here the ccpf was subjected to a sinusoidal harmonic excitation with a frequency f 13 hz it can be seen that the dynamic force and acceleration of ccpf are sinusoidal and the acceleration lags behind the dynamic force damping effect may be the main factor causing the phase difference between the force and acceleration the acceleration recorded by the sensor a2 is quite small when comparing with the value recorded by sensor a1 it indicates that the dynamic response of cppf induced by the environmental vibration and wave reflection is small and the response of ccpf is less interfered by the reflected waves for other cases the time history curves of force and acceleration are quite similar to those in fig 6 and these curves are not listed here for simplicity figs 7 9 plot the horizontal dynamic displacements of the caisson and ccpf under different excitation forces and scour depths against the load frequency the resonant frequency and peak displacement of foundation in different cases are summarized in tables 3 4 the displacement of foundation is derived from the double integration of acceleration signal it can be found that the displacement amplitude of the caisson and ccpf show nonlinear increase trend with the increase of excitation force these imply that the model tests are accompanied by soil nonlinear effect such as the stiffness degradation or an increase of soil damping according to the displacement of the foundation the nonlinearity degree of caisson is greater than that of ccpfs which shows an improvement in lateral dynamic response after adding piles beneath the caisson considering the scour effect the maximum increase of peak displacement amplitude of the ccpf with four piles is about 127 when the excitation force is 2 n while the maximum increase of peak displacement amplitude of ccpf with eight piles is about 113 the results show that scouring result in an obvious decrease in the lateral dynamic impedance of the foundation and it also reflects that the configuration of the pile has a certain effect on the lateral dynamic response of ccpf figs 7 9 also show that the increase of the displacement amplitude of the caisson foundation is about 257 after scouring while it is about 110 for ccpf it reflects the positive effect of adding pile beneath the caisson base there is also a considerable shift in the resonant frequency with increasing excitation force as the load increases the soil will show nonlinear characteristics which will cause the soil shear modulus to decrease then the dynamic stiffness of the foundation will decrease which can be proved from eq a 5 and a 8 in the appendix it also can be found that the caisson has the largest reduction in resonant frequency after scouring when the excitation force equals 4 n while the decrease rate of resonant frequency for ccpf is slower than that of the caisson these mainly depend on the soil disturbance caused by the vibration and the nonlinear degree of soil around the foundation when the foundation is subjected to excitation loads although the excitation force is relatively small for the caisson and ccpf used in this study and the static displacement is almost the same according to fig 4 the soil foundation interaction involves obvious material and geometric nonlinearities the dynamic responses among these three types of foundations show relatively large differences 3 resonant column and torsional shear tests resonant column test rct and torsional shear test tst are carried out to obtain the soil properties at small strain range a resonant column device made by global digital system gds is used in this study as shown in fig 10 it is of a stokoe type with bottom fixed and top free configuration air dry specimens of the same sand as in the model test was tested the effective confining pressure was isotropically consolidated stage by stage from 15 to 40 kpa as determined by the soil effective stress around the foundation in the model test at each stage the dynamic properties of soil are measured using rct and tst table 5 lists the results of rct and tst while fig 11 shows the normalized shear modulus of specimen from rct and tst to eliminate the effect of void ratio change the initial small strain shear modulus g 0 was fitted by an empirical equation hardin and richart 1963 yang and gu 2013 gu et al 2015 as 1 g 0 85 5 f e σ m p a 0 5 f e 2 17 e 2 1 e where f e is the function of void ratio e σ m is the effective mean confining stress of soil and p a is a reference stress which is 98 kpa here during the tst the shear stress strain curves of the soil under different effective confining pressure cp and cyclic shear stresses are obtained figs 12 14 show the hysteresis loops at three different strain amplitudes when the effective confining pressure equals 20 kpa 30 kpa and 40 kpa respectively it can be seen that the soil shows nonlinear characteristics the shape of the hysteresis loop continually changes with the number of cycles and the nonlinear characteristics is more obvious at larger strain amplitudes these results convincingly show that it is necessary to consider the soil nonlinear characteristic during the theoretical analysis and engineering practice 4 analytical investigation 4 1 analytical model the analytical model summarized herein was proposed by huang et al 2018 for the analysis of lateral dynamic response of ccpf in layered cohesive soils for a ccpf subjected to both horizontal force q 0 and moment m 0 the dynamic response with respect to the center of the caisson base can be expressed as follows 2 a u c u p f c h m f p h m v p b p c p p o o o 3 a a 11 a 12 a 13 a 14 a 15 a 21 a 22 a 23 a 24 a 25 a 31 a 32 a 33 a 34 a 35 a 41 a 42 a 43 a 44 a 45 a 51 a 52 a 53 a 54 a 55 a 61 o o o a 65 where a is an unsymmetrical matrix all the sub matrices a ij of a and other elements in eq 3 can be found in appendix a the analytical model mentioned above cannot be directly applied in this model test since the nonlinear analysis procedure is only suitable for cohesive soils therefore it should be modified for sand first the hardin drnevich model hardin and drnevich 1972 is selected for the backbone curve as 4 τ γ 1 g 0 γ τ f where γ is shear strain of soil τ f is the shear stress at failure g 0 is the initial small stain shear modulus then the hysteretic curve of shear stress and strain can be expressed as 5 τ τ u r γ γ u r 1 g 0 γ γ u r κ 0 τ f where γ ur γ u r and τ ur are the current soil reaction at the onset of unloading or reloading as shown in fig 15 κ 0 is the pyke s scaling parameter pyke 1979 and the plus and minus signs denote unloading and reloading respectively for sand there was no apparent gapping between the soil and foundation when the foundation was subjected to lateral load which is different from the cohesive soil described in huang et al 2018 generally sand shows a cyclic hardening behavior under a long term cyclic load and the degradation will take place in saturated sand under undrained conditions due to the generation of excessive pore water pressure matasović and vucetic 1993 achmus et al 2009 the cyclic hardening or degradation characteristics are usually characterized by the number of load cycles or accumulated plastic shear strain vucetic 1994 lee et al 2009 in this study to demonstrate the cyclic characteristics of sand the accumulated plastic shear strain γ p and a cyclic hardening or degradation model was introduced into the hysteresis loops and the total γ p for m cycles can be calculated by a summation of the irrecoverable shear strain generated in each cycle huang and liu 2015 6 δ e δ e h 1 δ e h e b γ p 7 γ p γ p i i 1 2 3 2 m 1 2 m where b is a material parameter reflecting the rate of cyclic hardening or degradation with the accumulated shear strain δ e e s 1 e s 0 stands for the stiffness hardening or degradation factor and δ e h e s h e s 0 is defined as the residual stiffness ratio where e s 0 e s 1 and e s h are the initial elastic modulus before cyclic loading the current elastic modulus after cyclic loading and the final residual elastic modulus after cyclic loading respectively γ p i is the accumulated plastic shear strain at the ith cycle and the γ p 1 and γ p 2 are shown in fig 15 4 2 comparison between experimental and analytical results the dynamic responses of the foundation under various excitation loads and different scour depths are obtained by the simplified method mentioned above as shown in figs 7 9 here the soil parameters are determined by the rct and tst to avoid errors caused by the improper selection of soil parameters the initial small strain shear modulus of sand is calculated by eq 1 and the fitted hysteresis loops of stress strain are shown in fig 15 in which δ e h b and κ 0 are assumed to be 1 5 3 0 and 2 0 respectively similarly the peak displacement amplitude and resonant frequency calculated by the simplified method are also summarized in tables 3 4 it can be seen that the trend of the theoretical results is close to that of the experimental results the dynamic response of foundation increases with the increase of excitation force under scouring conditions adding piles beneath the caisson obviously improves the dynamic characteristics of the caisson the peak displacement and resonant frequency in numerical analyses are slightly larger than those in experiments this may be due to the assumptions that the caisson foundation is completely rigid in the simplified model and the connection between the caisson and pile group is fully fixed which are inconsistent with the model test despite the simplicity of the analysis model a reasonable match between the experimental results and theoretical results can be observed by using the soil parameters measured by rct and tst which ensures the reliability of the simplified method for better illustration the time history of displacements at the top center of caisson when the excitation force is 4 n at a resonant frequency are plotted in figs 16 18 it is clear that the curves have slightly asymmetry at the first several cycles but towards to uniform at subsequent loading cycles especially for scouring cases the main reason of this phenomenon is the soil nonlinearity developed with increasing number of load cycles the dynamic responses of foundations after scouring also indicate that piles can effectively improve the lateral dynamic performance in addition the bending stiffness of pile groups beneath the caisson in the ccpf with 4 piles is higher than that of the ccpf with 8 piles however the dynamic displacement response of the caisson with 8 piles is slightly lower than that of the with 4 piles it indicates that the design or layout of pile groups beneath the caisson may have a significant effect on the dynamic response of the composite foundation the soil stress strain hysteresis curves at different depths along the caisson shaft when the excitation force is 4 n at resonant frequency also have been obtained in figs 19 and 20 as seen in figs 19 20 the first cycle of curves has an offset compared with the loops during subsequent cycles due to the soil nonlinearity the results also show that the dynamic response of the horizontal spring becomes stiffer with the increase of depth this stems from the fact that the lateral displacements at larger depth are relatively small with respect to the ground surface in addition it is found that the stress strain hysteresis loops of caisson foundation after scouring show an obvious nonlinear characteristic due to the weakening of soil lateral restraint but the patterns of the stress strain curves of the ccpf are almost not affected by the scouring this shows the positive effect of adding piles on the lateral dynamic response from the soil mechanics perspective for further illustration the soil stress strain hysteresis curves of the ccpf foundations at pile head when the excitation force is 4 n at resonant frequency are plotted in fig 21 as seen in fig 21 although the shear strain and shear stress are relatively low the hysteresis curves exhibit similar response as the soil around the caisson shaft in figs 19 and 20 the first loading cycle also has an offset compared with the loops during subsequent cycles however the main factor causing the offset may be different from the one mentioned in figs 19 and 20 for better understanding the time histories of soil stress and strain at the pile head after scouring are shown in figs 22 and 23 according to figs 22 and 23 the main factor is that the pile head first produces a displacement opposite to the direction of horizontal excitation force and then generates a displacement in the same direction as the horizontal excitation force this reverse phenomenon in the first cycle is mainly due to the relatively small pure lateral displacement at first and the rocking displacement results in a reverse movement at the base center of the caisson however such phenomenon will disappear as the pure lateral displacement increases all the dynamic excitation tests are conducted using staged procedure in which the excitation force increases stage by stage on the same model and sufficient time interval between two tests was assured for sand consolidation however two limitations need to be addressed firstly this dynamic test performed above is a small scale model test due to the contradiction between the model scale and material selection it is difficult to determine its relationships with the prototype foundation therefore the test results were used to determine the influence of various scour depths and excitation forces on the ccpf dynamic response which is similar to a study of boominathan and ayothiraman 2005 2007b secondly the rct and tst were both carried out at relatively low effective confining pressure and the dynamic experiment conducted on ccpf is also embedded in a low effective confining pressure it is inconsistent with the engineering practice and the relative density of sand bed can be easily disturbed by the vibration which may also be the reason for the difference between the experimental and analytical results therefore the results of the dynamic test may be verified further and modified based on the full scale experiments at high effective confining pressure 5 discussions the relationships between the model and prototype foundations are a common concern in fact there is no direct equivalent relationship between the model and the prototype however the relationship can be obtained based on some assumptions as mentioned above λ n and λ ρ in this study equal 400 and 1 0 respectively λ ε equals λ n vs m vs p 2 or λ n g 0 m g 0 p in which g 0 m and g 0 p are the initial shear modulus of soil in the model and the prototype the g 0 m used in the model test is obtained by rct and tst as shown in table 5 empirically it is assumed that g 0 m g 0 p approximately equals 1 400 namely λ ε equal to 1 then the other scaling factors in this model test such as the time and stiffness can be determined based on the scaling factors of length λ n density λ ρ and strain λ ε iai et al 2005 the scaling factors for 1 g model tests are listed in table 6 according to the scaling factors listed in table 6 the resonant frequency of the model is λ n 0 5 times the resonant frequency of a prototype with the experimental results and scaling laws the dynamic displacement and resonance characteristics of the laterally loaded foundation before and after scouring can be obtained the lateral displacement amplitude of the prototype foundation may be increased significantly and even doubled after scouring based on the data listed in table 3 the resonant frequencies of the prototype foundations are calculated and shown in table 7 the results show that the resonant frequencies of the caisson foundation and ccpfs are located in the range of 0 4hz 0 9 hz it is obvious that the decrease of the resonant frequency of foundation caused by the scouring is more pronounced than that caused by an increase in the external load it should be noted that the resonant frequency of prototype foundation is oriented toward qualitative analysis since the selection of the shear modulus of soil is based on the empirical value the shear modulus of soil is very important for the dynamic response in theoretical analysis and engineering practice therefore in suit test cyclic triaxial test or resonant column test on undisturbed samples should be carried out to determine the soil dynamic properties before engineering application 6 conclusions horizontal harmonic excitation model tests were performed to study the nonlinear dynamic lateral responses of foundation under various excitation forces and scour depths three different foundation types were tested including caisson caisson with four piles and caisson with eight piles meanwhile a simplified dynamic winkler model was proposed to analyze the dynamic lateral response of the model foundations in which the nonlinear behavior of the sand can be considered the experimental results and numerical analyses were compared the following main conclusions may be drawn 1 the horizontal dynamic amplitude of the caisson and ccpfs shows a obvious nonlinear behavior during the horizontal harmonic vibration tests especially when the excitation force is large and scouring exists compared with the caisson foundation adding piles beneath the caisson base will remarkably reduce the dynamic amplitude of foundation especially around the resonant frequency meanwhile the pile configuration also shows a certain influence on the dynamic characteristics of foundation 2 the resonant frequency of the foundation decreases gradually as the excitation force and the scour depth increase indicating a nonlinear interaction between soil foundation meanwhile the experimental results show that the resonant frequency of the caisson decreases faster than that of the ccpfs 3 the results obtained by the proposed simplified nonlinear dynamic winkler model are consistent with those in the model tests the nonlinear behavior of the tested sand was measured by resonant column tests and torsional shear tests and the soil parameters in the proposed model were determined it should be noted that the accuracy of the proposed nonlinear model significantly depends on the soil parameters 4 according to the scaling laws for 1 g model tests the relationships between the model and prototype foundation are closely related to the shear

21819,this study provides empirical formulae of wave loads on quasi ellipsoid type foundations coaxially surrounded by perforated breakwaters the variation of the wave load on each structure versus wave number is characterized as a polygonal line by four key points the coordinates of these points can be directly obtained from the empirical formulae which are developed by using mathematical models in the framework of potential theory the empirical formulae can consider not only the geometric parameters and porous parameters but also the wave exposures and wave numbers comparison with the experimental results indicates that the empirical formulae can effectively determine the wave loads on the models under different wave scenarios further investigation is conducted on circular foundations which are the most distinct case of quasi ellipsoid type foundations the wave load magnitudes and phase differences are investigated by experimental and theoretical methods with the consideration of porous parameters and geometric parameters the experimental results also validate the occurrence of the phase jump when the wave loads on the breakwater are minimum empirical formulae for the distribution of the phase jump points are also presented keywords wave loads empirical formulae experiment perforated breakwater quasi ellipsoid type foundation 1 introduction cross strait railway and highway bridges are employed for high speed construction and development in china feng 2013 qin and gao 2017 as typical components for supporting the superstructures of bridges caisson foundations are frequently utilized because of their advantages of high stiffness and easy construction in view of the operation requirements of high speed trains the maximum structure vibration should be strictly limited to the safety region because a small disturbance at bridge foundations will cause a large vibration in bridge superstructures the requirement of foundation vibration will become significantly strict in ocean environment engineers prefer to build a perforated wall outside the caisson foundation as shown in fig 1 such type of structure is expected to reduce the total wave loads however how to design the breakwaters to achieve the above mentioned objective is still ambiguous the perforated structure shown in fig 1 is called jarlan type breakwater after its first engineering attempt at naples italy jarlan 1961 because of its effectiveness in reducing reflection waves jarlan type breakwaters have been widely investigated in the past years ciocan et al 2017 liu and faraci 2014 liu and li 2016 the wave reflection characteristics of the simplest form of jarlan type breakwaters which consist of a perforated front wall and a vertical impermeable back wall are controlled by two dominant factors one is the geometric porosity of the front wall and another is the relative wave chamber width b λ where b is the chamber width and λ is the incident wavelength to evaluate the effectiveness of the perforated wall reflection coefficient c r is defined and expressed as a function of porous effect parameter g wave number k and chamber width b sahoo et al 2000 the expression is generated by using linear wave theory when g is a real number previous studies indicate that c r will adopt its minimum value at b λ 0 25 0 5 n n 0 1 2 in these cases the incident waves pass through the front perforated wall without changing their wave phases in addition the waves reflected by the impermeable back wall and the incident waves at the front wall have opposite phases fugazza and natale 1992 huang et al 2011 the surface elevations on the two sides of front wall have the largest difference resulting in the largest horizontal wave force on the front wall yip and allen 2000 for oblique wave interactions with a perforated partition wall liu et al 2016 provided an analytical solution with a detail discussion on the reflection coefficients wave forces and surface amplitudes near the breakwater some factors for instance inertial effects wave nonlinearities and evanescent waves can change the value of b λ when the reflection coefficients are minimum bennett et al 1992 yang et al 1997 zhu and chwang 2001 when the thickness of breakwater is larger than the water depth the minimum reflection coefficients would occur at relatively smaller values of b λ zhu and zhu 2010 partially perforated caisson breakwaters are frequently utilized in the coastal area to minimize the reflection waves to evaluate the wave forces on such complex structures empirical formulae of the wave pressure around them are built based on numerical analytical and experimental studies takahashi s method tanimoto and takahashi 1994 which is a modification of goda s formulae goda 2010 is devised to predict the total wave forces of the breakwater at different wave phases the wave pressure along the breakwater is assumed to have a trapezoidal distribution both above and below the still water level at the bottom of the structure the uplift pressure exhibits a triangular distribution because takahashi s method does not consider the phase difference between the front perforated wall and the back structure the design by using this method tends to be conservative in tabet aoul and lambert s method tabet aoul and lambert 2003 a phase adjustment factor is introduced to correct the phase corresponding to the maximum horizontal forces on the front and back components this method also suggests the total horizontal force on the breakwater and the back caisson should be safe when 0 b λ 0 35 to obtain the phase difference between the total horizontal and the total vertical forces a series of model tests were performed on the partially perforated caisson breakwaters jiang et al 2004 li 2007 liu et al 2008 based on these data a recommended method named dut s method are provided with this method the horizontal and vertical forces on the breakwater are suggested to be designed out of phase which can enhance the stability against sliding of the perforated caissons the expressions of the three methods can be found in the review of huang et al 2011 for a cylindrical foundation the above empirical formulae devised for two dimensional 2d caissons are unsuitable for determining the wave loads in this case the foundation with a perforated breakwater forms a two layer perforated cylindrical system diffraction waves are manifest when the system is subjected to the wave actions previous analytical studies mainly focus on the mathematical modeling of the wave interactions with circular systems chen et al 2011 chuang et al 2015 kou et al 2019 mandal et al 2013 mandal and sahoo 2015 ning et al 2017 sarkar and bora 2019 2020 wang and ren 1994 williams and li 1998 2000 for the other cross sections liu et al 2018 developed an analytical method for calculating the wave forces on perforated cylindrical systems unlike flat breakwaters there is no direct induction for the design of cylindrical breakwaters an improper design could escalate the safety risk of the protected structure in a complex ocean environment therefore in this study we focus on the wave loads on quasi ellipsoid type foundations protected by cylindrical breakwaters to overcome the time consumption problem of the mathematical method and provide an easy guideline to designers this paper presents empirical formulae for the wave loads on focused foundations and breakwaters the structure of this paper is as follows in section 2 the mathematical method using potential theory for calculating the wave loads on cylindrical systems is reviewed the explanation of the variables and wave load empirical formulae are provided in this section in section 3 the experimental set up for the model tests is presented and the validation of the empirical formulae is given section 4 describes a further investigation of the wave loads on circular system finally the conclusions are presented in section 5 2 wave load empirical formulae 2 1 mathematical model this study focuses on a foundation with a quasi ellipsoid type section which combines a central rectangle of l 2 r 0 and two external half circles with a radius of r 0 as shown in fig 2 this type of cross section is frequently utilized for the foundations of cross strait bridges for example the hong kong zhuhai macao bridge china akashi kaikyo bridge japan and golden gate bridge usa when l 0 the cross section shown in fig 2 becomes to a circular section which is the most distinct case of the quasi ellipsoid type section in fig 2 the cylindrical system consists of an impermeable foundation γ 1 and a perforated breakwater γ 2 the two structures are coaxially bottom mounted on the seabed the cross section of the breakwater is also quasi ellipsoid the gap between the foundation and breakwater is uniform with a value of d for the convenience of building the mathematic model the x y plane is set at the still water level swl and its origin is inside the cross section of the foundation the z axis is perpendicular to the swl and positive upward in fig 2 the fluid domain is divided into two subdomains ω j j 1 2 by the boundaries γ j j 1 2 the system is exposed to a regular wave with frequency ω wave amplitude a water depth h and exposure angle α in the mathematical model the boundary for the breakwater is considered to be of thin in thickness and its porosity is homogeneous in this study ideal fluid is used for the mathematic model the velocity potential of the fluid in each subdomain satisfies laplace s equation and the corresponding boundary conditions the governing equation and boundary conditions for the velocity potential φ j j 1 2 in domain ω j j 1 2 are summarized as laplace s equation 1 2 φ j 0 j 1 2 linear free surface condition z 0 2 φ j z ω 2 g φ j 0 j 1 2 where g is the gravity acceleration seabed condition z h 3 φ j z 0 j 1 2 body conditions 4 γ 1 φ 1 n 1 0 5 γ 2 φ 1 n 2 φ 2 n 2 i k g φ 1 φ 2 where n j j 1 2 is the normal vector on surface γ j and g is the porous parameter of the outer breakwater its form is given by yu 1995 6 g ε k δ f i s where k is the wave number having a relationship of ω 2 k g tanh k h ε and δ are the porosity and thickness of the breakwater respectively f is the linear porous resistance coefficient and s is the inertia coefficient here a new function is defined as 7 σ ε r 0 δ f i s to evaluate g then eq 6 is rewritten as 8 g σ k r 0 details about how to determine φ j j 1 2 can be found in the study of liu et al 2018 then the hydrodynamic pressure can be obtained by 9 p j i ρ ω φ j j 1 2 where ρ is the water density the wave force in the direction of n f which is the unit vector in the force direction can be given by 10 γ j f j h 0 γ j p j 1 p j n j n f d s d z j 1 2 and the base bending moment is 11 γ j m j h 0 γ j z h p j 1 p j n j n f d s d z j 1 2 where p 0 0 the dimensionless wave force and base bending moment on the boundary γ j are defined as 12 f j f j a m 4 ρ g a r 0 2 tanh k h 13 m j k cosh k h m j a m 4 ρ g a r 0 2 k h sinh k h 1 cosh k h where f j a m and m j a m are the amplitude of the wave force and base bending moment obtained by eqs 10 and 11 the reason for utilizing the forms of eqs 12 and 13 is that the dimensionless wave force and base bending moment can share the same empirical formulae as proven in appendix a furthermore by using these forms the wave loads are independent of the water depth and only rely on the variables of k r 0 d r l r α and σ 2 2 variable explanation to easily obtain the wave force and base bending moment without calculating the bessel functions the curve of the wave load versus k r 0 is treated as a polygonal line characterized by four key points the coordinates of these points are 0 0 a1 b2 a2 b3 a3 and 3 0 a4 as shown in fig 3 where a is for the inner foundation and b is for the outer breakwater in fig 3 b there is an important point in the range of 0 0 b2 and it is represented by c1 d2 where d2 is the value of f 2 at k r 0 c 1 and c1 is the coordinate corresponding to the local maximum value of f 2 a m ρ g a in 0 0 b2 the reason for picking out this point is because f 2 a m is the wave force used for the final design and the local maximum value of f 2 a m ρ g a in this region should be accurately predicted although the value of a1 can be much larger than the analytical results at k r 0 0 0 the over prediction of f 2 is acceptable in practical applications this is because tanh k h 0 at k r 0 0 0 resulting in the value of f 2 a m ρ g a solved by eq 12 equals to 0 at this point furthermore the prediction of f 2 in the region of 0 0 c1 will be conservative by solving the mathematical model the wave loads on the two structures with different variable groups of k r 0 d r l r α and σ are obtained the effective ranges of these parameters are listed in table 1 the parameter σ used for quantifying the porous parameter g of the breakwater is set as a real number which implies s 0 therefore σ has two thresholds σ 0 ε 0 and σ f 0 when σ 0 the breakwater is impermeable when σ the breakwater has no effect on the water waves and vanishes theoretically in both cases the cylindrical system can be treated as a single impermeable cylinder in this study the effective range of σ for the presented system does not include these two specific values and it is 0 25 5 which can meet most of engineering requirements when σ 5 the empirical formulae for the inner foundation are still effective and can yield acceptable predictions however the predicted results for the breakwater will be much higher than the analytical results the wave loads on a single impermeable cylinder can be obtained from the formulae of the inner foundation by setting a large value for σ when σ 0 25 the empirical formulae will fail to predict the wave loads for both the foundation and breakwater when d r 0 0 the breakwater will coincide with the foundation the velocity in the normal direction of the breakwater is zero then eq 5 becomes 14 φ 1 n 2 φ 2 n 2 i k g φ 1 φ 2 0 which indicates that φ 1 φ 2 at the breakwater and the pressures obtained by eq 9 at the two sides of the breakwater are equal this implies that the wave action on the breakwater is zero in conclusion as d r 0 0 the effect of the breakwater vanishes and the wave loads on the inner foundation become equal to the result of single foundation it should be noticed that the effects of the fluid viscosity friction of the boundaries and surface tension are significant when d r 0 is extremely small in this case potential theory is no longer adequate to analyze the flow characteristics between the boundaries however as d r 0 0 the exact results of the wave force can still be obtained by 15 f 1 ε f s i n n e r f 2 1 ε f s i n n e r where f s i n n e r is the wave force on the single foundation without a breakwater the base bending moment can be obtained in the same way because the dimensionless wave force and base bending moment are identical only the wave force on the cylindrical system was calculated by resolving the mathematical model for different variable combinations more than 2000 wave force curves were obtained the details for the determination of the key point coordinates are foundation i a1 and a4 are set to the value of f 1 as k r 0 0 0 and k r 0 3 0 respectively ii b2 a2 and b3 a3 are determined by fitting the best f 1 in the least squares sense breakwater i b2 a2 is the point when the minimum f 2 on the breakwater occurs ii a4 is set to the value of f 2 as k r 0 3 0 iii obtain the local maximum value of f 2 a m ρ g a in the range of 0 0 b2 and label this point by c1 d1 then d2 is the value of f 2 obtained at k r 0 c 1 iv a1 is set to the y intercept of the straight line passing through b2 a2 and c1 d2 v b3 a3 is determined by fitting the best f 2 in the least squares sense after obtaining the coordinates of the key points from analytical results the empirical formulae of these coordinates were built with the variables by regression analysis in this process an analysis was conducted first to determine the sensibility of k r 0 d r l r α and σ for each coordinate then the expression of each coordinate was built by the dominant variables with undetermined coefficients which were resolved by using the least square method after that the undetermined coefficients were adjusted slightly to make the results conservative in the following the wave forces on the foundation and breakwater along the x and y axes are symbolized by f 1 x f 1 y f 2 x and f 2 y respectively similarly the symbols of the base bending moments are m 1 x m 1 y m 2 x and m 2 y with the forms of eqs 12 13 they have the relations of f 1 x m 1 y f 1 y m 1 x f 2 x m 2 y and f 2 y m 2 x 2 3 empirical formulae eqs 16 21 are the empirical formulae for the key points of f 1 x and eqs 22 27 are the same for f 1 y these formulae indicate that f 1 x and f 1 y can share the same expression of bi i 2 3 which are independent of σ and d r 0 for the other coordinates ai i 1 2 3 are dependent on all the variables and ai i 4 is dependent on σ α and l r 0 the key point coordinates for f 1 x are

were performed at the wind tunnel and wave flume laboratory with two types of cylindrical system circular system cs and quasi ellipsoid system qes in this study model tests were also conducted with the two types of single foundation the wave flume has a width of 5 m and a length of 50 m water depth is 0 8 m the wave parameters for the regular waves are listed in table 2 seven different wave periods were applied in the physical model tests the wave steepness for the periods of 0 6 s 0 7 s 0 8 s and 1 0 s is 0 024 and for the periods of 1 2 s 1 5 s and 2 0 s is 0 010 when t 0 7 s three other wave steepness levels are supplemented to investigate the effect of wave steepness on the wave loads the detailed geometric parameters for the foundations and breakwaters of cs and qes are listed in table 3 with the wave periods listed in table 2 there are seven values of k r 0 in the range of 0 k r 0 3 for qes to catch the variation of the wave loads on foundation and breakwater for cs there are six values of k r 0 in 0 k r 0 3 the shape of the hole on the breakwater is rectangular as shown in fig 2 the porosity ε of the breakwater is calculated by 40 ε s p s w s p where s w and s p are the areas in a unit section of the solid wall and hole a schematic for the model installation is shown in fig 4 the test models were bottom mounted on a turntable which can rotate to change the wave exposures by 0 22 5 45 67 5 and 90 the wave force and base bending moment were measured by force balances which were installed at the bottom of the inner and breakwater respectively the array of force balances is displayed in fig 4 close up images of the test models are depicted in fig 5 3 2 validation to determine the porous parameter g for the test models the values of inertia coefficient s and porous resistance coefficient f need to be evaluated previous studies li et al 2006 yu 1995 suggests s 1 for most practical problems further case studies have found that the results derived from s 1 and s 0 have little difference because the phase differences of the forces between the foundation and breakwater are not considered in this part s 0 is adopted which can ensure σ is a real parameter the value of f is approximately evaluated by the empirical formulae of li et al 2006 41 f 3338 7 δ h 2 82 769 δ h 8 711 then the value of g for a given perforated breakwater can be obtained from eq 7 with known porous resistance coefficient f and inertial coefficient s the wave loads on a single circular foundation and a single quasi ellipsoid foundation are predicted by empirical formulae with σ 1000 the comparison of the experimental analytical and empirical formulae results for a single circular foundation is shown in fig 6 a and b these subfigures exhibit that the empirical formulae can successfully represent the analytical results and both of them are adequate to predict the experimental results for the results of the cs l the predictions are good by both analytical method and empirical formulae as displayed in fig 6 c f in the frame of potential theory when the foundation is symmetric about the axis in the wave propagating direction the wave forces on the structures in transverse direction are zero however some unexpected factors can still cause asymmetric fluctuations because the transverse wave loads on the foundation or breakwater are generally small 10 of the wave loads in the propagation direction are utilized to predict the transverse forces because the wave steepness used here is generally low the linear wave theory is adequate to analyze the wave interaction with a perforated cylindrical system furthermore the empirical formulae based on the analytical method are reasonable because the empirical formulae are built conservatively f 2 x and m 2 y predicted by the empirical formulae in fig 6 e and f are better than that of analytical results with the comparison of experimental results when k r 0 is small in previous study of liu et al 2018 the experimental results show that the wave force on the breakwater will increase with the increasing wave steepness however the predicted results by empirical formulae are independent of the wave steepness to adjust the predicted results for the cases with larger wave steepness a larger value of f is suggested because the conclusion is same as that of cs l only part of wave load results for single quasi ellipsoid foundation and qes l are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 these figures illustrate that the empirical formulae can efficiently predict the wave loads on the foundation and breakwater with the variation in the geometry parameter and wave exposures the purpose for constructing the outer breakwater is to reduce the wave loads on the inner foundation the effective range of the breakwater can be evaluated by f 1 f s i n n e r where f s i n n e r is the wave force on the single foundation without a breakwater in practical applications the two structures are frequently connected as a unit however the phase difference of wave forces between the foundation and breakwater with a quasi ellipsoid section is highly affected by the wave parameters and geometric parameters for most cases the wave forces on the two structures are not synchronous and the total wave force can be conservatively obtained by f 1 2 f 2 2 for all the cases then the effective range can be evaluated by the cases of f 1 2 f 2 2 f s i n n e r as to cs there are more interesting rules for the phase difference of wave forces therefore it is worth to give a further investigate on the wave loads of cs 4 further investigation of cs 4 1 wave forces on cs fig 9 shows the time histories of the wave forces on the foundation and breakwater in the x direction for different model tests as a comparison the wave forces on a single circular foundation are also presented synchronously with the results of cs l and cs s for the cases of t 0 6 s and t 0 7 s the existence of breakwater significantly reduces the wave forces on inner foundation particularly at the trough of the wave forces as presented in fig 9 a and b for these two cases the decreasing porosity leads a decrease in the wave forces on the inner foundation and an increase in the wave forces on the outer breakwater for the cases of t 0 8 s and t 1 0 s the wave forces on the inner foundation are larger than the results of single circular foundation as depicted in fig 9 c and d the comparison results illustrate that the breakwater can increase the wave loads on the inner structures in specific wave cases it is important to note that an improper design of the breakwater could enlarge the wave forces on inner structures and a higher porosity of the breakwater could further deteriorate the results for the cases of t 1 2 s t 1 5 s and t 2 0 s the wave forces on inner foundation and single circular foundation are almost coincident as shown in fig 9 e f and g the effect of outer breakwater on inner foundation can be neglected however the wave force variation of breakwater versus the wave period is significant the wave forces on the outer breakwater are close to zero at t 1 2 s with a further increase in the wave period the wave forces on the outer breakwater increase significantly fig 9 also illustrates that the wave forces on breakwater are advance compared with the force curves of inner foundation when t 0 6 s t 0 7 s t 0 8 s and t 1 0 s on the contrary they are hysteresis when t 1 5 s and t 2 0 s fig 10 shows the phase difference δ ϕ between the force curves of the outer breakwater and inner foundation where the force curves of inner foundation are taken as the reference in this figure the analytical results of δ ϕ for the concerned model are displayed together the analytical results are obtained in the framework of the potential theory in fig 10 the analytical results of δ ϕ consist of two horizontal lines in the region of 0 k r 0 4 and they are independent of the value of k r 0 except a phase jump around k r 0 0 86 the difference in the two horizontal lines is π the phase jump appears when the value of the wave force on outer breakwater is minimum analytical investigation finds that the values of δ ϕ are independent of the parameters of ε and δ they are only determined by the ratio of s and f because s does not have an explicit formula for the present models two values of s f 0 and 0 56 are selected as examples when s f 0 the results of δ ϕ corresponding to the low and high horizontal lines are equal to π 2 and π 2 respectively with increasing s f both the horizontal lines will increase synchronously and equally their difference will always remain π another important characteristic of the phase jump point is that k r 0 corresponding to it is independent of the porous parameter g the dominant parameters of it are k r 0 and d the detailed analysis of this characteristic is presented in section 4 2 in fig 10 the comparison of experimental results and analytical results shows that analytical results will underestimate the value of δ ϕ when s f 0 generally s f 0 56 can provide more acceptable results the experimental results demonstrate the existence of the phase jump phenomenon however the variation of δ ϕ is not as sharp as the results predicted by the analytical method it should be noticed that there also exists the phenomenon of phase jump in the cases of qes l the difference is that the values of δ ϕ is no longer constant and is highly affected by k r 0 fig 11 shows the wave force amplitudes on inner foundation and outer breakwater which have been divided by the force amplitude of single foundation the amplitude from the experimental results is set as half of the difference between the crest and trough of the wave forces in fig 11 a the wave forces on the inner foundation are less sensitive to the breakwater when k r 0 is small which has been described in fig 9 it is important to note that the wave protection of breakwater on inner foundation with a low k r 0 is invalid when t 0 8 s the wave force ratio could be even much larger than 1 the purpose of reducing the wave force on inner foundation can only be achieved when k r 0 is large concurrently a low porosity can further benefit the reduction in the wave force on inner foundation fig 11 b shows that a low porosity can significantly increase the wave force on outer breakwater to provide a clear illustration of when the breakwaters are effective fig 12 presents the force ratios for different d r 0 obtained by mathematical model apparently the force ratio results depend on the values of f and s as an example f 8 9744 and s 0 are adopted for the following analysis in fig 12 a the curves lower than 1 are the effective regions for the protection of breakwater it shows that increasing d r 0 can lead to a larger effective region and a smaller force ratio another characteristic is that the force ratios reach 1 when the wave loads on breakwater become minimum where the phase jump occurs in some cases the breakwater is connected with the foundation as a unit hence it is relevant to study the total wave forces on the two structures as shown in fig 12 b the force ratio results shown here have a similar tendency to that of the force ratio of inner foundation but they are limited in the range of 0 75 1 00 for the present cases with a small k r 0 the force ratio could be slightly larger than 1 as d r 0 1 00 in summary the breakwater is only effective in cases of large k r 0 the wave loads on the inner foundation can be reduced significantly by increasing d r 0 the design of a breakwater should be conducted away from the phase jump points fig 13 exhibits the power spectral density psd results when t 0 7 s at different wave steepness levels by comparing the psd results of cs l and cs s it is easy to find that the component of second order wave forces on inner foundations increases with increasing wave steepness at the same wave steepness level the second order wave force on inner foundation of cs s is larger than that of cs l indicating that decreasing porosity can enhance the high order wave actions on the inner foundation for both cs l and cs s the second order wave forces on outer breakwater are not significant this conclusion is supported by the historical curves of wave force shown in fig 9 which illustrates that the wave forces on breakwater are much smoother than those on inner foundation 4 2 phase jump points for cs a schematic of the wave loads on the breakwater versus k r 0 is shown in fig 14 where q i i 1 2 represents the minimum points and δ i i 1 2 represents the intervals between two adjacent points the analytical results have proven that the phase jump occurs when the breakwater reaches its minimum points and the jump value at this point is always equals to π in theory in section 2 3 a rough prediction formula for q 1 is already given in eqs 32 and 38 in this subsection more accurate formulae of q 1 and δ i are provided for cs the analytical expression of the wave force on the breakwater is given by wang and ren 1994 42 f 2 abs π s 1 γ π k r 0 2 h 1 γ k r 0 s 1 i 2 g k r 0 h 1 k r 0 43 s 1 j 1 k r 0 y 1 γ k r 0 j 1 γ k r 0 y 1 k r 0 where j 1 and y 1 are first order derivations of j 1 and y 1 which are the bessel functions of the first type and second type respectively h 1 is the hankel function having a relationship of h 1 j 1 i y 1 and parameter γ 1 d r 0 eq 42 indicates that the minimum points occur only if s 1 0 at these points the wave forces on breakwater are zero different from cs the results of qes show that the wave forces at these minimum points do not have such a rule in most cases the wave forces on the breakwater at the minimum points are slightly larger than zero go back to cs a new function is defined as 44 γ κ y 1 κ j 1 κ in eq 44 it is assumed that j 1 κ 0 for the case of j 1 κ 0 one can use 1 γ κ instead of γ κ for the same analysis fig 15 shows the variation of γ κ versus κ in this figure the asymptotic lines correspond to the value of κ as j 1 κ 0 infinite domains are divided by these asymptotic lines and only four of them are shown in this figure in domain i γ κ decreases with increasing κ until it reaches a trough at the trough the value of κ can be proven to be 1 for the other domains γ κ increases monotonically with increasing κ the values of k r 0 corresponding to q i are the solutions of 45 γ k r 0 γ γ k r 0 from fig 15 the solution of q 1 can be found in domain i with k r 0 1 and γ k r 0 1 in this domain both k r 0 and γ k r 0 converge to the trough point as γ 1 the figure also illustrates that the value of k r 0 corresponding to q 1 is always less than 1 for the solutions of q i i 2 k r 0 and γ k r 0 are located in two different adjacent domains an important characteristic of γ κ is that γ κ tan κ π 4 as κ this implies that γ κ will become a period function as κ is sufficiently large and q i i will also appear periodically therefore for a certain γ δ i will converge to a constant as i because of the complexity of bessel functions explicit formulae of q 1 and δ i from eq 45 are unavailable therefore the fitting approach is still the best method for building the empirical formulae of q 1 and δ i by solving the mathematic model the wave loads on the foundation and breakwaters for different d r are obtained then k r 0 corresponding to q i are selected and the empirical formulae of q 1 and δ i are generated it should be noticed that q 1 and δ i are determined with wave loads in the forms of eqs 12 and 13 concurrently further investigation reveals that their values are only determined by the geometry parameter and are not affected by the water depth and porous parameter g generalizing from the analytical results the value of k r 0 for q 1 can be formulated as 46 q 1 k r 0 2 089 2 089 d r 0 the formulae of δ i i 1 2 3 are given by 47 δ 1 k r 0 2 652 d r 0 1 07 48 δ 2 k r 0 3 036 d r 0 1 042 49 δ 3 k r 0 3 107 d r 0 1 018 the effective range of d r 0 for eq 46 49 is 0 4 in fig 16 the fitting results of eq 46 can successfully predict the variation in q 1 with increasing d r 0 it shows that the results of k r 0 reach 1 as d r 0 0 the reason for this is already presented above eqs 32 and 38 can also provide acceptable results in their effective range out of this range they are no longer accurate and will cause a large error with a large d r 0 fig 17 shows the analytical results and fitting results of δ i versus d r 0 it illustrates that δ i will sharply increase to an infinite value as d r 0 decreases to 0 it also points out that δ 1 has the smallest value compared to δ i i 2 for the same d r 0 for the interval δ i i 3 and 4 their values are very close since δ i for a certain d r 0 will converge to a constant when i is sufficiently large the formula of δ 3 is applicable for δ i i 4 5 conclusion in this study empirical formulae for the wave loads on the foundation and breakwater with a quasi ellipsoid section are provided the variation curves of the wave loads versus different wave numbers are simplified as polygonal lines which are characterized by four key points benefiting from this the wave loads can be rapidly obtained from the interpolated values between two key points avoiding calculating the bessel functions the geometry parameters porous parameters wave numbers and wave exposures are considered in the empirical formulae within their effective range to validate the empirical formulae and provide a further understating of the wave loads model tests are conducted on quasi ellipsoid type foundation with the protection of cylindrical breakwaters the main findings of this study are 1 model tests in the wave flume on cylindrical systems with two types of sections circular section and quasi ellipsoid section confirm that the empirical formulae can successfully predict the wave loads on the quasi ellipsoid type cylindrical system the wave loads on a single quasi ellipsoid foundation can also be evaluated by the empirical formulae using a large σ 2 wave load protection of the breakwater on inner foundation is only effective in the large k r 0 region in the small k r 0 region the wave loads on inner foundation almost equal to those on the single foundation and the existence of the breakwater has less effect on the foundation in the large k r 0 region the decreasing porosity of the breakwater can efficiently reduce the wave loads on inner foundation 3 the phase jump occurs at the points where the wave loads on the breakwater are minimum these minimum points are mainly controlled by the geometric parameters of the structure for a circular system the distribution of these minimum points is approximately uniformly spaced after the third minimum point the design of a cylindrical breakwater is expected to avoid the phase jump points credit authorship contribution statement jiabin liu conceptualization methodology

21819,this study provides empirical formulae of wave loads on quasi ellipsoid type foundations coaxially surrounded by perforated breakwaters the variation of the wave load on each structure versus wave number is characterized as a polygonal line by four key points the coordinates of these points can be directly obtained from the empirical formulae which are developed by using mathematical models in the framework of potential theory the empirical formulae can consider not only the geometric parameters and porous parameters but also the wave exposures and wave numbers comparison with the experimental results indicates that the empirical formulae can effectively determine the wave loads on the models under different wave scenarios further investigation is conducted on circular foundations which are the most distinct case of quasi ellipsoid type foundations the wave load magnitudes and phase differences are investigated by experimental and theoretical methods with the consideration of porous parameters and geometric parameters the experimental results also validate the occurrence of the phase jump when the wave loads on the breakwater are minimum empirical formulae for the distribution of the phase jump points are also presented keywords wave loads empirical formulae experiment perforated breakwater quasi ellipsoid type foundation 1 introduction cross strait railway and highway bridges are employed for high speed construction and development in china feng 2013 qin and gao 2017 as typical components for supporting the superstructures of bridges caisson foundations are frequently utilized because of their advantages of high stiffness and easy construction in view of the operation requirements of high speed trains the maximum structure vibration should be strictly limited to the safety region because a small disturbance at bridge foundations will cause a large vibration in bridge superstructures the requirement of foundation vibration will become significantly strict in ocean environment engineers prefer to build a perforated wall outside the caisson foundation as shown in fig 1 such type of structure is expected to reduce the total wave loads however how to design the breakwaters to achieve the above mentioned objective is still ambiguous the perforated structure shown in fig 1 is called jarlan type breakwater after its first engineering attempt at naples italy jarlan 1961 because of its effectiveness in reducing reflection waves jarlan type breakwaters have been widely investigated in the past years ciocan et al 2017 liu and faraci 2014 liu and li 2016 the wave reflection characteristics of the simplest form of jarlan type breakwaters which consist of a perforated front wall and a vertical impermeable back wall are controlled by two dominant factors one is the geometric porosity of the front wall and another is the relative wave chamber width b λ where b is the chamber width and λ is the incident wavelength to evaluate the effectiveness of the perforated wall reflection coefficient c r is defined and expressed as a function of porous effect parameter g wave number k and chamber width b sahoo et al 2000 the expression is generated by using linear wave theory when g is a real number previous studies indicate that c r will adopt its minimum value at b λ 0 25 0 5 n n 0 1 2 in these cases the incident waves pass through the front perforated wall without changing their wave phases in addition the waves reflected by the impermeable back wall and the incident waves at the front wall have opposite phases fugazza and natale 1992 huang et al 2011 the surface elevations on the two sides of front wall have the largest difference resulting in the largest horizontal wave force on the front wall yip and allen 2000 for oblique wave interactions with a perforated partition wall liu et al 2016 provided an analytical solution with a detail discussion on the reflection coefficients wave forces and surface amplitudes near the breakwater some factors for instance inertial effects wave nonlinearities and evanescent waves can change the value of b λ when the reflection coefficients are minimum bennett et al 1992 yang et al 1997 zhu and chwang 2001 when the thickness of breakwater is larger than the water depth the minimum reflection coefficients would occur at relatively smaller values of b λ zhu and zhu 2010 partially perforated caisson breakwaters are frequently utilized in the coastal area to minimize the reflection waves to evaluate the wave forces on such complex structures empirical formulae of the wave pressure around them are built based on numerical analytical and experimental studies takahashi s method tanimoto and takahashi 1994 which is a modification of goda s formulae goda 2010 is devised to predict the total wave forces of the breakwater at different wave phases the wave pressure along the breakwater is assumed to have a trapezoidal distribution both above and below the still water level at the bottom of the structure the uplift pressure exhibits a triangular distribution because takahashi s method does not consider the phase difference between the front perforated wall and the back structure the design by using this method tends to be conservative in tabet aoul and lambert s method tabet aoul and lambert 2003 a phase adjustment factor is introduced to correct the phase corresponding to the maximum horizontal forces on the front and back components this method also suggests the total horizontal force on the breakwater and the back caisson should be safe when 0 b λ 0 35 to obtain the phase difference between the total horizontal and the total vertical forces a series of model tests were performed on the partially perforated caisson breakwaters jiang et al 2004 li 2007 liu et al 2008 based on these data a recommended method named dut s method are provided with this method the horizontal and vertical forces on the breakwater are suggested to be designed out of phase which can enhance the stability against sliding of the perforated caissons the expressions of the three methods can be found in the review of huang et al 2011 for a cylindrical foundation the above empirical formulae devised for two dimensional 2d caissons are unsuitable for determining the wave loads in this case the foundation with a perforated breakwater forms a two layer perforated cylindrical system diffraction waves are manifest when the system is subjected to the wave actions previous analytical studies mainly focus on the mathematical modeling of the wave interactions with circular systems chen et al 2011 chuang et al 2015 kou et al 2019 mandal et al 2013 mandal and sahoo 2015 ning et al 2017 sarkar and bora 2019 2020 wang and ren 1994 williams and li 1998 2000 for the other cross sections liu et al 2018 developed an analytical method for calculating the wave forces on perforated cylindrical systems unlike flat breakwaters there is no direct induction for the design of cylindrical breakwaters an improper design could escalate the safety risk of the protected structure in a complex ocean environment therefore in this study we focus on the wave loads on quasi ellipsoid type foundations protected by cylindrical breakwaters to overcome the time consumption problem of the mathematical method and provide an easy guideline to designers this paper presents empirical formulae for the wave loads on focused foundations and breakwaters the structure of this paper is as follows in section 2 the mathematical method using potential theory for calculating the wave loads on cylindrical systems is reviewed the explanation of the variables and wave load empirical formulae are provided in this section in section 3 the experimental set up for the model tests is presented and the validation of the empirical formulae is given section 4 describes a further investigation of the wave loads on circular system finally the conclusions are presented in section 5 2 wave load empirical formulae 2 1 mathematical model this study focuses on a foundation with a quasi ellipsoid type section which combines a central rectangle of l 2 r 0 and two external half circles with a radius of r 0 as shown in fig 2 this type of cross section is frequently utilized for the foundations of cross strait bridges for example the hong kong zhuhai macao bridge china akashi kaikyo bridge japan and golden gate bridge usa when l 0 the cross section shown in fig 2 becomes to a circular section which is the most distinct case of the quasi ellipsoid type section in fig 2 the cylindrical system consists of an impermeable foundation γ 1 and a perforated breakwater γ 2 the two structures are coaxially bottom mounted on the seabed the cross section of the breakwater is also quasi ellipsoid the gap between the foundation and breakwater is uniform with a value of d for the convenience of building the mathematic model the x y plane is set at the still water level swl and its origin is inside the cross section of the foundation the z axis is perpendicular to the swl and positive upward in fig 2 the fluid domain is divided into two subdomains ω j j 1 2 by the boundaries γ j j 1 2 the system is exposed to a regular wave with frequency ω wave amplitude a water depth h and exposure angle α in the mathematical model the boundary for the breakwater is considered to be of thin in thickness and its porosity is homogeneous in this study ideal fluid is used for the mathematic model the velocity potential of the fluid in each subdomain satisfies laplace s equation and the corresponding boundary conditions the governing equation and boundary conditions for the velocity potential φ j j 1 2 in domain ω j j 1 2 are summarized as laplace s equation 1 2 φ j 0 j 1 2 linear free surface condition z 0 2 φ j z ω 2 g φ j 0 j 1 2 where g is the gravity acceleration seabed condition z h 3 φ j z 0 j 1 2 body conditions 4 γ 1 φ 1 n 1 0 5 γ 2 φ 1 n 2 φ 2 n 2 i k g φ 1 φ 2 where n j j 1 2 is the normal vector on surface γ j and g is the porous parameter of the outer breakwater its form is given by yu 1995 6 g ε k δ f i s where k is the wave number having a relationship of ω 2 k g tanh k h ε and δ are the porosity and thickness of the breakwater respectively f is the linear porous resistance coefficient and s is the inertia coefficient here a new function is defined as 7 σ ε r 0 δ f i s to evaluate g then eq 6 is rewritten as 8 g σ k r 0 details about how to determine φ j j 1 2 can be found in the study of liu et al 2018 then the hydrodynamic pressure can be obtained by 9 p j i ρ ω φ j j 1 2 where ρ is the water density the wave force in the direction of n f which is the unit vector in the force direction can be given by 10 γ j f j h 0 γ j p j 1 p j n j n f d s d z j 1 2 and the base bending moment is 11 γ j m j h 0 γ j z h p j 1 p j n j n f d s d z j 1 2 where p 0 0 the dimensionless wave force and base bending moment on the boundary γ j are defined as 12 f j f j a m 4 ρ g a r 0 2 tanh k h 13 m j k cosh k h m j a m 4 ρ g a r 0 2 k h sinh k h 1 cosh k h where f j a m and m j a m are the amplitude of the wave force and base bending moment obtained by eqs 10 and 11 the reason for utilizing the forms of eqs 12 and 13 is that the dimensionless wave force and base bending moment can share the same empirical formulae as proven in appendix a furthermore by using these forms the wave loads are independent of the water depth and only rely on the variables of k r 0 d r l r α and σ 2 2 variable explanation to easily obtain the wave force and base bending moment without calculating the bessel functions the curve of the wave load versus k r 0 is treated as a polygonal line characterized by four key points the coordinates of these points are 0 0 a1 b2 a2 b3 a3 and 3 0 a4 as shown in fig 3 where a is for the inner foundation and b is for the outer breakwater in fig 3 b there is an important point in the range of 0 0 b2 and it is represented by c1 d2 where d2 is the value of f 2 at k r 0 c 1 and c1 is the coordinate corresponding to the local maximum value of f 2 a m ρ g a in 0 0 b2 the reason for picking out this point is because f 2 a m is the wave force used for the final design and the local maximum value of f 2 a m ρ g a in this region should be accurately predicted although the value of a1 can be much larger than the analytical results at k r 0 0 0 the over prediction of f 2 is acceptable in practical applications this is because tanh k h 0 at k r 0 0 0 resulting in the value of f 2 a m ρ g a solved by eq 12 equals to 0 at this point furthermore the prediction of f 2 in the region of 0 0 c1 will be conservative by solving the mathematical model the wave loads on the two structures with different variable groups of k r 0 d r l r α and σ are obtained the effective ranges of these parameters are listed in table 1 the parameter σ used for quantifying the porous parameter g of the breakwater is set as a real number which implies s 0 therefore σ has two thresholds σ 0 ε 0 and σ f 0 when σ 0 the breakwater is impermeable when σ the breakwater has no effect on the water waves and vanishes theoretically in both cases the cylindrical system can be treated as a single impermeable cylinder in this study the effective range of σ for the presented system does not include these two specific values and it is 0 25 5 which can meet most of engineering requirements when σ 5 the empirical formulae for the inner foundation are still effective and can yield acceptable predictions however the predicted results for the breakwater will be much higher than the analytical results the wave loads on a single impermeable cylinder can be obtained from the formulae of the inner foundation by setting a large value for σ when σ 0 25 the empirical formulae will fail to predict the wave loads for both the foundation and breakwater when d r 0 0 the breakwater will coincide with the foundation the velocity in the normal direction of the breakwater is zero then eq 5 becomes 14 φ 1 n 2 φ 2 n 2 i k g φ 1 φ 2 0 which indicates that φ 1 φ 2 at the breakwater and the pressures obtained by eq 9 at the two sides of the breakwater are equal this implies that the wave action on the breakwater is zero in conclusion as d r 0 0 the effect of the breakwater vanishes and the wave loads on the inner foundation become equal to the result of single foundation it should be noticed that the effects of the fluid viscosity friction of the boundaries and surface tension are significant when d r 0 is extremely small in this case potential theory is no longer adequate to analyze the flow characteristics between the boundaries however as d r 0 0 the exact results of the wave force can still be obtained by 15 f 1 ε f s i n n e r f 2 1 ε f s i n n e r where f s i n n e r is the wave force on the single foundation without a breakwater the base bending moment can be obtained in the same way because the dimensionless wave force and base bending moment are identical only the wave force on the cylindrical system was calculated by resolving the mathematical model for different variable combinations more than 2000 wave force curves were obtained the details for the determination of the key point coordinates are foundation i a1 and a4 are set to the value of f 1 as k r 0 0 0 and k r 0 3 0 respectively ii b2 a2 and b3 a3 are determined by fitting the best f 1 in the least squares sense breakwater i b2 a2 is the point when the minimum f 2 on the breakwater occurs ii a4 is set to the value of f 2 as k r 0 3 0 iii obtain the local maximum value of f 2 a m ρ g a in the range of 0 0 b2 and label this point by c1 d1 then d2 is the value of f 2 obtained at k r 0 c 1 iv a1 is set to the y intercept of the straight line passing through b2 a2 and c1 d2 v b3 a3 is determined by fitting the best f 2 in the least squares sense after obtaining the coordinates of the key points from analytical results the empirical formulae of these coordinates were built with the variables by regression analysis in this process an analysis was conducted first to determine the sensibility of k r 0 d r l r α and σ for each coordinate then the expression of each coordinate was built by the dominant variables with undetermined coefficients which were resolved by using the least square method after that the undetermined coefficients were adjusted slightly to make the results conservative in the following the wave forces on the foundation and breakwater along the x and y axes are symbolized by f 1 x f 1 y f 2 x and f 2 y respectively similarly the symbols of the base bending moments are m 1 x m 1 y m 2 x and m 2 y with the forms of eqs 12 13 they have the relations of f 1 x m 1 y f 1 y m 1 x f 2 x m 2 y and f 2 y m 2 x 2 3 empirical formulae eqs 16 21 are the empirical formulae for the key points of f 1 x and eqs 22 27 are the same for f 1 y these formulae indicate that f 1 x and f 1 y can share the same expression of bi i 2 3 which are independent of σ and d r 0 for the other coordinates ai i 1 2 3 are dependent on all the variables and ai i 4 is dependent on σ α and l r 0 the key point coordinates for f 1 x are

were performed at the wind tunnel and wave flume laboratory with two types of cylindrical system circular system cs and quasi ellipsoid system qes in this study model tests were also conducted with the two types of single foundation the wave flume has a width of 5 m and a length of 50 m water depth is 0 8 m the wave parameters for the regular waves are listed in table 2 seven different wave periods were applied in the physical model tests the wave steepness for the periods of 0 6 s 0 7 s 0 8 s and 1 0 s is 0 024 and for the periods of 1 2 s 1 5 s and 2 0 s is 0 010 when t 0 7 s three other wave steepness levels are supplemented to investigate the effect of wave steepness on the wave loads the detailed geometric parameters for the foundations and breakwaters of cs and qes are listed in table 3 with the wave periods listed in table 2 there are seven values of k r 0 in the range of 0 k r 0 3 for qes to catch the variation of the wave loads on foundation and breakwater for cs there are six values of k r 0 in 0 k r 0 3 the shape of the hole on the breakwater is rectangular as shown in fig 2 the porosity ε of the breakwater is calculated by 40 ε s p s w s p where s w and s p are the areas in a unit section of the solid wall and hole a schematic for the model installation is shown in fig 4 the test models were bottom mounted on a turntable which can rotate to change the wave exposures by 0 22 5 45 67 5 and 90 the wave force and base bending moment were measured by force balances which were installed at the bottom of the inner and breakwater respectively the array of force balances is displayed in fig 4 close up images of the test models are depicted in fig 5 3 2 validation to determine the porous parameter g for the test models the values of inertia coefficient s and porous resistance coefficient f need to be evaluated previous studies li et al 2006 yu 1995 suggests s 1 for most practical problems further case studies have found that the results derived from s 1 and s 0 have little difference because the phase differences of the forces between the foundation and breakwater are not considered in this part s 0 is adopted which can ensure σ is a real parameter the value of f is approximately evaluated by the empirical formulae of li et al 2006 41 f 3338 7 δ h 2 82 769 δ h 8 711 then the value of g for a given perforated breakwater can be obtained from eq 7 with known porous resistance coefficient f and inertial coefficient s the wave loads on a single circular foundation and a single quasi ellipsoid foundation are predicted by empirical formulae with σ 1000 the comparison of the experimental analytical and empirical formulae results for a single circular foundation is shown in fig 6 a and b these subfigures exhibit that the empirical formulae can successfully represent the analytical results and both of them are adequate to predict the experimental results for the results of the cs l the predictions are good by both analytical method and empirical formulae as displayed in fig 6 c f in the frame of potential theory when the foundation is symmetric about the axis in the wave propagating direction the wave forces on the structures in transverse direction are zero however some unexpected factors can still cause asymmetric fluctuations because the transverse wave loads on the foundation or breakwater are generally small 10 of the wave loads in the propagation direction are utilized to predict the transverse forces because the wave steepness used here is generally low the linear wave theory is adequate to analyze the wave interaction with a perforated cylindrical system furthermore the empirical formulae based on the analytical method are reasonable because the empirical formulae are built conservatively f 2 x and m 2 y predicted by the empirical formulae in fig 6 e and f are better than that of analytical results with the comparison of experimental results when k r 0 is small in previous study of liu et al 2018 the experimental results show that the wave force on the breakwater will increase with the increasing wave steepness however the predicted results by empirical formulae are independent of the wave steepness to adjust the predicted results for the cases with larger wave steepness a larger value of f is suggested because the conclusion is same as that of cs l only part of wave load results for single quasi ellipsoid foundation and qes l are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 these figures illustrate that the empirical formulae can efficiently predict the wave loads on the foundation and breakwater with the variation in the geometry parameter and wave exposures the purpose for constructing the outer breakwater is to reduce the wave loads on the inner foundation the effective range of the breakwater can be evaluated by f 1 f s i n n e r where f s i n n e r is the wave force on the single foundation without a breakwater in practical applications the two structures are frequently connected as a unit however the phase difference of wave forces between the foundation and breakwater with a quasi ellipsoid section is highly affected by the wave parameters and geometric parameters for most cases the wave forces on the two structures are not synchronous and the total wave force can be conservatively obtained by f 1 2 f 2 2 for all the cases then the effective range can be evaluated by the cases of f 1 2 f 2 2 f s i n n e r as to cs there are more interesting rules for the phase difference of wave forces therefore it is worth to give a further investigate on the wave loads of cs 4 further investigation of cs 4 1 wave forces on cs fig 9 shows the time histories of the wave forces on the foundation and breakwater in the x direction for different model tests as a comparison the wave forces on a single circular foundation are also presented synchronously with the results of cs l and cs s for the cases of t 0 6 s and t 0 7 s the existence of breakwater significantly reduces the wave forces on inner foundation particularly at the trough of the wave forces as presented in fig 9 a and b for these two cases the decreasing porosity leads a decrease in the wave forces on the inner foundation and an increase in the wave forces on the outer breakwater for the cases of t 0 8 s and t 1 0 s the wave forces on the inner foundation are larger than the results of single circular foundation as depicted in fig 9 c and d the comparison results illustrate that the breakwater can increase the wave loads on the inner structures in specific wave cases it is important to note that an improper design of the breakwater could enlarge the wave forces on inner structures and a higher porosity of the breakwater could further deteriorate the results for the cases of t 1 2 s t 1 5 s and t 2 0 s the wave forces on inner foundation and single circular foundation are almost coincident as shown in fig 9 e f and g the effect of outer breakwater on inner foundation can be neglected however the wave force variation of breakwater versus the wave period is significant the wave forces on the outer breakwater are close to zero at t 1 2 s with a further increase in the wave period the wave forces on the outer breakwater increase significantly fig 9 also illustrates that the wave forces on breakwater are advance compared with the force curves of inner foundation when t 0 6 s t 0 7 s t 0 8 s and t 1 0 s on the contrary they are hysteresis when t 1 5 s and t 2 0 s fig 10 shows the phase difference δ ϕ between the force curves of the outer breakwater and inner foundation where the force curves of inner foundation are taken as the reference in this figure the analytical results of δ ϕ for the concerned model are displayed together the analytical results are obtained in the framework of the potential theory in fig 10 the analytical results of δ ϕ consist of two horizontal lines in the region of 0 k r 0 4 and they are independent of the value of k r 0 except a phase jump around k r 0 0 86 the difference in the two horizontal lines is π the phase jump appears when the value of the wave force on outer breakwater is minimum analytical investigation finds that the values of δ ϕ are independent of the parameters of ε and δ they are only determined by the ratio of s and f because s does not have an explicit formula for the present models two values of s f 0 and 0 56 are selected as examples when s f 0 the results of δ ϕ corresponding to the low and high horizontal lines are equal to π 2 and π 2 respectively with increasing s f both the horizontal lines will increase synchronously and equally their difference will always remain π another important characteristic of the phase jump point is that k r 0 corresponding to it is independent of the porous parameter g the dominant parameters of it are k r 0 and d the detailed analysis of this characteristic is presented in section 4 2 in fig 10 the comparison of experimental results and analytical results shows that analytical results will underestimate the value of δ ϕ when s f 0 generally s f 0 56 can provide more acceptable results the experimental results demonstrate the existence of the phase jump phenomenon however the variation of δ ϕ is not as sharp as the results predicted by the analytical method it should be noticed that there also exists the phenomenon of phase jump in the cases of qes l the difference is that the values of δ ϕ is no longer constant and is highly affected by k r 0 fig 11 shows the wave force amplitudes on inner foundation and outer breakwater which have been divided by the force amplitude of single foundation the amplitude from the experimental results is set as half of the difference between the crest and trough of the wave forces in fig 11 a the wave forces on the inner foundation are less sensitive to the breakwater when k r 0 is small which has been described in fig 9 it is important to note that the wave protection of breakwater on inner foundation with a low k r 0 is invalid when t 0 8 s the wave force ratio could be even much larger than 1 the purpose of reducing the wave force on inner foundation can only be achieved when k r 0 is large concurrently a low porosity can further benefit the reduction in the wave force on inner foundation fig 11 b shows that a low porosity can significantly increase the wave force on outer breakwater to provide a clear illustration of when the breakwaters are effective fig 12 presents the force ratios for different d r 0 obtained by mathematical model apparently the force ratio results depend on the values of f and s as an example f 8 9744 and s 0 are adopted for the following analysis in fig 12 a the curves lower than 1 are the effective regions for the protection of breakwater it shows that increasing d r 0 can lead to a larger effective region and a smaller force ratio another characteristic is that the force ratios reach 1 when the wave loads on breakwater become minimum where the phase jump occurs in some cases the breakwater is connected with the foundation as a unit hence it is relevant to study the total wave forces on the two structures as shown in fig 12 b the force ratio results shown here have a similar tendency to that of the force ratio of inner foundation but they are limited in the range of 0 75 1 00 for the present cases with a small k r 0 the force ratio could be slightly larger than 1 as d r 0 1 00 in summary the breakwater is only effective in cases of large k r 0 the wave loads on the inner foundation can be reduced significantly by increasing d r 0 the design of a breakwater should be conducted away from the phase jump points fig 13 exhibits the power spectral density psd results when t 0 7 s at different wave steepness levels by comparing the psd results of cs l and cs s it is easy to find that the component of second order wave forces on inner foundations increases with increasing wave steepness at the same wave steepness level the second order wave force on inner foundation of cs s is larger than that of cs l indicating that decreasing porosity can enhance the high order wave actions on the inner foundation for both cs l and cs s the second order wave forces on outer breakwater are not significant this conclusion is supported by the historical curves of wave force shown in fig 9 which illustrates that the wave forces on breakwater are much smoother than those on inner foundation 4 2 phase jump points for cs a schematic of the wave loads on the breakwater versus k r 0 is shown in fig 14 where q i i 1 2 represents the minimum points and δ i i 1 2 represents the intervals between two adjacent points the analytical results have proven that the phase jump occurs when the breakwater reaches its minimum points and the jump value at this point is always equals to π in theory in section 2 3 a rough prediction formula for q 1 is already given in eqs 32 and 38 in this subsection more accurate formulae of q 1 and δ i are provided for cs the analytical expression of the wave force on the breakwater is given by wang and ren 1994 42 f 2 abs π s 1 γ π k r 0 2 h 1 γ k r 0 s 1 i 2 g k r 0 h 1 k r 0 43 s 1 j 1 k r 0 y 1 γ k r 0 j 1 γ k r 0 y 1 k r 0 where j 1 and y 1 are first order derivations of j 1 and y 1 which are the bessel functions of the first type and second type respectively h 1 is the hankel function having a relationship of h 1 j 1 i y 1 and parameter γ 1 d r 0 eq 42 indicates that the minimum points occur only if s 1 0 at these points the wave forces on breakwater are zero different from cs the results of qes show that the wave forces at these minimum points do not have such a rule in most cases the wave forces on the breakwater at the minimum points are slightly larger than zero go back to cs a new function is defined as 44 γ κ y 1 κ j 1 κ in eq 44 it is assumed that j 1 κ 0 for the case of j 1 κ 0 one can use 1 γ κ instead of γ κ for the same analysis fig 15 shows the variation of γ κ versus κ in this figure the asymptotic lines correspond to the value of κ as j 1 κ 0 infinite domains are divided by these asymptotic lines and only four of them are shown in this figure in domain i γ κ decreases with increasing κ until it reaches a trough at the trough the value of κ can be proven to be 1 for the other domains γ κ increases monotonically with increasing κ the values of k r 0 corresponding to q i are the solutions of 45 γ k r 0 γ γ k r 0 from fig 15 the solution of q 1 can be found in domain i with k r 0 1 and γ k r 0 1 in this domain both k r 0 and γ k r 0 converge to the trough point as γ 1 the figure also illustrates that the value of k r 0 corresponding to q 1 is always less than 1 for the solutions of q i i 2 k r 0 and γ k r 0 are located in two different adjacent domains an important characteristic of γ κ is that γ κ tan κ π 4 as κ this implies that γ κ will become a period function as κ is sufficiently large and q i i will also appear periodically therefore for a certain γ δ i will converge to a constant as i because of the complexity of bessel functions explicit formulae of q 1 and δ i from eq 45 are unavailable therefore the fitting approach is still the best method for building the empirical formulae of q 1 and δ i by solving the mathematic model the wave loads on the foundation and breakwaters for different d r are obtained then k r 0 corresponding to q i are selected and the empirical formulae of q 1 and δ i are generated it should be noticed that q 1 and δ i are determined with wave loads in the forms of eqs 12 and 13 concurrently further investigation reveals that their values are only determined by the geometry parameter and are not affected by the water depth and porous parameter g generalizing from the analytical results the value of k r 0 for q 1 can be formulated as 46 q 1 k r 0 2 089 2 089 d r 0 the formulae of δ i i 1 2 3 are given by 47 δ 1 k r 0 2 652 d r 0 1 07 48 δ 2 k r 0 3 036 d r 0 1 042 49 δ 3 k r 0 3 107 d r 0 1 018 the effective range of d r 0 for eq 46 49 is 0 4 in fig 16 the fitting results of eq 46 can successfully predict the variation in q 1 with increasing d r 0 it shows that the results of k r 0 reach 1 as d r 0 0 the reason for this is already presented above eqs 32 and 38 can also provide acceptable results in their effective range out of this range they are no longer accurate and will cause a large error with a large d r 0 fig 17 shows the analytical results and fitting results of δ i versus d r 0 it illustrates that δ i will sharply increase to an infinite value as d r 0 decreases to 0 it also points out that δ 1 has the smallest value compared to δ i i 2 for the same d r 0 for the interval δ i i 3 and 4 their values are very close since δ i for a certain d r 0 will converge to a constant when i is sufficiently large the formula of δ 3 is applicable for δ i i 4 5 conclusion in this study empirical formulae for the wave loads on the foundation and breakwater with a quasi ellipsoid section are provided the variation curves of the wave loads versus different wave numbers are simplified as polygonal lines which are characterized by four key points benefiting from this the wave loads can be rapidly obtained from the interpolated values between two key points avoiding calculating the bessel functions the geometry parameters porous parameters wave numbers and wave exposures are considered in the empirical formulae within their effective range to validate the empirical formulae and provide a further understating of the wave loads model tests are conducted on quasi ellipsoid type foundation with the protection of cylindrical breakwaters the main findings of this study are 1 model tests in the wave flume on cylindrical systems with two types of sections circular section and quasi ellipsoid section confirm that the empirical formulae can successfully predict the wave loads on the quasi ellipsoid type cylindrical system the wave loads on a single quasi ellipsoid foundation can also be evaluated by the empirical formulae using a large σ 2 wave load protection of the breakwater on inner foundation is only effective in the large k r 0 region in the small k r 0 region the wave loads on inner foundation almost equal to those on the single foundation and the existence of the breakwater has less effect on the foundation in the large k r 0 region the decreasing porosity of the breakwater can efficiently reduce the wave loads on inner foundation 3 the phase jump occurs at the points where the wave loads on the breakwater are minimum these minimum points are mainly controlled by the geometric parameters of the structure for a circular system the distribution of these minimum points is approximately uniformly spaced after the third minimum point the design of a cylindrical breakwater is expected to avoid the phase jump points credit authorship contribution statement jiabin liu conceptualization methodology
