4465,despite the long lasting and widespread drought in the sahel flood events did punctuate in the past the concern about floods remains dwarf on the international research and policy agenda compared to droughts in this paper we elucidate that floods in the sahel are now becoming more frequent widespread and more devastating we analyzed gridded daily rainfall data over the period 1981 2020 used photographs and satellite images to depict flood areas and threats compiled and studied flood related statistics over the past two decades and supported the results with peer reviewed literature our analysis revealed that the timing of the maximum daily rainfall occurs from the last week of july to mid august in the eastern sahel but from the last week of july to the end of august in the western sahel in 2019 and 2020 flash and riverine floods took their toll in sudan and elsewhere in the region in terms of the number of affected people direct deaths destroyed and damaged houses and croplands contaminated water resources and disease outbreaks and deaths changes in rainfall intensity human interventions in the physical environment and poor urban planning play a major role in driving catastrophic floods emphasis should be put on understanding flood causes and impacts on vulnerable societies controlling water borne diseases and recognizing the importance of compiling relevant and reliable flood information extreme rainfall in this dry region could be an asset for attenuating the regional water scarcity status if well harvested and managed we hope this paper will induce the hydroclimate scholars to carry out more flood studies for the sahel it is only then encumbered meaningful opportunities for flood risk management can start to unveil keywords flash flood riverine flood flood impact flood forecasting adaptation extremes sahel 1 introduction the climate of the sahel region which expands from west to east africa fig 1 is renowned for variability and related phenomenal stressors epule et al 2018 coping with climate variability and change in the sahel as in other parts of africa is beset by challenges such as limited expertise preparedness and resources needed to handle climate issues walsh et al 1994 washington et al 2006 although droughts and floods are two phenomena of the same water cycle research customarily focuses on either of the two extremes due to their complexity and differences in temporal and spatial scales ward et al 2020 the sahel drought has attracted increasing interest amongst scholars and policymakers worldwide since its onset in the early 1970s tanaka et al 1975 kerr 1985 hulme 2001 nicholson et al 2018 while scientists from africa are urging the united nations to support preparations for imminent droughts in view of exacerbating climate change nature editorial ne 2019 padma 2019 floods in the sahel went far unacknowledged in africa disasters connected with floods are the most frequent and the costliest while those related to droughts account for the largest number of fatalities wmo 2020 until 2018 research on the flood phenomena in the sahel was 44 less than that of drought stressors epule et al 2018 this attitude has consequently compounded the human and environmental vulnerability to floods tarhule 2005 stated that historical flood records lack comprehensiveness standardization quality control and scientific rigor a plethora of studies has investigated the changing and variable rainfall observed over the sahel rainfall characteristics are changing in the sahel at large from east to west daily rainfall data from both ground observations and satellites indicate an increase in the frequency of extreme events the intensity of rain and the inter annual variability sulieman and elagib 2012 ly et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 these results reveal an increasing intensity and occurrence probability of extreme rainfall rather than a rainfall recovery roughly since the beginning of the 21st century with the intensification being stronger in the eastern sahel than the western sahel panthou et al 2018 rivers in the sahel have demonstrated changes in their flows analyses of discharge data of the senegal and niger rivers indicate an intensification of the hydrological signal in the western sahel modification of the hydrological regimes in these rivers is demonstrated by an increase in the annual maxima wilcox et al 2018 and a twin peak hydrograph descroix et al 2012 in 2010 2012 and 2013 the niger river recorded the highest discharge peaks ever since the 1920s casse and gosset 2015 the flows of the nile river in the eastern sahel show successive above average anomalies during the 21st century taye and willems 2012 basheer and elagib 2019 basheer et al 2021 elagib et al 2021a investigations into the occurrence of heavy rainfall and rain induced floods and their causes in the sahel region are necessary because of the devastation these events bring to people and properties e g loss of lives and destruction of houses and infrastructures as well as to the environment and socioeconomic systems tarhule 2005 floods also cause interruption to primary health care facilities and services abbas and routray 2013 therefore we investigate the flood risk in the african sahel region in light of recent rainfall and river flow tendencies outlooks for skillful flood forecasts and adaptation are remarked a viewpoint is established in a hope for guiding individual societal and regional activities 2 study area the sahel is around 3 1 million km2 body of land spanning 5 900 km across an arid and semi arid belt of africa from east to west between the saharan desert the rainforests of central africa and the guinean coast fig 1 the region stretches from senegal and gambia on the atlantic coast through mali mauritania burkina faso nigeria niger chad and sudan to the northwestern part of ethiopia and eritrea on the red sea coast a total of 407 4 million people were estimated to live in the 11 sahel countries as of 2014 table 1 this population is projected to reach 597 9 million by 2030 grassland shrubs and small thorny trees are the main land covers in the region the importance of the region originates from its abundant human cultural and natural resources however risks of climate change poor soil growing population and increasing pressure on the natural resources challenge the sustainable development poverty reduction and environmental restoration of the sahel region mohamed 2011 sissoko et al 2011 elagib et al 2021b despite its concomitant vulnerability to the impacts of climatic variability and land degradation subsistence agricultural activities constitute the dominant contributor to the sahel economy food security and livelihoods 3 materials and methods 3 1 flood related statistics this study used secondary data on the number of affected people direct deaths and destroyed and damaged houses and disease outbreaks and deaths related to flood events unless otherwise indicated these data were compiled from reports of the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha reliefweb and floodlist depending on the availability of country level data these sources provide annual situation reports including statistics on the above stated attributes for this study a follow up of the reporting updates was ensured to obtain the latest statistics for sudan these data were extracted from ocha situation reports for the period 1998 2020 examining these data enables diagnosing the flood phenomena in terms of the exposure to danger harm or loss i e risk 3 2 spatio temporal maximum daily rainfall in this research the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps version 2 0 rainfall product was selected for assessing extreme events over sudan and the sahel the chirps dataset is developed and maintained by the u s geological survey usgs and the climate hazards group of the university of california funk et al 2015 and was selected for two reasons first it has a long daily time series 1981 to date with a spatial resolution of around 5 km second validation results ranked the performance of chirps highest using multiple rainfall indices across east and sub saharan africa dinku et al 2018 harrison et al 2019 the maximum rainfall value for each pixel was calculated and visualized for the sahel countries and for the eastern and western sahel over the period from 1981 to 2019 3 3 flood inundation photographs and mapping photographs were requested by the authors through personal communications with freelance press photographers photography hobbyists and colleagues in order to document flood incidents and threats additionally landsat 8 satellite images were retrieved from the united states geological survey usgs data center to detect flood areas as explained below cloud cover was a limiting factor in processing the images and identifying flood areas a floodwater detection method al zayed and elagib 2017 was used to identify flood areas in 2019 and 2020 the method utilizes the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the evaporative fraction ef to detect water pixels it is known that water pixels have negative ndvi values pettorelli et al 2005 ma et al 2007 and have high ef values of 0 75 1 0 al zayed et al 2016 both the ndvi and ef were calculated using landsat 8 satellite images with a 30 m spatial resolution the ndvi was derived from the reflectivity corrected red band 4 and near infrared band 5 bands using the equation band 5 band 4 band 5 band 4 as described by vermote et al 2016 ef was derived by retrieving the land surface temperature lst from the thermal band band 10 after radiance conversion based on the methodology of usgs 2019 as follows ef lsth lstx lsth lstc where lsth is the average of three hot pixels taken from the land lstc is the average of three cold water pixels and lstx is the lst pixel value for the satellite image for the 2019 flood event a total of 146 satellite images covering sudan paths 171 179 rows 45 52 were processed for the periods before and after the rainy event of 9 10 august 2019 that caused widespread flooding nine images were selected and analyzed to capture flash floodwater considering the cloud cover and spatial representation of the sudanese states for the 2020 flood event fifteen satellite images with minimal cloud cover were selected and processed to capture the flood along some reaches of the nile river 3 4 river water levels daily river water level data were obtained for the khartoum river gage located on the nile in khartoum city sudan s capital these data cover the 1954 2020 period each year in this period was classified into normal alert critical or flooding based on the maximum daily river water level and the riverine flood alarm thresholds used for khartoum gage by the ministry of irrigation and water resources of sudan this analysis enabled understanding the change in the severity occurrence and frequency of nile riverine floods 3 5 probability and return period of maximum rainfall time series of the maximum daily rainfall occurring in a year as obtained from chirps were employed to construct a mathematical relationship that estimates the rainfall with a given probability of exceedance and a return period two approaches as described by mansell 2003 were compared the first approach involves ranking the data in descending order and using weibull s formula given by eqs 1 and 2 bellow 1 p m n 1 2 t 1 p where p is the probability of exceedance m is the rank n is the data size and t is the return period in years the maximum rainfall return period relationship was plotted in a normal log form in the second approach the gumbel distribution form was used as follows gumbel distribution relies on two parameters namely the mean μ and the standard deviation σ of the data under analysis the maximum rainfall for a given return period can be obtained based on the cumulative distribution 3 r μ 6 π σ y 0 5772 6 π σ where y is the reduced variate and is given as 4 y l n ln 1 1 t the probability of a rainfall r exceeding a given rainfall r is calculated based on the following equation 5 p r r 1 e x p e x p y where y can be obtained by rearranging eq 3 to give 6 y r 0 5772 6 π σ μ 6 π σ then the return period of a magnitude of rainfall is obtained using eq 2 3 6 meteorological causes of the most recent disastrous floods to enrich the discussion on the major meteorological factors influencing the flood events the causes of the 2019 and 2020 floods in sudan were linked to the atmospheric moisture budget the monthly total columnar water vapor tcwv the tropospheric moisture flux and the flux divergence were obtained from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf product era5 hersbach et al 2020 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 the anomalies for the 2019 and 2020 wet seasons of the above mentioned variables were calculated with respect to the 1981 2010 mean 3 7 literature review secondary data in the form of published scientific literature were used to identify the documented flood events during the recent past support the present analysis of flood frequency ascribe the flood incidents and impacts and explore the existing and potential attempts to flood forecasting in the region this literature is cited in the relevant sections and appropriately detailed in the reference list 4 results 4 1 flood occurrence distribution and magnitude during the period 1981 2019 the chirps data show a highest rainfall recorded in one day across the sahel region of 216 9 mm fig 2 a out of the 39 year data record 21 maxima occurred in the eastern sahel while 18 maxima were recorded in the western sahel fig 2b the chirps data plotted in fig 2b show that the maximum rainfall in the eastern sahel excluding eritrea often occurs during the last week of july to mid august in eritrea the maximum occurs during mid march to mid april the western sahel experiences the maximum rainfall in the period from the last week of july to the end of august following the peak sahel drought in the 1980s the literature has reported flood occurrences across the region in 1995 1998 1999 2002 2003 2005 2006 2007 2008 2012 2013 2014 and 2017 williams and nottage 2006 tschakert et al 2010 paeth et al 2011 samimi et al 2012 boyd et al 2013 mahmood et al 2017 adegoke et al 2019 the spatial distribution of the maximum daily rainfall recorded for these years is depicted in fig 2c sahel wide this maximum occurs mostly in the far west the south central part eastern sudan or the far east the highest daily rainfall recorded during 1981 2019 is displayed in fig 2d during the first fortnight of august 2019 a heavy rainstorm developed over a large part of sudan top left corner in fig 3 unlike the locally unprecedented 200 mm storm of 1988 in khartoum hulme and trilsbach 1989 the extent of wet conditions leading to flooding on the 9th and 10th of august 2019 across sudan was exceptionally vast fig 3 many parts of the country received a high proportion of their august rain in this storm based on the weibull probability formula the frequency curves of maximum daily rainfall are shown in fig 4 the results are given for the eastern western and entire sahel region in addition to four selected sahelian countries which have been frequently reported to encounter flood events the results in fig 4 are compared with those obtained using the gumbel distribution function see table 2 the table shows approximately similar results concerning the maximum rainfall at short return periods at long return periods the difference in rainfall estimates between the two approaches diverges as for riverine flood events the nile river in the eastern part of the sahel is a striking case to perceive for instance the 67 year long time series of the maximum water levels of the blue nile recorded at the capital of sudan fig 5 manifests 27 40 3 occurrences of flood alarms 18 26 9 critical cases and 19 28 4 alert events against only 3 4 5 normal years the 21st century has so far been unequivocal in its increasing nile flows during the last decade alone khartoum witnessed 8 flood alarms with increasing severity comparing fig 5 with fig 2c the synchronous occurrence of extreme rainfall in the eastern sahel and nile water levels representing alert critical and flooding events is evident in 2020 the nile water level at khartoum reached an unprecedented level 380 65 m asl which exceeded the peak levels reached in 1946 380 1 m asl and in 1988 379 94 m asl as reported by davies and walsh 1997 subsequent to rainfall in the source region of the nile particularly the ethiopian highlands an exceptionally widespread fluvial flooding developed in sudan during august and september the water levels of all dam reservoirs in sudan increased and some of the nile river tributaries overflowed fig 6 4 2 flood impacts in the eastern sahel particularly sudan not only were the years 2019 and 2020 characteristic of flood impacts but they were also part of a state of more than two decades of spatio temporal losses of property and lives fig 7 for instance unusually early rainy season with heavy and persistent rain in 1999 caused severe and widespread floods in central sudan williams and nottage 2006 affecting 1 841 180 people destroying 30 707 houses and damaging 64 350 houses fig 7 compared to the 1988 flood hulme and trilsbach 1989 sutcliffe et al 1989 the severity of the 2019 flood event in sudan did not prompt immediate and substantial world attention to catalyze relief actions a few television networks broadcasted scenes of mass havoc in the aftermath the government of sudan was challenged by an economic recession and environmental and health disasters to place the 2019 flooding in sudan in the sahelian context we compare its impacts with the well documented 2007 flood event of the sahel in 2007 the west sahelian floods affected 429 376 people displaced 84059 and killed 153 boyd et al 2013 as of 21 november 2019 the 2019 flood affected 426 300 people led to the death of 78 people damaged 35 725 houses and destroyed 49 535 houses in sudan alone the year 2019 s flooding in sudan disconnected 123 villages in the white nile state from access by relief campaigns assayha 2019 in niger in the western sahel heavy rains and flooding of the niger river in 2019 affected 211 366 people killed 57 people and damaged 16 375 houses in 2020 the sahel flooding resulted in 2 006 000 affected people 181 500 destroyed houses and 417 deaths with 56 4 54 5 and 62 3 of these numbers respectively reported across sudan alone fig 8 from both fluvial or pluvial floods heavy rains and river flooding across chad including the capital n djamena in 2020 caused ravages thus affecting 64 670 households or 388 000 people displacing hundreds of thousands of people destroying hundreds of thousands of hectares of cultivated land washing away thousands of cattle and inundating storekeepers stocks in markets based on figs 3 and 7 one can infer that the most disrupted areas in terms of the number of affected people in sudan are occasionally located adjacent to river streams e g northern gezira white nile khartoum kassala and sennar states densely populated urban centers the capital khartoum state and engulfed by huge wadis e g north kurdofan state in 2020 pluvial floods affected north darfur state the most whereas the most affected states as a result of rivers that overflowed their banks were khartoum blue nile sennar and gezira states figs 6 and 8a flash and riverine flood damages pose major threats in the sahel region exemplary of these threats are best depicted in figs 9 and 10 for the 2019 and 2020 flood disasters in sudan respectively the nile floodwater inundated a large number of farmlands fig 10a c the 2020 flash and riverine floods damaged approximately 2 2 million hectares of croplands in sudan and consequently put vulnerable households at risk of food insecurity an additional salient feature is the health impacts due to the widespread presence of stagnant floodwaters during the flood seasons of 2019 and 2020 mosquitos found breeding grounds in 2019 a cholera outbreak in sudan started in september following the august flash floods the first cases were reported in the states adjacent to south sudan likely related to a large number of refugees without access to clean drinking water or sanitation who mostly rely on open defecation the cholera outbreak rapidly spread to more than eight states in sudan due to the movement of people due to the quick response of the sudanese government in announcing the cholera outbreak calling for local and international organizations to provide health and food assistance the cholera cases were limited malaria in sudan breached the epidemic threshold in 2019 as over 1 8 million cases were reported the collapse of pit latrines fig 9a totaling more than 5000 in 2019 and 16 000 in 2020 and the mixture of their contents with floodwater represented breeding grounds for several water borne diseases such as cholera water resources were extensively damaged in 13 states due to contamination floodwater mixed with solid waste in residential areas was noticed during the flood of september 2020 many collection points of solid waste inside flood zones were inundated and waste of different types mixed with floodwater and represented a source of water pollution fig 10f reported disease outbreaks and casualties across sudan during the period from 9 august 2019 to 8 january 2020 were 97 cases of diphtheria including 13 deaths 4225 dengue fever cases including 13 deaths 572 rift valley fever cases 11 deaths 296 chikungunya cases including 5 deaths and 346 cholera cases 11 deaths in september 2020 120 cases of fever attributed to floods including 8 deaths were reported in the northern state in sudan by the federal ministry of health 2020a as a result of lessons learned from the 2019 flood disaster the sudanese government fought to avoid another cholera outbreak in 2020 by preparing emergency response plans for the whole country fedral ministry of health 2020b in 2020 a special focus was devoted to the most affected states in the country khartoum sennar and northern states 5 discussion albeit in varying magnitude and place of occurrence the above findings and data are striking in the sense that floods in the sahel have become recurrent and their impacts have become more devastating in the eastern sahel particularly sudan pluvial and fluvial flood occurrences are not unique in the history of record of the last two centuries hulme and trilsbach 1989 sutcliffe et al 1989 walsh et al 1994 this section traces the possible causal factors associated with the past flood events in the region the opportunities for and the challenges to skillful seasonal rainfall or flood forecasts a hopeful discussion on how to move forward toward flood risk management is also provided 5 1 causes of floods the rainfall results reported above identify extreme rainfall consecutive daily rainfall events and high river water levels as hydroclimatic causes of floods it is to be noted that the rise in the streamflow of the nile i e from the blue nile and white nile subsequent to cumulative rainfall amounts in these regions was the main hydroclimatic reason for the riverine flood in sudan in 2020 fig 6 such concurrent nile and flash floods are not unusual in the history of records a similar case was reported in the 1988 flood year sutcliffe et al 1989 walsh et al 1994 davies and walsh 1997 one could back the impact statistics in fig 7 with the recurrence analysis of maximum daily rainfall given in table 2 the table indicates a maximum daily rainfall of 117 0 mm based on the weibull formula or 120 7 mm based on gumbel distribution can occur in sudan at least once in 2 years such an amount of daily rain is extreme for a region with arid and semi arid climate conditions that receives a median annual rainfall of 87 2 to 658 4 mm elagib 2009 a cautionary note should be made here that the absolutes of return values might have been underestimated due to the use of chirps kpanou et al 2021 presented proof that chrips has lower 95th percentiles than rain gauge values due to its algorithm the influence of sea surface temperatures on the sahel interannual rainfall variability i e the observed characteristics of wet and dry years in the sahel are explained by previous studies nicholson and webster 2007 hagos and cook 2008 there remains however a question of whether the observed increase in rainfall intensity is influenced by large scale changes in the atmospheric circulation or more local factors enhancing the convection intensity or both panthou et al 2014 cook 2008 argues that the future may hold additional important influences multi decadal satellite observations from the western sahel reveal rapid intensification of mesoscale convective systems which are suggested to be strongly related to the global land temperature but weakly related to the recovery of annual rainfall taylor et al 2017 the influence of anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing is also suggested to have played a role in the recent as well as the sustenance of recovery in the sahel rainfall haarsma et al 2005 dong and sutton 2015 ficchì and stephens 2019 found an influence of the patterns of variability of the indian ocean dipole iod and el niño southern oscillation enso on the timing of the start of the rainy season that translates into changes in river flood timing in sub saharan africa particularly east africa the wetter than normal rainy season in 2017 over west africa including the western sahel was linked to the propagation of more intense larger and colder mesoscale convective systems across the region adegoke et al 2019 mekonen 2020 attributed the above average rainfall in the sahel in 2019 with its largest positive anomalies in chad and sudan and drier conditions along the guinea and western coastal regions to persistently below average sea surface temperatures off the coast of west africa later in the year 2019 a record breaking iod led to extreme wet conditions in the headwaters of the white nile wainwright et al 2020 the extreme rains in the blue nile catchment in june september 2020 could be partly attributed to a developing weak la niña conditions la niña is known to enhance the rains during the ethiopian kiremt rainy season june september fig 11 a d show the mean and anomalous atmospheric water vapor flux vectors for august 2020 for sudan and its surroundings fig 11b reveals anomalous and convergent westerly moisture flux in the belt 10 14 n where the climatological moisture flux is easterly fig 11a a cyclonic flow in central west sudan which can be interpreted as a vertically deeper and northward displacement of westerly monsoon flow is evident fig 11d exhibits anomalously high total columnar water vapor content tcwv values that prevailed in the entire region in august 2020 with strong anomalies in the order of 15 20 in the area of the strongest climatological zonal moisture gradient between 14 and 18 n fig 11c it is worth mentioning that the entire sahel experienced positive rainfall anomalies during the 2020 west african monsoon season of which august was the peak month unlike in the first half of the 20th century wetter kiremt rains over the ethiopian highlands in the more recent period 1969 1999 were related to anomalous westerly flow across the sahel bahaga et al 2019 their fig s3 moreover a significant positive correlation with the atlantic meridional oscillation amo emerged the 2020 sahel and kiremt rains align with this recent multidecadal trend since the amo was positive with the largest amplitude in august 2020 https psl noaa gov data correlation amon us data while anomalies of moisture flux weakened in september not shown in fig 11 the troposphere remained anomalously moist over the region likely facilitating the development of convective rainstorms the observations reported above with respect to the most recurrently flood disrupted areas in sudan figs 3 6 9 and 10 concur with reports in the literature of the sahel at large an increase in the number of flood events per year has been recently reported with urban areas suffering catastrophic consequences mahmood et al 2017 de risi et al 2018 adegoke et al 2019 tazen et al 2019 many flood events and impacts are traced back to proximity to or settlement in flood prone areas e g rivers flood plains wadis and low lying areas clay silt soil that is compacted or of low infiltration capacity inadequate drainage systems lack of adaptation experience poor quality of housing changes in land use bad governance weak institutional capacity and or poor urban planning hulme and trilsbach 1989 walsh et al 1994 tarhule 2005 mahmoud et al 2014 2017 de risi et al 2018 horn and elagib 2018 adegoke et al 2019 tazen et al 2019 in the eastern nile the changes in land use cover and degradation of the upper blue nile basin in ethiopia increased high flows and decreased low flows bewket and sterk 2005 woldesenbet et al 2017 5 2 potential for climate and flood projection forecasting and modeling climate projections of the mean changes in sahel rainfall for the 21st century remain uncertain even under the latest coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 model experiments although the ensemble mean rainfall shows a robust increase in the central and eastern parts monerie et al 2020 projections indicate a likelihood of an increase in rainfall intensity over most of the sahel rather than lengthening of the wet season vizy et al 2013 under climate change climate model simulations further suggest an increase in the total annual and the year to year variability of the nile flow in the 21st century siam and eltahir 2017 according to recent modeling scenarios extreme precipitation events e g extremely and consecutive wet days are expected to increase in the future in the central and eastern sahel in contrast to west africa diedhiou et al 2018 aziz et al 2019 tegegne et al 2020 the likely intensification of extreme and heavy precipitation events in ethiopia tegegne et al 2020 implies amplification of the probability of intense runoff and flood risks in the eastern sahel however almost all studies are thus far based on global or regional climate models that do not explicitly resolve the rain bearing convective systems over africa e g salih et al 2018 here simulating future storms at convection permitting resolution holds large promises in providing more confidence in predicting future extreme rainfall events as shown recently by kendon et al 2019 and finney et al 2020 cumulative rainfall during consecutive rainy days appears to drive flooding in parts of the sahel region for example in niger taylor et al 2017 in east africa the influence of positive and negative phases of both iod and enso can cause a difference in timing of the river flood of more than three months ficchì and stephens 2019 thus skillful iod and enso seasonal predictions have a high potential for useful flood predictions we notice from the literature for the eastern part of the sahel e g khartoum that floods took place repeatedly during the first fortnight of august i e the peak of the rainy season hulme and trilsbach 1989 williams and nottage 2006 mahmood et al 2017 following the drought era the western sahel zone appears to be confronting severe flood events almost throughout the first three weeks of august tarhule 2005 paeth et al 2011 samimi et al 2012 this information could guide forecasters prediction experts to improve the skillfulness of models during these periods of the season to improve the preparedness for flood management patt et al 2007 concluded that developing user specific forecasts and interactive communication is key to the success of the programs intended to utilize climate forecasting in africa in climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction the following part of this section offers an overview of attempts made to date to provide seasonal rainfall or flood forecast and modeling for the sahel region the use of data on sea surface temperature anomalies and enso to issue seasonal rainfall predictions has been in practice by the west african climate outlook forums since 1998 tschakert et al 2010 similarly these predictors have been in use by the igad climate prediction and application centre icpac of the intergovernmental authority on development igad in delivering climate services to eastern africa including the east african sahel countries for sahelian catchments in the west african sahel nka et al 2015 found significant coherence between flood trends and trends in the maximum 5 day consecutive rainfall however they recommended using hydrological models to overcome the limitations inherent in the statistical rainfall runoff relationship analysis which overlooks the spatial and temporal variability in specific hydrological processes amarnath et al 2016 used the hydrologic modeling system hec hms to simulate the rainfall runoff processes to improve flood forecasting in the gash river basin in ethiopia and sudan the hec hms model was supplemented with a land use map digital elevation model dem inputs and the soil conservation service scs curve number cn and scs unit hydrograph uh techniques to transform rainfall into runoff the simulation performed well for river discharge values of lower than 200 m3 s compared to conventional forecasting methods the flood forecast model improved the near real time application by 12 h however amarnath et al 2016 emphasized the imperativeness of augmenting the data inputs to the model such as catchment characteristics e g evapotranspiration and land use change impacts on the water balance in addition to water abstraction in the upstream areas recently fiorillo and tarchiani 2017 proposed a flooding risk evaluation method frem for small medium basins based on a simplified version of the soil water assessment tool swat integrated with remote sensing geographic information systems gis and field surveys adopted at sub basin level in niger they argued that the physically based method is computationally efficient a similar hydrological method was also used to develop catchment response to climate and land use changes in the upper blue nile sub basins in ethiopia woldesenbet et al 2018 the sudan ministry of water resources and irrigation developed a flood forecasting system for the flows of the gash river a transboundary basin shared between ethiopia eritrea and sudan using integrated satellite based rainfall estimates and evapotranspiration gis scs cn and scs uh and hec hms to share information on arriving floods with farmers through smart information and communication technology ict in the gash delta of eastern sudan amarnath et al 2018 the work demonstrated a high potential for enabling the farmers to apply this information and manage their decisions for optimizing farm profits due to scant data babker et al 2020 demonstrated the applicability of the scs cn method coupled with gis land use cover maps dem soil data and freely accessible gridded rainfall estimates for estimating the floodwater in the transboundary baraka river basin in eritrea and sudan the approach proved successful for floodwater harvesting current model based seasonal forecasting of rainfall does not explicitly resolve convection as the spatial resolution is usually too coarse lead time dependent bias corrections are thus mandatory e g lorenz et al 2020 as a reference the latter authors provide bias corrected and spatially disaggregated daily precipitation ensemble forecasts for the blue nile this attempt holds the promise to develop an improved ensemble flood forecast for that catchment 5 3 way forward the ability to attribute causes of changing magnitude and frequency of floods is compounded by several factors including precipitation extremes and characteristics causative mechanisms of storms changes in antecedent hydrologic conditions water storage and management land use changes variations and trends in seasonal sea temperatures etc quantifying these changes provides a crucial information base for optimizing our response and adaptation hirsch and archfield 2015 sharma et al 2018 climate variability over the last three decades should guide the management of rainfall dependent activities and sectors conway 2011 the present analysis should prompt more attention to floods side by side with the prolonged focus on drought events in order to capture the best interventions to manage both climate stressors on the region there exist attempts to offer seasonal rainfall or flood forecast for the sahel region however they remain humble in view of recurring catastrophic floods the results of the present investigation on the timing of occurrence of extreme rainfall in the eastern and western parts of the sahel represent possible forward looking information for flood prediction understanding climate related impacts and opportunities helps make societies resilient to future climate variability and change pielke jr 2005 however to make effective adaptation decisions in the face of uncertain climate predictions the vulnerability of climate dependent decisions and the various means of reducing this vulnerability need to be well understood by the vulnerable societies dessai et al 2009 knowledge about future sahel floods needs to guide relevant adaptation plans by adapting to the inevitable climate change and variability we could substantially reduce the number of those at increased risk of storm flooding parry et al 1998 however the lack of attention to flood risks in the sahel hinders the development of effective flood adaptation plans it is high time now that the effect of mere onlookers within the communities of hydrology and climate sciences and policymaking come into play flood in the sahel is currently viewed as an abnormality this unviable attitude results in perceiving rainfall as a liability rather than a potential asset exactly similar to the attitude used to justify failing to integrate drought characteristics into the planning process hulme 1987 amid the ever synchrony of dry and wet conditions in the region concerns about opportunities for floodwater harvesting should be stimulated to attenuate water scarcity in the region health wise the control measures for cholera are vaccination for short term mitigation and securing clean water supply for the affected regions for long term prevention comprehensive vaccination would reduce future outbreaks because it treats the asymptomatic carriers who would otherwise become a disease source control of mosquito transmitted diseases is more complicated than cholera studies within the sahel proved that this vector could migrate with the wind for distances as far as 300 km to affect other areas huestis et al 2019 hence these diseases could be described as transboundary and must be controlled by inter regional plans in the year 2017 the world health organization who approved theglobal vector control response gvcr which should guide actions to prevent diseases and responses to outbreaks who 2017 the ministry of health of khartoum state in sudan launched an insecticide spraying campaign in cooperation with localities to combat flies and mosquitoes across the state sudan news agency 2020 all plans and actions toward flood risk reduction necessitate reliable information on projected hydroclimate changes taylor et al 2017 demand for information to make decisions is high in the region likewise in many parts of africa conway 2011 updated return periods of river discharges are imperative to ensure protection against floods and better river basin management wilcox et al 2018 relevant and reliable climate information is needed in managing all climate sensitive diseases thomson et al 2011 unfortunately the lack of recognition of the high flood risk and the paucity of data constrain relevant research and mitigation efforts tarhule 2005 6 conclusions the authors herein adopted a primary and secondary data integration method to study the recent sahel pluvial and fluvial flood hazards causes status quo and forward looking plans and actions for reducing the flood risks in the region in light of the present investigation it seems that the region is as liable to suffer from frequent floods as it is prone to multi decadal droughts the consequent massive flood of 2019 and 2020 in the sahel together with a sequence of yearly occurrence of heavy rainfall events during the past two decades provide compelling evidence of an increasing risk of floods in the region addressing both extremes through a holistic risk management approach allows for better identification of relevant tradeoffs and synergies ward et al 2020 changes in natural patterns of climate variability and rainfall intensity human interference in the physical environment soil characteristics and poor urban planning and governance are key influential factors in the increase of flood risk attempts made to date to communicate timely seasonal rainfall or flood forecasts remain humble given that widespread havoc and devastation are becoming commonplace unlike droughts the looming disaster brought about by the recent frequent floods in the sahel is largely omitted worldwide among researchers and policymakers similar to the long lasting sahel drought of the 1970s and 1980s a persistence of the flood risks would not surprise anyone if the recent history is any guide and given the expected climate change scenarios against the backdrop of alternating flood and drought risks to resources e g water land and energy and the environment in the sahel zone overlooking the characteristic flood situation in the hydroclimate of the sahel is no longer viable 7 data availability statement the flood related statistics data that support the findings of this study are

4465,despite the long lasting and widespread drought in the sahel flood events did punctuate in the past the concern about floods remains dwarf on the international research and policy agenda compared to droughts in this paper we elucidate that floods in the sahel are now becoming more frequent widespread and more devastating we analyzed gridded daily rainfall data over the period 1981 2020 used photographs and satellite images to depict flood areas and threats compiled and studied flood related statistics over the past two decades and supported the results with peer reviewed literature our analysis revealed that the timing of the maximum daily rainfall occurs from the last week of july to mid august in the eastern sahel but from the last week of july to the end of august in the western sahel in 2019 and 2020 flash and riverine floods took their toll in sudan and elsewhere in the region in terms of the number of affected people direct deaths destroyed and damaged houses and croplands contaminated water resources and disease outbreaks and deaths changes in rainfall intensity human interventions in the physical environment and poor urban planning play a major role in driving catastrophic floods emphasis should be put on understanding flood causes and impacts on vulnerable societies controlling water borne diseases and recognizing the importance of compiling relevant and reliable flood information extreme rainfall in this dry region could be an asset for attenuating the regional water scarcity status if well harvested and managed we hope this paper will induce the hydroclimate scholars to carry out more flood studies for the sahel it is only then encumbered meaningful opportunities for flood risk management can start to unveil keywords flash flood riverine flood flood impact flood forecasting adaptation extremes sahel 1 introduction the climate of the sahel region which expands from west to east africa fig 1 is renowned for variability and related phenomenal stressors epule et al 2018 coping with climate variability and change in the sahel as in other parts of africa is beset by challenges such as limited expertise preparedness and resources needed to handle climate issues walsh et al 1994 washington et al 2006 although droughts and floods are two phenomena of the same water cycle research customarily focuses on either of the two extremes due to their complexity and differences in temporal and spatial scales ward et al 2020 the sahel drought has attracted increasing interest amongst scholars and policymakers worldwide since its onset in the early 1970s tanaka et al 1975 kerr 1985 hulme 2001 nicholson et al 2018 while scientists from africa are urging the united nations to support preparations for imminent droughts in view of exacerbating climate change nature editorial ne 2019 padma 2019 floods in the sahel went far unacknowledged in africa disasters connected with floods are the most frequent and the costliest while those related to droughts account for the largest number of fatalities wmo 2020 until 2018 research on the flood phenomena in the sahel was 44 less than that of drought stressors epule et al 2018 this attitude has consequently compounded the human and environmental vulnerability to floods tarhule 2005 stated that historical flood records lack comprehensiveness standardization quality control and scientific rigor a plethora of studies has investigated the changing and variable rainfall observed over the sahel rainfall characteristics are changing in the sahel at large from east to west daily rainfall data from both ground observations and satellites indicate an increase in the frequency of extreme events the intensity of rain and the inter annual variability sulieman and elagib 2012 ly et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 these results reveal an increasing intensity and occurrence probability of extreme rainfall rather than a rainfall recovery roughly since the beginning of the 21st century with the intensification being stronger in the eastern sahel than the western sahel panthou et al 2018 rivers in the sahel have demonstrated changes in their flows analyses of discharge data of the senegal and niger rivers indicate an intensification of the hydrological signal in the western sahel modification of the hydrological regimes in these rivers is demonstrated by an increase in the annual maxima wilcox et al 2018 and a twin peak hydrograph descroix et al 2012 in 2010 2012 and 2013 the niger river recorded the highest discharge peaks ever since the 1920s casse and gosset 2015 the flows of the nile river in the eastern sahel show successive above average anomalies during the 21st century taye and willems 2012 basheer and elagib 2019 basheer et al 2021 elagib et al 2021a investigations into the occurrence of heavy rainfall and rain induced floods and their causes in the sahel region are necessary because of the devastation these events bring to people and properties e g loss of lives and destruction of houses and infrastructures as well as to the environment and socioeconomic systems tarhule 2005 floods also cause interruption to primary health care facilities and services abbas and routray 2013 therefore we investigate the flood risk in the african sahel region in light of recent rainfall and river flow tendencies outlooks for skillful flood forecasts and adaptation are remarked a viewpoint is established in a hope for guiding individual societal and regional activities 2 study area the sahel is around 3 1 million km2 body of land spanning 5 900 km across an arid and semi arid belt of africa from east to west between the saharan desert the rainforests of central africa and the guinean coast fig 1 the region stretches from senegal and gambia on the atlantic coast through mali mauritania burkina faso nigeria niger chad and sudan to the northwestern part of ethiopia and eritrea on the red sea coast a total of 407 4 million people were estimated to live in the 11 sahel countries as of 2014 table 1 this population is projected to reach 597 9 million by 2030 grassland shrubs and small thorny trees are the main land covers in the region the importance of the region originates from its abundant human cultural and natural resources however risks of climate change poor soil growing population and increasing pressure on the natural resources challenge the sustainable development poverty reduction and environmental restoration of the sahel region mohamed 2011 sissoko et al 2011 elagib et al 2021b despite its concomitant vulnerability to the impacts of climatic variability and land degradation subsistence agricultural activities constitute the dominant contributor to the sahel economy food security and livelihoods 3 materials and methods 3 1 flood related statistics this study used secondary data on the number of affected people direct deaths and destroyed and damaged houses and disease outbreaks and deaths related to flood events unless otherwise indicated these data were compiled from reports of the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha reliefweb and floodlist depending on the availability of country level data these sources provide annual situation reports including statistics on the above stated attributes for this study a follow up of the reporting updates was ensured to obtain the latest statistics for sudan these data were extracted from ocha situation reports for the period 1998 2020 examining these data enables diagnosing the flood phenomena in terms of the exposure to danger harm or loss i e risk 3 2 spatio temporal maximum daily rainfall in this research the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps version 2 0 rainfall product was selected for assessing extreme events over sudan and the sahel the chirps dataset is developed and maintained by the u s geological survey usgs and the climate hazards group of the university of california funk et al 2015 and was selected for two reasons first it has a long daily time series 1981 to date with a spatial resolution of around 5 km second validation results ranked the performance of chirps highest using multiple rainfall indices across east and sub saharan africa dinku et al 2018 harrison et al 2019 the maximum rainfall value for each pixel was calculated and visualized for the sahel countries and for the eastern and western sahel over the period from 1981 to 2019 3 3 flood inundation photographs and mapping photographs were requested by the authors through personal communications with freelance press photographers photography hobbyists and colleagues in order to document flood incidents and threats additionally landsat 8 satellite images were retrieved from the united states geological survey usgs data center to detect flood areas as explained below cloud cover was a limiting factor in processing the images and identifying flood areas a floodwater detection method al zayed and elagib 2017 was used to identify flood areas in 2019 and 2020 the method utilizes the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the evaporative fraction ef to detect water pixels it is known that water pixels have negative ndvi values pettorelli et al 2005 ma et al 2007 and have high ef values of 0 75 1 0 al zayed et al 2016 both the ndvi and ef were calculated using landsat 8 satellite images with a 30 m spatial resolution the ndvi was derived from the reflectivity corrected red band 4 and near infrared band 5 bands using the equation band 5 band 4 band 5 band 4 as described by vermote et al 2016 ef was derived by retrieving the land surface temperature lst from the thermal band band 10 after radiance conversion based on the methodology of usgs 2019 as follows ef lsth lstx lsth lstc where lsth is the average of three hot pixels taken from the land lstc is the average of three cold water pixels and lstx is the lst pixel value for the satellite image for the 2019 flood event a total of 146 satellite images covering sudan paths 171 179 rows 45 52 were processed for the periods before and after the rainy event of 9 10 august 2019 that caused widespread flooding nine images were selected and analyzed to capture flash floodwater considering the cloud cover and spatial representation of the sudanese states for the 2020 flood event fifteen satellite images with minimal cloud cover were selected and processed to capture the flood along some reaches of the nile river 3 4 river water levels daily river water level data were obtained for the khartoum river gage located on the nile in khartoum city sudan s capital these data cover the 1954 2020 period each year in this period was classified into normal alert critical or flooding based on the maximum daily river water level and the riverine flood alarm thresholds used for khartoum gage by the ministry of irrigation and water resources of sudan this analysis enabled understanding the change in the severity occurrence and frequency of nile riverine floods 3 5 probability and return period of maximum rainfall time series of the maximum daily rainfall occurring in a year as obtained from chirps were employed to construct a mathematical relationship that estimates the rainfall with a given probability of exceedance and a return period two approaches as described by mansell 2003 were compared the first approach involves ranking the data in descending order and using weibull s formula given by eqs 1 and 2 bellow 1 p m n 1 2 t 1 p where p is the probability of exceedance m is the rank n is the data size and t is the return period in years the maximum rainfall return period relationship was plotted in a normal log form in the second approach the gumbel distribution form was used as follows gumbel distribution relies on two parameters namely the mean μ and the standard deviation σ of the data under analysis the maximum rainfall for a given return period can be obtained based on the cumulative distribution 3 r μ 6 π σ y 0 5772 6 π σ where y is the reduced variate and is given as 4 y l n ln 1 1 t the probability of a rainfall r exceeding a given rainfall r is calculated based on the following equation 5 p r r 1 e x p e x p y where y can be obtained by rearranging eq 3 to give 6 y r 0 5772 6 π σ μ 6 π σ then the return period of a magnitude of rainfall is obtained using eq 2 3 6 meteorological causes of the most recent disastrous floods to enrich the discussion on the major meteorological factors influencing the flood events the causes of the 2019 and 2020 floods in sudan were linked to the atmospheric moisture budget the monthly total columnar water vapor tcwv the tropospheric moisture flux and the flux divergence were obtained from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf product era5 hersbach et al 2020 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 the anomalies for the 2019 and 2020 wet seasons of the above mentioned variables were calculated with respect to the 1981 2010 mean 3 7 literature review secondary data in the form of published scientific literature were used to identify the documented flood events during the recent past support the present analysis of flood frequency ascribe the flood incidents and impacts and explore the existing and potential attempts to flood forecasting in the region this literature is cited in the relevant sections and appropriately detailed in the reference list 4 results 4 1 flood occurrence distribution and magnitude during the period 1981 2019 the chirps data show a highest rainfall recorded in one day across the sahel region of 216 9 mm fig 2 a out of the 39 year data record 21 maxima occurred in the eastern sahel while 18 maxima were recorded in the western sahel fig 2b the chirps data plotted in fig 2b show that the maximum rainfall in the eastern sahel excluding eritrea often occurs during the last week of july to mid august in eritrea the maximum occurs during mid march to mid april the western sahel experiences the maximum rainfall in the period from the last week of july to the end of august following the peak sahel drought in the 1980s the literature has reported flood occurrences across the region in 1995 1998 1999 2002 2003 2005 2006 2007 2008 2012 2013 2014 and 2017 williams and nottage 2006 tschakert et al 2010 paeth et al 2011 samimi et al 2012 boyd et al 2013 mahmood et al 2017 adegoke et al 2019 the spatial distribution of the maximum daily rainfall recorded for these years is depicted in fig 2c sahel wide this maximum occurs mostly in the far west the south central part eastern sudan or the far east the highest daily rainfall recorded during 1981 2019 is displayed in fig 2d during the first fortnight of august 2019 a heavy rainstorm developed over a large part of sudan top left corner in fig 3 unlike the locally unprecedented 200 mm storm of 1988 in khartoum hulme and trilsbach 1989 the extent of wet conditions leading to flooding on the 9th and 10th of august 2019 across sudan was exceptionally vast fig 3 many parts of the country received a high proportion of their august rain in this storm based on the weibull probability formula the frequency curves of maximum daily rainfall are shown in fig 4 the results are given for the eastern western and entire sahel region in addition to four selected sahelian countries which have been frequently reported to encounter flood events the results in fig 4 are compared with those obtained using the gumbel distribution function see table 2 the table shows approximately similar results concerning the maximum rainfall at short return periods at long return periods the difference in rainfall estimates between the two approaches diverges as for riverine flood events the nile river in the eastern part of the sahel is a striking case to perceive for instance the 67 year long time series of the maximum water levels of the blue nile recorded at the capital of sudan fig 5 manifests 27 40 3 occurrences of flood alarms 18 26 9 critical cases and 19 28 4 alert events against only 3 4 5 normal years the 21st century has so far been unequivocal in its increasing nile flows during the last decade alone khartoum witnessed 8 flood alarms with increasing severity comparing fig 5 with fig 2c the synchronous occurrence of extreme rainfall in the eastern sahel and nile water levels representing alert critical and flooding events is evident in 2020 the nile water level at khartoum reached an unprecedented level 380 65 m asl which exceeded the peak levels reached in 1946 380 1 m asl and in 1988 379 94 m asl as reported by davies and walsh 1997 subsequent to rainfall in the source region of the nile particularly the ethiopian highlands an exceptionally widespread fluvial flooding developed in sudan during august and september the water levels of all dam reservoirs in sudan increased and some of the nile river tributaries overflowed fig 6 4 2 flood impacts in the eastern sahel particularly sudan not only were the years 2019 and 2020 characteristic of flood impacts but they were also part of a state of more than two decades of spatio temporal losses of property and lives fig 7 for instance unusually early rainy season with heavy and persistent rain in 1999 caused severe and widespread floods in central sudan williams and nottage 2006 affecting 1 841 180 people destroying 30 707 houses and damaging 64 350 houses fig 7 compared to the 1988 flood hulme and trilsbach 1989 sutcliffe et al 1989 the severity of the 2019 flood event in sudan did not prompt immediate and substantial world attention to catalyze relief actions a few television networks broadcasted scenes of mass havoc in the aftermath the government of sudan was challenged by an economic recession and environmental and health disasters to place the 2019 flooding in sudan in the sahelian context we compare its impacts with the well documented 2007 flood event of the sahel in 2007 the west sahelian floods affected 429 376 people displaced 84059 and killed 153 boyd et al 2013 as of 21 november 2019 the 2019 flood affected 426 300 people led to the death of 78 people damaged 35 725 houses and destroyed 49 535 houses in sudan alone the year 2019 s flooding in sudan disconnected 123 villages in the white nile state from access by relief campaigns assayha 2019 in niger in the western sahel heavy rains and flooding of the niger river in 2019 affected 211 366 people killed 57 people and damaged 16 375 houses in 2020 the sahel flooding resulted in 2 006 000 affected people 181 500 destroyed houses and 417 deaths with 56 4 54 5 and 62 3 of these numbers respectively reported across sudan alone fig 8 from both fluvial or pluvial floods heavy rains and river flooding across chad including the capital n djamena in 2020 caused ravages thus affecting 64 670 households or 388 000 people displacing hundreds of thousands of people destroying hundreds of thousands of hectares of cultivated land washing away thousands of cattle and inundating storekeepers stocks in markets based on figs 3 and 7 one can infer that the most disrupted areas in terms of the number of affected people in sudan are occasionally located adjacent to river streams e g northern gezira white nile khartoum kassala and sennar states densely populated urban centers the capital khartoum state and engulfed by huge wadis e g north kurdofan state in 2020 pluvial floods affected north darfur state the most whereas the most affected states as a result of rivers that overflowed their banks were khartoum blue nile sennar and gezira states figs 6 and 8a flash and riverine flood damages pose major threats in the sahel region exemplary of these threats are best depicted in figs 9 and 10 for the 2019 and 2020 flood disasters in sudan respectively the nile floodwater inundated a large number of farmlands fig 10a c the 2020 flash and riverine floods damaged approximately 2 2 million hectares of croplands in sudan and consequently put vulnerable households at risk of food insecurity an additional salient feature is the health impacts due to the widespread presence of stagnant floodwaters during the flood seasons of 2019 and 2020 mosquitos found breeding grounds in 2019 a cholera outbreak in sudan started in september following the august flash floods the first cases were reported in the states adjacent to south sudan likely related to a large number of refugees without access to clean drinking water or sanitation who mostly rely on open defecation the cholera outbreak rapidly spread to more than eight states in sudan due to the movement of people due to the quick response of the sudanese government in announcing the cholera outbreak calling for local and international organizations to provide health and food assistance the cholera cases were limited malaria in sudan breached the epidemic threshold in 2019 as over 1 8 million cases were reported the collapse of pit latrines fig 9a totaling more than 5000 in 2019 and 16 000 in 2020 and the mixture of their contents with floodwater represented breeding grounds for several water borne diseases such as cholera water resources were extensively damaged in 13 states due to contamination floodwater mixed with solid waste in residential areas was noticed during the flood of september 2020 many collection points of solid waste inside flood zones were inundated and waste of different types mixed with floodwater and represented a source of water pollution fig 10f reported disease outbreaks and casualties across sudan during the period from 9 august 2019 to 8 january 2020 were 97 cases of diphtheria including 13 deaths 4225 dengue fever cases including 13 deaths 572 rift valley fever cases 11 deaths 296 chikungunya cases including 5 deaths and 346 cholera cases 11 deaths in september 2020 120 cases of fever attributed to floods including 8 deaths were reported in the northern state in sudan by the federal ministry of health 2020a as a result of lessons learned from the 2019 flood disaster the sudanese government fought to avoid another cholera outbreak in 2020 by preparing emergency response plans for the whole country fedral ministry of health 2020b in 2020 a special focus was devoted to the most affected states in the country khartoum sennar and northern states 5 discussion albeit in varying magnitude and place of occurrence the above findings and data are striking in the sense that floods in the sahel have become recurrent and their impacts have become more devastating in the eastern sahel particularly sudan pluvial and fluvial flood occurrences are not unique in the history of record of the last two centuries hulme and trilsbach 1989 sutcliffe et al 1989 walsh et al 1994 this section traces the possible causal factors associated with the past flood events in the region the opportunities for and the challenges to skillful seasonal rainfall or flood forecasts a hopeful discussion on how to move forward toward flood risk management is also provided 5 1 causes of floods the rainfall results reported above identify extreme rainfall consecutive daily rainfall events and high river water levels as hydroclimatic causes of floods it is to be noted that the rise in the streamflow of the nile i e from the blue nile and white nile subsequent to cumulative rainfall amounts in these regions was the main hydroclimatic reason for the riverine flood in sudan in 2020 fig 6 such concurrent nile and flash floods are not unusual in the history of records a similar case was reported in the 1988 flood year sutcliffe et al 1989 walsh et al 1994 davies and walsh 1997 one could back the impact statistics in fig 7 with the recurrence analysis of maximum daily rainfall given in table 2 the table indicates a maximum daily rainfall of 117 0 mm based on the weibull formula or 120 7 mm based on gumbel distribution can occur in sudan at least once in 2 years such an amount of daily rain is extreme for a region with arid and semi arid climate conditions that receives a median annual rainfall of 87 2 to 658 4 mm elagib 2009 a cautionary note should be made here that the absolutes of return values might have been underestimated due to the use of chirps kpanou et al 2021 presented proof that chrips has lower 95th percentiles than rain gauge values due to its algorithm the influence of sea surface temperatures on the sahel interannual rainfall variability i e the observed characteristics of wet and dry years in the sahel are explained by previous studies nicholson and webster 2007 hagos and cook 2008 there remains however a question of whether the observed increase in rainfall intensity is influenced by large scale changes in the atmospheric circulation or more local factors enhancing the convection intensity or both panthou et al 2014 cook 2008 argues that the future may hold additional important influences multi decadal satellite observations from the western sahel reveal rapid intensification of mesoscale convective systems which are suggested to be strongly related to the global land temperature but weakly related to the recovery of annual rainfall taylor et al 2017 the influence of anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing is also suggested to have played a role in the recent as well as the sustenance of recovery in the sahel rainfall haarsma et al 2005 dong and sutton 2015 ficchì and stephens 2019 found an influence of the patterns of variability of the indian ocean dipole iod and el niño southern oscillation enso on the timing of the start of the rainy season that translates into changes in river flood timing in sub saharan africa particularly east africa the wetter than normal rainy season in 2017 over west africa including the western sahel was linked to the propagation of more intense larger and colder mesoscale convective systems across the region adegoke et al 2019 mekonen 2020 attributed the above average rainfall in the sahel in 2019 with its largest positive anomalies in chad and sudan and drier conditions along the guinea and western coastal regions to persistently below average sea surface temperatures off the coast of west africa later in the year 2019 a record breaking iod led to extreme wet conditions in the headwaters of the white nile wainwright et al 2020 the extreme rains in the blue nile catchment in june september 2020 could be partly attributed to a developing weak la niña conditions la niña is known to enhance the rains during the ethiopian kiremt rainy season june september fig 11 a d show the mean and anomalous atmospheric water vapor flux vectors for august 2020 for sudan and its surroundings fig 11b reveals anomalous and convergent westerly moisture flux in the belt 10 14 n where the climatological moisture flux is easterly fig 11a a cyclonic flow in central west sudan which can be interpreted as a vertically deeper and northward displacement of westerly monsoon flow is evident fig 11d exhibits anomalously high total columnar water vapor content tcwv values that prevailed in the entire region in august 2020 with strong anomalies in the order of 15 20 in the area of the strongest climatological zonal moisture gradient between 14 and 18 n fig 11c it is worth mentioning that the entire sahel experienced positive rainfall anomalies during the 2020 west african monsoon season of which august was the peak month unlike in the first half of the 20th century wetter kiremt rains over the ethiopian highlands in the more recent period 1969 1999 were related to anomalous westerly flow across the sahel bahaga et al 2019 their fig s3 moreover a significant positive correlation with the atlantic meridional oscillation amo emerged the 2020 sahel and kiremt rains align with this recent multidecadal trend since the amo was positive with the largest amplitude in august 2020 https psl noaa gov data correlation amon us data while anomalies of moisture flux weakened in september not shown in fig 11 the troposphere remained anomalously moist over the region likely facilitating the development of convective rainstorms the observations reported above with respect to the most recurrently flood disrupted areas in sudan figs 3 6 9 and 10 concur with reports in the literature of the sahel at large an increase in the number of flood events per year has been recently reported with urban areas suffering catastrophic consequences mahmood et al 2017 de risi et al 2018 adegoke et al 2019 tazen et al 2019 many flood events and impacts are traced back to proximity to or settlement in flood prone areas e g rivers flood plains wadis and low lying areas clay silt soil that is compacted or of low infiltration capacity inadequate drainage systems lack of adaptation experience poor quality of housing changes in land use bad governance weak institutional capacity and or poor urban planning hulme and trilsbach 1989 walsh et al 1994 tarhule 2005 mahmoud et al 2014 2017 de risi et al 2018 horn and elagib 2018 adegoke et al 2019 tazen et al 2019 in the eastern nile the changes in land use cover and degradation of the upper blue nile basin in ethiopia increased high flows and decreased low flows bewket and sterk 2005 woldesenbet et al 2017 5 2 potential for climate and flood projection forecasting and modeling climate projections of the mean changes in sahel rainfall for the 21st century remain uncertain even under the latest coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 model experiments although the ensemble mean rainfall shows a robust increase in the central and eastern parts monerie et al 2020 projections indicate a likelihood of an increase in rainfall intensity over most of the sahel rather than lengthening of the wet season vizy et al 2013 under climate change climate model simulations further suggest an increase in the total annual and the year to year variability of the nile flow in the 21st century siam and eltahir 2017 according to recent modeling scenarios extreme precipitation events e g extremely and consecutive wet days are expected to increase in the future in the central and eastern sahel in contrast to west africa diedhiou et al 2018 aziz et al 2019 tegegne et al 2020 the likely intensification of extreme and heavy precipitation events in ethiopia tegegne et al 2020 implies amplification of the probability of intense runoff and flood risks in the eastern sahel however almost all studies are thus far based on global or regional climate models that do not explicitly resolve the rain bearing convective systems over africa e g salih et al 2018 here simulating future storms at convection permitting resolution holds large promises in providing more confidence in predicting future extreme rainfall events as shown recently by kendon et al 2019 and finney et al 2020 cumulative rainfall during consecutive rainy days appears to drive flooding in parts of the sahel region for example in niger taylor et al 2017 in east africa the influence of positive and negative phases of both iod and enso can cause a difference in timing of the river flood of more than three months ficchì and stephens 2019 thus skillful iod and enso seasonal predictions have a high potential for useful flood predictions we notice from the literature for the eastern part of the sahel e g khartoum that floods took place repeatedly during the first fortnight of august i e the peak of the rainy season hulme and trilsbach 1989 williams and nottage 2006 mahmood et al 2017 following the drought era the western sahel zone appears to be confronting severe flood events almost throughout the first three weeks of august tarhule 2005 paeth et al 2011 samimi et al 2012 this information could guide forecasters prediction experts to improve the skillfulness of models during these periods of the season to improve the preparedness for flood management patt et al 2007 concluded that developing user specific forecasts and interactive communication is key to the success of the programs intended to utilize climate forecasting in africa in climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction the following part of this section offers an overview of attempts made to date to provide seasonal rainfall or flood forecast and modeling for the sahel region the use of data on sea surface temperature anomalies and enso to issue seasonal rainfall predictions has been in practice by the west african climate outlook forums since 1998 tschakert et al 2010 similarly these predictors have been in use by the igad climate prediction and application centre icpac of the intergovernmental authority on development igad in delivering climate services to eastern africa including the east african sahel countries for sahelian catchments in the west african sahel nka et al 2015 found significant coherence between flood trends and trends in the maximum 5 day consecutive rainfall however they recommended using hydrological models to overcome the limitations inherent in the statistical rainfall runoff relationship analysis which overlooks the spatial and temporal variability in specific hydrological processes amarnath et al 2016 used the hydrologic modeling system hec hms to simulate the rainfall runoff processes to improve flood forecasting in the gash river basin in ethiopia and sudan the hec hms model was supplemented with a land use map digital elevation model dem inputs and the soil conservation service scs curve number cn and scs unit hydrograph uh techniques to transform rainfall into runoff the simulation performed well for river discharge values of lower than 200 m3 s compared to conventional forecasting methods the flood forecast model improved the near real time application by 12 h however amarnath et al 2016 emphasized the imperativeness of augmenting the data inputs to the model such as catchment characteristics e g evapotranspiration and land use change impacts on the water balance in addition to water abstraction in the upstream areas recently fiorillo and tarchiani 2017 proposed a flooding risk evaluation method frem for small medium basins based on a simplified version of the soil water assessment tool swat integrated with remote sensing geographic information systems gis and field surveys adopted at sub basin level in niger they argued that the physically based method is computationally efficient a similar hydrological method was also used to develop catchment response to climate and land use changes in the upper blue nile sub basins in ethiopia woldesenbet et al 2018 the sudan ministry of water resources and irrigation developed a flood forecasting system for the flows of the gash river a transboundary basin shared between ethiopia eritrea and sudan using integrated satellite based rainfall estimates and evapotranspiration gis scs cn and scs uh and hec hms to share information on arriving floods with farmers through smart information and communication technology ict in the gash delta of eastern sudan amarnath et al 2018 the work demonstrated a high potential for enabling the farmers to apply this information and manage their decisions for optimizing farm profits due to scant data babker et al 2020 demonstrated the applicability of the scs cn method coupled with gis land use cover maps dem soil data and freely accessible gridded rainfall estimates for estimating the floodwater in the transboundary baraka river basin in eritrea and sudan the approach proved successful for floodwater harvesting current model based seasonal forecasting of rainfall does not explicitly resolve convection as the spatial resolution is usually too coarse lead time dependent bias corrections are thus mandatory e g lorenz et al 2020 as a reference the latter authors provide bias corrected and spatially disaggregated daily precipitation ensemble forecasts for the blue nile this attempt holds the promise to develop an improved ensemble flood forecast for that catchment 5 3 way forward the ability to attribute causes of changing magnitude and frequency of floods is compounded by several factors including precipitation extremes and characteristics causative mechanisms of storms changes in antecedent hydrologic conditions water storage and management land use changes variations and trends in seasonal sea temperatures etc quantifying these changes provides a crucial information base for optimizing our response and adaptation hirsch and archfield 2015 sharma et al 2018 climate variability over the last three decades should guide the management of rainfall dependent activities and sectors conway 2011 the present analysis should prompt more attention to floods side by side with the prolonged focus on drought events in order to capture the best interventions to manage both climate stressors on the region there exist attempts to offer seasonal rainfall or flood forecast for the sahel region however they remain humble in view of recurring catastrophic floods the results of the present investigation on the timing of occurrence of extreme rainfall in the eastern and western parts of the sahel represent possible forward looking information for flood prediction understanding climate related impacts and opportunities helps make societies resilient to future climate variability and change pielke jr 2005 however to make effective adaptation decisions in the face of uncertain climate predictions the vulnerability of climate dependent decisions and the various means of reducing this vulnerability need to be well understood by the vulnerable societies dessai et al 2009 knowledge about future sahel floods needs to guide relevant adaptation plans by adapting to the inevitable climate change and variability we could substantially reduce the number of those at increased risk of storm flooding parry et al 1998 however the lack of attention to flood risks in the sahel hinders the development of effective flood adaptation plans it is high time now that the effect of mere onlookers within the communities of hydrology and climate sciences and policymaking come into play flood in the sahel is currently viewed as an abnormality this unviable attitude results in perceiving rainfall as a liability rather than a potential asset exactly similar to the attitude used to justify failing to integrate drought characteristics into the planning process hulme 1987 amid the ever synchrony of dry and wet conditions in the region concerns about opportunities for floodwater harvesting should be stimulated to attenuate water scarcity in the region health wise the control measures for cholera are vaccination for short term mitigation and securing clean water supply for the affected regions for long term prevention comprehensive vaccination would reduce future outbreaks because it treats the asymptomatic carriers who would otherwise become a disease source control of mosquito transmitted diseases is more complicated than cholera studies within the sahel proved that this vector could migrate with the wind for distances as far as 300 km to affect other areas huestis et al 2019 hence these diseases could be described as transboundary and must be controlled by inter regional plans in the year 2017 the world health organization who approved theglobal vector control response gvcr which should guide actions to prevent diseases and responses to outbreaks who 2017 the ministry of health of khartoum state in sudan launched an insecticide spraying campaign in cooperation with localities to combat flies and mosquitoes across the state sudan news agency 2020 all plans and actions toward flood risk reduction necessitate reliable information on projected hydroclimate changes taylor et al 2017 demand for information to make decisions is high in the region likewise in many parts of africa conway 2011 updated return periods of river discharges are imperative to ensure protection against floods and better river basin management wilcox et al 2018 relevant and reliable climate information is needed in managing all climate sensitive diseases thomson et al 2011 unfortunately the lack of recognition of the high flood risk and the paucity of data constrain relevant research and mitigation efforts tarhule 2005 6 conclusions the authors herein adopted a primary and secondary data integration method to study the recent sahel pluvial and fluvial flood hazards causes status quo and forward looking plans and actions for reducing the flood risks in the region in light of the present investigation it seems that the region is as liable to suffer from frequent floods as it is prone to multi decadal droughts the consequent massive flood of 2019 and 2020 in the sahel together with a sequence of yearly occurrence of heavy rainfall events during the past two decades provide compelling evidence of an increasing risk of floods in the region addressing both extremes through a holistic risk management approach allows for better identification of relevant tradeoffs and synergies ward et al 2020 changes in natural patterns of climate variability and rainfall intensity human interference in the physical environment soil characteristics and poor urban planning and governance are key influential factors in the increase of flood risk attempts made to date to communicate timely seasonal rainfall or flood forecasts remain humble given that widespread havoc and devastation are becoming commonplace unlike droughts the looming disaster brought about by the recent frequent floods in the sahel is largely omitted worldwide among researchers and policymakers similar to the long lasting sahel drought of the 1970s and 1980s a persistence of the flood risks would not surprise anyone if the recent history is any guide and given the expected climate change scenarios against the backdrop of alternating flood and drought risks to resources e g water land and energy and the environment in the sahel zone overlooking the characteristic flood situation in the hydroclimate of the sahel is no longer viable 7 data availability statement the flood related statistics data that support the findings of this study are

4466,we consider stochastic weather models originally developed for rainfall simulations to build a hierarchical bayesian mixture model for daily rainfall forecasts using endogenous and external information we model daily rainfall as a seasonal varying mixture of a bernoulli distribution for rainfall occurrence and a gamma distribution for the rainfall amount the model scheme allows the inclusion of predictors to reduce the bias and variance of the forecasts while the hierarchical bayesian framework promotes a better understanding and reduction in parameter uncertainties especially for gauges with short records as well as supports the estimation of regional parameters that could be employed for forecasts at ungauged sites the model was tested using 47 years 1973 2019 of daily rainfall data from 60 gauges in south korea climate indices derived from the low level wind over the region were analyzed using principal component analysis pca and embodied into the model to enhance its forecast skills the model structure was based on a detailed exploratory data analysis which included the application of self organizing maps som to examine the spatio temporal patterns of rainfall cross validated results reveal improved skills over reference models based on climatology and persistence up to a three days lead time the average gains in metrics such as the brier and winkler skill scores vary from 5 to 50 while the average correlation skill between predictions and observations reach values up to 0 55 the gains beyond a three days lead time are marginal but the underlying structure of the proposed model still encourages its use over the reference models being a step forward in improving real time daily rainfall forecasts for the region it has also a great potential to be combined with weather model forecasts and applied in other places across the world keywords daily rainfall forecasts hierarchical bayesian model climate information bernoulli gamma model 1 introduction the predictions of daily rainfall a few days out have many relevant applications for society it is of particular interest their use as forcing into hydrological bartholmes and todini 2005

systems e g the brasilian hydropower system seecollischonn et al 2007 to provide such information a variety of global and regional weather models have developed along the years mcbride and ebert 2000 lin et al 2005 mittermaier 2007 luitel et al 2018 as they intend to simulate a large number of variables by numerically solving the governing physical equations of the complex and non linear climate system they need to rely on parametrizations e g cloud parametrization spatio temporal discretizations of the physical domain and active knowledge of initial conditions that inevitably lead to uncertainties in model formulation which is generally addressed by ensemble forecasts and their statistical post processing e g vannitsem et al 2018 as they provide forecasts for a grid cell it is always a challenge to compare and evaluate the ensemble forecasts accuracy with point based observations in gauge stations as a result daily rainfall forecasts directly provided by weather models may contain a large bias and variance vidale et al 2003 ebert et al 2003 accadia et al 2005 bürger 2009 cuo et al 2011 shrestha et al 2013 baxter et al 2014 wang 2015 sharma et al 2017 xu et al 2018

those from reference models based on climatology statistics e g mean variance spatio temporal correlations derived from observations external information which could include climate predictors and even rainfall predictions from weather models could be included in the empirical models to improve the forecast skills particularly at seasonal scales e g sharma 2000 singhrattna et al 2005 the large majority of statistical models for rainfall predictions however have most often being applied for rainfall simulations which are conceptually different from rainfall forecasts the former is the quantitative reproduction of the behavior of a system given some defined inputs but without reference to any observed outputs while forecasting is the quantitative reproduction of the behavior of a system ahead of time but given observations of the inputs state variables where applicable and outputs up to the present time the forecasting origin beven and young 2013 perhaps the most common rainfall models for simulation are the so called stochastic weather generator models richardson 1981 wilks and wilby 1999 rasmussen 2013 mehrotra et al 2015 gao et al 2018 vallam and qin 2016 diez sierra and del jesus 2017 verdin et al 2018 oriani et al 2018 verdin et al 2019 which attempt to simulate daily rainfall sequences while preserving important statistics observed in historical records the first generators however often failed to simulate key aspects of daily rainfall including dry spells extremes marginal distributions correlation structure statistical properties across scales and low frequency variability attempts to address these and other issues have been made using a variety of methods including wavelet and non parametric approaches sharma and lall 1999 rajagopalan and lall

preserve the marginal distribution and the correlation structure papalexiou 2018 papalexiou et al 2018 papalexiou and serinaldi 2020 more recently a large number of applications of weather generator models are towards statistical downscaling of weather model forecasts and climate change projections bellone et al 2000 bürger 2009 wilks 2010 mehrotra and sharma 2010 mehrotra et al 2013 langousis

et al 2020 for daily rainfall simulations herein we propose a statistical forecast model that relies on the concepts of stochastic weather generator models and includes endogenous past rainfall and exogenous large scale climate information predictors the inference is carried out in a hierarchical bayesian framework which drives better estimates of model parameters and a more proper assessment of the parameter uncertainties of rainfall forecasts as generator models for daily rainfall simulation usually comprise a mixture of distributions one for the rainfall occurrence e g bernoulli and one for the rainfall amount e g log normal or gamma the proposed model consists of a bernoulli gamma mixture of distributions for rainfall occurrence and amount where predictors can be included in both distributions leading to a nonstationary model some recent studies indicate that a heavy tailed distribution is in general more appropriate for the rainfall amounts wilson and toumi 2005 papalexiou et al 2013 cavanaugh et al 2015 langousis et al 2016b nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 papalexiou et al 2018 rajulapati et al 2020 we offer here a nonstationary gamma model for the rainfall amounts which can be viewed as a mixture of gamma distributions where the time varying parameters will reflect the changes in the proportions of the mixture it is very unlikely that daily rainfall from typical events comes from the same process e g convective frontal tropical storms etc or distribution as the extremes so a mixture or similar is conceptually and theoretically warranted we show in the supplementary material that a mixture of gamma distributions is able to simulate highly skewed data and the empirical density of observed daily rainfall data the choice of the gamma distribution for the mixture is also for convenience as it is perhaps the most used distribution in such applications it does not imply however that the use of other nonstationary distributions in our model could lead to better results in specific cases we expect that the addition of predictors will lead to conditional independence across rainfall sites so that the spatial correlations across them are likely preserved in the forecasts the model is structured in a way that not only improves the accuracy of the forecasts compared with reference models based on climatologies but also allows a smooth transition with respect to the lead times of the forecasts between the usefulness of including predictors and thus acting as a forecast model and using solely the historical information acting more as a simulation model such scheme does not require a model selection procedure over the forecast time horizon the proposed model is evaluated using 47 years 1973 2019 of historical data from 60 rainfall gauges located in south korea forecasts or hindcastings using the concept proposed in beven and young 2013 utilizing up to 7 days lead times and an independent testing period are used for cross validation to compare standard forecast skill metrics with those from reference models based on climatology the previous rainfall and low level wind field provided by reanalysis data are used as predictors after this introduction this study is organized as follows the climate data are presented in section 2 an exploratory data analysis of the rainfall data and their relations with the wind field data including the application of principal component analysis pca and self organizing maps som is presented in section 3 the methodology describing the proposed hierarchical bayesian model for daily rainfall forecasts its inference and evaluation are offered in section 4 the outcomes of the proposed forecasting model which includes the evaluation of forecast skill metrics is illustrated in section 5 finally in section 6 we offer a summary and the main conclusions of this paper 2 rainfall and climate information data daily rainfall series from 60 rainfall gauges located in korea fig 1 are used to evaluate the proposed model the rainfall data are provided by the automatic synoptic observation system asos operated from the korean meteorological administration kma and cover the 1973 2019 historical period the daily wind field data for the period 1973 2019 are provided by the ncep ncar reanalysis project kalnay et al 1996 and are available at the website https iridl ldeo columbia edu sources noaa ncep ncar cdas 1 we focus on the low level wind averaged over the 1000 925 850 700 mb pressure levels the wind field is extracted over the domain 120 w 134 w longitude and 30 n 42 n latitude which covers the entire korean peninsula resulting in 30 grid points of data an exploratory analysis of the rainfall and wind field data is presented in the next section 3 exploratory data analysis 3 1 analysis of rainfall over south korea a general view of the seasonal pattern of total daily rainfall over korea is shown in fig 2 the peak occurs in july and is associated with the summer season in the region during this time there is a strong tropical moisture export from the yellow sea and east china sea fig 3 b the meridional wind is predominantly positive i e from south to north conversely the lowest rainfall takes place in january during the winter season whereas the wind field is generally from the asian continent fig 3a resulting in poor moisture transport the meridional wind is mostly negative i e from north to south in this case it is worth mentioning that the zonal wind remains positive from west to east during both months 3 2 the influence of the wind field over the rainfall in south korea fig 4 shows the distribution of the spatial average over the domain shown in fig 3 meridional wind for the year it is interesting to note that incursion retreat of low level moisture from the yellow and east china seas can also occur during the winter summer period as positive negative values can occur during these times suggesting a highly variable wind and the occurrence of rainfall episodes during the dry season likewise dry spells are also likely to occur during the wet season the variability of the meridional wind is further evaluated by applying principal component analysis pca seewilks 2006 for further details to the data fig 5 displays the loadings of the two main modes of variability which account for roughly 84 of the data variance 63 first pc 21 of second pc the main mode has a common pattern of variation resembling a spatial average across the grid the second mode has a zonal seesaw kind of pattern with the center crossing the korean peninsula the third component corresponds to only 6 of the data variance and is not shown here the temporal components of the first two pcs are showed in the supplementary material a preliminary attempt to investigate the influence of meridional wind on the spatio temporal variability of the daily rainfall over korea is conducted by applying self organizing map som to the daily rainfall data soms is a clustering technique based on artificial neural networks that has found many applications in hydrology and climate sciences the underlying methodology makes it very appropriate for large datasets which is our case here we refer the reader to cavazos 2000 kohonen 2001 li et al 2015 lima et al 2017 and the references therein for further details examples and explanation about soms we employed the kohonen package available for the r software wehrens and buydens 2007 wehrens and kruisselbrink 2018 we applied then som to the entire daily rainfall sequence in order to obtain different clusters that could reveal spatio temporal patterns of daily rainfall over korea for each day of the historical record som produces a cluster index the total number of clusters i e number of nodes is a tune parameter of som and we set it as six arranged and connected in a hexagonal grid after visually evaluating the rainfall patterns that emerge from changing the total number of clusters these patterns are evaluated by a composite analysis for each rainfall gauge we estimate its composite mean over time for each cluster index the final result is a spatio temporal picture of daily rainfall over korea for each cluster index fig 6 displays the six clusters obtained after applying som to the rainfall dataset we observe the following features for each cluster cluster 1 moderate rainfall uniformly distributed over korea marginally peaking in the southern part of the region cluster 2 low rainfall uniformly distributed over korea cluster 3 no or very little occurrence of rainfall over the entire korea cluster 4 high rainfall particularly in the southern region cluster 5 high rainfall particularly in the central western region cluster 6 similar to cluster 1 with moderate rainfall uniformly distributed over korea lightly peaking in the northern region the relationship of the meridional wind as displayed by the two first pcs with such rainfall patterns can be viewed in fig 7 which similarly to a composite analysis shows the temporal daily average of each pc across each cluster number it is clear that the lowest values of the first two pcs a weak meridional wind with reduced moisture transport are associated with low and moderate rainfall values clusters 3 2 and 1 as the meridional wind increases its value in both pcs the rainfall increases over the region but the peak region tends to be displaced from the south to the north as both pcs strengthen it is worth mentioning that the increase in both pcs is zonally asymmetric due to the pc loading patterns fig 5 with positive stronger winds in the east side and weaker eventually negative ones along the west side of the domain the above analysis is complemented by fig 8 which shows the scatter plot and the cross correlation function of the first two meridional wind pcs and the aggregate rainfall over korea the concurrent relation suggests as previously noted that positive pcs are associated with above normal rainfall peak rainfall tends to occur when the zonal dipole as represented by the second pc is at its largest strength the cross correlation function suggests that peak correlations occur when the first pc lags the rainfall for one day while for the second component it is concurrent fig 9 displays the autocorrelation function acf for both pcs and for the aggregate rainfall the first wind pc shows a moderate persistence with statistically significant correlations up to 7 days on the other hand the second wind pc is more variable and its autocorrelation sharply decreases after one day the autocorrelation of aggregate rainfall is low but still significant up to 7 days lag time it is worth mentioning that the acf is applied to the entire time series and its values could be slightly different in a seasonal analysis this analysis supports the inclusion of both pcs 1 and 2 and previous rainfall as predictors in a model for daily rainfall forecasts suggesting that it could improve its forecast skills eventually up to 7 days lead time 4 model specification inference and evaluation 4 1 a mixture of distributions for daily rainfall modelling the underlying model proposed here for daily rainfall forecasts is described in this section as a mixture of distributions which is a common approach e g gudmundsson et al 2012 when the probability distribution of the daily rainfall process has a discontinuity at zero dry days usually a bernoulli distribution is assumed for the occurrence of rainfall 0 dry day 1 wet day while a right skewed distribution such as a gamma or exponential distribution is fit to the subset of positive values of rainfall wet days mathematically for a given gauge i and day t we can express the distribution of rainfall y i t in two parts the first part is a bernoulli model for the binary event of rainfall occurrence where the probability of a wet day is given by 1 pr y i t tr π i t where π i t is the probability of rainfall for gauge i and day t to be greater than some threshold tr this probability can vary across time e g coe and stern 1982 and the threshold tr can be zero or slightly greater than zero conditional on the occurrence of rainfall y i t being greater than zero or some low threshold the second part assumes for convenience and simplicity a gamma distribution 2 y i t y i t 0 g α i t β i t where the α i t are the shape and β i t are the scale parameters of the gamma distribution note that both parameters can vary across stations and days or month seasons years etc the concept of generalized linear models glms see mccullagh and nelder 1989 for further details allows one to model the parameters in eqs 1 and 2 as linear functions f of covariates or predictors coe and stern 1982 stern and coe 1984 3 g π i t f x and 4 g μ i t f x where g is an appropriate link function x is a set of covariates time climate predictors past rainfall etc and μ it is the expected value of y it which in turn is related to both α it and β it through the relation 5 μ i t α i t β i t for the sake of simplicity let us assume that the probability of rainfall π it in eq 3 can be modelled as a linear function of two covariates and the amount of rainfall at some previous time t t τ and the canonical link function g is the logit 6 log π i t 1 π i t a 0 i a 1 i x 1 t a 2 i x 2 t a 3 i y i t where x x 1 t x 2 t y i t and x 1 t and x 2 t are exogenous covariates climate predictors and y i t is the previous amount of rainfall at time t t τ similarly to this model we assume a linear function g for the average rainfall in eq 4 and the log link function 7 log μ i t b 0 i b 1 i x 1 t b 2 i x 2 t b 3 i y i t which leads to 8 y i t y i t 0 g α i α i μ i t the maximum likelihood method is usually employed to estimate the parameters and since the seminal works of coe and stern 1982 and stern and coe 1984 a variety of applications and extensions have appeared in the literature we refer the reader to the works of wilks and wilby 1999 and chandler et al 2007 for a wider review of such methods in this paper we explore the estimation of the parameters in the governing equations through a hierarchical bayesian framework which is more appealing than ordinary methods in dealing with parameter uncertainties and sites with short records some examples of applications of bayesian models in hydrology appear in renard 2011 haddad et al 2012 viglione et al 2013 lima et al 2016 verdin et al 2019 and references therein 4 2 the hierarchical bayesian framework 4 2 1 a hierarchical bayesian model for the rainfall occurrence let us preliminarily assume that the rainfall gauges in a hydrologic homogeneous region should have similar coefficients a i a 0 i a 1 i a 2 i a 3 i except for some random variations this assumption can be accounted for in the model by shrinking the coefficients towards a common mean leading to so called partially pooled estimates gelman et al 2013 9 a ji n a j τ a j j 0 3 where n stands for the normal distribution with mean a j and precision 1 variance equals to τ a j it is interesting to note that the estimates for a given a ji will be a compromise between the estimate for a single gauge no pooling estimates and the average estimate across all gauges pooling estimates the use of a sufficiently large precision parameter implies that violations to the hydrologic homogeneity assumption does not compromise in any way the estimates as they would eventually lean towards the no pooling estimates in that case for hydrologic homogeneous regions this approach has two main advantages i the estimates a ji are more robust as more information is considered during the estimation process particularly for small sample size and ii the estimates a j are representatives of a common mean over the region which can be directly used for regionalization and estimates of parameters for ungauged sites as a side note we use the term precision rather than variance to align with the style employed in the software rjags plummer 2019 used here for bayesian estimation finally we need to define hyperprior distributions for the parameters in eq 9 since no information is known about these parameters we assume independent and weakly informative distributions for each parameter a j j 1 4 as done in other studies gelman 2006 lunn et al 2012 lima et al 2018 10 a j 1 for the purposes of simulation and easy convergence in the rjags software the distribution in eq 10 is coded as n 0 0 0 0001 as for the overall precision parameter τ a j 0 a common weakly informative conjugate prior distribution gelman 2006 lunn et al 2012 lima et al 2018 is adopted 11 τ a j g 0 001 0 001 j 0 3 where again the use of the gamma distribution here g with small parameter values is for convenience and to ease convergence in the rjags software 4 2 2 a hierarchical bayesian model for the rainfall amount the prior distributions for the parameters in eqs 7 and 8 will also assume a common mean across the domain 12 α i ln α τ α 13 b j i n b j τ b j j 0 3 where ln refers to the log normal distribution since we need the constraint α i 0 and τ α 0 and τ b j 0 are the precision parameters finally we also assume independent and weakly informative hyperprior distributions for the parameters in eqs 12 and 13 14 α n 0 0 0 0001 15 b j n 0 0 0 0001 j 0 3 16 τ α g 0 001 0 001 and 17 τ b j g 0 001 0 001 j 0 3 4 2 3 the full hierarchical bayesian model if we combine eqs 1 and 2 we can write the likelihood function l s θ where s is the observed data of daily rainfall for a specific period in time and θ represents the set of parameters as 18 l s θ i 1 n t 1 y i t tr t i 1 π i t i 1 n t 1 y i t tr t i π i t g y i t α i t β i t where n is the total number of rainfall gauges t i is the record length for gauge i and tr is the threshold to define a wet day combining the expressions for π i t and μ i t eqs 6 and 7 into 18 leads to the complete likelihood function 19 l

3 i y i t the analytical integration of eqs 23 and 24 with respect to the set of parameters θ is not straightforward and therefore we used the well known markov chain monte carlo mcmc method to sample from the posterior distribution of the set of parameters in 23 and 24 we coded all models in the r platform and used the associated packages sturtz et al 2005 wu et al 2015 plummer 2019 for the mcmc sampling scheme the standard code is freely provided as supplementary material the convergence of the posterior distributions was evaluated visually based on the mixture of 5 chains with 2 000 simulations each and based on the r coefficient as described in gelman et al 2013 due to the seasonal aspect of the rainfall we produce a set of parameters for each month of the calendar year and vary the lead time τ from 1 to 7 days resulting in a total of 12 7 84 batches of different posterior distributions for the parameter set θ to avoid numerical instabilities in the mcmc procedure for small values of rainfall we assumed a threshold tr of 1 00 mm 4 3 inference and evaluation of hyperparameters as previously described a mcmc simulation was used to estimate the posterior distribution of all parameter set the dataset was split into a training period 1979 2002 which was used to estimate the parameters and into an independent testing period 2003 2019 which was solely used to evaluate the model performance for illustrative purposes we limit the analysis of the hyperparameters for only january and july which are the driest and wettest months respectively fig 10 shows the posterior distribution of the hyperparameters a j and b j j 1 3 for january which is indicative of the general influence of the first two pcs and the persistence component in the forecast model as a function of the lead time τ of the forecast the coefficients of the first wind pc a 1 and b 1 indicate a steady decrease in its positive influence on the probability of rainfall occurrence and amount but in the latter up to 3 days of lead time averaging over the entire region the coefficients of the second wind pc a 2 and b 2 are mostly negative the persistence coefficients a 3 and b 3 which are related to the previous rainfall have a steady decline in terms of influence on the probability and amount of rainfall up to a three days lead time for july which is the peak rainfall month the posterior distributions of the hyperparameters show a more stable influence fig 11 the first wind pc coefficients a 1 and b 1 suggest a statistically significant influence up to 4 days for rainfall occurrence and 5 days for rainfall amount the second wind pc coefficients a 2 and b 2 are positive and statistically significant up to 7 days for rainfall occurrence and 3 days for rainfall amount as inferred from the autocorrelation function for the rainfall fig 9c the persistence components a 3 and b 3 are most substantial at one day lead time the posterior distributions of the precision hyperparameters τ a j and τ b j j 1 3 are displayed in the supplementary material the results suggest that for longer lead times the estimates go towards the pooled ones common mean with less variation across locations we also illustrate in the supplementary material the ability of the proposed model to simulate the density of observed rainfall data 5 results and discussion 5 1 skill metrics the proposed model was evaluated for the validation period 2003 2019 17 years and compared with two baseline models for rainfall occurrence model 1 the climatological relative frequency of rainy days based on the training period and model 2 an ordinary logistic regression having as predictor the previous rainfall amount which aims to evaluate the gain in accuracy by adding climate information for rainfall occurrence we used the standard brier skill score bss seewilks 2006 for further details which is defined as 25 bss 1 bs model bs ref where bs model and bs ref are respectively the brier score for the model under evaluation and for the baseline reference model given by 26 bs 1 n k 1 n y k o k 2 where the index k denotes a forecast event pair y is the forecast for the probability of rainfall and o is the observation 1 is a wet day 0 is a dry day note that bs is analogous to the mean squared error where a perfect forecast leads to bs 0 whereas less accurate forecasts have bs 0 consequently bss is bounded by the interval 1 and represents the improvement when bss 0 in the brier score over the baseline model as previously stated to avoid undesired noise among inference for very small amounts of rainfall we used a threshold of 1 mm to define the wet days o k 1 we noticed that the general conclusions of the work were not sensitive to small changes in this threshold as the models are fit to different months and lead times τ the brier skill score bss is a function of these two variables fig 12 displays the average bss across rainfall gauges as a function of the month and lead time when the proposed model is compared with the two baseline models in both cases the marginal gains over the baseline models are most significant up to a 3 days lead time being between 2 and 30 beyond a 4 days lead time the relative gains are below 2 and also less than zero for some months between october and june the highest skills are observed at τ 1 for the dry season months january may although bss is always greater than zero for the wettest months june september for baseline model 2 bss is also somewhat lower for τ 1 indicating a marginal gain over baseline model 1 after including the persistence i e previous rainfall as a predictor evaluation of the proposed model for rainfall amount forecasts is conducted based on the winkler skill score wss wilks 2006 which is defined by 27 wss 1 ws model ws ref where ws is the winkler s score and for a given observation of rainfall amount o is given by 28 ws b a 1 k a o o a b a 1 a o b b a 1 k o b o b where b and a are respectively the upper and lower boundaries of the probabilistic forecast interval and k is a penalty related to the width b a of the forecast interval given by k 1 f a where f a 1 f b is the cumulative probability associated with the lower boundary a here we focus on the 95 credible interval therefore k 1 0 025 40 ws ref is calculated based on the 95 prediction interval simulated from a monthly varying bernoulli gamma distribution fit to the daily rainfall data for a given rainfall gauge month and lead time τ the final wss is the average wss over the forecast values fig 13 displays the average wss across rainfall gauges as a function of the lead time τ and month up to 3 days lead time the proposed model is more preferable than the baseline model showing an average skill improvement up to 50 for τ 1 beyond τ 3 months there is a modest preference for the proposed model during the wet season months june october finally a general overview of the model skill can be attained via the correlation between observations and the predictive posterior median of the model forecasts note that in this case the uncertainty provided by the model is not taken into account fig 14 displays the average correlation skill across rainfall gauges as a function of the lead time τ and month values above 0 5 are observed for one day lead time while for up to 3 days lead time correlations vary from 0 5 up to 0 1 beyond a 3 days lead time the correlations are generally below 0 1 and can even lie between 0 05 and 0 the highest values are obtained for the dry season months december may 5 2 example of rainfall forecasts for illustrative purposes we show in figs 15 and 16 the predictive posterior distribution of forecasts for january at four randomly selected rainfall gauges for τ 1 and τ 3 days respectively for τ 1 day fig 15 the posterior mean blue line generally follows the temporal pattern for the observations for all gauges as evidenced by the relatively high correlation values the credible interval covers a large number of observations conversely for τ 3 days the temporal structure of the observations is mostly missed by the posterior mean and the credible intervals are now wider to better account for the larger uncertainty at this lead time most of the observations still fall within the credible interval illustrating the adequacy of the model despite the decrease in predictability as the lead time τ increases notably regarding the forecasts of most extreme rainfalls additionally the width of the credible interval increases as τ increases not shown here 6 conclusions we propose here a seasonal varying bernoulli gamma hierarchical bayesian model for daily rainfall forecasts which is generally based on well known weather generator models but with a rather different purpose the underlying scheme of the model allows for the inclusion of predictors in both distributions resulting in a logistic regression generalized linear model combination moreover the hierarchical bayesian framework promotes a better estimation of parameters particularly for rainfall gauges with short records the parameter uncertainties are better handled in such forecasts and the inclusion of hyperparameters further addresses the spatial variability issue and allows extension of the rainfall forecasts to ungauged sites the model was tested using daily rainfall data from 60 rainfall gauges located in the korean peninsula the predictors included in the model encompassed the previous observed rainfall and the first two principal components pcs of the meridional wind from the ncep ncar reanalysis data over the region which was chosen based on physical and empirical arguments related to rainfall in the region the data record was split into a training period 1979 2002 to estimate the model parameters and an independent testing set 2003 2019 to evaluate the model performance against reference models based on the climatology of key statistics of the data the meridional wind appears to have a large influence on moisture transport into the region and consequently on the daily rainfall amounts particularly for the wettest months june august contrary to previous rainfall which has a significant effect on only the one day lead time this influence seems to persist up to 4 days during the wettest months june august and is valid for both rainfall occurrence and amount for the probability of rainfall occurrence the overall improvement over the reference models based on the historical frequency of rainfall and a logistic regression with previous rainfall as a predictor is between 30 and 2 up to a 3 days lead time these numbers increase to 50 and 5 when the analysis is focused on forecasting rainfall amounts and compared with a reference model derived from an ordinary seasonal varying bernoulli gamma distribution fit to historical observations beyond a 3 days lead time the gains are marginal and the predictions tend to resemble the historical distributions for occurrence and amount but still justify use of the proposed model based on its superiority over the reference models in dealing with parameter estimates and uncertainties to the best of our knowledge this is the first approach in daily rainfall forecast models to use a weather generator model under a hierarchical bayesian framework while also including climate predictors the proposed model has limitations in that forecasts of the daily rainfall are still a challenge even with a one day lead time for instance although the bayesian framework used here along with climate predictors is an important basis to account for the spatial correlation across sites this aspect was not thoroughly investigated in the paper and will deserve attention in forthcoming work as compared with weather prediction models the inclusion of a few predictors in the proposed model limits its ability to capture other modes of variation of the climate dynamics that could be important for rainfall forecasts on the other hand the model structure provides a sound statistical framework to improve local rainfall forecasts offered by weather models daily rainfall forecasts could benefit from the strengths of both approaches by including weather model forecasts even ensemble forecasts as predictors in the proposed model in future work we will consider the application of the proposed model for operational forecasts where the predictors can be real time observations model based estimates of the low level wind field or weather model forecasts we also plan to conduct a complete test and upgrade the model for regional rainfall forecasts where locations without measurements could benefit from it credit authorship contribution

4466,we consider stochastic weather models originally developed for rainfall simulations to build a hierarchical bayesian mixture model for daily rainfall forecasts using endogenous and external information we model daily rainfall as a seasonal varying mixture of a bernoulli distribution for rainfall occurrence and a gamma distribution for the rainfall amount the model scheme allows the inclusion of predictors to reduce the bias and variance of the forecasts while the hierarchical bayesian framework promotes a better understanding and reduction in parameter uncertainties especially for gauges with short records as well as supports the estimation of regional parameters that could be employed for forecasts at ungauged sites the model was tested using 47 years 1973 2019 of daily rainfall data from 60 gauges in south korea climate indices derived from the low level wind over the region were analyzed using principal component analysis pca and embodied into the model to enhance its forecast skills the model structure was based on a detailed exploratory data analysis which included the application of self organizing maps som to examine the spatio temporal patterns of rainfall cross validated results reveal improved skills over reference models based on climatology and persistence up to a three days lead time the average gains in metrics such as the brier and winkler skill scores vary from 5 to 50 while the average correlation skill between predictions and observations reach values up to 0 55 the gains beyond a three days lead time are marginal but the underlying structure of the proposed model still encourages its use over the reference models being a step forward in improving real time daily rainfall forecasts for the region it has also a great potential to be combined with weather model forecasts and applied in other places across the world keywords daily rainfall forecasts hierarchical bayesian model climate information bernoulli gamma model 1 introduction the predictions of daily rainfall a few days out have many relevant applications for society it is of particular interest their use as forcing into hydrological bartholmes and todini 2005

systems e g the brasilian hydropower system seecollischonn et al 2007 to provide such information a variety of global and regional weather models have developed along the years mcbride and ebert 2000 lin et al 2005 mittermaier 2007 luitel et al 2018 as they intend to simulate a large number of variables by numerically solving the governing physical equations of the complex and non linear climate system they need to rely on parametrizations e g cloud parametrization spatio temporal discretizations of the physical domain and active knowledge of initial conditions that inevitably lead to uncertainties in model formulation which is generally addressed by ensemble forecasts and their statistical post processing e g vannitsem et al 2018 as they provide forecasts for a grid cell it is always a challenge to compare and evaluate the ensemble forecasts accuracy with point based observations in gauge stations as a result daily rainfall forecasts directly provided by weather models may contain a large bias and variance vidale et al 2003 ebert et al 2003 accadia et al 2005 bürger 2009 cuo et al 2011 shrestha et al 2013 baxter et al 2014 wang 2015 sharma et al 2017 xu et al 2018

even rainfall predictions from weather models could be included in the empirical models to improve the forecast skills particularly at seasonal scales e g sharma 2000 singhrattna et al 2005 the large majority of statistical models for rainfall predictions however have most often being applied for rainfall simulations which are conceptually different from rainfall forecasts the former is the quantitative reproduction of the behavior of a system given some defined inputs but without reference to any observed outputs while forecasting is the quantitative reproduction of the behavior of a system ahead of time but given observations of the inputs state variables where applicable and outputs up to the present time the forecasting origin beven and young 2013 perhaps the most common rainfall models for simulation are the so called stochastic weather generator models richardson 1981 wilks and wilby 1999 rasmussen 2013 mehrotra et al 2015 gao et al 2018 vallam and qin 2016 diez sierra and del jesus 2017 verdin et al 2018 oriani et al 2018 verdin et al 2019 which attempt to simulate daily rainfall sequences while preserving important statistics observed in historical records the first generators however often failed to simulate key aspects of daily rainfall including dry spells extremes marginal distributions correlation structure statistical properties across scales and

preserve the marginal distribution and the correlation structure papalexiou 2018 papalexiou et al 2018 papalexiou and serinaldi 2020 more recently a large number of applications of weather generator models are towards statistical downscaling of weather model forecasts and climate change projections bellone et al 2000 bürger 2009 wilks 2010 mehrotra and sharma 2010 mehrotra et al 2013 langousis

et al 2020 for daily rainfall simulations herein we propose a statistical forecast model that relies on the concepts of stochastic weather generator models and includes endogenous past rainfall and exogenous large scale climate information predictors the inference is carried out in a hierarchical bayesian framework which drives better estimates of model parameters and a more proper assessment of the parameter uncertainties of rainfall forecasts as generator models for daily rainfall simulation usually comprise a mixture of distributions one for the rainfall occurrence e g bernoulli and one for the rainfall amount e g log normal or gamma the proposed model consists of a bernoulli gamma mixture of distributions for rainfall occurrence and amount where predictors can be included in both distributions leading to a nonstationary model some recent studies indicate that a heavy tailed distribution is in general more appropriate for the rainfall amounts wilson and toumi 2005 papalexiou et al 2013 cavanaugh et al 2015 langousis et al 2016b nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 papalexiou et al 2018 rajulapati et al 2020 we offer here a nonstationary gamma model for the rainfall amounts which can be viewed as a mixture of gamma distributions where the time varying parameters will reflect the changes in the proportions of the mixture it is very unlikely that daily rainfall from typical events comes from the same process e g convective frontal tropical storms etc or distribution as the extremes so a mixture or similar is conceptually and theoretically warranted we show in the supplementary material that a mixture of gamma distributions is able to simulate highly skewed data and the empirical density of observed daily rainfall data the choice of the gamma distribution for the mixture is also for convenience as it is perhaps the most used distribution in such applications it does not imply however that the use of other nonstationary distributions in our model could lead to better results in specific cases we expect that the addition of predictors will lead to conditional independence across rainfall sites so that the spatial correlations across them are likely preserved in the forecasts the model is structured in a way that not only improves the accuracy of the forecasts compared with reference models based on climatologies but also allows a smooth transition with respect to the lead times of the forecasts between the usefulness of including predictors and thus acting as a forecast model and using solely the historical information acting more as a simulation model such scheme does not require a model selection procedure over the forecast time horizon the proposed model is evaluated using 47 years 1973 2019 of historical data from 60 rainfall gauges located in south korea forecasts or hindcastings using the concept proposed in beven and young 2013 utilizing up to 7 days lead times and an independent testing period are used for cross validation to compare standard forecast skill metrics with those from reference models based on climatology the previous rainfall and low level wind field provided by reanalysis data are used as predictors after this introduction this study is organized as follows the climate data are presented in section 2 an exploratory data analysis of the rainfall data and their relations with the wind field data including the application of principal component analysis pca and self organizing maps som is presented in section 3 the methodology describing the proposed hierarchical bayesian model for daily rainfall forecasts its inference and evaluation are offered in section 4 the outcomes of the proposed forecasting model which includes the evaluation of forecast skill metrics is illustrated in section 5 finally in section 6 we offer a summary and the main conclusions of this paper 2 rainfall and climate information data daily rainfall series from 60 rainfall gauges located in korea fig 1 are used to evaluate the proposed model the rainfall data are provided by the automatic synoptic observation system asos operated from the korean meteorological administration kma and cover the 1973 2019 historical period the daily wind field data for the period 1973 2019 are provided by the ncep ncar reanalysis project kalnay et al 1996 and are available at the website https iridl ldeo columbia edu sources noaa ncep ncar cdas 1 we focus on the low level wind averaged over the 1000 925 850 700 mb pressure levels the wind field is extracted over the domain 120 w 134 w longitude and 30 n 42 n latitude which covers the entire korean peninsula resulting in 30 grid points of data an exploratory analysis of the rainfall and wind field data is presented in the next section 3 exploratory data analysis 3 1 analysis of rainfall over south korea a general view of the seasonal pattern of total daily rainfall over korea is shown in fig 2 the peak occurs in july and is associated with the summer season in the region during this time there is a strong tropical moisture export from the yellow sea and east china sea fig 3 b the meridional wind is predominantly positive i e from south to north conversely the lowest rainfall takes place in january during the winter season whereas the wind field is generally from the asian continent fig 3a resulting in poor moisture transport the meridional wind is mostly negative i e from north to south in this case it is worth mentioning that the zonal wind remains positive from west to east during both months 3 2 the influence of the wind field over the rainfall in south korea fig 4 shows the distribution of the spatial average over the domain shown in fig 3 meridional wind for the year it is interesting to note that incursion retreat of low level moisture from the yellow and east china seas can also occur during the winter summer period as positive negative values can occur during these times suggesting a highly variable wind and the occurrence of rainfall episodes during the dry season likewise dry spells are also likely to occur during the wet season the variability of the meridional wind is further evaluated by applying principal component analysis pca seewilks 2006 for further details to the data fig 5 displays the loadings of the two main modes of variability which account for roughly 84 of the data variance 63 first pc 21 of second pc the main mode has a common pattern of variation resembling a spatial average across the grid the second mode has a zonal seesaw kind of pattern with the center crossing the korean peninsula the third component corresponds to only 6 of the data variance and is not shown here the temporal components of the first two pcs are showed in the supplementary material a preliminary attempt to investigate the influence of meridional wind on the spatio temporal variability of the daily rainfall over korea is conducted by applying self organizing map som to the daily rainfall data soms is a clustering technique based on artificial neural networks that has found many applications in hydrology and climate sciences the underlying methodology makes it very appropriate for large datasets which is our case here we refer the reader to cavazos 2000 kohonen 2001 li et al 2015 lima et al 2017 and the references therein for further details examples and explanation about soms we employed the kohonen package available for the r software wehrens and buydens 2007 wehrens and kruisselbrink 2018 we applied then som to the entire daily rainfall sequence in order to obtain different clusters that could reveal spatio temporal patterns of daily rainfall over korea for each day of the historical record som produces a cluster index the total number of clusters i e number of nodes is a tune parameter of som and we set it as six arranged and connected in a hexagonal grid after visually evaluating the rainfall patterns that emerge from changing the total number of clusters these patterns are evaluated by a composite analysis for each rainfall gauge we estimate its composite mean over time for each cluster index the final result is a spatio temporal picture of daily rainfall over korea for each cluster index fig 6 displays the six clusters obtained after applying som to the rainfall dataset we observe the following features for each cluster cluster 1 moderate rainfall uniformly distributed over korea marginally peaking in the southern part of the region cluster 2 low rainfall uniformly distributed over korea cluster 3 no or very little occurrence of rainfall over the entire korea cluster 4 high rainfall particularly in the southern region cluster 5 high rainfall particularly in the central western region cluster 6 similar to cluster 1 with moderate rainfall uniformly distributed over korea lightly peaking in the northern region the relationship of the meridional wind as displayed by the two first pcs with such rainfall patterns can be viewed in fig 7 which similarly to a composite analysis shows the temporal daily average of each pc across each cluster number it is clear that the lowest values of the first two pcs a weak meridional wind with reduced moisture transport are associated with low and moderate rainfall values clusters 3 2 and 1 as the meridional wind increases its value in both pcs the rainfall increases over the region but the peak region tends to be displaced from the south to the north as both pcs strengthen it is worth mentioning that the increase in both pcs is zonally asymmetric due to the pc loading patterns fig 5 with positive stronger winds in the east side and weaker eventually negative ones along the west side of the domain the above analysis is complemented by fig 8 which shows the scatter plot and the cross correlation function of the first two meridional wind pcs and the aggregate rainfall over korea the concurrent relation suggests as previously noted that positive pcs are associated with above normal rainfall peak rainfall tends to occur when the zonal dipole as represented by the second pc is at its largest strength the cross correlation function suggests that peak correlations occur when the first pc lags the rainfall for one day while for the second component it is concurrent fig 9 displays the autocorrelation function acf for both pcs and for the aggregate rainfall the first wind pc shows a moderate persistence with statistically significant correlations up to 7 days on the other hand the second wind pc is more variable and its autocorrelation sharply decreases after one day the autocorrelation of aggregate rainfall is low but still significant up to 7 days lag time it is worth mentioning that the acf is applied to the entire time series and its values could be slightly different in a seasonal analysis this analysis supports the inclusion of both pcs 1 and 2 and previous rainfall as predictors in a model for daily rainfall forecasts suggesting that it could improve its forecast skills eventually up to 7 days lead time 4 model specification inference and evaluation 4 1 a mixture of distributions for daily rainfall modelling the underlying model proposed here for daily rainfall forecasts is described in this section as a mixture of distributions which is a common approach e g gudmundsson et al 2012 when the probability distribution of the daily rainfall process has a discontinuity at zero dry days usually a bernoulli distribution is assumed for the occurrence of rainfall 0 dry day 1 wet day while a right skewed distribution such as a gamma or exponential distribution is fit to the subset of positive values of rainfall wet days mathematically for a given gauge i and day t we can express the distribution of rainfall y i t in two parts the first part is a bernoulli model for the binary event of rainfall occurrence where the probability of a wet day is given by 1 pr y i t tr π i t where π i t is the probability of rainfall for gauge i and day t to be greater than some threshold tr this probability can vary across time e g coe and stern 1982 and the threshold tr can be zero or slightly greater than zero conditional on the occurrence of rainfall y i t being greater than zero or some low threshold the second part assumes for convenience and simplicity a gamma distribution 2 y i t y i t 0 g α i t β i t where the α i t are the shape and β i t are the scale parameters of the gamma distribution note that both parameters can vary across stations and days or month seasons years etc the concept of generalized linear models glms see mccullagh and nelder 1989 for further details allows one to model the parameters in eqs 1 and 2 as linear functions f of covariates or predictors coe and stern 1982 stern and coe 1984 3 g π i t f x and 4 g μ i t f x where g is an appropriate link function x is a set of covariates time climate predictors past rainfall etc and μ it is the expected value of y it which in turn is related to both α it and β it through the relation 5 μ i t α i t β i t for the sake of simplicity let us assume that the probability of rainfall π it in eq 3 can be modelled as a linear function of two covariates and the amount of rainfall at some previous time t t τ and the canonical link function g is the logit 6 log π i t 1 π i t a 0 i a 1 i x 1 t a 2 i x 2 t a 3 i y i t where x x 1 t x 2 t y i t and x 1 t and x 2 t are exogenous covariates climate predictors and y i t is the previous amount of rainfall at time t t τ similarly to this model we assume a linear function g for the average rainfall in eq 4 and the log link function 7 log μ i t b 0 i b 1 i x 1 t b 2 i x 2 t b 3 i y i t which leads to 8 y i t y i t 0 g α i α i μ i t the maximum likelihood method is usually employed to estimate the parameters and since the seminal works of coe and stern 1982 and stern and coe 1984 a variety of applications and extensions have appeared in the literature we refer the reader to the works of wilks and wilby 1999 and chandler et al 2007 for a wider review of such methods in this paper we explore the estimation of the parameters in the governing equations through a hierarchical bayesian framework which is more appealing than ordinary methods in dealing with parameter uncertainties and sites with short records some examples of applications of bayesian models in hydrology appear in renard 2011 haddad et al 2012 viglione et al 2013 lima et al 2016 verdin et al 2019 and references therein 4 2 the hierarchical bayesian framework 4 2 1 a hierarchical bayesian model for the rainfall occurrence let us preliminarily assume that the rainfall gauges in a hydrologic homogeneous region should have similar coefficients a i a 0 i a 1 i a 2 i a 3 i except for some random variations this assumption can be accounted for in the model by shrinking the coefficients towards a common mean leading to so called partially pooled estimates gelman et al 2013 9 a ji n a j τ a j j 0 3 where n stands for the normal distribution with mean a j and precision 1 variance equals to τ a j it is interesting to note that the estimates for a given a ji will be a compromise between the estimate for a single gauge no pooling estimates and the average estimate across all gauges pooling estimates the use of a sufficiently large precision parameter implies that violations to the hydrologic homogeneity assumption does not compromise in any way the estimates as they would eventually lean towards the no pooling estimates in that case for hydrologic homogeneous regions this approach has two main advantages i the estimates a ji are more robust as more information is considered during the estimation process particularly for small sample size and ii the estimates a j are representatives of a common mean over the region which can be directly used for regionalization and estimates of parameters for ungauged sites as a side note we use the term precision rather than variance to align with the style employed in the software rjags plummer 2019 used here for bayesian estimation finally we need to define hyperprior distributions for the parameters in eq 9 since no information is known about these parameters we assume independent and weakly informative distributions for each parameter a j j 1 4 as done in other studies gelman 2006 lunn et al 2012 lima et al 2018 10 a j 1 for the purposes of simulation and easy convergence in the rjags software the distribution in eq 10 is coded as n 0 0 0 0001 as for the overall precision parameter τ a j 0 a common weakly informative conjugate prior distribution gelman 2006 lunn et al 2012 lima et al 2018 is adopted 11 τ a j g 0 001 0 001 j 0 3 where again the use of the gamma distribution here g with small parameter values is for convenience and to ease convergence in the rjags software 4 2 2 a hierarchical bayesian model for the rainfall amount the prior distributions for the parameters in eqs 7 and 8 will also assume a common mean across the domain 12 α i ln α τ α 13 b j i n b j τ b j j 0 3 where ln refers to the log normal distribution since we need the constraint α i 0 and τ α 0 and τ b j 0 are the precision parameters finally we also assume independent and weakly informative hyperprior distributions for the parameters in eqs 12 and 13 14 α n 0 0 0 0001 15 b j n 0 0 0 0001 j 0 3 16 τ α g 0 001 0 001 and 17 τ b j g 0 001 0 001 j 0 3 4 2 3 the full hierarchical bayesian model if we combine eqs 1 and 2 we can write the likelihood function l s θ where s is the observed data of daily rainfall for a specific period in time and θ represents the set of parameters as 18 l s θ i 1 n t 1 y i t tr t i 1 π i t i 1 n t 1 y i t tr t i π i t g y i t α i t β i t where n is the total number of rainfall gauges t i is the record length for gauge i and tr is the threshold to define a wet day combining the expressions for π i t and μ i t eqs 6 and 7 into 18 leads to the complete likelihood function 19 l s θ i 1 n t 1 y i t tr t i 1 1 e a 0 i a 1 i x 1 t a 2 i x 2 t a 3 i y i t i 1 n t 1 y i t tr t i 1 1 e a 0 i a 1 i x 1 t a 2 i x 2 t a 3 i y i t g y i t α i t α i t e b 0 i b 1 i x 1 t b 2 i x 2 t b 3 i y i t the likelihood function 19 can be factorized into two terms one involving only the model parameters for the rainfall occurrence model 20 l 1 s θ i 1 n t 1 y i t tr t i 1 1 e a 0 i a 1 i x 1

3 i y i t the analytical integration of eqs 23 and 24 with respect to the set of parameters θ is not straightforward and therefore we used the well known markov chain monte carlo mcmc method to sample from the posterior distribution of the set of parameters in 23 and 24 we coded all models in the r platform and used the associated packages sturtz et al 2005 wu et al 2015 plummer 2019 for the mcmc sampling scheme the standard code is freely provided as supplementary material the convergence of the posterior distributions was evaluated visually based on the mixture of 5 chains with 2 000 simulations each and based on the r coefficient as described in gelman et al 2013 due to the seasonal aspect of the rainfall we produce a set of parameters for each month of the calendar year and vary the lead time τ from 1 to 7 days resulting in a total of 12 7 84 batches of different posterior distributions for the parameter set θ to avoid numerical instabilities in the mcmc procedure for small values of rainfall we assumed a threshold tr of 1 00 mm 4 3 inference and evaluation of hyperparameters as previously described a mcmc simulation was used to estimate the posterior distribution of all parameter set the dataset was split into a training period 1979 2002 which was used to estimate the parameters and into an independent testing period 2003 2019 which was solely used to evaluate the model performance for illustrative purposes we limit the analysis of the hyperparameters for only january and july which are the driest and wettest months respectively fig 10 shows the posterior distribution of the hyperparameters a j and b j j 1 3 for january which is indicative of the general influence of the first two pcs and the persistence component in the forecast model as a function of the lead time τ of the forecast the coefficients of the first wind pc a 1 and b 1 indicate a steady decrease in its positive influence on the probability of rainfall occurrence and amount but in the latter up to 3 days of lead time averaging over the entire region the coefficients of the second wind pc a 2 and b 2 are mostly negative the persistence coefficients a 3 and b 3 which are related to the previous rainfall have a steady decline in terms of influence on the probability and amount of rainfall up to a three days lead time for july which is the peak rainfall month the posterior distributions of the hyperparameters show a more stable influence fig 11 the first wind pc coefficients a 1 and b 1 suggest a statistically significant influence up to 4 days for rainfall occurrence and 5 days for rainfall amount the second wind pc coefficients a 2 and b 2 are positive and statistically significant up to 7 days for rainfall occurrence and 3 days for rainfall amount as inferred from the autocorrelation function for the rainfall fig 9c the persistence components a 3 and b 3 are most substantial at one day lead time the posterior distributions of the precision hyperparameters τ a j and τ b j j 1 3 are displayed in the supplementary material the results suggest that for longer lead times the estimates go towards the pooled ones common mean with less variation across locations we also illustrate in the supplementary material the ability of the proposed model to simulate the density of observed rainfall data 5 results and discussion 5 1 skill metrics the proposed model was evaluated for the validation period 2003 2019 17 years and compared with two baseline models for rainfall occurrence model 1 the climatological relative frequency of rainy days based on the training period and model 2 an ordinary logistic regression having as predictor the previous rainfall amount which aims to evaluate the gain in accuracy by adding climate information for rainfall occurrence we used the standard brier skill score bss seewilks 2006 for further details which is defined as 25 bss 1 bs model bs ref where bs model and bs ref are respectively the brier score for the model under evaluation and for the baseline reference model given by 26 bs 1 n k 1 n y k o k 2 where the index k denotes a forecast event pair y is the forecast for the probability of rainfall and o is the observation 1 is a wet day 0 is a dry day note that bs is analogous to the mean squared error where a perfect forecast leads to bs 0 whereas less accurate forecasts have bs 0 consequently bss is bounded by the interval 1 and represents the improvement when bss 0 in the brier score over the baseline model as previously stated to avoid undesired noise among inference for very small amounts of rainfall we used a threshold of 1 mm to define the wet days o k 1 we noticed that the general conclusions of the work were not sensitive to small changes in this threshold as the models are fit to different months and lead times τ the brier skill score bss is a function of these two variables fig 12 displays the average bss across rainfall gauges as a function of the month and lead time when the proposed model is compared with the two baseline models in both cases the marginal gains over the baseline models are most significant up to a 3 days lead time being between 2 and 30 beyond a 4 days lead time the relative gains are below 2 and also less than zero for some months between october and june the highest skills are observed at τ 1 for the dry season months january may although bss is always greater than zero for the wettest months june september for baseline model 2 bss is also somewhat lower for τ 1 indicating a marginal gain over baseline model 1 after including the persistence i e previous rainfall as a predictor evaluation of the proposed model for rainfall amount forecasts is conducted based on the winkler skill score wss wilks 2006 which is defined by 27 wss 1 ws model ws ref where ws is the winkler s score and for a given observation of rainfall amount o is given by 28 ws b a 1 k a o o a b a 1 a o b b a 1 k o b o b where b and a are respectively the upper and lower boundaries of the probabilistic forecast interval and k is a penalty related to the width b a of the forecast interval given by k 1 f a where f a 1 f b is the cumulative probability associated with the lower boundary a here we focus on the 95 credible interval therefore k 1 0 025 40 ws ref is calculated based on the 95 prediction interval simulated from a monthly varying bernoulli gamma distribution fit to the daily rainfall data for a given rainfall gauge month and lead time τ the final wss is the average wss over the forecast values fig 13 displays the average wss across rainfall gauges as a function of the lead time τ and month up to 3 days lead time the proposed model is more preferable than the baseline model showing an average skill improvement up to 50 for τ 1 beyond τ 3 months there is a modest preference for the proposed model during the wet season months june october finally a general overview of the model skill can be attained via the correlation between observations and the predictive posterior median of the model forecasts note that in this case the uncertainty provided by the model is not taken into account fig 14 displays the average correlation skill across rainfall gauges as a function of the lead time τ and month values above 0 5 are observed for one day lead time while for up to 3 days lead time correlations vary from 0 5 up to 0 1 beyond a 3 days lead time the correlations are generally below 0 1 and can even lie between 0 05 and 0 the highest values are obtained for the dry season months december may 5 2 example of rainfall forecasts for illustrative purposes we show in figs 15 and 16 the predictive posterior distribution of forecasts for january at four randomly selected rainfall gauges for τ 1 and τ 3 days respectively for τ 1 day fig 15 the posterior mean blue line generally follows the temporal pattern for the observations for all gauges as evidenced by the relatively high correlation values the credible interval covers a large number of observations conversely for τ 3 days the temporal structure of the observations is mostly missed by the posterior mean and the credible intervals are now wider to better account for the larger uncertainty at this lead time most of the observations still fall within the credible interval illustrating the adequacy of the model despite the decrease in predictability as the lead time τ increases notably regarding the forecasts of most extreme rainfalls additionally the width of the credible interval increases as τ increases not shown here 6 conclusions we propose here a seasonal varying bernoulli gamma hierarchical bayesian model for daily rainfall forecasts which is generally based on well known weather generator models but with a rather different purpose the underlying scheme of the model allows for the inclusion of predictors in both distributions resulting in a logistic regression generalized linear model combination moreover the hierarchical bayesian framework promotes a better estimation of parameters particularly for rainfall gauges with short records the parameter uncertainties are better handled in such forecasts and the inclusion of hyperparameters further addresses the spatial variability issue and allows extension of the rainfall forecasts to ungauged sites the model was tested using daily rainfall data from 60 rainfall gauges located in the korean peninsula the predictors included in the model encompassed the previous observed rainfall and the first two principal components pcs of the meridional wind from the ncep ncar reanalysis data over the region which was chosen based on physical and empirical arguments related to rainfall in the region the data record was split into a training period 1979 2002 to estimate the model parameters and an independent testing set 2003 2019 to evaluate the model performance against reference models based on the climatology of key statistics of the data the meridional wind appears to have a large influence on moisture transport into the region and consequently on the daily rainfall amounts particularly for the wettest months june august contrary to previous rainfall which has a significant effect on only the one day lead time this influence seems to persist up to 4 days during the wettest months june august and is valid for both rainfall occurrence and amount for the probability of rainfall occurrence the overall improvement over the reference models based on the historical frequency of rainfall and a logistic regression with previous rainfall as a predictor is between 30 and 2 up to a 3 days lead time these numbers increase to 50 and 5 when the analysis is focused on forecasting rainfall amounts and compared with a reference model derived from an ordinary seasonal varying bernoulli gamma distribution fit to historical observations beyond a 3 days lead time the gains are marginal and the predictions tend to resemble the historical distributions for occurrence and amount but still justify use of the proposed model based on its superiority over the reference models in dealing with parameter estimates and uncertainties to the best of our knowledge this is the first approach in daily rainfall forecast models to use a weather generator model under a hierarchical bayesian framework while also including climate predictors the proposed model has limitations in that forecasts of the daily rainfall are still a challenge even with a one day lead time for instance although the bayesian framework used here along with climate predictors is an important basis to account for the spatial correlation across sites this aspect was not thoroughly investigated in the paper and will deserve attention in forthcoming work as compared with weather prediction models the inclusion of a few predictors in the proposed model limits its ability to capture other modes of variation of the climate dynamics that could be important for rainfall forecasts on the other hand the model structure provides a sound statistical framework to improve local rainfall forecasts offered by weather models daily rainfall forecasts could benefit from the strengths of both approaches by including weather model forecasts even ensemble forecasts as predictors in the proposed model in future work we will consider the application of the proposed model for operational forecasts where the predictors can be real time observations model based estimates of the low level wind field or weather model forecasts we also plan to conduct a complete test and upgrade the model for regional rainfall forecasts where locations without measurements could benefit from it credit authorship contribution

4467,urban rainstorm floods have become one of the most significant natural disasters that restrict the healthy development of the economy and society it is imperative to reduce the risk of urban rainstorm flood disasters which is growing along with urbanization during the process of urban planning and construction however because of the complexity of urban elements it is quite difficult to identify sensitive indicators of urban rainstorm flood disasters to provide effective guidance on flood control in this study the composition of urban elements was systematically proposed based on descriptive framework for cities and communities including natural structural and social elements and then a specific indicator system was established furthermore random forest model was used to determine the relative importance of the indicators that are closely related to the direct economic loss that reflects the severity of urban rainstorm flood disasters considering four cities in china beijing tianjin chongqing and shanghai with different topographical and hydrological conditions as examples the sensitivity indicators of urban rainstorm flood disasters were identified and the results were verified based on the catastrophe evaluation method the results indicate that urban rainstorm flood disasters are the most sensitive to surface water resources and are the least sensitive to relief degree of land surface finally specific measures to mitigate urban rainstorm flood disasters were proposed keywords urban flood urban element random forest economic loss relative importance 1 introduction because of anthropogenic activities and climate change daksiya et al 2021 li and sivapalan 2020 urban rainstorm flood disasters have gradually become one of the most significant risks to human survival and social development aerts et al 2014 according to the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china more than 100 cities in china suffered from urban floods every year from 2008 to 2018 causing direct economic losses of 374 5 267 5 315 6 and 364 3 billion yuan in 2010 2012 2013 and 2016 respectively therefore urban rainstorm flood disasters have become a crucial problem that restricts the sustainable and healthy development of china s economy and society yin et al 2015 zheng et al 2016 urban flood management has become a popular research topic including drainage hellmers et al 2017 rainstorm flood forecasting and early warning yan et al 2018 storm water management and utilization schaer et al 2018 and flood risk analysis mcclean et al 2020 andersen et al 2013 demonstrated that topographic and anthropogenic influences exacerbate or reduce flood risks by altering the surface runoff infiltration storage and precipitation development yu and coulthard 2015 revealed the effects of catchment hydrological parameters on urban floods chang and huang 2015 found that land use and land cover changes have contributed to an increase in urban flooding tian et al 2019 derived critical thresholds beyond which urban pluvial flooding is likely to occur based on a decadal dataset of radar rainfall maps thanvisitthpon 2019 investigated the impact of land use transformation and anti flood structural infrastructure on flooding in four flood prone districts in thailand anni et al 2020 analyzed the role of stormwater infrastructure and soil infiltration in urban floods furthermore in addition to rainfall and the underlying surface urban planning and management have a significant impact on urban flooding zhou et al 2019 löwe et al 2017 proved that urban planning policies are an efficient means for urban flood reduction rezende et al 2019 used socio economic indices to analyze urban flood resilience li and sivapalan 2020 analyzed the substantial role of human actions in urban floods and urban water systems these studies revealed the impacts of some factors on urban floods to a certain extent through the analysis of the physical mechanism of urban flooding however these studies are inadequate for complex urban systems because of their overreliance on simplistic methods at large scales saksena et al 2020 with the characteristics of a highly concentrated population and facilities complex spatial structure high speed dynamic operations and evolution urban areas are complex and vast systems coupled with nature and humanity which is distinct from any other natural system li and willems 2020 this system consists of mutual relationships and interactions among various elements including not only natural elements and structural elements such as topography and underlying surface but also social elements such as government intervention and economic effects urban flood response has striking spatial heterogeneities in peak flood magnitudes response times and runoff ratios which are primarily linked to the watershed scale distribution of impervious cover and storm water management zhou et al 2019 therefore to identify the sensitivity indicators of urban rainstorm flood disasters it is necessary to comprehensively analyze the related urban elements urban elements cause urban flooding and economic losses when combined with rainstorms attracting the attention of society ge et al 2020 bermúdez and zischg 2019 explored the sensitivity of flood loss estimates to the spatial representation of buildings and hazard attribution methods grantham et al 2019 described a set of climate informed ecological resilience principles and the associated indicators to guide climate adaptive water resource management lee and brody 2019 verified that a high density development of compact designs decreases flood loss even though urban built up land with higher impervious surfaces may cause more flood damage waghwala and agnihotri 2019 stressed that the lack of flood management in urban areas led to increasing flood losses in urban sprawl pinos et al 2020 estimated the direct damage caused by urban floods with different return periods based on a univariable deterministic flood loss model mei et al 2020 found that both rainfall intensity and rainfall patterns are the determining factors of urban flooding despite the increase in flood hazards and exposure information accuracy the estimation of losses is a poorly understood component of pluvial flood risk quantification rözer et al 2019 however with the increase in flood loss data and the rapid development of big data technology that explores information quickly and easily ge et al 2021 the identification of sensitivity indicators of urban rainstorm flood disasters can be realized based on the actual loss providing new ideas for urban flood disaster management machine learning algorithms are increasingly being used in natural disaster risk assessments li et al 2019 used four machine learning algorithms to identify flood sensitivity indicators and assessed the risk in river basins involving thirteen indicators the results indicated that random forest rf performed the best in the test and could be used as an effective and reliable tool in flood sensitivity assessments hence this study established an indicator system for urban rainstorm flooding based on an urban element analysis and determined the relative importance of the indicators based on the rf algorithm to identify the urban rainstorm flood disaster sensitive indicators providing a reference for urban construction planning and disaster control 2 materials and methods 2 1 study areas the study focuses on four municipalities that are directly under the central government of china that is beijing tianjin chongqing and shanghai which play vital roles in the politics economy culture tourism and other aspects of the country the four cities have varying topographical and hydrological conditions the capital city beijing is located in northern china tianjin close to beijing is the largest port city in northern china chongqing is the largest industrial and commercial city in southwest china shanghai is the economic financial and cultural center and located in east china the geographical conditions of the four cities are shown in fig 1 by the end of 2017 the urbanization rates of beijing tianjin and shanghai exceeded 80 and the urbanization rate of chongqing increased from 48 10 to 64 08 from 2006 to 2017 in this study data regarding the urban elements and the direct economic losses due to flooding for beijing tianjin and chongqing from 2006 to 2017 were used as the sample data while those for shanghai 2012 2017 were used as the validation data from 2006 to 2017 the proportions of the years that beijing tianjin chongqing and shanghai experienced direct losses due to urban flood were 75 58 83 and 75 respectively as shown in fig 2 2 2 urban rainstorm flood disaster system analysis urban rainstorm flood disasters are typical natural disasters that are affected by traditional hydrological factors and anthropogenic factors such as land use population and wealth accumulation resulting from urbanization the process of urban rainstorm flood disasters follows the chain development of natural disaster systems wu et al 2020b the rain falls into the urban system and continuously produces surface confluence from the interaction between the topography and the underlying surface when the surface confluence exceeds the urban drainage capacity urban flooding occurs and may cause an economic loss the formation process of the disaster chain system divides the variables into input variables state variables and output variables as a disaster causing factor rainfall is an input variable a state variable is the state of the participating factors that form the urban flood disaster that is the state of the urban flood and the related urban elements intuitively the output variable is the disaster loss the mode of the urban rainstorm flood disaster chain is shown in fig 3 according to fig 3 the state of urban flooding is formed by the interaction between the rainfall and urban elements related to urban flooding as shown in eq 1 1 f r u where f is the urban flood state and r and u are the states of the rainfall and urban elements related to urban flooding respectively the loss due to urban rainstorm flood disasters is caused by urban flooding and urban elements as shown in eq 2 2 l f u where l is the urban flood disaster loss hence the loss due to urban rainstorm flood disasters is directly determined by the rainfall and the states of the urban elements as shown in eq 3 3 l r u 2 3 urban elements analysis in response to the needs of the united nations un world bank organization for economic co operation and development oecd and other international organizations and countries for urban sustainable development standards the sustainable cities and communities of the international organization for standardization 2019 established the standard of the descriptive framework for cities and communities iso dis 317105 which uses the analogy between the human anatomy and dynamic physiology to describe cities also known as the urban anatomy this standard outlines that the city can be understood as an ecosystem which can be divided into three parts the living entity in the ecosystem the physical structure and the interaction between the two lin and xia 2013 the living entity refers to human beings and the physical structure refers to the composition of physical factors that ensure all the human activities in the city which is manifested as the physical structure of the city the interaction between them is manifested mainly as social elements including life work education economy culture and information hence the urban system structure can be determined as shown in fig 4 urban rainstorm flood disasters result from the interaction between rainfall and the elements of the urban system structure rainfall is also a natural factor that can be attributed to the natural elements of urban floods hence the types of urban elements associated with urban rainstorm flood disasters can be determined which are divided into natural elements structural elements and social elements as shown in fig 5 according to fig 5 the indicators used to characterize the urban system elements related to urban rainstorm disasters can be determined 2 3 1 natural elements according to the urban system structure natural elements are the constituent elements of the natural environment urban anatomy defines the natural environment as a natural system composed of water earth and air which supports the formation and development of cities international organization for standardization 2019 therefore natural elements include rainfall surface water resources and topography because floods occur more frequently during the warm seasons amann et al 2015 for example from june to september in china the accumulated rainfall during the flood season arfs was adopted to indicate the urban rainfall conditions surface water resources swrs are the urban surface water resources the relief degree of the land surface rdls is a macroscopic index used to describe the terrain characteristics of a region and is used to express the difference between the altitudes of the highest point and the lowest point in a specific region according to the definition of the rdls an altitude of 500 m was regarded as the height of china s benchmark mountain feng et al 2008 the rdls could then be calculated as shown in eq 4 4 rdls m a x h m i n h 1 p a a 500 where max h and min h are the highest and lowest elevations m in the region respectively p a is the flat area km2 in the region and a is the total area of the region 2 3 2 structural elements according to the urban system structure structural elements are components of the construction environment urban anatomy defines the construction environment as a physical facility environment established based on the natural environment to meet the needs of human survival and sustainable development which maintains the rapid and stable operation of urban areas international organization for standardization 2019 therefore structural elements are divided into four categories construction area green facilities transport facilities and water circulation facilities xiang 2014 the construction area was represented by the proportion of the built up area pba and construction land according to the china construction statistical yearbook the proportion of construction land includes the proportions of residential land prl public management and service land ppmsl industrial land pil logistics and storage land plsl which are equal to the proportion of the area of the corresponding land type to the total urban area wu et al 2020b green facilities are represented by the green coverage rate gcr urban transport facilities primarily include roads railways and intersections chen et al 2020 therefore the road area rate rar density of the road network drn urban rail transit system completed urts c urban rail transit system under construction urts u and number of intersections ni were adopted wu et al 2019 the water circulation facilities related to urban rainstorm floods are predominantly urban drainage pipe networks which are represented by the density of sewers ds 2 3 3 social elements urban anatomy defines social elements as interaction products between people and the construction environment international organization for standardization 2019 therefore social elements are primarily composed of people the government and their derivatives people can be divided into the managers i e government and managed i e residents and were represented by the population density pd the government refers to the body of state s rule and social management and their effective prevention and emergency management play positive roles in urban rainstorm floods and the number of government employees nge in water conservancy and municipal industries urban gross domestic product gdp was selected because economic loss was considered as an indicator of flood loss in this study hence an indicator system for urban elements that are closely related to urban flooding was established as shown in fig 6 all the indicator data were extracted from the china urban construction statistical yearbook urban water resources bulletin and china flood and drought disaster bulletin wu et al 2020b 2 4 random forest model rf is a machine learning algorithm proposed by leo breiman 2001 which combines the bagging ensemble learning theory with the stochastic subspace method currently the algorithm has been widely used because of its good performance such as the identification of the association of gene sequences in the field of biological information boulesteix et al 2012 the recognition of the most important environmental variables in the ecological distribution of species and populations ellis et al 2012 and the analysis of the impact characteristics of global change yu et al 2019 numerous theories and examples have demonstrated that rfs have strong data mining ability and high prediction accuracy with a good tolerance for outliers and noise it has good scalability and parallelism for high dimensional data classification problems without being prone to overfitting and is known as one of the best algorithms at present iverson et al 2008 2 4 1 model building process rf is an ensemble learning model based on a decision tree it contains multiple decision trees trained using bagging ensemble learning technology when the samples to be classified are input the final classification result is determined by voting on the output of a single decision tree in addition rf is a data driven nonparametric classification method which only needs to train the classification rules by learning the given samples without prior knowledge rf is a classifier composed of a series of tree classifiers the generating steps are shown in fig 7 1 select k sub training sample sets with bootstrap sampling from the input urban rainstorm flood loss and urban factors sample sets and pre build k classification trees 2 select the optimal segmentation indicator on each node of the classification tree for segmentation 3 repeat step 2 until the pre built k taxonomic trees are traversed 4 rf is formed by k taxonomic trees the input training sets were obtained by bootstrap random sampling and the indicators of the classification tree nodes were segmented randomly ensuring that the correlation between the classification trees was reduced a single tree without pruning can obtain a low deviation classification tree ensuring the accuracy of the results 2 4 2 analysis of the relative importance of urban element indicators the program recursion method is typically adopted to generate the decision trees the root node splits and generates two subtrees that is the left and right subtrees then the subtrees will not stop generating new nodes and subtrees until the leaf nodes are generated to choose the best split mode the split results should be compared when the subtrees are generated because different split modes cause distinct results hence the selection of the decision tree generation algorithms that correspond to the comparison rules is critical in this process the cart algorithm which has been further optimized to solve classification and regression problems based on other algorithms deals with discrete attribute variables efficiently and reasonably yu et al 2019 therefore the cart algorithm was adopted to determine the split mode in the analysis of the relative importance of the urban element indicators associated with urban rainstorm flood disasters the node gini coefficient represents the impurity as shown in eq 5 5 gini f d 1 k p d 1 p d 1 d 1 k p d f 2 where gini f is the gini coefficient of node f and the smaller gini f the lower the impurity meaning that the sample data at node f tend toward the same disaster level the larger gini f the higher the impurity meaning that the sample data at node f tend to be evenly distributed and less useful information is obtained p d f is the probability of a disaster grade d at node f the importance of the urban element indicator uj on node f is the change in the gini index when f splits as shown in eq 6 6 vi m jf g i n i g i n i f g i n i l g i n i r where vi m jf g i n i is the importance of the urban element indicator uj on node f and gini l and gini r are the gini indices of the two new nodes generated by node f splitting respectively if the nodes in decision tree i composed of urban element indicator uj belong to set m the importance of uj in decision tree i can be calculated according to eq 7 7 vi m ij g i n i f m vi m jf g i n i where vi m ij g i n i is the importance of uj in the decision tree i if there are n trees in rf then 8 vi m j g i n i i 1 n vi m ij g i n i where vi m j g i n i is the importance of uj in all the decision trees finally the relative importance of the urban element indicator uj in urban rainstorm flood disasters can be obtained by normalization as shown in eq 9 9 vi m j vi m j g i n i j 1 j vi m j g i n i where vi m j is the relative importance of uj in an urban rainstorm flood disaster and the sum vi m j of all indicators is 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 results and verification taking the flood losses of beijing tianjin and chongqing from 2006 to 2017 as examples the rf model was used to analyze the relative importance of the specific indicators of natural elements structural elements and social elements the results are provided in fig 8 to verify the accuracy of the results the catastrophe evaluation method was used to evaluate the risk of urban rainstorm floods in shanghai from 2012 to 2017 the catastrophe evaluation method was systematically expounded by french mathematician rene thom 1977 and has been widely used in the quantitative analysis of non equilibrium phase transition processes chen et al 2016 and serves water resource assessments well wu et al 2020a the catastrophe evaluation method adopts a recursive calculation to determine the value of the upper index according to the basic index values when there is no obvious connection among the basic indicators the upper index value is equal to the minimum value of the standardized basic index values when there is an obvious connection between the basic indicators the upper index value is equal to the average value of the standardized basic index values based on the relative importance of the indicators in fig 8 a systematic risk assessment was conducted a comparison between the risk assessment results and actual losses is shown in table 1 according to table 1 the rank of the catastrophe evaluation results is highly consistent with the actual direct economic losses except for 2015 owing to the characteristics of the catastrophe evaluation method the risk assessment results will have a large deviation when the indicator score is the maximum or the minimum that is 1 or 0 ge et al 2019 the score of the natural element in 2015 was 1 causing it to be ranked first in the catastrophe evaluation results when this singularity is eliminated the rank of the evaluation results is completely consistent with the actual losses which shows that the relative importance of urban element indicators analyzed based on the rf model is reasonable 3 2 discussion according to fig 8 the swr is the most significant indicator of the natural elements that cause urban rainstorm flood disasters because the flood storage capacity of an urban area will not change significantly in the short term the more swr of the urban area the less spare flood storage capacity and the higher the flood disaster risk furthermore arfs also plays a critical role in urban rainstorm flood disasters which is consistent with the results of ji et al 2013 however the rdls is much less important than the swr and arfs even though a higher rdls results in a higher flood risk ji et al 2013 as a long term stable natural condition the rdls of an urban area cannot change greatly over decades leading to little effect on the urban rainstorm flood losses combined with the relative importance of the three indicators and whether they are easy to control the most effective urban flood disaster risk management measure is improving the accuracy of rainfall forecasting and the early warning ability of urban rainstorm flood risk the pba has the highest relative importance among the structural elements indicating that the higher the degree and concentration of urban development and construction the higher the flood disaster risk except for the pba the prl is much more significant than other indicators because transportation personnel and economy gather around residential land in china increasing the difficulty in disaster relief and the intensity of disaster losses furthermore both the proportions of public management and service land ppmsl and logistics and storage land plsl are highly important however because industrial land is mostly located at the edge of the city and the density of the surrounding population is small the proportion of industrial land pil has the least relative importance on flood disaster risk hence the proportion of construction land composed of residential land public management and service land logistics and storage land and industrial land has a significant effect on urban flood disaster risk and should be planned more reasonably for example dispersing the population gathering areas and reducing the local pd as the key process for a city to digest rainwater the drainage pipeline is directly related to the formation process of urban rainstorm floods however according to fig 8 the relative importance of the ds only reaches the average level of all the indicators and is lower than expected this can be attributed to the rapid development of china due to which the construction of urban drainage networks cannot keep up with the development needs in many cities limiting their role in the relief of urban rainstorm flood disasters therefore the ds in china should be effectively improved to drain urban floods over time to reduce potential losses the pd has a higher correlation with the flood loss compared with other indicators among the social elements which indicates that the places with high population density may have a high risk of flood losses which is consistent with the high importance of the pba in addition the nge has an effect on the magnitude of flood losses the greater the investment in human resources in related industries the higher the management and construction of related work in the region which has a positive effect on the reduction of flood losses therefore increasing the input of staff in water conservancy and municipal management is necessary especially in low lying and residential areas 4 conclusions based on the formation of urban flood losses the urban elements related to urban rainstorm flood disasters were proposed that is natural elements structural elements and social elements and the specific indicators were analyzed taking four representative cities as examples the sensitivity indicators were identified according to the relative importance analysis based on the rf model and the results were verified by the catastrophe evaluation method urban rainstorm flood disasters are much more sensitive to swr arfs pba prl ppmsl plsl ds and pd than to other indicators and has the least sensitivity to the rdls in order to mitigate urban rainstorm flood disasters considering whether the indicators are easy to control a the accuracy of rainfall forecasting and early warning ability of urban rainstorm flood risks should be improved b combined with the weather forecast water in the city can be discharged in advance to reduce the swr and create more capacity to accommodate the potential flood c residential land can be scattered to reduce the pd and d the ds and the input of staff in water conservancy and municipal management should be increased however with an increase in sample size the accuracy of the research results will be higher hence the model performance should be further tested with other urban rainstorm flood disaster data when

4467,urban rainstorm floods have become one of the most significant natural disasters that restrict the healthy development of the economy and society it is imperative to reduce the risk of urban rainstorm flood disasters which is growing along with urbanization during the process of urban planning and construction however because of the complexity of urban elements it is quite difficult to identify sensitive indicators of urban rainstorm flood disasters to provide effective guidance on flood control in this study the composition of urban elements was systematically proposed based on descriptive framework for cities and communities including natural structural and social elements and then a specific indicator system was established furthermore random forest model was used to determine the relative importance of the indicators that are closely related to the direct economic loss that reflects the severity of urban rainstorm flood disasters considering four cities in china beijing tianjin chongqing and shanghai with different topographical and hydrological conditions as examples the sensitivity indicators of urban rainstorm flood disasters were identified and the results were verified based on the catastrophe evaluation method the results indicate that urban rainstorm flood disasters are the most sensitive to surface water resources and are the least sensitive to relief degree of land surface finally specific measures to mitigate urban rainstorm flood disasters were proposed keywords urban flood urban element random forest economic loss relative importance 1 introduction because of anthropogenic activities and climate change daksiya et al 2021 li and sivapalan 2020 urban rainstorm flood disasters have gradually become one of the most significant risks to human survival and social development aerts et al 2014 according to the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china more than 100 cities in china suffered from urban floods every year from 2008 to 2018 causing direct economic losses of 374 5 267 5 315 6 and 364 3 billion yuan in 2010 2012 2013 and 2016 respectively therefore urban rainstorm flood disasters have become a crucial problem that restricts the sustainable and healthy development of china s economy and society yin et al 2015 zheng et al 2016 urban flood management has become a popular research topic including drainage hellmers et al 2017 rainstorm flood forecasting and early warning yan et al 2018 storm water management and utilization schaer et al 2018 and flood risk analysis mcclean et al 2020 andersen et al 2013 demonstrated that topographic and anthropogenic influences exacerbate or reduce flood risks by altering the surface runoff infiltration storage and precipitation development yu and coulthard 2015 revealed the effects of catchment hydrological parameters on urban floods chang and huang 2015 found that land use and land cover changes have contributed to an increase in urban flooding tian et al 2019 derived critical thresholds beyond which urban pluvial flooding is likely to occur based on a decadal dataset of radar rainfall maps thanvisitthpon 2019 investigated the impact of land use transformation and anti flood structural infrastructure on flooding in four flood prone districts in thailand anni et al 2020 analyzed the role of stormwater infrastructure and soil infiltration in urban floods furthermore in addition to rainfall and the underlying surface urban planning and management have a significant impact on urban flooding zhou et al 2019 löwe et al 2017 proved that urban planning policies are an efficient means for urban flood reduction rezende et al 2019 used socio economic indices to analyze urban flood resilience li and sivapalan 2020 analyzed the substantial role of human actions in urban floods and urban water systems these studies revealed the impacts of some factors on urban floods to a certain extent through the analysis of the physical mechanism of urban flooding however these studies are inadequate for complex urban systems because of their overreliance on simplistic methods at large scales saksena et al 2020 with the characteristics of a highly concentrated population and facilities complex spatial structure high speed dynamic operations and evolution urban areas are complex and vast systems coupled with nature and humanity which is distinct from any other natural system li and willems 2020 this system consists of mutual relationships and interactions among various elements including not only natural elements and structural elements such as topography and underlying surface but also social elements such as government intervention and economic effects urban flood response has striking spatial heterogeneities in peak flood magnitudes response times and runoff ratios which are primarily linked to the watershed scale distribution of impervious cover and storm water management zhou et al 2019 therefore to identify the sensitivity indicators of urban rainstorm flood disasters it is necessary to comprehensively analyze the related urban elements urban elements cause urban flooding and economic losses when combined with rainstorms attracting the attention of society ge et al 2020 bermúdez and zischg 2019 explored the sensitivity of flood loss estimates to the spatial representation of buildings and hazard attribution methods grantham et al 2019 described a set of climate informed ecological resilience principles and the associated indicators to guide climate adaptive water resource management lee and brody 2019 verified that a high density development of compact designs decreases flood loss even though urban built up land with higher impervious surfaces may cause more flood damage waghwala and agnihotri 2019 stressed that the lack of flood management in urban areas led to increasing flood losses in urban sprawl pinos et al 2020 estimated the direct damage caused by urban floods with different return periods based on a univariable deterministic flood loss model mei et al 2020 found that both rainfall intensity and rainfall patterns are the determining factors of urban flooding despite the increase in flood hazards and exposure information accuracy the estimation of losses is a poorly understood component of pluvial flood risk quantification rözer et al 2019 however with the increase in flood loss data and the rapid development of big data technology that explores information quickly and easily ge et al 2021 the identification of sensitivity indicators of urban rainstorm flood disasters can be realized based on the actual loss providing new ideas for urban flood disaster management machine learning algorithms are increasingly being used in natural disaster risk assessments li et al 2019 used four machine learning algorithms to identify flood sensitivity indicators and assessed the risk in river basins involving thirteen indicators the results indicated that random forest rf performed the best in the test and could be used as an effective and reliable tool in flood sensitivity assessments hence this study established an indicator system for urban rainstorm flooding based on an urban element analysis and determined the relative importance of the indicators based on the rf algorithm to identify the urban rainstorm flood disaster sensitive indicators providing a reference for urban construction planning and disaster control 2 materials and methods 2 1 study areas the study focuses on four municipalities that are directly under the central government of china that is beijing tianjin chongqing and shanghai which play vital roles in the politics economy culture tourism and other aspects of the country the four cities have varying topographical and hydrological conditions the capital city beijing is located in northern china tianjin close to beijing is the largest port city in northern china chongqing is the largest industrial and commercial city in southwest china shanghai is the economic financial and cultural center and located in east china the geographical conditions of the four cities are shown in fig 1 by the end of 2017 the urbanization rates of beijing tianjin and shanghai exceeded 80 and the urbanization rate of chongqing increased from 48 10 to 64 08 from 2006 to 2017 in this study data regarding the urban elements and the direct economic losses due to flooding for beijing tianjin and chongqing from 2006 to 2017 were used as the sample data while those for shanghai 2012 2017 were used as the validation data from 2006 to 2017 the proportions of the years that beijing tianjin chongqing and shanghai experienced direct losses due to urban flood were 75 58 83 and 75 respectively as shown in fig 2 2 2 urban rainstorm flood disaster system analysis urban rainstorm flood disasters are typical natural disasters that are affected by traditional hydrological factors and anthropogenic factors such as land use population and wealth accumulation resulting from urbanization the process of urban rainstorm flood disasters follows the chain development of natural disaster systems wu et al 2020b the rain falls into the urban system and continuously produces surface confluence from the interaction between the topography and the underlying surface when the surface confluence exceeds the urban drainage capacity urban flooding occurs and may cause an economic loss the formation process of the disaster chain system divides the variables into input variables state variables and output variables as a disaster causing factor rainfall is an input variable a state variable is the state of the participating factors that form the urban flood disaster that is the state of the urban flood and the related urban elements intuitively the output variable is the disaster loss the mode of the urban rainstorm flood disaster chain is shown in fig 3 according to fig 3 the state of urban flooding is formed by the interaction between the rainfall and urban elements related to urban flooding as shown in eq 1 1 f r u where f is the urban flood state and r and u are the states of the rainfall and urban elements related to urban flooding respectively the loss due to urban rainstorm flood disasters is caused by urban flooding and urban elements as shown in eq 2 2 l f u where l is the urban flood disaster loss hence the loss due to urban rainstorm flood disasters is directly determined by the rainfall and the states of the urban elements as shown in eq 3 3 l r u 2 3 urban elements analysis in response to the needs of the united nations un world bank organization for economic co operation and development oecd and other international organizations and countries for urban sustainable development standards the sustainable cities and communities of the international organization for standardization 2019 established the standard of the descriptive framework for cities and communities iso dis 317105 which uses the analogy between the human anatomy and dynamic physiology to describe cities also known as the urban anatomy this standard outlines that the city can be understood as an ecosystem which can be divided into three parts the living entity in the ecosystem the physical structure and the interaction between the two lin and xia 2013 the living entity refers to human beings and the physical structure refers to the composition of physical factors that ensure all the human activities in the city which is manifested as the physical structure of the city the interaction between them is manifested mainly as social elements including life work education economy culture and information hence the urban system structure can be determined as shown in fig 4 urban rainstorm flood disasters result from the interaction between rainfall and the elements of the urban system structure rainfall is also a natural factor that can be attributed to the natural elements of urban floods hence the types of urban elements associated with urban rainstorm flood disasters can be determined which are divided into natural elements structural elements and social elements as shown in

decades leading to little effect on the urban rainstorm flood losses combined with the relative importance of the three indicators and whether they are easy to control the most effective urban flood disaster risk management measure is improving the accuracy of rainfall forecasting and the early warning ability of urban rainstorm flood risk the pba has the highest relative importance among the structural elements indicating that the higher the degree and concentration of urban development and construction the higher the flood disaster risk except for the pba the prl is much more significant than other indicators because transportation personnel and economy gather around residential land in china increasing the difficulty in disaster relief and the intensity of disaster losses furthermore both the proportions of public management and service land ppmsl and logistics and storage land plsl are highly important however because industrial land is mostly located at the edge of the city and the density of the surrounding population is small the proportion of industrial land pil has the least relative importance on flood disaster risk hence the proportion of construction land composed of residential land public management and service land logistics and storage land and industrial land has a significant effect on urban flood disaster risk and should be planned more reasonably for example dispersing the population gathering areas and reducing the local pd as the key process for a city to digest rainwater the drainage pipeline is directly related to the formation process of urban rainstorm floods however according to fig 8 the relative importance of the ds only reaches the average level of all the indicators and is lower than expected this can be attributed to the rapid development of china due to which the construction of urban drainage networks cannot keep up with the development needs in many cities limiting their role in the relief of urban rainstorm flood disasters therefore the ds in china should be effectively improved to drain urban floods over time to reduce potential losses the pd has a higher correlation with the flood loss compared with other indicators among the social elements which indicates that the places with high population density may have a high risk of flood losses which is consistent with the high importance of the pba in addition the nge has an effect on the magnitude of flood losses the greater the investment in human resources in related industries the higher the management and construction of related work in the region which has a positive effect on the reduction of flood losses therefore increasing the input of staff in water conservancy and municipal management is necessary especially in low lying and residential areas 4 conclusions based on the formation of urban flood losses the urban elements related to urban rainstorm flood disasters were proposed that is natural elements structural elements and social elements and the specific indicators were analyzed taking four representative cities as examples the sensitivity indicators were identified according to the relative importance analysis based on the rf model and the results were verified by the catastrophe evaluation method urban rainstorm flood disasters are much more sensitive to swr arfs pba prl ppmsl plsl ds and pd than to other indicators and has the least sensitivity to the rdls in order to mitigate urban rainstorm flood disasters considering whether the indicators are easy to control a the accuracy of rainfall forecasting and early warning ability of urban rainstorm flood risks should be improved b combined with the weather forecast water in the city can be discharged in advance to reduce the swr and create more capacity to accommodate the potential flood c residential land can be scattered to reduce the pd and d the ds and the input of staff in water conservancy and municipal management should be increased however with an increase in sample size the accuracy of the research results will be higher hence the model performance should be further tested with other urban rainstorm flood disaster data when

4468,reference evapotranspiration et0 is a key component of the water cycle in this study a modified penman monteith method incorporating the co2 effect on surface resistance was used to estimate past change in et0 in china for 1961 2019 and to project future changes for 2040 2099 a partial differential equation was used to attribute the changes in et0 results indicated the following 1 a shift point in the annual et0 series occurred in 1993 in which annual et0 in china had been decreasing and then increased significantly by 18 93 and 11 19 mm decade 1 before and after 1993 respectively with et0 having changed most drastically within the temperate continental climate zone 2 wind speed and solar radiation were the major dominant factors responsible for the change in et0 during 1961 1992 and their contribution rates were 48 30 and 38 92 respectively during 1993 2019 increasing maximum air temperature was the dominant factor contributing to increasing et0 with a contribution rate of 81 71 yet wind speed was the dominant factor affecting et0 changes at 45 of the stations in china 3 in future projections maximum air temperature is expected to be the dominant factor influencing the increase in et0 the values of which were projected at 1 49 and 16 05 mm decade 1 during 2040 2099 under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively with projections from five gcms the increasing surface resistance response to elevated co2 was found to be an important contributor to the decrease in et0 particularly for the rcp8 5 scenario the increase in surface resistance was found to lead to the decrease in et0 by 0 68 mm year 1 42 37 this suggests that historical and future tendencies towards aridity in china may be considerably weaker and less extensive than previously assumed keywords reference evapotranspiration attribution analysis surface resistance co2 climate change 1 introduction reference evapotranspiration et0 serves as one of the major components of the hydrological cycle and is an important indicator of global climate change han et al 2014 hupet and vanclooster 2001 sentelhas et al 2010 with increasing co2 and other heat trapping gases in the atmosphere the global mean surface temperature has risen by approximately 0 85 since the late 19th century stocker et al 2014 trenberth et al 2013 global warming is expected to increase et0 and accelerate hydrological cycles around the world fu et al 2013 jiang et al 2011 which is contradictory to the downward trend of et0 and or pan evaporation of the last few decades hence the concept of the evaporation paradox brutsaert and parlange 1998 hobbins et al 2004 the reasons for decreasing et0 and or pan evaporation have been widely discussed some researchers have revealed that the decreasing trend in et0 cannot solely consider the increase in air temperature this is because changes in et0 are also driven by other meteorological variables such as radiation vapor pressure ea and wind speed u2 generally decreasing et0 has been consistent with decreasing surface solar radiation rs over the same periods in various studies around the world some studies have reported that a decrease in rs was the main factor causing a decrease in et0 in ireland stanhill and möller 2008 and the yangtze river basin wang et al 2007 xu et al 2006 similarly the contribution of u2 changes to trends in et0 is an important aspect the decrease in the observed near surface wind speed is a global phenomenon mcvicar et al 2012 some researchers investigated that declining rates of u2 were the main factor contributing to decreasing et0 in many regions around the world such as canada burn and hesch 2007 australia roderick et al 2007 iran dinpashoh et al 2011 the tibetan plateau liu et al 2011 and the non monsoon region of china dong et al 2020b moreover ea plays a key role in the evaporation process and has been identified as the dominant factor influencing the decrease in et0 in limited regions tabari et al 2011 to determine et0 the penman monteith method which is recommended by the food and agricultural organization fao has been successfully used under different conditions and explicitly incorporates all the driving variables especially when sufficient meteorological data is available abdelhadi et al 2000 allen et al 1998 gavilan and castillo llanque 2009 goyal 2004 kang et al 2003 xu et al 2006 previous research on the factors affecting et0 change has mainly focused on climate factors without considering other variables such as surface resistance rs which is fixed at 70 s m 1 during the et0 calculation using the fao penman monteith equation however this equation only poorly simulates the effect of co2 concentration and many studies have shown that co2 concentration affects rs which in turn affects et0 ben hamouda and ventura 2020 long et al 2004 mall et al 2017 at present very few researchers have considered the variability of rs when estimating the et0 using the fao penman monteith equation and its attribution yet disregarding the increase in rs under changing concentrations of co2 results in the overestimation of the et0 milly and dunne 2016 roderick et al 2015 yang et al 2018b therefore incorporating the response of rs into an increasing concentration of co2 in the et0 estimation formula is necessary to obtain more accurate assessments of changes and impacts of et0 in relation to phenomena such as drought yang et al 2018b therefore in this study the fao penman monteith equation has been modified to account for the impact of atmospheric co2 concentration changes on r s moreover to characterize this effect when considering air temperature previous studies have rarely distinguished the effect of maximum tmax and minimum tmin air temperatures and have used instead average air temperature dong et al 2020b however related results have indicated that tmax and tmin vary according to different patterns and further that their respective contributions to et0 differ from each other li et al 2013 wu et al 2017 yin et al 2010 therefore in order to address all these factors in this study the contributions of the driving variables tmax tmin u2 rs ea and rs were quantitatively assessed to determine related changes in et0 different attribution analysis methods such as sensitivity analyses fan and thomas 2018 li et al 2017 sharifi and dinpashoh 2014 multiple regression analyses han et al 2018 li et al 2014 shan et al 2015 and partial differential methods roderick et al 2007 wang et al 2016 yang et al 2018a zheng et al 2009 have been used to quantify the contribution of driving factors to the change in et0 in previous studies of these sensitivity analyses have been used to determine the change rate of et0 in response to the change rate of meteorological factors huo et al 2013 while multiple regression analysis has been used to assess the relative contribution of change in the meteorological factor to the change in et0 pryor and ledolter 2010 typically a multiple regression analysis would be performed on a meteorological factor series to establish the multiple linear regression equation involving multiple independent variables however neither of these methods considers the evaporative process rather they consider only the variation of the results thus providing the relative contributions of meteorological variables without calculating the actual contributions to et0 and are therefore not ideal quantitative methods wang et al 2016 as an alternative approach the partial differential method has been widely used to attribute the change in pan evaporation liu and mcvicar 2012 wang et al 2015 and has also been widely used in attribution analyses for et0 in recent years dong et al 2020b ning et al 2016 based on a full physical formulation of et0 the partial differential method is able to calculate the actual contribution of each variable to et0 therefore in this study a detailed derivation process is provided to allow for the application of this differential equation method to the study of et0 in china the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the spatial and temporal variations of et0 and climate factors in china during 1961 2019 2 identify the contributions of climatic factors and rs to changes in et0 using the partial differential method and 3 predict the responses of et0 to climate change and its attribution during 2040 2099 under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios with projections from five global circulation models gcms the findings are expected to provide useful information for researchers and policymakers to assess impacts of the climate change and human activities on the hydrological cycle 2 methods and data 2 1 study area and data china can be divided into five climatic zones the tropical monsoon trm subtropical monsoon sm temperature monsoon tm temperate continental tc and mountain plateau mp climate zones fig 1 daily meteorological data from 1961 to 2019 at 795 national meteorological stations including daily tmin tmax wind speed at 10 m u10 relative humidity rh and sunshine hours ssd were acquired from the national meteorological information center china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn a few missing data were replaced by values obtained for the same period observed by the nearest station annual mean co2

atmospheric concentrations of co2 from mauna loa represented the global co2 concentration changes in the ipcc reports pachauri and reisinger 2014 and were used to represent the co2 concentration

hempel et al 2013 with coverage for the period ranging from 2040 to 2099 2 2 research methods 2 2 1 calculation of et 0 the fao penman monteith equation has been widely used to calculate et0 allen et al 1998 in this equation rs is fixed at 70 s m 1 regardless of climate type and change in climate patterns and is represented by the value 0 34 in the denominator assuming that the rs is considered constant applies to a specific co2 concentration hence estimating a new rs value for elevated co2 concentration provides a method to estimate possible impacts of higher co2 on et0 ben hamouda and ventura 2020 thus the following form of the fao penman monteith equation was adopted 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 2 0 34 u 2 70 208 u 2 r s u 2 208 where et0 is the

kpa c 1 and rs is the surface resistance s m 1 because plant stomata generally open less widely under increased co2 concentration which increases rs field et al 1995 rs was calculated using the empirical function of the co2 concentration recommended by yang et al 2018b 3 r s 70 0 05 co 2 300 where rs is the surface resistance s m 1 and co2 is the concentration of co2 ppm net radiation was calculated via the following formulas using the observed sunshine hours maximum and minimum air temperatures data 4 r n r ns r nl 5 r n s 1 α r s 6 r s a s b s ssd n r a where α is the albedo of the

min r s u 2 e a r s attributing the change in et0 can be approximately estimated by the following differential equation method zheng et al 2009 10 d e t 0 d t e t 0 t max d t max d t e t 0 t min d t min d t e t 0 r s d r s d t e t 0 u 2 d u 2 d t e t 0 e a d e a d t e t 0 r s d r s d t δ or simplified as follows 11 l e t 0 c t max c t min c r s c u 2 c e a c r s δ c e t 0 δ where c tmax c tmin c rs c u2 c ea and c rs are individual contributions to the long term trend in et0 due to the change in tmax tmin u2 rs ea and rs respectively the sum contributions of c tmax c tmin c rs c u2 c ea and c rs is simplified as c et0 then δ is the error item between the c et0 and et0 trend calculated by linear regression l et0 furthermore the individual relative contribution of each driving variable to the trend in et0 can be estimated as follows 12 rc x i c x i l e t 0 100 where rc xi is the relative contribution and xi is the driving variable 2 2 3 trend and abrupt change analysis sen s method sen 1968 was used to estimate the magnitudes of trends in et0 and six driving factors in this study sen s slope estimator β can be calculated as follows 13 β m e d i a n x j x k j k 1 k j where xj and xk are the data value at times j and k respectively a positive β indicates an upward trend in the time series while a negative β indicates a downward trend the mann kendall mk test has widely been used to identify the significance of hydrologic and climatic trends ding et al 2019 han et al 2018 in this study the mk test was used to identify the significance of et0 with each of the six driving factors series in this method the test statistic z is estimated as follows 14 z s 1 σ s 2 0 s 1 σ s 2 if if if s 0 s 0 s 0 15 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i 16 sgn x 1 0 1 if if if x j x i x j x i x j

given time the null hypothesis h0 indicates non significance and is accepted if the statistic z is not statistically significant i e z z1 a 2 in which z1 a 2 are the standard normal deviates positive z indicates an upward trend in the time series while negative z indicates a downward trend finally cramer s test zhang et al 2013 has widely been used to detect the change points of hydrological and meteorological series in this study cramer s test was used to detect the change points of et0 series during 1961 2019 3 results 3 1 change in et0 fig 2 a and 2b show the variation of annual et0 in china from 1961 and 2019 and the results of the cramer s test for identifying the shift point of annual long term et0 series respectively a turning point in annual et0 series was detected around the year 1993 fig 2b hence we further divided the study duration from 1961 to 2019 into two periods 1961 1992 period i and 1993 2019 period ii annual et0 decreased significantly p 0 001 by 18 93 mm decade 1 during period i then increased significantly p 0 05 by 11 19 mm decade 1 during period ii table 1 for the five climatic zones before 1993 annual et0 decreased significantly p 0 001 in sm tm and tc respectively and decreased insignificantly p 0 05 in trm yet increased insignificantly p 0 05 in mp after 1993 annual et0 increased significantly p 0 001 in mp and sm and increased insignificantly p 0 05 in trm tm and tc respectively fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of trends in annual et0 at the 795 meteorological stations before and after 1993 during period i annual et0 decreased at 653 stations 82 14 and decreasing trends were significant p 0 05 at 401 stations 50 44 during period ii annual et0 increased at 533 stations 69 56 and increasing trends were significant p 0 05 at 235 stations 29 56 3 2 changes in driving factors because change in et0 is known to result from the combined effect of climatic factors and other variables such as tmax tmin rs u2 ea and rs the analysis of each driving factor before and after 1993 is essential fig 4 shows the variation of five climate variables and rs in china from 1961 and 2019 tmax decreased insignificantly p 0 05 at rate of 0 02 decade 1 before 1993 then increased significantly p 0 01 at rate of 0 42 decade 1 for the china average a similar trend in tmax was observed for sm while the other four climatic zones exhibited an increasing trend in tmax during period i for the china average tmin increased significantly p 0 001 by 0 23 and 0 33 decade 1 before and after 1993 similar trends in tmax were also observed in all five climatic zones except in tm the increasing trend in tmax during period i was lower than that during period ii before 1993 u2 decreased dramatically p 0 001 by 0 11 m s 1 decade 1 and for the china average during period ii an insignificantly p 0 05 slight declining trend was observed at a rate of 0 01 m s 1 decade 1 this change in u2 was spatially uneven in that the decreasing trends in u2 slowed in trm and tm but showed a recovery in sm and tc following 1993 during period i rs showed a significantly p 0 001 declining trend with a rate of 0 22 mj m 2 day 1 decade 1 while for the china average during period ii rs decreased significantly p 0 05 with significantly lower amplitude trends of 0 06 mj m 2 day 1 this rs reduction was largely in trm sm and tm before 1993 with the main reason likely being related to the rapid increase of aerosols accompanied with urbanization in those areas zhang et al 2010 during period i ea did not show a change trend but a slightly upward trend by 0 01 kpa decade 1 during period ii was observed for the china average rs exhibited dramatically p 0 001 increasing trends during periods i and ii at rates of 0 66 s m 1 and 1 03 s m 1 decade 1 respectively 3 3 contributions of changes in driving variables to et0 the contributions of the six driving variables to the change in annual et0 were estimated according to equation 10 and 11 as shown in fig 5 the calculated et0 trends c et0 fitted well with the detected et0 trends l et0 by linear regression with r2 0 92 by comparing all stations in china during the two periods indicating the suitability of using the partial differential method to attribute the changes in et0 the contribution of the six driving factors on et0 rate are shown in table 2 during period i the changes in tmax tmin rs u2 ea and rs were found to have led to change in et0 by 0 08 0 47 0 74 0 91 0 02 and 0 16 mm year 1 respectively with corresponding contribution percentages of 4 35 24 77 38 92 48 30 0 90 and 8 46 the combined effects of the six driving factors resulted in a decrease in et0 by 1 44 mm year 1 the increasing tmin was found to have led to an increase in et0 while during period i the effect was offset by the changing tmax rs u2 ea and rs during period ii the change in tmax tmin rs u2 ea and rs were found to have led to the change in et0 by 0 91 0 70 0 17 0 05 0 38 and 0 22 mm year 1 respectively with corresponding contribution percentages of 81 71 62 24 15 27 4 39 34 30 and 19 42 this result indicated that temperature was the dominant factor affecting et0 which is consistent with the findings of a recent study by tegos et al 2017 during period ii the positive effects of tmax tmin and u2 offset the influence of rs ea and rs which caused an increase in et0 overall the combined effects of the six driving factors resulted in an increase in et0 by 0 89 mm year 1 within the five climatic regions during period i decreasing rs was the dominant factor influencing the decrease of et0 in trm and sm and decreasing u2 was the dominant factor influencing the decrease of et0 in tm and tc while increasing tmin was the dominant factor influencing the increase of et0 in mp during period ii increasing tmin was the dominant factor influencing the increase of et0 in trm while increasing tmax was the dominant factor influencing the increase of et0 in the other four climatic zones fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of dominant driving variables for the change in et0 at all 795 stations in china during periods i and ii before 1993 rs and u2 were the dominant factors for the et0 change at approximately 33 and 36 of the stations respectively whereas tmax tmin and ea were the dominant factors at approximately 8 14 and 9 of the stations respectively spatially rs was the dominant factor at most stations in sm while u2 was the dominant factor in tm and tc after 1993 u2 became the dominant factor for the change in et0 at approximately 45 of the stations in china and was also the dominant factor at most stations in sm tm and tc tmax was the dominant factor at approximately 21 of the stations mostly located in tm lastly ea tmin and rs were the dominant factors at approximately 15 10 and 9 of the stations respectively 3 4 future change in et0 and driving factors to predict et0 trends for the future the change in et0 was estimated for the period ranging from 2040 to 2099 using the modified penman monteith formula based on the average output of five gcms under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios table 3 shows the trends of annual et0 and six driving factors from 2040 to 2099 under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios according to the results annual et0 could increase insignificantly p 0 05 by 1 49 mm decade 1 under the rcp4 5 scenario for the china average while et0 could increase significantly p 0 001 by 16 05 mm decade 1 under the rcp8 5 scenario similar trends in et0 were also observed in the five climatic zones and for tc the increasing trend in et0 under the rcp8 5 scenario would be approximately 18 times as that under the rcp4 5 scenario both tmax and tmin could increase insignificantly p 0 05 under the rcp4 5 scenario and could increase significantly p 0 001 under the rcp8 5 scenario respectively rs could increase significantly p 0 001 under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively whereas u2 could decrease significantly p 0 001 under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively it was found that ea could increase significantly p 0 01 under the rcp4 5 scenario and could increase significantly p 0 001 under the rcp8 5 scenario finally rs could increase significantly p 0 001 under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively 3 5 contributions of future driving variables to changes in et0 table 4 shows the estimated contributions of the driving factors to the future predicted change in et0 during 2040 2099 obtained by the product of the partial derivatives and the change rate of the six factors based on the average output of the five gcms under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios results show that the changes in tmax tmin rs u2 ea and rs could lead to a change in et0 by 0 27 0 14 0 09 0 11 0 19 and 0 12 mm year 1 respectively under the rcp4 5 scenario and by 2 59 1 33 0 08 0 08 2 01 and 0 68 mm year 1 respectively under the rcp8 5 scenario for both scenarios increasing tmax tmin and rs could lead to the increase in et0 and would offset the negative effects of u2 ea and rs to et0 for all five climatic zones under both scenarios increasing tmax was expected to be the dominant factor influencing the increase in et0 fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of the dominant driving variables for the change in et0 at 3834 grids in china during 2040 2099 under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios under the rcp4 5 scenario tmax was the dominant factor influencing approximately 68 of the grids whereas tmin ea and rs were the dominant factors influencing approximately 8 8 and 2 of the grids respectively rs was dominant influencing approximately 5 of the grids mostly located in sm while u2 was dominant for approximately 8 of the grids mostly located in sm and tm under the rcp8 5 scenario tmax was dominant for approximately 84 of the grids and ea was dominant for approximately 16 of the grids mostly located in trm and tm 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties the presented results may unavoidably be associated with several uncertainties first errors between c et0 and l et0 may be attributed to the assumption that the six driving factors were independent of each other in the partial differential equation which was applied to ensure that each factor output represents its individual contribution zhang et al 2013 however ultimately these variables were not totally independent and therefore affected each other to a certain degree which led to some errors and uncertainties ning et al 2016 she et al 2017 in addition the partial derivatives of et0 to the six driving factors were not constant but fluctuated from 1961 to 2019 thus the contributions in equation 10 were calculated from the mean values of the partial derivatives during periods i and ii hence leading to uncertainties dong et al 2020a liu and zhang 2013 a possible physical reason for the uncertainty may be the presence of long term persistent ltp behaviour in literature the hurst kolmogorov dynamics term is used to express and simulate a more general behaviour of the geophysical processes extending from fine scale fractal structure to the large scale long term persistence dimitriadis and koutsoyiannis 2018 in fact there are global scale studies in literature which have traced the ltp behaviour in several of the processes affecting the et0 such as in temperature and wind koutsoyiannis et al 2018 and solar radiation koudouris et al 2018 in the presence of the ltp behaviour the variability of the et0 is expected to highly increase in comparison with a white noise and markov behaviours leading to a decrease in predictability of the et0 therefore the presence of long term persistent ltp behaviour may be a possible physical reason for high variability of et0 and may lead to uncertainty in et0 therefore such uncertainties and errors inevitably occur when calculating and attributing et0 however the calculated et0 trends fitted well with the detected et0 trends fig 5 which indicating that these uncertainties and errors did not substantially change the conclusions of this study substantially uncertainties regarding the evaluation of et0 based on the outputs of the gcms zhao et al 2020 persisted as many previous studies have identified the largest contributor to the uncertainty of climate projection and related impact studies is typically related to the choice of gcms owing to model structures kay et al 2009 knutti and sedlacek 2013 lin et al 2018 olesen et al 2007 to reduce such uncertainty as much as possible in this study we used the average output of the five gcms in the calculation 4 2 influence of wind speed in this study wind speed in china was found to have significantly decreased during period i and then recovered in recent years fig 3c a trend which has also been observed in other areas around the world such as italy iran south korea and the united states alayat et al 2018 keyhani et al 2010 kousari et al 2013 pirazzoli and tomasin 2003 furthermore from the results the trend of change in et0 during 1961 1992 was obviously dominated by the wind speed change across the entire country which is generally consistent with the findings of previous studies fan and thomas 2018 yin et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 yet during 1993 2019 the trend of change in et0 was dominated by tmax across the entire country and in four of the climatic zones sm tm tc and mp table 2 which somewhat contradicted the result that u2 was the dominant factor affecting the change in et0 at nearly half of the stations in the whole country and most of the stations in sm 34 of the stations tm 56 of the stations and tc 69 of the stations fig 6 the most likely main reason for this is that the contribution of u2 was offset by positive and negative effects owing to uneven directions of wind speed changes at different stations in the same area for example during period ii u2 showed an increasing trend at 401 stations and a decreasing trend at 394 stations the cause of the decrease in wind speed may be attributable to large scale changes in atmospheric circulations li et al 2018 roderick et al 2007 and further may be related to the increase in temperatures in land areas in recent decades such temperature increases may reduce the temperature and atmospheric pressure gradients between the land and adjacent oceans resulting in a decrease in wind speed gadgil 2007 guo et al 2011 on the other hand wind speed may also be increased by horizontal temperature gradients and thermal speed wind in the lower troposphere which have been found to result in deviations of surface wind from the large scale pressure gradient force effect owing to land cover and terrain heterogeneities guo et al 2011 4 3 responses to co2 and impacts on china the ipcc climate change 2014 synthesis report states that increasing atmospheric concentrations of co2 and other greenhouse gasses attributed largely to economic and population growth are extremely likely to be the dominant cause of the observed warming in recent decades pachauri and reisinger 2014 compared to findings in this study future tmax could be the absolute primary variable controlling et0 changes in china under the assumptions of the concentration driven emission scenarios table 3 which is also consistent with findings of previous research zhao et al 2020 moreover in addition to influencing climatic conditions directly through radiative forcing rising atmospheric co2 concentrations influence the climate system through its effects on the physiology of vegetation betts et al 2007 for example terrestrial vegetation takes up co2 through stomates in their leaves and simultaneously loses water to the atmosphere transpiration through the same pathway hence plants continuously adjust the widths of their stomatal apertures and their stomata generally open less widely under an increasing co2 concentration in this way increased atmospheric co2 concentrations allow plants to adjust the stomatal conductance and reduce transpiration a physiological response which results in more water at the land surface and increased soil moisture swann et al 2016 therefore stomatal resistance of leaves within the plants would increase under an elevated atmospheric co2 concentration and the increase of rs due to rising co2 levels would result in the decrease of et0 relatedly it may be that the water savings experienced by plants under increasing co2 could compensate for much of the effect of a warmer atmosphere potentially sufficiently to reduce drought some studies show that a future increase in evapotranspiration is projected for all parts of china huang et al 2017 li et al 2020 miao et al 2020 sheffield and wood 2007 wang et al 2014 which is consistent with the results in this study although precipitation would likely also increase in some regions such as sm wang et al 2014 yu et al 2017 the enhancement of et0 may be expected to outweigh that of precipitation particularly under the rcp8 5 scenario this is because the changes of future droughts may be largely influenced by the increase in et0 thus more intense dryness conditions are projected for china however climate models also predict an increased runoff over the twenty first century in china milly and dunne 2016 but this contradiction has been linked to the neglect of the impact of rising atmospheric co2 on plant water use as explained above therefore assessments of the effect of increased co2 conditions on the water cycle which only consider radiative forcing would be expected to overestimate future decreases in runoff and underestimate increases this implies that historical and future tendencies towards continental drying in china may be considerably weaker and less extensive than previously assumed under scenarios of future warmer atmosphere for example increased rs could contribute 42 5 to the et0 change under rcp8 5 scenario during 2040 2099 table 4 suggesting that the increasing trend of drought is nearly half as large as previously thought 5 conclusions in this study the spatial and temporal changes in et0 in china during 1961 2019 were investigated using a modified penman monteith formula considering the change of rs due to the alarming increase of co2 concentration based on the observed data of 795 meteorological stations a change point for the annual et0 series was identified in the year 1993 using cramer s test in which annual et0 had been decreasing significantly p 0 001 at a rate of 18 93 mm decade 1 during period i while annual et0 increased significantly p 0 05 at a rate of 11 19 mm decade 1 during period ii before 1993 tmax and ea decreased insignificantly p 0 05 while u2 and rs decreased significantly p 0 001 and tmin and rs increased significantly p 0 001 after 1993 tmax increased significantly p 0 01 while tmin and rs also increased significantly p 0 001 and ea increased insignificantly p 0 05 and rs decreased significantly p 0 05 while u2 decreased insignificantly p 0 05 meanwhile a partial differential method was used to attribute the change in et0 to climate variables and rs the proportional contribution of tmax tmin u2 rs ea and rs to the trend in et0 were 4 35 24 77 38 92 48 30 0 90 and 8 46 during period i respectively meaning that the negative effect of tmin had been offset by the positive effects of other driving factors which caused et0 to decrease the dominant factor influencing the decrease in et0 for trm and sm was rs and for tm and tc was decreasing u2 while the dominant factor influencing increasing et0 for mp was increasing tmin however the proportional contributions of tmax tmin rs u2 ea and rs to increased et0 were 81 17 62 24 15 27 4 39 34 30 and 19 42 respectively during period ii overall rapidly increasing tmax was the main reason for the increase in et0 in all five climatic zones of china while u2 was the dominant factor for the change in et0 at nearly half of the stations to predict the change in et0 in the future et0 was calculated under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios based on the average output of five gcms results showed that annual et0 increased at a rate of 1 49 and 16 05 mm decade 1 during 2040 2099 under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively and suggested that tmax would be the dominant factor impacting on changes to et0 in china for each climatic zone moreover increasing rs was thought to lead to a decrease in et0 and was an important influencing factor influencing change in et0 thus disregarding the increase of rs under an elevated concentration of co2 could result in the overestimation of et0 and result in similar circumstances to the current drying situation therefore the results of this study are significant for understanding the hydrological cycle and improving agricultural water management in china based on our findings an adaption of the rs value in the calculation of et0 using the fao penman monteith method to rising atmospheric co2 concentration should be considered for further research in order to obtain further meaningful assessments of the changes and impacts of aridity and drought credit authorship contribution statement yunpeng gui conceptualization methodology formal analysis

4468,reference evapotranspiration et0 is a key component of the water cycle in this study a modified penman monteith method incorporating the co2 effect on surface resistance was used to estimate past change in et0 in china for 1961 2019 and to project future changes for 2040 2099 a partial differential equation was used to attribute the changes in et0 results indicated the following 1 a shift point in the annual et0 series occurred in 1993 in which annual et0 in china had been decreasing and then increased significantly by 18 93 and 11 19 mm decade 1 before and after 1993 respectively with et0 having changed most drastically within the temperate continental climate zone 2 wind speed and solar radiation were the major dominant factors responsible for the change in et0 during 1961 1992 and their contribution rates were 48 30 and 38 92 respectively during 1993 2019 increasing maximum air temperature was the dominant factor contributing to increasing et0 with a contribution rate of 81 71 yet wind speed was the dominant factor affecting et0 changes at 45 of the stations in china 3 in future projections maximum air temperature is expected to be the dominant factor influencing the increase in et0 the values of which were projected at 1 49 and 16 05 mm decade 1 during 2040 2099 under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively with projections from five gcms the increasing surface resistance response to elevated co2 was found to be an important contributor to the decrease in et0 particularly for the rcp8 5 scenario the increase in surface resistance was found to lead to the decrease in et0 by 0 68 mm year 1 42 37 this suggests that historical and future tendencies towards aridity in china may be considerably weaker and less extensive than previously assumed keywords reference evapotranspiration attribution analysis surface resistance co2 climate change 1 introduction reference evapotranspiration et0 serves as one of the major components of the hydrological cycle and is an important indicator of global climate change han et al 2014 hupet and vanclooster 2001 sentelhas et al 2010 with increasing co2 and other heat trapping gases in the atmosphere the global mean surface temperature has risen by approximately 0 85 since the late 19th century stocker et al 2014 trenberth et al 2013 global warming is expected to increase et0 and accelerate hydrological cycles around the world fu et al 2013 jiang et al 2011 which is contradictory to the downward trend of et0 and or pan evaporation of the last few decades hence the concept of the evaporation paradox brutsaert and parlange 1998 hobbins et al 2004 the reasons for decreasing et0 and or pan evaporation have been widely discussed some researchers have revealed that the decreasing trend in et0 cannot solely consider the increase in air temperature this is because changes in et0 are also driven by other meteorological variables such as radiation vapor pressure ea and wind speed u2 generally decreasing et0 has been consistent with decreasing surface solar radiation rs over the same periods in various studies around the world some studies have reported that a decrease in rs was the main factor causing a decrease in et0 in ireland stanhill and möller 2008 and the yangtze river basin wang et al 2007 xu et al 2006 similarly the contribution of u2 changes to trends in et0 is an important aspect the decrease in the observed near surface wind speed is a global phenomenon mcvicar et al 2012 some researchers investigated that declining rates of u2 were the main factor contributing to decreasing et0 in many regions around the world such as canada burn and hesch 2007 australia roderick et al 2007 iran dinpashoh et al 2011 the tibetan plateau liu et al 2011 and the non monsoon region of china dong et al 2020b moreover ea plays a key role in the evaporation process and has been identified as the dominant factor influencing the decrease in et0 in limited regions tabari et al 2011 to determine et0 the penman monteith method which is recommended by the food and agricultural organization fao has been successfully used under different conditions and explicitly incorporates all the driving variables especially when sufficient meteorological data is available abdelhadi et al 2000 allen et al 1998 gavilan and castillo llanque 2009 goyal 2004 kang et al 2003 xu et al 2006 previous research on the factors affecting et0 change has mainly focused on climate factors without considering other variables such as surface resistance rs which is fixed at 70 s m 1 during the et0 calculation using the fao penman monteith equation however this equation only poorly simulates the effect of co2 concentration and many studies have shown that co2 concentration affects rs which in turn affects et0 ben hamouda and ventura 2020 long et al 2004 mall et al 2017 at present very few researchers have considered the variability of rs when estimating the et0 using the fao penman monteith equation and its attribution yet disregarding the increase in rs under changing concentrations of co2 results in the overestimation of the et0 milly and dunne 2016 roderick et al 2015 yang et al 2018b therefore incorporating the response of rs into an increasing concentration of co2 in the et0 estimation formula is necessary to obtain more accurate assessments of changes and impacts of et0 in relation to phenomena such as drought yang et al 2018b therefore in this study the fao penman monteith equation has been modified to account for the impact of atmospheric co2 concentration changes on r s moreover to characterize this effect when considering air temperature previous studies have rarely distinguished the effect of maximum tmax and minimum tmin air temperatures and have used instead average air temperature dong et al 2020b however related results have indicated that tmax and tmin vary according to different patterns and further that their respective contributions to et0 differ from each other li et al 2013 wu et al 2017 yin et al 2010 therefore in order to address all these factors in this study the contributions of the driving variables tmax tmin u2 rs ea and rs were quantitatively assessed to determine related changes in et0 different attribution analysis methods such as sensitivity analyses fan and thomas 2018 li et al 2017 sharifi and dinpashoh 2014 multiple regression analyses han et al 2018 li et al 2014 shan et al 2015 and partial differential methods roderick et al 2007 wang et al 2016 yang et al 2018a zheng et al 2009 have been used to quantify the contribution of driving factors to the change in et0 in previous studies of these sensitivity analyses have been used to determine the change rate of et0 in response to the change rate of meteorological factors huo et al 2013 while multiple regression analysis has been used to assess the relative contribution of change in the meteorological factor to the change in et0 pryor and ledolter 2010 typically a multiple regression analysis would be performed on a meteorological factor series to establish the multiple linear regression equation involving multiple independent variables however neither of these methods considers the evaporative process rather they consider only the variation of the results thus providing the relative contributions of meteorological variables without calculating the actual contributions to et0 and are therefore not ideal quantitative methods wang et al 2016 as an alternative approach the partial differential method has been widely used to attribute the change in pan evaporation liu and mcvicar 2012 wang et al 2015 and has also been widely used in attribution analyses for et0 in recent years dong et al 2020b ning et al 2016 based on a full physical formulation of et0 the partial differential method is able to calculate the actual contribution of each variable to et0 therefore in this study a detailed derivation process is provided to allow for the application of this differential equation method to the study of et0 in china the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the spatial and temporal variations of et0 and climate factors in china during 1961 2019 2 identify the contributions of climatic factors and rs to changes in et0 using the partial differential method and 3 predict the responses of et0 to climate change and its attribution during 2040 2099 under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios with projections from five global circulation models gcms the findings are expected to provide useful information for researchers and policymakers to assess impacts of the climate change and human activities on the hydrological cycle 2 methods and data 2 1 study area and data china can be divided into five climatic zones the tropical monsoon trm subtropical monsoon sm temperature monsoon tm temperate continental tc and mountain plateau mp climate zones fig 1 daily meteorological data

atmospheric concentrations of co2 from mauna loa represented the global co2 concentration changes in the ipcc reports pachauri and reisinger 2014 and were used to represent the co2 concentration

hempel et al 2013 with coverage for the period ranging from 2040 to 2099 2 2 research methods 2 2 1 calculation of et 0 the fao penman monteith equation has been widely used to calculate et0 allen et al 1998 in this equation rs is fixed at 70 s m 1 regardless of climate type and change in climate patterns and is represented by the value 0 34 in the denominator assuming that the rs is considered constant applies to a specific co2 concentration hence estimating a new rs value for elevated co2 concentration provides a method to estimate possible impacts of higher co2 on et0 ben hamouda and ventura 2020 thus the following form of the fao penman monteith equation was adopted 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 2 0 34 u 2 70 208 u 2 r s u 2 208 where et0 is the

kpa c 1 and rs is the surface resistance s m 1 because plant stomata generally open less widely under increased co2 concentration which increases rs field et al 1995 rs was calculated using the empirical function of the co2 concentration recommended by yang et al 2018b 3 r s 70 0 05 co 2 300 where rs is the surface resistance s m 1 and co2 is the concentration of co2 ppm net radiation was calculated via the following formulas using the observed sunshine hours maximum and minimum air temperatures data 4 r n r ns r nl 5 r n s 1 α r s 6 r s a s b s ssd n r a where α is the albedo of the

recommendation of the fao in this study rnl is estimated as 7 r nl δ t max k 4 t min k 4 2 0 34 0 14 ea 1 35 r s r so 0 35 8 r so 0 75 2 10 5 z r s where σ is the stefan boltzman constant 4 903 10 9mj

rs c u2 c ea and c rs are individual contributions to the long term trend in et0 due to the change in tmax tmin u2 rs ea and rs respectively the sum contributions of c tmax c tmin c rs c u2 c ea and c rs is simplified as c et0 then δ is the error item between the c et0 and et0 trend calculated by linear regression l et0 furthermore the individual relative contribution of each driving variable to the trend in et0 can be estimated as follows 12 rc x i c x i l e t 0 100 where rc xi is the relative contribution and xi is the driving variable 2 2 3 trend and abrupt change analysis sen s method sen 1968 was used to estimate the magnitudes of trends in et0 and six driving factors in this study sen s slope estimator β can be calculated as follows 13 β m e d i a n x j x k j k 1 k j where xj and xk are the data value at times j and k respectively a positive β indicates an upward trend in the time series while a negative β indicates a downward trend the mann kendall mk test has widely been used to identify the significance of hydrologic and climatic trends ding et al 2019 han et al 2018 in this study the mk test was used to identify the significance of et0 with each of the six driving factors series in this method the test statistic z is estimated as follows 14 z s 1 σ s 2 0 s 1 σ s 2 if if if s 0 s 0 s 0 15 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i 16 sgn x 1 0 1 if if if x j x i x j x i x j

given time the null hypothesis h0 indicates non significance and is accepted if the statistic z is not statistically significant i e z z1 a 2 in which z1 a 2 are the standard normal deviates positive z indicates an upward trend in the time series while negative z indicates a downward trend finally cramer s test zhang et al 2013 has widely been used to detect the change points of hydrological and meteorological series in this study cramer s test was used to detect the change points of et0 series during 1961 2019 3 results 3 1 change in et0 fig 2 a and 2b show the variation of annual et0 in china from 1961 and 2019 and the results of the cramer s test for identifying the shift point of annual long term et0 series respectively a turning point in annual et0 series was detected around the year 1993 fig 2b hence we further divided the study duration from 1961 to 2019 into two periods 1961 1992 period i and 1993 2019 period ii annual et0 decreased significantly p 0 001 by 18 93 mm decade 1 during period i then increased significantly p 0 05 by 11 19 mm decade 1 during period ii table 1 for the five climatic zones before 1993 annual et0 decreased significantly p 0 001 in sm tm and tc respectively and decreased insignificantly p 0 05 in trm yet increased insignificantly p 0 05 in mp after 1993 annual et0 increased significantly p 0 001 in mp and sm and increased insignificantly p 0 05 in trm tm and tc respectively fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of trends in annual et0 at the 795 meteorological stations before and after 1993 during period i annual et0 decreased at 653 stations 82 14 and decreasing trends were significant p 0 05 at 401 stations 50 44 during period ii annual et0 increased at 533 stations 69 56 and increasing trends were significant p 0 05 at 235 stations 29 56 3 2 changes in driving factors because change in et0 is known to result from the combined effect of climatic factors and other variables such as tmax tmin rs u2 ea and rs the analysis of each driving factor before and after 1993 is essential fig 4 shows the variation of five climate variables and rs in china from 1961 and 2019 tmax decreased insignificantly p 0 05 at rate of 0 02 decade 1 before 1993 then increased significantly p 0 01 at rate of 0 42 decade 1 for the china average a similar trend in tmax was observed for sm while the other four climatic zones exhibited an increasing trend in tmax during period i for the china average tmin increased significantly p 0 001 by 0 23 and 0 33 decade 1 before and after 1993 similar trends in tmax were also observed in all five climatic zones except in tm the increasing trend in tmax during period i was lower than that during period ii before 1993 u2 decreased dramatically p 0 001 by 0 11 m s 1 decade 1 and for the china average during period ii an insignificantly p 0 05 slight declining trend was observed at a rate of 0 01 m s 1 decade 1 this change in u2 was spatially uneven in that the decreasing trends in u2 slowed in trm and tm but showed a recovery in sm and tc following 1993 during period i rs showed a significantly p 0 001 declining trend with a rate of 0 22 mj m 2 day 1 decade 1 while for the china average during period ii rs decreased significantly p 0 05 with significantly lower amplitude trends of 0 06 mj m 2 day 1 this rs reduction was largely in trm sm and tm before 1993 with the main reason likely being related to the rapid increase of aerosols accompanied with urbanization in those areas zhang et al 2010 during period i ea did not show a change trend but a slightly upward trend by 0 01 kpa decade 1 during period ii was observed for the china average rs exhibited dramatically p 0 001 increasing trends during periods i and ii at rates of 0 66 s m 1 and 1 03 s m 1 decade 1 respectively 3 3 contributions of changes in driving variables to et0 the contributions of the six driving variables to the change in annual et0 were estimated according to equation 10 and 11 as shown in fig 5 the calculated et0 trends c et0 fitted well with the detected et0 trends l et0 by linear regression with r2 0 92 by comparing all stations in china during the two periods indicating the suitability of using the partial differential method to attribute the changes in et0 the contribution of the six driving factors on et0 rate are shown in table 2 during period i the changes in tmax tmin rs u2 ea and rs were found to have led to change in et0 by 0 08 0 47 0 74 0 91 0 02 and 0 16 mm year 1 respectively with corresponding contribution percentages of 4 35 24 77 38 92 48 30 0 90 and 8 46 the combined effects of the six driving factors resulted in a decrease in et0 by 1 44 mm year 1 the increasing tmin was found to have led to an increase in et0 while during period i the effect was offset by the changing tmax rs u2 ea and rs during period ii the change in tmax tmin rs u2 ea and rs were found to have led to the change in et0 by 0 91 0 70 0 17 0 05 0 38 and 0 22 mm year 1 respectively with corresponding contribution percentages of 81 71 62 24 15 27 4 39 34 30 and 19 42 this result indicated that temperature was the dominant factor affecting et0 which is consistent with the findings of a recent study by tegos et al 2017 during period ii the positive effects of tmax tmin and u2 offset the influence of rs ea and rs which caused an increase in et0 overall the combined effects of the six driving factors resulted in an increase in et0 by 0 89 mm year 1 within the five climatic regions during period i decreasing rs was the dominant factor influencing the decrease of et0 in trm and sm and decreasing u2 was the dominant factor influencing the decrease of et0 in tm and tc while increasing tmin was the dominant factor influencing the increase of et0 in mp during period ii increasing tmin was the dominant factor influencing the increase of et0 in trm while increasing tmax was the dominant factor influencing the increase of et0 in the other four climatic zones fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of dominant driving variables for the change in et0 at all 795 stations in china during periods i and ii before 1993 rs and u2 were the dominant factors for the et0 change at approximately 33 and 36 of the stations respectively whereas tmax tmin and ea were the dominant factors at approximately 8 14 and 9 of the stations respectively spatially rs was the dominant factor at most stations in sm while u2 was the dominant factor in tm and tc after 1993 u2 became the dominant factor for the change in et0 at approximately 45 of the stations in china and was also the dominant factor at most stations in sm tm and tc tmax was the dominant factor at approximately 21 of the stations mostly located in tm lastly ea tmin and rs were the dominant factors at approximately 15 10 and 9 of the stations respectively 3 4 future change in et0 and driving factors to predict et0 trends for the future the change in et0 was estimated for the period ranging from 2040 to 2099 using the modified penman monteith formula based on the average output of five gcms under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios table 3 shows the trends of annual et0 and six driving factors from 2040 to 2099 under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios according to the results annual et0 could increase insignificantly p 0 05 by 1 49 mm decade 1 under the rcp4 5 scenario for the china average while et0 could increase significantly p 0 001 by 16 05 mm decade 1 under the rcp8 5 scenario similar trends in et0 were also observed in the five climatic zones and for tc the increasing trend in et0 under the rcp8 5 scenario would be approximately 18 times as that under the rcp4 5 scenario both tmax and tmin could increase insignificantly p 0 05 under the rcp4 5 scenario and could increase significantly p 0 001 under the rcp8 5 scenario respectively rs could increase significantly p 0 001 under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively whereas u2 could decrease significantly p 0 001 under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively it was found that ea could increase significantly p 0 01 under the rcp4 5 scenario and could increase significantly p 0 001 under the rcp8 5 scenario finally rs could increase significantly p 0 001 under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively 3 5 contributions of future driving variables to changes in et0 table 4 shows the estimated contributions of the driving factors to the future predicted change in et0 during 2040 2099 obtained by the product of the partial derivatives and the change rate of the six factors based on the average output of the five gcms under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios results show that the changes in tmax tmin rs u2 ea and rs could lead to a change in et0 by 0 27 0 14 0 09 0 11 0 19 and 0 12 mm year 1 respectively under the rcp4 5 scenario and by 2 59 1 33 0 08 0 08 2 01 and 0 68 mm year 1 respectively under the rcp8 5 scenario for both scenarios increasing tmax tmin and rs could lead to the increase in et0 and would offset the negative effects of u2 ea and rs to et0 for all five climatic zones under both scenarios increasing tmax was expected to be the dominant factor influencing the increase in et0 fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of the dominant driving variables for the change in et0 at 3834 grids in china during 2040 2099 under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios under the rcp4 5 scenario tmax was the dominant factor influencing approximately 68 of the grids whereas tmin ea and rs were the dominant factors influencing approximately 8 8 and 2 of the grids respectively rs was dominant influencing approximately 5 of the grids mostly located in sm while u2 was dominant for approximately 8 of the grids mostly located in sm and tm under the rcp8 5 scenario tmax was dominant for approximately 84 of the grids and ea was dominant for approximately 16 of the grids mostly located in trm and tm 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties the presented results may unavoidably be associated with several uncertainties first errors between c et0 and l et0 may be attributed to the assumption that the six driving factors were independent of each other in the partial differential equation which was applied to ensure that each factor output represents its individual contribution zhang et al 2013 however ultimately these variables were not totally independent and therefore affected each other to a certain degree which led to some errors and uncertainties ning et al 2016 she et al 2017 in addition the partial derivatives of et0 to the six driving factors were not constant but fluctuated from 1961 to 2019 thus the contributions in equation 10 were calculated from the mean values of the partial derivatives during periods i and ii hence leading to uncertainties dong et al 2020a liu and zhang 2013 a possible physical reason for the uncertainty may be the presence of long term persistent ltp behaviour in literature the hurst kolmogorov dynamics term is used to express and simulate a more general behaviour of the geophysical processes extending from fine scale fractal structure to the large scale long term persistence dimitriadis and koutsoyiannis 2018 in fact there are global scale studies in literature which have traced the ltp behaviour in several of the processes affecting the et0 such as in temperature and wind koutsoyiannis et al 2018 and solar radiation koudouris et al 2018 in the presence of the ltp behaviour the variability of the et0 is expected to highly increase in comparison with a white noise and markov behaviours leading to a decrease in predictability of the et0 therefore the presence of long term persistent ltp behaviour may be a possible physical reason for high variability of et0 and may lead to uncertainty in et0 therefore such uncertainties and errors inevitably occur when calculating and attributing et0 however the calculated et0 trends fitted well with the detected et0 trends fig 5 which indicating that these uncertainties and errors did not substantially change the conclusions of this study substantially uncertainties regarding the evaluation of et0 based on the outputs of the gcms zhao et al 2020 persisted as many previous studies have identified the largest contributor to the uncertainty of climate projection and related impact studies is typically related to the choice of gcms owing to model structures kay et al 2009 knutti and sedlacek 2013 lin et al 2018 olesen et al 2007 to reduce such uncertainty as much as possible in this study we used the average output of the five gcms in the calculation 4 2 influence of wind speed in this study wind speed in china was found to have significantly decreased during period i and then recovered in recent years fig 3c a trend which has also been observed in other areas around the world such as italy iran south korea and the united states alayat et al 2018 keyhani et al 2010 kousari et al 2013 pirazzoli and tomasin 2003 furthermore from the results the trend of change in et0 during 1961 1992 was obviously dominated by the wind speed change across the entire country which is generally consistent with the findings of previous studies fan and thomas 2018 yin et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 yet during 1993 2019 the trend of change in et0 was dominated by tmax across the entire country and in four of the climatic zones sm tm tc and mp table 2 which somewhat contradicted the result that u2 was the dominant factor affecting the change in et0 at nearly half of the stations in the whole country and most of the stations in sm 34 of the stations tm 56 of the stations and tc 69 of the stations fig 6 the most likely main reason for this is that the contribution of u2 was offset by positive and negative effects owing to uneven directions of wind speed changes at different stations in the same area for example during period ii u2 showed an increasing trend at 401 stations and a decreasing trend at 394 stations the cause of the decrease in wind speed may be attributable to large scale changes in atmospheric circulations li et al 2018 roderick et al 2007 and further may be related to the increase in temperatures in land areas in recent decades such temperature increases may reduce the temperature and atmospheric pressure gradients between the land and adjacent oceans resulting in a decrease in wind speed gadgil 2007 guo et al 2011 on the other hand wind speed may also be increased by horizontal temperature gradients and thermal speed wind in the lower troposphere which have been found to result in deviations of surface wind from the large scale pressure gradient force effect owing to land cover and terrain heterogeneities guo et al 2011 4 3 responses to co2 and impacts on china the ipcc climate change 2014 synthesis report states that increasing atmospheric concentrations of co2 and other greenhouse gasses attributed largely to economic and population growth are extremely likely to be the dominant cause of the observed warming in recent decades pachauri and reisinger 2014 compared to findings in this study future tmax could be the absolute primary variable controlling et0 changes in china under the assumptions of the concentration driven emission scenarios table 3 which is also consistent with findings of previous research zhao et al 2020 moreover in addition to influencing climatic conditions directly through radiative forcing rising atmospheric co2 concentrations influence the climate system through its effects on the physiology of vegetation betts et al 2007 for example terrestrial vegetation takes up co2 through stomates in their leaves and simultaneously loses water to the atmosphere transpiration through the same pathway hence plants continuously adjust the widths of their stomatal apertures and their stomata generally open less widely under an increasing co2 concentration in this way increased atmospheric co2 concentrations allow plants to adjust the stomatal conductance and reduce transpiration a physiological response which results in more water at the land surface and increased soil moisture swann et al 2016 therefore stomatal resistance of leaves within the plants would increase under an elevated atmospheric co2 concentration and the increase of rs due to rising co2 levels would result in the decrease of et0 relatedly it may be that the water savings experienced by plants under increasing co2 could compensate for much of the effect of a warmer atmosphere potentially sufficiently to reduce drought some studies show that a future increase in evapotranspiration is projected for all parts of china huang et al 2017 li et al 2020 miao et al 2020 sheffield and wood 2007 wang et al 2014 which is consistent with the results in this study although precipitation would likely also increase in some regions such as sm wang et al 2014 yu et al 2017 the enhancement of et0 may be expected to outweigh that of precipitation particularly under the rcp8 5 scenario this is because the changes of future droughts may be largely influenced by the increase in et0 thus more intense dryness conditions are projected for china however climate models also predict an increased runoff over the twenty first century in china milly and dunne 2016 but this contradiction has been linked to the neglect of the impact of rising atmospheric co2 on plant water use as explained above therefore assessments of the effect of increased co2 conditions on the water cycle which only consider radiative forcing would be expected to overestimate future decreases in runoff and underestimate increases this implies that historical and future tendencies towards continental drying in china may be considerably weaker and less extensive than previously assumed under scenarios of future warmer atmosphere for example increased rs could contribute 42 5 to the et0 change under rcp8 5 scenario during 2040 2099 table 4 suggesting that the increasing trend of drought is nearly half as large as previously thought 5 conclusions in this study the spatial and temporal changes in et0 in china during 1961 2019 were investigated using a modified penman monteith formula considering the change of rs due to the alarming increase of co2 concentration based on the observed data of 795 meteorological stations a change point for the annual et0 series was identified in the year 1993 using cramer s test in which annual et0 had been decreasing significantly p 0 001 at a rate of 18 93 mm decade 1 during period i while annual et0 increased significantly p 0 05 at a rate of 11 19 mm decade 1 during period ii before 1993 tmax and ea decreased insignificantly p 0 05 while u2 and rs decreased significantly p 0 001 and tmin and rs increased significantly p 0 001 after 1993 tmax increased significantly p 0 01 while tmin and rs also increased significantly p 0 001 and ea increased insignificantly p 0 05 and rs decreased significantly p 0 05 while u2 decreased insignificantly p 0 05 meanwhile a partial differential method was used to attribute the change in et0 to climate variables and rs the proportional contribution of tmax tmin u2 rs ea and rs to the trend in et0 were 4 35 24 77 38 92 48 30 0 90 and 8 46 during period i respectively meaning that the negative effect of tmin had been offset by the positive effects of other driving factors which caused et0 to decrease the dominant factor influencing the decrease in et0 for trm and sm was rs and for tm and tc was decreasing u2 while the dominant factor influencing increasing et0 for mp was increasing tmin however the proportional contributions of tmax tmin rs u2 ea and rs to increased et0 were 81 17 62 24 15 27 4 39 34 30 and 19 42 respectively during period ii overall rapidly increasing tmax was the main reason for the increase in et0 in all five climatic zones of china while u2 was the dominant factor for the change in et0 at nearly half of the stations to predict the change in et0 in the future et0 was calculated under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios based on the average output of five gcms results showed that annual et0 increased at a rate of 1 49 and 16 05 mm decade 1 during 2040 2099 under rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively and suggested that tmax would be the dominant factor impacting on changes to et0 in china for each climatic zone moreover increasing rs was thought to lead to a decrease in et0 and was an important influencing factor influencing change in et0 thus disregarding the increase of rs under an elevated concentration of co2 could result in the overestimation of et0 and result in similar circumstances to the current drying situation therefore the results of this study are significant for understanding the hydrological cycle and improving agricultural water management in china based on our findings an adaption of the rs value in the calculation of et0 using the fao penman monteith method to rising atmospheric co2 concentration should be considered for further research

4469,in most coastal alluvial plains the groundwater area of the aquifer is a rich environment that has experienced an extended period of marine deposition and is highly vulnerable to increasing urbanization excessive exploitation of groundwater has resulted in recent seawater intrusion and connate water leakage leading to freshwater salinization in this study a novel workflow is designed for groundwater appraisal first revised one dimensional direct transformation schemes were developed and applied to extensive vertical electrical sounding ves points sampled by a schlumberger array to obtain the ves based calibrated transformed resistivity v ctr as calibrated by the modified reflection coefficient and novel depth correction factor next the interfaces of all leaky confined aquifers lcas and the saline water zone were quantitatively determined via hybrid interpretation methods finally to better understand the salt level i e fresh brackish or saline and perform assessments of the groundwater quality total dissolved solids tds planar distributions were interpolated using two different power functions linking the v ctr and measured tds from the sampled boreholes for the corresponding aquifer unit the workflow was examined based on hydrological and geophysical data acquired at the yangtze river delta nantong region jiangsu province china the interpreted results are of great significance for understanding the groundwater distribution associated with the quaternary geology and hydrogeology and can be potentially used to analyze and guide the development and utilization of water resources in the study area keywords groundwater quality division vertical electrical sounding ves total dissolved solids tds fresh saline water interface coastal area china 1 introduction freshwater is one of the most important natural resources for meeting the basic living needs of humans in recent decades especially in heavily populated coastal areas rapid population growth has aggravated the shortage of water resources and enhanced the importance of existing water resources and their quality coastal plains are located in the land and ocean interaction zone mostly defined as alluvial plains formed by the interactions between rivers and oceans where loose sedimentary layers are widely distributed the underground contains abundant pore water in loose rock in which a certain amount of connate water may be stored owing to the rise and fall of sea level in the quaternary period forming the hydro chemical condition of the coexistence of fresh saline water excessive and blind exploitation of groundwater results in the formation of a regional depression cone which has led to recent seawater intrusion and connate water leakage resulting in hybrid salinization sun et al 2019 that has produced freshwater salinization recent seawater intrusion for example usually occurs near the coastline where the pressure of freshwater decrease to below that of sea water when the groundwater level drops and sea water begins to intrude inland leading to the salinization of shallow aquifers gimenez forcada 2014 amiri et al 2016 in contrast connate water leakage generally occurs in inland areas where the depression cone allows connate water located on top of freshwater to recharge the deep freshwater layer throughout the aquitard i e especially for a thin aquitard under hydrodynamic drive leading to increased salinity in the deep aquifer han et al 2012 in rare cases groundwater salinization can be caused by water rock interaction dissolution from evaporated salt deposits in some coastal plains gosselin et al 2004 moussa et al 2011 meng et al 2019 groundwater salinization is a common problem in coastal areas as well as a focus in the hydrogeological community for decades therefore adequately understanding the current spatial distribution of groundwater e g including the fresh saline water interfaces and its quality e g salinity within aquifers and the formation mechanism is essential for the effective prevention for the salinization of freshwater and rational improvements to the use of groundwater with varying quality traditional surveys that interpret the distribution and quality of groundwater are usually carried out by analyzing boreholes at limited points to obtain hydro chemical implications wu et al 2008 rasmussen et al 2013 joung and shiller 2014 however most of the applications mentioned above exhibit the main disadvantage of sparse point locations resulting in the inaccurate estimation of hydrological information between any two wells to overcome this problem previous studies have preferred to use remote geophysical technology which is advantageous owing to its optimal costs in situ detection non destructive quality and sufficient density of data points several studies have successfully identified coastal aquifer structures and dynamics by combining the seismic refraction method and borehole data analysis crimes et al 1994 burschil et al 2012 kwong et al 2016 abelson et al 2018 however owing to weak velocity and density contrasts seismic technology is rarely used to identify the interface of saline water zone and assess groundwater quality for which the ability to split groundwater by salinity is a prerequisite based on another physical property of rocks fresh and saline aquifers have a capacity to carry a current or what is commonly referred to as resistance which can be used to distinguish the groundwater distribution quality and the lithology in early exploration stages the estimation of the aquifer distribution based on an airborne electromagnetic survey configuration has been an active research area for large exploration coast area across a specific time el kaliouby and abdalla 2015 el kaliouby 2020 or frequency domain supper et al 2009 suzuki et al 2017 as another effective ground based geoelectric resistivity approach the vertical electrical sounding ves survey is especially suitable for the delineation of the groundwater distribution and interface between fresh and saline zone in coastal plains shaaban 2001 corriols et al 2009 bouderbala et al 2016 hasan et al 2019 the characterization of an aquifer and or groundwater appraisal using ves data collected by a schlumberger array are usually presented in the form of a corresponding resistivity model especially for alluvial fields ibe and uzoukwu 2001 perttu et al 2011 maiti et al 2013 kasprzak et al 2017 limited ves data has been widely employed in numerous studies on coastal areas to delineate the top and bottom boundaries of the low resistivity layer which is recovered by iterative inversion based on a one dimensional layered model as the fresh saline water interface ginzburg and levanon 1976 batayneh 2006 srinivas et al 2012 however h shaped curves which are common in coastal areas will result in an s equivalence phenomena and affect the results of iterative inversion leading to thickness instability of the low resistivity layer alvarez et al 2008 in contrast when the number of ves points is relatively small fine inversion is applicable however iterative inversion will become time consuming and unstable with a significant increase in the number of ves points ruan 1996 converted ves data using logarithm and derivative transformations to ensure the stability and unity of the solution nevertheless this method results in a discrepancy with respect to the descending branch of the ves curve total dissolved solids tds is an effective parameter to characterize groundwater quality which can be used to represent the total organic matter content dominated by salinity taking advantage of the resistivity to characterize the tds for surface water appraisal is highly convenient chang et al 1983 attempted to establish a relationship between well based tds and pore water resistivity to evaluate groundwater quality however directly measuring the pore water resistivity in the field is difficult alternatively the plane distribution of water quality is usually based on the interpolated original apparent resistivity and measured tds asfahani and abou zakhem 2013 demonstrated a good agreement between low resistivity areas in the original apparent resistivity plan distribution and tds planar interpolation results the dar zarrouk parameter introduced for describing the relationship between transversal unit resistance and longitudinal unit conductance was successfully used to determine the extent of saline water intrusion in coastal areas associated with tds data khalil 2006 george et al 2015 hasan et al 2019 however these studies only provide the overall characteristics of fresh saline water with neither using electric logging data for correction nor do they correspond to the aquifer system as determined by the hydrogeological borehole in other words to date negligible research has focused on linking hydrogeological information with the tds for comprehensive interpretations and applications therefore this is not an appropriate technique to describe the groundwater quality distribution within different aquifer systems resulting from transgression during different periods in this study we introduce a novel hybrid data processing hydrology and geophysics and interpretation workflow where the fresh saline water zone is quantitatively identified and the tds spatial distribution is determined under the condition of the hydrological system first extensive ves data were implemented by transforming the measured apparent resistivity to a calibrated transformed resistivity v ctr using a modified reflection coefficient and novel depth correction factor associated with electrical logging resistivity second the spatial boundaries of all lcas were determined in terms of the interpolation of the borehole based hydrogeological zonation meanwhile the spatial interfaces top and bottom of the saline water zone were confirmed with reference to the novel ves based calibrated transformed resistivity inflection v bi points approach using the ves data and well based inflection w bi point method using the electrical logging resistivity data both inflection methods can be used under the condition of a large existing resistivity contrast finally from a groundwater quality appraisal perspective we also developed a mathematical model to construct a power function relationship between v ctr and tds to estimate and achieve the tds spatial distribution within corresponding different aquifers between boreholes the new methods and workflow were illustrated by a case study in the nantong region jiangsu province china we speculate that the novel approaches and workflow product can provide comprehensive and quantitative interpretations for the analysis of coastal plain groundwater systematics and are more suitable for use in areas with similar geological conditions worldwide 2 hydrogeological environment 2 1 geographic setting the nantong survey area is located in the east central part of jiangsu province in the northern wing of the yangtze river delta which faces the yellow sea to the east and the yangtze river to the south near the river mouth ranging from 31 50 32 10 n and 120 45 122 00 e with an area of 3 550 km2 fig 1 the survey area near low level coastal areas elevation of 3 5 m is slightly higher in the northwest and then gradually inclines from the west to the east the surface drainage system is well developed with crisscrossing rivers while the groundwater table ranges from 1 2 to 1 6 m there are four types of landforms in the region denuded inselberg the yangtze river delta plain littoral sea amasses plain and man made landform the denuded inselberg are only distributed in the southern region of the survey area consisting of silurian and devonian quartz sandstones red color in fig 2 the yangtze river delta plain formed from sedimentary accumulation throughout the past 1 000 2 000 years colors in the middle column of the legend in fig 2 the sand ridges light yellow in fig 2 are linearly distributed from the east to the west the ground elevation ranges from 3 5

the surface sediments are mainly clayey silt silty clay muddy silt and muddy clay most of the man made landforms gray in fig 2 are near the coastal area bordered by the eastern sea wall they are used for industrial aquaculture 2 2 hydrology 2 2 1 hydrological system fig 3 shows an example of a typical borehole w23 in the study area displaying the water bearing rocks and their corresponding stratigraphic age as well as the sedimentary facies lithology tds and electrical characteristics the pore aquifers in loose rocks are closely related to the change in the river sea and paleogeographic environment characterized by significant layering the aquifers can be divided into phreatic aquifer and four lcas i e water bearing rock according to their stratigraphic ages lca iv group is neogene n multi story channel deposits with a locally distributed alluvial conglomeratic clay layer the aquifer layer is dominated by medium coarse sand and medium fine sands the aquitard is characterized by floodplain clayey soil with a generally high clay content lca iii group is lower pleistocene qp1 multi period estuary with superimposed streams the aquifer layer is dominated by coarse middle coarse grain pebbly sands and the aquitard is widely distributed floodplain clayey soil lca ii group is middle pleistocene qp2 multi stage estuary with superimposed streams the aquifer layer consists of fining upward sands from coarse to fine grain the aquitard is dominated by floodplain clayey soil lca i group consists of upper pleistocene qp3 channel estuarine shallow marine deposits the aquifer layer has different sands from various facies including thick fluvial channel sands ranging from coarse to fine grained estuarine deltaic and shoreface fine grain sands interbedded by a thin clay layer the aquitard is defined as the clay layer mainly deposited in holocene qh shallow marine lagoon tidal flat and deltaic facies the phreatic aquifer group is dominated by holocene qh deltaic sands 2 2 2 aquifer water quality and electrical properties since the quaternary the study area has experienced seven major transgressions brine was formed by the mixing of seawater and pore water in sands freshwater can only be preserved in aquifer sands where seawater is not in direct contact the groundwater quality is mainly affected by the range and intensity of multiple transgressions but it is also affected by late precipitation surface water infiltration desalination and human activities which renders the groundwater quality characteristics as increasingly complex lca iii as the main production strata is dominated by drinkable freshwater tds 1 g l with a high resistivity due to the thick and coarse grained sands lca iv mainly consists of freshwater 1 g l tds 3 g l where the electrical logs show a lower resistivity than the lca iii aquifer due to both high clay content and tds lca i and ii mainly consist of brackish and saline water with tds values of more than 3 g l up to 20 g l where the resistivity is low the phreatic aquifer is a transgressive section which is dominantly saline water however owing to the infiltration and recharge of freshwater i e surface water the groundwater quality has been noticeably desalinated forming a shallow desalination zone of approximately 10 m the electric logging shows that the shallow resistance increases rapidly after the low resistivity which represents the saline water region 3 datasets and workflow 3 1 datasets and configuration fig 4 shows that there are a total of 107 geologically stratified hydrogeological zonation boreholes marked as empty diamonds where the electrical logging resistivity was recorded in 26 boreholes marked as solid diamonds with tds data for 91 of the boreholes marked as magenta pluses the

identification the interfaces of fresh saline water fig 6b definition the boundaries of lcas fig 6c and water quality appraisal fig 6d respectively more detail information about these aspects is presented in the next three sections i e section3 2 1 section 3 2 2 and section 3 2 3 to better stand out the main contributions mentioned in the introdcution section we marked them all with solid yellow circles and would like to convey to readers the idea of integration of multiple datasets during the workflow 3 2 1 calibrated transformation resistivity v ctr the resistivity and thickness of each layer can be directly calculated using the following pseudocode combining the transformation formula originally derived by ruan 1996 for the first layer i 1 as follows 1 ρ i ρ 1 ρ s 1 a n d 2 h i h 1 r 1 for the 2nd 3rd nth layer i 2 3 n we obtained the following 3 ρ i ρ s i ρ s i 1 1 k i 1 k i a n d 4 h i r i r i 1 1 k 2 i where ρ i is the transformed resistivity of the i th layer ρ s i is the measured apparent resistivity of the i th electrode spacing h i is the calculated thickness of the i th layer and r i is the i th a b 2 electrode spacing the parameter k i is defined as the reflection coefficient of the i th layer representing the slope of the electrical sounding curve from the i 1 th to the i th electrode spacing in the double logarithmic coordinates as follows 5 k i log ρ s i log ρ s i 1 log r i log r i 1 however the curve derived from eqs 3 and 4 did not fit well with the descending branch of electric logging resistivity to improve the fit we merged the reflection coefficient k i proposed by shaoqiu 1993 into eqs 3 and 4 where k i was be replaced by k i therefore we rewrote eqs 3 and 4 as follows 6 ρ i ρ s i ρ s i 1 1 k i 1 k i a n d 7 h i r i r i 1 1 k 2 i where k i was expressed as follows 8 k i k i 1 k i 1 05 1 k i k 2 i k i 0 k i k i 0 where ρ i is referred to as the modified transformed resistivity of the i th layer and h i is the calculated thickness of the i th layer as calibrated by k i the modified transformed resistivity v mtr ρ i is denoted by the red dashed line in fig 7 a which overlaps with the electric logging resistivity solid black line measured apparent resistivity solid light blue line and transformed resistivity ρ i dark blue dashed line first the curves of the measured apparent resistivity and electric logging resistivity which vary with depth have notable differences in their trends compared with the transformed resistivity the curve of the v mtr is more consistent with the electric logging resistivity curve at the near surface fig 7b however the v mtr curve is characterized by an improper fit apparent discrepancies as the transformed resistivity at deeper depths fig 7a to solve this problem referring to the hydrogeological zonation we introduced a novel depth correction factor α which was estimated based on the ratio of the two depth inflection points from each available borehole one point was selected from the v mtr curve and another was selected from the electrical logging resistivity curve the main criterion used to select the two inflection points on the two corresponding resistivity curves was based on where the rate of change was most notable where resistivity starts to raise from small to large which represents the interface of fresh and saline water discussed in more detail in section 3 2 2 we named the v mtr as calibrated by α as v ctr fig 7 shows the variation trend along the v ctr curve solid red line with depth which captured the main characteristics of the electrical logging resistivity curve both near the surface mainly fig 7b and at the depths around lca iii basically where the v ctr amplitude is almost 50 lower than the electric logging resistivity fig 7a fig 8 compares the v ctr solid red line and electric logging resistivity curves solid black within 12 boreholes arranged in a west east direction forming three invisible configuration lines from north to south as shown fig 4 subsequently the remaining v mtr data were calibrated with the corresponding α which is shown on contour map fig 9 as well as to generate the spatial distribution of the v ctr 3 2 2 identification of boundaries aquifers and saline water zone to establish the spatial interfaces in hydrogeological zonations and fresh saline water we further comprehensively inferred their tops and bottoms using the v ctr electrical logging resistivity and the hydrogeological zonations acquired from all available boreholes table 1 lists the different types of definitions and interpretations for the top and bottom interfaces of each aquifer and the saline water zone for phreatic aquifer four lcas and bedrock groups from both the top and bottom interfaces except for bedrock top were determined by directly employing hydrogeological zonation information at the corresponding zonation in the boreholes from the study area the top interface of the phreatic group as an exceptional case was marked by default by the ground surface the spatial top and bottom interfaces were then interpolated by the kriging method which yields the best linear unbiased prediction of the intermediate depth values by computing a weighted average of the known corresponding values in the neighborhood of the borehole points williams 1998 koziel and bandler 2012 we note that carrying out the kriging interpolation method to delineate the interfaces of the phreatic layer and lcas especially to characterize the aquitard fig 3 from them is more acceptable than employing the resistivity contrast owing to the weak resistivity contrast however due to depth limitations of the acquirement the depth of the effective hydrogeological zonation data was approximately up to 300 m at their deepest point where the depth of the bed rock top interface usually cannot be covered in most boreholes therefore taking advantage of the v ctr contrast is an effective method to demarcate the top interfaces of bed rock by resistivity contrast at deeper depths fig 10 furthermore three v ctr vertical sections were established along each survey line i e l17 fig 10a1 l40 fig 10b1 and l48 fig 10c1 in the western central and eastern regions of the study area respectively the boundaries of the hydrogeological zonation and interfaces of the saline water region are shown in fig 10a2 10b2 and 10c2 we integrated the resistivity v ctr and electric logging resistivity with the hydrogeological systems delineating the saline water zone interfaces and their relationship with the aquifers on this basis in practice a sharp boundary between saline and freshwater does not exist however the state of the gradual transition zone can be basically presented but the gradient of the transition zone varies for different aquifers based on fig 8 there are substantial changes in both the low resistivity i e v ctr and electric logging resistivity in the middle and high resistivity in the upper and lower parts therefore the transition zone between saline and freshwater was simplified as a line in the study area for saline water region demarcation the upper sub zone with a high resistivity 5 30 ω m indicates a shallow desalination zone dominated by freshwater while the lower sub zone is basically filled with saline water with a low resistivity 6 ω m therefore the interpolated phreatic aquifer group at the borehole location was divided into two sub zones based on the top boundary pink solid line in fig 8 of the saline region which was identified with the w bi points fig 8a1 b1 and c1 next the spatial top boundary distribution of the saline region between the boreholes was obtained using v bi points interpolation fig 10a1 10b1 and 10c1 both the w bi and v bi points were selected based on the rate of the change in the electric logging resistivity and v crt curve respectively which was most notable during the dropping process from near the surface we also note that a sudden increase both in the v ctr and electrical logging resistivity values can be observed in range of depth mostly approaching the lca iii which could be used to define the bottom interface pink solid line in fig 8 of the saline region similar as the way of selecting the top interface of the saline region within the phreatic aquifer group in each borehole we first selected the w bi point where the rate of change in the electric logging resistivity curve was most notable from a low to high value at this moment fig 8a2 b2 and c2 subsequently the qualified v bi points were filtered to generate the spatial distribution of the bottom interface of the saline region following the same inflection point rule fig 10a1 b1 and c1 3 2 3 mathmatic tds models based on average v ctr the total ionic concentration of dissolved minerals in the water as characterized by the tds mainly affects the pore water resistivity archie 1942 in the freshwater region tds 3 g l the influence of the tds is notably often waned in contrast the v ctr can better reflect lithological variation instead of the tds however the tds has a significant correlation with the aquifer resistivity through a power function relationship in brackish and saline water tds 3 g l accurate prediction of the tds value between boreholes is significantly important for the evaluation of water quality i e salt content as it is linked to the resistivity in the study area we first examined the relationship between the average tds and v ctr which were obtained by averaging the v ctr within the depth range defined by the interpreted top bottom interface of each zonation at each ves point fig 11 a and b indicates the average v ctr of lca i and ii respectively the points where the tds was measured from lca i 58 points and ii 33 points are marked in fig 11a and b respectively only referring to the tds values recorded at each point we found that the overall trend in the tds values in the study region was lower in the west and higher in the east which is basically consistent with the trend in the numerical fluctuation of the average v ctr in the same region the relationship between them is notably not as linear as it appears therefore referring to the power function equation in chang et al 1983 we developed a new power function to construct a relationship between the tds y and average v ctr x of the aquifer as follows 9 y a x c b where a b and c are undetermined parameters owing to deposition during different geological periods rock matrices and other information show different characteristics in different strata in addition considering the defects in the vertical resolution for the v ctr itself fig 8 we do not recommend the use of a set of standards to corelate the tds with the v ctr because of multiple lcas with different feature therefore two mathematical models for lca i and ii fig 12 a and b respectively were established based on the 91 tds and average v ctr at the corresponding borehole locations subsequently the tds values between the sampled boreholes were spatially calculated by the modes for the two corresponding aquifers in the study region 4 interpretation and dicussion 4 1 desalination zone the degree of transgression and subsequent desalination controls the spatial distribution of the salt content in the aquifer where holocene transgression affected the entire region the aquifer near the surface was initially occupied by saline water however during the later period influenced by surface water and precipitation desalination the aquifer formed a shallow desalination zone based on the analysis of the boreholes the v ctr had a preliminary high value freshwater and gradually decreased with depth when approaching transgression layers dominated by saline water discussed in more detail in section 4 2 in contrast the resistivity values of lca i and ii were relatively low and did not fluctuate significantly compared with lca iii as the influence of transgression forms a large scale saline layer fig 13 presents a plane contour map of the thickness of the desalination zone indicating the top boundary of the saline region the desalination zone was characterized by sub thick thick thin zoning from the southwest to the northeast where the sub thick and thick region far from the coast and thin area nearby the coast fig 2 note that the main thick region is corresponding to the micro upland with the strongest desalination effect by surface water infiltration in contract the low flat coastal zone is only weakened whereas the desalination effect is weak the distribution of the local desalination zone corresponds to the geomorphic characteristics and topography for example the alluvial plain in the yangtze river delta is thick while the desalination zones along the eastern coastline and northern littoral sea amass plain are thin or non existent sediment particles in sand ridges and micro uplands chartreuse color in fig 2 have better coarse permeability higher terrain better groundwater runoff discharge conditions stronger water circulation and a thicker desalination zone however the desalination zone in the low lying area with fine sediment particles has a small thickness or even no desalination zone 4 2 saline water zone the thickness of the saline water zone is mainly controlled by its bottom boundary in fig 10 the saline layer along l17 was distributed in the lower part of the phreatic aquifer and upper part of lca i one can see that the thickness of the saline water zone gradually disappears from north to south e g sounding no 0 4 shown in fig 10b along with l40 we can observe that the thickness of the saline layer significantly compared as the one along l17 increased in the center of the study area which began to permeate slowly from lca i into lca ii the saline water layer along l48 indicates an increasing thickness in the east the thickness of the saline water layer becomes increasingly thicker indicating that the saline water begins to gradually permeate from lca ii into lca iii the spatial variation in the bottom interface of the saline water region is mainly distributed in lca i and ii as shown in fig 14 the thickness of the saline water zone increases along the direction of the three perpendicular profiles from the west to the east resulting from multi stage transgressions from northeast to southwest since the early pleistocene in the early pleistocene sea water only moved westward along the valley and was controlled by the coastal topography such that the estuary area was wide and slow forming a fan shaped saline area in the southern part of the survey area and the lateral shallow rapid region in the narrower river area this led to the formation of the west north belt note the northern beaded saline zone was caused by transgression from the north beyond the study area all the area mentioned above are trapped by yellow dash line in fig 14 where the presence of brackish water in the lca iii from a few sporadic boreholes confirms the observed phenomenon of local salinization furthermore the presence of a local transgressive layer was confirmed by the discovery of euryhaline foraminifera at a depth of 250 260 m in sanyu lvshi town and nanyang and the regional v ctr completely reveals this transgressive inversion channel as well subsequently the upper layer was covered with a clay layer tens of meters thick where late transgressive salt water was unable to infiltrate and replenish the pleistocene aquifer underneath resulting in the early pleistocene lcas and other areas of freshwater some sporadic anomalous points with local thick increasement are mainly caused by the overexploitation resulting in the leakage of connate water to make freshwater salination with the increase in the scale of transgression in the middle pleistocene as the undulating coastal topography still controlled the saline water zone the seawater moved westward along the valley flooded in and reached the tongzhou haimen line forming the distribution characteristics of lca ii with saline water to the east and freshwater to the west of the line in the early and late periods of the late pleistocene the eastern coastal areas of china suffered from the strongest transgressions which almost covered the entire study area such that lca i was dominated by saline water except for a small area around zhagang and xinkaizhen with freshwater in the late pleistocene the holocene transgression was the extensive transgression since the quaternary covering the entire study area however the desalination effect in the later period desalinated the surface layer the desalination effect was especially the strongest around zhagang and xinkaizhen forming two locally freshwater areas 4 3 tds analysis of water quality fig 15 presents the spatial distribution of the tds in the study area compared with the estimated tds values interpolated only using the borehole data fig 15a1 and b1 the new method can characterize the distribution of the tds in a more detailed manner according to the tds distribution fig 15a2 lca i was classified into two subregions i e southwest with low tds and northeast with high tds along a northwest line from tongzhou to nanyangzhen in the southwest subregion a v shaped fresh tds 3 g l distribution occurs around nantong city however in the northeast subregion the eastern region was mainly characterized by saline water with tds values generally greater than 10 g l the tds almost reached 30 g l adjacent to the coast of the yellow sea similarly in fig 15b2 lca ii was divided into three subregions based on the tds distribution i e the western tds 3 g l fresh water central tds 3 10 g l brackish water and eastern adjacent to the yellow sea tds 10 g l saline water regions the formation of the groundwater hydrochemistry in coastal areas is a complex physical and chemical process which is jointly restricted by numerous factors such as the paleogeographic conditions of transgression facies hydrogeological structure and groundwater circulation conditions among which the most important factors affecting the tds are transgressions and regressions owing to the stage and fluctuation of transgressions and regressions a series of geological phenomena of alternating land and sea depositions have formed in the study area thus leading to the formation of large areas of saline water in lca i and ii and an uneven distribution of salinity on the plane the tds of lca ii showed a notable anomaly in the form of a stepped superposition with relatively low values over a small local range reflecting the low transgression intensity and periodic fluctuation in the middle pleistocene fig 15b2 the most intense transgression occurred in the eastern subregion where mixed salinization of the original terrestrial freshwater dissolved and filtered water due to invasive seawater was relatively sufficient the salinization had a negligible impact on the central area especially in the western area where the degree of transgression was relatively low with a boundary line that was generally in the southwest direction reflecting the periodic fluctuation in the transgressions during the middle pleistocene the relatively low tds anomaly in a small area reflects the closure of the overlying clay layer such that the area was less exposed to seawater a tds strip green shown in fig 15a2 with a slightly higher value compared with the v shaped high tds distribution in the western subregion of lca i reflects the high marine transgression intensity in the late pleistocene that covered the entire study area where the sufficiently mixed salination effect dissolved and filtered water presented a relatively uniform distribution of high background tds the fresh brackish water in lca i along the yangtze river and relatively low tds anomaly in the banded belt in the southern part of the study area may be related to the recharge desalination from the ancient yangtze river 5 conclusions existing techniques and workflow for the appraisal of the groundwater distribution and quality mainly use the ground based geoelectric resistivity method in coastal plain areas however effectively integrating hydrological data geological data and geophysical data to improve the accuracy of groundwater system delineations and groundwater quality appraisals remains a significant challenge in the hydrogeological community a novel workflow which combines extensive ves data and borehole data was implemented to reveal the saline water and freshwater distributions associated with hydrological information the workflow comprised a conducting areal v ctr calibrated by a modified reflection coefficient and novel depth correction factor b determining the boundaries of aquifer structures and saline water zones using the newly developed w bi point and v bi points approaches respectively and c constructing tds resistivity average v ctr correlation power function models to estimate the tds values for lca i and ii dominated by saline water in the study area the interpreted results are of great significance for understanding the groundwater distribution associated with the quaternary geology and hydrogeology and can be potentially used to analyze and guide the development and utilization of water resources in the study area this study led to the following key conclusions 1 the modified reflection coefficient improved the discrepancy in the descending branch of the electric sounding curve with respect to the electric logging resistivity near the surface in the coastal area consistency in this trend is crucial for the subsequent determination of the saline water zone top interface in areas that cannot be constrained by the borehole 2 with the novel depth correction factor derived by the ratio of the two depth inflection points both carefully selected from the v mtr the overall trend in the variation of the v ctr with depth was essentially consistent with the electric logging resistivity curves at greater depths the consistency in the inflection point from low to high of the v ctr curve as a function of the electric logging resistivity was improved and ensured which played an important role in the subsequent delineation of the lower interface of the saline water region 3 considering that the saline region is located in the middle of the two sets of freshwater regions the resistivity variation with depth occurred as a low high low pattern therefore the w bi point and v bi points approaches were used to identify the spatial top and bottom interface of the saline water zone by selecting the most notable rate of change points along the v ctr curves in the study area 4 to characterize the nonlinear relationship between the borehole based tds and v ctr at the same location two modified power functions which fit well with the sample points were developed to predict the tds distribution within the corresponding lca under different hydrological situations more detailed information can be obtained from the planar distribution of the tds transformed from the v ctr by the power functions 5 according to the comprehensive interpretation of the v ctr and associated borehole data the top and bottom interfaces of the saline water zone were quantitatively determined and the aquifer tds based on the hydrogeological system was also quantitatively estimated the integration of the ves data and borehole information into the logging correction process can provide overall characteristics that are consistent with the interface as determined only by the borehole in addition results with a high spatial resolution that matched the density of the v ctr measuring points were provided allowing the reasonable interpretation of some local anomalies 6 the thickness of the surface desalination zone characterized in detail the shallow freshwater resources in coastal areas the depth of the bottom boundary of the saline water layer described the regional dividing line of the range of transgression intensity early pleistocene stripped seawater irrigation channels and the local salinization zone caused by leakage due to overmining operations the tds spatial distribution mainly reflects the current concentration distribution of saline water and reveals the intensity of transgression and the desalination range of yangtze river recharge the detailed information of tds distribution is of great significance to the analysis of water quality trend in coastal areas and the rational development and utilization of groundwater in the future credit authorship contribution statement tongxiao shang software methodology writing original draft zhengwei xu writing

4469,in most coastal alluvial plains the groundwater area of the aquifer is a rich environment that has experienced an extended period of marine deposition and is highly vulnerable to increasing urbanization excessive exploitation of groundwater has resulted in recent seawater intrusion and connate water leakage leading to freshwater salinization in this study a novel workflow is designed for groundwater appraisal first revised one dimensional direct transformation schemes were developed and applied to extensive vertical electrical sounding ves points sampled by a schlumberger array to obtain the ves based calibrated transformed resistivity v ctr as calibrated by the modified reflection coefficient and novel depth correction factor next the interfaces of all leaky confined aquifers lcas and the saline water zone were quantitatively determined via hybrid interpretation methods finally to better understand the salt level i e fresh brackish or saline and perform assessments of the groundwater quality total dissolved solids tds planar distributions were interpolated using two different power functions linking the v ctr and measured tds from the sampled boreholes for the corresponding aquifer unit the workflow was examined based on hydrological and geophysical data acquired at the yangtze river delta nantong region jiangsu province china the interpreted results are of great significance for understanding the groundwater distribution associated with the quaternary geology and hydrogeology and can be potentially used to analyze and guide the development and utilization of water resources in the study area keywords groundwater quality division vertical electrical sounding ves total dissolved solids tds fresh saline water interface coastal area china 1 introduction freshwater is one of the most important natural resources for meeting the basic living needs of humans in recent decades especially in heavily populated coastal areas rapid population growth has aggravated the shortage of water resources and enhanced the importance of existing water resources and their quality coastal plains are located in the land and ocean interaction zone mostly defined as alluvial plains formed by the interactions between rivers and oceans where loose sedimentary layers are widely distributed the underground contains abundant pore water in loose rock in which a certain amount of connate water may be stored owing to the rise and fall of sea level in the quaternary period forming the hydro chemical condition of the coexistence of fresh saline water excessive and blind exploitation of groundwater results in the formation of a regional depression cone which has led to recent seawater intrusion and connate water leakage resulting in hybrid salinization sun et al 2019 that has produced freshwater salinization recent seawater intrusion for example usually occurs near the coastline where the pressure of freshwater decrease to below that of sea water when the groundwater level drops and sea water begins to intrude inland leading to the salinization of shallow aquifers gimenez forcada 2014 amiri et al 2016 in contrast connate water leakage generally occurs in inland areas where the depression cone allows connate water located on top of freshwater to recharge the deep freshwater layer throughout the aquitard i e especially for a thin aquitard under hydrodynamic drive leading to increased salinity in the deep aquifer han et al 2012 in rare cases groundwater salinization can be caused by water rock interaction dissolution from evaporated salt deposits in some coastal plains gosselin et al 2004 moussa et al 2011 meng et al 2019 groundwater salinization is a common problem in coastal areas as well as a focus in the hydrogeological community for decades therefore adequately understanding the current spatial distribution of groundwater e g including the fresh saline water interfaces and its quality e g salinity within aquifers and the formation mechanism is essential for the effective prevention for the salinization of freshwater and rational improvements to the use of groundwater with varying quality traditional surveys that interpret the distribution and quality of groundwater are usually carried out by analyzing boreholes at limited points to obtain hydro chemical implications wu et al 2008 rasmussen et al 2013 joung and shiller 2014 however most of the applications mentioned above exhibit the main disadvantage of sparse point locations resulting in the inaccurate estimation of hydrological information between any two wells to overcome this problem previous studies have preferred to use remote geophysical technology which is advantageous owing to its optimal costs in situ detection non destructive quality and sufficient density of data points several studies have successfully identified coastal aquifer structures and dynamics by combining the seismic refraction method and borehole data analysis crimes et al 1994 burschil et al 2012 kwong et al 2016 abelson et al 2018 however owing to weak velocity and density contrasts seismic technology is rarely used to identify the interface of saline water zone and assess groundwater quality for which the ability to split groundwater by salinity is a prerequisite based on another physical property of rocks fresh and saline aquifers have a capacity to carry a current or what is commonly referred to as resistance which can be used to distinguish the groundwater distribution quality and the lithology in early exploration stages the estimation of the aquifer distribution based on an airborne electromagnetic survey configuration has been an active research area for large exploration coast area across a specific time el kaliouby and abdalla 2015 el kaliouby 2020 or frequency domain supper et al 2009 suzuki et al 2017 as another effective ground based geoelectric resistivity approach the vertical electrical sounding ves survey is especially suitable for the delineation of the groundwater distribution and interface between fresh and saline zone in coastal plains shaaban 2001 corriols et al 2009 bouderbala et al 2016 hasan et al 2019 the characterization of an aquifer and or groundwater appraisal using ves data collected by a schlumberger array are usually presented in the form of a corresponding resistivity model especially for alluvial fields ibe and uzoukwu 2001 perttu et al 2011 maiti et al 2013 kasprzak et al 2017 limited ves data has been widely employed in numerous studies on coastal areas to delineate the top and bottom boundaries of the low resistivity layer which is recovered by iterative inversion based on a one dimensional layered model as the fresh saline water interface ginzburg and levanon 1976 batayneh 2006 srinivas et al 2012 however h shaped curves which are common in coastal areas will result in an s equivalence phenomena and affect the results of iterative inversion leading to thickness instability of the low resistivity layer alvarez et al 2008 in contrast when the number of ves points is relatively small fine inversion is applicable however iterative inversion will become time consuming and unstable with a significant increase in the number of ves points ruan 1996 converted ves data using logarithm and derivative transformations to ensure the stability and unity of the solution nevertheless this method results in a discrepancy with respect to the descending branch of the ves curve total dissolved solids tds is an effective parameter to characterize groundwater quality which can be used to represent the total organic matter content dominated by salinity taking advantage of the resistivity to characterize the tds for surface water appraisal is highly convenient chang et al 1983 attempted to establish a relationship between well based tds and pore water resistivity to evaluate groundwater quality however directly measuring the pore water resistivity in the field is difficult alternatively the plane distribution of water quality is usually based on the interpolated original apparent resistivity and measured tds asfahani and abou zakhem 2013 demonstrated a good agreement between low resistivity areas in the original apparent resistivity plan distribution and tds planar interpolation results the dar zarrouk parameter introduced for describing the relationship between transversal unit resistance and longitudinal unit conductance was successfully used to determine the extent of saline water intrusion in coastal areas associated with tds data khalil 2006 george et al 2015 hasan et al 2019 however these studies only provide the overall characteristics of fresh saline water with neither using electric logging data for correction nor do they correspond to the aquifer system as determined by the hydrogeological borehole in other words to date negligible research has focused on linking hydrogeological information with the tds for comprehensive interpretations and applications therefore this is not an appropriate technique to describe the groundwater quality distribution within different aquifer systems resulting from transgression during different periods in this study we introduce a novel hybrid data processing hydrology and geophysics and interpretation workflow where the fresh saline water zone is quantitatively identified and the tds spatial distribution is determined under the condition of the hydrological system first extensive ves data were implemented by transforming the measured apparent resistivity to a calibrated transformed resistivity v ctr using a modified reflection coefficient and novel depth correction factor associated with electrical logging resistivity second the spatial boundaries of all lcas were determined in terms of the interpolation of the borehole based hydrogeological zonation meanwhile the spatial interfaces top and bottom of the saline water zone were confirmed with reference to the novel ves based calibrated transformed resistivity inflection v bi points approach using the ves data and well based inflection w bi point method using the electrical logging resistivity data both inflection methods can be used under the condition of a large existing resistivity contrast finally from a groundwater quality appraisal perspective we also developed a mathematical model to construct a power function relationship between v ctr and tds to estimate and achieve the tds spatial distribution within corresponding different aquifers between boreholes the new methods and workflow were illustrated by a case study in the nantong region jiangsu province china we speculate that the novel approaches and workflow product can provide comprehensive and quantitative interpretations for the analysis of coastal plain groundwater systematics and are more suitable for use in areas with similar geological conditions worldwide 2 hydrogeological environment 2 1 geographic setting the nantong survey area is located in the east central part of jiangsu province in the northern wing of the yangtze river delta which faces the yellow sea to the east and the yangtze river to the south near the river mouth ranging from 31 50 32 10 n and 120 45 122 00 e with an area of 3 550 km2 fig 1 the survey area near low level coastal areas elevation of 3 5 m is slightly higher in the northwest and then gradually inclines from the west to the east the surface drainage system is well developed with crisscrossing rivers while the groundwater table ranges from 1 2 to 1 6 m there are four types of landforms in the region denuded inselberg the yangtze river delta plain littoral sea amasses plain and man made landform the denuded inselberg are only distributed in the southern region of the survey area consisting of silurian and devonian quartz sandstones red color in fig 2 the yangtze river delta plain formed from sedimentary accumulation throughout the past 1 000 2 000 years colors in the middle column of the legend in fig 2 the sand ridges light yellow in fig 2 are linearly distributed from the east to the west the ground elevation ranges from 3 5

the surface sediments are mainly clayey silt silty clay muddy silt and muddy clay most of the man made landforms gray in fig 2 are near the coastal area bordered by the eastern sea wall they are used for industrial aquaculture 2 2 hydrology 2 2 1 hydrological system fig 3 shows an example of a typical borehole w23 in the study area displaying the water bearing rocks and their corresponding stratigraphic age as well as the sedimentary facies lithology tds and electrical characteristics the pore aquifers in loose rocks are closely related to the change in the river sea and paleogeographic environment characterized by significant layering the aquifers can be divided into phreatic aquifer and four lcas i e water bearing rock according to their stratigraphic ages lca iv group is neogene n multi story channel deposits with a locally distributed alluvial conglomeratic clay layer the aquifer layer is dominated by medium coarse sand and medium fine sands the aquitard is characterized by floodplain clayey soil with a generally high clay content lca iii group is lower pleistocene qp1 multi period estuary with superimposed streams the aquifer layer is dominated by coarse middle coarse grain pebbly sands and the aquitard is widely distributed floodplain clayey soil lca ii group is middle pleistocene qp2 multi stage estuary with superimposed streams the aquifer layer consists of fining upward sands from coarse to fine grain the aquitard is dominated by floodplain clayey soil lca i group consists of upper pleistocene qp3 channel estuarine shallow marine deposits the aquifer layer has different sands from various facies including thick fluvial channel sands ranging from coarse to fine grained estuarine deltaic and shoreface fine grain sands interbedded by a thin clay layer the aquitard is defined as the clay layer mainly deposited in holocene qh shallow marine lagoon tidal flat and deltaic facies the phreatic aquifer group is dominated by holocene qh deltaic sands 2 2 2 aquifer water quality and electrical properties since the quaternary the study area has experienced seven major transgressions brine was formed by the mixing of seawater and pore water in sands freshwater can only be preserved in aquifer sands where seawater is not in direct contact the groundwater quality is mainly affected by the range and intensity of multiple transgressions but it is also affected by late precipitation surface water infiltration desalination and human activities which renders the groundwater quality characteristics as increasingly complex lca iii as the main production strata is dominated by drinkable freshwater tds 1 g l with a high resistivity due to the thick and coarse grained sands lca iv mainly consists of freshwater 1 g l tds 3 g l where the electrical logs show a lower resistivity than the lca iii aquifer due to both high clay content and tds lca i and ii mainly consist of brackish and saline water with tds values of more than 3 g l up to 20 g l where the resistivity is low the phreatic aquifer is a transgressive section which is dominantly saline water however owing to the infiltration and recharge of freshwater i e surface water the groundwater quality has been noticeably desalinated forming a shallow desalination zone of approximately 10 m the electric logging shows that the shallow resistance increases rapidly after the low resistivity which represents the saline water region 3 datasets and workflow 3 1 datasets and configuration fig 4 shows that there are a total of 107 geologically stratified hydrogeological zonation

presented in the next three sections i e section3 2 1 section 3 2 2 and section 3 2 3 to better stand out the main contributions mentioned in the introdcution section we marked them all with solid yellow circles and would like to convey to readers the idea of integration of multiple datasets during the workflow 3 2 1 calibrated transformation resistivity v ctr the resistivity and thickness of each layer can be directly calculated using the following pseudocode combining the transformation formula originally derived by ruan 1996 for the first layer i 1 as follows 1 ρ i ρ 1 ρ s 1 a n d 2 h i h 1 r 1 for the 2nd 3rd nth layer i 2 3 n we obtained the following 3 ρ i ρ s i ρ s i 1 1 k i 1 k i a n d 4 h i r i r i 1 1 k 2 i where ρ i is the transformed resistivity of the i th layer ρ s i is the measured apparent resistivity of the i th electrode spacing h i is the calculated thickness of the i th layer and r i is the i th a b 2 electrode spacing the parameter k i is defined as the reflection coefficient of the i th layer representing the slope of the electrical sounding curve from the i 1 th to the i th electrode spacing in the double logarithmic coordinates as follows 5 k i log ρ s i log ρ s i 1 log r i log r i 1 however the curve derived from eqs 3 and 4 did not fit well with the descending branch of electric logging resistivity to improve the fit we merged the reflection coefficient k i proposed by shaoqiu 1993 into eqs 3 and 4 where k i was be replaced by k i therefore we rewrote eqs 3 and 4 as follows 6 ρ i ρ s i ρ s i 1 1 k i 1 k i a n d 7 h i r i r i 1 1 k 2 i where k i was expressed as follows 8 k i k i 1 k i 1 05 1 k i k 2 i k i 0 k i k i 0 where ρ i is referred to as the modified transformed resistivity of the i th layer and h i is the calculated thickness of the i th layer as calibrated by k i the modified transformed resistivity v mtr ρ i is denoted by the red dashed line in fig 7 a which overlaps with the electric logging resistivity solid black line measured apparent resistivity solid light blue line and transformed resistivity ρ i dark blue dashed line first the curves of the measured apparent resistivity and electric logging resistivity which vary with depth have notable differences in their trends compared with the transformed resistivity the curve of the v mtr is more consistent with the electric logging resistivity curve at the near surface fig 7b however the v mtr curve is characterized by an improper fit apparent discrepancies as the transformed resistivity at deeper depths fig 7a to solve this problem referring to the hydrogeological zonation we introduced a novel depth correction factor α which was estimated based on the ratio of the two depth inflection points from each available borehole one point was selected from the v mtr curve and another was selected from the electrical logging resistivity curve the main criterion used to select the two inflection points on the two corresponding resistivity curves was based on where the rate of change was most notable where resistivity starts to raise from small to large which represents the interface of fresh and saline water discussed in more detail in section 3 2 2 we named the v mtr as calibrated by α as v ctr fig 7 shows the variation trend along the v ctr curve solid red line with depth which captured the main characteristics of the electrical logging resistivity curve both near the surface mainly fig 7b and at the depths around lca iii basically where the v ctr amplitude is almost 50 lower than the electric logging resistivity fig 7a fig 8 compares the v ctr solid red line and electric logging resistivity curves solid black within 12 boreholes arranged in a west east direction forming three invisible configuration lines from north to south as shown fig 4 subsequently the remaining v mtr data were calibrated with the corresponding α which is shown on contour map fig 9 as well as to generate the spatial distribution of the v ctr 3 2 2 identification of boundaries aquifers and saline water zone to establish the spatial interfaces in hydrogeological zonations and fresh saline water we further comprehensively inferred their tops and bottoms using the v ctr electrical logging resistivity and the hydrogeological zonations acquired from all available boreholes table 1 lists the different types of definitions and interpretations for the top and bottom interfaces of each aquifer and the saline water zone for phreatic aquifer four lcas and bedrock groups from both the top and bottom interfaces except for bedrock top were determined by directly employing hydrogeological zonation information at the corresponding zonation in the boreholes from the study area the top interface of the phreatic group as an exceptional case was marked by default by the ground surface the spatial top and bottom interfaces were then interpolated by the kriging method which yields the best linear unbiased prediction of the intermediate depth values by computing a weighted average of the known corresponding values in the neighborhood of the borehole points williams 1998 koziel and bandler 2012 we note that carrying out the kriging interpolation method to delineate the interfaces of the phreatic layer and lcas especially to characterize the aquitard fig 3 from them is more acceptable than employing the resistivity contrast owing to the weak resistivity contrast however due to depth limitations of the acquirement the depth of the effective hydrogeological zonation data was approximately up to 300 m at their deepest point where the depth of the bed rock top interface usually cannot be covered in most boreholes therefore taking advantage of the v ctr contrast is an effective method to demarcate the top interfaces of bed rock by resistivity contrast at deeper depths fig 10 furthermore three v ctr vertical sections were established along each survey line i e l17 fig 10a1 l40 fig 10b1 and l48 fig 10c1 in the western central and eastern regions of the study area respectively the boundaries of the hydrogeological zonation and interfaces of the saline water region are shown in fig 10a2 10b2 and 10c2 we integrated the resistivity v ctr and electric logging resistivity with the hydrogeological systems delineating the saline water zone interfaces and their relationship with the aquifers on this basis in practice a sharp boundary between saline and freshwater does not exist however the state of the gradual transition zone can be basically presented but the gradient of the transition zone varies for different aquifers based on fig 8 there are substantial changes in both the low resistivity i e v ctr and electric logging resistivity in the middle and high resistivity in the upper and lower parts therefore the transition zone between saline and freshwater was simplified as a line in the study area for saline water region demarcation the upper sub zone with a high resistivity 5 30 ω m indicates a shallow desalination zone dominated by freshwater while the lower sub zone is basically filled with saline water with a low resistivity 6 ω m therefore the interpolated phreatic aquifer group at the borehole location was divided into two sub zones based on the top boundary pink solid line in fig 8 of the saline region which was identified with the w bi points fig 8a1 b1 and c1 next the spatial top boundary distribution of the saline region between the boreholes was obtained using v bi points interpolation fig 10a1 10b1 and 10c1 both the w bi and v bi points were selected based on the rate of the change in the electric logging resistivity and v crt curve respectively which was most notable during the dropping process from near the surface we also note that a sudden increase both in the v ctr and electrical logging resistivity values can be observed in range of depth mostly approaching the lca iii which could be used to define the bottom interface pink solid line in fig 8 of the saline region similar as the way of selecting the top interface of the saline region within the phreatic aquifer group in each borehole we first selected the w bi point where the rate of change in the electric logging resistivity curve was most notable from a low to high value at this moment fig 8a2 b2 and c2 subsequently the qualified v bi points were filtered to generate the spatial distribution of the bottom interface of the saline region following the same inflection point rule fig 10a1 b1 and c1 3 2 3 mathmatic tds models based on average v ctr the total ionic concentration of dissolved minerals in the water as characterized by the tds mainly affects the pore water resistivity archie 1942 in the freshwater region tds 3 g l the influence of the tds is notably often waned in contrast the v ctr can better reflect lithological variation instead of the tds however the tds has a significant correlation with the aquifer resistivity through a power function relationship in brackish and saline water tds 3 g l accurate prediction of the tds value between boreholes is significantly important for the evaluation of water quality i e salt content as it is linked to the resistivity in the study area we first examined the relationship between the average tds and v ctr which were obtained by averaging the v ctr within the depth range defined by the interpreted top bottom interface of each zonation at each ves point fig 11 a and b indicates the average v ctr of lca i and ii respectively the points where the tds was measured from lca i 58 points and ii 33 points are marked in fig 11a and b respectively only referring to the tds values recorded at each point we found that the overall trend in the tds values in the study region was lower in the west and higher in the east which is basically consistent with the trend in the numerical fluctuation of the average v ctr in the same region the relationship between them is notably not as linear as it appears therefore referring to the power function equation in chang et al 1983 we developed a new power function to construct a relationship between the tds y and average v ctr x of the aquifer as follows 9 y a x c b where a b and c are undetermined parameters owing to deposition during different geological periods rock matrices and other information show different characteristics in different strata in addition considering the defects in the vertical resolution for the v ctr itself fig 8 we do not recommend the use of a set of standards to corelate the tds with the v ctr because of multiple lcas with different feature therefore two mathematical models for lca i and ii fig 12 a and b respectively were established based on the 91 tds and average v ctr at the corresponding borehole locations subsequently the tds values between the sampled boreholes were spatially calculated by the modes for the two corresponding aquifers in the study region 4 interpretation and dicussion 4 1 desalination zone the degree of transgression and subsequent desalination controls the spatial distribution of the salt content in the aquifer where holocene transgression affected the entire region the aquifer near the surface was initially occupied by saline water however during the later period influenced by surface water and precipitation desalination the aquifer formed a shallow desalination zone based on the analysis of the boreholes the v ctr had a preliminary high value freshwater and gradually decreased with depth when approaching transgression layers dominated by saline water discussed in more detail in section 4 2 in contrast the resistivity values of lca i and ii were relatively low and did not fluctuate significantly compared with lca iii as the influence of transgression forms a large scale saline layer fig 13 presents a plane contour map of the thickness of the desalination zone indicating the top boundary of the saline region the desalination zone was characterized by sub thick thick thin zoning from the southwest to the northeast where the sub thick and thick region far from the coast and thin area nearby the coast fig 2 note that the main thick region is corresponding to the micro upland with the strongest desalination effect by surface water infiltration in contract the low flat coastal zone is only weakened whereas the desalination effect is weak the distribution of the local desalination zone corresponds to the geomorphic characteristics and topography for example the alluvial plain in the yangtze river delta is thick while the desalination zones along the eastern coastline and northern littoral sea amass plain are thin or non existent sediment particles in sand ridges and micro uplands chartreuse color in fig 2 have better coarse permeability higher terrain better groundwater runoff discharge conditions stronger water circulation and a thicker desalination zone however the desalination zone in the low lying area with fine sediment particles has a small thickness or even no desalination zone 4 2 saline water zone the thickness of the saline water zone is mainly controlled by its bottom boundary in fig 10 the saline layer along l17 was distributed in the lower part of the phreatic aquifer and upper part of lca i one can see that the thickness of the saline water zone gradually disappears from north to south e g sounding no 0 4 shown in fig 10b along with l40 we can observe that the thickness of the saline layer significantly compared as the one along l17 increased in the center of the study area which began to permeate slowly from lca i into lca ii the saline water layer along l48 indicates an increasing thickness in the east the thickness of the saline water layer becomes increasingly thicker indicating that the saline water begins to gradually permeate from lca ii into lca iii the spatial variation in the bottom interface of the saline water region is mainly distributed in lca i and ii as shown in fig 14 the thickness of the saline water zone increases along the direction of the three perpendicular profiles from the west to the east resulting from multi stage transgressions from northeast to southwest since the early pleistocene in the early pleistocene sea water only moved westward along the valley and was controlled by the coastal topography such that the estuary area was wide and slow forming a fan shaped saline area in the southern part of the survey area and the lateral shallow rapid region in the narrower river area this led to the formation of the west north belt note the northern beaded saline zone was caused by transgression from the north beyond the study area all the area mentioned above are trapped by yellow dash line in fig 14 where the presence of brackish water in the lca iii from a few sporadic boreholes confirms the observed phenomenon of local salinization furthermore the presence of a local transgressive layer was confirmed by the discovery of euryhaline foraminifera at a depth of 250 260 m in sanyu lvshi town and nanyang and the regional v ctr completely reveals this transgressive inversion channel as well subsequently the upper layer was covered with a clay layer tens of meters thick where late transgressive salt water was unable to infiltrate and replenish the pleistocene aquifer underneath resulting in the early pleistocene lcas and other areas of freshwater some sporadic anomalous points with local thick increasement are mainly caused by the overexploitation resulting in the leakage of connate water to make freshwater salination with the increase in the scale of transgression in the middle pleistocene as the undulating coastal topography still controlled the saline water zone the seawater moved westward along the valley flooded in and reached the tongzhou haimen line forming the distribution characteristics of lca ii with saline water to the east and freshwater to the west of the line in the early and late periods of the late pleistocene the eastern coastal areas of china suffered from the strongest transgressions which almost covered the entire study area such that lca i was dominated by saline water except for a small area around zhagang and xinkaizhen with freshwater in the late pleistocene the holocene transgression was the extensive transgression since the quaternary covering the entire study area however the desalination effect in the later period desalinated the surface layer the desalination effect was especially the strongest around zhagang and xinkaizhen forming two locally freshwater areas 4 3 tds analysis of water quality fig 15 presents the spatial distribution of the tds in the study area compared with the estimated tds values interpolated only using the borehole data fig 15a1 and b1 the new method can characterize the distribution of the tds in a more detailed manner according to the tds distribution fig 15a2 lca i was classified into two subregions i e southwest with low tds and northeast with high tds along a northwest line from tongzhou to nanyangzhen in the southwest subregion a v shaped fresh tds 3 g l distribution occurs around nantong city however in the northeast subregion the eastern region was mainly characterized by saline water with tds values generally greater than 10 g l the tds almost reached 30 g l adjacent to the coast of the yellow sea similarly in fig 15b2 lca ii was divided into three subregions based on the tds distribution i e the western tds 3 g l fresh water central tds 3 10 g l brackish water and eastern adjacent to the yellow sea tds 10 g l saline water regions the formation of the groundwater hydrochemistry in coastal areas is a complex physical and chemical process which is jointly restricted by numerous factors such as the paleogeographic conditions of transgression facies hydrogeological structure and groundwater circulation conditions among which the most important factors affecting the tds are transgressions and regressions owing to the stage and fluctuation of transgressions and regressions a series of geological phenomena of alternating land and sea depositions have formed in the study area thus leading to the formation of large areas of saline water in lca i and ii and an uneven distribution of salinity on the plane the tds of lca ii showed a notable anomaly in the form of a stepped superposition with relatively low values over a small local range reflecting the low transgression intensity and periodic fluctuation in the middle pleistocene fig 15b2 the most intense transgression occurred in the eastern subregion where mixed salinization of the original terrestrial freshwater dissolved and filtered water due to invasive seawater was relatively sufficient the salinization had a negligible impact on the central area especially in the western area where the degree of transgression was relatively low with a boundary line that was generally in the southwest direction reflecting the periodic fluctuation in the transgressions during the middle pleistocene the relatively low tds anomaly in a small area reflects the closure of the overlying clay layer such that the area was less exposed to seawater a tds strip green shown in fig 15a2 with a slightly higher value compared with the v shaped high tds distribution in the western subregion of lca i reflects the high marine transgression intensity in the late pleistocene that covered the entire study area where the sufficiently mixed salination effect dissolved and filtered water presented a relatively uniform distribution of high background tds the fresh brackish water in lca i along the yangtze river and relatively low tds anomaly in the banded belt in the southern part of the study area may be related to the recharge desalination from the ancient yangtze river 5 conclusions existing techniques and workflow for the appraisal of the groundwater distribution and quality mainly use the ground based geoelectric resistivity method in coastal plain areas however effectively integrating hydrological data geological data and geophysical data to improve the accuracy of groundwater system delineations and groundwater quality appraisals remains a significant challenge in the hydrogeological community a novel workflow which combines extensive ves data and borehole data was implemented to reveal the saline water and freshwater distributions associated with hydrological information the workflow comprised a conducting areal v ctr calibrated by a modified reflection coefficient and novel depth correction factor b determining the boundaries of aquifer structures and saline water zones using the newly developed w bi point and v bi points approaches respectively and c constructing tds resistivity average v ctr correlation power function models to estimate the tds values for lca i and ii dominated by saline water in the study area the interpreted results are of great significance for understanding the groundwater distribution associated with the quaternary geology and hydrogeology and can be potentially used to analyze and guide the development and utilization of water resources in the study area this study led to the following key conclusions 1 the modified reflection coefficient improved the discrepancy in the descending branch of the electric sounding curve with respect to the electric logging resistivity near the surface in the coastal area consistency in this trend is crucial for the subsequent determination of the saline water zone top interface in areas that cannot be constrained by the borehole 2 with the novel depth correction factor derived by the ratio of the two depth inflection points both carefully selected from the v mtr the overall trend in the variation of the v ctr with depth was essentially consistent with the electric logging resistivity curves at greater depths the consistency in the inflection point from low to high of the v ctr curve as a function of the electric logging resistivity was improved and ensured which played an important role in the subsequent delineation of the lower interface of the saline water region 3 considering that the saline region is located in the middle of the two sets of freshwater regions the resistivity variation with depth occurred as a low high low pattern therefore the w bi point and v bi points approaches were used to identify the spatial top and bottom interface of the saline water zone by selecting the most notable rate of change points along the v ctr curves in the study area 4 to characterize the nonlinear relationship between the borehole based tds and v ctr at the same location two modified power functions which fit well with the sample points were developed to predict the tds distribution within the corresponding lca under different hydrological situations more detailed information can be obtained from the planar distribution of the tds transformed from the v ctr by the power functions 5 according to the comprehensive interpretation of the v ctr and associated borehole data the top and bottom interfaces of the saline water zone were quantitatively determined and the aquifer tds based on the hydrogeological system was also quantitatively estimated the integration of the ves data and borehole information into the logging correction process can provide overall characteristics that are consistent with the interface as determined only by the borehole in addition results with a high spatial resolution that matched the density of the v ctr measuring points were provided allowing the reasonable interpretation of some local anomalies 6 the thickness of the surface desalination zone characterized in detail the shallow freshwater resources in coastal areas the depth of the bottom boundary of the saline water layer described the regional dividing line of the range of transgression intensity early pleistocene stripped seawater irrigation channels and the local salinization zone caused by leakage due to overmining operations the tds spatial distribution mainly reflects the current concentration distribution of saline water and reveals the intensity of transgression and the desalination range of yangtze river recharge the detailed information of tds distribution is of great significance to the analysis of water quality trend in coastal areas and the rational development and utilization of groundwater in the future credit authorship contribution statement tongxiao shang software methodology writing original draft zhengwei xu writing
