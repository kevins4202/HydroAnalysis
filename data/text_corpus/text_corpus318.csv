1590,reduction of viral surrogates bacteriophage ms2 and murine norovirus 1 mnv 1 and viruses naturally present in wastewater enteroviruses adenoviruses aichi viruses reovirus pepper mild mottle virus was studied in a long term experiment simulating soil aquifer treatment of a non disinfected secondary treated wastewater effluent blend using a 4 4 m deep saturated soil column 95 sand 4 silt 1 clay with a hydraulic residence time of 15 4 days under predominantly anoxic redox conditions water samples were collected over a four week period from the column inflow and outflow as well as from seven intermediate sampling ports at different depths removal of ms2 was 3 5 log10 over 4 4 m and removal of mnv 1 was 3 log10 over 0 3 m notably mnv 1 was removed to below detection limit within 0 3 m of soil passage in secondary treated wastewater effluent mnv 1 rna and ms2 rna degraded at a first order rate of 0 59 day 1 and 0 12 day 1 respectively in 15 4 days the time to pass the soil column the rna degradation of ms2 would amount to 0 8 log10 and in one day that of mnv 1 0 3 log10 implying that attachment of mnv 1 and ms2 to the sandy soil took place among the indigenous viruses genome copies reductions were observed for aichi virus 4 9 log10 and for pepper mild mottle virus 4 4 log10 this study demonstrated that under saturated flow and predominantly anoxic redox conditions ms2 removal was non linear and could be described well by a power law relation pepper mild mottle virus was removed less than all of the other viruses studied which substantiates field studies at managed aquifer recharge sites suggesting it may be a conservative model tracer for enteric virus transport through soil keywords viruses soil aquifer treatment soil column removal groundwater recharge 1 introduction soil aquifer treatment sat provides a valuable soil based natural treatment process for reduction of chemical and microbial contaminants associated with municipal wastewater effluents used as sources of water in sustainable land based managed aquifer recharge mar systems abel et al 2012 alidina et al 2014 amy and drewes 2007 bekele et al 2011 hoppe jones et al 2010 sat can result in significant reductions of infectious microorganisms in the recharged source water and thus represents an important component for indirect potable reuse applications asano and cotruvo 2004 bekele et al 2011 dillon et al 2009 missimer et al 2011 enteric pathogens i e viruses protozoa and bacteria are generally reduced by a combination of filtration adsorption and inactivation die off as the source water moves through the soil yates and gerba 1998 yates 2002 nevertheless as viruses have great potential for long distance transport through soils and aquifers due to their small size and environmental persistence goyal et al 1984 bitton and harvey 1992 yates 2002 xagoraraki et al 2014 tesson et al 2018 understanding the factors that control virus migration and survival through subsurface formations is critical for proper design and operation of sat facilities multiple factors have been shown to influence the survival and transport of viruses in the subsurface including microbial activity soil type soil properties e g soil particle distribution clay composition ph soil organic content soil solution composition ionic strength flow velocity degree of water saturation presence of colloids temperature and virus type bitton and harvey 1992 yates and yates 1998 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 jin and flury 2002 yates 2002 yet virus adsorption to soil is the most important process for attenuation with most of the actual virus removal due to inactivation and irreversible attachment to soil surfaces having favorable charge characteristics yates et al 1987 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 a detailed knowledge of hydrogeological and geochemical conditions is required to properly link attenuation of viruses to dominant flow and boundary conditions and make meaningful predictions regarding their fate and transport there have been a number of laboratory scale studies investigating the transport behavior of viruses through aquifer material using homogeneous repacked soil columns lance and gerba 1984 corapcioglu et al 1997 jin et al 2000 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 walshe langford et al 2010 frohnert et al 2014 in general the results have been analyzed using models that consider advective dispersive transport and first order microbial retention and release in which the pore water velocity v controls the advective transport and residence time of the microbes in porous media bradford et al 2017 nevertheless one major drawback is that most laboratory scale studies utilized short column systems representing 1 m of soil passage it was shown that inactivation rate coefficients derived from such studies overestimate virus removal in the field by two to three orders of magnitude as the greatest removal of microbial contaminants usually occurs within the first meter of unsaturated soil passage pang 2008 as a result interpolation of inactivation rates over greater distances based on these initial values can lead to inaccurate microbial removal assessment the non linearity of removal with distance may have important consequences for the prediction of virus removal thus also for the calculation of setback distances in sat schemes to ensure adequate treatment of infiltrated source water schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 several authors concluded that meso scale soil column experiments with column length substantially longer than 1 m might bare a suitable compromise to better study the non linear attenuation of viruses during travel through the vadose zone and saturated aquifer representing longer retention times lance and gerba 1984 powelson et al 1990 1991 sobsey et al 1995 frohnert et al 2014 regnery et al 2017 to test this research hypothesis a meso scale soil column system of 4 m length was custom built at the colorado school of mines to investigate the fate and transport of viruses under controlled hydrogeochemical conditions during simulated sat with non disinfected reclaimed water in a long term experiment effluent impacted waters applied for recharge in sat systems usually contain high concentrations of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon doc which serves as an electron donor for soil microorganisms in a typical sat recharge situation a sequence of reduction processes from oxidized conditions in the initial zone of infiltration to reducing conditions in the recharged shallow aquifer will develop over time as a function of travel distance previous experiments simulating sat indicated immediate depletion of dissolved oxygen in secondary treated wastewater effluent during passage through a 1 2 m long soil column operated under unsaturated flow conditions regnery et al 2015 at field scale sat redox conditions may change with hydraulic conditions microbial activity and temperature and are not constant throughout regnery et al 2017 presenting conditions difficult to simulate in the laboratory hence our study focused on the fully saturated and anoxic part of the recharged shallow aquifer in a sat scheme studied viruses included the human viral surrogates bacteriophage ms2 and murine norovirus 1 mnv 1 as well as viruses naturally present in wastewater enterovirus ev adenovirus adv aichi virus aichiv reovirus reov pepper mild mottle virus pmmov ev has been studied the most at sat operations whereas adv aichiv and pmmov are among the most abundant viruses detected in wastewater kitajima et al 2014 reov have been commonly detected in groundwater fout et al 2003 betancourt et al 2014 moreover due to the ubiquitous presence of reov in mammals frequent occurrence in sewage and relative resistance to ambient conditions this virus has been suggested as an indicator of groundwater vulnerability to fecal pollution and consequently to enteric virus contamination betancourt and gerba 2016 bacteriophage ms2 has been used extensively to study virus transport under various soil column and field conditions yates and yates 1991 schijven et al 1999 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 walshe langford et al 2010 frohnert et al 2014 mayotte et al 2017 ms2 is an icosahedral phage with a diameter of 27 nm and with a low isoelectric point pi of 3 5 this virus has been shown to have hydrophobic properties which may influence its transport through soil farkas et al 2015 in addition ms2 has a negative charge and is considered a relatively conservative tracer for virus transport in saturated sandy soils with low organic matter content at ph 6 8 as it shows little or no adsorption under those conditions jin et al 2000 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 mnv 1 is an enteric pathogen in mice that shares many biochemical and genetic features with human noroviruses and therefore is considered a model system to study human norovirus biology wobus et al 2006 mnv 1 has the size 28 to 35 nm in diameter shape icosahedral and buoyant density 1 36 0 04 g cm3 characteristic of human noroviruses human noroviruses in turn are considered important etiologic agents with respect to health risks associated with exposure to recycled water soller et al 2017 although passage through a short unsaturated zone under predominantly oxic conditions was omitted in our experimental setup it was expected that the chosen conditions i e well adapted microbial community 4 4 m of continuous soil passage subsurface residence time of more than two weeks mimic sat field conditions more closely than previous column studies investigating virus transport to determine removal kinetics of enteric virus surrogates during simulated sat mnv 1 was administered as a 24 h pulse spike at the beginning of the experiment whereas coliphage ms2 was continuously spiked to the soil column for 26 days the fate and transport of mnv 1 and ms2 in the soil column were monitored over five days and a four week period respectively their breakthrough curves were determined and were fitted to an advection dispersion model including a lumped term for virus attachment and inactivation using hydrus 1d version 4 16 0110 a software package that simulates one dimensional water flow and solute transport in unsaturated partially saturated or fully saturated porous media šimůnek et al 2005 furthermore additional water samples were collected from the soil column system and were assayed for naturally occurring enteric viruses in the recharged treated wastewater effluent blend to assess their fate during simulated sat 2 material and methods 2 1 soil column configuration and operation the custom built meso scale soil column system consisted of one continuous 4 5 m long polyvinylchloride pvc column with an inner diameter of 0 15 m filled with a blend of 50 50 v v technical sand i e quartz sand and sandy field soil coarse sand with approximately 6 fines sieved to grain size 2 mm from an active full scale sat infiltration basin in colorado united states this allowed for adequate hydraulic properties i e greater hydraulic conductivity than the applied hydraulic loading rate to maintain flow rate and meet retention time requirements as well as biological activity in the column the soil column had been carefully wet packed in 0 1 m incremental depths to prevent layering and achieve a uniform bulk density by stirring and tamping the soil soil depth in the packed column was 4 4 m porosity and hydraulic conductivity of the sand soil mixture were determined to be 0 34 and 0 61 10 4 m s respectively using standard procedures at 20 c laboratory temperature astm 2007a b astm 2009 2011 the proportion of sand silt and clay was 95 4 and 1 respectively grain size analysis was performed in 2012 using standard test method astm d422 astm 2007b thus the sand soil mixture was classified as sand with a soil organic carbon content of 0 3 the ph was 7 7 and cation exchange capacity was estimated to be 5 24 cmol kg the soil column was equipped with seven intermediate sampling ports at various distances along the length of the column with the following depths 0 15 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 8 3 05 and 4 3 m customized stainless steel sampling ports without porous cups were used to avoid sorption effects and to obtain water samples from the center of the column as previously described wang et al 1980 a schematic of the soil column setup is provided in fig 1 the soil column was operated under saturated flow conditions in vertical direction top to bottom at 20 c to simulate the saturated zone of the aquifer during sat the nitrogen purged column feed solution was kept in a 50 l plastic carboy at room temperature and was delivered to the column by a peristaltic masterflex l s pump cole parmer vernon hill il at a constant flow rate of 1 ml min to establish a well adapted microbial community the soil column system received non disinfected secondary treated effluent conventional activated sludge system nitrified denitrified from a wastewater treatment facility in denver co for 6 months during start up one month prior to this study i e december 12 2012 the soil column feed was switched to a blend of nanofiltration permeate and secondary treated effluent at a ratio of 50 50 v v to prevent unforeseen clogging during virus spiking and provide more stable feed water conditions nanofiltration permeate was produced from tap water golden co filtered through a 20 gpm 75 6 l per minute membrane skid equipped with 21 dow filmtec 4040 nf 270 elements midland mi after soil column start up hydraulic retention time hrt was determined in a tracer test based on continuous conductivity readings at the column outlet as well as one intermediate sampling port using potassium bromide as a conservative tracer cxtfit 2 0 toride et al 1995 was used to calculate the tracer s breakthrough curve and to interpolate the hrt of all intermediate sampling ports resulting hrt were 0 5 days 0 15 m 1 day 0 3 m 2 days 0 6 m 3 days 0 9 m 6 1 days 1 8 m 10 4 days 3 05 m 15 3 days 4 3 m and 15 4 days 4 4 m no preferential flow paths through the column were observed during the tracer test however small scale heterogeneities in the packed soil cannot be excluded water samples 100 ml for analysis of bulk organic parameters such as doc ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uv254nm specific uv absorbance suva as well as major ions i e nitrate manganese were collected once a week at the inflow and outflow of the soil column and analyzed subsequently according to standard methods apha 2012 for the purpose of this study classification of redox conditions followed the framework for identifying redox processes in aquifer systems developed by mcmahon and chapelle 2008 as detailed in regnery et al 2015 2 2 indicator virus cultures bacteriophage ms2 american type culture collection atcc 15597 b1 was propagated and assayed by the double agar layer method using escherichia coli atcc 15597 as the host cells adams 1959 briefly virus propagation involved mixing 1 ml of phage stock with 100 ml of log phase e coli grown in 3 tryptic soy broth tsb followed by incubation at 37 c after incubation the culture was centrifuged at 6000 g for 15 min to remove bacterial debris and the resulting supernatant was filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane filters the virus stock obtained through this procedure was aliquoted in 2 ml vials and stored at 80 c until needed mnv 1 s7 pp3 strain kindly provided by dr y tohya nihon university kanagawa japan was propagated in a mouse leukemic monocyte macrophage cell line raw 264 7 american type culture collection tib 71 cannon et al 2006 mnv 1 concentrations were quantified by reverse transcription quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr using 10 fold serial dilutions of a plasmid containing a full length cdna clone of mnv 1 in order to generate a standard curve and to evaluate the sensitivity of the assay betancourt et al 2014 a minimum of 10 copies reaction of the mnv 1 genome could be detected by the rt qpcr assay mnv 1 was also used as a sample process control to monitor the efficiency of viral nucleic acid extraction reverse transcription and qpcr assays betancourt et al 2014 2 3 spiking of indicator viruses during simulated sat throughout this study a strict disinfection and spill prevention protocol was followed to prevent contamination of the samples by the spiked or indigenous viruses present in the wastewater mnv 1 was added to the soil column as a 24 hour pulse at the start of the experiment on january 16 2013 at an average concentration of 106 genome copies gc per ml input while ms2 was continuously added for 26 days at an average concentration of 108 pfu ml input per day the spiking solution was kept at 4 c in a fridge renewed every day and was delivered to the column by a high precision planetary gear driven multi channel ismatec ipc 8 pump wertheim germany at a flow rate of 0 1 ml min mixing of feed and spiking solutions occurred approximately 1 5 m prior to the column inlet a sampling tap on the feed line after the spiking but just before entering the column was used to collect all inflow samples fig 1 all utilized tubing within this study consisted of teflon to minimize losses of pathogens due to sorption effects each of the intermediate sampling ports plus column inflow and outflow were sampled once a day over a period of 15 days after day 15 of the spiking experiment all sampling ports as well as column inflow and outflow were sampled every second day until spiking ended on day 26 in general 10 ml of sample were collected from each sampling location into 15 ml sterile polypropylene centrifuge tubes a drop of fecal calf serum was immediately added to each sample to preserve the ms2 phage during subsequent freezing the frozen samples were shipped overnight on dry ice to the university of arizona s laboratory for analysis 2 4 detection of viruses naturally present in blended secondary treated effluent after receiving blended secondary treated effluent for more than six weeks additional water samples were collected from the soil column on january 26 2013 and assayed for naturally occurring enteric viruses to assess their fate during simulated sat samples from inflow 1 ml seven intermediate sampling ports 1 ml each and outflow 1 l of the soil column were filtered through mixed cellulose esters membrane filters with a 0 45 μm pore size emd millipore to concentrate the viruses following procedures previously described betancourt et al 2014 viral dna adv and rna ev reov aichiv pmmov were extracted from water concentrates 400 μl using the zr viral dna rna kit zymo research irvine ca following the manufacturer s protocol viral rna was reverse transcribed into complementary dna cdna using the high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit applied biosystems foster city ca viral genome copies in the secondary effluent blend were evaluated by qpcr adenovirus or rt qpcr ev reov pmmov following procedures previously described betancourt et al 2014 reov rna was assayed by end point amplification of a conserved region of the viral l1 genome segment leary et al 2002 mnv 1 was used as a process control to monitor the efficiency of viral nucleic acid extraction reverse transcription and qpcr assay from the actual samples relative to molecular biology grade water dnase rnase and protease free which was utilized as a control i e no inhibition to determine the spiked mnv 1 rna concentration briefly 2 0 μl of mnv 1 stock 4 0 104 copies μl was spiked into 200 μl of concentrated wastewater samples and molecular biology grade water mnv 1 rna was co extracted with other indigenous viral nucleic acids from the water samples and the mnv 1 rna yield was determined by rt qpcr to calculate the extraction rt qpcr efficiency e as previously described betancourt et al 2014 schmitz et al 2016 the mnv process control was used to identify viral nucleic acid loss during extraction the occurrence of any rt qpcr inhibition or both qpcr inhibition observed in three of the samples was resolved by 1 5 1 10 or 1 100 dilutions the concentration of naturally occurring viruses in the wastewater samples were estimated by adjusting the concentration with the extraction rt qpcr efficiency e data for each wastewater sample although mnv 1 is a culturable virus the rt qpcr assay instead of cell culture was selected for quantification of mnv 1 genomes in order to minimize the differences in the quantification of other eukaryotic viruses naturally present in treated wastewater effluents the persistence of adv ev reov aichiv and pmmov through sat was evaluated by qpcr as a rapid and effective assay for detection and quantification of virus genomes in the environment the qpcr primers and probes used in the present study for the selected viruses as well as the process control mnv 1 are shown in table 1 the lightcycler 480 real time pcr instrument ii roche applied science indianapolis in was used for the qpcr assays reaction mixtures 25 μl contained 12 5 μl of lightcycler 480 probes master roche diagnostics primers and probes plus 2 5 μl of viral dna or cdna fluorescence data were collected after every cycle and analyzed with lightcycler 480 software version 1 5 roche diagnostics absolute quantification of viruses expressed as viral copy numbers or gene copies were derived from standard curves using tenfold serial dilutions of cdna ev pmmov aichiv mnv 1 or dna adv clones and the roche system based on a second derivative quantification cycle cq determination and nonlinear fit algorithms viral copy numbers from samples unknowns were extrapolated from the corresponding known quantity in the standard curve negative no template controls were included to detect any false positive results due to cross contamination however no false positive qpcr signal was observed the qpcr reactions were performed in triplicate and considered positive when the tube fluoresced with sufficient intensity and the cq was 40 bustin et al 2009 2 5 inactivation of indicator viruses the inactivation rate of mnv 1 and ms2 at room temperature in secondary treated wastewater effluent without porous media contact was assessed over 10 days based on repeated measurements of mnv 1 and ms2 concentration by qpcr for ms2 the inactivation rate was also evaluated by the plaque assay previously described adams 1959 2 6 data analysis breakthrough curves were analyzed by plotting the concentration of viral surrogates against time in days total amounts of detected viral surrogates in the water samples were determined by assessing the areas under the breakthrough curves multiplied by flow rate fitting of the bromide tracer and virus breakthrough curves in the fully saturated porous media was conducted with hydrus 1d version 4 16 0110 šimůnek et al 2005 as the tail of the ms2 breakthrough curve was not monitored after continuous spiking was terminated ms2 detachment could not be evaluated detachment is commonly much slower than attachment schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 and was therefore neglected transport of the spiked viral surrogates was analyzed using an advection dispersion equation including equilibrium sorption and first order removal the governing equation for an advection dispersion model including removal by a combination of attachment and inactivation and neglecting detachment is as follows 1 c t x α l v c x v c x λc subject to boundary conditions c c0 at x 0 and c x 0 at x l where l is the transport length cm c is the concentration of free bacteriophages pfu ml x is the travel distance m α l is the dispersivity m v is the average interstitial water velocity m day λ is the removal rate coefficient day 1 combining attachment and inactivation the dispersivity estimate from the bromide tracer was used to characterize virus transport neglecting dispersivity log10 removal was then calculated from 2 log 10 c t c 0 λ l v 1 ln 10 viral rna degradation of mnv 1 and ms2 in secondary treated wastewater effluent was assumed to proceed at a first order rate the degradation rate coefficient was estimated by first order regression analysis of the log transformed concentration data versus time 3 results 3 1 water quality changes during simulated sat relevant organic water quality parameters in the soil column inflow and outflow and the change in nitrate and dissolved manganese after travel through 4 4 m of soil were measured and are summarized in table 2 the nitrate reduction and dissolved manganese release in combination with the decrease in doc indicated biological activity and predominantly anoxic redox conditions over the entire soil passage of 4 4 m levels of biodegradable doc were in the range of 2 4 mg l and 2 0 mg l respectively on average total ammonia concentrations in the nitrified partial denitrified treated wastewater effluent blend were still 5 0 2 0 mg n l and revealed significant oxygen demand for further nitrification as the feed container was purged with nitrogen gas solely traces of oxygen could have been introduced to the soil column system via diffusion through peristaltic pump tubing and would have been utilized within the first few centimeters of the soil passage without affecting the column s predominant reducing condition highly reducing conditions i e sulfate reduction and methanogenic conditions respectively were not observed in the soil column system 3 2 breakthrough curves of viral surrogates fig 2 shows the observed breakthrough curves plotted with time for ms2 and best fit curves analyzed with hydrus 1d using the one site kinetic sorption model and assuming first order removal eq 1 ms2 was constantly detected in the outflow of the soil column approximately 12 days after the beginning of spiking three days faster than the chemical tracer as described earlier it took the conservative tracer bromide 15 4 days to pass the soil column mnv 1 reached port 2 at 0 3 m depth within one day the calculated breakthrough curves were investigated at a flow velocity darcy of 9 6 cm day from 1 ml min and the diameter of the column a porosity of 0 34 and a low value of dispersivity of 0 87 cm 1 reflecting a narrow grain size distribution with poorly graded particles the corresponding removal rate coefficients λ day 1 of ms2 as a function of travel distance in the soil column are summarized in table 3 the log10 removal data as a function of travel distance were analyzed fig 3 shows the observed removal of ms2 and mnv 1 plotted with travel distance these results suggest that ms2 removal was non linear and could be described by the power law relation indicated above the figure as mnv 1 was removed to below detection limit i e qpcr non detects beyond 0 3 m travel distance its transport behavior could not be determined 3 3 removal of naturally occurring viruses table 4 summarizes the removal of naturally occurring viruses after the soil column was continuously fed with secondary treated effluent nanofiltration permeate 50 50 v v blend for six weeks ev and adv were not detected in the inflow outflow or samples from intermediate sampling ports of the soil column aichiv rna was detected in the inflow and sampling port 1 corresponding to a depth of 15 cm however after this depth there was no further detection indicating an overall reduction of 3 1 log10 99 9 pmmov rna was consistently detected at high levels 107 gc ml in the inflow and the first two sampling ports at 0 15 and 0 3 m depth respectively after longer travel distances i e ports 4 and 5 located at 0 9 and 1 8 m depth respectively low levels 101 102 gc ml of pmmov rna were still detected including the outflow of the soil column indicating an overall reduction that ranged from 1 log 90 to 4 log 95 these results indicate that pmmov was transported much further through the soil column than the other viruses as a consequence pmmov removal was relatively lower than removal of aichiv and ms2 coliphage reov rna was unexpectedly detected in samples collected at a depth of 4 3 m and the outflow as indicated by pcr amplification of viral complementary dna cdna templates however an overall reduction could not be determined since the reov rna was not detected in the influent sample or samples from other intermediate sampling ports 4 discussion 4 1 fate and transport of viral surrogates during sat our study aimed at evaluating the removal of two human viral surrogates including a bacterial virus bacteriophage ms2 and a mammalian virus mnv 1 through a well adapted 4 4 m long soil column under saturated and anoxic conditions with continuous soil passage and residence time of more than two weeks for a long term experiment further operating conditions included continuous dosing of ms2 over the entire runtime of the experiment 26 days and the inclusion of mnv 1 as a 24 hour pulse at the start of the experiment to derive information about removal of a virus surrogate for norovirus in a short term experiment using the advection dispersion equation including equilibrium sorption and first order removal our results indicated that ms2 removal was non linear and could be described by a power law relation mnv 1 removal as previously mentioned could only be observed at the first two ports beyond port 2 mnv 1 was removed to below detection limit the overall removal observed for ms2 was about 3 5 log10 over 4 4 m and almost 3 log10 over 0 3 m for mnv 1 in secondary treated effluent mnv 1 rna degradation was only 0 3 log10 at a first order rate of 0 59 day 1 fig 4 similarly ms2 rna degraded at a first order rate but with a much lower inactivation rate than mnv 1 corresponding to 0 12 day 1 that would amount to 0 8 log10 rna degradation fig 5 these results indicate that mnv 1 and ms2 were inactivated at different rates in secondary treated wastewater at a relatively constant temperature one day was required for mnv 1 to travel 0 3 m indicating that most of the 3 log10 removal was attributable to attachment to the soil grains as observed in recent column experiments under saturated conditions tesson et al 2018 similarly the 3 5 log10 removal of ms2 of over 4 4 m 15 4 days indicates that attachment to soil grains rather than degradation was a major factor controlling the attenuation of this virus by passage through the soil column yates et al 1985 reported inactivation rates of 0 075 to 0 52 log10pfu day abel et al 2012 for ms2 in groundwater samples from five different sites at temperatures between 17 and 23 c no statistical difference between inactivation rate of ms2 poliovirus 1 and echovirus 1 was observed in those studies yates et al concluded that the use of ms2 as a surrogate for animal virus behavior in groundwater would be justified in most cases yates et al 1985 during soil passage the attenuation of virus concentrations is largely due to the combined effect of adsorption and inactivation in addition to advection and dispersion responsible for spreading of viruses yates et al 1987 yates and yates 1991 tesson et al 2018 in our study the apparent faster movement of ms2 in the saturated soil compared to the chemical tracer is most likely due to its transport through larger pores than the solute tracer itself chemical tracers can diffuse into smaller pores slowing their movement and the greater sensitivity of the assay method for viruses one virus can be detected in 1 ml versus solute chemical tracers bales et al 1993 furthermore preferential flow might have occurred within the homogeneously packed soil column similar phenomena have been observed in field studies maier et al 2009 viruses have been observed to travel 100 times faster than solute tracers in non uniform substrata hinsby et al 1996 thus chemical tracers cannot always be relied upon to reflect the transport or retention time for viruses during sat the non linear removal of ms2 with respect to travel distance observed in our study may also be attributed to heterogeneities within the uniform soil as well as within the population of transported virus particles as previously reported schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 a slow power law decay of contaminant concentration with distance due to heterogeneities at the scale of pathogen and filtration rates macroscale heterogeneity was described previously by redman et al 2001 these studies have shown that the relatively slow rate of microbial removal predicted by power law filtration and the uncertain spatial variability in filtration rates caused by macroscale heterogeneity place a greater burden on these other processes as the primary barriers to microbial pathogens the non linearity of removal with distance may have important consequences for prediction of virus removal thus also for the calculation of setback distances that are needed to adequately protect groundwater sources and to ensure adequate treatment of infiltrated surface water schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 studies have indicated that virus soil interactions which are electrostatic and hydrophobic in nature are determined by differences in surface characteristics between viruses and soil particles furthermore surface characteristics can be altered by changes in ph ionic strength multivalent ions and organic matter goyal et al 1984 dowd et al 1998 tesson et al 2018 as colloids viruses appear to be partially attached to other colloidal particles in the aqueous environment which may explain heterogeneity of the adsorptive characteristics of transported virus particles schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 tesson et al 2018 studies examining the co transport of clay colloids and viruses such as ms2 and ɸx174 at two different pore water velocities in laboratory packed columns demonstrated that the presence of clays significantly influenced virus transport ms2 not only exhibited greater affinity than ɸx174 for clays but also its transport was hindered with respect to ɸx174 at the lower pore water velocity syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 the proportion of clay in our soil column did not exceed 1 additional column studies in a long term experiment under anoxic conditions associated low virus removal with less adsorption less inactivation and more detachment of ms2 and ɸx174 frohnert et al 2014 furthermore more extensive removal of viruses and their surrogates e g bacteriophages ms2 and ɸx174 was shown during unsaturated compared to saturated transport in soil column studies jin et al 2000 walshe langford et al 2010 frohnert et al 2014 less removal of ms2 in anoxic aquifers than in oxic aquifers was also reported in studies conducted by van der wielen et al 2008 the results of these studies and our research reveal practical implications about the size and impact of oxic and anoxic zones during subsurface passages and how it should be more emphasized in risk assessment studies aimed to protect drinking water resources from contaminations with human enteric viruses it also highlights the importance of installing much larger protection zones for drinking water wells e g in indirect potable reuse schemes in order to secure against possible viral contamination schijven and hassanizadeh 2002 van der wielen and senden 2008 4 2 behavior of naturally occurring viruses during sat pmmov transport behavior in soil column systems has not been previously examined it was selected for this study as it is consistently present in high numbers in treated wastewater and appears to persist longer in water soil systems than human enteric viruses kitajima et al 2014 rachmadi et al 2016 symonds et al 2018 this plant virus was detected more commonly than human enteric viruses at sat field sites betancourt et al 2014 pmmov is non enveloped rod shaped single stranded rna virus with a normal length of 312 nm by 18 nm wetter et al 1984 representing a relatively larger size compared to most human enteric viruses it has a pi of 3 28 to 3 71 which is lower than the pi of most human enteric viruses 4 5 7 5 the mobility of pmmov through the porous media column may be attributed to a large enough interstitial column velocity that facilitates the alignment of the virion long axis with the effective vertical flow field such a flow alignment through soil may result in preferential flow paths that enhance virus transport in the subsurface this study and our previous study at different sat sites betancourt et al 2014 indicate that pmmov is a conservative tracer of virus transport through aquifer material and therefore suitable for laboratory and field scale studies the present study reveals differences in removal rates for all four viruses analyzed under the studied conditions removal rates during infiltration followed the order of aichiv mnv 1 ms2 pmmov ev and adv were never detected in our study neither in a secondary treated effluent blend used to feed the soil column nor throughout the laboratory scale infiltration process the results of this investigation indicate that pmmov removal was less than removal of the pathogenic virus aichiv and surrogate viruses ms2 and mnv 1 thus quantitative data for pmmov removal may offer a reliable and simple way to monitor virus transport in groundwater environments reov was unexpectedly detected by pcr amplification at the point of soil column outflow collection thereby indicating that this virus could travel through the column system no data are available in terms of reov removal and attenuation during laboratory simulated sat thus pointing towards the need for further research possibly the detection of reov after 4 4 m of soil passage may be due to continuous feeding of the soil column with undiluted non disinfected secondary treated effluent for several months during the startup reov is a double stranded rna virus with a double capsid layer that has been shown to persist longer that some single stranded rna virus after wastewater treatment especially after chlorine disinfection mcdaniels et al 1983 brewster et al 2005 nieuwstad et al 1991 recent studies found reov to be the only infectious enteric virus detected after advanced wastewater treatment and ultrafiltration lim et al 2015 qiu et al 2015 5 conclusions supporting our research hypothesis meso scale soil column systems clearly prove beneficial to study non linear removal of viruses and viral surrogates such as ms2 with respect to travel distance and hrt in sat scenarios furthermore differences in removal rates among viral surrogates and viruses naturally present in treated wastewater effluents recharged during sat were observed which is a reflection of the differences in the physical and chemical structure of the virions mnv 1 is undoubtedly an appropriate virus surrogate for human pathogenic viruses in laboratory studies however additional studies may be required to obtain further information about its transport in repacked soil columns our study demonstrated the effect of adsorption and inactivation in the attenuation of virus concentrations where ms2 removal was more likely attributed to attachment to soil grains rather than to degradation as observed for mnv 1 pmmov a plant virus excreted in large numbers in human feces 109 virions g dry weight fecal matter may be selected as a conservative tracer through aquifer material in laboratory and field scale virus transport studies based on the results obtained in the present study reov warrants further investigation to elucidate aspects of its transport and removal in the subsurface environment because of its common occurrence in disinfected wastewater acknowledgment the authors thank the the water research foundation for its financial technical and administrative assistance in funding and managing the project grant wrrf 10 05

1590,reduction of viral surrogates bacteriophage ms2 and murine norovirus 1 mnv 1 and viruses naturally present in wastewater enteroviruses adenoviruses aichi viruses reovirus pepper mild mottle virus was studied in a long term experiment simulating soil aquifer treatment of a non disinfected secondary treated wastewater effluent blend using a 4 4 m deep saturated soil column 95 sand 4 silt 1 clay with a hydraulic residence time of 15 4 days under predominantly anoxic redox conditions water samples were collected over a four week period from the column inflow and outflow as well as from seven intermediate sampling ports at different depths removal of ms2 was 3 5 log10 over 4 4 m and removal of mnv 1 was 3 log10 over 0 3 m notably mnv 1 was removed to below detection limit within 0 3 m of soil passage in secondary treated wastewater effluent mnv 1 rna and ms2 rna degraded at a first order rate of 0 59 day 1 and 0 12 day 1 respectively in 15 4 days the time to pass the soil column the rna degradation of ms2 would amount to 0 8 log10 and in one day that of mnv 1 0 3 log10 implying that attachment of mnv 1 and ms2 to the sandy soil took place among the indigenous viruses genome copies reductions were observed for aichi virus 4 9 log10 and for pepper mild mottle virus 4 4 log10 this study demonstrated that under saturated flow and predominantly anoxic redox conditions ms2 removal was non linear and could be described well by a power law relation pepper mild mottle virus was removed less than all of the other viruses studied which substantiates field studies at managed aquifer recharge sites suggesting it may be a conservative model tracer for enteric virus transport through soil keywords viruses soil aquifer treatment soil column removal groundwater recharge 1 introduction soil aquifer treatment sat provides a valuable soil based natural treatment process for reduction of chemical and microbial contaminants associated with municipal wastewater effluents used as sources of water in sustainable land based managed aquifer recharge mar systems abel et al 2012 alidina et al 2014 amy and drewes 2007 bekele et al 2011 hoppe jones et al 2010 sat can result in significant reductions of infectious microorganisms in the recharged source water and thus represents an important component for indirect potable reuse applications asano and cotruvo 2004 bekele et al 2011 dillon et al 2009 missimer et al 2011 enteric pathogens i e viruses protozoa and bacteria are generally reduced by a combination of filtration adsorption and inactivation die off as the source water moves through the soil yates and gerba 1998 yates 2002 nevertheless as viruses have great potential for long distance transport through soils and aquifers due to their small size and environmental persistence goyal et al 1984 bitton and harvey 1992 yates 2002 xagoraraki et al 2014 tesson et al 2018 understanding the factors that control virus migration and survival through subsurface formations is critical for proper design and operation of sat facilities multiple factors have been shown to influence the survival and transport of viruses in the subsurface including microbial activity soil type soil properties e g soil particle distribution clay composition ph soil organic content soil solution composition ionic strength flow velocity degree of water saturation presence of colloids temperature and virus type bitton and harvey 1992 yates and yates 1998 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 jin and flury 2002 yates 2002 yet virus adsorption to soil is the most important process for attenuation with most of the actual virus removal due to inactivation and irreversible attachment to soil surfaces having favorable charge characteristics yates et al 1987 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 a detailed knowledge of hydrogeological and geochemical conditions is required to properly link attenuation of viruses to dominant flow and boundary conditions and make meaningful predictions regarding their fate and transport there have been a number of laboratory scale studies investigating the transport behavior of viruses through aquifer material using homogeneous repacked soil columns lance and gerba 1984 corapcioglu et al 1997 jin et al 2000 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 walshe langford et al 2010 frohnert et al 2014 in general the results have been analyzed using models that consider advective dispersive transport and first order microbial retention and release in which the pore water velocity v controls the advective transport and residence time of the microbes in porous media bradford et al 2017 nevertheless one major drawback is that most laboratory scale studies utilized short column systems representing 1 m of soil passage it was shown that inactivation rate coefficients derived from such studies overestimate virus removal in the field by two to three orders of magnitude as the greatest removal of microbial contaminants usually occurs within the first meter of unsaturated soil passage pang 2008 as a result interpolation of inactivation rates over greater distances based on these initial values can lead to inaccurate microbial removal assessment the non linearity of removal with distance may have important consequences for the prediction of virus removal thus also for the calculation of setback distances in sat schemes to ensure adequate treatment of infiltrated source water schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 several authors concluded that meso scale soil column experiments with column length substantially longer than 1 m might bare a suitable compromise to better study the non linear attenuation of viruses during travel through the vadose zone and saturated aquifer representing longer retention times lance and gerba 1984 powelson et al 1990 1991 sobsey et al 1995 frohnert et al 2014 regnery et al 2017 to test this research hypothesis a meso scale soil column system of 4 m length was custom built at the colorado school of mines to investigate the fate and transport of viruses under controlled hydrogeochemical conditions during simulated sat with non disinfected reclaimed water in a long term experiment effluent impacted waters applied for recharge in sat systems usually contain high concentrations of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon doc which serves as an electron donor for soil microorganisms in a typical sat recharge situation a sequence of reduction processes from oxidized conditions in the initial zone of infiltration to reducing conditions in the recharged shallow aquifer will develop over time as a function of travel distance previous experiments simulating sat indicated immediate depletion of dissolved oxygen in secondary treated wastewater effluent during passage through a 1 2 m long soil column operated under unsaturated flow conditions regnery et al 2015 at field scale sat redox conditions may change with hydraulic conditions microbial activity and temperature and are not constant throughout regnery et al 2017 presenting conditions difficult to simulate in the laboratory hence our study focused on the fully saturated and anoxic part of the recharged shallow aquifer in a sat scheme studied viruses included the human viral surrogates bacteriophage ms2 and murine norovirus 1 mnv 1 as well as viruses naturally present in wastewater enterovirus ev adenovirus adv aichi virus aichiv reovirus reov pepper mild mottle virus pmmov ev has been studied the most at sat operations whereas adv aichiv and pmmov are among the most abundant viruses detected in wastewater kitajima et al 2014 reov have been commonly detected in groundwater fout et al 2003 betancourt et al 2014 moreover due to the ubiquitous presence of reov in mammals frequent occurrence in sewage and relative resistance to ambient conditions this virus has been suggested as an indicator of groundwater vulnerability to fecal pollution and consequently to enteric virus contamination betancourt and gerba 2016 bacteriophage ms2 has been used extensively to study virus transport under various soil column and field conditions yates and yates 1991 schijven et al 1999 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 walshe langford et al 2010 frohnert et al 2014 mayotte et al 2017 ms2 is an icosahedral phage with a diameter of 27 nm and with a low isoelectric point pi of 3 5 this virus has been shown to have hydrophobic properties which may influence its transport through soil farkas et al 2015 in addition ms2 has a negative charge and is considered a relatively conservative tracer for virus transport in saturated sandy soils with low organic matter content at ph 6 8 as it shows little or no adsorption under those conditions jin et al 2000 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 mnv 1 is an enteric pathogen in mice that shares many biochemical and genetic features with human noroviruses and therefore is considered a model system to study human norovirus biology wobus et al 2006 mnv 1 has the size 28 to 35 nm in diameter shape icosahedral and buoyant density 1 36 0 04 g cm3 characteristic of human noroviruses human noroviruses in turn are considered important etiologic agents with respect to health risks associated with exposure to recycled water soller et al 2017 although passage through a short unsaturated zone under predominantly oxic conditions was omitted in our experimental setup it was expected that the chosen conditions i e well adapted microbial community 4 4 m of continuous soil passage subsurface residence time of more than two weeks mimic sat field conditions more closely than previous column studies investigating virus transport to determine removal kinetics of enteric virus surrogates during simulated sat mnv 1 was administered as a 24 h pulse spike at the beginning of the experiment whereas coliphage ms2 was continuously spiked to the soil column for 26 days the fate and transport of mnv 1 and ms2 in the soil column were monitored over five days and a four week period respectively their breakthrough curves were determined and were fitted to an advection dispersion model including a lumped term for virus attachment and inactivation using hydrus 1d version 4 16 0110 a software package that simulates one dimensional water flow and solute transport in unsaturated partially saturated or fully saturated porous media šimůnek et al 2005 furthermore additional water samples were collected from the soil column system and were assayed for naturally occurring enteric viruses in the recharged treated wastewater effluent blend to assess their fate during simulated sat 2 material and methods 2 1 soil column configuration and operation the custom built meso scale soil column system consisted of one continuous 4 5 m long polyvinylchloride pvc column with an inner diameter of 0 15 m filled with a blend of 50 50 v v technical sand i e quartz sand and sandy field soil coarse sand with approximately 6 fines sieved to grain size 2 mm from an active full scale sat infiltration basin in colorado united states this allowed for adequate hydraulic properties i e greater hydraulic conductivity than the applied hydraulic loading rate to maintain flow rate and meet retention time requirements as well as biological activity in the column the soil column had been carefully wet packed in 0 1 m incremental depths to prevent layering and achieve a uniform bulk density by stirring and tamping the soil soil depth in the packed column was 4 4 m porosity and hydraulic conductivity of the sand soil mixture were determined to be 0 34 and 0 61 10 4 m s respectively using standard procedures at 20 c laboratory temperature astm 2007a b astm 2009 2011 the proportion of sand silt and clay was 95 4 and 1 respectively grain size analysis was performed in 2012 using standard test method astm d422 astm 2007b thus the sand soil mixture was classified as sand with a soil organic carbon content of 0 3 the ph was 7 7 and cation exchange capacity was estimated to be 5 24 cmol kg the soil column was equipped with seven intermediate sampling ports at various distances along the length of the column with the following depths 0 15 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 8 3 05 and 4 3 m customized stainless steel sampling ports without porous cups were used to avoid sorption effects and to obtain water samples from the center of the column as previously described wang et al 1980 a schematic of the soil column setup is provided in fig 1 the soil column was operated under saturated flow conditions in vertical direction top to bottom at 20 c to simulate the saturated zone of the aquifer during sat the nitrogen purged column feed solution was kept in a 50 l plastic carboy at room temperature and was delivered to the column by a peristaltic masterflex l s pump cole parmer vernon hill il at a constant flow rate of 1 ml min to establish a well adapted microbial community the soil column system received non disinfected secondary treated effluent conventional activated sludge system nitrified denitrified from a wastewater treatment facility in denver co for 6 months during start up one month prior to this study i e december 12 2012 the soil column feed was switched to a blend of nanofiltration permeate and secondary treated effluent at a ratio of 50 50 v v to prevent unforeseen clogging during virus spiking and provide more stable feed water conditions nanofiltration permeate was produced from tap water golden co filtered through a 20 gpm 75 6 l per minute membrane skid equipped with 21 dow filmtec 4040 nf 270 elements midland mi after soil column start up hydraulic retention time hrt was determined in a tracer test based on continuous conductivity readings at the column outlet as well as one intermediate sampling port using potassium bromide as a conservative tracer cxtfit 2 0 toride et al 1995 was used to calculate the tracer s breakthrough curve and to interpolate the hrt of all intermediate sampling ports resulting hrt were 0 5 days 0 15 m 1 day 0 3 m 2 days 0 6 m 3 days 0 9 m 6 1 days 1 8 m 10 4 days 3 05 m 15 3 days 4 3 m and 15 4 days 4 4 m no preferential flow paths through the column were observed during the tracer test however small scale heterogeneities in the packed soil cannot be excluded water samples 100 ml for analysis of bulk organic parameters such as doc ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uv254nm specific uv absorbance suva as well as major ions i e nitrate manganese were collected once a week at the inflow and outflow of the soil column and analyzed subsequently according to standard methods apha 2012 for the purpose of this study classification of redox conditions followed the framework for identifying redox processes in aquifer systems developed by mcmahon and chapelle 2008 as detailed in regnery et al 2015 2 2 indicator virus cultures bacteriophage ms2 american type culture collection atcc 15597 b1 was propagated and assayed by the double agar layer method using escherichia coli atcc 15597 as the host cells adams 1959 briefly virus propagation involved mixing 1 ml of phage stock with 100 ml of log phase e coli grown in 3 tryptic soy broth tsb followed by incubation at 37 c after incubation the culture was centrifuged at 6000 g for 15 min to remove bacterial debris and the resulting supernatant was filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane filters the virus stock obtained through this procedure was aliquoted in 2 ml vials and stored at 80 c until needed mnv 1 s7 pp3 strain kindly provided by dr y tohya nihon university kanagawa japan was propagated in a mouse leukemic monocyte macrophage cell line raw 264 7 american type culture collection tib 71 cannon et al 2006 mnv 1 concentrations were quantified by reverse transcription quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr using 10 fold serial dilutions of a plasmid containing a full length cdna clone of mnv 1 in order to generate a standard curve and to evaluate the sensitivity of the assay betancourt et al 2014 a minimum of 10 copies reaction of the mnv 1 genome could be detected by the rt qpcr assay mnv 1 was also used as a sample process control to monitor the efficiency of viral nucleic acid extraction reverse transcription and qpcr assays betancourt et al 2014 2 3 spiking of indicator viruses during simulated sat throughout this study a strict disinfection and spill prevention protocol was followed to prevent contamination of the samples by the spiked or indigenous viruses present in the wastewater mnv 1 was added to the soil column as a 24 hour pulse at the start of the experiment on january 16 2013 at an average concentration of 106 genome copies gc per ml input while ms2 was continuously added for 26 days at an average concentration of 108 pfu ml input per day the spiking solution was kept at 4 c in a fridge renewed every day and was delivered to the column by a high precision planetary gear driven multi channel ismatec ipc 8 pump wertheim germany at a flow rate of 0 1 ml min mixing of feed and spiking solutions occurred approximately 1 5 m prior to the column inlet a sampling tap on the feed line after the spiking but just before entering the column was used to collect all inflow samples fig 1 all utilized tubing within this study consisted of teflon to minimize losses of pathogens due to sorption effects each of the intermediate sampling ports plus column inflow and outflow were sampled once a day over a period of 15 days after day 15 of the spiking experiment all sampling ports as well as column inflow and outflow were sampled every second day until spiking ended on day 26 in general 10 ml of sample were collected from each sampling location into 15 ml sterile polypropylene centrifuge tubes a drop of fecal calf serum was immediately added to each sample to preserve the ms2 phage during subsequent freezing the frozen samples were shipped overnight on dry ice to the university of arizona s laboratory for analysis 2 4 detection of viruses naturally present in blended secondary treated effluent after receiving blended secondary treated effluent for more than six weeks additional water samples were collected from the soil column on january 26 2013 and assayed for naturally occurring enteric viruses to assess their fate during simulated sat samples from inflow 1 ml seven intermediate sampling ports 1 ml each and outflow 1 l of the soil column were filtered through mixed cellulose esters membrane filters with a 0 45 μm pore size emd millipore to concentrate the viruses following procedures previously described betancourt et al 2014 viral dna adv and rna ev reov aichiv pmmov were extracted from water concentrates 400 μl using the zr viral dna rna kit zymo research irvine ca following the manufacturer s protocol viral rna was reverse transcribed into complementary dna cdna using the high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit applied biosystems foster city ca viral genome copies in the secondary effluent blend were evaluated by qpcr adenovirus or rt qpcr ev reov pmmov following procedures previously described betancourt et al 2014 reov rna was assayed by end point amplification of a conserved region of the viral l1 genome segment leary et al 2002 mnv 1 was used as a process control to monitor the efficiency of viral nucleic acid extraction reverse transcription and qpcr assay from the actual samples relative to molecular biology grade water dnase rnase and protease free which was utilized as a control i e no inhibition to determine the spiked mnv 1 rna concentration briefly 2 0 μl of mnv 1 stock 4 0 104 copies μl was spiked into 200 μl of concentrated wastewater samples and molecular biology grade water mnv 1 rna was co extracted with other indigenous viral nucleic acids from the water samples and the mnv 1 rna yield was determined by rt qpcr to calculate the extraction rt qpcr efficiency e as previously described betancourt et al 2014 schmitz et al 2016 the mnv process control was used to identify viral nucleic acid loss during extraction the occurrence of any rt qpcr inhibition or both qpcr inhibition observed in three of the samples was resolved by 1 5 1 10 or 1 100 dilutions the concentration of naturally occurring viruses in the wastewater samples were estimated by adjusting the concentration with the extraction rt qpcr efficiency e data for each wastewater sample although mnv 1 is a culturable virus the rt qpcr assay instead of cell culture was selected for quantification of mnv 1 genomes in order to minimize the differences in the quantification of other eukaryotic viruses naturally present in treated wastewater effluents the persistence of adv ev reov aichiv and pmmov through sat was evaluated by qpcr as a rapid and effective assay for detection and quantification of virus genomes in the environment the qpcr primers and probes used in the present study for the selected viruses as well as the process control mnv 1 are shown in table 1 the lightcycler 480 real time pcr instrument ii roche applied science indianapolis in was used for the qpcr assays reaction mixtures 25 μl contained 12 5 μl of lightcycler 480 probes master roche diagnostics primers and probes plus 2 5 μl of viral dna or cdna fluorescence data were collected after every cycle and analyzed with lightcycler 480 software version 1 5 roche diagnostics absolute quantification of viruses expressed as viral copy numbers or gene copies were derived from standard curves using tenfold serial dilutions of cdna ev pmmov aichiv mnv 1 or dna adv clones and the roche system based on a second derivative quantification cycle cq determination and nonlinear fit algorithms viral copy numbers from samples unknowns were extrapolated from the corresponding known quantity in the standard curve negative no template controls were included to detect any false positive results due to cross contamination however no false positive qpcr signal was observed the qpcr reactions were performed in triplicate and considered positive when the tube fluoresced with sufficient intensity and the cq was 40 bustin et al 2009 2 5 inactivation of indicator viruses the inactivation rate of mnv 1 and ms2 at room temperature in secondary treated wastewater effluent without porous media contact was assessed over 10 days based on repeated measurements of mnv 1 and ms2 concentration by qpcr for ms2 the inactivation rate was also evaluated by the plaque assay previously described adams 1959 2 6 data analysis breakthrough curves were analyzed by plotting the concentration of viral surrogates against time in days total amounts of detected viral surrogates in the water samples were determined by assessing the areas under the breakthrough curves multiplied by flow rate fitting of the bromide tracer and virus breakthrough curves in the fully saturated porous media was conducted with hydrus 1d version 4 16 0110 šimůnek et al 2005 as the tail of the ms2 breakthrough curve was not monitored after continuous spiking was terminated ms2 detachment could not be evaluated detachment is commonly much slower than attachment schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 and was therefore neglected transport of the spiked viral surrogates was analyzed using an advection dispersion equation including equilibrium sorption and first order removal the governing equation for an advection dispersion model including removal by a combination of attachment and inactivation and neglecting detachment is as follows 1 c t x α l v c x v c x λc subject to boundary conditions c c0 at x 0 and c x 0 at x l where l is the transport length cm c is the concentration of free bacteriophages pfu ml x is the travel distance m α l is the dispersivity m v is the average interstitial water velocity m day λ is the removal rate coefficient day 1 combining attachment and inactivation the dispersivity estimate from the bromide tracer was used to characterize virus transport neglecting dispersivity log10 removal was then calculated from 2 log 10 c t c 0 λ l v 1 ln 10 viral rna degradation of mnv 1 and ms2 in secondary treated wastewater effluent was assumed to proceed at a first order rate the degradation rate coefficient was estimated by first order regression analysis of the log transformed concentration data versus time 3 results 3 1 water quality changes during simulated sat relevant organic water quality parameters in the soil column inflow and outflow and the change in nitrate and dissolved manganese after travel through 4 4 m of soil were measured and are summarized in table 2 the nitrate reduction and dissolved manganese release in combination with the decrease in doc indicated biological activity and predominantly anoxic redox conditions over the entire soil passage of 4 4 m levels of biodegradable doc were in the range of 2 4 mg l and 2 0 mg l respectively on average total ammonia concentrations in the nitrified partial denitrified treated wastewater effluent blend were still 5 0 2 0 mg n l and revealed significant oxygen demand for further nitrification as the feed container was purged with nitrogen gas solely traces of oxygen could have been introduced to the soil column system via diffusion through peristaltic pump tubing and would have been utilized within the first few centimeters of the soil passage without affecting the column s predominant reducing condition highly reducing conditions i e sulfate reduction and methanogenic conditions respectively were not observed in the soil column system 3 2 breakthrough curves of viral surrogates fig 2 shows the observed breakthrough curves plotted with time for ms2 and best fit curves analyzed with hydrus 1d using the one site kinetic sorption model and assuming first order removal eq 1 ms2 was constantly detected in the outflow of the soil column approximately 12 days after the beginning of spiking three days faster than the chemical tracer as described earlier it took the conservative tracer bromide 15 4 days to pass the soil column mnv 1 reached port 2 at 0 3 m depth within one day the calculated breakthrough curves were investigated at a flow velocity darcy of 9 6 cm day from 1 ml min and the diameter of the column a porosity of 0 34 and a low value of dispersivity of 0 87 cm 1 reflecting a narrow grain size distribution with poorly graded particles the corresponding removal rate coefficients λ day 1 of ms2 as a function of travel distance in the soil column are summarized in table 3 the log10 removal data as a function of travel distance were analyzed fig 3 shows the observed removal of ms2 and mnv 1 plotted with travel distance these results suggest that ms2 removal was non linear and could be described by the power law relation indicated above the figure as mnv 1 was removed to below detection limit i e qpcr non detects beyond 0 3 m travel distance its transport behavior could not be determined 3 3 removal of naturally occurring viruses table 4 summarizes the removal of naturally occurring viruses after the soil column was continuously fed with secondary treated effluent nanofiltration permeate 50 50 v v blend for six weeks ev and adv were not detected in the inflow outflow or samples from intermediate sampling ports of the soil column aichiv rna was detected in the inflow and sampling port 1 corresponding to a depth of 15 cm however after this depth there was no further detection indicating an overall reduction of 3 1 log10 99 9 pmmov rna was consistently detected at high levels 107 gc ml in the inflow and the first two sampling ports at 0 15 and 0 3 m depth respectively after longer travel distances i e ports 4 and 5 located at 0 9 and 1 8 m depth respectively low levels 101 102 gc ml of pmmov rna were still detected including the outflow of the soil column indicating an overall reduction that ranged from 1 log 90 to 4 log 95 these results indicate that pmmov was transported much further through the soil column than the other viruses as a consequence pmmov removal was relatively lower than removal of aichiv and ms2 coliphage reov rna was unexpectedly detected in samples collected at a depth of 4 3 m and the outflow as indicated by pcr amplification of viral complementary dna cdna templates however an overall reduction could not be determined since the reov rna was not detected in the influent sample or samples from other intermediate sampling ports 4 discussion 4 1 fate and transport of viral surrogates during sat our study aimed at evaluating the removal of two human viral surrogates including a bacterial virus bacteriophage ms2 and a mammalian virus mnv 1 through a well adapted 4 4 m long soil column under saturated and anoxic conditions with continuous soil passage and residence time of more than two weeks for a long term experiment further operating conditions included continuous dosing of ms2 over the entire runtime of the experiment 26 days and the inclusion of mnv 1 as a 24 hour pulse at the start of the experiment to derive information about removal of a virus surrogate for norovirus in a short term experiment using the advection dispersion equation including equilibrium sorption and first order removal our results indicated that ms2 removal was non linear and could be described by a power law relation mnv 1 removal as previously mentioned could only be observed at the first two ports beyond port 2 mnv 1 was removed to below detection limit the overall removal observed for ms2 was about 3 5 log10 over 4 4 m and almost 3 log10 over 0 3 m for mnv 1 in secondary treated effluent mnv 1 rna degradation was only 0 3 log10 at a first order rate of 0 59 day 1 fig 4 similarly ms2 rna degraded at a first order rate but with a much lower inactivation rate than mnv 1 corresponding to 0 12 day 1 that would amount to 0 8 log10 rna degradation fig 5 these results indicate that mnv 1 and ms2 were inactivated at different rates in secondary treated wastewater at a relatively constant temperature one day was required for mnv 1 to travel 0 3 m indicating that most of the 3 log10 removal was attributable to attachment to the soil grains as observed in recent column experiments under saturated conditions tesson et al 2018 similarly the 3 5 log10 removal of ms2 of over 4 4 m 15 4 days indicates that attachment to soil grains rather than degradation was a major factor controlling the attenuation of this virus by passage through the soil column yates et al 1985 reported inactivation rates of 0 075 to 0 52 log10pfu day abel et al 2012 for ms2 in groundwater samples from five different sites at temperatures between 17 and 23 c no statistical difference between inactivation rate of ms2 poliovirus 1 and echovirus 1 was observed in those studies yates et al concluded that the use of ms2 as a surrogate for animal virus behavior in groundwater would be justified in most cases yates et al 1985 during soil passage the attenuation of virus concentrations is largely due to the combined effect of adsorption and inactivation in addition to advection and dispersion responsible for spreading of viruses yates et al 1987 yates and yates 1991 tesson et al 2018 in our study the apparent faster movement of ms2 in the saturated soil compared to the chemical tracer is most likely due to its transport through larger pores than the solute tracer itself chemical tracers can diffuse into smaller pores slowing their movement and the greater sensitivity of the assay method for viruses one virus can be detected in 1 ml versus solute chemical tracers bales et al 1993 furthermore preferential flow might have occurred within the homogeneously packed soil column similar phenomena have been observed in field studies maier et al 2009 viruses have been observed to travel 100 times faster than solute tracers in non uniform substrata hinsby et al 1996 thus chemical tracers cannot always be relied upon to reflect the transport or retention time for viruses during sat the non linear removal of ms2 with respect to travel distance observed in our study may also be attributed to heterogeneities within the uniform soil as well as within the population of transported virus particles as previously reported schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 a slow power law decay of contaminant concentration with distance due to heterogeneities at the scale of pathogen and filtration rates macroscale heterogeneity was described previously by redman et al 2001 these studies have shown that the relatively slow rate of microbial removal predicted by power law filtration and the uncertain spatial variability in filtration rates caused by macroscale heterogeneity place a greater burden on these other processes as the primary barriers to microbial pathogens the non linearity of removal with distance may have important consequences for prediction of virus removal thus also for the calculation of setback distances that are needed to adequately protect groundwater sources and to ensure adequate treatment of infiltrated surface water schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 studies have indicated that virus soil interactions which are electrostatic and hydrophobic in nature are determined by differences in surface characteristics between viruses and soil particles furthermore surface characteristics can be altered by changes in ph ionic strength multivalent ions and organic matter goyal et al 1984 dowd et al 1998 tesson et al 2018 as colloids viruses appear to be partially attached to other colloidal particles in the aqueous environment which may explain heterogeneity of the adsorptive characteristics of transported virus particles schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 tesson et al 2018 studies examining the co transport of clay colloids and viruses such as ms2 and ɸx174 at two different pore water velocities in laboratory packed columns demonstrated that the presence of clays significantly influenced virus transport ms2 not only exhibited greater affinity than ɸx174 for clays but also its transport was hindered with respect to ɸx174 at the lower pore water velocity syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 the proportion of clay in our soil column did not exceed 1 additional column studies in a long term experiment under anoxic conditions associated low virus removal with less adsorption less inactivation and more detachment of ms2 and ɸx174 frohnert et al 2014 furthermore more extensive removal of viruses and their surrogates e g bacteriophages ms2 and ɸx174 was shown during unsaturated compared to saturated transport in soil column studies jin et al 2000 walshe langford et al 2010 frohnert et al 2014 less removal of ms2 in anoxic aquifers than in oxic aquifers was also reported in studies conducted by van der wielen et al 2008 the results of these studies and our research reveal practical implications about the size and impact of oxic and anoxic zones during subsurface passages and how it should be more emphasized in risk assessment studies aimed to protect drinking water resources from contaminations with human enteric viruses it also highlights the importance of installing much larger protection zones for drinking water wells e g in indirect potable reuse schemes in order to secure against possible viral contamination schijven and hassanizadeh 2002 van der wielen and senden 2008 4 2 behavior of naturally occurring viruses during sat pmmov transport behavior in soil column systems has not been previously examined it was selected for this study as it is consistently present in high numbers in treated wastewater and appears to persist longer in water soil systems than human enteric viruses kitajima et al 2014 rachmadi et al 2016 symonds et al 2018 this plant virus was detected more commonly than human enteric viruses at sat field sites betancourt et al 2014 pmmov is non enveloped rod shaped single stranded rna virus with a normal length of 312 nm by 18 nm wetter et al 1984 representing a relatively larger size compared to most human enteric viruses it has a pi of 3 28 to 3 71 which is lower than the pi of most human enteric viruses 4 5 7 5 the mobility of pmmov through the porous media column may be attributed to a large enough interstitial column velocity that facilitates the alignment of the virion long axis with the effective vertical flow field such a flow alignment through soil may result in preferential flow paths that enhance virus transport in the subsurface this study and our previous study at different sat sites betancourt et al 2014 indicate that pmmov is a conservative tracer of virus transport through aquifer material and therefore suitable for laboratory and field scale studies the present study reveals differences in removal rates for all four viruses analyzed under the studied conditions removal rates during infiltration followed the order of aichiv mnv 1 ms2 pmmov ev and adv were never detected in our study neither in a secondary treated effluent blend used to feed the soil column nor throughout the laboratory scale infiltration process the results of this investigation indicate that pmmov removal was less than removal of the pathogenic virus aichiv and surrogate viruses ms2 and mnv 1 thus quantitative data for pmmov removal may offer a reliable and simple way to monitor virus transport in groundwater environments reov was unexpectedly detected by pcr amplification at the point of soil column outflow collection thereby indicating that this virus could travel through the column system no data are available in terms of reov removal and attenuation during laboratory simulated sat thus pointing towards the need for further research possibly the detection of reov after 4 4 m of soil passage may be due to continuous feeding of the soil column with undiluted non disinfected secondary treated effluent for several months during the startup reov is a double stranded rna virus with a double capsid layer that has been shown to persist longer that some single stranded rna virus after wastewater treatment especially after chlorine disinfection mcdaniels et al 1983 brewster et al 2005 nieuwstad et al 1991 recent studies found reov to be the only infectious enteric virus detected after advanced wastewater treatment and ultrafiltration lim et al 2015 qiu et al 2015 5 conclusions supporting our research hypothesis meso scale soil column systems clearly prove beneficial to study non linear removal of viruses and viral surrogates such as ms2 with respect to travel distance and hrt in sat scenarios furthermore differences in removal rates among viral surrogates and viruses naturally present in treated wastewater effluents recharged during sat were observed which is a reflection of the differences in the physical and chemical structure of the virions mnv 1 is undoubtedly an appropriate virus surrogate for human pathogenic viruses in laboratory studies however additional studies may be required to obtain further information about its transport in repacked soil columns our study demonstrated the effect of adsorption and inactivation in the attenuation of virus concentrations where ms2 removal was more likely attributed to attachment to soil grains rather than to degradation as observed for mnv 1 pmmov a plant virus excreted in large numbers in human feces 109 virions g dry weight fecal matter may be selected as a conservative tracer through aquifer material in laboratory and field scale virus transport studies based on the results obtained in the present study reov warrants further investigation to elucidate aspects of its transport and removal in the subsurface environment because of its common occurrence in disinfected wastewater acknowledgment the authors thank the the water research foundation for its financial technical and administrative assistance in funding and managing the project grant wrrf 10 05

areas is influenced by multi phase interfacial retention phenomena conceptually interfacial adsorption results in retardation of pfca velocities in subsurface multiphase systems however site hydrochemical factors influencing interfacial adsorption are not yet fully elucidated herein air water and napl water interfacial tension isotherms were prepared for six homologous pfcas of environmental significance for deionized water and five synthetic groundwaters of increasing ionic strength the isotherms were successfully modeled by the langmuir szyskowski equation and parameters used to fit the measured data are provided concentration dependent interfacial adsorption coefficients and retardation factors are also provided for each pfca and ionic strength condition and are evaluated to assess their significance simplifying relationships for predicting interfacial adsorption based on pfca chain length were found to be less appropriate for natural groundwaters that contain a mixture of dissolved divalent and monovalent ions air water interfacial awi adsorption increased in a threshold manner with ionic strength from 0 to 6 mm whereafter further adsorption was marginal pfca retention within water unsaturated porous media is shown to depend on a number of inter related factors and conditions that complicate the use of retardation factors within analytical

adsorption napl water interfacial adsorption 1 introduction the extensive use of aqueous film forming foams afff for fuel fire suppression and releases during equipment testing and training activities since the 1960 s has resulted in widespread contamination of groundwater resources surface waters and soils by per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas at both military and civilian facilities e g moody and field 2000 moody et al 2003 filipovic et al 2015 anderson et al 2016 afff formulations are a complex mixture of chemicals that can include 1 4 w w pfas and is supplied as a solution concentrate that is typically diluted to a 3 6 v v for use in fire suppression when released at ground surface afff solutions can infiltrate into the shallow subsurface allowing pfas contamination to initially transport through a vadose zone where pfas can be retained before impacting groundwater in some locations the vadose zone extends just a few feet below ground surface however at release locations in the western and southwestern united states us the extent of the vadose zone can be significant e g hundreds of feet providing conditions for longer term retention of these chemicals in the vadose zone environment the potential for pfas in the vadose zone to serve as a long term source of groundwater contamination has been recently identified from field scale evaluations shin et al 2011 xiao et al 2015 weber et al 2017 anderson et al 2019 for example based on site data weber et al 2017 concluded that pfas contamination within the vadose zone beneath a former military fire training area continues to be a source of groundwater contamination some 18 years after training operations had ceased pfas are also components of many industrial waste and consumer products that can leach and transport within both water saturated and unsaturated portions of municipal and commercial landfills which can also serve as a long term source of groundwater contamination therefore it is important to understand and characterize the mechanisms of transport of pfas within the vadose zone environment to better assist risk based assessments and remedial action decision making pfas of interest in our research are the perfluoroalkyl acids pfaa and specific to this current work the perfluoroalkyl carboxylates pfcas which are anionic surface active agents i e surfactants these chemicals have been identified as both components of some current and legacy afff formulations and degradation products of precursory afff components moody and field 2000 houtz et al 2013 weber et al 2017 pfaa retardation during transport in the vadose zone can occur as a result of a combination of retention mechanisms including adsorption to soil surfaces as mineral adorption or association with bound organic phases higgins and luthy 2006 guelfo and higgins 2013 and adsorption to air water interfaces awis within the water unsaturated porous matrix brusseau 2018 lyu et al 2018 partitioning from the aqueous phase to the soil gas phase is not considered to be of significance for the pfcas as these compounds will be dissolved as anions under typical environmental ph conditions when in dilute solution goss 2008 vierke et al 2013 for afff source zones pfas partitioning to co disposed non aqueous phase liquids napl e g hydrocarbon fuels and or solvents and adsorption at napl interfaces have also been suggested as a potentially significant pfas retention mechanisms guelfo and higgins 2013 mckenzie et al 2016 while awi and napl water interfacial nwi adsorption has been considered in the recent environmental literature the significance of these retention mechanisms to the transport of pfas in real vadose zone environment remains ambiguous brusseau 2018 presented a comprehensive retention model for pfas that included the retention contributions of solid phase sorption awi nwi adsorption partitioning between the aqueous and gas phases and napl water partitioning this modeling approach and its component processes was developed and evaluated by many researchers during the 1990s and early 2000s to describe hydrocarbon and hydrocarbon based surfactant fate and transport e g brusseau 1992 brusseau et al 1997 kim et al 1997 silva 1997 kim et al 1998 costanza and brusseau 2000 kim et al 2001 silva et al 2002 and was recently modified by brusseau 2018 to describe pfas retention in porous media specific to awi adsorption brusseau 2018 demonstrated that this mechanism alone could account for up to 50 of the total retardation of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa for an assumed constant volumetric moisture content and awi area condition likewise lyu et al 2018 performed unsaturated column experiments to demonstrate that awi adsorption alone accounted for 50 75 of the total retardation of pfoa depending on the aqueous concentration of pfoa which in this case ranged between 0 01 and 1 mg l using awi adsorption coefficients k ia developed from surface tension isotherm data extracted from a figure originally presented by lunkenheimer et al 2015 for the c6 c11 pfca homologues sodium salts lyu et al 2018 go on to demonstrate that awi adsorption as a mechanism for retention is significant only for pfcas c8 however this result is somewhat misleading as the data used to develop the adsorption coefficients were for pfca solutions prepared in deionized water it is well known that solution ionic strength and ionic composition affects and often enhances the degree of adsorption of both ionized hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon surfactants at the awi downes et al 1995 kissa 2001 gurkov et al 2005 with respect to nwi adsorption the significance of this mechanism and its contribution to the overall retention of pfas in vadose zone and saturated zone is less certain while it has been shown that perfluorocarbon surfactants exhibit some affinity for hydrocarbon water surfaces mukerjee and handa 1981 little experimental data exists to properly evaluate nwi adsorption for specific napls associated with afff training areas e g trichloroethene tce and diesel aviation fuels further as a part of parameterizing their aforementioned model brusseau 2018 addressed nwi adsorption by assuming nwi adsorption coefficients k ni and k ia values were equivalent based on ancillary observations of adsorption coefficient equivalence for hydrocarbon surfactants using a constant nwi area a ni and the same soil moisture conditions assumed for the awi calculation this analysis indicated that nwi partitioning provided a 15 contribution to the total retardation of pfoa in this system however the assumption of equivalent nwi and awi adsorption coefficients is not entirely satisfying given that previous research has demonstrated that nwi adsorption of both hydrocarbon surfactants i e sodium dodecyl sulfate and pfca surfactants on non polar napl surfaces are less than that observed for adsorption at the awi mukerjee and handa 1981 gurkov et al 2005 although brusseau 2018 acknowledge the potential for disparity between k ia and k ni values for perfluorocarbon surfactants based on physicochemical property differences additional research is needed to rightly quantify nwi adsorption coefficients to support fate and transport calculations at pfas source areas in this present work we address the limitations existing within the current literature dataset relating to fluid fluid interfacial adsorption and its significance as a mechanism of retention within water unsaturated porous media aqueous surface tension isotherms were prepared for 6 homologous pfcas and 5 simulated groundwaters of varying ionic strength nwi tension isotherms were also prepared for tce and kerosene as napl phases with kerosene serving as a surrogate for aviation type fuels commonly used at afff training sites concentration dependent k ia and k ni values are presented and used to demonstrate the significance of awi and nwi adsorption as a source of retention and their impact on transport and storage of these contaminants in the vadose zone a discussion of the applicability of the retardation factor for estimating pfca transport in water unsaturated porous media is provided finally a possible framework for implementing interfacial adsorption in unsaturated flow and transport models is presented 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials except for kerosene all chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich co and used without further purification perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea 97 purity perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa 98 perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa 99 purity pfoa 96 purity perfluorononanoic acid pfna 97 purity and perfluorodecanoic acid pfda 95 purity were selected as representative linear pfcas the free acid form of these pfcas were selected to mirror that produced in situ by the degradation and or oxidation of precursor compounds deionized di water used in this work conformed to the american society for testing and materials astm type ii specification sodium bicarbonate nahco3 calcium sulfate caso4 2h2o magnesium sulfate mgso4 and potassium chloride kcl salts were used to prepare solutions of simulated groundwater sgw tce acs reagent grade and kerosene 1 k grade were used for nwi measurements 2 2 methods 2 2 1 solutions preparation sgw solutions were prepared from di water in batches representing five different ionic strengths as shown in table 1 the range of water quality parameters was selected to mimic a range of values typical of natural groundwaters u s environmental protection agency epa 2002 from these solutions individual pfca test solution stamdards were prepared within 100 ml high density polyethylene bottles the preparations slowly agitated for 48 h prior to use di water pfca standards were also similarly prepared nwi standards were prepared by adding 15 ml of napl and 15 ml of aqueous pfca solution into 60 ml clear glass jars tce pfca solution standards were prepared by first adding tce to the jar followed by pfca solution to the tce surface conversely the kerosene pfca standards were prepared by adding the aqueous pfca solutions to the test jars first followed by kerosene as the less dense phase the dual phase preparations were allowed to stabilize for a period of 48 h prior to use 2 2 2 aqueous surface tension measurements and awi adsorption coefficients surface tension measurements were made with a du nouy ring tensiometer fisher surface tensiomat model 21 fisher scientific using standard ring methods astm standard d1331 1989 the tensiometer was calibrated using manufacturer recommended methods measurements were repeated over the course of one hour until the measured tension deviated within 1 across three consecutive measurements measurements were made using solution standards prepared to characterize complete surface tension isotherms up to and including the monomer solubility limit as determined from surface tension measurement stabilization however given that the observed range of pfca concentration values observed at pfas impacted sites is much less than the solubility limit for these surfactants the range of tension values for pfca concentrations between 0 and 100 mg l are presented within this range of concentrations solution ph did not fall below a value of 6 in all cases the results of these measurements were used to construct isotherms of surface tension γ versus bulk aqueous concentration c w the following form of the langmuir szyszkowski ls equation was selected to fit the data as adamson and gast 1997 1 γ γ 0 b ln 1 c w a where γ 0 is the surface tension of water at the ionic strength of interest and a and b are fitting parameters eq 1 was fit to the data utilizing the microsoft excel solver function i e generalized reduced gradient method and minimizing the sum of the squared error between measured and predicted values the data fit was then used in all further analyses as it provided a data set of higher resolution for calculating interfacial parameters awi adsorption coefficients k ia units or cm3 cm2 or cm were calculated using the following form of the gibbs equation kim et al 1997 szymczyk and janczuk 2007 2 k ia γ c w 1 rt δγ δ c w t where γ is the surface concentration mole or mass per unit area r is the universal gas constant and t is the temperature of measurement this procedure involved calculating the incremental change in the slope of the fitted tension isotherm data i e δγ δc w across the range of solution concentrations of interest and applying eq 2 lyu et al 2018 have previously demonstrated by comparison with the results of transport experiments that measured surface tension isotherms can be used to predict awi adsorption coefficients and estimate retardation factors for awi adsorption in porous media with respect to the data fit it should be noted that this approach utilizes measured data at higher aqueous concentrations and the surface tension of water at zero pfca concentration to anchor the fit of the ls equation thereafter the approach relies on model interpolation to ultimately calculate interfacial adsorption parameters at concentrations below the limit of discernment in surface tension measurement i e 5 mg l for pfpea pfhxa and pfhpa 1 mg l for pfoa 0 1 mg l for pfna and pfda therefore it is assumed that the ls equation continues to appropriately describe surface tension reductions due to awi adsorption at lower concentrations consistent with those observed at field sites 2 2 3 nwi tension measurements nwi tension measurements were also performed using standard ring methods astm standard d1331 1989 and the same du nouy ring tensiometer referenced in section 2 2 2 briefly the measurement method consisted of positioning the du nouy ring within the pfca solution phase and in the case of kerosene slowly lifting the ring into the nwi and recording the measured tension required to rupture the interface similarly the tce pfca solution systems recorded the tension required to rupture the interface when a downward force is applied on the interface i e du nouy ring pushed into tce phase the ls equation eq 1 was again used to fit the measured data with γ 0 in the present case being the interfacial tension of the napl water system in the absence of pfca concentration dependent k ni values were again determined from the eq 1 fit to the measured data using eq 2 and the procedure described in section 2 2 2 2 2 4 evaluating awi retention in porous media the retardation factor r f describing the contribution of awi partitioning under water unsaturated flow in the vadose zone is as follows kim et al 1998 3 r f 1 k ia a ia θ w 1 k ia a ia s w n where a ia is the area of the awi within a given volume of water unsaturated soil cm2 cm3 or cm 1 θ w is the volumetric water content s w is the water saturation and n is the media porosity here r f 1 indicates pfca retention due to awi adsorption is absent or negligible for water unsaturated porous media previous research has shown a ia to continue to increase with decreasing s w until achieving a maximum value near the specific surface area of the solid at extremely low s w e g kakare and fort 1996 kim et al 1997 silva 1997 brusseau et al 1997 kim et al 1999 silva et al 2002 costanza robinson and brusseau 2002 peng and brusseau 2005 the following a ia s w relationship was used in this evaluation peng and brusseau 2005 4 a ia s 1 α s w a b c where s is the specific solid surface area and α b and c are fitting parameters which in this case s 5200 cm 1 α 19 78 b 1 1 c 104 and a 1 2 b parameters used by lyu et al 2018 were also directly used to calculate retardation factors i e a ia 73 cm 1 and s w 0 77 or θ w 0 23 in this work for comparative purposes a graphical representation of this a ia s w relationship for a model sand is provided as fig 1a a similar a ia s w function was implemented within the hydrus unsaturated flow and transport model for simulating environmental colloid interactions with the a ia during transient drainage and imbibition cycles bradford et al 2015 2 2 5 evaluating nwi adsorption and transport retardation the r f describing the contribution of nwi adsorption under water unsaturated flow in the vadose zone is as follows saripalli et al 1998 5 r f 1 k ni a ni θ w 1 k ni a ni s w n where k ni is the nwi adsorption coefficient cm and a ni is the area of the nwi in this evaluation napl contamination occurs as entrapped napl ganglia within the porous media as the non wetting fluid in a typical vadose zone environment only a small fraction of the total napl area will be exposed to the convecting aqueous phase than would be the case for the awi at the same soil moisture condition therefore the dependence of interfacial area on s w for the nwi will differ from that of the awi to facilitate this evaluation the following a ni s w relationship was derived from the main imbibition curve of the computed microtomography measurements for napl at residual saturation for the data presented by porter et al 2010 as 6 a ni d e s w f s w where d e and f are fitting parameters which in this case were d 10 4 e 1 5 and f 1 5 napl saturation was at residual or 10 as estimated based on reported properties of the sand a graphical representation of this dataset and the eq 6 fit to the data used in subsequent calculations is provided as fig 1b 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface tension and awi adsorption examples of the surface tension isotherms developed in this work are presented in fig 2 for the di water solutions and two sgw solutions representing the lowest and highest ionic strengths used in this work the solid lines in fig 2 are the modeled tension isotherms resulting from the fit to the measured data the results of data fitting including fitting parameters and goodness of fit statistics are presented as in table 2 eq 1 was found to well represent the measured surface tension isotherms across the range of pfca solution concentrations utilized to our knowledge k ia values for pfca contaminants in solutions representing natural groundwater geochemistry have not yet been reported complete pfca specific surface tension isotherms can be reproduced using the a and b parameters presented in table 2 and eq 1 the high concentration limit is where c w provides the minimum tension γ min and the low concentration limit being c w 0 k ia values can then be determined at a specific aqueous concentration of interest from the slope of the isotherm at that concentration and eq 2 these surface tension isotherms have value not only for the purposes of this presentation but also for environmental calculations involving estimating pfca mass associated with aqueous aerosols or potential removal efficiencies for remediation technologies that rely on awi adsorption to air bubbles to remove pfca mass from the aqueous phase the results presented in fig 2 exhibit some anticipated trends measured aqueous surface tensions were observed to decrease with increasing pfca solution concentration and with increasing number of cf2 groups comprising the monomer chain i e increasing pfca chain length or carbon number c n for these homologous chemicals the corresponding dependence of k ia on pfca concentration is also provided in fig 2 k ia values are shown to decrease with increasing pfca concentration this trend may initially seem counter intuitive when considering γ increases with increasing concentration however as k ia represents the equilibrium condition between the pfca adsorbed at the awi and that dissolved within the bulk aqueous phase at very low concentration small increases in c w result in larger increases in γ which by eq 2 provides a larger k ia awi adsorption was also observed to increase with increasing sgw ionic strength this result is generally attributed to a hydrophobic effect that combines a reduction in bulk aqueous solubility of the amphiphile and decreased electrostatic repulsion of the ionic portion of the amphiphile when positioned at the awi gurkov et al 2005 the effect of dissolved electrolytes on surface tension is well known for surfactants and is readily observed in fig 2 additional observations related to solution ionic strength and pfca interfacial adsorption will be addressed in greater detail in a subsequent section a summary of k ia values calculated from the surface tension isotherm data developed in this work is provided as table 3 for a 1 mg l pfca solution concentration the 1 mg l concentration was selected for comparison with previous work and generally represents the upper range of values observed at field sites for pfcas e g fire training areas at naval air station fallon nv and tyndall air force base fl moody and field 1999 while there is currently a limited published data set from which to compare these results lyu et al 2018 presented k ia values for pfoa prepared in 0 01 m nacl solution and di water 2 0 10 3 cm and 9 55 10 3 cm per the reported regression equation respectively that are very similar to those presented in table 3 where sgw 1 ionic strength was 0 006 m the regression equation presented by lyu et al 2018 i e logk ia 0 56c n 7 5 described the dependence of k ia on c n for a homologous series of pfca sodium salts solutions prepared in di water that were derived from data originally presented by lunkenheimer et al 2015 the results of this regression equation are presented in fig 3a along with the k ia c n relationships developed for the current dataset for the di water cases calculated k ia values present log linearly with increasing c n as shown the slope of the log k ia c n relationship for the di water solutions prepared in the current work deviates from that prepared by lyu et al 2018 we attribute this difference to counterion effects and the use of pfca sodium salts by lunkenheimer et al 2015 in contrast log k ia c n for the sgw solutions exhibit a positive deviation from a log linear trend that increases slightly with increasing c n between c n 5 and 9 beyond c n 9 the log k ia c n appears to plateau repeated solutions preparation and subsequent surface tension measurements indicate the reduced awi adsorption for pfda is real for all sgw solutions it is possible that impurities in the pfca reagents selected could have contributed to these results however given the linearity observed in the log k ia c n relationship for the di water cases the observed deviation from log linearity observed for the sgw solutions is more likely related to the presence of dissolved ions in solution and concomitant electrostatic effects at the awi while the exact mechanism responsible for this observed behavior is not entirely clear some explanation can be gleaned from a few relevant literature sources for example lunkenheimer et al 2015 using highly purified sodium pfca homologues observed a non linear increasing trend in the free energy of awi adsorption g 0 ads with increasing c n that may help to explain some of the non linearity in the sgw log k ia c n function these authors argued that the non linearity in the g 0 ads c n relationship was due to variability in the debye screening length of the electrostatic double layer established at the awi that allows an incrementally increasing adsorption with increasing pfca c n that is in excess of that due to amphiphilic nature of these molecules alone as shown in fig 3b this incrementally increasing adsorption phenomenon may be occurring for the sgw cases for comparison with the present work g 0 ads was calculated as lunkenheimer et al 2015 7 g 0 ads rt ln a l where a l is the surface activity determined as fitting parameter a in the eq 1 fits to the surface tension isotherms in the absence of a counterion electrolyte the g 0 ads c n relationship for the free acid pfcas presents as a linear function across the range of c n investigated however in the presence of available counterions a similar degree of upward curvature is observed in both datasets in fig 3b g 0 ads is enhanced for the sgw solutions in response to the elevated ionic strength of the sgw solutions additionally the lunkenheimer et al 2015 dataset presented in fig 3b combines the results for both even and odd numbered pfca amphiphile carbon numbers which were presented separately in their original manuscript these authors further demonstrated variability in the magnitude of pfca awi adsorption that is dependent on whether the pfca contains an even or odd number of carbons in the chain psillakis et al 2009 also observed differing degrees of awi adsorption for both the pfcas and perfluoro n alkyl sulfonates when c n was odd or even these results suggest that an additional cause of the non linearity observed in the sgw log k ia c n dataset may be related to inherent differences in surface activity between odd and even homologues that manifest more intensely when an excess of dissolved ions are present in solution irrespective of the actual mechanism s at work here the current results provide additional evidence that log linear k ia c n relationships may not be appropriate to predict awi adsorption in natural groundwaters that contain a mixture of divalent and monovalent ions in solution 3 1 1 effect of sgw ionic strength on awi adsorption the sgw solutions used in this work were selected to include the major ionic species found in natural waters and to cover a reasonably representative range of groundwater ionic strength within the limits of measurement awi adsorption was observed to increase with increasing ionic strength and is consistent with the hydrophobic effect described previously however the effects of amphiphile hydrophobicity appears to have a limit for the sgw solutions used in this work in that the rate of change of adsorption decreased markedly once a threshold ionic strength condition was achieved this threshold condition is best observed in fig 4 where the calculated k ia values are plotted against the ionic strength of the bulk aqueous solution for pfpea and pfhxa k ia values were found to be less sensitive to changes in ionic strength within the range of values investigated however for pfcas of higher c n a clear threshold ionic strength condition exists above which the rate of further increases in k ia is marginal gurkov et al 2005 observed a similar threshold stabilization for the aqueous surface adsorption of sodium dodecyl sulfate in nacl solutions when the concentration of nacl exceeded 0 01 m this result is significant in that it potentially simplifies modeling of the effect of ionic strength i on k ia for example given the results presented in fig 4 k ia i could be modeled directly using a langmuir like expression however as will be discussed in section 3 3 an alternative approach that utilizes relationships developed between the ls equation parameters is of more practical value further gurkov et al 2005 described an additional simplification that suggests normalization of the effect of i on interfacial adsorption parameters can be achieved by re evaluating the surface tension isotherms in terms of the mean ionic activity the solutions we are currently evaluating this approach for the sgw results presented herein 3 1 2 potential significance of awi retention for pfcas within vadose zone soils awi adsorption specific retardation factors calculated using eq 3 and the k ia values in table 3 are presented in fig 5a for di water and sgw 1 and sgw 5 solutions as a function of c n the analysis utilized the same soil moisture condition and corresponding a ia used by lyu et al 2018 the r f c n relationship developed from the regression equation presented by lyu et al 2018 is also provided for comparison for these pfcas and for all datasets presented in fig 5a awi retention is observed to be minimal for c n 6 awi retardation is considerably increased for the sgws relative to the di water cases due to the increased interfacial adsorption observed for these sgws this result is significant and highlights the importance of accounting for groundwater ionic strength when attempting to predict awi retention for the sgw cases r f values for the higher carbon number homologues are shown to range between 5 and 20 as was observed for the log k ia c n relationship the predicted sgw r f c n relationship deviates from its smoothly increasing function at c n 9 in response to the stabilization of surface tension observed for the pfda isotherms for all sgws similar surface tension stabilization effects were observed for measurements utilizing perfluorododecanoic acid c n 12 data not shown r f values presented in fig 5a were calculated for a single soil moisture condition and a pfca concentration of 1 mg l additionally the moisture content condition in this analysis is quite high i e θ w 0 23 or 77 of the total pore volume assuming a porosity of 0 3 for the sand therefore the results presented in fig 5a provides a limited assessment of the degree of awi retention possible to provide a more comprehensive evaluation k ia values determined for sgw 1 table 2 were used to estimate awi adsorption specific r f values for soil moisture conditions ranging from s w 0 77 to 0 17 the assigned residual moisture condition for this hypothetical sand the results presented in fig 5b demonstrate the range of r f values possible for these pfcas as a ia changes with changes in s w for a 1 mg l pfca solution concentration for example at s w 0 77 a condition potentially met when and while water infiltrates into a volume of vadose zone the r f for pfoa is 1 9 whereas r f increases by at most a factor of 24 at the residual moisture condition r f values estimated for the higher carbon number pfca homologues at residual moisture were determined to range between 407 and 723 given the results presented in fig 5b it is clear that these pfcas should experience a wide range of r f values within the vadose zone during a given infiltration event where imbibition and subsequent drainage processes would cause the a ia to vary considerably during the event furthermore during an infiltration event it is likely that the concentration of surfactant in the mobile phase i e convecting aqueous phase will vary resulting in variability in k ia values temporally and spatially the interplay between these variables complicates the typical use of r f values via eq 3 e g to directly predict the time of arrival of contaminant at a particular depth in soil for water unsaturated flow generally the application of a r f to characterize the transport of a surface active chemical under water unsaturated flow at field scale is an ill considered chromatography problem in which i the area of the reactive stationary phase in question i e the awi is not constant spatially or temporally under typical field conditions ii phase transfer is concentration dependent and non linear and iii flow of mobile phase is not constant but rather dynamic and intermittent this may explain why methods successfully utilizing surface active tracers to characterize a ia under water unsaturated flow conditions are typically performed at high and constant water saturation where variability in a ia is minimized and uniform flow can be maintained within the porous medium and where the surface active tracer is introduced at a step input to maintain constant tracer concentration numerical methods are likely better suited to resolve the complexity of variables that govern the transport of surface active contaminants under water unsaturated flow conditions 3 2 potential significance of nwi adsorption and retention napl water interfacial isotherms for each pfca prepared for tce and kerosene as napl phases are presented in fig 6 again complete nwi adsorption isotherms were prepared and eq 1 was used to fit the data nwi isotherms were prepared for a single sgw composition i e sgw 2 as a similar relative surface interfacial tension response to ionic strength was expected for both the awi and nwi the results of eq 1 fits to the measured data are provided in table 4 eq 1 was again found to well represent the measured nwi tension isotherms across the entire range of pfca solution concentrations employed k ni values for a 1 mg l pfca solution are presented in table 5 as shown in fig 7 pfca k ni values were observed to be roughly an order of magnitude lower than those determined for the awi for all pfca homologues used in this work these results are consistent with those previously reported by mukerjee and handa 1981 who similarly observed lower adsorption for sodium perfluorooctanoate from dilute aqueous solution at the hexane water interface than was observed at the awi this result is not altogether surprising when considering the perfluorocarbon tails of these anionic surfactants are at the same time hydrophobic and oleophobic kovalchuk et al 2014 at the awi theory holds that the perfluorocarbon tails of the amphiphile are to be oriented into the air phase to minimize the overall free energy of the system on the other hand the orientation of perfluorinated amphiphiles positioned at the nwi is not as clear solvency theory would suggest that the oleophobicity of the perfluorocarbon tails would limit if not negate their orientation into the hydrocarbon phase resulting in lower overall adsorption at the nwi this theory appears to be supported by the fact that while pfca k ni values here were found to be the essentially the same for both tce and kerosene which possess similar polarity and intermolecular hydrogen bonding potentials hansen 2007 batista et al 2015 k ni values calculated from the data of mukerjee and handa 1981 were about a factor of 4 larger for sodium pfoa and pfda at the hexane water interface i e 1 5 10 2 cm and 2 4 10 1 cm respectively n hexane is a non polar solvent with its solvency dependent solely on intermolecular dispersion forces therefore there appears to be a relationship between the degree of nwi adsorption and the solvation properties of the napl that warrants additional research note also that the log k ni c n function exhibits greater linearity compared to the awi function this suggests that potential electrostatic screening effects observed for pfca adsorption at the awi were not as impactful for nwi adsorption r f values representing nwi adsorption as a sole source of retention were calculated using eq 5 and the a ni s w relationship described in section 2 2 4 again the moisture condition limits for this analysis were s w 0 77 to 0 17 the assigned residual moisture condition for this hypothetical sand the results of this analysis are presented in fig 8 which provides a means of comparing awi and nwi retention under the same water unsaturated system conditions the combination of the lower k ni values and the lower a ni exposed to the convecting aqueous phase during water unsaturated flow would then result in considerably lower r f values for pfca transport calculated r f values were only appreciably 1 for c n 7 the napl saturation used to develop the a ni s w relationship used in this analysis fig 1b can be considered moderate for this system for entrapped napl ganglia an increase or decrease in napl saturation would be expected to affect r f values somewhat but not significantly in that the a ni s w relationship would not be expected to change significantly r f decreases with increasing s w in response to the corresponding decrease in a ni across the range of s w considered it is worth noting that the k ni values and r f evaluation presented are representative of clean solvents napl contamination beneath pfas impacted fire training areas for example would more likely consist of a mixture of co solvated napls e g waste tce containing dissolved aviation grease and or tce dissolved in aviation fuel therefore the results of nwi retention calculations presented here should be considered illustrative however the observed similarity in pfca k ni values for both tce and kerosene fig 7 does suggest that mixtures of these napls would not result in significant differences in individual pfca k ni values 3 3 recommendations for numerical simulation of awi adsorption as discussed above pfca retention within water unsaturated porous media depends on factors and conditions that may preclude the use of retardation factors in analytical models typically used for predicting transport rates thus numerical simulation may be necessary to accurately simulate transport for realistic field conditions implementing the relevant processes within a numerical model requires tracking interfacial adsorption γ c w spatially and temporally within a simulation domain as it relates to a ia which in turn is determined by the p c s w relationship the simulator must allow for initializing an ionic strength condition and account for changes in γ as ionic strength varies within the simulation domain the simulator would also need to appropriately distribute contaminant mass between the convecting aqueous phase and the awi in response to changes in aqueous phase concentration in addition to accounting for other relevant retention processes e g sorption to soils finally awi adsorption would need to be included in the results of any mass budgeting subroutine here we describe one possible approach to implement awi adsorption of pfcas and potentially other pfas related perfluoro surfactants within future or existing unsaturated flow and transport simulators this approach highlights and includes some simplifying relationships observed from the results of this work although facilitating numerical simulation of awi adsorption is the focus of this discussion exclusion of other relevant and significant transport mechanisms is not implied for example existing unsaturated flow and transport models e g hydrus already account for sorption processes under a variety of potential modes e g as linear non linear one site two site kinetic modes and additional pfas specific sorption models can be easily implemented however commercial versions of these existing numerical simulators do not include interfacial adsorption as a retention mechanism therefore the following describes methods to include awi adsorption as an additionally contributing retention mechanism nwi adsorption could be similarly implemented if the simulator includes napl as a non wetting reactive phase 3 3 1 concentration dependent pfca adsorption because the ls equation was observed to fit the measured surface tension data γ c w can be described by the langmuir adsorption isotherm as 8 γ c w γ max k l c w 1 k l c w where γ max is the maximum surface concentration i e at the amphiphile solubility limit and k l is the langmuir coefficient m3 mol the ls equation presented as eq 1 can also be written as 9 γ γ 0 rt γ max ln 1 k l c w where parameter b in eq 1 is rtγ max and a 1 k l as a result the ls equation parameters provided in table 2 can be used to parameterize eq 8 directly 3 3 2 ionic strength dependence to model dependence of γ on ionic strength relationships observed between the ls equation parameters can also be exploited to help simplify simulation for example as shown in table 2 the fit to the surface tension data resulted in a ls equation b parameter that remained essentially constant for an individual pfca across the range of ionic strength utilized in this work a condition that was also observed by gurkov et al 2005 therefore γ max for individual pfcas can be assumed to remain constant on the other hand as shown in fig 9 k l as 1 a exhibits a clear trend with increasing i that is similar to those shown for k ia in fig 4 k l i relationships can also be modeled using the following langmuir like expression 10 k l i k l 0 k l max b i n 1 b i n where k l 0 is the pfca langmuir coefficient for i 0 di water in this case k l max is the maximum value for the dataset and b and n are fitting parameters by implementing eq 10 directly into eq 8 the transport simulator would not necessarily need to include a geochemical simulator to account for changes in awi adsorption due to variabilities in pore water ionic strength 3 3 3 implementing p c s w a ia dependence existing unsaturated flow simulators generally require parameterization of the relationship between capillary pressure and water saturation function p c s w for the porous medium e g via van genuchten and or brooks corey models however to model awi retention the p c s w a ia relationship is required fortunately these simulators typically calculate p c and or s w at each mesh grid node and for each numerical time step therefore simple modifications to the code would be required to additionally calculate a ia spatially and temporally utilizing existing a ia s w relationships like that presented previously as eq 4 eq 4 requires many fitting parameters that are typically specific for a given porous media however costanza robinson et al 2008 developed an empirical a ia s w relationship that greatly simplifies a ia calculation as 11 a ia cm 1 sa 0 9112 s w 0 9031 where sa is the geometric surface area of the media i e sandy soils and sand calculated as 6 1 n d 50 eq 11 is based on a smooth spheres assumption and is therefore most appropriate for sands and sandy soils however ongoing research in this area will likely result in similar relationships for additional soil types 4 summary and conclusions air water and napl water interfacial tension isotherms were prepared to determine concentration dependent adsorption coefficients for 6 homologous linear perfluorocarboxylic acids pfca of environmental interest and for 5 synthetic groundwaters of varying ionic strength tce and kerosene as a surrogate for jet fuel were used as representative napls as both are commonly found as co contaminants at former military fire training areas where afffs the langmuir szyszkowski equation was used to fit the interfacial tension data and parameters needed to recreate these isotherms for all pfcas and ionic strength conditions for both air water and napl water systems are reported in this work the interfacial adsorption coefficients were subsequently used to demonstrate the significance of pfca retention within water unsaturated soils awi adsorption was observed to decrease as a function of aqueous concentration a trend consistent with the slope of the awi tension isotherms awi adsorption was also observed to increase with increasing ionic strength and with increasing pfca carbon number while log linear relationships between adsorption and amphiphile carbon number are convenient for predictive purposes we found that these relationships did not hold for the synthetic groundwaters used in this research and conclude that they could be less reliable for natural groundwaters where a mixture of divalent and monovalent ions typically exist in solution however a log linear relationship based on pfca carbon number were observed for the napl synthetic groundwater systems retardation factors for both awi and nwi adsorption of individual pfcas increased exponentially with increasing pfca carbon number retardation factors for nwi adsorption were altogether lower than those for the awi as a result of lower interfacial adsorption coefficients and lower nwi area exposed to the aqueous phase within the three phase air water napl system using previously published relationships between interfacial areas and soil moisture contents retardation factors for both awi and nwi adsorption are shown to increase with decreasing soil moisture or water saturation in response to a corresponding increase in interfacial area within the range of moisture contents employed in the calculations as an example retardation factors for nwi adsorption of pfoa are shown to increase from a value of 1 86 at a water saturation of 77 to 44 6 at a water saturation of 17 the assumed residual water saturation for this system within this range of moisture conditions calculated awi areas vary by a factor of 11 given the degree of variability in retardation factors anticipated for interfacial adsorption under unsaturated flow we argue that the traditional use of retardation factors to estimate rates of contaminant transport is less reliable compared to their use in water saturated flow conditions and that numerical methods are a better option for this purpose a framework approach to implementing awi adsorption into future or existing unsaturated flow and transport models is provided for this purpose it is important to note that the k ia values presented herein are for individual pfcas and that the k ia c w relationship for a particular pfca will likely vary when additional pfcas are present in solution and at the awi the authors are currently conducting additional research to evaluate pfca interfacial adsorption from solution mixtures however as observed by vectis et al 2008 for a mixture of pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos competitive adsorption processes favor the most surface active solute resulting in a surface tension isotherm for the mixture that closely follows that of the stronger surfactant as an individual solute therefore the mathematical relationships proposed herein for implementing awi adsorption within numerical simulators are anticipated to hold in the case of pfca mixtures as the continued applicability of the ls equation to define the tension concentration relationship can also be anticipated to hold acknowledgements this research was supported wholly or in part by the u s department of defense through the strategic environmental research and development program serdp grant number er18 1389 the authors wish to acknowledge dr andrea leeson serdp environmental restoration program

hydrochemical factors influencing interfacial adsorption are not yet fully elucidated herein air water and napl water interfacial tension isotherms were prepared for six homologous pfcas of environmental significance for deionized water and five synthetic groundwaters of increasing ionic strength the isotherms were successfully modeled by the langmuir szyskowski equation and parameters used to fit the measured data are provided concentration dependent interfacial adsorption coefficients and retardation factors are also provided for each pfca and ionic strength condition and are

adsorption napl water interfacial adsorption 1 introduction the extensive use of aqueous film forming foams afff for fuel fire suppression and releases during equipment testing and training activities since the 1960 s has resulted in widespread contamination of groundwater resources surface waters and soils by per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas at both military and civilian facilities e g moody and field 2000 moody et al 2003 filipovic et al 2015 anderson et al 2016 afff formulations are a complex mixture of chemicals that can include 1 4 w w pfas and is supplied as a solution concentrate that is typically diluted to a 3 6 v v for use in fire suppression when released at ground surface afff solutions can infiltrate into the shallow subsurface allowing pfas contamination to initially transport through a vadose zone where pfas can be retained before impacting groundwater in some locations the vadose zone extends just a few feet below ground surface however at release locations in the western and southwestern united states us the extent of the vadose zone can be significant e g hundreds of feet providing conditions for longer term retention of these chemicals in the vadose zone environment the potential for pfas in the vadose zone to serve as a long term source of groundwater contamination has been recently identified from field scale evaluations shin et al 2011 xiao et al 2015 weber et al 2017 anderson et al 2019 for example based on site data weber et al 2017 concluded that pfas contamination within the vadose zone beneath a former military fire training area continues to be a source of groundwater contamination some 18 years after training operations had ceased pfas are also components of many industrial waste and consumer products that can leach and transport within both water saturated and unsaturated portions of municipal and commercial landfills which can also serve as a long term source of groundwater contamination therefore it is important to understand and characterize the mechanisms of transport of pfas within the vadose zone environment to better assist risk based assessments and remedial action decision making pfas of interest in our research are the perfluoroalkyl acids pfaa and specific to this current work the perfluoroalkyl carboxylates pfcas which are anionic surface active agents i e surfactants these chemicals have been identified as both components of some current and legacy afff formulations and degradation products of precursory afff components moody and field 2000 houtz et al 2013 weber et al 2017 pfaa retardation during transport in the vadose zone can occur as a result of a combination of retention mechanisms including adsorption to soil surfaces as mineral adorption or association with bound organic phases higgins and luthy 2006 guelfo and higgins 2013 and adsorption to air water interfaces awis within the water unsaturated porous matrix brusseau 2018 lyu et al 2018 partitioning from the aqueous phase to the soil gas phase is not considered to be of significance for the pfcas as these compounds will be dissolved as anions under typical environmental ph conditions when in dilute solution goss 2008 vierke et al 2013 for afff source zones pfas partitioning to co disposed non aqueous phase liquids napl e g hydrocarbon fuels and or solvents and adsorption at napl interfaces have also been suggested as a potentially significant pfas retention mechanisms guelfo and higgins 2013 mckenzie et al 2016 while awi and napl water interfacial nwi adsorption has been considered in the recent environmental literature the significance of these retention mechanisms to the transport of pfas in real vadose zone environment remains ambiguous brusseau 2018 presented a comprehensive retention model for pfas that included the retention contributions of solid phase sorption awi nwi adsorption partitioning between the aqueous and gas phases and napl water partitioning this modeling approach and its component processes was developed and evaluated by many researchers during the 1990s and early 2000s to describe hydrocarbon and hydrocarbon based surfactant fate and transport e g brusseau 1992 brusseau et al 1997 kim et al 1997 silva 1997 kim et al 1998 costanza and brusseau 2000 kim et al 2001 silva et al 2002 and was recently modified by brusseau 2018 to describe pfas retention in porous media specific to awi adsorption brusseau 2018 demonstrated that this mechanism alone could account for up to 50 of the total retardation of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa for an assumed constant volumetric moisture content and awi area condition likewise lyu et al 2018 performed unsaturated column experiments to demonstrate that awi adsorption alone accounted for 50 75 of the total retardation of pfoa depending on the aqueous concentration of pfoa which in this case ranged between 0 01 and 1 mg l using awi adsorption coefficients k ia developed from surface tension isotherm data extracted from a figure originally presented by lunkenheimer et al 2015 for the c6 c11 pfca homologues sodium salts lyu et al 2018 go on to demonstrate that awi adsorption as a mechanism for retention is significant only for pfcas c8 however this result is somewhat misleading as the data used to develop the adsorption coefficients were for pfca solutions prepared in deionized water it is well known that solution ionic strength and ionic composition affects and often enhances the degree of adsorption of both ionized hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon surfactants at the awi downes et al 1995 kissa 2001 gurkov et al 2005 with respect to nwi adsorption the significance of this mechanism and its contribution to the overall retention of pfas in vadose zone and saturated zone is less certain while it has been shown that perfluorocarbon surfactants exhibit some affinity for hydrocarbon water surfaces mukerjee and handa 1981 little experimental data exists to properly evaluate nwi adsorption for specific napls associated with afff training areas e g trichloroethene tce and diesel aviation fuels further as a part of parameterizing their aforementioned model brusseau 2018 addressed nwi adsorption by assuming nwi adsorption coefficients k ni and k ia values were equivalent based on ancillary observations of adsorption coefficient equivalence for hydrocarbon surfactants using a constant nwi area a ni and the same soil moisture conditions assumed for the awi calculation this analysis indicated that nwi partitioning provided a 15 contribution to the total retardation of pfoa in this system however the assumption of equivalent nwi and awi adsorption coefficients is not entirely satisfying given that previous research has demonstrated that nwi adsorption of both hydrocarbon surfactants i e sodium dodecyl sulfate and pfca surfactants on non polar napl surfaces are less than that observed for adsorption at the awi mukerjee and handa 1981 gurkov et al 2005 although brusseau 2018 acknowledge the potential for disparity between k ia and k ni values for perfluorocarbon surfactants based on physicochemical property differences additional research is needed to rightly quantify nwi adsorption coefficients to support fate and transport calculations at pfas source areas in this present work we address the limitations existing within the current literature dataset relating to fluid fluid interfacial adsorption and its significance as a mechanism of retention within water unsaturated porous media aqueous surface tension isotherms were prepared for 6 homologous pfcas and 5 simulated groundwaters of varying ionic strength nwi tension isotherms were also prepared for tce and kerosene as napl phases with kerosene serving as a surrogate for aviation type fuels commonly used at afff training sites concentration dependent k ia and k ni values are presented and used to demonstrate the significance of awi and nwi adsorption as a source of retention and their impact on transport and storage of these contaminants in the vadose zone a discussion of the applicability of the retardation factor for estimating pfca transport in water unsaturated porous media is provided finally a possible framework for implementing interfacial adsorption in unsaturated flow and transport models is presented 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials except for kerosene all chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich co and used without further purification perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea 97 purity perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa 98 perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa 99 purity pfoa 96 purity perfluorononanoic acid pfna 97 purity and perfluorodecanoic acid pfda 95 purity were selected as representative linear pfcas the free acid form of these pfcas were selected to mirror that produced in situ by the degradation and or oxidation of precursor compounds deionized di water used in this work conformed to the american society for testing and materials astm type ii specification sodium bicarbonate nahco3 calcium sulfate caso4 2h2o magnesium sulfate mgso4 and potassium chloride kcl salts were used to prepare solutions of simulated groundwater sgw tce acs reagent grade and kerosene 1 k grade were used for nwi measurements 2 2 methods 2 2 1 solutions preparation sgw solutions were prepared from di water in batches representing five different ionic strengths as shown in table 1 the range of water quality parameters was selected to mimic a range of values typical of natural groundwaters u s environmental protection agency epa 2002 from these solutions individual pfca test solution stamdards were prepared within 100 ml high density polyethylene bottles the preparations slowly agitated for 48 h prior to use di water pfca standards were also similarly prepared nwi standards were prepared by adding 15 ml of napl and 15 ml of aqueous pfca solution into 60 ml clear glass jars tce pfca solution standards were prepared by first adding tce to the jar followed by pfca solution to the tce surface conversely the kerosene pfca standards were prepared by adding the aqueous pfca solutions to the test jars first followed by kerosene as the less dense phase the dual phase preparations were allowed to stabilize for a period of 48 h prior to use 2 2 2 aqueous surface tension measurements and awi adsorption coefficients surface tension measurements were made with a du nouy ring tensiometer fisher surface tensiomat model 21 fisher scientific using standard ring methods astm standard d1331 1989 the tensiometer was calibrated using manufacturer recommended methods measurements were repeated over the course of one hour until the measured tension deviated within 1 across three consecutive measurements measurements were made using solution standards prepared to characterize complete surface tension isotherms up to and including the monomer solubility limit as determined from surface tension measurement stabilization however given that the observed range of pfca concentration values observed at pfas impacted sites is much less than the solubility limit for these surfactants the range of tension values for pfca concentrations between 0 and 100 mg l are presented within this range of concentrations solution ph did not fall below a value of 6 in all cases the results of these measurements were used to construct isotherms of surface tension γ versus bulk aqueous concentration c w the following form of the langmuir szyszkowski ls equation was selected to fit the data as adamson and gast 1997 1 γ γ 0 b ln 1 c w a where γ 0 is the surface tension of water at the ionic strength of interest and a and b are fitting parameters eq 1 was fit to the data utilizing the microsoft excel solver function i e generalized reduced gradient method and minimizing the sum of the squared error between measured and predicted values the data fit was then used in all further analyses as it provided a data set of higher resolution for calculating interfacial parameters awi adsorption coefficients k ia units or cm3 cm2 or cm were calculated using the following form of the gibbs equation kim et al 1997 szymczyk and janczuk 2007 2 k ia γ c w 1 rt δγ δ c w t where γ is the surface concentration mole or mass per unit area r is the universal gas constant and t is the temperature of measurement this procedure involved calculating the incremental change in the slope of the fitted tension isotherm data i e δγ δc w across the range of solution concentrations of interest and applying eq 2 lyu et al 2018 have previously demonstrated by comparison with the results of transport experiments that measured surface tension isotherms can be used to predict awi adsorption coefficients and estimate retardation factors for awi adsorption in porous media with respect to the data fit it should be noted that this approach utilizes measured data at higher aqueous concentrations and the surface tension of water at zero pfca concentration to anchor the fit of the ls equation thereafter the approach relies on model interpolation to ultimately calculate interfacial adsorption parameters at concentrations below the limit of discernment in surface tension measurement i e 5 mg l for pfpea pfhxa and pfhpa 1 mg l for pfoa 0 1 mg l for pfna and pfda therefore it is assumed that the ls equation continues to appropriately describe surface tension reductions due to awi adsorption at lower concentrations consistent with those observed at field sites 2 2 3 nwi tension measurements nwi tension measurements were also performed using standard ring methods astm standard d1331 1989 and the same du nouy ring tensiometer referenced in section 2 2 2 briefly the measurement method consisted of positioning the du nouy ring within the pfca solution phase and in the case of kerosene slowly lifting the ring into the nwi and recording the measured tension required to rupture the interface similarly the tce pfca solution systems recorded the tension required to rupture the interface when a downward force is applied on the interface i e du nouy ring pushed into tce phase the ls equation eq 1 was again used to fit the measured data with γ 0 in the present case being the interfacial tension of the napl water system in the absence of pfca concentration dependent k ni values were again determined from the eq 1 fit to the measured data using eq 2 and the procedure described in section 2 2 2 2 2 4 evaluating awi retention in porous media the retardation factor r f describing the contribution of awi partitioning under water unsaturated flow in the vadose zone is as follows kim et al 1998 3 r f 1 k ia a ia θ w 1 k ia a ia s w n where a ia is the area of the awi within a given volume of water unsaturated soil cm2 cm3 or cm 1 θ w is the volumetric water content s w is the water saturation and n is the media porosity here r f 1 indicates pfca retention due to awi adsorption is absent or negligible for water unsaturated porous media previous research has shown a ia to continue to increase with decreasing s w until achieving a maximum value near the specific surface area of the solid at extremely low s w e g kakare and fort 1996 kim et al 1997 silva 1997 brusseau et al 1997 kim et al 1999 silva et al 2002 costanza robinson and brusseau 2002 peng and brusseau 2005 the following a ia s w relationship was used in this evaluation peng and brusseau 2005 4 a ia s 1 α s w a b c where s is the specific solid surface area and α b and c are fitting parameters which in this case s 5200 cm 1 α 19 78 b 1 1 c 104 and a 1 2 b parameters used by lyu et al 2018 were also directly used to calculate retardation factors i e a ia 73 cm 1 and s w 0 77 or θ w 0 23 in this work for comparative purposes a graphical representation of this a ia s w relationship for a model sand is provided as fig 1a a similar a ia s w function was implemented within the hydrus unsaturated flow and transport model for simulating environmental colloid interactions with the a ia during transient drainage and imbibition cycles bradford et al 2015 2 2 5 evaluating nwi adsorption and transport retardation the r f describing the contribution of nwi adsorption under water unsaturated flow in the vadose zone is as follows saripalli et al 1998 5 r f 1 k ni a ni θ w 1 k ni a ni s w n where k ni is the nwi adsorption coefficient cm and a ni is the area of the nwi in this evaluation napl contamination occurs as entrapped napl ganglia within the porous media as the non wetting fluid in a typical vadose zone environment only a small fraction of the total napl area will be exposed to the convecting aqueous phase than would be the case for the awi at the same soil moisture condition therefore the dependence of interfacial area on s w for the nwi will differ from that of the awi to facilitate this evaluation the following a ni s w relationship was derived from the main imbibition curve of the computed microtomography measurements for napl at residual saturation for the data presented by porter et al 2010 as 6 a ni d e s w f s w where d e and f are fitting parameters which in this case were d 10 4 e 1 5 and f 1 5 napl saturation was at residual or 10 as estimated based on reported properties of the sand a graphical representation of this dataset and the eq 6 fit to the data used in subsequent calculations is provided as fig 1b 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface tension and awi adsorption examples of the surface tension isotherms developed in this work are presented in fig 2 for the di water solutions and two sgw solutions representing the lowest and highest ionic strengths used in this work the solid lines in fig 2 are the modeled tension isotherms resulting from the fit to the measured data the results of data fitting including fitting parameters and goodness of fit statistics are presented as in table 2 eq 1 was found to well represent the measured surface tension isotherms across the range of pfca solution concentrations utilized to our knowledge k ia values for pfca contaminants in solutions representing natural groundwater geochemistry have not yet been reported complete pfca specific surface tension isotherms can be reproduced using the a and b parameters presented in table 2 and eq 1 the high concentration limit is where c w provides the minimum tension γ min and the low concentration limit being c w 0 k ia values can then be determined at a specific aqueous concentration of interest from the slope of the isotherm at that concentration and eq 2 these surface tension isotherms have value not only for the purposes of this presentation but also for environmental calculations involving estimating pfca mass associated with aqueous aerosols or potential removal efficiencies for remediation technologies that rely on awi adsorption to air bubbles to remove pfca mass from the aqueous phase the results presented in fig 2 exhibit some anticipated trends measured aqueous surface tensions were observed to decrease with increasing pfca solution concentration and with increasing number of cf2 groups comprising the monomer chain i e increasing pfca chain length or carbon number c n for these homologous chemicals the corresponding dependence of k ia on pfca concentration is also provided in fig 2 k ia values are shown to decrease with increasing pfca concentration this trend may initially seem counter intuitive when considering γ increases with increasing concentration however as k ia represents the equilibrium condition between the pfca adsorbed at the awi and that dissolved within the bulk aqueous phase at very low concentration small increases in c w result in larger increases in γ which by eq 2 provides a larger k ia awi adsorption was also observed to increase with increasing sgw ionic strength this result is generally attributed to a hydrophobic effect that combines a reduction in bulk aqueous solubility of the amphiphile and decreased electrostatic repulsion of the ionic portion of the amphiphile when positioned at the awi gurkov et al 2005 the effect of dissolved electrolytes on surface tension is well known for surfactants and is readily observed in fig 2 additional observations related to solution ionic strength and pfca interfacial adsorption will be addressed in greater detail in a subsequent section a summary of k ia values calculated from the surface tension isotherm data developed in this work is provided as table 3 for a 1 mg l pfca solution concentration the 1 mg l concentration was selected for comparison with previous work and generally represents the upper range of values observed at field sites for pfcas e g fire training areas at naval air station fallon nv and tyndall air force base fl moody and field 1999 while there is currently a limited published data set from which to compare these results lyu et al 2018 presented k ia values for pfoa prepared in 0 01 m nacl solution and di water 2 0 10 3 cm and 9 55 10 3 cm per the reported regression equation respectively that are very similar to those presented in table 3 where sgw 1 ionic strength was 0 006 m the regression equation presented by lyu et al 2018 i e logk ia 0 56c n 7 5 described the dependence of k ia on c n for a homologous series of pfca sodium salts solutions prepared in di water that were derived from data originally presented by lunkenheimer et al 2015 the results of this regression equation are presented in fig 3a along with the k ia c n relationships developed for the current dataset for the di water cases calculated k ia values present log linearly with increasing c n as shown the slope of the log k ia c n relationship for the di water solutions prepared in the current work deviates from that prepared by lyu et al 2018 we attribute this difference to counterion effects and the use of pfca sodium salts by lunkenheimer et al 2015 in contrast log k ia c n for the sgw solutions exhibit a positive deviation from a log linear trend that increases slightly with increasing c n between c n 5 and 9 beyond c n 9 the log k ia c n appears to plateau repeated solutions preparation and subsequent surface tension measurements indicate the reduced awi adsorption for pfda is real for all sgw solutions it is possible that impurities in the pfca reagents selected could have contributed to these results however given the linearity observed in the log k ia c n relationship for the di water cases the observed deviation from log linearity observed for the sgw solutions is more likely related to the presence of dissolved ions in solution and concomitant electrostatic effects at the awi while the exact mechanism responsible for this observed behavior is not entirely clear some explanation can be gleaned from a few relevant literature sources for example lunkenheimer et al 2015 using highly purified sodium pfca homologues observed a non linear increasing trend in the free energy of awi adsorption g 0 ads with increasing c n that may help to explain some of the non linearity in the sgw log k ia c n function these authors argued that the non linearity in the g 0 ads c n relationship was due to variability in the debye screening length of the electrostatic double layer established at the awi that allows an incrementally increasing adsorption with increasing pfca c n that is in excess of that due to amphiphilic nature of these molecules alone as shown in fig 3b this incrementally increasing adsorption phenomenon may be occurring for the sgw cases for comparison with the present work g 0 ads was calculated as lunkenheimer et al 2015 7 g 0 ads rt ln a l where a l is the surface activity determined as fitting parameter a in the eq 1 fits to the surface tension isotherms in the absence of a counterion electrolyte the g 0 ads c n relationship for the free acid pfcas presents as a linear function across the range of c n investigated however in the presence of available counterions a similar degree of upward curvature is observed in both datasets in fig 3b g 0 ads is enhanced for the sgw solutions in response to the elevated ionic strength of the sgw solutions additionally the lunkenheimer et al 2015 dataset presented in fig 3b combines the results for both even and odd numbered pfca amphiphile carbon numbers which were presented separately in their original manuscript these authors further demonstrated variability in the magnitude of pfca awi adsorption that is dependent on whether the pfca contains an even or odd number of carbons in the chain psillakis et al 2009 also observed differing degrees of awi adsorption for both the pfcas and perfluoro n alkyl sulfonates when c n was odd or even these results suggest that an additional cause of the non linearity observed in the sgw log k ia c n dataset may be related to inherent differences in surface activity between odd and even homologues that manifest more intensely when an excess of dissolved ions are present in solution irrespective of the actual mechanism s at work here the current results provide additional evidence that log linear k ia c n relationships may not be appropriate to predict awi adsorption in natural groundwaters that contain a mixture of divalent and monovalent ions in solution 3 1 1 effect of sgw ionic strength on awi adsorption the sgw solutions used in this work were selected to include the major ionic species found in natural waters and to cover a reasonably representative range of groundwater ionic strength within the limits of measurement awi adsorption was observed to increase with increasing ionic strength and is consistent with the hydrophobic effect described previously however the effects of amphiphile hydrophobicity appears to have a limit for the sgw solutions used in this work in that the rate of change of adsorption decreased markedly once a threshold ionic strength condition was achieved this threshold condition is best observed in fig 4 where the calculated k ia values are plotted against the ionic strength of the bulk aqueous solution for pfpea and pfhxa k ia values were found to be less sensitive to changes in ionic strength within the range of values investigated however for pfcas of higher c n a clear threshold ionic strength condition exists above which the rate of further increases in k ia is marginal gurkov et al 2005 observed a similar threshold stabilization for the aqueous surface adsorption of sodium dodecyl sulfate in nacl solutions when the concentration of nacl exceeded 0 01 m this result is significant in that it potentially simplifies modeling of the effect of ionic strength i on k ia for example given the results presented in fig 4 k ia i could be modeled directly using a langmuir like expression however as will be discussed in section 3 3 an alternative approach that utilizes relationships developed between the ls equation parameters is of more practical value further gurkov et al 2005 described an additional simplification that suggests normalization of the effect of i on interfacial adsorption parameters can be achieved by re evaluating the surface tension isotherms in terms of the mean ionic activity the solutions we are currently evaluating this approach for the sgw results presented herein 3 1 2 potential significance of awi retention for pfcas within vadose zone soils awi adsorption specific retardation factors calculated using eq 3 and the k ia values in table 3 are presented in fig 5a for di water and sgw 1 and sgw 5 solutions as a function of c n the analysis utilized the same soil moisture condition and corresponding a ia used by lyu et al 2018 the r f c n relationship developed from the regression equation presented by lyu et al 2018 is also provided for comparison for these pfcas and for all datasets presented in fig 5a awi retention is observed to be minimal for c n 6 awi retardation is considerably increased for the sgws relative to the di water cases due to the increased interfacial adsorption observed for these sgws this result is significant and highlights the importance of accounting for groundwater ionic strength when attempting to predict awi retention for the sgw cases r f values for the higher carbon number homologues are shown to range between 5 and 20 as was observed for the log k ia c n relationship the predicted sgw r f c n relationship deviates from its smoothly increasing function at c n 9 in response to the stabilization of surface tension observed for the pfda isotherms for all sgws similar surface tension stabilization effects were observed for measurements utilizing perfluorododecanoic acid c n 12 data not shown r f values presented in fig 5a were calculated for a single soil moisture condition and a pfca concentration of 1 mg l additionally the moisture content condition in this analysis is quite high i e θ w 0 23 or 77 of the total pore volume assuming a porosity of 0 3 for the sand therefore the results presented in fig 5a provides a limited assessment of the degree of awi retention possible to provide a more comprehensive evaluation k ia values determined for sgw 1 table 2 were used to estimate awi adsorption specific r f values for soil moisture conditions ranging from s w 0 77 to 0 17 the assigned residual moisture condition for this hypothetical sand the results presented in fig 5b demonstrate the range of r f values possible for these pfcas as a ia changes with changes in s w for a 1 mg l pfca solution concentration for example at s w 0 77 a condition potentially met when and while water infiltrates into a volume of vadose zone the r f for pfoa is 1 9 whereas r f increases by at most a factor of 24 at the residual moisture condition r f values estimated for the higher carbon number pfca homologues at residual moisture were determined to range between 407 and 723 given the results presented in fig 5b it is clear that these pfcas should experience a wide range of r f values within the vadose zone during a given infiltration event where imbibition and subsequent drainage processes would cause the a ia to vary considerably during the event furthermore during an infiltration event it is likely that the concentration of surfactant in the mobile phase i e convecting aqueous phase will vary resulting in variability in k ia values temporally and spatially the interplay between these variables complicates the typical use of r f values via eq 3 e g to directly predict the time of arrival of contaminant at a particular depth in soil for water unsaturated flow generally the application of a r f to characterize the transport of a surface active chemical under water unsaturated flow at field scale is an ill considered chromatography problem in which i the area of the reactive stationary phase in question i e the awi is not constant spatially or temporally under typical field conditions ii phase transfer is concentration dependent and non linear and iii flow of mobile phase is not constant but rather dynamic and intermittent this may explain why methods successfully utilizing surface active tracers to characterize a ia under water unsaturated flow conditions are typically performed at high and constant water saturation where variability in a ia is minimized and uniform flow can be maintained within the porous medium and where the surface active tracer is introduced at a step input to maintain constant tracer concentration numerical methods are likely better suited to resolve the complexity of variables that govern the transport of surface active contaminants under water unsaturated flow conditions 3 2 potential significance of nwi adsorption and retention napl water interfacial isotherms for each pfca prepared for tce and kerosene as napl phases are presented in fig 6 again complete nwi adsorption isotherms were prepared and eq 1 was used to fit the data nwi isotherms were prepared for a single sgw composition i e sgw 2 as a similar relative surface interfacial tension response to ionic strength was expected for both the awi and nwi the results of eq 1 fits to the measured data are provided in table 4 eq 1 was again found to well represent the measured nwi tension isotherms across the entire range of pfca solution concentrations employed k ni values for a 1 mg l pfca solution are presented in table 5 as shown in fig 7 pfca k ni values were observed to be roughly an order of magnitude lower than those determined for the awi for all pfca homologues used in this work these results are consistent with those previously reported by mukerjee and handa 1981 who similarly observed lower adsorption for sodium perfluorooctanoate from dilute aqueous solution at the hexane water interface than was observed at the awi this result is not altogether surprising when considering the perfluorocarbon tails of these anionic surfactants are at the same time hydrophobic and oleophobic kovalchuk et al 2014 at the awi theory holds that the perfluorocarbon tails of the amphiphile are to be oriented into the air phase to minimize the overall free energy of the system on the other hand the orientation of perfluorinated amphiphiles positioned at the nwi is not as clear solvency theory would suggest that the oleophobicity of the perfluorocarbon tails would limit if not negate their orientation into the hydrocarbon phase resulting in lower overall adsorption at the nwi this theory appears to be supported by the fact that while pfca k ni values here were found to be the essentially the same for both tce and kerosene which possess similar polarity and intermolecular hydrogen bonding potentials hansen 2007 batista et al 2015 k ni values calculated from the data of mukerjee and handa 1981 were about a factor of 4 larger for sodium pfoa and pfda at the hexane water interface i e 1 5 10 2 cm and 2 4 10 1 cm respectively n hexane is a non polar solvent with its solvency dependent solely on intermolecular dispersion forces therefore there appears to be a relationship between the degree of nwi adsorption and the solvation properties of the napl that warrants additional research note also that the log k ni c n function exhibits greater linearity compared to the awi function this suggests that potential electrostatic screening effects observed for pfca adsorption at the awi were not as impactful for nwi adsorption r f values representing nwi adsorption as a sole source of retention were calculated using eq 5 and the a ni s w relationship described in section 2 2 4 again the moisture condition limits for this analysis were s w 0 77 to 0 17 the assigned residual moisture condition for this hypothetical sand the results of this analysis are presented in fig 8 which provides a means of comparing awi and nwi retention under the same water unsaturated system conditions the combination of the lower k ni values and the lower a ni exposed to the convecting aqueous phase during water unsaturated flow would then result in considerably lower r f values for pfca transport calculated r f values were only appreciably 1 for c n 7 the napl saturation used to develop the a ni s w relationship used in this analysis fig 1b can be considered moderate for this system for entrapped napl ganglia an increase or decrease in napl saturation would be expected to affect r f values somewhat but not significantly in that the a ni s w relationship would not be expected to change significantly r f decreases with increasing s w in response to the corresponding decrease in a ni across the range of s w considered it is worth noting that the k ni values and r f evaluation presented are representative of clean solvents napl contamination beneath pfas impacted fire training areas for example would more likely consist of a mixture of co solvated napls e g waste tce containing dissolved aviation grease and or tce dissolved in aviation fuel therefore the results of nwi retention calculations presented here should be considered illustrative however the observed similarity in pfca k ni values for both tce and kerosene fig 7 does suggest that mixtures of these napls would not result in significant differences in individual pfca k ni values 3 3 recommendations for numerical simulation of awi adsorption as discussed above pfca retention within water unsaturated porous media depends on factors and conditions that may preclude the use of retardation factors in analytical models typically used for predicting transport rates thus numerical simulation may be necessary to accurately simulate transport for realistic field conditions implementing the relevant processes within a numerical model requires tracking interfacial adsorption γ c w spatially and temporally within a simulation domain as it relates to a ia which in turn is determined by the p c s w relationship the simulator must allow for initializing an ionic strength condition and account for changes in γ as ionic strength varies within the simulation domain the simulator would also need to appropriately distribute contaminant mass between the convecting aqueous phase and the awi in response to changes in aqueous phase concentration in addition to accounting for other relevant retention processes e g sorption to soils finally awi adsorption would need to be included in the results of any mass budgeting subroutine here we describe one possible approach to implement awi adsorption of pfcas and potentially other pfas related perfluoro surfactants within future or existing unsaturated flow and transport simulators this approach highlights and includes some simplifying relationships observed from the results of this work although facilitating numerical simulation of awi adsorption is the focus of this discussion exclusion of other relevant and significant transport mechanisms is not implied for example existing unsaturated flow and transport models e g hydrus already account for sorption processes under a variety of potential modes e g as linear non linear one site two site kinetic modes and additional pfas specific sorption models can be easily implemented however commercial versions of these existing numerical simulators do not include interfacial adsorption as a retention mechanism therefore the following describes methods to include awi adsorption as an additionally contributing retention mechanism nwi adsorption could be similarly implemented if the simulator includes napl as a non wetting reactive phase 3 3 1 concentration dependent pfca adsorption because the ls equation was observed to fit the measured surface tension data γ c w can be described by the langmuir adsorption isotherm as 8 γ c w γ max k l c w 1 k l c w where γ max is the maximum surface concentration i e at the amphiphile solubility limit and k l is the langmuir coefficient m3 mol the ls equation presented as eq 1 can also be written as 9 γ γ 0 rt γ max ln 1 k l c w where parameter b in eq 1 is rtγ max and a 1 k l as a result the ls equation parameters provided in table 2 can be used to parameterize eq 8 directly 3 3 2 ionic strength dependence to model dependence of γ on ionic strength relationships observed between the ls equation parameters can also be exploited to help simplify simulation for example as shown in table 2 the fit to the surface tension data resulted in a ls equation b parameter that remained essentially constant for an individual pfca across the range of ionic strength utilized in this work a condition that was also observed by gurkov et al 2005 therefore γ max for individual pfcas can be assumed to remain constant on the other hand as shown in fig 9 k l as 1 a exhibits a clear trend with increasing i that is similar to those shown for k ia in fig 4 k l i relationships can also be modeled using the following langmuir like expression 10 k l i k l 0 k l max b i n 1 b i n where k l 0 is the pfca langmuir coefficient for i 0 di water in this case k l max is the maximum value for the dataset and b and n are fitting parameters by implementing eq 10 directly into eq 8 the transport simulator would not necessarily need to include a geochemical simulator to account for changes in awi adsorption due to variabilities in pore water ionic strength 3 3 3 implementing p c s w a ia dependence existing unsaturated flow simulators generally require parameterization of the relationship between capillary pressure and water saturation function p c s w for the porous medium e g via van genuchten and or brooks corey models however to model awi retention the p c s w a ia relationship is required fortunately these simulators typically calculate p c and or s w at each mesh grid node and for each numerical time step therefore simple modifications to the code would be required to additionally calculate a ia spatially and temporally utilizing existing a ia s w relationships like that presented previously as eq 4 eq 4 requires many fitting parameters that are typically specific for a given porous media however costanza robinson et al 2008 developed an empirical a ia s w relationship that greatly simplifies a ia calculation as 11 a ia cm 1 sa 0 9112 s w 0 9031 where sa is the geometric surface area of the media i e sandy soils and sand calculated as 6 1 n d 50 eq 11 is based on a smooth spheres assumption and is therefore most appropriate for sands and sandy soils however ongoing research in this area will likely result in similar relationships for additional soil types 4 summary and conclusions air water and napl water interfacial tension isotherms were prepared to determine concentration dependent adsorption coefficients for 6 homologous linear perfluorocarboxylic acids pfca of environmental interest and for 5 synthetic groundwaters of varying ionic strength tce and kerosene as a surrogate for jet fuel were used as representative napls as both are commonly found as co contaminants at former military fire training areas where afffs the langmuir szyszkowski equation was used to fit the interfacial tension data and parameters needed to recreate these isotherms for all pfcas and ionic strength conditions for both air water and napl water systems are reported in this work the interfacial adsorption coefficients were subsequently used to demonstrate the significance of pfca retention within water unsaturated soils awi adsorption was observed to decrease as a function of aqueous concentration a trend consistent with the slope of the awi tension isotherms awi adsorption was also observed to increase with increasing ionic strength and with increasing pfca carbon number while log linear relationships between adsorption and amphiphile carbon number are convenient for predictive purposes we found that these relationships did not hold for the synthetic groundwaters used in this research and conclude that they could be less reliable for natural groundwaters where a mixture of divalent and monovalent ions typically exist in solution however a log linear relationship based on pfca carbon number were observed for the napl synthetic groundwater systems retardation factors for both awi and nwi adsorption of individual pfcas increased exponentially with increasing pfca carbon number retardation factors for nwi adsorption were altogether lower than those for the awi as a result of lower interfacial adsorption coefficients and lower nwi area exposed to the aqueous phase within the three phase air water napl system using previously published relationships between interfacial areas and soil moisture contents retardation factors for both awi and nwi adsorption are shown to increase with decreasing soil moisture or water saturation in response to a corresponding increase in interfacial area within the range of moisture contents employed in the calculations as an example retardation factors for nwi adsorption of pfoa are shown to increase from a value of 1 86 at a water saturation of 77 to 44 6 at a water saturation of 17 the assumed residual water saturation for this system within this range of moisture conditions calculated awi areas vary by a factor of 11 given the degree of variability in retardation factors anticipated for interfacial adsorption under unsaturated flow we argue that the traditional use of retardation factors to estimate rates of contaminant transport is less reliable compared to their use in water saturated flow conditions and that numerical methods are a better option for this purpose a framework approach to implementing awi adsorption into future or existing unsaturated flow and transport models is provided for this purpose it is important to note that the k ia values presented herein are for individual pfcas and that the k ia c w relationship for a particular pfca will likely vary when additional pfcas are present in solution and at the awi the authors are currently conducting additional research to evaluate pfca interfacial adsorption from solution mixtures however as observed by vectis et al 2008 for a mixture of pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos competitive adsorption processes favor the most surface active solute resulting in a surface tension isotherm for the mixture that closely follows that of the stronger surfactant as an individual solute therefore the mathematical relationships proposed herein for implementing awi adsorption within numerical simulators are anticipated to hold in the case of pfca mixtures as the continued applicability of the ls equation to define the tension concentration relationship can also be anticipated to hold acknowledgements this research was supported wholly or in part by the u s department of defense through the strategic environmental research and development program serdp grant number er18 1389 the authors wish to acknowledge dr andrea leeson serdp environmental restoration program

1592,contaminants that are highly soluble in groundwater are rapidly transported via fractures in mechanically resistant sedimentary rock aquifers hence a rigorous methodology is needed to estimate groundwater flow velocities in such fractured aquifers here we propose an approach using borehole hydraulic testing to compute flow velocities in an un faulted area of a fractured carbonate aquifer by applying the cubic law to a parallel plate model the cadeby formation yorkshire ne england a permian dolostone aquifer present beneath the university of leeds farm is the fractured aquifer selected for this hydraulic experiment the bedding plane fractures of this dolostone aquifer which are sub horizontal sub parallel and laterally persistent largely dominate the flow at shallow 40 mbgl depths these flowing bedding plane discontinuities are separated by a rock matrix which is relatively impermeable k well test k core plug 104 as is common in fractured carbonate aquifers in the workflow reported here the number of flowing fractures mainly bedding plane fractures intersecting three open monitoring wells are found from temperature fluid conductivity and acoustic optical televiewer logging following well installation average fracture hydraulic apertures for screened intervals are found from analysis of slug tests for the case study aquifer this workflow predicts hydraulic apertures ranging from 0 10 up to 0 54 mm however groundwater flow velocities range within two order of magnitude from 13 up to 242 m day notably fracture apertures and flow velocities rapidly reduce with increasing depth below the water table the upper 10 m shows relatively high values of hydraulic conductivity 0 30 2 85 m day and corresponding flow velocity 33 242 m day permeability development around the water table in carbonate aquifer types is common and arises where high pco2 recharge water from the soil zone causes calcite dolomite dissolution hence agricultural contaminants entering the aquifer with recharge water are laterally transported rapidly within this upper part computation of groundwater flow velocities allows determination of the reynolds number values of up 1 indicating the lower limit of the transition from laminar to turbulent flow are found at the studied site which is situated away from major fault traces hence turbulent flow is likely to arise in proximity to tectonic structures such as normal faults which localize flow and enhance karstification the occurrence of turbulent flow in correspondence of such tectonic structures should be

dolomitic aquifer and provides an opportunity to assess risk of contaminant transport in an area of the uk which is characterized by intense agricultural and farming activity in fact 80 of ne england

research describes the magnesian limestone group as a carbonate aquifer where flow is largely dominated by fractures cairney 1972 allen et al 1997 hence the site at the university of leeds farm is an

rocks derived from shallow water sedimentation at the margins of the zechstein basin aldrick 1978 lee 1993 in ne england the magnesian limestone aquifer attains a typical thickness of 120 m fig 1a d and is formally part of the zechstein group which is characterized by a succession of marine dolomite limestone evaporites mudstone and siltstone of exclusively permian age smith et al 1986 tucker 1991 the magnesian limestone group is formally divided into three different formations the cadeby edlington and brotherton formations fig 1b smith et al 1986 the cadeby and brotherton formations represent the mainly carbonate units they are separated by the marls mudstones and evaporites of the edlington formation the base of the cadeby formation is characterized by 5 m of marls which separate the aquifer from the sandstone mudstone and clays of the pennines coal measures group fig 1b c the brotherton formation passes upwards into the roxby formation which is entirely characterized by anhydrite and gypsum allen et al 1997 the cadeby formation is characterized with the exception of the basal 5 m of marls by thinly bedded dolostone showing ooids corals and bivalves tucker 1991 this formation which represents the focus of this study was deposited during the lower permian 272 251 ma in a shallow marine environment under sub tropical climatic conditions then secondary dolomitization occurred at early permian and middle triassic diagenetic stages peryt and scholle 1996 dolomitization fluids were supplied from the gypsum and evaporites of the overlying edlington formation smith et al 1986 the brotherton formation above represents the uppermost part of the magnesian limestone aquifer in yorkshire and is characterized by thinly bedded dolomitic limestone with ooids algae and bivalves the brotherton formation was also deposited in a shallow water environment under tropical conditions but it differs from the cadeby formation due to less intense

walker 2006 boddy 2018 such high angle joints have been previously mapped in the magnesian limestone aquifer in yorkshire kortas and younger 2013 these fractures arise from the cenozoic uplift of nw

of fertilizers in agriculture nitrate concentrations in groundwater rose from average values of 0 28 mg l to 75 mg l between 1948 and 2006 in the study area aldrick 1978 walker 2006 at the university of leeds farm fig 1a d the magnesian limestone aquifer is unconfined due to absence or presence of only 1 m thick quaternary cover gaunt et al 1970 aldrick 1978 the cadeby and brotherton formations represent aquifers separated by the edlington formation which is considered a leaky aquitard hydraulic connectivity between the two separate formations is either related to faulting or gypsum dissolution that has resulted in the collapse of strata in the edlington formation farrant and cooper 2008 the magnesian limestone group is typically highly mechanically resistant ucs of 48 75 mpa it has been used as a building stone in ne england since roman times lott and richardson 1997 lott 2013 in fact highmoor quarry near the study site is one of the few main sources of dimension stone of this lithology which is elsewhere typically heavy fractured in outcrop walker 2006 groundwater flow is directed towards the east driven by topography which is characterized by higher elevations in the adjacent area of coal measures strata outcropping to the west fig 1c the cadeby formation interquartile interval ranges for intergranular hydraulic conductivity and porosity are 2 9 10 4 to 0 9 10 3 m day and 8 5 to 18 7 respectively these ranges substantially overlap those of the brotherton formation which range from 4 0 10 4 to 1 5 10 3 m day and 9 9 to 19 0 for intergranular hydraulic conductivity and porosity respectively allen et al 1997 pumping test values from the uk magnesian limestone aquifer are reported by allen et al 1997 transmissivities range from 6 to 4300 m2 day with median of 299 m2 day these pumping tests highlight a lower transmissivity of the cadeby formation tmedian 163 m2 day n 16 with respect to the brotherton formation tmedian 420 m2 day n 15 this has been interpreted as resulting from the higher dolomitisation which characterizes the cadeby formation 54 caco3 46 mgco3 this reduces the rate of dissolution in correspondence of fractures by contrast the dolomitic limestone of the brotherton formation is more abundant in calcite 65 caco3 35 mgco3 hence more prone to dissolution and permeability development allen et al 1997 lott and cooper 2005 however the highest transmissivities in the magnesian limestone tmedian 2000 m2 day n 7 are associated with fault zones due to the high degree of fracturing allen et al 1997 cooper and lawley 2007 the transmissivities within fault blocks are generally lower but extremely variable depending on fracturing density and proximity to rivers allen et al 1997 flow occurs essentially in correspondence of fractures i e evidenced by the large difference between permeability from pumping and core plug tests k well test k core plug 104 allen et al 1997 scanline surveys which have been carried out in the quarries nearby the field site indicate development of fissures of a few centimetres aperture exclusively in correspondence of extensional faults walker 2006 water geochemistry in the cadeby formation in the area of durham fig 1a shows relatively high alkalinity 380 450 mg l and relatively high concentrations of sulphate and chloride from dissolution of halite and gypsum from the overlying edlington formation younger 1995 mayes et al 2005 3 experimental methods three wells bh1 bh2 bh3 were drilled in the lower part of the magnesian limestone aquifer which is represented by the cadeby formation ne england uk at the university of leeds farm fig 1a b the three wells 30 to 40 m depth are located within fault blocks avoiding known fault traces the layout design approximates an equilateral triangle configuration as illustrated in fig 1d the boreholes were drilled with diameters ranging from 0 23 and 0 28 m to install a maximum of three piezometer tubes each with a 0 08 m diameter with screen length ranging from 2 3 to 3 0 m see construction details in table 1 3 1 optical and acoustic televiewer logging optical and acoustic televiewer mount sopris alt ql40 mk5 logs were recorded in open boreholes prior to piezometer installation and the data were analysed by structure picking sensu williams and johnson 2004 of discontinuities this structure picking allowed sterographic plotting of discontinuities n 264 as well as the computation of mean vector statistics for each group of fractures using the stereonet 9 software package allimendinger et al 2012 discontinuities recorded in logs in the cadeby formation have been divided into four groups bedding plane fractures d1 stylolites d2 and se d3 and nw d4 dipping high angle joints 3 2 fluid temperature and conductivity logs fluid temperature and electrical conductivity logs have been recorded in the three open boreholes using a geovista mk2 multi parameter probe measurements of fluid temperature and electrical conductivity were undertaken under ambient conditions flow logging was realised prior to installation of piezometer tubes in order to define sections dominated by flowing fractures for location of screened intervals construction details in table 1 boreholes were logged both downwards and upwards but the downward fluid logs are presented here as these have better data quality 3 3 slug tests three slug tests have been performed in each of the screened intervals of bh1 bh2 and bh3 boreholes table 1 using 5 2 and 5 l as withdrawal volume following butler 1998 a solinst levelogger edge 3001 data logger was used to measure hydraulic head variations a preliminary slug test was carried out in each screened interval to estimate the return time of the initial displacement to 5 of rest water level based on this preliminary test time intervals between the slugs were fixed to 10 min for bh1 and bh2 however a longer period of 30 min was used for bh3 slug tests analyses in bh1 bh2 and bh3 have been realised using the aquiferwin32 software package horizontal hydraulic conductivity k h has been computed for each slug n 24 using the methods of bouwer and rice 1976 and kgs 1985 applicable to partially penetrating wells in unconfined aquifers 3 4 hydraulic head monitoring and determination of groundwater flow vector hydraulic gradient and direction of the groundwater flow have been estimated by hydraulic head monitoring in each piezometer from 1st october 2017 to 30th june 2018 using a sampling frequency of 1 h correcting for barometric pressure variations position and elevation of the top of the wells see table 1 were surveyed with a leica gps ts15 device for accurate determination of hydraulic gradient the accuracy of this gps device is 10 mm and 20 mm for lateral and vertical position respectively the water table was assumed as planar and the three point estimation method has been used for determination of the groundwater flow vector the arithmetic averages of the piezometers heads in each borehole were used as variations between piezometers within the same borehole i e differences in head are 0 5 mm hourly data of hydraulic gradient magnitude and azimuth of groundwater flow have been calculated with the 3pe spreadsheet beljin et al 2014 3 5 potential recharge potential recharge r is defined as the difference between total precipitation p and the potential evapotranspiration et 0 daily totals of rainfall p are available at the field site i e a rain gauge is installed at the national centre for atmospheric science ncas weather station see location of the station with respect to bh1 bh2 and bh3 wells in fig 1d air temperature is recorded every 30 min at this weather station this allowed computation of potential evapotranspiration et 0 using the hargreaves eq 1 1 et 0 0 0023 r a t m 17 8 tr where r a is extraterrestrial radiation t m is the daily mean air temperature computed as an average of the maximum and minimum air temperatures tr is the temperature range between minimum and maximum values extra terrestrial radiation r a is computed using hydrus 1d from the latitude and altitude of the field site 3 6 hydraulic aperture determination average fracture hydraulic aperture has been found in order to determine the average groundwater flow velocities in fractures intersecting each screened interval the hydraulic aperture b represents the aperture of a parallel walled fracture of equivalent permeability this hydraulic aperture is expressed by eq 2 based on the implementation of the cubic law assuming laminar flow romm 1966 2 b 12 v t s gn 3 where t s is the screened interval transmissivity g is the gravitational acceleration v the kinematic viscosity of water 1 307 10 6 m2 s based on the 9 5 fluid temperature at the three boreholes and n the number of flowing fractures intersecting the screened interval flow in fractures intersecting each screened interval is considered bed parallel and sub horizontal as around 90 of flowing fractures are bedding plane fractures with 4 dip see section 4 2 below screened interval transmissivity t s is the product of the hydraulic conductivity k h from slug tests and the piezometer screen length w eq 2 is commonly used for computation of the hydraulic aperture in both fractured carbonate and crystalline aquifers at depths 50 mbgl quinn et al 2011 ren et al 2018a 3 7 computation of groundwater fracture velocity and flow regime average horizontal flow velocity v in fractures intersecting each of the studied screened intervals can be computed using eq 3 which is derived from the cubic law assuming fractures as parallel plates snow 1965 romm 1966 qian et al 2011 3 v b 2 g 12 v i where b is the average hydraulic aperture g is the acceleration due to gravity v is the kinematic viscosity of water and i is the hydraulic gradient along the fracture direction here the average velocity v in fractures was computed for each screened interval after determination of the hydraulic aperture b using eq 2 from slug tests and the hydraulic gradient from the groundwater flow vector see section 3 4 after determination of flow velocity at each screened interval the reynolds re number was found using eq 4 to assess whether laminar or turbulent flow occurs under natural conditions ji et al 2008 ji and koh 2015 ren et al 2018a reynolds numbers 1 indicate laminar flow 1 10 transitional and 10 turbulent flow i e laboratory experiments with single fracture models indicate that non darcian flow is significant with re 1 10 witherspoon et al 1980 zimmerman et al

formation is thinly bedded i e the typical vertical spacing of bedding planes is 0 4 m in quarry faces high angle joints 50 80 form a non stratabound fracturing system i e they typically cross cut the bedding planes fig 2a the fracturing network in the three boreholes is representative of a similar non faulted area optical and acoustic televiewer logs do no show displacement of bedding planes or presence of cataclasites confirming the validity of previous geological surveys at the field site see fig 1d good quality optical and acoustic televiewer logs see fig 3 in the three studied wells allowed the structure picking of discontinuities which are represented by bedding plane fractures d1 stylolites d2 and sub vertical joints d3 d4 see fig 4 low values of amplitude and travel time in acoustic televiewer logs show where bedding plane fractures d1 and joints d3 d4 are open hence representing potential flow pathways figs 3a b d here optical and acoustic televiewer images show no large 1 5 mm karstic features in correspondence of bedding plane fractures and joints figs 3a b d stylolites d2 are typically sub horizontal like the bedding plane fractures fig 2a b despite this they can be recognized in outcrop and optical and acoustic televiewer logs due to their typical irregular shape figs 2b 3c park and schot 1968 rolland et al 2014 acoustic televiewer logs also show how stylolites are characterized by lack of travel time anomalies thus such discontinuities are substantially closed and likely unconducive for flow the optical and acoustic televiewer logs acquired from the three wells confirm that the characteristics of the cadeby formation observed in outcrop are also present in the subsurface the three vertical boreholes show a layered aquifer 92 of discontinuities are sub horizontal 30 as a consequence relatively high angle 50 80 fractures characterize only 8 of total discontinuities however note that moderate and high angle joints are under sampled in vertical boreholes the terzaghi 1965 correction has been applied in contouring to correct for bias due to the vertical orientation of the three studied boreholes discontinuities grouped in three different families d1 d2 d3 d4 are plotted as poles in fig 4a d1 represents bedding planes which gently dip towards east fig 4b mean vector dip azimuth 97 5 mean vector dip angle 1 5 vector

1984 stylolites show a higher and more irregular vertical spacing with respect to bedding plane fractures table 2 sub vertical joints recognized in the three boreholes have been divided into two different families d3 and d4 high angle 50 80 joints dip both towards se d3 mean vector dip azimuth 147 0 mean vector dip angle 58 2 vector magnitude 0 92 n 9 and nw d4 mean vector dip azimuth 329 0

d4 families respectively table 2 4 2 fluid logs fluid temperature and electrical conductivity have been logged under ambient conditions in all three wells bh1 bh2 bh3 figs 1d 5 and fig s1 fluid temperature ranges from 9 2 up to 10 0 the vertical profiles do not increase with depth showing lack of correlation with the geothermal gradient fluid electrical conductivity shows values up to 110 ms m fig s1 and fig 5 relatively high for potable waters these values arise from natural alkalinity from carbonate dissolution but also gypsum and halite dissolution in the overlying edlington formation ions flow into the underlying cadeby formation though normal faults which juxtapose the two geological formations in the field site area fig 1c aldrick 1978 mayes et al 2005 fluid temperature and

juxtapose the two geological formations in the field site area fig 1c aldrick 1978 mayes et al 2005 the three logged boreholes show several inflow horizons identified by changes in gradient in fluid temperature and electrical conductivity in correspondence with visible traces in the optical and acoustic logs figs 5 s1 the number of inflows identified are 5 7 and 6 for bh1 bh2 and bh3 boreholes respectively each inflow horizons is either characterized by single bedding plane fracture or by a cluster of 2 3 discontinuities which are vertically spaced 0 10 m the three logged boreholes show several inflow horizons identified by changes in gradient in fluid temperature and electrical conductivity in correspondence with visible traces in the optical and acoustic logs figs 5 s1 the number of inflows identified are 5 7 and 6 for bh1 bh2 and bh3 boreholes respectively each inflow horizons is either characterized by single bedding plane fracture or by a cluster of 2 3 discontinuities which are vertically spaced 0 10 m effective flowing fractures represent between 30 and 100 of the visible features on the optical and acoustic logs sections corresponding to each screened interval table 3 the principal flow pathways in the magnesian limestone aquifer are represented by the bedding plane fractures d1 such as those represented in fig 3 indeed sixteen of the eighteen inflows identified in the three boreholes bh1 and bh2 bh3 are characterized by bedding plane d1 discontinuities nearly all such inflow points are either represented by a single major bedding plane discontinuity fig 3b or a cluster of minor bedding plane fractures fig 3d another single inflow in bh2 corresponds with two high angle joints d4 one inflow occurring in bh3 corresponds with both a low angle bedding plane fracture d1 and a high angle joint d2 thus 90 of the total flowing fractures n 28 fig 3 are bedding plane fractures with 4 dip although high angle joints fig 3a do not represent the principal flowing structures in the aquifer of the cadeby formation our data indicate they are capable of flow hence establishing vertical hydraulic connections between bedding plane fractures no inflows are localised in correspondence of stylolites d2 to summarise flow in the cadeby formation is largely dominated by bedding plane fractures d1 sub vertical joints d3 d4 secondarily contribute and stylolites d2 seem to be non conductive 4 3 hydraulic conductivity horizontal hydraulic conductivity k h values from slug tests are summarized in table s1 and range from 0 07 to 2 85 m day showing medians of 0 49 and 0 57 m day computed using the bouwer and rice 1976 and kgs 1985 methodologies respectively comparison of hydraulic conductivities reported in table s1 indicates that values analysed with bouwer and rice 1976 are 2 to 23 lower than those obtained using the kgs 1985 1 1 note that a number of authors hyder and butler 1995 butler 1998 cheong et al 2008 state that assumption of isotropic conditions in the bouwer and rice method results in an underestimation of hydraulic conductivity of up to 40 in strongly anisotropic aquifers the latter method has been selected for computation of hydraulic aperture i e specifically developed for fractured anisotropic aquifers hyder and butler 1995 this fits our hydraulic characterization of the cadeby formation i e temperature and electrical conductivity logs show how sub horizontal bedding plane fractures largely dominate flow horizontal hydraulic conductivity k h values from slug tests are summarized in table s1 and range

how sub horizontal bedding plane fractures largely dominate flow hydraulic conductivity computed both using bouwer and rice 1976 and kgs 1985 techniques progressively decrease with depth moving from shallower to the deeper screened intervals in all three boreholes this hydraulic conductivity decrease has been plotted in fig 6 which reports the kgs 1985 values as arithmetic means of the tests in each screened interval these screened intervals bh1 p1 p2 bh2 p1 3 bh3 p1 3 show length ranging from 2 3 up to 3 0 m and are characterized by a similar number n 2 5 of sub horizontal bedding plane fractures d1 such sub horizontal discontinuities represent the principal flow pathways in the cadeby formation and are characterized by a relatively regular vertical spacing 0 38 m σ 0 57 m table 2 in the three boreholes the number of fractures that localize inflows does not decrease with depth table 3 hence the observed hydraulic conductivity decrease fig 6 cannot be related to vertical variation of fracturing density 4 4 hydraulic monitoring 4 4 1 hydraulic head fluctuation and potential recharge the hydraulic monitoring realised at the university of leeds farm shows a similar pattern of head variation in the three boreholes with head range of 2 5 4 0 m between low in december 2017 and high in april 2018 figs 7 s2 with almost identical results from loggers installed in piezometers in the same borehole max difference 5 mm suggesting good hydraulic connectivity between bedding fractures the hydraulic monitoring realised at the university of leeds farm shows a similar pattern of head variation in the three boreholes with head range of 2 5 4 0 m between low in december 2017 and high in april 2018 figs 7 s2 with almost identical results from loggers installed in piezometers in the same borehole max difference 5 mm suggesting good hydraulic connectivity between bedding fractures temporal changes in hydraulic head are consistent with the potential recharge estimated from the ncas weather station data i e a gentle fall in head which reaches the minimum at the end of december 2017 corresponds to a period of negative potential recharge r see fig 7a and b a time lag of three weeks is observed between potential recharge becoming mainly positive in early december and the minimum hydraulic head occurring at the end of that month positive potential recharge r from 26th december up to 5th april fig 7a arises from low values of potential evapotranspiration et 0 occurring during this period this matches a steep rise in hydraulic head during the winter spring period which is 2 5 and 4 m in bh2 and bh1 bh3 respectively fig 7b fig s2 the hydraulic head reached a maximum in the middle of april fig 7b the time lag between the switch in potential recharge towards negative values in early april and the peak hydraulic head is 10 days finally a drop of the water table characterizes the period of late april may and june when high values of potential evapotranspiration et 0 exceeds rainfall p in this period of the hydraulic year fig 7a b temporal changes in hydraulic head are consistent with the potential recharge estimated from the ncas weather station data i e a gentle

of the hydraulic year fig 7a b 4 4 2 groundwater flow vector hourly data of hydraulic gradient and azimuth found using the averages of hydraulic heads from the piezometers in each borehole see figs 7c d 8a b show that the hydraulic gradient ranges from 0 0210 to 0 0247 and the arithmetic mean is 0 0236 fig 8a i e relatively minor seasonal variation the azimuth varies by only 5 8 with a fisher mean of 68 4 fig 8b the hydraulic gradient is characterized by a very gentle rise during the months of october november and december fig 7c this plateau during the autumn produces a cluster of hourly data in the range 0 0240 0 0247 where 45 of hourly data are grouped the hydraulic gradient drops during the months of january february march and early april fig 7c corresponding with the rise in hydraulic head at the field site then it rises contemporaneously to decreasing hydraulic head in late april may and june fig 7b and fig s2 the hydraulic gradient is characterized by a very gentle rise during the months of october november and december fig 7c this plateau during the autumn produces a cluster of hourly data in the range 0 0240 0 0247 where 45 of hourly data are grouped the hydraulic gradient drops during the months of january february march and early april fig 7c corresponding with the rise in hydraulic head at the field site then it rises contemporaneously to decreasing hydraulic head in late april may and june fig 7b and fig s2 the direction of the groundwater flow vector is also characterized by minor seasonal variation fig 7d the azimuth of the vector rotates 5 8 eastwards during the steep rise in hydraulic head during the winter spring period and shows a bimodal distribution fig 8b with 48 and 23 of readings clustered between 66 5 67 5 and 71 0 72 2 respectively the 66 5 67 5 cluster is representative of the months of october november and december the 71 0 72 2 cluster is representative of end of april may and june which are characterized by both a gentle drop of the water table and a little eastward rotation of the groundwater flow vector fig 7b d this contrasts the hydrologic scenario of the winter spring months which are characterized by both a steep rise of the water table 3 m fig 7b and a sharp eastward rotation of the flow vector fig 7d 4 5 hydraulic aperture fracture flow velocities and regime average fracture hydraulic aperture b at each of the screened intervals is computed using eq 2 b ranges from 0 10 up to 0 43 mm table 4 with smaller values found for increasing depths such values are in the range of shallow 100 mbgl fractured aquifers for bedding plane discontinuities and joints 0 01 0 8 mm cappa et al 2008 quinn et al 2011 maldaner et al 2018 ren et al 2018a determination of hydraulic aperture allows computation of the average flow velocity within fractures using eq 3 based on the measured horizontal hydraulic gradients groundwater flow velocities computed using this approach range from 13 up to 242 m day fig 9 velocities rapidly decrease with increasing depth in all three boreholes as a consequence of the depth sensitivity of hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic aperture see fig 6 the first 10 m below the water table represents the part of the cadeby formation which is characterized by relatively high horizontal hydraulic conductivity fig 6 k h 0 30 2 85 m day and flow velocity fig 9 v 33 242 m day groundwater flow velocities in correspondence of fractures also vary over time due to variations of hydraulic gradient during the period of the groundwater recharge fig 9 indicated by the horizontal bars however this effect is only maximum 15 of the mean value whereas velocities differs by several times 10 in bh2 and 3 between the upper and lower screened intervals the reynolds re number found using eq 4 varies in proportion with flow velocities fig 10 from 0 01 up to 1 1 thus laminar flow occurs under natural conditions notably the reynold number in the bh1 p1 screened interval which is located only 2 m below the water table partially exceeds the lower limit of the field of laminar turbulence transition fig 10 4 6 insights for contaminant transport 4 6 1 controls on permeability distribution and flow velocities groundwater flow velocities and regime have been determined by applying a cubic law model to the permian cadeby formation of yorkshire ne england indeed this is a fracture flow aquifer kwell test kcore plug 104 with flow dominated by sub horizontal 4 bedding plane discontinuities with absence of large karstic features 1 5 mm as schematically represented in fig 11 inferred hydraulic fracture apertures and hence groundwater flow velocities in this dolostone aquifer of permian age show strong reduction with increasing depth below the water table similar reduction of aperture of discontinuities with depth has been observed in quarries in the jurassic dolostones of the venetian alps in northern italy and in the carboniferous limestones of the county claire in western ireland williams 1983 our findings for the cadeby formation of ne yorkshire are consistent with trends in transmissivity t 15 4300 m day n 23 from historical pumping tests in that t values do not show any correlation with well depths up to 50 m allen et al 1997 indicating that the permeability with the formation usually resides close to the water table such permeability distributions typically arise from dissolution of calcite and dolomite occurring in the shallowest part of aquifers immediately below the water table which strongly enhances permeability and fracture apertures allen et al 1997 göppert and goldscheider 2008 hartmann et al 2014 the driving force of carbonate dissolution in carbonate aquifers is represented by elevated pco2 recharge water percolating through the soil zone atkinson 1977 palmer 1991 this is an active process in the critical zone at the university of leeds farm site in fact research on soil geochemistry at this site has revealed that agriculture activities increase decomposition rates of soil organic matter som this leads to an increase in the release of carbon dioxide from the soil into the groundwater with consequence pco2 increase holden et al 2018 as a consequence the most hazardous part of the critical zone for contaminant dispersal in these aquifer types is the uppermost highly permeable 10 m below the water table as depicted in the conceptual model in fig 11 reynolds number is up to 1 in this highly permeable upper part of the critical zone thus reynolds number 1 are likely to occur in more extensively faulted areas where more pervasive flow and carbonate dissolution has occurred in fact outcrop observations in areas close to extensional fault traces show cavities 0 1 0 7 cm in size in the dolostone of the cadeby formation single borehole pumping tests show in this aquifer much higher transmissivities in correspondence of faults t 790 1680 m2 day n 7 rather than within the unfaulted blocks t 15 210 m2 day n 16 likely to be a consequence of enhanced carbonate dissolution in association with faults allen et al 1997 cooper and lawley 2007 at our field site the hydraulic gradient and hence groundwater velocity does not significantly vary during the hydraulic year figs 7c 8a 9 this likely arises from the boundary conditions of the aquifer system at the university of leeds farm site i e streams coming from the adjacent hills to the west partially recharge the aquifer maintaining a stable hydraulic gradient aldrick 1978 these findings indicate how at least under conditions of relatively minor seasonal hydraulic variation changes in groundwater flow velocities with depth are much stronger than seasonal fluctuations in such conditions steady state groundwater flow models might be adequate to compute solute contaminant transport 4 6 2 future research future research on fracture flow carbonate aquifer types is needed in several directions we envisage efforts on both characterization of hydraulic conductivity versus depth and flow and contaminant transport modelling hydraulic conductivity can be better constrained in open wells using flow logging day lewis et al 2011 sawdey and reeve 2012 flute liner profiling quinn et al 2015 ren et al 2018a and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr testing walsh et al 2013 ren et al 2018b all these techniques that have been recently developed for fractured aquifers at shallow depths allow permeability characterization along the entire well rather than specific intervals this research has also shown how the limit of the laminar turbulent transition field can be reached even in non faulted blocks of carbonate rocks in absence of karstic cavities thus flow regime is likely to change as we approach areas of more developed carbonate dissolution such as extensional faults which are characterized by high transmissivities or systems of cavities connected to springs as seen in several carbonate aquifers across the world galdenzi and menichetti 1995 raeisi and karami 1997 gallegos et al 2013 bauer et al 2016 groundwater flow models need to be developed that can be implemented in correspondence of such structures i e to include likely occurrence of turbulence and higher groundwater flow velocities hill et al 2010 saller et al 2013 5 conclusions contaminant transport occurs at relatively high velocity in the saturated parts of shallow fractured aquifers and this may be very important in areas of arable and livestock farming activity here we report an investigation of the critical zone of a fractured dolostone aquifer permian dolostone of the cadeby formation beneath the university of leeds farm yorkshire a combination of fluid logging slug tests and hydraulic head monitoring was used outputs from these techniques were applied to a parallel plate model to determine the spectrum of flow velocities and establish occurrence of laminar or turbulent flow fluid temperature and conductivity logs identified the bedding plane fractures as principal flow pathways which is a common hydraulic feature in fractured carbonate aquifers hydraulic testing e g slug tests allows determination of the hydraulic fracture aperture by applying the cubic law determination of hydraulic gradient from hydraulic head monitoring then allows the determination of the spectrum of groundwater velocities in time and space indeed this workflow was applied at shallow 40 mbgl depths in a non faulted part of the permian dolostone of the cadeby formation it produced fracture flow velocities ranging from 13 up to 242 m day depth variations of fracture flow velocities are found much more significant than seasonal variations the upper 10 m immediately below the water table were most highly hydraulically conductive k h 0 30 2 85 m day and characterized by elevated groundwater flow velocities v 33 242 m day due to the processes of fracture aperture enhancement by carbonate dissolution which are typical of fractured carbonates hence these 10 m represent the most hazardous part of the critical zone for contaminant transport as a consequence we envisage further efforts on characterization of permeability with depth in the critical zone of fractured carbonate aquifers another key finding is that within unfaulted blocks in absence of large karstic cavities the reynolds number may reach 1 thus turbulent flow is likely to arise as we approach tectonic structures e g normal faults which are characterized by enhanced carbonate dissolution and macro karstic features groundwater flow models must be developed that represent

1592,contaminants that are highly soluble in groundwater are rapidly transported via fractures in mechanically resistant sedimentary rock aquifers hence a rigorous methodology is needed to estimate groundwater flow velocities in such fractured aquifers here we propose an approach using borehole hydraulic testing to compute flow velocities in an un faulted area of a fractured carbonate aquifer by applying the cubic law to a parallel plate model the cadeby formation yorkshire ne england a permian dolostone aquifer present beneath the university of leeds farm is the fractured aquifer selected for this hydraulic experiment the bedding plane fractures of this dolostone aquifer which are sub horizontal sub parallel and laterally persistent largely dominate the flow at shallow 40 mbgl depths these flowing bedding plane discontinuities are separated by a rock matrix which is relatively impermeable k well test k core plug 104 as is common in fractured carbonate aquifers in the workflow reported here the number of flowing fractures mainly bedding plane fractures intersecting three open monitoring wells are found from temperature fluid conductivity and acoustic optical televiewer logging following well installation average fracture hydraulic apertures for screened intervals are found from analysis of slug tests for the case study aquifer this workflow predicts hydraulic apertures ranging from 0 10 up to 0 54 mm however groundwater flow velocities range within two order of magnitude from 13 up to 242 m day notably fracture apertures and flow velocities rapidly reduce with increasing depth below the water table the upper 10 m shows relatively high values of hydraulic conductivity 0 30 2 85 m day and corresponding flow velocity 33 242 m day permeability development around the water table in carbonate aquifer types is common and arises where high pco2 recharge water from the soil zone causes calcite dolomite dissolution hence agricultural contaminants entering the aquifer with recharge water are laterally transported rapidly within this upper part computation of groundwater flow velocities allows determination of the reynolds number values of up 1 indicating the lower limit of the transition from laminar to turbulent flow are found at the studied site which is situated away from major fault traces hence turbulent flow is likely to arise in proximity to tectonic structures such as normal faults which localize flow and enhance karstification the occurrence of turbulent flow in correspondence of such tectonic structures should be represented in regional groundwater flow simulations keywords carbonate fracture velocity depth reynolds number 1 introduction a range of contaminants reach the saturated part of fractured aquifers in areas of the world which are devoted to agriculture and farming activity including nitrate sulphate chloride and toxic organic compounds released by mineral fertilizers and pesticides which are highly soluble in groundwater foster 1976 thorbjarnarson and mackay 1997 danielopol et al 2003 meckenstock et al 2004 bloomfield et al 2006 rivett et al 2007 2008 fouillac et al 2007 guy et al 2009 lerner

and goss 2000 wakida and lerner 2005 rivett et al 2008 mellor and cey 2015 rapid solute transport of contaminants occurs within bedding plane fractures and joints rather than via the intergranular

platforms of cratonic areas as well as in more tectonically active sedimentary basins and mountain belts walker 1967 blatt et al 1972 doglioni 1994 hence contaminant dispersal in groundwater represents a common hazard worldwide due to the growing production of pollutants in areas of intense economic use of land berkowitz et al 1988 skaggs and kabala 1998 christensen et al 2000 thornton et

williams 1989 rigorous coupling of hydraulic monitoring hydraulic head and field tests televiewer and or fluid logs and hydraulic tests is required to determine parameters e g fracture hydraulic aperture and flow velocity which control solute transport velocities in their saturated zones a methodology for computation of groundwater velocities within fractures has been developed by several authors tsang et al 1990 mckay et al 1993 lo et al 2014 medici et al 2016 2018a maldaner et al 2018 ren et al 2018a initially optical and acoustic imaging and fluid logging or borehole dilution testing are used to determine the number of discontinuities that effectively flow next hydraulic tests on screened intervals are undertaken for computation of fracture permeability and hydraulic aperture using the cubic law at this stage of the workflow a large number of authors have derived fracture flow velocities for characterization of fractured igneous and sedimentary aquifers assuming a parallel plate model of fracture flow witherspoon et al 1980 ji et al 2008 quinn et al 2011 indeed application of the cubic law to a parallel plate model is considered reasonable in absence of karstic cavities for fractured aquifers with flow dominated by sub parallel discontinuities which are separated by an impermeable matrix witherspoon et al 1980 berkowitz 2002 this is the approach of our research for determination of groundwater flow velocities and flow regime laminar or turbulent as indicated by the reynolds number within the fault blocks of a fractured aquifer in our investigation groundwater flow velocities within fractures in a carbonate aquifer under natural conditions have been found using optical and acoustic televiewer fluid logging and slug tests with focus on variation with respect to depth and seasonality our research contrasts with the previous approaches to determine velocities and type of flow regime for groundwater under natural conditions cappa et al 2008 quinn et al 2011 maldaner et al 2018 indeed the focus is on the variation with both depth and time in a specific case of a non faulted area we selected a non faulted block at specific field site the university of leeds farm spen farm in ne england between the cities of leeds and york see fig 1a d to orient future research in terms of hydraulic testing and modelling strategies for fractured aquifers the university of leeds farm is an experimental site dedicated to the critical zone which is defined as the outer layer of earth s surface extending from the top of the vegetation cover down to the depth of fresh water circulation in the subsurface anderson et al 2008 research at this experimental site is focused on the migration of the impact of human activities specifically agriculture in this case on this outer layer which is of paramount importance for both human health and economic development banwart et al 2011 2012 in this paper we report a hydro geophysical characterization of the critical zone of the carbonate aquifer of the permian magnesian limestone in yorkshire ne england uk at the university of leeds farm this experimental farm site see fig 1a b is underlain by this dolomitic aquifer and provides an opportunity to assess risk of contaminant transport in an area of the uk which is characterized by intense agricultural and farming activity in fact 80 of ne england is arable and livestock farmland as a result the concentration of nitrates in groundwater has steady increased since 1940 due to introduction of nitrogen fertilizers forster et al 1982 previous research describes the magnesian limestone group as a carbonate aquifer where flow is largely dominated by fractures cairney 1972 allen et al 1997 hence the site at the university of leeds farm is an optimum laboratory to investigate fracture flow in an area where hazards from contaminant dispersal is relatively high foster and crease 1974 forster et al 1982 previous published studies on the hydraulic properties of the magnesian limestone aquifer in ne england have focused on core plug and pumping test analyses and hydro geochemistry cairney 1972 aldrick 1978 younger 1995 allen et al 1997 mayes et al 2005 more recently a steady state groundwater flow model was published for an area further north in county durham fig 1b neymeyer et al 2007 here we propose an investigation using a combination of experimental techniques including fracture analysis on optical and televiewer logs monitoring of the water table slug tests and temperature and electrical conductivity fluid logs new to this aquifer specific research objectives are as follows i estimate hydraulic conductivities and hence apertures of flowing discontinuities ii estimate groundwater velocities and reynolds number and their variation with depth and time and iii address future research needs for carbonate aquifer types 2 study area 2 1 geological setting the magnesian limestone aquifer is characterized by carbonate rocks derived from shallow water sedimentation at the margins of the zechstein basin aldrick 1978 lee 1993 in ne england the magnesian limestone aquifer attains a typical thickness of 120 m fig 1a d and is formally part of the zechstein group which is characterized by a succession of marine dolomite limestone evaporites mudstone and siltstone of exclusively permian age smith et al 1986 tucker 1991 the magnesian limestone group is formally divided into three different formations the cadeby edlington and brotherton formations fig 1b smith et al 1986 the cadeby and brotherton formations represent the mainly carbonate units they are separated by the marls mudstones and evaporites of the edlington formation the base of the cadeby formation is characterized by 5 m of marls which separate the aquifer from the sandstone mudstone and clays of the pennines coal measures group fig 1b c the brotherton formation passes upwards into the roxby formation which is entirely characterized by anhydrite and gypsum allen et al 1997 the cadeby formation is characterized with the exception of the basal 5 m of marls by thinly bedded dolostone showing ooids corals and bivalves tucker 1991 this formation which represents the focus of this study was deposited during the lower permian 272 251 ma in a shallow marine environment under sub tropical climatic conditions then secondary dolomitization occurred at early permian and middle triassic diagenetic stages peryt and scholle 1996 dolomitization fluids were supplied from the gypsum and evaporites of the overlying edlington formation smith et al 1986 the brotherton formation above represents the uppermost part of the magnesian limestone aquifer in yorkshire and is characterized by thinly bedded dolomitic limestone with ooids algae and bivalves the brotherton formation was also deposited in a shallow water environment under tropical conditions but it differs from the cadeby formation due to less intense dolomitization peryt and scholle 1996 in ne england around the university of leeds farm fig 1b d the tectonic structures which characterize the uk magnesian limestone aquifer are represented by normal faults and non stratabound joints sensu hartmann et al 2007 outcrop studies and seismic lines carried out near the field site show how normal faults of mesozoic age are mainly oriented ene ssw fig 1b aitkenhead 2002 cooper and lawley 2007 medici et al 2015 the cenezoic alpine orogenesis results in the gentle dip 5 towards e of the permo mesozoic deposits in the yorkshire area fig 1b c bottrell et al 2006 hartmann et al 2007 bricker et al 2012 outcrop observations of the cadeby and botherton formations show how normal faults represent areas of high fracture density aldrick 1978 however non faulted sections in highmoor quarry at the university of leeds farm site fig 1d and elsewhere show high angle dip 50 80 joints of 1 2 m persistence cross cutting bedding parallel fractures fig 2 walker 2006 boddy 2018 such high angle joints have been previously mapped in the magnesian limestone aquifer in yorkshire kortas and younger 2013 these fractures arise from the cenozoic uplift of nw europe and are related to unloading due to removal of overlying strata odling et al 1999 kortas and younger 2013 other discontinuities that characterize the magnesian limestone include sub horizontal bedding plane fractures and stylolites bedding plane fractures in this aquifer are considered beds that have been reactivated by the cenozoic uplift kortas and younger 2013 however stylolites fig 2a b represent pressure solution structures that formed during burial diagenesis bedding plane fractures exceed the outcrop scale 20 m and are much more persistent than stylolites which in the cadeby formation show persistence ranging from 0 5 up to 1 5 m fig 2a walker 2006 gillham 2017 2 2 hydrogeological background the magnesian limestone aquifer represents the fifth and the third most important aquifer in terms of abstraction volume in the entire uk and ne england respectively cairney 1972 allen et al 1997 abesser and lewis 2015 contamination in this carbonate aquifer has arisen from the use of fertilizers in agriculture nitrate concentrations in groundwater rose from average values of 0 28 mg l to 75 mg l between 1948 and 2006 in the study area aldrick 1978 walker 2006 at the university of leeds farm fig 1a d the magnesian limestone aquifer is unconfined due to absence or presence of only 1 m thick quaternary cover gaunt et al 1970 aldrick 1978 the cadeby and brotherton formations represent aquifers separated by the edlington formation which is considered a leaky aquitard hydraulic connectivity between the two separate formations is either related to faulting or gypsum dissolution that has resulted in the collapse of strata in the edlington formation farrant and cooper 2008 the magnesian limestone group is typically highly mechanically resistant ucs of 48 75 mpa it has been used as a building stone in ne england since roman times lott and richardson 1997 lott 2013 in fact highmoor quarry near the study site is one of the few main sources of dimension stone of this lithology which is elsewhere typically heavy fractured in outcrop walker 2006 groundwater flow is directed towards the east driven by topography which is characterized by higher elevations in the adjacent area of coal measures strata outcropping to the west fig 1c the cadeby formation interquartile interval ranges for intergranular hydraulic conductivity and porosity are 2 9 10 4 to 0 9 10 3 m day and 8 5 to 18 7 respectively these ranges substantially overlap those of the brotherton formation which range from 4 0 10 4 to 1 5 10 3 m day and 9 9 to 19 0 for intergranular hydraulic conductivity and porosity respectively allen et al 1997 pumping test values from the uk magnesian limestone aquifer are reported by allen et al 1997 transmissivities range from 6 to 4300 m2 day with median of 299 m2 day these pumping tests highlight a lower transmissivity of the cadeby formation tmedian 163 m2 day n 16 with respect to the brotherton formation tmedian 420 m2 day n 15 this has been interpreted as resulting from the higher dolomitisation which characterizes the cadeby formation 54 caco3 46 mgco3 this reduces the rate of dissolution in correspondence of fractures by contrast the dolomitic limestone of the brotherton formation is more abundant in calcite 65 caco3 35 mgco3 hence more prone to dissolution and permeability development allen et al 1997 lott and cooper 2005 however the highest transmissivities in the magnesian limestone tmedian 2000 m2 day n 7 are associated with fault zones due to the high degree of fracturing allen et al 1997 cooper and lawley 2007 the transmissivities within fault blocks are generally lower but extremely variable depending on fracturing density and proximity to rivers allen et al 1997 flow occurs essentially in correspondence of fractures i e evidenced by the large difference between permeability from pumping and core plug tests k well test k core plug 104 allen et al 1997 scanline surveys which have been carried out in the quarries nearby the field site indicate development of fissures of a few centimetres aperture exclusively in correspondence of extensional faults walker 2006 water geochemistry in the cadeby formation in the area of durham fig 1a shows relatively high alkalinity 380 450 mg l and relatively high concentrations of sulphate and chloride from dissolution of halite and gypsum from the overlying edlington formation younger 1995 mayes et al 2005 3 experimental methods three wells bh1 bh2 bh3 were drilled in the lower part of the magnesian limestone aquifer which is represented by the cadeby formation ne england uk at the university of leeds farm fig 1a b the three wells 30 to 40 m depth are located within fault blocks avoiding known fault traces the layout design approximates an equilateral triangle configuration as illustrated in fig 1d the boreholes were drilled with diameters ranging from 0 23 and 0 28 m to install a maximum of three piezometer tubes each with a 0 08 m diameter with screen length ranging from 2 3 to 3 0 m see construction details in table 1 3 1 optical and acoustic televiewer logging optical and acoustic televiewer mount sopris alt ql40 mk5 logs were recorded in open boreholes prior to piezometer installation and the data were analysed by structure picking sensu williams and johnson 2004 of discontinuities this structure picking allowed sterographic plotting of discontinuities n 264 as well as the computation of mean vector statistics for each group of fractures using the stereonet 9 software package allimendinger et al 2012 discontinuities recorded in logs in the cadeby formation have been divided into four groups bedding plane fractures d1 stylolites d2 and se d3 and nw d4 dipping high angle joints 3 2 fluid temperature and conductivity logs fluid temperature and electrical conductivity logs have been recorded in the three open boreholes using a geovista mk2 multi parameter probe measurements of fluid temperature and electrical conductivity were undertaken under ambient conditions flow logging was realised prior to installation of piezometer tubes in order to define sections dominated by flowing fractures for location of screened intervals construction details in table 1 boreholes were logged both downwards and upwards but the downward fluid logs are presented here as these have better data quality 3 3 slug tests three slug tests have been performed in each of the screened intervals of bh1 bh2 and bh3 boreholes table 1 using 5 2 and 5 l as withdrawal volume following butler 1998 a solinst levelogger edge 3001 data logger was used to measure hydraulic head variations a preliminary slug test was carried out in each screened interval to estimate the return time of the initial displacement to 5 of rest water level based on this preliminary test time intervals between the slugs were fixed to 10 min for bh1 and bh2 however a longer period of 30 min was used for bh3 slug tests analyses in bh1 bh2 and bh3 have been realised using the aquiferwin32 software package horizontal hydraulic conductivity k h has been computed for each slug n 24 using the methods of bouwer and rice 1976 and kgs 1985 applicable to partially penetrating wells in unconfined aquifers 3 4 hydraulic head monitoring and determination of groundwater flow vector hydraulic gradient and direction of the groundwater flow have been estimated by hydraulic head monitoring in each piezometer from 1st october 2017 to 30th june 2018 using a sampling frequency of 1 h correcting for barometric pressure variations position and elevation of the top of the wells see table 1 were surveyed with a leica gps ts15 device for accurate determination of hydraulic gradient the accuracy of this gps device is 10 mm and 20 mm for lateral and vertical position respectively the water table was assumed as planar and the three point estimation method has been used for determination of the groundwater flow vector the arithmetic averages of the piezometers heads in each borehole were used as variations between piezometers within the same borehole i e differences in head are 0 5 mm hourly data of hydraulic gradient magnitude and azimuth of groundwater flow have been calculated with the 3pe spreadsheet beljin et al 2014 3 5 potential recharge potential recharge r is defined as the difference between total precipitation p and the potential evapotranspiration et 0 daily totals of rainfall p are available at the field site i e a rain gauge is installed at the national centre for atmospheric science ncas weather station see location of the station with respect to bh1 bh2 and bh3 wells in fig 1d air temperature is recorded every 30 min at this weather station this allowed computation of potential evapotranspiration et 0 using the hargreaves eq 1 1 et 0 0 0023 r a t m 17 8 tr where r a is extraterrestrial radiation t m is the daily mean air temperature computed as an average of the maximum and minimum air temperatures tr is the temperature range between minimum and maximum values extra terrestrial radiation r a is computed using hydrus 1d from the latitude and altitude of the field site 3 6 hydraulic aperture determination average fracture hydraulic aperture has been found in order to determine the average groundwater flow velocities in fractures intersecting each screened interval the hydraulic aperture b represents the aperture of a parallel walled fracture of equivalent permeability this hydraulic aperture is expressed by eq 2 based on the implementation of the cubic law assuming laminar flow romm 1966 2 b 12 v t s gn 3 where t s is the screened interval transmissivity g is the gravitational acceleration v the kinematic viscosity of water 1 307 10 6 m2 s based on the 9 5 fluid temperature at the three boreholes and n the number of flowing fractures intersecting the screened interval flow in fractures intersecting each screened interval is considered bed parallel and sub horizontal as around 90 of flowing fractures are bedding plane fractures with 4 dip see section 4 2 below screened interval transmissivity t s is the product of the hydraulic conductivity k h from slug tests and the piezometer screen length w eq 2 is commonly used for computation of the hydraulic aperture in both fractured carbonate and crystalline aquifers at depths 50 mbgl quinn et al 2011 ren et al 2018a 3 7 computation of groundwater fracture velocity and flow regime average horizontal flow velocity v in fractures intersecting each of the studied screened intervals can be computed using eq 3 which is derived from the cubic law assuming fractures as parallel plates snow 1965 romm 1966 qian et al 2011 3 v b 2 g 12 v i where b is the average hydraulic aperture g is the acceleration due to gravity v is the kinematic viscosity of water and i is the hydraulic gradient along the fracture direction here the average velocity v in fractures was computed for each screened interval after determination of the hydraulic aperture b using eq 2 from slug tests and the hydraulic gradient from the groundwater flow vector see section 3 4 after determination of flow velocity at each screened interval the reynolds re number was found using eq 4 to assess whether laminar or turbulent flow occurs under natural conditions ji et al 2008 ji and koh 2015 ren et al 2018a reynolds numbers 1 indicate laminar flow 1 10 transitional and 10 turbulent flow i e laboratory experiments with single fracture models indicate that non darcian flow is significant with re 1 10 witherspoon et al 1980 zimmerman et al 2004 ranjith and darlington 2007 ji et al 2008 4 re v b v 4 results and discussion 4 1 aquifer fractures outcrop observations at highmoor quarry see fig 2 show how the dolomite aquifer of the cadeby formation is thinly bedded i e the typical vertical spacing of bedding planes is 0 4 m in quarry faces high angle joints 50 80 form a non stratabound fracturing system i e they typically cross cut the bedding planes fig 2a the fracturing network in the three boreholes is representative of a similar non faulted area optical and acoustic televiewer logs do no show displacement of bedding planes or presence of cataclasites confirming the validity of previous geological surveys at the field site see fig 1d good quality optical and acoustic televiewer logs see fig 3 in the three studied wells allowed the structure picking of discontinuities which are represented by bedding plane fractures d1 stylolites d2 and sub vertical joints d3 d4 see fig 4 low values of amplitude and travel time in acoustic televiewer logs show where bedding plane fractures d1 and joints d3 d4 are open hence representing potential flow pathways figs 3a b d here optical and acoustic televiewer images show no large 1 5 mm karstic features in correspondence of bedding plane fractures and joints figs 3a b d stylolites d2 are typically sub horizontal like the bedding plane fractures fig 2a b despite this they can be recognized in outcrop and optical and acoustic televiewer logs due to their typical irregular shape figs 2b 3c park and schot 1968 rolland et al 2014 acoustic televiewer logs also show how stylolites are characterized by lack of travel time anomalies thus such discontinuities are substantially closed and likely unconducive for flow the optical and acoustic televiewer logs acquired from the three wells confirm that the characteristics of the cadeby formation observed in outcrop are also present in the subsurface the three vertical boreholes show a layered aquifer 92 of discontinuities are sub horizontal 30 as a consequence relatively high angle 50 80 fractures characterize only 8 of total discontinuities however note that moderate and high angle joints are under sampled in vertical boreholes the terzaghi 1965 correction has been applied in contouring to correct for bias due to the vertical orientation of the three studied boreholes discontinuities grouped in three different families d1 d2 d3 d4 are plotted as poles in fig 4a d1 represents bedding planes which gently dip towards east fig 4b mean vector dip azimuth 97 5 mean vector dip angle 1 5 vector

1984 stylolites show a higher and more irregular vertical spacing with respect to bedding plane fractures table 2 sub vertical joints recognized in the three boreholes have been divided into two different families d3 and d4 high angle 50 80 joints dip both towards se d3 mean vector dip azimuth 147 0 mean vector dip angle 58 2 vector magnitude 0 92 n 9 and nw d4 mean vector dip azimuth 329 0 mean vector dip angle 56 8 vector magnitude 0 87 n 8 as illustrated in the stereonet plots in fig 4 such high angle joints fig 3a occur in boreholes with a vertical spacing of 7 0 and 8 5 m for d3 and d4 families respectively table 2 4 2 fluid logs fluid temperature and electrical conductivity have been logged under ambient conditions in all three wells bh1 bh2 bh3 figs 1d 5 and fig s1 fluid temperature ranges from 9 2 up to 10 0 the vertical profiles do not increase with depth showing lack of correlation with the geothermal gradient fluid electrical conductivity shows values up to 110 ms m fig s1 and fig 5 relatively high for potable waters these values arise from natural alkalinity from carbonate dissolution but also gypsum and halite dissolution in the overlying edlington formation ions flow into the underlying cadeby formation though normal faults which juxtapose the two geological formations in the field site area fig 1c aldrick 1978 mayes et al 2005 fluid temperature and electrical conductivity have been logged under ambient conditions in all three wells bh1 bh2 bh3 figs 1d 5 and fig s1 fluid temperature ranges from 9 2 up to 10 0 the vertical profiles do not increase

juxtapose the two geological formations in the field site area fig 1c aldrick 1978 mayes et al 2005 the three logged boreholes show several inflow horizons identified by changes in gradient in fluid temperature and electrical conductivity in correspondence with visible traces in the optical and acoustic logs figs 5 s1 the number of inflows identified are 5 7 and 6 for bh1 bh2 and bh3 boreholes respectively each inflow horizons is either characterized by single bedding plane fracture or by a cluster of 2 3 discontinuities which are vertically spaced 0 10 m the three logged boreholes show several inflow horizons identified by changes in gradient in fluid temperature and electrical conductivity in correspondence with visible traces in the optical and acoustic logs figs 5 s1 the number of inflows identified are 5 7 and 6 for bh1 bh2 and bh3 boreholes respectively each inflow horizons is either characterized by single bedding plane fracture or by a cluster of 2 3 discontinuities which are vertically spaced 0 10 m effective flowing fractures represent between 30 and 100 of the visible features on the optical and acoustic logs sections corresponding to each screened interval table 3 the principal flow pathways in the magnesian limestone aquifer are represented by the bedding plane fractures d1 such as those represented in fig 3 indeed sixteen of the eighteen inflows identified in the three boreholes bh1 and bh2 bh3 are characterized by bedding plane d1 discontinuities nearly all such inflow points are either represented by a single major bedding plane discontinuity fig 3b or a cluster of minor bedding plane fractures fig 3d another single inflow in bh2 corresponds with two high angle joints d4 one inflow occurring in bh3 corresponds with both a low angle bedding plane fracture d1 and a high angle joint d2 thus 90 of the total flowing fractures n 28 fig 3 are bedding plane fractures with 4 dip although high angle joints fig 3a do not represent the principal flowing structures in the aquifer of the cadeby formation our data indicate they are capable of flow hence establishing vertical hydraulic connections between bedding plane fractures no inflows are localised in correspondence of stylolites d2 to summarise flow in the cadeby formation is largely dominated by bedding plane fractures d1 sub vertical joints d3 d4 secondarily contribute and stylolites d2 seem to be non conductive 4 3 hydraulic conductivity horizontal hydraulic conductivity k h values from slug tests are summarized in table s1 and range from 0 07 to 2 85 m day showing medians of 0 49 and 0 57 m day computed using the bouwer and rice 1976 and kgs 1985 methodologies respectively comparison of hydraulic conductivities reported in table s1 indicates that values analysed with bouwer and rice 1976 are 2 to 23 lower than those obtained using the kgs 1985 1 1 note that a number of authors hyder and butler 1995 butler 1998 cheong et al 2008 state that assumption of isotropic conditions in the bouwer and rice method results in an underestimation of hydraulic conductivity of up to 40 in strongly anisotropic aquifers the latter method has been selected for computation of hydraulic aperture i e specifically developed for fractured anisotropic aquifers hyder and butler 1995 this fits our hydraulic characterization of the cadeby formation i e temperature

how sub horizontal bedding plane fractures largely dominate flow hydraulic conductivity computed both using bouwer and rice 1976 and kgs 1985 techniques progressively decrease with depth moving from shallower to the deeper screened intervals in all three boreholes this hydraulic conductivity decrease has been plotted in fig 6 which reports the kgs 1985 values as arithmetic means of the tests in

of the hydraulic year fig 7a b 4 4 2 groundwater flow vector hourly data of hydraulic gradient and azimuth found using the averages of hydraulic heads from the piezometers in each borehole see figs 7c d 8a b show that the hydraulic gradient ranges from 0 0210 to 0 0247 and the arithmetic mean is 0 0236 fig 8a i e relatively minor seasonal variation the azimuth varies by only 5 8 with a fisher mean of 68 4 fig 8b the hydraulic gradient is characterized by a very gentle rise during the months of october november and december fig 7c this plateau during the autumn produces a cluster of hourly data in the range 0 0240 0 0247 where 45 of hourly data are grouped the hydraulic gradient drops during the months of january february march and early april fig 7c corresponding with the rise in hydraulic head at the field site then it rises contemporaneously to decreasing hydraulic head in late april may and june fig 7b and fig s2 the hydraulic gradient is characterized by a very gentle rise during

respectively the 66 5 67 5 cluster is representative of the months of october november and december the 71 0 72 2 cluster is representative of end of april may and june which are characterized by both a gentle drop of the water table and a little eastward rotation of the groundwater flow vector fig 7b d this contrasts the hydrologic scenario of the winter spring months which are characterized by both a steep rise of the water table 3 m fig 7b and a sharp eastward rotation of the flow vector fig 7d 4 5 hydraulic aperture fracture flow velocities and regime average fracture hydraulic aperture b at each of the screened intervals is computed using eq 2 b ranges from 0 10 up to 0 43 mm table 4 with smaller values found for increasing depths such values are in the range of shallow 100 mbgl fractured aquifers for bedding plane discontinuities and joints 0 01 0 8 mm cappa et al 2008 quinn et al 2011 maldaner et al 2018 ren et al 2018a determination of hydraulic aperture allows computation of the average flow velocity within fractures using eq 3 based on the measured horizontal hydraulic gradients groundwater flow velocities computed using this approach range from 13 up to 242 m day fig 9 velocities rapidly decrease with increasing depth in all three boreholes as a consequence of the depth sensitivity of hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic aperture see fig 6 the first 10 m below the water table represents the part of the cadeby formation which is characterized by relatively high horizontal hydraulic conductivity fig 6 k h 0 30 2 85 m day and flow velocity fig 9 v 33 242 m day groundwater flow velocities in correspondence of fractures also vary over time due to variations of hydraulic gradient during the period of the groundwater recharge fig 9 indicated by the horizontal bars however this effect is only maximum 15 of the mean value whereas velocities differs by several times 10 in bh2 and 3 between the upper and lower screened intervals the reynolds re number found using eq 4 varies in proportion with flow velocities fig 10 from 0 01 up to 1 1 thus laminar flow occurs under natural conditions notably the reynold number in the bh1 p1 screened interval which is located only 2 m below the water table partially exceeds the lower limit of the field of laminar turbulence transition fig 10 4 6 insights for contaminant transport 4 6 1 controls on permeability distribution and flow velocities groundwater flow velocities and regime have been determined by applying a cubic law model to the permian cadeby formation of yorkshire ne england indeed this is a fracture flow aquifer kwell test kcore plug 104 with flow dominated by sub horizontal 4 bedding plane discontinuities with absence of large karstic features 1 5 mm as schematically represented in fig 11 inferred hydraulic fracture apertures and hence groundwater flow velocities in this dolostone aquifer of permian age show strong reduction with increasing depth below the water table similar reduction of aperture of discontinuities with depth has been observed in quarries in the jurassic dolostones of the venetian alps in northern italy and in the carboniferous limestones of the county claire in western ireland williams 1983 our findings for the cadeby formation of ne yorkshire are consistent with trends in transmissivity t 15 4300 m day n 23 from historical pumping tests in that t values do not show any correlation with well depths up to 50 m allen et al 1997 indicating that the permeability with the formation usually resides close to the water table such permeability distributions typically arise from dissolution of calcite and dolomite occurring in the shallowest part of aquifers immediately below the water table which strongly enhances permeability and fracture apertures allen et al 1997 göppert and goldscheider 2008 hartmann et al 2014 the driving force of carbonate dissolution in carbonate aquifers is represented by elevated pco2 recharge water percolating through the soil zone atkinson 1977 palmer 1991 this is an active process in the critical zone at the university of leeds farm site in fact research on soil geochemistry at this site has revealed that agriculture activities increase decomposition rates of soil organic matter som this leads to an increase in the release of carbon dioxide from the soil into the groundwater with consequence pco2 increase holden et al 2018 as a consequence the most hazardous part of the critical zone for contaminant dispersal in these aquifer types is the uppermost highly permeable 10 m below the water table as depicted in the conceptual model in fig 11 reynolds number is up to 1 in this highly permeable upper part of the critical zone thus reynolds number 1 are likely to occur in more extensively faulted areas where more pervasive flow and carbonate dissolution has occurred in fact outcrop observations in areas close to extensional fault traces show cavities 0 1 0 7 cm in size in the dolostone of the cadeby formation single borehole pumping tests show in this aquifer much higher transmissivities in correspondence of faults t 790 1680 m2 day n 7 rather than within the unfaulted blocks t 15 210 m2 day n 16 likely to be a consequence of enhanced carbonate dissolution in association with faults allen et al 1997 cooper and lawley 2007 at our field site the hydraulic gradient and hence groundwater velocity does not significantly vary during the hydraulic year figs 7c 8a 9 this likely arises from the boundary conditions of the aquifer system at the university of leeds farm site i e streams coming from the adjacent hills to the west partially recharge the aquifer maintaining a stable hydraulic gradient aldrick 1978 these findings indicate how at least under conditions of relatively minor seasonal hydraulic variation changes in groundwater flow velocities with depth are much stronger than seasonal fluctuations in such conditions steady state groundwater flow models might be adequate to compute solute contaminant transport 4 6 2 future research future research on fracture flow carbonate aquifer types is needed in several directions we envisage efforts on both characterization of hydraulic conductivity versus depth and flow and contaminant transport modelling hydraulic conductivity can be better constrained in open wells using flow logging day lewis et al 2011 sawdey and reeve 2012 flute liner profiling quinn et al 2015 ren et al 2018a and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr testing walsh et al 2013 ren et al 2018b all these techniques that have been recently developed for fractured aquifers at shallow depths allow permeability characterization along the entire well rather than specific intervals this research has also shown how the limit of the laminar turbulent transition field can be reached even in non faulted blocks of carbonate rocks in absence of karstic cavities thus flow regime is likely to change as we approach areas of more developed carbonate dissolution such as extensional faults which are characterized by high transmissivities or systems of cavities connected to springs as seen in several carbonate aquifers across the world galdenzi and menichetti 1995 raeisi and karami 1997 gallegos et al 2013 bauer et al 2016 groundwater flow models need to be developed that can be implemented in correspondence of such structures i e to include likely occurrence of turbulence and higher groundwater flow velocities hill et al 2010 saller et al 2013 5 conclusions contaminant transport occurs at relatively high velocity in the saturated parts of shallow fractured aquifers and this may be very important in areas of arable and livestock farming activity here we report an investigation of the critical zone of a fractured dolostone aquifer permian dolostone of the cadeby formation beneath the university of leeds farm yorkshire a combination of fluid logging slug tests and hydraulic head monitoring was used outputs from these techniques were applied to a parallel plate model to determine the spectrum of flow velocities and establish occurrence of laminar or turbulent flow fluid temperature and conductivity logs identified the bedding plane fractures as principal flow pathways which is a common hydraulic feature in fractured carbonate aquifers hydraulic testing e g slug tests allows determination of the hydraulic fracture aperture by applying the cubic law determination of hydraulic gradient from hydraulic head monitoring then allows the determination of the spectrum of groundwater velocities in time and space indeed this workflow was applied at shallow 40 mbgl depths in a non faulted part of the permian dolostone of the cadeby formation it produced fracture flow velocities ranging from 13 up to 242 m day depth variations of fracture flow velocities are found much more significant than seasonal variations the upper 10 m immediately below the water table were most highly hydraulically conductive k h 0 30 2 85 m day and characterized by elevated groundwater flow velocities v 33 242 m day due to the processes of fracture aperture enhancement by carbonate dissolution which are typical of fractured carbonates hence these 10 m represent the most hazardous part of the critical zone for contaminant transport as a consequence we envisage further efforts on characterization of permeability with depth in the critical zone of fractured carbonate aquifers another key finding is that within unfaulted blocks in absence of large karstic cavities the reynolds number may reach 1 thus turbulent flow is likely to arise as we approach tectonic structures e g normal faults which are characterized by enhanced carbonate dissolution and macro karstic features groundwater flow models must be developed that represent flow as turbulent in correspondence of such tectonic structures the following are the supplementary data related to this article fig s1 fluid temperature and electric conductivity logs with indication

1593,gasohol spills may easily descend through the soil column down and impact sensitive receptors as contaminants dissolve into the groundwater gasoline formulations are commonly blended with ethanol to alleviate environmental and economic issues associated with fossil fuels however the amount of ethanol added to gasoline and the groundwater hydraulic regime can significantly affect btex plume dynamics and lifespan in this study two long term 5 and 10 years field scale gasohol releases with ethanol contents of 85 e85 and 24 e24 respectively were assessed to discern the different dynamics undergone by gasohol blends statistical geochemical microbiological and trend approaches were employed to estimate the influence of groundwater flow variations on ethanol and dissolved btex transport and the associated biodegradation rates of different gasohol blend spills ethanol and btex groundwater flow were quantified in terms of breakthrough curve characteristics plume centroid positions and spreading source depletion and mass degradation rates in addition bromide migration was evaluated to address the contribution of flow driven dissolution results revealed that the high amount of ethanol along with a fast and dynamic flow exerted a flushing behavior that enhanced btex dissolution migration vertical and horizontal and concentrations in groundwater the higher amount of ethanol in e85 enhanced btex dissolution and bioavailability relative to e24 site and led to faster biodegradation rates which can be explained by the cosolvency effect and metabolic flux dilution therefore flow field dynamics and high ethanol content in gasohol blends enhance btex migration and biodegradation in gasohol contaminated sites the balance of these factors is crucial to determine fate and transport of contaminants in field sites these findings suggest that hydraulic regime should be spatially and temporally characterized to support decisions on appropriate monitoring plan and remedial strategies for gasohol spills keywords transient flow dissolution btex plume spreading biodegradation rate transport 1 introduction gasohol spills by accidental or incidental releases may readily descend through the soil column and pollute the subsurface the dissolution of highly toxic and recalcitrant organic compounds present in gasoline can pose serious threats to human health and groundwater resources as they are transported away from the source and can potentially reach sensitive receptors ethanol was primarily added to gasoline to replace mtbe methyl tertiary butyl ether and reduce the environmental impacts related with mtbe high solubility and low biodegradation rates powers et al 2001 consequently the incidence of ethanol gasoline blends contamination increased as mtbe was phased out the fate and transport of the organic compounds in the subsurface are generally affected by several processes such as volatilization dissolution advection dispersion diffusion sorption and biological transformations schirmer and butler 2004 moreover the presence of ethanol and gasoline in fuel storage facilities or contaminated areas can also affect their degradation and mobility in groundwater and thus must be addressed to predict the fate of multiple organic compounds in dynamic aquifers molson et al 2002 high ethanol concentrations above 10 can exert a cosolvency effect on organic compounds present in gasoline formulations including priority contaminants such as monoaromatic hydrocarbons benzene toluene ethyl benzene xylenes known as btex and increase their dissolution into the aqueous phase powers et al 2001 corseuil et al 2004 this can lead to a fast and complete dissolution of napls non aqueous phase liquids source resulting in higher groundwater downgradient concentrations of recalcitrant and carcinogenic compounds e g benzene brooks et al 2004 that thereby increase the associated risk of exposure the effect of ethanol on gasoline spills in the subsurface has been extensively studied and the main observed features can be summarized as follows 1 cosolvency of several gasoline components e g btex enhancing their solubility in aqueous phase and remobilizing pre existing napls mcdowell et al 2003 falta 1998 jawitz et al 2000 2 collapse of capillary fringe which influences the vertical migration velocity and the lateral distribution of the free product zone henry and smith 2002 yu et al 2009 3 preferential ethanol biodegradation followed by the depletion of favorable electron acceptors e g o2 no3 fe3 etc and lower btex biodegradation rates corseuil et al 1998 mackay et al 2006 4 decreasing sorption related retardation of hydrocarbons da silva and alvarez 2002 5 microbial biostimulation and growth inhibition at high ethanol concentrations 10 g l 1 cápiro et al 2008 rasa et al 2013 in addition to this some studies underlined a preferential retention of ethanol in vadose zone and into capillary fringe due to the partitioning to the pore water mcdowell and powers 2003 nevertheless mcdowell and powers 2003 carried out their studies under stationary water table whereas natural water table fluctuations cause capillary fringe mixing fetter 2001 and may further release retained ethanol these confounding effects may be mitigated under laboratory conditions gomez et al 2008 yu et al 2009 however laboratory studies are unable to reproduce a complex natural environment or account for field site specific conditions and phenomena to discern the effect of ethanol in gasohol blends on aromatic hydrocarbons biodegradation freitas et al 2011 carried out field experiments of contaminant spills without ethanol e0 as well as in gasohol mixtures with 10 e10 and 95 e95 of ethanol the results demonstrated that btex biodegradation rates in groundwater were lower for high ethanol gasohol blends due to depletion of available dissolved oxygen whilst for the no ethanol spill and the low ethanol content blend no significant effect on btex biodegradation rates was observed conversely gomez and alvarez 2010 used a numerical model to study the effects of five alcohols on the natural attenuation of benzene and claimed that high ethanol content fuels i e e85 result in smaller shorter lived benzene plumes in groundwater when compared to low ethanol blends i e e10 corseuil et al 2011a observed a short lived inhibitory effect of ethanol and acetate on btex biodegradation demonstrating that monitored natural attenuation mna can be a viable remediation strategy to deal with gasohol residual sources e24 corseuil et al 2015 demonstrated the potential benefits of augmenting the electron acceptor pool with nitrate to accelerate ethanol removal mitigate its inhibitory effects on btex compounds and speed up their biodegradation lastly steiner et al 2018 showed that for gasohol blends with low ethanol content i e 10 mna can provide slightly higher btex degradation rates compared to nitrate biostimulation provided that the aquifer geochemical conditions offer a sufficient electron acceptor pool for aromatic hydrocarbons biodegradation field studies normally conduct limited spatial and temporal hydrogeological characterization of groundwater that can be conducive to unreliable monitoring plans and negatively affect remediation strategies shallow aquifers which are commonly affected by contamination often exhibit a significant temporal variability in water level position thickness of unsaturated and capillary zones and directions of groundwater flow which may affect migration dissolution and biodegradation rates davis et al 1999 prommer et al 2002 zhang et al 2009 rein et al 2009 showed through numerical simulations that transient flow conditions represent a critical source of uncertainties in field measurements as they are conducive to significant temporal fluctuations of the contaminants concentration in the monitoring wells dobson et al 2007 demonstrated that water table fluctuations in contaminated aquifers increased the elution of dissolved lnapl components and thus enhanced the risk of exposure of downgradient receptors in addition water table fluctuations along with transient changes in groundwater direction and flow focusing into highly permeable heterogeneities are claimed to be the main drivers for solute mixing especially for transverse plume spreading werth et al 2006 rolle et al 2009 since biodegradation rates may be controlled by the mixing process which supports interchanges between electron donor and acceptor cirpka et al 1999 recharge events may result in higher biodegradation rates by means of groundwater fluctuations and oxygen mixing schirmer et al 2000 although limited attention has been given towards transient hydraulic effects in full scale experiments they can have an overriding significance for monitoring plans and remediation strategies for gasohol spills in this contribution two long term 5 and 10 years controlled releases of gasohol blends e85 and e24 were monitored to discern the role exerted by groundwater flow dynamics on ethanol btex plumes migration and degradation rates this work aims to advance the current understanding on gasohol spills with different ethanol content and overall site remediation by addressing the contribution of groundwater flow field and site specific transport rates on ethanol and btex plume dynamics and lifespan 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the controlled releases of gasohol blends were carried out at ressacada experimental farm

geochemical and microbial analyses were employed to evaluate the different dynamics undergone by e85 and e24 blends in groundwater an exploratory analysis on concentrations was conducted for the conservative tracer bromide organic contaminants ethanol and btex and main metabolites methane and acetate the dataset was previously transformed to deal with the large amount of data assigned as below the detection limit bdl or non detected values nd means and standard deviations for each series were calculated from a linear regression of expected normal scores z scores gineval and splitstone 2003 the methodology consists in a linear regression of the known standard concentrations firstly converting the ranks of the data into cumulative percentiles observations from a normal distribution tend to fall on a straight line when plotted against their z scores even for nd values thus the fitting line intercept indicate the mean of distribution while the slope of the line gives the standard deviation such values were used to fix nds data following the same distribution of the raw data fig s1 supporting information hence a normal distribution was applied to nds in the dataset the cosolvency model was applied to distinguish the btex free product from the dissolved phase in full scale experiments with high ethanol blends corseuil and fernandes 1999 powers et al 2001 the model

trend analysis for bromide ethanol and btex were built using matlab to assess sites under natural attenuation with a well established and consistent monitoring over a given time frame ricker 2008 the

the site plume centroid position was obtained by the estimation of first order momentum a plume center of mass represents the centroid of interpolated contour plume conceptually it is a mass weighed mean of every unit volume along three main directions freyberg 1986 dentz et al 2000 the position of mass centroid was chosen to represent plume migration less sensitive to heterogeneous spatial distribution of contaminants finally neglecting the local scale mixing the estimation of central second order spatial moments provided direct plume spreading information cirpka 2002 therefore in order to quantify combined impacts of groundwater flow and the ethanol cosolvency in both areas plumes lifespan normalized dissolved mass centroid position distance to source spreading were plotted over time total accuracy of the method was equal to maximum mass recovery of dissolved bromide about 66 of initial released mass the mass losses can be related to experimental limitations such as spacing between monitoring wells and depth levels gaps between sampling events or spatial interpolation efficiency the linear fitting zero order kinetics of bromide mass decrease was used to represent migration of compounds forced by groundwater flow field beyond the assumed mask site specific transport rates were estimated by dividing bromide zero order fitting rates for the total bromide mass released first order kinetics are commonly used to describe btex and ethanol degradation rates in aquifers by fitting dissolved masses versus time to an exponential decay model alvarez and illman 2006 corseuil et al 2015 steiner et al 2018 nonetheless these rates do not discern between migration and biodegradation processes thus biodegradation rates were obtained by subtracting transport rates bromide advective dispersive transport related from the reactive compounds first order degradation rates finally ethanol and btex biodegradation rates were determined after the onset of ethanol and btex degradation 3 results and discussion 3 1 centroid analysis plume migration and groundwater flow field the ethanol content in different gasohol blends can markedly affect aromatic hydrocarbons dissolution into the groundwater accordingly in e85 plot btex compounds exhibited a faster and enhanced dissolution relative to e24 fig 3 this was attributed to the cosolvency effect exerted by high dissolved mass of ethanol 50 kg that thereby enhanced aromatic hydrocarbons dissolution and resulted in high btex plume concentrations 20 mg l 1 the fast ethanol and btex dissolution into the groundwater was evidenced by the peak of dissolved mass after 42 and 83 days respectively fig 3a and fig 3c this implies that high concentrations of dissolved btex can rapidly migrate away from the source zone enhancing the potential risk to downgradient sensitive receptors in contrast btex compounds dissolution and corresponding aqueous average concentrations were significantly lower in e24 site 5 mg l 1 as ethanol content was probably not high enough less than 15 kg to exert cosolvency effect the e24 site showed a typically slow dissolution of aromatic hydrocarbons corseuil et al 2011a reaching a maximum dissolved mass at 1000 days following the release which corresponded to the half of the observed percentage for btex in e85 plot fig 3c thus although the amount of gasoline released in e24 76 l was 2 5 times higher than in e85 30 l btex compounds exhibited an opposite trend by rapidly after 83 days reaching peak dissolved concentrations and dissolved mass percentage in e85 site due to the cosolvency effect exerted by the high ethanol content in the gasohol blend the cosolvency effect was more apparent for the higher molecular weight and less soluble btex compounds ethyl benzene and xylenes while benzene presented similar maximum dissolved percentage in both e24 and e85 sites fig 3b thus btex plot showed that 12 of initial mass was dissolved in e24 while such percentage increased to about 20 in e85 fig 3c this behavior is justified by the ratio of the saturation concentration enhanced by the cosolvency to the original compound solubility table s2 supporting information such ratio which increased with the molecular weight indicates the effect of the cosolvency on enhancing the maximum solubility of the compound and results in significantly higher dissolved mass for ethyl benzene 3 7 and xylenes 3 8 relative to benzene 1 9 hence the difference in the maximum dissolved mass between e24 and e85 was more pronounced for ethyl benzene and xylenes than benzene contaminant plumes are typically formed after compounds dissolve into the groundwater and their behavior e g position geometry is highly dependent on the hydraulic regime dobson et al 2007 accordingly at e85 the btex ethanol and bromide plumes migrated concomitantly at similar velocities between 4 5 and 6 2 m y 1 and followed the local groundwater flow direction moving faster in horizontal and downward directions as evidenced by the close position of centroids fig 4 and fig 5 conversely at e24 the bromide ethanol and btex plumes followed different migration pathways fig 5 the ethanol plume velocity was similar 3 0 m y 1 to bromide 2 6 m y 1 but significantly higher than btex 1 2 m y 1 which is probably due to a sorption related retardation of hydrocarbons fig 4 therefore at e24 the btex plume exhibited a limited migration of plume centroid 5 m away from the source when compared to e85 15 m during the same timespan fig 4c the different dynamics undergone by btex ethanol and bromide plumes in e85 and e24 sites was consistent with the average seepage velocities table 1 in addition a direct correlation between water table levels and seepage velocity was observed for both experimental sites fig s2 and fig s3 supporting information which was attributed to the periodic increase of hydraulic gradients due to the intense and prolonged rainfall events rama et al 2018 this led to transient accelerations in the transport of contaminants as the gradients are directly proportional to the seepage velocity thus ethanol apparently exerted influence on btex compounds dissolution in the source zone that was conducive to high groundwater concentrations while plume dynamics were predominantly affected by hydraulic effects and groundwater flow the larger variability in groundwater direction and hydraulic gradient enhanced transversal spreading of plumes accordingly despite the lower seepage velocity at e24 the bromide plume showed an enhanced dispersion relative to e85 fig 5a which is reflected by more dynamic groundwater flow table 1 these findings agreed with bellin et al 1996 who showed a plume dispersion affected by instability of the hydraulic gradient over time likewise the total range of directions in e24 reached 90 whereas in the e85 site it was limited to 30 fig 1c the e85 site was characterized by a slower shift of flow direction with long periods 2 6 months in which groundwater flow presented homogeneous deviations from the average direction low water levels were highly correlated with negative deviations of groundwater direction as opposed to the higher levels that were associated with positive deviations fig s2 supporting information suggesting an existence of a low conductivity layer in the aquifer which is probably dipped towards the east comparatively in the e24 experiment a more pronounced and quicker variability in the flow direction was observed fig s3 supporting information the data suggests a random rotation of groundwater direction during intense rainfall events with no evident correlation with hydraulic heads which was likely attributed to the position of the finer and consequently less conductive material in the e24 site heterogeneities in permeability along with impulsive precipitation and differences in land use led to a different infiltration regime and thus a local variability in transient groundwater flow directions and recharge it is worth highlighting that as little as 10 15 of fine material admixture in a soil profile is enough to confer a low permeability character of the porous medium mitchell 1976 thus despite its geological homogeneity at regional scale the existing clay content in the site up to 20 is sufficient to significantly influence the local flow field and the migration of compounds in addition the close relation between small low permeability lenses and hydrodynamic dispersion werth et al 2006 or back diffusion of contaminants chapman and parker 2005 yang et al 2014 has been shown this is also consistent with the enhanced plume spreading in the e24 relative to e85 site fig 5 the sharp water table fluctuations may prevent the retention of dissolved compounds within and above the capillary fringe the e85 mass center moved vertically very quickly when compared with the e24 site fig 5 for example at the e85 site between 257 and 506 days from release the ethanol centroid moved more than 1 5 m downwards and 7 m in a horizontal direction away from the source while btex plume migrated 1 m vertically and about 5 m horizontally such high velocities of contaminants vertical transport is likely due to the sudden water table oscillations recharge related that literally drag solutes downward similar to a natural vertical flushing of the source zone conversely in e24 site the consistently lower conductivity of e24 relative to e85 limited compounds transport as evidenced by the low bromide 1 5 m downwards over 1821 days and ethanol 1 m downwards over whole monitoring period centroid vertical migration fig 5 nevertheless since the amplitude of water table fluctuations was similar in both sites fig s2 and fig s3 supporting information the aquifer in e24 probably discharged laterally the flow related to the high hydraulic heads as is the case for wetlands hayashi et al 2016 thus the high variability of groundwater direction at the e24 may be caused by a hanged up fill and spill system tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 with an irregular groundwater connectivity it is worth noting that the influence of vertical infiltration from precipitation events was dismissed as both sites were covered with plastic impermeable canvas and gravel therefore the plumes behavior is attributed to the combined effects of natural darcy s flow with bottom up variations in water table levels the field data show that the transient flow regime directly affected spreading and position of the contaminants plumes davis et al 1999 the flow field assessment indicated that the water table plane in both experiments rotates in time depending on the condition of recharge heterogeneities and soil saturation the faster and more regular groundwater flow in the e85 site seemed to be mainly related to the precipitation regime while the highly variable flow field in the e24 site was probably forced to a lateral movement by hanged clay lenses and geological heterogeneities 3 2 geochemical footprint of e85 release the statistical analysis depicted a lognormal distribution of ethanol and bromide concentrations at each sampling event for e85 plot fig 6 violin plots median values showed the faster dissolution of ethanol that peaked only 5 days after the release while bromide maximum dissolution occurred 83 days after the release since bromide and the gasohol blend were released together such differences reflect the higher aqueous solubility of ethanol relative to bromide in addition violin plots revealed a smoother variation of bromide shapes over time relative to the highly irregular ethanol distribution this can be attributed to the conservative behavior of bromide as opposed to the highly biodegradable ethanol a highly variable water table may enhance btex dissolution from the source or the free product zone fpz and the subsequent outcome would be a vertical downward migration of contaminants as the water table descends in gasohol spills the dissolved ethanol which floats on the top of an aquifer can remobilize retained btex in the vadose zone mcdowell et al 2003 falta 1998 this seems to be the case of the e85 source area as the high dissolved concentrations of btex coincided with the increase in water level and the intense recharge events fig 7 the contaminants ethanol and btex rapidly reached the water table moving vertically 1 3 m in one day fig 5 such fast migration was attributed to the root channels and other preferential transport pathways jarvis 2007 which along with the high solubility of ethanol facilitates the movement the high amount of ethanol could have also reduced the sorption of hydrocarbons contributing to the vertical transfer of btex as well da silva and alvarez 2002 during the initial water level increase between 5 and 6 days after the release the average concentration of btex in the aqueous phase increased about 10 times whereas after 20 days a pronounced rising of aquifer water table resulted in a pulse enhanced concentration up to three fold lastly between 42 and 83 days after the release average concentrations of btex doubled and maximum values per sampling event continued to increase because of the high hydraulic head of the aquifer fig 7 thus data confirmed a correlation between rainfall driven processes e g recharge water table variation and the increasing dissolved btex concentrations in the source zone table s3 supporting information the combined effects of ethanol and aquifer fluctuation must be carefully accounted in sites impacted by gasohol spills as they can accelerate dissolution process and may compromise remediation plans based on the slow transfer hypotheses of persistent lnapl sources that generally results in long lasting contaminations free phase product sample fps occurrences started 18 days after the release when the water table reached 2 25 m above sea level 0 7 m depth underneath the source underlining a correlation between aquifer oscillation and napl migration hence after 42 days dual phase samples collected at 3 m depth were dragged down with water table descent between 27 and 42 days in addition groundwater samples highlighted a remarkable lateral migration of napl probably due to the collapse of capillary fringe exerted by the high amount of ethanol twenty five fps were detected between 20 and 83 days after release in different wells mw f mw 2 mw 5 mw 7 mw 8 mw 10 and mw 11 if they were accounted within the source region in only 42 days the initial spill area increased from 1 5 m2 in the vadose zone to at least 5 6 m2 of fpz on the top of saturated zone these findings suggest that high ethanol content blends can lead to the fast napl mobilization due to ethanol driven cosolvency and collapse of capillary fringe resulting in large and irregular fpzs however despite the complexity of fpz dissolved ethanol btex compounds in the e85 site exhibited a comparable plume evolution figs 4 and 5 showing similar and uniform shapes which is consistent with yu et al 2009 observations therefore our data demonstrate that ethanol content or transiency of groundwater flow exerts a larger influence on dissolved plume behavior when compared to the geometry of the contamination source btex mass transfer in the e85 site was similar to an ethanol flushing of the source jawitz et al 2000 brooks et al 2004 to exemplify btex was readily transferred to the aqueous phase the peaks occurred between 40 and 85 days and exhibited low persistence reaching concentrations 7 μg l 1 close to remediation goals within 1600 days after release comparatively such low source zone concentrations were observed at the e24 site only after 5000 days following the release although the highly soluble ethanol generally dissolves earlier than btex corseuil et al 2011a as a result of the limited aqueous solubility of the aromatic compounds the breakthrough curves btc in e85 plot showed peak concentrations of both ethanol and btex at the beginning of the experiment as compounds migrated away from the source peak concentrations of ethanol and btex were concomitantly detected in the mws located in the main groundwater flow direction demonstrating their concurrent dissolution and migration fig 8 likewise centroid locations also indicated a pronounced migration of ethanol and btex plumes in e85 site fig 4 fig 5 which is coherent with compounds enhanced dissolution exerted by the site hydraulic effects and the high ethanol content of the gasohol blend the decrease in ethanol and btex concentrations was accompanied by the production of their anaerobic metabolites acetate and methane thus providing evidence of ethanol and btex biodegradation fig 8c d the flow field characteristics can predict the migration of dissolved contaminants plumes and thereby support the decision on the most appropriate monitoring strategy contaminants concentration per sampling level indicated a sinking process of the dissolved compounds in the e85 the source zone wells revealed high contaminants concentration at the upper level 2 m bgs whereas at distant monitoring wells mw 23 and mw 28 located at 10 and 14 m away from the source respectively contaminants concentrated on the deeper levels 5 and 6 m bgs likewise as previously mentioned in section 3 1 the same phenomenon was observed for the e24 site although it was less pronounced the vertical drift is directly associated with the local flow field that contributes to a downward movement of the compounds in addition a plume inspection along a transect located 14 m away from the source shows the highest concentrations at 4 m bgs from the western boundary mw 27 in fig 9a and 6 m bgs from the eastern boundary mw 31 in fig 9c this nonhomogeneous distribution of concentrations is probably caused by a low permeability formation dipped towards the east that corroborates the anti clockwise rotation of the main groundwater direction during dry periods supporting information such changes in plume direction could be predicted with a time series analysis of the flow field at contaminated sites this underscores the importance of conducting a thorough hydrogeological assessment to properly select groundwater monitoring wells and track contaminants plume migration 3 3 ethanol and btex degradation kinetics the faster dissolution of btex observed in the e85 site relative to e24 was attributed to the higher amount of ethanol that exerted cosolvency effect fig 3 accordingly both btex and ethanol mass peaked at 85 days after the release fig 11 thus demonstrating a similar dissolution dynamics degradation rates were determined after the onset of ethanol and btex biodegradation and as they peaked concomitantly similar initial timeframes were considered in the calculations table 2 unlike e85 in the e24 site btex concentrations peaked after 970 days and the onset of their biodegradation was observed only after ethanol depletion fig 11 it is worth noting that control experiments with gasoline alone would be useful to quantitatively discern the effects of ethanol the conservative tracer bromide zero order mass decrease was used to represent migration of dissolved compounds forced by groundwater flow field at both experimental sites and to estimate transport rates results revealed a transport rate three times higher in e85 0 242 y 1 than e24 0 092 y 1 table 3 which coincided with the flow field analysis section 3 1 this difference in mass decrease transport related follows the ratio of seepage velocities between the sites which can potentially avoid confounding effects in the estimation of contaminants biodegradation rates since the area with faster flow e85 also presented higher fitted decay rates it worth stressing that fitted mass degradation values for ethanol and btex table 2 agreed with results reported by other studies that used different methodologies corseuil et al 2011a corseuil et al 2015 ramos et al 2016 steiner et al 2018 after subtracting specific transport rates from the reactive compounds degradation the resulting first order biodegradation rates were ethanol 1 104 y 1 e85 and 1 076 y 1 e24 benzene 0 836 y 1 e85 and 0 674 y 1 e24 and in average for total btex 0 816 y 1 e85 and 0 401 y 1 e24 table 2 these values are consistent with the range of rates reported elsewhere for ethanol and btex compounds alvarez et al 1991 corseuil et al 1998 therefore the enhanced dissolution of btex in e85 site led to higher biodegradation rates relative to btex in e24 site the higher btex biodegradation rates in e85 relative to e24 site could be attributed to the metabolic flux dilution phenomenon as it predicts that removal rates are proportional to the fraction of the available substrates in the mixture lovanh and alvarez 2004 accordingly the metabolic flux dilution in e85 was evaluated at the source zone mw 11 and compared with source zone sw4 at e24 site corseuil et al 2015 the enhanced dissolution and availability of btex in e85 site increased their source zone fraction in the mixture ethanol btex as opposed to the lower dissolved btex concentrations and corresponding fraction in the mixture in e24 site fig 10 therefore higher biodegradation rates were observed for btex in e85 site which was likely due to their enhanced fraction in the mixture relative to e24 site this is consistent with metabolic flux dilution that considers the simultaneous degradation of multiple substrates with compound specific degradation rates being proportional to their relative abundance in the mixture the higher removal rates observed for the e85 site are coherent with the stimulation of biomass and specific hydrocarbon degraders accordingly after 72 days following the release total biomass growth increased up to 2 orders of magnitude 2 5 109 gene copies g 1 relative to the background concentration at the source zone 3 107 gene copies g 1 this is consistent with the organic compounds infiltration and dissolution into the groundwater as they were likely used as substrates for microbial growth the migration of dissolved contaminants away from the source figs 12 and 13 was reflected by the decrease in total biomass source zone concentration at 918 days after the release reaching a condition similar to the background 2 9 107 gene copies g 1 that was observed until the end of the monitoring period 4 5 107 gene copies g 1 at 1532 days after e85 release fig 12 thus although contaminants were partly consumed as substrates the transport was likely the driving force as evidenced by the plume migration over the site which justifies the return towards the original unpolluted state baseline microbial condition at the source zone likewise sequencing results revealed the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons degraders gouta 19 treponema wchb1 05 kaistobacter geobacter rhodoplanes sphingomonas at the monitoring wells evaluated mw s mw 23 and mw 25 fig 13a and b which is coherent with their exposure to btex compounds anaerobic genera dominated wells mw 23 and mw 25 which was likely due to the presence of residual concentrations of btex 132 and 241 μg l 1 that generally depletes the available dissolved oxygen and leads to the establishment of anaerobic zones as evidenced by the negative orp values 36 and 1 mv and methane production 8 5 and 4 mg l 1 comparatively the source zone microbial profile at 1532 days was mainly composed by aerobic genera which can be supported by the absence of btex compounds at the source after 1532 days the positive orp value 222 mv and methane concentration below the detection limit 10 μg l 1 detailed information about the metabolism and respiration mode of the microbial genera detected in e85 site is available in the supporting information table s4 these findings provide converging lines of evidence of btex migration over the site and biodegradation thus indicating that molecular biology can be used as a complementary tool for groundwater pollution monitoring as communities shift according to the transient flow and geochemical conditions encountered at the site 4 conclusions spills of gasohol blends into phreatic aquifers subject to high recharge rates and sharp water table fluctuations can undergo enhanced migration and degradation transient variations in groundwater flow velocity and direction caused by the changes in recharge as well as geological heterogeneity can enhance source dissolution resulting in greater plume spreading and migration this has significant implications for effective monitoring of groundwater pollutants and plume dynamics and lifespan in controlled gasohol spills at ressacada brazil the sharp water table fluctuations observed in e85 site dragged the compounds downwards showing a fast vertical migration while this effect was less pronounced in e24 site due to the lower hydraulic conductivity and the position of low conductivity layers specific migration of bromide plumes showed significant differences in transport rates between the e85 faster and e24 slower sites despite the fact that both sites are located at neighboring areas 400 m of distance the higher seepage velocity in e85 relative to e24 resulted in a faster horizontal migration of plume center of mass 15 and 5 m for e85 and e24 respectively which underscores the critical influence of local flow field in contaminated sites assessment and the importance of subtracting flow driven rates from the decay rates obtained by fitting field data to isolate biodegradation rates the high amount of ethanol in e85 site exerted cosolvency effect on btex and thereby enhanced their dissolution within 85 days and average concentrations up to 20 mgl 1 in groundwater the high concentrations of btex led to faster degradation rates relative to e24 site and btex and ethanol were biodegraded concomitantly as opposed to the often observed ethanol preferential biodegradation this was likely attributed to the metabolic flux dilution phenomenon as the relative biodegradability of a compound in a mixture of alternative substrates is often concentration dependent and the degradation rates are proportional to their fraction in the substrates mixture therefore btex and ethanol were biodegraded at similar rates comparatively in e24 site btex dissolution was significantly slower maximum after 1000 days and the onset of btex dissolution and biodegradation was only observed after ethanol depletion accordingly btex degradation rates were slower 0 401 y 1 relative to 0 816 y 1 and mass depletion was delayed after 3800 days relative to 1600 days following the release relative to e85 site total biomass was stimulated as ethanol and btex dissolved into the groundwater and shifts in microbial communities were driven by the transient flow and geochemical groundwater conditions at the e85 site thus although the high amount of ethanol in e85 site enhanced btex dissolution it led to fast degradation rates that speeded up btex compounds biodegradation while their migration was determined by the local groundwater flow overall the practical implication of this work is that the groundwater flow field and high ethanol content in gasohol blends can significantly affect plume dynamics and lifespan especially at sites under high recharge rates or fast groundwater flow accordingly e85 site due to a faster groundwater flow showed an increased migration of contaminants relative to e24 2 6 times higher but also exhibited higher biodegradation rates 2 0 times higher whilst e24 demonstrated a lower plume mobility and longer lasting contamination due to the reduced biodegradation rates relative to e85 these factors must be carefully accounted to estimate the risk for downgradient receptors and to support decisions on monitoring plans and remedial actions simplified approaches that focus solely on a single component of the balance e g degradation kinetics cannot thoroughly assess plume behavior especially in highly fluctuant or heterogeneous aquifers acknowledgements the authors

1593,gasohol spills may easily descend through the soil column down and impact sensitive receptors as contaminants dissolve into the groundwater gasoline formulations are commonly blended with ethanol to alleviate environmental and economic issues associated with fossil fuels however the amount of ethanol added to gasoline and the groundwater hydraulic regime can significantly affect btex plume dynamics and lifespan in this study two long term 5 and 10 years field scale gasohol releases with ethanol contents of 85 e85 and 24 e24 respectively were assessed to discern the different dynamics undergone by gasohol blends statistical geochemical microbiological and trend approaches were employed to estimate the influence of groundwater flow variations on ethanol and dissolved btex transport and the associated biodegradation rates of different gasohol blend spills ethanol and btex groundwater flow were quantified in terms of breakthrough curve characteristics plume centroid positions and spreading source depletion and mass degradation rates in addition bromide migration was evaluated to address the contribution of flow driven dissolution results revealed that the high amount of ethanol along with a fast and dynamic flow exerted a flushing behavior that enhanced btex dissolution migration vertical and horizontal and concentrations in groundwater the higher amount of ethanol in e85 enhanced btex dissolution and bioavailability relative to e24 site and led to faster biodegradation rates which can be explained by the cosolvency effect and metabolic flux dilution therefore flow field dynamics and high ethanol content in gasohol blends enhance btex migration and biodegradation in gasohol contaminated sites the balance of these factors is crucial to determine fate and transport of contaminants in field sites these findings suggest that hydraulic regime should be spatially and temporally characterized to support decisions on appropriate monitoring plan and remedial strategies for gasohol spills keywords transient flow dissolution btex plume spreading biodegradation rate transport 1 introduction gasohol spills by accidental or incidental releases may readily descend through the soil column and pollute the subsurface the dissolution of highly toxic and recalcitrant organic compounds present in gasoline can pose serious threats to human health and groundwater resources as they are transported away from the source and can potentially reach sensitive receptors ethanol was primarily added to gasoline to replace mtbe methyl tertiary butyl ether and reduce the environmental impacts related with mtbe high solubility and low biodegradation rates powers et al 2001 consequently the incidence of ethanol gasoline blends contamination increased as mtbe was phased out the fate and transport of the organic compounds in the subsurface are generally affected by several processes such as volatilization dissolution advection dispersion diffusion sorption and biological transformations schirmer and butler 2004 moreover the presence of ethanol and gasoline in fuel storage facilities or contaminated areas can also affect their degradation and mobility in groundwater and thus must be addressed to predict the fate of multiple organic compounds in dynamic aquifers molson et al 2002 high ethanol concentrations above 10 can exert a cosolvency effect on organic compounds present in gasoline formulations including priority contaminants such as monoaromatic hydrocarbons benzene toluene ethyl benzene xylenes known as btex and increase their dissolution into the aqueous phase powers et al 2001 corseuil et al 2004 this can lead to a fast and complete dissolution of napls non aqueous phase liquids source resulting in higher groundwater downgradient concentrations of recalcitrant and carcinogenic compounds e g benzene brooks et al 2004 that thereby increase the associated risk of exposure the effect of ethanol on gasoline spills in the subsurface has been extensively studied and the main observed features can be summarized as follows 1 cosolvency of several gasoline components e g btex enhancing their solubility in aqueous phase and remobilizing pre existing napls mcdowell et al 2003 falta 1998 jawitz et al 2000 2 collapse of capillary fringe which influences the vertical migration velocity and the lateral distribution of the

concentrations 10 g l 1 cápiro et al 2008 rasa et al 2013 in addition to this some studies underlined a preferential retention of ethanol in vadose zone and into capillary fringe due to the partitioning to the pore water mcdowell and powers 2003 nevertheless mcdowell and powers 2003 carried out their studies under stationary water table whereas natural water table fluctuations cause capillary fringe mixing fetter 2001 and may further release retained ethanol these confounding effects may be mitigated under laboratory conditions gomez et al 2008 yu et al 2009 however laboratory studies are unable to reproduce a complex natural environment or account for field site specific conditions and phenomena to discern the effect of ethanol in gasohol blends on aromatic hydrocarbons biodegradation freitas et al 2011 carried out field experiments of contaminant spills without ethanol e0 as well as in gasohol mixtures with 10 e10 and 95 e95 of ethanol the results demonstrated that btex biodegradation rates in groundwater were lower for high ethanol gasohol blends due to depletion of available dissolved oxygen whilst for the no ethanol spill and the low ethanol content blend no significant effect on btex biodegradation rates was observed conversely gomez and alvarez 2010 used a numerical model to study the effects of five alcohols on the natural attenuation of benzene and claimed that high ethanol content fuels i e e85 result in smaller shorter lived benzene plumes in groundwater when compared to low ethanol blends i e e10 corseuil et al 2011a observed a short lived inhibitory effect of ethanol and acetate on btex biodegradation demonstrating that monitored natural attenuation mna can be a viable remediation strategy to deal with gasohol residual sources e24 corseuil et al 2015 demonstrated the potential benefits of augmenting the electron acceptor pool with nitrate to accelerate ethanol removal mitigate its inhibitory effects on btex compounds and speed up their biodegradation lastly steiner et al 2018 showed that for gasohol blends with low ethanol content i e 10 mna can provide slightly higher btex degradation rates compared to nitrate biostimulation provided that the aquifer geochemical conditions offer a sufficient electron acceptor pool for aromatic hydrocarbons biodegradation field studies normally conduct limited spatial and temporal hydrogeological characterization of groundwater that can be conducive to unreliable monitoring plans and negatively affect remediation strategies shallow aquifers which are commonly affected by contamination often exhibit a significant temporal variability in water level position thickness of unsaturated and capillary zones and directions of groundwater flow which may affect migration dissolution and biodegradation rates davis et al 1999 prommer et al 2002 zhang et al 2009 rein et al 2009 showed through numerical simulations that transient flow conditions represent a critical source of uncertainties in field measurements as they are conducive to significant temporal fluctuations of the contaminants concentration in the monitoring wells dobson et al 2007 demonstrated that water table fluctuations in contaminated aquifers increased the elution of dissolved lnapl components and thus enhanced the risk of exposure of downgradient receptors in addition water table fluctuations along with transient changes in groundwater direction and flow focusing into highly permeable heterogeneities are claimed to be the main drivers for solute mixing especially for transverse plume spreading werth et al 2006 rolle et al 2009 since biodegradation rates may be controlled by the mixing process which supports interchanges between electron donor and acceptor cirpka et al 1999 recharge events may result in higher biodegradation rates by means of groundwater fluctuations and oxygen mixing schirmer et al 2000 although limited attention has been given towards transient hydraulic effects in full scale experiments they can have an overriding significance for monitoring plans and remediation strategies for gasohol spills in this contribution two long term 5 and 10 years controlled releases of gasohol blends e85 and e24 were monitored to discern the role exerted by groundwater flow dynamics on ethanol btex plumes migration and degradation rates this work aims to advance the current understanding on gasohol spills with different ethanol content and overall site remediation by addressing the contribution of groundwater flow field and site specific transport rates on ethanol and btex plume dynamics and lifespan 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the controlled releases of gasohol blends were carried out at ressacada experimental farm

evidences loe were used to discern the ongoing predominant biotic and abiotic processes in the experimental sites accordingly in order to associate plume migration maximum concentration occurrences and flow field variations geometrical rules were applied to triangulate information from monitored head records simplifying the unconfined aquifer with a plane as depicted in fig 2a the plane was defined by passing through three points to establish the dip angle and direction strike 90 which represent the water table inclination and the direction of groundwater flow respectively in addition geochemical and microbial analyses were employed to evaluate the different dynamics undergone by e85 and e24 blends in groundwater an exploratory analysis on concentrations was conducted for the conservative tracer bromide organic contaminants ethanol and btex and main metabolites methane and acetate the dataset was previously transformed to deal with the large amount of data assigned as below the detection limit bdl or non detected values nd means and standard deviations for each series were calculated from a linear regression of expected normal scores z scores gineval and splitstone 2003 the methodology consists in a linear regression of the known standard concentrations firstly converting the ranks of the data into cumulative percentiles observations from a normal distribution tend to fall on a straight line when plotted against their z scores even for nd values thus the fitting line intercept indicate the mean of distribution while the slope of the line gives the standard deviation such values were used to fix nds data following the same distribution of the raw data fig s1 supporting information hence a normal distribution was applied to nds in the dataset the cosolvency model was applied to distinguish the btex free product from the dissolved phase in full scale experiments with high ethanol blends corseuil and fernandes 1999 powers et al 2001 the model states that ethanol a hydrophilic compound can reduce the polarity of aqueous phase modifying the solubility of hydrocarbons in groundwater systems and enhancing the saturation concentration based on raoult s law detailed information about the calculus of the saturation concentration of btex at e85 site is available in the supporting information table s2 the dissolution and persistence of ethanol and btex in groundwater as well as the production of their corresponding metabolites acetate and methane were graphically depicted on the breakthrough curves of concentration btc plume stability and trend analysis for bromide ethanol and btex were built using matlab to assess sites under natural attenuation with a well established and consistent monitoring over a given time frame ricker 2008 the method is applied only to dissolved contaminants and corresponds to a combination of graphical and statistical analysis based on the spatial interpolation of data from multilevel monitoring wells in the experimental site aiming to define isocontour maps for every compound depth levels and se this allows the calculation of dissolved mass in every se by summing results per level detection limits dl were used to contour plumes for each compound while a 35 30 5 5 m domain was applied for e24 area a 33 33 7 m domain was used for the interpolation of e85 data both deploying a regular grid spacing of 0 1 0 1 0 25 m a mask was adopted to limit extrapolated values out of the monitored sites fig 2b raw concentration data were log transformed to obtain normal distribution and reduced coefficient of variation ratio of standard deviation and mean and kriging interpolator was used to plot contour maps the zero order momentum of concentration over time was used to estimate total dissolved mass at the site plume centroid position was obtained by the estimation of first order momentum a plume center of mass represents the centroid of interpolated contour plume conceptually it is a mass weighed mean of every unit volume along three main directions freyberg 1986 dentz et al 2000 the position of mass centroid was chosen to represent plume migration less sensitive to heterogeneous spatial distribution of contaminants finally neglecting the local scale mixing the estimation of central second order spatial moments provided direct plume spreading information cirpka 2002 therefore in order to quantify combined impacts of groundwater flow and the ethanol cosolvency in both areas plumes lifespan normalized dissolved mass centroid position distance to source spreading were plotted over time total accuracy of the method was equal to maximum mass recovery of dissolved bromide about 66 of initial released mass the mass losses can be related to experimental limitations such as spacing between monitoring wells and depth levels gaps between sampling events or spatial interpolation efficiency the linear fitting zero order kinetics of bromide mass decrease was used to represent migration of compounds forced by groundwater flow field beyond the assumed mask site specific transport rates were estimated by dividing bromide zero order fitting rates for the total bromide mass released first order kinetics are commonly used to describe btex and ethanol degradation rates in aquifers by fitting dissolved masses versus time to an exponential decay model alvarez and illman 2006 corseuil et al 2015 steiner et al 2018 nonetheless these rates do not discern between migration and biodegradation processes thus biodegradation rates were obtained by subtracting transport rates bromide advective dispersive transport related from the reactive compounds first order degradation rates finally ethanol and btex biodegradation rates were determined after the onset of ethanol and btex degradation 3 results and discussion 3 1 centroid analysis plume migration and groundwater flow field the ethanol content in different gasohol blends can markedly affect aromatic hydrocarbons dissolution into the groundwater accordingly in e85 plot btex compounds exhibited a faster and enhanced dissolution relative to e24 fig 3 this was attributed to the cosolvency effect exerted by high dissolved mass of ethanol 50 kg that thereby enhanced aromatic hydrocarbons dissolution and resulted in high btex plume concentrations 20 mg l 1 the fast ethanol and btex dissolution into the groundwater was evidenced by the peak of dissolved mass after 42 and 83 days respectively fig 3a and fig 3c this implies that high concentrations of dissolved btex can rapidly migrate away from the source zone enhancing the potential risk to downgradient sensitive receptors in contrast btex compounds dissolution and corresponding aqueous average concentrations were significantly lower in e24 site 5 mg l 1 as ethanol content was probably not high enough less than 15 kg to exert cosolvency effect the e24 site showed a typically slow dissolution of aromatic hydrocarbons corseuil et al 2011a reaching a maximum dissolved mass at 1000 days following the release which corresponded to the half of the observed percentage for btex in e85 plot fig 3c thus although the amount of gasoline released in e24 76 l was 2 5 times higher than in e85 30 l btex compounds exhibited an opposite trend by rapidly after 83 days reaching peak dissolved concentrations and dissolved mass percentage in e85 site due to the cosolvency effect exerted by the high ethanol content in the gasohol blend the cosolvency effect was more apparent for the higher molecular weight and less soluble btex compounds ethyl benzene and xylenes while benzene presented similar maximum dissolved percentage in both e24 and e85 sites fig 3b thus btex plot showed that 12 of initial mass was dissolved in e24 while such percentage increased to about 20 in e85 fig 3c this behavior is justified by the ratio of the saturation concentration enhanced by the cosolvency to the original compound solubility table s2 supporting information such ratio which increased with the molecular weight indicates the effect of the cosolvency on enhancing the maximum solubility of the compound and results in significantly higher dissolved mass for ethyl benzene 3 7 and xylenes 3 8 relative to benzene 1 9 hence the difference in the maximum dissolved mass between e24 and e85 was more pronounced for ethyl benzene and xylenes than benzene contaminant plumes are typically formed after compounds dissolve into the groundwater and their behavior e g position geometry is highly dependent on the hydraulic regime dobson et al 2007 accordingly at e85 the btex ethanol and bromide plumes migrated concomitantly at similar velocities between 4 5 and 6 2 m y 1 and followed the local groundwater flow direction moving faster in horizontal and downward directions as evidenced by the close position of centroids fig 4 and fig 5 conversely at e24 the bromide ethanol and btex plumes followed different migration pathways fig 5 the ethanol plume velocity was similar 3 0 m y 1 to bromide 2 6 m y 1 but significantly higher than btex 1 2 m y 1 which is probably due to a sorption related retardation of hydrocarbons fig 4 therefore at e24 the btex plume exhibited a limited migration of plume centroid 5 m away from the source when compared to e85 15 m during the same timespan fig 4c the different dynamics undergone by btex ethanol and bromide plumes in e85 and e24 sites was consistent with the average seepage velocities table 1 in addition a direct correlation between water table levels and seepage velocity was observed for both experimental sites fig s2 and fig s3 supporting information which was attributed to the periodic increase of hydraulic gradients due to the intense and prolonged rainfall events rama et al 2018 this led to transient accelerations in the transport of contaminants as the gradients are directly proportional to the seepage velocity thus ethanol apparently exerted influence on btex compounds dissolution in the source zone that was conducive to high groundwater concentrations while plume dynamics were predominantly affected by hydraulic effects and groundwater flow the larger variability in groundwater direction and hydraulic gradient enhanced transversal spreading of plumes accordingly despite the lower seepage velocity at e24 the bromide plume showed an enhanced dispersion relative to e85 fig 5a which is reflected by more dynamic groundwater flow table 1 these findings agreed with bellin et al 1996 who showed a plume dispersion affected by instability of the hydraulic gradient over time likewise the total range of directions in e24 reached 90 whereas in the e85 site it was limited to 30 fig 1c the e85 site was characterized by a slower shift of flow direction with long periods 2 6 months in which groundwater flow presented homogeneous deviations from the average direction low water levels were highly correlated with negative deviations of groundwater direction as opposed to the higher levels that were associated with positive deviations fig s2 supporting information suggesting an existence of a low conductivity layer in the aquifer which is probably dipped towards the east comparatively in the e24 experiment a more pronounced and quicker variability in the flow direction was observed fig s3 supporting information the data suggests a random rotation of groundwater direction during intense rainfall events with no evident correlation with hydraulic heads which was likely attributed to the position of the finer and consequently less conductive material in the e24 site heterogeneities in permeability along with impulsive precipitation and differences in land use led to a different infiltration regime and thus a local variability in transient groundwater flow directions and recharge it is worth highlighting that as little as 10 15 of fine material admixture in a soil profile is enough to confer a low permeability character of the porous medium mitchell 1976 thus despite its geological homogeneity at regional scale the existing clay content in the site up to 20 is sufficient to significantly influence the local flow field and the migration of compounds in addition the close relation between small low permeability lenses and hydrodynamic dispersion werth et al 2006 or back diffusion of contaminants chapman and parker 2005 yang et al 2014 has been shown this is also consistent with the enhanced plume spreading in the e24 relative to e85 site fig 5 the sharp water table fluctuations may prevent the retention of dissolved compounds within and above the capillary fringe the e85 mass center moved vertically very quickly when compared with the e24 site fig 5 for example at the e85 site between 257 and 506 days from release the ethanol centroid moved more than 1 5 m downwards and 7 m in a horizontal direction away from the source while btex plume migrated 1 m vertically and about 5 m horizontally such high velocities of contaminants vertical transport is likely due to the sudden water table oscillations recharge related that literally drag solutes downward similar to a natural vertical flushing of the source zone conversely in e24 site the consistently lower conductivity of e24 relative to e85 limited compounds transport as evidenced by the low bromide 1 5 m downwards over 1821 days and ethanol 1 m downwards over whole monitoring period centroid vertical migration fig 5 nevertheless since the amplitude of water table fluctuations was similar in both sites fig s2 and fig s3 supporting information the aquifer in e24 probably discharged laterally the flow related to the high hydraulic heads as is the case for wetlands hayashi et al 2016 thus the high variability of groundwater direction at the e24 may be caused by a hanged up fill and spill system tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 with an irregular groundwater connectivity it is worth noting that the influence of vertical infiltration from precipitation events was dismissed as both sites were covered with plastic impermeable canvas and gravel therefore the plumes behavior is attributed to the combined effects of natural darcy s flow with bottom up variations in water table levels the field data show that the transient flow regime directly affected spreading and position of the contaminants plumes davis et al 1999 the flow field assessment indicated that the water table plane in both experiments rotates in time depending on the condition of recharge heterogeneities and soil saturation the faster and more regular groundwater flow in the e85 site seemed to be mainly related to the precipitation regime while the highly variable flow field in the e24 site was probably forced to a lateral movement by hanged clay lenses and geological heterogeneities 3 2 geochemical footprint of e85 release the statistical analysis depicted a lognormal distribution of ethanol and bromide concentrations at each sampling event for e85 plot fig 6 violin plots median values showed the faster dissolution of ethanol that peaked only 5 days after the release while bromide maximum dissolution occurred 83 days after the release since bromide and the gasohol blend were released together such differences reflect the higher aqueous solubility of ethanol relative to bromide in addition violin plots revealed a smoother variation of bromide shapes over time relative to the highly irregular ethanol distribution this can be attributed to the conservative behavior of bromide as opposed to the highly biodegradable ethanol a highly variable water table may enhance btex dissolution from the source or the free product zone fpz and the subsequent outcome would be a vertical downward migration of contaminants as the water table descends in gasohol spills the dissolved ethanol which floats on the top of an aquifer can remobilize retained btex in the vadose zone mcdowell et al 2003 falta 1998 this seems to be the case of the e85 source area as the high dissolved concentrations of btex coincided with the increase in water level and the intense recharge events fig 7 the contaminants ethanol and btex rapidly reached the water table moving vertically 1 3 m in one day fig 5 such fast migration was attributed to the root channels and other preferential transport pathways jarvis 2007 which along with the high solubility of ethanol facilitates the movement the high amount of ethanol could have also reduced the sorption of hydrocarbons contributing to the vertical transfer of btex as well da silva and alvarez 2002 during the initial water level increase between 5 and 6 days after the release the average concentration of btex in the aqueous phase increased about 10 times whereas after 20 days a pronounced rising of aquifer water table resulted in a pulse enhanced concentration up to three fold lastly between 42 and 83 days after the release average concentrations of btex doubled and maximum values per sampling event continued to increase because of the high hydraulic head of the aquifer fig 7 thus data confirmed a correlation between rainfall driven processes e g recharge water table variation and the increasing dissolved btex concentrations in the source zone table s3 supporting information the combined effects of ethanol and aquifer fluctuation must be carefully accounted in sites impacted by gasohol spills as they can accelerate dissolution process and may compromise remediation plans based on the slow transfer hypotheses of persistent lnapl sources that generally results in long lasting contaminations free phase product sample fps occurrences started 18 days after the release when the water table reached 2 25 m above sea level 0 7 m depth underneath the source underlining a correlation between aquifer oscillation and napl migration hence after 42 days dual phase samples collected at 3 m depth were dragged down with water table descent between 27 and 42 days in addition groundwater samples highlighted a remarkable lateral migration of napl probably due to the collapse of capillary fringe exerted by the high amount of ethanol twenty five fps were detected between 20 and 83 days after release in different wells mw f mw 2 mw 5 mw 7 mw 8 mw 10 and mw 11 if they were accounted within the source region in only 42 days the initial spill area increased from 1 5 m2 in the vadose zone to at least 5 6 m2 of fpz on the top of saturated zone these findings suggest that high ethanol content blends can lead to the fast napl mobilization due to ethanol driven cosolvency and collapse of capillary fringe resulting in large and irregular fpzs however despite the complexity of fpz dissolved ethanol btex compounds in the e85 site exhibited a comparable plume evolution figs 4 and 5 showing similar and uniform shapes which is consistent with yu et al 2009 observations therefore our data demonstrate that ethanol content or transiency of groundwater flow exerts a larger influence on dissolved plume behavior when compared to the geometry of the contamination source btex mass transfer in the e85 site was similar to an ethanol flushing of the source jawitz et al 2000 brooks et al 2004 to exemplify btex was readily transferred to the aqueous phase the peaks occurred between 40 and 85 days and exhibited low persistence reaching concentrations 7 μg l 1 close to remediation goals within 1600 days after release comparatively such low source zone concentrations were observed at the e24 site only after 5000 days following the release although the highly soluble ethanol generally dissolves earlier than btex corseuil et al 2011a as a result of the limited aqueous solubility of the aromatic compounds the breakthrough curves btc in e85 plot showed peak concentrations of both ethanol and btex at the beginning of the experiment as compounds migrated away from the source peak concentrations of ethanol and btex were concomitantly detected in the mws located in the main groundwater flow direction demonstrating their concurrent dissolution and migration fig 8 likewise centroid locations also indicated a pronounced migration of ethanol and btex plumes in e85 site fig 4 fig 5 which is coherent with compounds enhanced dissolution exerted by the site hydraulic effects and the high ethanol content of the gasohol blend the decrease in ethanol and btex concentrations was accompanied by the production of their anaerobic metabolites acetate and methane thus providing evidence of ethanol and btex biodegradation fig 8c d the flow field characteristics can predict the migration of dissolved contaminants plumes and thereby support the decision on the most appropriate monitoring strategy contaminants concentration per sampling level indicated a sinking process of the dissolved compounds in the e85 the source zone wells revealed high contaminants concentration at the upper level 2 m bgs whereas at distant monitoring wells mw 23 and mw 28 located at 10 and 14 m away from the source respectively contaminants concentrated on the deeper levels 5 and 6 m bgs likewise as previously mentioned in section 3 1 the same phenomenon was observed for the e24 site although it was less pronounced the vertical drift is directly associated with the local flow field that contributes to a downward movement of the compounds in addition a plume inspection along a transect located 14 m away from the source shows the highest concentrations at 4 m bgs from the western boundary mw 27 in fig 9a and 6 m bgs from the eastern boundary mw 31 in fig 9c this nonhomogeneous distribution of concentrations is probably caused by a low permeability formation dipped towards the east that corroborates the anti clockwise rotation of the main groundwater direction during dry periods supporting information such changes in plume direction could be predicted with a time series analysis of the flow field at contaminated sites this underscores the importance of conducting a thorough hydrogeological assessment to properly select groundwater monitoring wells and track contaminants plume migration 3 3 ethanol and btex degradation kinetics the faster dissolution of btex observed in the e85 site relative to e24 was attributed to the higher amount of ethanol that exerted cosolvency effect fig 3 accordingly both btex and ethanol mass peaked at 85 days after the release fig 11 thus demonstrating a similar dissolution dynamics degradation rates were determined after the onset of ethanol and btex biodegradation and as they peaked concomitantly similar initial timeframes were considered in the calculations table 2 unlike e85 in the e24 site btex concentrations peaked after 970 days and the onset of their biodegradation was observed only after ethanol depletion fig 11 it is worth noting that control experiments with gasoline alone would be useful to quantitatively discern the effects of ethanol the conservative tracer bromide zero order mass decrease was used to represent migration of dissolved compounds forced by groundwater flow field at both experimental sites and to estimate transport rates results revealed a transport rate three times higher in e85 0 242 y 1 than e24 0 092 y 1 table 3 which coincided with the flow field analysis section 3 1 this difference in mass decrease transport related follows the ratio of seepage velocities between the sites which can potentially avoid confounding effects in the estimation of contaminants biodegradation rates since the area with faster flow e85 also presented higher fitted decay rates it worth stressing that fitted mass degradation values for ethanol and btex table 2 agreed with results reported by other studies that used different methodologies corseuil et al 2011a corseuil et al 2015 ramos et al 2016 steiner et al 2018 after subtracting specific transport rates from the reactive compounds degradation the resulting first order biodegradation rates were ethanol 1 104 y 1 e85 and 1 076 y 1 e24 benzene 0 836 y 1 e85 and 0 674 y 1 e24 and in average for total btex 0 816 y 1 e85 and 0 401 y 1 e24 table 2 these values are consistent with the range of rates reported elsewhere for ethanol and btex compounds alvarez et al 1991 corseuil et al 1998 therefore the enhanced dissolution of btex in e85 site led to higher biodegradation rates relative to btex in e24 site the higher btex biodegradation rates in e85 relative to e24 site could be attributed to the metabolic flux dilution phenomenon as it predicts that removal rates are proportional to the fraction of the available substrates in the mixture lovanh and alvarez 2004 accordingly the metabolic flux dilution in e85 was evaluated at the source zone mw 11 and compared with source zone sw4 at e24 site corseuil et al 2015 the enhanced dissolution and availability of btex in e85 site increased their source zone fraction in the mixture ethanol btex as opposed to the lower dissolved btex concentrations and corresponding fraction in the mixture in e24 site fig 10 therefore higher biodegradation rates were observed for btex in e85 site which was likely due to their enhanced fraction in the mixture relative to e24 site this is consistent with metabolic flux dilution that considers the simultaneous degradation of multiple substrates with compound specific degradation rates being proportional to their relative abundance in the mixture the higher removal rates observed for the e85 site are coherent with the stimulation of biomass and specific hydrocarbon degraders accordingly after 72 days following the release total biomass growth increased up to 2 orders of magnitude 2 5 109 gene copies g 1 relative to the background concentration at the source zone 3 107 gene copies g 1 this is consistent with the organic compounds infiltration and dissolution into the groundwater as they were likely used as substrates for microbial growth the migration of dissolved contaminants away from the source figs 12 and 13 was reflected by the decrease in total biomass source zone concentration at 918 days after the release reaching a condition similar to the background 2 9 107 gene copies g 1 that was observed until the end of the monitoring period 4 5 107 gene copies g 1 at 1532 days after e85 release fig 12 thus although contaminants were partly consumed as substrates the transport was likely the driving force as evidenced by the plume migration over the site which justifies the return towards the original unpolluted state baseline microbial condition at the source zone likewise sequencing results revealed the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons degraders gouta 19 treponema wchb1 05 kaistobacter geobacter rhodoplanes sphingomonas at the monitoring wells evaluated mw s mw 23 and mw 25 fig 13a and b which is coherent with their exposure to btex compounds anaerobic genera dominated wells mw 23 and mw 25 which was likely due to the presence of residual concentrations of btex 132 and 241 μg l 1 that generally depletes the available dissolved oxygen and leads to the establishment of anaerobic zones as evidenced by the negative orp values 36 and 1 mv and methane production 8 5 and 4 mg l 1 comparatively the source zone microbial profile at 1532 days was mainly composed by aerobic genera which can be supported by the absence of btex compounds at the source after 1532 days the positive orp value 222 mv and methane concentration below the detection limit 10 μg l 1 detailed information about the metabolism and respiration mode of the microbial genera detected in e85 site is available in the supporting information table s4 these findings provide converging lines of evidence of btex migration over the site and biodegradation thus indicating that molecular biology can be used as a complementary tool for groundwater pollution monitoring as communities shift according to the transient flow and geochemical conditions encountered at the site 4 conclusions spills of gasohol blends into phreatic aquifers subject to high recharge rates and sharp water table fluctuations can undergo enhanced migration and degradation transient variations in groundwater flow velocity and direction caused by the changes in recharge as well as geological heterogeneity can enhance source dissolution resulting in greater plume spreading and migration this has significant implications for effective monitoring of groundwater pollutants and plume dynamics and lifespan in controlled gasohol spills at ressacada brazil the sharp water table fluctuations observed in e85 site dragged the compounds downwards showing a fast vertical migration while this effect was less pronounced in e24 site due to the lower hydraulic conductivity and the position of low conductivity layers specific migration of bromide plumes showed significant differences in transport rates between the e85 faster and e24 slower sites despite the fact that both sites are located at neighboring areas 400 m of distance the higher seepage velocity in e85 relative to e24 resulted in a faster horizontal migration of plume center of mass 15 and 5 m for e85 and e24 respectively which underscores the critical influence of local flow field in contaminated sites assessment and the importance of subtracting flow driven rates from the decay rates obtained by fitting field data to isolate biodegradation rates the high amount of ethanol in e85 site exerted cosolvency effect on btex and thereby enhanced their dissolution within 85 days and average concentrations up to 20 mgl 1 in groundwater the high concentrations of btex led to faster degradation rates relative to e24 site and btex and ethanol were biodegraded concomitantly as opposed to the often observed ethanol preferential biodegradation this was likely attributed to the metabolic flux dilution phenomenon as the relative biodegradability of a compound in a mixture of alternative substrates is often concentration dependent and the degradation rates are proportional to their fraction in the substrates mixture therefore btex and ethanol were biodegraded at similar rates comparatively in e24 site btex dissolution was significantly slower maximum after 1000 days and the onset of btex dissolution and biodegradation was only observed after ethanol depletion accordingly btex degradation rates were slower 0 401 y 1 relative to 0 816 y 1 and mass depletion was delayed after 3800 days relative to 1600 days following the release relative to e85 site total biomass was stimulated as ethanol and btex dissolved into the groundwater and shifts in microbial communities were driven by the transient flow and geochemical groundwater conditions at the e85 site thus although the high amount of ethanol in e85 site enhanced btex dissolution it led to fast degradation rates that speeded up btex compounds biodegradation while their migration was determined by the local groundwater flow overall the practical implication of this work is that the groundwater flow field and high ethanol content in gasohol blends can significantly affect plume dynamics and lifespan especially at sites under high recharge rates or fast groundwater flow accordingly e85 site due to a faster groundwater flow showed an increased migration of contaminants relative to e24 2 6 times higher but also exhibited higher biodegradation rates 2 0 times higher whilst e24 demonstrated a lower plume mobility and longer lasting contamination due to the reduced biodegradation rates relative to e85 these factors must be carefully accounted to estimate the risk for downgradient receptors and to support decisions on monitoring plans and remedial actions simplified approaches that

1594,the spatial markov model smm is an upscaled model with a strong track record in predicting upscaled behavior of conservative solute transport across hydrologic systems here we propose an smm that can account for reactive linear adsorption and desorption processes and test it on a simple benchmark problem flow and transport through an idealized periodic wavy channel the methodology is built using trajectories that are obtained from a single high resolution random walk simulation of conservative transport across one periodic element our approach encodes information about where a particle starts at the inlet where it leaves at the outlet how long it takes to cross the domain and one additional piece of information the number of times a particle strikes the boundary with the objective of predicting large scale transport with arbitrary linear adsorption and desorption rates our benchmark problem demonstrates that predictions made with our proposed smm agree favorably with results from direct numerical simulations which resolve the full transport problem keywords sorption desorption upscaling spatial markov model 1 introduction transport of chemical species through porous media can be complex relative to the flow through the medium due to the fact that constituents can sorb and desorb to the solid matrix thus slowing down their movement relative to the flow a common textbook approach to account for this is the inclusion of a retardation coefficient in an advection dispersion equation ade bear 2013 this is only valid when i assumptions required to derive the ade for conservative transport hold and ii when one can assume that solute in the fluid and solid phases is in an instantaneous well mixed equilibrium for complex porous media where geometries can give rise to heterogeneous flows comprised of fast preferential flow channels as well as slower trapping regions such assumptions can be questionable even for conservative transport where there is no mass exchange between the fluid and the solid phase anomalous non fickian transport is known to occur particularly at early preasymptotic times e g salles et al 1992 lester et al 2014 the problem is further complicated with the addition of potentially complex kinetic surface sorption and desorption processes which introduce their own set of potentially vastly different time scales maghrebi et al 2014 2015 in many instances it is not of interest to explicitly describe and resolve all details of transport at all scales but rather model them effectively at some scale of particular interest representing the transport of a solute in a complex flow with a one dimensional upscaled description can be dated back to upscaling transport in cylindrical tubes by gi taylor and aris taylor 1953 aris 1956 this was later generalized to more complex flow configurations using a variety of related methods e g brenner 1980 plumb whitaker 1988 hornung 1997 in all cases longitudinal transport can be described with an effective one dimensional ade with an enhanced fickian dispersion coefficient that reflects spreading due to subscale variations in velocities these models have been generalized to include a wide variety of reactive processes including surface reactions and mixing processes e g shapiro brenner 1988 dykaar kitanidis 1996 bolster et al 2011 dykaar kitanidis 1996 calculated effective dispersion velocity and reaction rates in an idealized pore geometry by considering flow and transport in a periodic channel with sinusoidal boundaries where solute can react and degrade close to the boundaries a process that is mathematically similar to sorption levesque et al 2012 generalized taylor dispersion to systems that include adsorption and desorption to and from solid boundaries in the flow domain and applied it to benchmark poiseuille flows in planar and cylindrical geometries both in constant and periodic time varying flows in all cases effective velocities and dispersion coefficients can vary significantly when compared to values obtained for a conservative solute these coefficients may also vary dynamically in time as recently shown in zhang et al 2017 the above methods in their original form hinge on the assumption that sufficient time has passed for the solute to sample the full variability of flow velocities under displacements induced by diffusion this is characterized by the taylor dispersion time scale τ d l 2 d where l is a characteristic length scale and d the diffusion coefficient at times smaller than this the aforementioned models are strictly speaking not valid in the presence of reactions the relative magnitude of reaction and transport characteristic time scales becomes relevant to the applicability of continuum scale models such as the standard advection dispersion reaction equation e g battiato et al 2009 battiato tartakovsky 2011 depending on the nature of the problem at hand this may or may not be important for example many observations of so called anomalous or non fickian transport e g rehfeldt et al 1992 harvey gorelick 2000 cortis berkowitz 2004 are situations where all length and velocity scales of the system have not yet been sampled and where the largest time scale might be tremendously large relative to times of practical interest e g dentz et al 2004 zhang et al 2007 it is possible to relax this assumption and develop similar theories that are valid at pre asymptotic times e g richmond et al 2013 porter et al 2010 porta et al 2016 but these still come with strong assumptions that may or may not be met a strong benefit of these models is that they can help yield great physical insight into important processes at small scales that dominate large scale behaviors however in some instances the resulting models can be highly complex integro differential equations with strong memory effects meaning that solving them can be as burdensome as solving the full microscale problem e g davit et al 2012 porta et al 2016 the spatial markov model smm first introduced by le borgne et al 2008a provides an alternative relatively parsimonious approach that can be applied at preasymptotic times significantly earlier than taylor dispersion sund et al 2016 the smm falls into the broad family of continuous time random walk ctrw models berkowitz et al 2006 in the smm a solute plume is represented as a large number of infinitesimal particles that transition through space and time most often spatial increments are fixed and temporal increments are random sampled from a measured transition time distribution this is common to many ctrw models what sets the smm apart is that successive temporal increments can be explicitly correlated reflecting underlying persistence of fast particles to move quickly and slow particles to move slowly which is particularly important in systems that are advection dominated bolster et al 2014 the smm has had success in upscaling transport across a diverse set of transport settings including highly heterogeneous darcy scale porous media le borgne et al 2008a le borgne et al 2008b fracture networks kang et al 2011 pore scale systems le borgne et al 2011 de anna et al 2013 bolster et al 2014 kang et al 2014 unsteady flows through porous media sund et al 2015a and a field scale application to a fractured aquifer kang et al 2015 the model has recently been extended to incorporate nonlinear features such as mixing and reactions sund et al 2015b sund et al 2017a 2017b in the above examples the flows are typically either highly heterogeneous with some random structure or non uniform but with a periodic unit cell as commonly used in classical upscaling approaches such as volume averaging plumb whitaker 1988 bahar et al 2018 the method of moments brenner 1980 or homogenization hornung 1997 boccardo et al 2018a one of the criticisms of the smm is that it can require extensive parameterization and the most common approach to date is to track lagrangian particle statistics across two spatial increments measuring particles transition times across each and representing the correlation structure via a transition matrix simplified forms have emerged which assume an idealized structure to the transition matrix and have shown success kang et al 2015 kang et al 2016 but the assumed structure may not be sufficiently general to be universal more recently an approach was developed that takes successive breakthrough curves and infers the transition matrix structure through an inverse modeling approach sherman et al 2017 this was later applied to laboratory scale data of transport through zeolite packed columns sherman et al 2018 all of these approaches require information about travel times across two spatial intervals within a domain composed of periodic cells sund et al 2017b developed an approach that only requires travel statistics across one cell by parameterizing the model in terms of trajectories rather than just travel times alone thus with one high resolution simulation across one cell corresponding to one spatial increment in the smm they were able to efficiently and rapidly predict large scale transport and mixing across much greater extents with the upscaled model running on the order of 1000 times faster than a fully resolved one the work of sund et al 2017b was only performed in the context of conservative transport here we extend this approach to account for linear adsorption and desorption processes in particular our goal is to only use trajectory statistics from conservative non sorbing transport across a single periodic cell to predict larger scale transport of a solute that can adsorb and desorb to the solid matrix with arbitrary adsorption and desorption rates that is we only need one high resolution simulation across one periodic element with which to ultimately predict a broad and extensive range of possible transport scenarios across large scales this extension to sorbing solutes opens the pathways towards the application of this methods to a broad class of reactive transport problems such as contaminant transport in aquifers rathi et al 2017 as well as flow through membranes and packed bed reactors iliev et al 2017 da luz et al 2018 in this work we showcase our modeling procedure by relying on a relatively simple flow geometry the simplicity of the geometry allows for a clear understanding of emergent behaviors which can then be related to observations in more complex settings thus we regard it as an ideal starting point for our current extension of the smm moreover a simple geometrical setting can provide critical information with which to parameterize pore network models and therefore help bridge the gap between pore and continuum scale e g seetha et al 2014 2 model system 2 1 pore scale setting fig 1 displays the geometry used in this study a converging diverging channel filled with fluid whose solid boundaries are defined by 1 h x h h sin 2 πx l π 2 where x is the horizontal coordinate h x h and h are related to the width of the half aperture see fig 1 and l is the length of a single cell in this study to be consistent with previous ones e g sund et al 2017b sund et al 2015b we will focus on the specific values of h l 4 and h 0 8 h this setting was first used by dykaar kitanidis 1996 to upscale effective reaction rates in porous media using the method of moments while this geometry is very simple the emergent flow displays some of the complex features pertinent to understanding flow and transport in porous media including a fast preferential flow path and stagnant trapping areas which are known to strongly impact transport in real porous media e g edery et al 2014 this and very similar geometries have received extensive attention in the literature for example chaudhary et al 2013 chaudhary et al 2011 and bouquain et al 2012 bolster et al 2014 studied the effects of inertia on flow and transport respectively similarly others have looked at how geometry impacts asymptotic cardenas 2009 bolster et al 2009 and pre asymptotic transport cardenas 2008 le borgne et al 2012 as well as the role of turbulence on large scale dispersion richmond et al 2013 one of the reasons we choose this geometry is that under the assumption of stokes flow i e reynolds number less than o 1 a semi analytical solution exists kitanidis dykaar 1997 dykaar kitanidis 1996 the solution uses a perturbation method to solve the biharmonic equation which governs the streamline structure details of the solution as well as its validation are available in various papers kitanidis dykaar 1997 dykaar kitanidis 1996 cao kitanidis 1998 bolster et al 2009 and so are not elaborated on here the geometry defined above is chosen because of the interesting flow patterns including the emergence of a recirculation region and a fast central preferential flow channel while the geometry is highly idealized these specific features mimic features of interest in real porous media making this model potentially appealing due to the natural symmetry of the system throughout this entire work we only ever simulate the top half of the domain y 0 2 2 simulation of transport at the microscale solute transport with sorption and desorption is modeled by khan 1962 zhang et al 2017 2 c x t t u x c x t d c x t

coefficient taken to be constant in the fluid s x t ml 2 is the concentration on the surface λ t 1 is the rate of desorption α lt 1 is the rate of adsorption and n is the unit normal to the boundary note that the first equation in 2 describes transport in the main channel which is governed by the advection diffusion equation the second equation is the boundary condition describing exchange between the fluid and solid phase the rate of change of surface concentration is given by the rate at which solute concentration attaches to the boundary αc minus the rate which solid phase concentration is detaching λs for mass balance reasons this must be equal to the diffusive flux of solute concentration at the boundary d c n in all cases we consider an initial condition of an instantaneous line source flux weighted along the pore throat i e c x t 0 u x δ x this choice of initial condition is common as it is believed to mimic real experiments e g ptak teutsch 1994 morales et al 2017 and also represents the asymptotic distribution to which lagrangian particles are expected to converge e g dentz et al 2016 comolli dentz 2017 kang et al 2017 to solve this system we implement a numerical lagrangian particle based random walk method risken 1984 where the solute plume is discretized into a finite number of n particles we incorporate the sorption desorption boundaries following the work of boccardo et al 2018b during each step each particle is moved according to langevin equation 3 x i n 1 x i n u i δ t ξ i 2 d δ t y i n 1 y i n v i δ t η i 2 d δ t t i n 1 t i n δ t τ i i 1 n where x i n and y i n are the horizontal and vertical position of particle i respectively at simulation step n u i and v i are the x and y components of the velocity respectively ξ and η are independent and identically distributed iid gaussian variables with zero mean and unit variance δt is a fixed time step t i n is the time for particle i at simulation step n and τ i is a random waiting time 4 τ i t i p u i 0 p u i where the t i are iid exponential with density ψ τ λ exp λτ p is the probabilty of sorption and u i are iid u 0 1 uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 the solid boundaries in the domain are modeled as elastic reflection boundaries any time a particle reflects off a solid boundary it either sorbs with probability p resulting in selecting τ randomly from ψ τ or does not sorb resulting in τ 0 to the leading order this probability can be computed as 5 p α π δ t d for further details on this as well as higher order approximations please see boccardo et al 2018b this number p is compared to a random number u drawn from a standard uniform distribution if u p no sorption occurs and if u p the particle sorbs our choice of solving this system using this lagrangian random walk method is based on the following i it naturally aligns with building an smm which relies on lagrangian statistics ii for a periodic system like this one it is possible to simulate very extensive domains as a particle s velocity at any given time depends only on its local position relative to the periodic cell meaning that we do not need a prohibitively large eulerian mesh and iii for a sufficiently smooth velocity field such as this one it is known not to suffer from numerical dispersion which could be problematic since diffusion and adsorption processes are closely linked for all of the results that we present in this paper we used one million particles and a time step of δt 10 3 consistent with previous experience in the same domain bolster et al 2009 2 3 dimensionless numbers the system described in section 2 2 is characterized by the following dimensionless numbers 6 re h u ν pe h u d da a h α π d da d h 2 λ d u is the mean velocity and ν is the viscosity of the fluid re is the reynolds number which we have already assumed to be small re o 1 in using the prescribed flow field pe is the péclet number which reflects the competition between advection and diffusion processes and typically lies in the range 0 1 pe 103 dykaar kitanidis 1996 we will focus on the higher range of these values as it is known that advection dominated systems are more likely to violate assumptions inherent to taylor dispersion and classical advection disperison upscaling da a and da d are adsorptive and desorptive damköhler numbers which respectively compare the time scales associated with adsorptive and desorptive processes to diffusive ones in a batch system large values of these would correspond to systems close to equilibrium between surface and fluid concentrations in the following any reported dimensionless parameters are obtained by setting u 1 2 h 1 in arbitrary units and tuning d α and λ to obtain specified values of pe da a and da d 2 4 inputs for spatial markov model trajectories travel times and number of hits here we define the inputs that must be obtained from the microscale domain in order to build the macroscale effective smm described in the following section in all cases we obtain these inputs by running a random walk with a flux weighted pulse initial condition at the throat of a pore see fig 1 and simulate transport across one periodic unit cell this calibration simulation is for a conservative random walk that does not include sorption the periodic unit cell corresponds to the blown up region in fig 1 sund et al s 2017b smm is different from others in that it samples trajectories rather than travel times these trajectories are obtained by simulating transport across a single unit cell using 7 x i n 1 x i n u i δ t ξ i 2 d δ t y i n 1 y i n v i δ t η i 2 d δ t i 1 n this is a standard random walk framework note these equations are the same as 3 but without the random waiting times associated with modeling sorption using this we store specific information about each particle s trajectory in sund s approach each trajectory is defined by three parameters i its vertical position at the inlet of the periodic element y in ii the time t it takes to travel from the inlet to the outlet and iii its vertical position at the outlet when it leaves the periodic element y out in addition to these three inputs our method will account for adsorption desorption by storing one additional piece of information iv n hits the number of times a particle strikes a solid boundary when crossing a single cell we propose that by running one high resolution simulation of conservative transport over one periodic element we can obtain all of the required information needed to upscale and describe transport with adsorption and desorption efficiently over much larger scales however it must be noted that for each different value of pe a different calibration simulation is required 2 5 effective transport model the spatial markov model here we propose an smm which is an effective upscaled transport model that describes transport in one dimension aligned with the direction of flow the smm is a time domain random walk model and again the solute is represented by discrete particles whose motion in time and space is governed by 8 x i k 1 x i k l t i k 1 t i k t i k j 1 n hits k τ j tildes refer to upscaled quantities x i k is the horizontal location of particle i at the beginning of step k t i k is the time associated with particle i at the beginning of step k n hits k is the number of times the sampled trajectory strikes the boundary during step k during each step a particle transitions a constant longitudinal distance l the length of our periodic cell and it does so in a random time t which is sampled from a measured travel time distribution the discrete distribution obtained from the single pore calibration simulation in 7 t reflects the range of velocities that particles sample in traversing the unit cell the feature that makes the smm unique relative to other random walk models is that successive temporal increments are not independent of one another correlation arises when a particle that traverses one periodic unit quickly is also likely to traverse the next one quickly and likewise for a slow one in the absence of diffusion particles persist on the same streamline always and so successive jumps would have the same transition time due to diffusion particles can leave streamlines and sample various flow streamlines however when advective effects are strong relative to diffusive ones memory effects persist and must be accounted for through correlation in most applications correlations are applied using a transition matrix le borgne et al 2008a we apply here instead the trajectory based approach recently proposed in sund et al 2017b because the trajectory based method can account for the number of times each trajectory interacts with the boundary in a way that the original transition matrix approach cannot this approach naturally provides a framework that more readily characterizes interactions of particles with the reactive boundary using the information stored as inputs for the smm described in 2 4 it should be noted that the periodic nature of the domain is important in accomplishing this although some other recent studies suggest that trajectory based methods may also work for heterogeneous systems characterized by a stationary heterogeneity distribution wright et al 2019 most 2019 in this implementation of the model each step of length l is associated with a specific particle trajectory we summarize our algorithm in the following steps 1 each particle starts with a given y in reflecting the desired initial condition this sets a specific trajectory that has an associated travel time which is used as the time increment t i k in 8 and an assigned number of hits n hits k 2 adsorption is accounted for by the term j 1 n hits k τ j where each strike with the boundary adds a possible waiting time which is sampled from the same distribution ψ τ as used in 3 with probability p from 5 3 the model then samples the next trajectory randomly using y out as a conditioning criterion for picking the next trajectory by making sure that its y in is close to the previous y out this is done by discretizing the inlet into n bins equi sized bins we used cases with n bins 10 100 and 1000 in this study with no notable difference in results a particle s vertical y location determines which bin it is in thus y out k determines the bin from which the next trajectory is sampled a trajectory with y in k 1 is randomly and uniformly sampled from the same bin that y out k ends in this binning procedure ensures correlation effects are accurately imposed 2 6 observables to test model we will test the proposed smm by comparing its ability to predict downstream transport as measured by breakthrough curves btcs measured at multiple downstream locations these are x 5l 10l 25l and 50l testing the upscaled model against btcs at multiple downstream locations provides a more robust test of the model compared with focusing on only one location sometimes a model can match a single btc due to overparameterization but when the same model can consistently match observations over multiple scales it suggests that the underlying physics is being more faithfully captured thus to produce benchmark data against which to test the smm we run a series of high resolution random walk simulations using the fully resolved transport eq 3 that account for advection diffusion adsorption and desorption in all cases we use a flux weighted pulse initial condition and run single realization simulations with n 106 particles these results are the reference solution against which the upscaled model is tested 3 results 3 1 travel time distributions and number of hits fig 2 displays the empirical travel time distributions measured from simulations across a single periodic element for two cases pe 100 and pe 1000 the data used to plot these travel time distributions is from where temporal increments are sampled these two péclet numbers are chosen because in the case of purely conservative transport it has been shown that for pe 100 incorporating correlation effects is unimportant while for pe 1000 it is bolster et al 2014 these distributions were obtained by creating a histogram of arrival times and normalizing the bin size of the histogram grew logarithmically with larger τ also shown are the number of times a particle trajectory strikes the boundary during a given transition across a single cell most notably for both péclet numbers the vast majority approximately 99 of trajectories never actually strike the boundary and pass through the pore with no possibility of adsorption taking place however some trajectories can strike the boundary anywhere up to 200 times meaning that the likelihood of adsorption can be significant depending on the adsorption rate or the probability of attachment p for the lower péclet number case more trajectories strike the boundary than in the pe 1000 case which intuitively makes sense given that the surface reaction is diffusion driven the expected delay for a reactive particle that strikes the boundary n hits times is τ n hits p λ where the angled brackets denote the expected value finally fig 2 shows a scatter plot of each simulated trajectory s starting location at the inlet against the number of interactions with the boundary this figure clearly highlights that for the pe 1000 case a particle has to start near the boundary in order to have any chance of interacting with it a particle that starts on the centerline y 0 has nearly zero likelihood of interacting with the boundary and thus adsorbing for the pe 100 case the number of hits per trajectory is relatively independent of y in this suggests that accounting for correlation effects i e knowing a particle s starting location as it transitions through each pore may be less important for pe 100 than for pe 1000 as found in the conservative case bolster et al 2014 fig 3 displays the discrete transition probabilities that a particle has for a y out given a particular y in which is a measure of correlation note that this figure is an approximation of the copula density function defining correlation between travel times in consecutive steps massoudieh et al 2017 as has been seen in previous studies for pe 100 this matrix is relatively uniform while there is a stronger diagonal dominance for the pe 1000 case reflecting the fact that correlation effects become stronger as péclet number increases bolster et al 2014 3 2 comparison between dns and smm predicted breakthrough curves 3 2 1 limit of no sorption p 0 to begin we demonstrate the proposed smm s ability to upscale transport in the absence of any sorption at all plots comparing breakthrough curves at multiple downstream locations measured by dns and predicted with the smm are shown in fig 4 as in previous studies the agreement is excellent demonstrating the veracity of our proposed approach 3 3 limit of unit probability next we focus on another limiting case where the probability of sorption each time a particle strikes the boundary is unity p 1 meaning that every strike results in an adsorption event while this may not be an entirely physical condition by considering this extreme case we are testing our proposed procedure across a wide range of possible da a for pe 100 and pe 1000 the respective values are da a 316 and da a 103 the considered values of λ 0 1 and 1 correspond to da d 10 102 and da d 102 103 respectively results comparing dns measured breakthrough curves as well as smm predicted ones are shown in fig 5 additionally for context and to explicitly demonstrate the role of sorption breakthrough curves for the case of zero sorption as discussed in the previous section are also included again the agreement between dns and smm is excellent with the smm capturing all essential features displayed by the fully resolved simulations for the pe 100 case the rising limb of the two earlier breakthrough curves is similar for the cases with and without sorption this corresponds to fast moving particles following trajectories that never interact with the boundary the late time behavior and the further downstream breakthrough curves are very distinct with a strong separation between the case with and without sorption reflecting strong delays due to sorption for the pe 1000 case more particles persist at moving quickly and do not interact with the boundary thus the early arrivals are similar between cases with and without sorption again at late times there is a deviation between the cases with strong delays in the tails emerging for the cases with sorption 3 4 intermediate sorption results corresponding to a sorbing probability that is one order of magnitude smaller than in the previous section p 0 1 are shown in fig 6 which correspond to da a 31 6 and 100 the results demonstrate that the smm provides reliable results across the parameter space the resulting breakthrough curves reflect very similar behavior to the previous case however the tails are not as delayed reflecting the fact that only 10 of particles that sorbed in the p 1 case actually do so here for the pe 1000 and da d 1000 case λ 1 fig 6 top right it is visually next to impossible to see differences at late times while for the longer waiting time da d 100 λ 0 1 fig 6 bottom right a more distinct delayed tailing behavior emerges for the cases with sorption note that breakthrough curves obtained with p 0 1 λ 0 1 bottom row in fig 5 are identical to the ones for p 1 λ 1 case top row in fig 4 because their expected delay times are equivalent this is because on average multiplying both p and λ by a constant has no effect on average travel times 3 5 the role of correlation in this section we test how important including correlation in the smm is for accurately predicting downstream reactive transport behavior to do so an uncorrelated one dimensional time domain random walk tdrw model is built by simply sampling random trajectories without considering the inlet and outlet locations which are the quantities by which we enforce correlation in our model the trajectories are sampled uniformly from the calibration simulation data fig 7 shows the comparisons for all parameter choices considered so far but focusing only the furthest downstream btc x 50l as expected the importance of correlation effects is stronger for the pe 1000 cases than for pe 100 however even for pe 100 distinguishable errors are visible where successive travel times are sampled independently this suggests that while correlation effects are seemingly unimportant for the pe 100 case for conservative transport bolster et al 2014 as sorption at the boundary occurs correlation begins to play some role similar to what has been observed for reactions sund et al 2015b notably when correlation is not accounted for predicted breakthrough curves fail to capture the full rising limbs and also display greater delays than the actual measured ones this reflects the fact that too many particles are interacting with the boundary the uncorrelated model cannot account for the fact that fast particles have a tendency to persist at staying fast as well as the fact that the fastest particles have virtually no probability of getting sorbed as shown in fig 2 while well known that correlation plays an ever more important role as the péclet number of a system increases the effect of boundary reactions on the importance of correlations between successive jumps has not been previously explored fig 8 quantifies this effect based on the approximation of particle arrival times more specifically we consider the recovered mass at time t 9 m t 0 t c x 50 l t d t which is the cumulative distribution function of solute arrival times at x 50l we compute the mean absolute error mae i 1 n t m dns t i m simulated t i between the results obtained via dns and the upscaled simulation with uncorrelated steps at location 50l our results in agreement with previous studies show that the uncorrelated model can yield accurate arrival times of a nonreactive solute da a 0 for pe 100 as the mae attains a value of 5 10 5 the occurrence of adsorption induces an increase of the mae by approximately two orders of magnitude irrespective of the probability with which reaction occurs this is likely because only slower particles ever interact with the boundary and while weak some correlation does occur this does not mean that the model is not sensitive to p indeed it must be since larger values of p result in larger delays it is only saying that correlation effects may be more important to include in the upscaled model when sorption occurs note that when correlation is included the mae is approximately constant for all adsorption probabilities including the conservative case p 0 and attains a value of approximately 10 5 not shown additionally to provide another basis for comparison table 1 shows the arrival times when 1 50 and 99 of the mass has arrived for all of the cases shown in fig 7 we show the dimensionless time for dns and the relative difference r δ between dns and the two models computed as 10 r δ mod t pc mod t pc dns t pc dns where mod stands for unc uncorrelated tdrw or smm and t pc indicates the time corresponding to arrivals of percentile pc of total mass i e pc equals 1 50 and 99 here these results clearly and quantitatively highlight the good agreement between the dns and smm as well as the aforementioned discrepancies between the dns and uncorrelated tdrw model differences between dns and smm are always within 1 showing the robustness of the method on the other hand when correlations are neglected the errors increase sharply with pe i e relative differences between uncorrelated model and dns are up to 10 15 for pe 100 and up to 90 for pe 1000 in general the uncorrelated tdrw overestimates early arrivals and underestimates late arrivals correlation effects also appear to have different influence depending on da a and da d these differences emerge in the 1 and 50 arrival times early arrivals and median time although with relatively smaller variations than the ones observed for pe for early arrivals and median time the uncorrelated model errors tend to increase for increasing da a and decrease with increasing da d i e the error may change up to a factor 2 when the two damköhler numbers change by one order of magnitude 4 discussion and conclusions we have extended the spatial markov model for periodic flow domains proposed in sund et al 2017b to account for linear adsorption to and desorption from solid boundaries in particular we have built the framework based on a trajectory based smm where high resolution trajectories simulated by an advective diffusive random walk over a single periodic flow element are stitched together sequentially to predict transport over much larger scales in this novel approach we merely store one additional piece of information about each trajectory that is the number of times that it strikes a solid boundary this information reflects the solute flux close to the boundary surface that corresponds to the adsorption reaction rate coupling this with a probabilistic representation of sorption boccardo et al 2018b we can effectively upscale transport to represent arbitrary adsorption and desorption rates thus from a single high resolution random walk simulation of conservative transport across one periodic element we can model an extremely diverse range of adsorption desorption behaviors without the need to run further high resolution computationally intensive small scale simulations for each desired case of course this current application is strictly restricted to the example of an idealized periodic setting and it remains to be shown how generalizable it is to more complex and realistic settings as in previous studies of conservative transport the need for the upscaled model to account for correlation between successive jumps depends on the péclet number of the system with correlation being more important as advection begins to dominate more and more similarly it appears that the damköhler numbers play a role in determining how important correlation is merely delineating regions where correlation is important or unimportant for conservative transport does not provide a sufficient condition for the case when reaction occurs this is particularly relevant for the accurate representation of early and late particle arrivals with the upscaled model because these are most sensitive to correlation effects fast particles tend to persist as fast and slow as slow for the conditions explored we have numerically verified that the correlation between subsequent travel times plays a relevant role across the full range of investigated adsorption rates as expected the relevance of correlation is sharply influenced by pe but also increases with da a fast adsorption and decreases with da d fast desorption this trend is particularly striking for early arrivals which could be of practical relevance e g in assessment of membranes life cycle or of risk with contaminant breakthrough in aquifers notably our approach conserves the same accuracy with respect to fully resolved simulations for both conservative and reactive transport our model can accurately upscale kinetic sorption and desorption processes i e it does not assume equilibrium between sorbed and dissolved solute mass as would be the case if modeling adsorption desorption with a retardation coefficient we emphasize that the traditional use of a retardation factor to account for the delays in transport induced by adsorption and desorption will not work to reproduce the cases that we simulate here the main effect of a retardation coefficient would simply be a rescaling in time of a conservative concentration profile or breakthrough curve however the breakthrough curves obtained in this study in many cases have a fundamentally different shape from those without adsorption and desorption the use of a retardation coefficient assumes an instantaneous equilibrium between mobile and immobile parts of the domain and clearly that is not the case here particularly for the higher péclet number case the persistence of correlation effects is very much inline with the fact that highly mobile particles traveling on fast trajectories have virtually no interaction with the boundaries while slower ones can have many reflecting a lack of equilibrium as with upscaling of other transport processes at late times as systems begin to homogenize i e greater than taylor time scales conditions for such an equilibrium can arise but this may or may not be useful depending on

1594,the spatial markov model smm is an upscaled model with a strong track record in predicting upscaled behavior of conservative solute transport across hydrologic systems here we propose an smm that can account for reactive linear adsorption and desorption processes and test it on a simple benchmark problem flow and transport through an idealized periodic wavy channel the methodology is built using trajectories that are obtained from a single high resolution random walk simulation of conservative transport across one periodic element our approach encodes information about where a particle starts at the inlet where it leaves at the outlet how long it takes to cross the domain and one additional piece of information the number of times a particle strikes the boundary with the objective of predicting large scale transport with arbitrary linear adsorption and desorption rates our benchmark problem demonstrates that predictions made with our proposed smm agree favorably with results from direct numerical simulations which resolve the full transport problem keywords sorption desorption upscaling spatial markov model 1 introduction transport of chemical species through porous media can be complex relative to the flow through the medium due to the fact that constituents can sorb and desorb to the solid matrix thus slowing down their movement relative to the flow a common textbook approach to account for this is the inclusion of a retardation coefficient in an advection dispersion equation ade bear 2013 this is only valid when i assumptions required to derive the ade for conservative transport hold and ii when one can assume that solute in the fluid and solid phases is in an instantaneous well mixed equilibrium for complex porous media where geometries can give rise to heterogeneous flows comprised of fast preferential flow channels as well as slower trapping regions such assumptions can be questionable even for conservative transport where there is no mass exchange between the fluid and the solid phase anomalous non fickian transport is known to occur particularly at early preasymptotic times e g salles et al 1992 lester et al 2014 the problem is further complicated with the addition of potentially complex kinetic surface sorption and desorption processes which introduce their own set of potentially vastly different time scales maghrebi et al 2014 2015 in many instances it is not of interest to explicitly describe and resolve all details of transport at all scales but rather model them effectively at some scale of particular interest representing the transport of a solute in a complex flow with a one dimensional upscaled description can be dated back to upscaling transport in cylindrical tubes by gi taylor and aris taylor 1953 aris 1956 this was later generalized to more complex flow configurations using a variety of related methods e g brenner 1980 plumb whitaker 1988 hornung 1997 in all cases longitudinal transport can be described with an effective one dimensional ade with an enhanced fickian dispersion coefficient that reflects spreading due to subscale variations in velocities these models have been generalized to include a wide variety of reactive processes including surface reactions and mixing processes e g shapiro brenner 1988 dykaar kitanidis 1996 bolster et al 2011 dykaar kitanidis 1996 calculated effective dispersion velocity and reaction rates in an idealized pore geometry by considering flow and transport in a periodic channel with sinusoidal boundaries where solute can react and degrade close to the boundaries a process that is mathematically similar to sorption levesque et al 2012 generalized taylor dispersion to systems that include adsorption and desorption to and from solid boundaries in the flow domain and applied it to benchmark poiseuille flows in planar and cylindrical geometries both in constant and periodic time varying flows in all cases effective velocities and dispersion coefficients can vary significantly when compared to values obtained for a conservative solute these coefficients may also vary dynamically in time as recently shown in zhang et al 2017 the above methods in their original form hinge on the assumption that sufficient time has passed for the solute to sample the full variability of flow velocities under displacements induced by diffusion this is characterized by the taylor dispersion time scale τ d l 2 d where l is a characteristic length scale and d the diffusion coefficient at times smaller than this the aforementioned models are strictly speaking not valid in the presence of reactions the relative magnitude of reaction and transport characteristic time scales becomes relevant to the applicability of continuum scale models such as the standard advection dispersion reaction equation e g battiato et al 2009 battiato tartakovsky 2011 depending on the nature of the problem at hand this may or may not be important for example many observations of so called anomalous or non fickian transport e g rehfeldt et al 1992 harvey gorelick 2000 cortis berkowitz 2004 are situations where all length and velocity scales of the system have not yet been sampled and where the largest time scale might be tremendously large relative to times of practical interest e g dentz et al 2004 zhang et al 2007 it is possible to relax this assumption and develop similar theories that are valid at pre asymptotic times e g richmond et al 2013 porter et al 2010 porta et al 2016 but these still come with strong assumptions that may or may not be met a strong benefit of these models is that they can help yield great physical insight into important processes at small scales that dominate large scale behaviors however in some instances the resulting models can be highly complex integro differential equations with strong memory effects meaning that solving them can be as burdensome as solving the full microscale problem e g davit et al 2012 porta et al 2016 the spatial markov model smm first introduced by le borgne et al 2008a provides an alternative relatively parsimonious approach that can be applied at preasymptotic times significantly earlier than taylor dispersion sund et al 2016 the smm falls into the broad family of continuous time random walk ctrw models berkowitz et al 2006 in the smm a solute plume is represented as a large number of infinitesimal particles that transition through space and time most often spatial increments are fixed and temporal increments are random sampled from a measured transition time distribution this is common to many ctrw models what sets the smm apart is that successive temporal increments can be explicitly correlated reflecting underlying persistence of fast particles to move quickly and slow particles to move slowly which is particularly important in systems that are advection dominated bolster et al 2014 the smm has had success in upscaling transport across a diverse set of transport settings including highly heterogeneous darcy scale porous media le borgne et al 2008a le borgne et al 2008b fracture networks kang et al 2011 pore scale systems le borgne et al 2011 de anna et al 2013 bolster et al 2014 kang et al 2014 unsteady flows through porous media sund et al 2015a and a field scale application to a fractured aquifer kang et al 2015 the model has recently been extended to incorporate nonlinear features such as mixing and reactions sund et al 2015b sund et al 2017a 2017b in the above examples the flows are typically either highly heterogeneous with some random structure or non uniform but with a periodic unit cell as commonly used in classical upscaling approaches such as volume averaging plumb whitaker 1988 bahar et al 2018 the method of moments brenner 1980 or homogenization hornung 1997 boccardo et al 2018a one of the criticisms of the smm is that it can require extensive parameterization and the most common approach to date is to track lagrangian particle statistics across two spatial increments measuring particles transition times across each and representing the correlation structure via a transition matrix simplified forms have emerged which assume an idealized structure to the transition matrix and have shown success kang et al 2015 kang et al 2016 but the assumed structure may not be sufficiently general to be universal more recently an approach was developed that takes successive breakthrough curves and infers the transition matrix structure through an inverse modeling approach sherman et al 2017 this was later applied to laboratory scale data of transport through zeolite packed columns sherman et al 2018 all of these approaches require information about travel times across two spatial intervals within a domain composed of periodic cells sund et al 2017b developed an approach that only requires travel statistics across one cell by parameterizing the model in terms of trajectories rather than just travel times alone thus with one high resolution simulation across one cell corresponding to one spatial increment in the smm they were able to efficiently and rapidly predict large scale transport and mixing across much greater extents with the upscaled model running on the order of 1000 times faster than a fully resolved one the work of sund et al 2017b was only performed in the context of conservative transport here we extend this approach to account for linear adsorption and desorption processes in particular our goal is to only use trajectory statistics from conservative non sorbing transport across a single periodic cell to predict larger scale transport of a solute that can adsorb and desorb to the solid matrix with arbitrary adsorption and desorption rates that is we only need one high resolution simulation across one periodic element with which to ultimately predict a broad and extensive range of possible transport scenarios across large scales this extension to sorbing solutes opens the pathways towards the application of this methods to a broad class of reactive transport problems such as contaminant transport in aquifers rathi et al 2017 as well as flow through membranes and packed bed reactors iliev et al 2017 da luz et al 2018 in this work we showcase our modeling procedure by relying on a relatively simple flow geometry the simplicity of the geometry allows for a clear understanding of emergent behaviors which can then be related to observations in more complex settings thus we regard it as an ideal starting point for our current extension of the smm moreover a simple geometrical setting can provide critical information with which to parameterize pore network models and therefore help bridge the gap between pore and continuum scale e g seetha et al 2014 2 model system 2 1 pore scale setting fig 1 displays the geometry used in this study a converging diverging channel filled with fluid whose solid boundaries are defined by 1 h x h h sin 2 πx l π 2 where x is the horizontal coordinate h x h and h are related to the width of the half aperture see fig 1 and l is the length of a single cell in this study to be consistent with previous ones e g sund et al 2017b sund et al 2015b we will focus on the specific values of h l 4 and h 0 8 h this setting was first used by dykaar kitanidis 1996 to upscale effective reaction rates in porous media using the method of moments while this geometry is very simple the emergent flow displays some of the complex features pertinent to understanding flow and transport in porous media including a fast preferential flow path and stagnant trapping areas which are known to strongly impact transport in real porous media e g edery et al 2014 this and very similar geometries have received extensive attention in the literature for example chaudhary et al 2013 chaudhary et al 2011 and bouquain et al 2012 bolster et al 2014 studied the effects of inertia on flow and transport respectively similarly others have looked at how geometry impacts asymptotic cardenas 2009 bolster et al 2009 and pre asymptotic transport cardenas 2008 le borgne et al 2012 as well as the role of turbulence on large scale dispersion richmond et al 2013 one of the reasons we choose this geometry is that under the assumption of stokes flow i e reynolds number less than o 1 a semi analytical solution exists kitanidis dykaar 1997 dykaar kitanidis 1996 the solution uses a perturbation method to solve the biharmonic equation which governs the streamline structure details of the solution as well as its validation are available in various papers kitanidis dykaar 1997 dykaar kitanidis 1996 cao kitanidis 1998 bolster et al 2009 and so are not elaborated on here the geometry defined above is chosen because of the interesting flow patterns including the emergence of a recirculation region and a fast central preferential flow channel while the geometry is highly idealized these specific features mimic features of interest in real porous media making this model potentially appealing due to the natural symmetry of the system throughout this entire work we only ever simulate the top half of the domain y 0 2 2 simulation of transport at the microscale solute transport with sorption and desorption is modeled by khan 1962 zhang et al 2017 2 c x t t u x c x t d c x t

coefficient taken to be constant in the fluid s x t ml 2 is the concentration on the surface λ t 1 is the rate of desorption α lt 1 is the rate of adsorption and n is the unit normal to the boundary note that the first equation in 2 describes transport in the main channel which is governed by the advection diffusion equation the second equation is the boundary condition describing exchange between the fluid and solid phase the rate of change of surface concentration is given by the rate at which solute concentration attaches to the boundary αc minus the rate which solid phase concentration is detaching λs for mass balance reasons this must be equal to the diffusive flux of solute concentration at the boundary d c n in all cases we consider an initial condition of an instantaneous line source flux weighted along the pore throat i e c x t 0 u x δ x this choice of initial condition is common as it is believed to mimic real experiments e g ptak teutsch 1994 morales et al 2017 and also represents the asymptotic distribution to which lagrangian particles are expected to converge e g dentz et al 2016 comolli dentz 2017 kang et al 2017 to solve this system we implement a numerical lagrangian particle based random walk method risken 1984 where the solute plume is discretized into a finite number of n particles we incorporate the sorption desorption boundaries following the work of boccardo et al 2018b during each step each particle is moved according to langevin equation 3 x i n 1 x i n u i δ t ξ i 2 d δ t y i n 1 y i n v i δ t η i 2 d δ t t i n 1 t i n δ t τ i i 1 n where x i n and y i n are the horizontal and vertical position of particle i respectively at simulation step n u i and v i are the x and y components of the velocity respectively ξ and η are independent and identically distributed iid gaussian variables with zero mean and unit variance δt is a fixed time step t i n is the time for particle i at simulation step n and τ i is a random waiting time 4 τ i t i p u i 0 p u i where the t i are iid exponential with density ψ τ λ exp λτ p is the probabilty of sorption and u i are iid u 0 1 uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 the solid boundaries in the domain are modeled as elastic reflection boundaries any time a particle reflects off a solid boundary it either sorbs with probability p resulting in selecting τ randomly from ψ τ or does not sorb resulting in τ 0 to the leading order this probability can be computed as 5 p α π δ t d for further details on this as well as higher order approximations please see boccardo et al 2018b this number p is compared to a random number u drawn from a standard uniform distribution if u p no sorption occurs and if u p the particle sorbs our choice of solving this system using this lagrangian random walk method is based on the following i it naturally aligns with building an smm which relies on lagrangian statistics ii for a periodic system like this one it is possible to simulate very extensive domains as a particle s velocity at any given time depends only on its local position relative to the periodic cell meaning that we do not need a prohibitively large eulerian mesh and iii for a sufficiently smooth velocity field such as this one it is known not to suffer from numerical dispersion which could be problematic since diffusion and adsorption processes are closely linked for all of the results that we present in this paper we used one million particles and a time step of δt 10 3 consistent with previous experience in the same domain bolster et al 2009 2 3 dimensionless numbers the system described in section 2 2 is characterized by the following dimensionless numbers 6 re h u ν pe h u d da a h α π d da d h 2 λ d u is the mean velocity and ν is the viscosity of the fluid re is the reynolds number which we have already assumed to be small re o 1 in using the prescribed flow field pe is the péclet number which reflects the competition between advection and diffusion processes and typically lies in the range 0 1 pe 103 dykaar kitanidis 1996 we will focus on the higher range of these values as it is known that advection dominated systems are more likely to violate assumptions inherent to taylor dispersion and classical advection disperison upscaling da a and da d are adsorptive and desorptive damköhler numbers which respectively compare the time scales associated with adsorptive and desorptive processes to diffusive ones in a batch system large values of these would correspond to systems close to equilibrium between surface and fluid concentrations in the following any reported dimensionless parameters are obtained by setting u 1 2 h 1 in arbitrary units and tuning d α and λ to obtain specified values of pe da a and da d 2 4 inputs for spatial markov model trajectories travel times and number of hits here we define the inputs that must be obtained from the microscale domain in order to build the macroscale effective smm described in the following section in all cases we obtain these inputs by running a random walk with a flux weighted pulse initial condition at the throat of a pore see fig 1 and simulate transport across one periodic unit cell this calibration simulation is for a conservative random walk that does not include sorption the periodic unit cell corresponds to the blown up region in fig 1 sund et al s 2017b smm is different from others in that it samples trajectories rather than travel times these trajectories are obtained by simulating transport across a single unit cell using 7 x i n 1 x i n u i δ t ξ i 2 d δ t y i n 1 y i n v i δ t η i 2 d δ t i 1 n this is a standard random walk framework note these equations are the same as 3 but without the random waiting times associated with modeling sorption using this we store specific information about each particle s trajectory in sund s approach each trajectory is defined by three parameters i its vertical position at the inlet of the periodic element y in ii the time t it takes to travel from the inlet to the outlet and iii its vertical position at the outlet when it leaves the periodic element y out in addition to these three inputs our method will account for adsorption desorption by storing one additional piece of information iv n hits the number of times a particle strikes a solid boundary when crossing a single cell we propose that by running one high resolution simulation of conservative transport over one periodic element we can obtain all of the required information needed to upscale and describe transport with adsorption and desorption efficiently over much larger scales however it must be noted that for each different value of pe a different calibration simulation is required 2 5 effective transport model the spatial markov model here we propose an smm which is an effective upscaled transport model that describes transport in one dimension aligned with the direction of flow the smm is a time domain random walk model and again the solute is represented by discrete particles whose motion in time and space is governed by 8 x i k 1 x i k l t i k 1 t i k t i k j 1 n hits k τ j tildes refer to upscaled quantities x i k is the horizontal location of particle i at the beginning of step k t i k is the time associated with particle i at the beginning of step k n hits k is the number of times the sampled trajectory strikes the boundary during step k during each step a particle transitions a constant longitudinal distance l the length of our periodic cell and it does so in a random time t which is sampled from a measured travel time distribution the discrete distribution obtained from the single pore calibration simulation in 7 t reflects the range of velocities that particles sample in traversing the unit cell the feature that makes the smm unique relative to other random walk models is that successive temporal increments are not independent of one another correlation arises when a particle that traverses one periodic unit quickly is also likely to traverse the next one quickly and likewise for a slow one in the absence of diffusion particles persist on the same streamline always and so successive jumps would have the same transition time due to diffusion particles can leave streamlines and sample various flow streamlines however when advective effects are strong relative to diffusive ones memory effects persist and must be accounted for through correlation in most applications correlations are applied using a transition matrix le borgne et al 2008a we apply here instead the trajectory based approach recently proposed in sund et al 2017b because the trajectory based method can account for the number of times each trajectory interacts with the boundary in a way that the original transition matrix approach cannot this approach naturally provides a framework that more readily characterizes interactions of particles with the reactive boundary using the information stored as inputs for the smm described in 2 4 it should be noted that the periodic nature of the domain is important in accomplishing this although some other recent studies suggest that trajectory based methods may also work for heterogeneous systems characterized by a stationary heterogeneity distribution wright et al 2019 most 2019 in this implementation of the model each step of length l is associated with a specific particle trajectory we summarize our algorithm in the following steps 1 each particle starts with a given y in reflecting the desired initial condition this sets a specific trajectory that has an associated travel time which is used as the time increment t i k in 8 and an assigned number of hits n hits k 2 adsorption is accounted for by the term j 1 n hits k τ j where each strike with the boundary adds a possible waiting time which is sampled from the same distribution ψ τ as used in 3 with probability p from 5 3 the model then samples the next trajectory randomly using y out as a conditioning criterion for picking the next trajectory by making sure that its y in is close to the previous y out this is done by discretizing the inlet into n bins equi sized bins we used cases with n bins 10 100 and 1000 in this study with no notable difference in results a particle s vertical y location determines which bin it is in thus y out k determines the bin from which the next trajectory is sampled a trajectory with y in k 1 is randomly and uniformly sampled from the same bin that y out k ends in this binning procedure ensures correlation effects are accurately imposed 2 6 observables to test model we will test the proposed smm by comparing its ability to predict downstream transport as measured by breakthrough curves btcs measured at multiple downstream locations these are x 5l 10l 25l and 50l testing the upscaled model against btcs at multiple downstream locations provides a more robust test of the model compared with focusing on only one location sometimes a model can match a single btc due to overparameterization but when the same model can consistently match observations over multiple scales it suggests that the underlying physics is being more faithfully captured thus to produce benchmark data against which to test the smm we run a series of high resolution random walk simulations using the fully resolved transport eq 3 that account for advection diffusion adsorption and desorption in all cases we use a flux weighted pulse initial condition and run single realization simulations with n 106 particles these results are the reference solution against which the upscaled model is tested 3 results 3 1 travel time distributions and number of hits fig 2 displays the empirical travel time distributions measured from simulations across a single periodic element for two cases pe 100 and pe 1000 the data used to plot these travel time distributions is from where temporal increments are sampled these two péclet numbers are chosen because in the case of purely conservative transport it has been shown that for pe 100 incorporating correlation effects is unimportant while for pe 1000 it is bolster et al 2014 these distributions were obtained by creating a histogram of arrival times and normalizing the bin size of the histogram grew logarithmically with larger τ also shown are the number of times a particle trajectory strikes the boundary during a given transition across a single cell most notably for both péclet numbers the vast majority approximately 99 of trajectories never actually strike the boundary and pass through the pore with no possibility of adsorption taking place however some trajectories can strike the boundary anywhere up to 200 times meaning that the likelihood of adsorption can be significant depending on the adsorption rate or the probability of attachment p for the lower péclet number case more trajectories strike the boundary than in the pe 1000 case which intuitively makes sense given that the surface reaction is diffusion driven the expected delay for a reactive particle that strikes the boundary n hits times is τ n hits p λ where the angled brackets denote the expected value finally fig 2 shows a scatter plot of each simulated trajectory s starting location at the inlet against the number of interactions with the boundary this figure clearly highlights that for the pe 1000 case a particle has to start near the boundary in order to have any chance of interacting with it a particle that starts on the centerline y 0 has nearly zero likelihood of interacting with the boundary and thus adsorbing for the pe 100 case the number of hits per trajectory is relatively independent of y in this suggests that accounting for correlation effects i e knowing a particle s starting location as it transitions through each pore may be less important for pe 100 than for pe 1000 as found in the conservative case bolster et al 2014 fig 3 displays the discrete transition probabilities that a particle has for a y out given a particular y in which is a measure of correlation note that this figure is an approximation of the copula density function defining correlation between travel times in consecutive steps massoudieh et al 2017 as has been seen in previous studies for pe 100 this matrix is relatively uniform while there is a stronger diagonal dominance for the pe 1000 case reflecting the fact that correlation effects become stronger as péclet number increases bolster et al 2014 3 2 comparison between dns and smm predicted breakthrough curves 3 2 1 limit of no sorption p 0 to begin we demonstrate the proposed smm s ability to upscale transport in the absence of any sorption at all plots comparing breakthrough curves at multiple downstream locations measured by dns and predicted with the smm are shown in fig 4 as in previous studies the agreement is excellent demonstrating the veracity of our proposed approach 3 3 limit of unit probability next we focus on another limiting case where the probability of sorption each time a particle strikes the boundary is unity p 1 meaning that every strike results in an adsorption event while this may not be an entirely physical condition by considering this extreme case we are testing our proposed procedure across a wide range of possible da a for pe 100 and pe 1000 the respective values are da a 316 and da a 103 the considered values of λ 0 1 and 1 correspond to da d 10 102 and da d 102 103 respectively results comparing dns measured breakthrough curves as well as smm predicted ones are shown in fig 5 additionally for context and to explicitly demonstrate the role of sorption breakthrough curves for the case of zero sorption as discussed in the previous section are also included again the agreement between dns and smm is excellent with the smm capturing all essential features displayed by the fully resolved simulations for the pe 100 case the rising limb of the two earlier breakthrough curves is similar for the cases with and without sorption this corresponds to fast moving particles following trajectories that never interact with the boundary the late time behavior and the further downstream breakthrough curves are very distinct with a strong separation between the case with and without sorption reflecting strong delays due to sorption for the pe 1000 case more particles persist at moving quickly and do not interact with the boundary thus the early arrivals are similar between cases with and without sorption again at late times there is a deviation between the cases with strong delays in the tails emerging for the cases with sorption 3 4 intermediate sorption results corresponding to a sorbing probability that is one order of magnitude smaller than in the previous section p 0 1 are shown in fig 6 which correspond to da a 31 6 and 100 the results demonstrate that the smm provides reliable results across the parameter space the resulting breakthrough curves reflect very similar behavior to the previous case however the tails are not as delayed reflecting the fact that only 10 of particles that sorbed in the p 1 case actually do so here for the pe 1000 and da d 1000 case λ 1 fig 6 top right it is visually next to impossible to see differences at late times while for the longer waiting time da d 100 λ 0 1 fig 6 bottom right a more distinct delayed tailing behavior emerges for the cases with sorption note that breakthrough curves obtained with p 0 1 λ 0 1 bottom row in fig 5 are identical to the ones for p 1 λ 1 case top row in fig 4 because their expected delay times are equivalent this is because on average multiplying both p and λ by a constant has no effect on average travel times 3 5 the role of correlation in this section we test how important including correlation in the smm is for accurately predicting downstream reactive transport behavior to do so an uncorrelated one dimensional time domain random walk tdrw model is built by simply sampling random trajectories without considering the inlet and outlet locations which are the quantities by which we enforce correlation in our model the trajectories are sampled uniformly from the calibration simulation data fig 7 shows the comparisons for all parameter choices considered so far but focusing only the furthest downstream btc x 50l as expected the importance of correlation effects is stronger for the pe 1000 cases than for pe 100 however even for pe 100 distinguishable errors are visible where successive travel times are sampled independently this suggests that while correlation effects are seemingly unimportant for the pe 100 case for conservative transport bolster et al 2014 as sorption at the boundary occurs correlation begins to play some role similar to what has been observed for reactions sund et al 2015b notably when correlation is not accounted for predicted breakthrough curves fail to capture the full rising limbs and also display greater delays than the actual measured ones this reflects the fact that too many particles are interacting with the boundary the uncorrelated model cannot account for the fact that fast particles have a tendency to persist at staying fast as well as the fact that the fastest particles have virtually no probability of getting sorbed as shown in fig 2 while well known that correlation plays an ever more important role as the péclet number of a system increases the effect of boundary reactions on the importance of correlations between successive jumps has not been previously explored fig 8 quantifies this effect based on the approximation of particle arrival times more specifically we consider the recovered mass at time t 9 m t 0 t c x 50 l t d t which is the cumulative distribution function of solute arrival times at x 50l we compute the mean absolute error mae i 1 n t m dns t i m simulated t i between the results obtained via dns and the upscaled simulation with uncorrelated steps at location 50l our results in agreement with previous studies show that the uncorrelated model can yield accurate arrival times of a nonreactive solute da a 0 for pe 100 as the mae attains a value of 5 10 5 the occurrence of adsorption induces an increase of the mae by approximately two orders of magnitude irrespective of the probability with which reaction occurs this is likely because only slower particles ever interact with the boundary and while weak some correlation does occur this does not mean that the model is not sensitive to p indeed it must be since larger values of p result in larger delays it is only saying that correlation effects may be more important to include in the upscaled model when sorption occurs note that when correlation is included the mae is approximately constant for all adsorption probabilities including the conservative case p 0 and attains a value of approximately 10 5 not shown additionally to provide another basis for comparison table 1 shows the arrival times when 1 50 and 99 of the mass has arrived for all of the cases shown in fig 7 we show the dimensionless time for dns and the relative difference r δ between dns and the two models computed as 10 r δ mod t pc mod t pc dns t pc dns where mod stands for unc uncorrelated tdrw or smm and t pc indicates the time corresponding to arrivals of percentile pc of total mass i e pc equals 1 50 and 99 here these results clearly and quantitatively highlight the good agreement between the dns and smm as well as the aforementioned discrepancies between the dns and uncorrelated tdrw model differences between dns and smm are always within 1 showing the robustness of the method on the other hand when correlations are neglected the errors increase sharply with pe i e relative differences between uncorrelated model and dns are up to 10 15 for pe 100 and up to 90 for pe 1000 in general the uncorrelated tdrw overestimates early arrivals and underestimates late arrivals correlation effects also appear to have different influence depending on da a and da d these differences emerge in the 1 and 50 arrival times early arrivals and median time although with relatively smaller variations than the ones observed for pe for early arrivals and median time the uncorrelated model errors tend to increase for increasing da a and decrease with increasing da d i e the error may change up to a factor 2 when the two damköhler numbers change by one order of magnitude 4 discussion and conclusions we have extended the spatial markov model for periodic flow domains proposed in sund et al 2017b to account for linear adsorption to and desorption from solid boundaries in particular we have built the framework based on a trajectory based smm where high resolution trajectories simulated by an advective diffusive random walk over a single periodic flow element are stitched together sequentially to predict transport over much larger scales in this novel approach we merely store one additional piece of information about each trajectory that is the number of times that it strikes a solid boundary this information reflects the solute flux close to the boundary surface that corresponds to the adsorption reaction rate coupling this with a probabilistic representation of sorption boccardo et al 2018b we can effectively upscale transport to represent arbitrary adsorption and desorption rates thus from a single high resolution random walk simulation of conservative transport across one periodic element we can model an extremely diverse range of adsorption desorption behaviors without the need to run further high resolution computationally intensive small scale simulations for each desired case of course this current application is strictly restricted to the example of an idealized periodic setting and it remains to be shown how generalizable it is to more complex and realistic settings as in previous studies of conservative transport the need for the upscaled model to account for correlation between successive jumps depends on the péclet number of the system with correlation being more important as advection begins to dominate more and more similarly it appears that the damköhler numbers play a role in determining how important correlation is merely delineating regions where correlation is important or unimportant for conservative transport does not provide a sufficient condition for the case when reaction occurs this is particularly relevant for the accurate representation of early and late particle arrivals with the upscaled model because these are most sensitive to correlation effects fast particles tend to persist as fast and slow as slow for the conditions explored we have numerically verified that the correlation between subsequent travel times plays a relevant role across the full range of investigated adsorption rates as expected the relevance of correlation is sharply influenced by pe but also increases with da a fast adsorption and decreases with da d fast desorption this trend is particularly striking for early arrivals which could be of practical relevance e g in assessment of membranes life cycle or of risk with contaminant breakthrough in aquifers notably our approach conserves the same accuracy with respect to fully resolved simulations for both conservative and reactive transport our model can accurately upscale kinetic sorption and desorption processes i e it does not assume equilibrium between sorbed and dissolved solute mass as would be the case if modeling adsorption desorption with a retardation coefficient we emphasize that the traditional use of a retardation factor to account for the delays in transport induced by adsorption and desorption will not work to reproduce the cases that we simulate here the main effect of a retardation coefficient would simply be a rescaling in time of a conservative concentration profile or breakthrough curve however the breakthrough curves obtained in this study in many cases have a fundamentally different shape from those without adsorption and desorption the use of a retardation coefficient assumes an instantaneous equilibrium between mobile and immobile parts of the domain and clearly that is not the case here particularly for the higher péclet number case the persistence of correlation effects is very much inline with the fact that highly mobile particles traveling on fast trajectories have virtually no interaction with the boundaries while slower ones can have many reflecting a lack of equilibrium as with upscaling of other transport processes at late times as systems begin to homogenize i e greater than taylor time scales conditions for such an equilibrium can arise but this may or may not be useful depending on
