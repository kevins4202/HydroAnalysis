however they carry a hefty price in this study using low cost corncob as solid slow release carbon source we investigated the effects of different s n ratios 5 8 5 5 and 5 2 on simultaneous denitrification and desulfurization and microbial community structure under continuous flow conditions results showed that nitrate concentration in effluent was maintained below 5 mg l throughout the experiment concurrently 34 89 73 59 and 88 22 of sulfate was removed respectively at the beginning of each stage without the release of hydrogen sulfide microbial community analysis showed that heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria sulfate reducing bacteria autotrophic denitrifying bacteria and hydrolyzing bacteria co existed in the reactor at different s n ratios in particular the relative abundance of autotrophic denitrifying bacteria increased with the increase of s n ratio furthermore the copies of key functional genes of nirk nirs dsra and dsrb also reached the highest when s n ratio was 5 2 therefore simultaneous denitrification and desulfurization by using solid slow release carbon sources provided theoretical references for practical applications graphical abstract

wastewater generated during the production process of steel pharmaceuticals paper mills and petrochemical industries 1 5 physicochemical methods ion exchange and electroosmosis etc are expensive to treat large quantities of wastewater containing high concentrations of nitrate and sulfate and generate post treatment waste on contrary biological methods have a low cost operation and can convert nitrate and sulfate to nitrogen and elemental sulfur which avoid secondary pollution therefore the use of biological methods to treat wastewater is a low cost and environmentally friendly way 6 however due to high concentrations of nitrate and sulfate it is indispensable to add carbon sources to improve the biodegradability of wastewater 7 adding liquid carbon source such as methanol was a common practice in factories 8 9 but this would cause substantial increase in treatment costs and unstable water quality 7 moreover when the water quality and quantity fluctuated the dosage of the liquid carbon source was also changed otherwise the chemical oxygen demand cod would be insufficient or excessive which would cause the effluent water quality to not meet the standard agricultural waste might be used as an economical and effective carbon source in biological treatments 10 12 the removal of nitrate or sulfate by using agricultural waste as solid slow release carbon sources has been widely reported yang et al 13 improved the total nitrogen tn removal efficiencies to reach 62 97 82 34 by using rice straw retinervus luffae fructus and corncob as the solid slow release carbon sources than 43 44 of the blank control filter paper potato and crab shell were used to reduce sulfate by reyes alvarado et al 14 the sulfate reduction efficiencies being 98 82 and 32 respectively the mole ratio of s n is a key factor for simultaneous denitrification and desulfurization 15 cai et al 16 found that sulfide and nitrate removal efficiencies at s n ratio of 5 2 were higher than those of 5 5 and 5 8 in particular when the s n ratio was 5 2 the generation of elemental sulfur and dinitrogen increased and the process of autotrophic denitrification was found to be stable by analyzing the electron balance between reactants because denitrification can occur with either heterotrophic or autotrophic conditions the coexistence of organics and sulfur was common for most wastewater the system of denitrification and desulfurization under autotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions with s n mole ratio of 5 6 was investigated and it showed that bacteria might form a stable coexistence state by using various secondary metabolites or waste metabolites under mixotrophic condition and this relationship was conducive to the stability of the microbial community structure in the denitrification and desulfurization systems 17 however most researches are based on the removal of sulfide and nitrate rather than sulfate and nitrate previously in an anaerobic baffled reactor abr system huang et al 18 achieved separate removals of sulfate and nitrate with sequential sulfate reduction sulfide based denitrifying processes under so4 2 s no3 n ratio were 5 2 5 5 and 5 8 however it may not be possible to treat sulfate and nitrate separately in actual industrial wastewater therefore the integrated simultaneous desulfurization and denitrification isdd process is a novel method to deal with this problem 19 21 at cod so4 2 ratio was 1 5 2 chen et al 22 achieved 100 nitrate and 70 80 sulfate removals and 42 6 elemental sulfur recovery by isdd process with an s n mole ratio was close to 5 5 but the reactor performance decreased since excess sulfide generated at cod so4 2 ratio was 3 cai et al 23 found that dominant desulfurization bacteria were changed and functional genes of sulfur metabolism exhibited negative with adding nitrate up to now there is little research on integrated simultaneous removal of nitrate and sulfate especially using corncob solid carbon source in addition it is worthwhile to explore the relationship between sulfate reduction heterotrophic denitrification and sulfur based autotrophic denitrification since the interactions of microorganisms changed under different s n ratios in order to study the conversion characteristics of nitrogen and sulfur and microbial community structure using corncob solid slow release carbon source as the only organic carbon source and biofilm carriers we investigated the process of simultaneously removing nitrate and sulfate at different s n ratios 5 8 5 5 and 5 2 in the continuous flow reactor moreover batch experiments on sulfur autotrophic denitrification were carried out to further verify the sulfur cycling process the genes of nirk nirs dsra and dsrb in the nitrogen and sulfur cycles were quantitatively analyzed in addition 16s rrna gene sequencing targeting the v3 v4 region was used to characterize microbial phylogeny and functional communities at different s n ratios 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor and operation a laboratory scale integrated simultaneous denitrification and desulfurization bioreactor with a working volume of 1 5 l height of 240 mm and internal diameter of 100 mm was built the bioreactor was a continuous flow reactor synthetic wastewater entered from the bottom of the reactor by peristaltic pump and then overflowed from the top the schema of the bioreactor is shown in fig 1 the oxygen in the synthetic wastewater was driven off by nitrogen for 15 20 min the bioreactor temperature was controlled at 30 1 c by a thermostatic control device and the hydraulic retention time was 24 h the filling height of the corncob was 150 mm in order to prevent the corncob from floating on the top of the reactor a baffle was set at a distance below the water outlet three ports were set on the side wall of the reactor to facilitate the replacement of new corncobs and microbial samples the experiment was divided into three stages with s n mole ratio of 5 8 stage 1 operation for 15 days 5 5 stage 2 operation for 21 days and 5 2 stage 3 operation for 17 days the detailed operating conditions are shown in table 1 2 2 synthetic wastewater fillers and inoculated activated sludge synthetic wastewater in influent tank was prepared from the following ingredients g l na2so4 0 71 kno3 0 87 0 54 0 22 kh2po4 0 1 cacl2 0 1 mgcl2 0 1 and 1 ml l trace elements solution 24 the ph of synthetic wastewater was adjusted to 7 5 0 2 by sodium bicarbonate and hydrochloric acid in the experiment corncob a solid slow release carbon source was used as filler which not only provided the unique organic carbon source but also served as a carrier for biofilms the corncob was broken into a size of about 1 cm3 insufficient organic carbon could cause nitrite accumulation 25 therefore a quarter used corncob was replaced to start the next stage of the experiment when the organic carbon was difficult to continuously support the operation of this stage nitrite accumulated and sulfate hardly removed the activated sludge inoculated in this bioreactor came from the lijiao wastewater treatment plant in guangzhou china and was cultured in the reactor for about 70 days before the start of the formal experiment 2 3 batch experiment batch experiments were conducted to study the conversion characteristics of nitrogen and sulfur thoroughly on the second or third day of each stage an equal amount of denitrifying biomass was taken in the reactor for batch experiments because nitrate and sulfate reduction efficiency reached the highest at this time the denitrifying biomass grown attached to corncob was obtained by washing three times with phosphate buffer saline pbs to ensure that no original nutrient solution remained the nutrient solution was prepared as follows g l na2s 9h2o 0 15 kno3 0 63 k2hpo4 0 1 cacl2 0 1 mgcl2 0 1 and initial ph adjusted to 8 0 with sodium bicarbonate the nutrient solution was prepared for immediate use

performances the effect of different s n on the reduction of nitrate and sulfate under the oligotrophic condition of the slow release carbon source of corncob was studied three stages comprising the stable operation lasted for 53 days the results are shown in fig 2 during the entire operation the average removal efficiency of nitrate was 95 86 this result indicated that denitrifying bacteria adhered and grew on the corncob during stage 1 the mole ratio of s n was 5 8 days 1 15 the average removal efficiency of nitrate was 96 89 but on the 13th day due to insufficient organic carbon sources released by corncob in the reactor the removal of nitrate was incomplete and nitrite began to accumulate in stage 2 the mole ratio of s n was 5 5 days 16 36 and stage 3 the mole ratio of s n was 5 2 days 37 53 the effluent nitrate concentration was less than 5 mg l the average removal efficiency of nitrate was 96 66 and 94 03 respectively meanwhile there was little or no nitrite accumulation and ammonia nitrogen transformation fig 2a it showed that denitrification process was hardly affected by sulfate within a certain concentration range for sulfate reduction when the nitrate concentration decreased in the reactor the reduced total amount of sulfate and the reduction ability increased gradually it was observed from fig 2b that sulfate could be reduced at the beginning of the stages and the reduction efficiency reached the highest at this time sulfate reduction efficiencies were 34 89 73 59 and 88 22 in stages 1 3 respectively at the same time elemental sulfur was generated with the sulfate reduced in the reactor but hydrogen sulfide thiosulfate and sulfite were not detected in gas or water quality detection at all stages however in the middle and the late phases of each stage sulfate reduction was significantly reduced results showed that sulfate reduction was inhibited with a higher nitrate concentration since more organic carbon was consumed by denitrifying but sulfate also reduced efficiently with abundant organic carbon source during the beginning of each stage elemental sulfur might be produced by sulfide providing electrons for denitrification 26 27 during the middle and the late phases of each stage inhibition of sulfate reduction might be caused by insufficient cod fig 2c the corncob released cod quickly at the beginning of the stages but as the reaction continued cod was continuously consumed therefore sulfate reduction was restrained due to lack of electron donors the results indicated that it could achieve simultaneous removal of nitrate and sulfate under s n mole ratio of 5 8 5 5 and 5 2 by using corncob as a solid slow release carbon source to provide the required energy for microbial growth and metabolism 3 1 2 the changes of cod and do cod and do were important indicators in the nitrogen sulfur cycle and their changes are shown in fig 2c a quarter of used corncobs were replaced by fresh corncobs into the reactor before each stage cod and do were measured every 24 h the value of cod reached the highest on the first day and then decreased continuously the final effluent cod of stages 1 to 3 was 50 80 mg l the value of effluent cod at the beginning of the stage reached the highest because corncob solid slow release carbon source could quickly release high concentration of soluble carbon source 13 this was the possible reason why most of the sulfate was reduced at this time and reached the peak in the first few days with the operation of the reactor cod presented a trend of rapid decline first and then declined slowly perhaps cod released by the corncob solid carbon source was mainly produced by the degradation of microorganisms with cellulose hydrolase in the middle and late stages the final effluent residual cod could be caused by carbon source unutilized by microorganisms the do value showed a continuous upward trend with the cod consumed 3 2 batch experiment the batch experiment was investigated to verify the transformation of nitrogen and sulfur dissimilatory sulfate reduction led by srb played a critical role in the sulfur cycle most srbs belong to phylum proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroides and their dominant common dissimilatory sulfate reduction process was to reduce sulfate to sulfide through sulfite 28 29 recently through metagenomic analysis of the dissimilatory sulfate reductase dsr genes labeled with srb it was found that several srbs such as desulfobacter desulfococcus desulfobacula and desulfobacterales with complete sulfate reduction gene could dissimilate reduced sulfate to elemental sulfur instead of sulfide 30 however according to otu species classification statistics several srbs mentioned above were non existent in the bioreactor therefore it could be considered that sulfide which was reduced by sulfate was oxidized to elemental sulfur was generated by autotrophic denitrification 31 if the water contained a certain amount of sulfide it could promote the growth of autotrophic denitrifying bacteria moreover the mole ratio of s n could significantly affect the sulfur autotrophic denitrification process under mixotrophic conditions 17 32 at the same time this process also enhanced the reduction of nitrate and sulfate while on one hand sulfur based autotrophic denitrification accelerated the removal of nitrate 33 on the other the continuous consumption of sulfide promoted the reduction of sulfate in order to study the conversion characteristics of nitrogen and sulfur thoroughly we conducted batch experiments the results are shown in fig 3 nitrate concentration in stage 1 hardly changed while the nitrate removal efficiency in stage 2 and stage 3 reached more than 50 this result showed that bacteria in stage 2 and stage 3 could use sulfide as an electron donor to reduce nitrate effectively performing the autotrophic denitrification process it suggested that both heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrifying bacteria existed in the reactor when such coexistence occurred they would compete for nitrate under limited supply 17 the reaction rate of converting nitrate to nitrite through the autotrophic denitrification pathway was faster than the heterotrophic denitrification process 34 in contrast the reaction rate of heterotrophic metabolism of nitrite to nitrogen was faster than autotrophic metabolism although sulfide could inhibit the activity of heterotrophic bacteria and the accumulation of nitrite could also inhibit the growth of sulfur autotrophic denitrifying bacteria this occurred with a higher concentration obviously it was not enough to affect the substrate concentration of the batch experiment therefore the accumulation of nitrite at the end might be the product of sulfur autotrophic denitrification which mainly reduced nitrate to nitrite furthermore the reduction of nitrite to n2 mainly depended on heterotrophic denitrification to achieve 3 3 key functional genes two key functional genes related to denitrification were detected in the biofilm nirs and nirk which coded for nitrite reductase that determined the key steps of the denitrification process two functional genes related to both sulfate reduction and sulfur oxidation were detected dsra and dsrb which encode the α and β subunits of dissimilation sulfite reductase the pcr quantitative data of key functional genes are shown in fig 4 from stage 1 to stage 3 the gene copies of nirs and nirk increased rapidly this might be related to autotrophic denitrification in the reactor first with the continuous strengthening of autotrophic denitrification it accelerated the conversion of nitrate to nitrite and promoted the gene expression of nirs and nirk second many researches confirmed that nirs and nirk could play a role in autotrophic denitrification 35 37 the gene copies of dsra and dsrb also increased with the increase of s n which was also consistent with the performance of the reactor when the concentration of nitrate decreased more electron donors were used for sulfate reduction and dsra and dsrb mainly converted sulfite into sulfide in the sulfur cycle the formation of sulfide contributed to the occurrence of autotrophic denitrification at the same time it was reported that the dsra gene might play a key role in the sulfur oxidation process 38 in fact dsra and dsrb genes were involved in the oxidation of elemental sulfur in the process of sulfur oxidation 39 sulfide provided electrons for denitrification and was oxidized to elemental sulfur while dsra and dsrb used elemental sulfur as electron donors for autotrophic denitrification 3 4 microbial community analysis in the system 3 4 1 abundance and diversity analysis three sludge samples were collected to identify the change of the microbial community structure from different stages the α diversity index was used to analyze the abundance and diversity of bacteria at each stage and the results are shown in fig 5a the higher the values of chao and ace index the higher the species abundance 40 the higher the value of shannon index the higher the diversity and complexity of the community 41 the chao ace and shannon indexes all showed a trend of falling first and then rising this was possible because the concentration of sulfide produced in stage 2 was toxic to some bacteria while the conversion of a large amount of sulfate into sulfide promoted the growth of some bacteria that used sulfide as electron donors the species richness and community diversity were improved in stage 3 using beta diversity index nmds analysis the similarity or difference of community composition between different stages samples was explored by comparing and analyzing the species diversity of different microbial communities the results are shown in fig 5b the closer the two sample points were the more similar was the species composition of the two samples stress value indicated the pros and cons of nmds analysis results when the stress was less than 0 05 it showed that it had good representativeness in nmds analysis the sample points of stages 1 2 and 3 were all far apart results showed that the bacterial community structure of the three stages was quite different the main reasons for this phenomenon were as follows 1 due to the nitrate load of the influent changed the corresponding abundance of denitrifying bacteria will change accordingly 2 as the consumption of electron donors by denitrifying decreased the abundance of sulfate reducing bacteria increased 3 sulfate converted to sulfide by srbs promoted the autotrophic denitrification process in the reactor which also made autotrophic bacteria gradually dominated 3 4 2 microbial community structure the diversity of the microbial community was analyzed using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing in the v3 v4 region results indicated that the bacterial phyla with high relative abundance in stages 1 3 were the same but the difference was the abundance of phyla fig 6a proteobacteria bacteroidota firmicutes desulfobacterota campilobacterota and actinobacteriota were the dominant phyla of stages 1 3 the sum of relative abundance accounting for more than 94 90 and 92 respectively among them reports on proteobacteria showed that this phylum played an important role in the co reduction of nitrate and sulfate 42 44 and proteobacteria had the highest relative abundance in the system similarly phylum bacteroidota could not only reduce nitrate nitrite to nitrogen but use sulfate as the electron acceptor 45 47 moreover some hydrolytic fermentative bacteria belong to the phylum bacteroidota and some fermentation bacteria from firmicutes and proteobacteria have been reported 48 therefore the carbon source available for microorganisms in the solid corncob could be released by these bacterial phyla desulfobacterota could use sulfate sulfite thiosulfate and elemental sulfur as electron donors under anoxic conditions 49 the campilobacterota phylum was mainly predicted to contribute to the process of sulfur oxidation 50 thus these main functional bacterial phyla with high relative abundance in the system were involved in the carbon nitrogen sulfur cycle together the result was consistent with previous reports that proteobacteria bacteroidota and actinobacteriota were common dominant bacteria phyla in the denitrification process while phyla proteobacteria bacteroidota desulfobacterota and campilobacterota also played a vital role in the sulfur cycle bacteroidota and firmicutes supplied the carbon source by degrading cellulose to determine further which genera were responsible for nitrogen removal and sulfur cycle among different s n ratios an analysis at the genus level was performed and the bacterial communities at three stages are shown in fig 6b dechloromonas and thiobacillus were the main genera of proteobacteria which simultaneously carried out nitrogen and sulfur cycling as shown in fig 6b dechloromonas was the dominant bacteria in stage 1 12 24 and stage 2 19 64 and the dominant bacteria in stage 3 was thiobacillus 11 12 dechloromonas has been frequently reported to play a leading role in nitrate reduction and is a nitrate and or sulfate biodegrading bacteria 51 52 thiobacillus is an obligate autotrophic microorganism which can oxidize reduced sulfide such as h2s s2o3 2 or elemental sulfur to sulfate and use nitrate as an electron acceptor for autotrophic denitrification 53 high throughput sequencing and clonal library analysis found that thiobacillus was the most advantageous autotrophic denitrifying bacteria 36 in stage 1 except for dechlormonas the relative abundances of trichlorobacter desulfovibrio bacteroides anaerobacterium and dysgonomonas were close which were between 3 5 and 5 3 trichlorobacter can be involved in the sulfur cycling process desulfovibrio 54 is a typical microorganism for studying srb bacteroides 55 56 anaerobacterium 57 and dysgonomonas 58 are hydrolyzing or fermenting microorganisms they could effectively secrete lignocellulose enzymes to promote the hydrolysis of corncob and degrade it into organic acids alcohols such as acetic acid propionic acid lactic acid or ethanol sulfurospirillum and arcobacter which were rarely observed in satge1 and stage 3 were the key bacteria in stage 2 with an abundance of 17 26 sulfurospirillum and arcobacter belong to the genera of sobs and use sulfide as an electron donor and nitrate as an electron acceptor for sulfur autotrophic denitrification and oxidize the sulfide into filamentous sulfur 59 60 in stage 3 autotrophic denitrification was performed by thiobacillus sulfur metabolism occurred more frequently as the concentration of nitrate decreased the abundance of thiobacillus increasing rapidly in stage 3 this showed that thiobacillus was sensitive to reduced sulfide which was also conducive to the occurrence of autotrophic denitrification naturally it was not a positive correlation with the sulfide concentration excessive sulfide concentration might inhibit the activity of nitrate reductase 61 the unclassified gammaproteobacteria with higher relative abundance in stage 3 might have relative capacities for sulfur oxidation and nitrate nitrite reduction 62 the norank f phos he36 might have a capacity for denitrification 63 therefore as the amount of sulfate converted into sulfide increased bacteria that used sulfide as an electron donor in the reactor were gradually dominative table 2 a system that could achieve simultaneous denitrification and desulfurization was built 4 conclusions as solid slow release carbon source corncob could be used to simultaneously remove nitrate and sulfate meanwhile nitrate concentration in the effluent from the reactor was below 5 mg l throughout the experiment at different s n ratios sulfate could hardly affect the removal of nitrate however the reduction products of sulfate could promote nitrate reduction on the contrary the reduction of sulfate was closely related to the concentration of nitrate when s n ratio was 5 8 the electron donors were insufficient for sulfate reduction the results of functional gene and microbial community analysis showed that the coexistence of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria sulfate reducing bacteria autotrophic denitrifying bacteria and hydrolyzing bacteria was beneficial to promote the simultaneous removal of carbon nitrogen and sulfur in the reactor declaration of competing interest

trace elements solution 24 the ph of synthetic wastewater was adjusted to 7 5 0 2 by sodium bicarbonate and hydrochloric acid in the experiment corncob a solid slow release carbon source was used as filler which not only provided the unique organic carbon source but also served as a carrier for biofilms the corncob was broken into a size of about 1 cm3 insufficient organic carbon could cause nitrite accumulation 25 therefore a quarter used corncob was replaced to start the next stage of the experiment when the organic carbon was difficult to continuously support the operation of this stage nitrite accumulated and sulfate hardly removed the activated sludge inoculated in this bioreactor came from the lijiao wastewater treatment plant in guangzhou china and was cultured in the reactor for about 70 days before the start of the formal experiment 2 3 batch experiment batch experiments were conducted to study the conversion characteristics of nitrogen and sulfur thoroughly on the second or third day of each stage an equal amount of denitrifying biomass was taken in the reactor for batch experiments because nitrate and sulfate reduction efficiency reached the highest at this time the denitrifying biomass grown attached to corncob was obtained by washing three times with phosphate buffer saline pbs to ensure that no original nutrient solution remained the nutrient

performances the effect of different s n on the reduction of nitrate and sulfate under the oligotrophic condition of the slow release carbon source of corncob was studied three stages comprising the stable operation lasted for 53 days the results are shown in fig 2 during the entire operation the average removal efficiency of nitrate was 95 86 this result indicated that denitrifying bacteria adhered and grew on the corncob during stage 1 the mole ratio of s n was 5 8 days 1 15 the average removal efficiency of nitrate was 96 89 but on the 13th day due to insufficient organic carbon sources released by corncob in the reactor the removal of nitrate was incomplete and nitrite began to accumulate in stage 2 the mole ratio of s n was 5 5 days 16 36 and stage 3 the mole ratio of s n was 5 2 days 37 53 the effluent nitrate concentration was less than 5 mg l the average removal efficiency of nitrate was 96 66 and 94 03 respectively meanwhile there was little or no nitrite accumulation and ammonia nitrogen transformation fig 2a it showed that denitrification process was hardly affected by sulfate within a certain concentration range for sulfate reduction when the nitrate concentration decreased in the reactor the reduced total amount of sulfate and the reduction ability increased gradually it was observed from fig 2b that sulfate could be reduced at the beginning of the stages and the reduction efficiency reached the highest at this time sulfate reduction efficiencies were 34 89 73 59 and 88 22 in stages 1 3 respectively at the same time elemental sulfur was generated with the sulfate reduced in the reactor but hydrogen sulfide thiosulfate and sulfite were not detected in gas or water quality detection at all stages however in the middle and the late phases of each stage sulfate reduction was significantly reduced results showed that sulfate reduction was inhibited with a higher nitrate concentration since more organic carbon was consumed by denitrifying but sulfate also reduced efficiently with abundant organic carbon source during the beginning of each stage elemental sulfur might be produced by sulfide providing electrons for denitrification 26 27 during the middle and the late phases of each stage inhibition of sulfate reduction might be caused by insufficient cod fig 2c the corncob released cod quickly at the beginning of the stages but as the reaction continued cod was continuously consumed therefore sulfate reduction was restrained due to lack of electron donors the results indicated that it could achieve simultaneous removal of nitrate and sulfate under s n mole ratio of 5 8 5 5 and 5 2 by using corncob as a solid slow release carbon source to provide the required energy for microbial growth and metabolism 3 1 2 the changes of cod and do cod and do were important indicators in the nitrogen sulfur cycle and their changes are shown in fig 2c a quarter of used corncobs were replaced by fresh corncobs into the reactor before each stage cod and do were measured every 24 h the value of cod reached the highest on the first day and then decreased continuously the final effluent cod of stages 1 to 3 was 50 80 mg l the value of effluent cod at the beginning of the stage reached the highest because corncob solid slow release carbon source could quickly release high concentration of soluble carbon source 13 this was the possible reason why most of the sulfate was reduced at this time and reached the peak in the first few days with the operation of the reactor cod presented a trend of rapid decline first and then declined slowly perhaps cod released by the corncob solid carbon source was mainly produced by the degradation of microorganisms with cellulose hydrolase in the middle and late stages the final effluent residual cod could be caused by carbon source unutilized by microorganisms the do value showed a continuous upward trend with the cod consumed 3 2 batch experiment the batch experiment was investigated to verify the transformation of nitrogen and sulfur dissimilatory sulfate reduction led by srb played a critical role in the sulfur cycle most srbs belong to phylum proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroides and their dominant common dissimilatory sulfate reduction process was to reduce sulfate to sulfide through sulfite 28 29 recently through metagenomic analysis of the dissimilatory sulfate reductase dsr genes labeled with srb it was found that several srbs such as desulfobacter desulfococcus desulfobacula and desulfobacterales with complete sulfate reduction gene could dissimilate reduced sulfate to elemental sulfur instead of sulfide 30 however according to otu species classification statistics several srbs mentioned above were non existent in the bioreactor therefore it could be considered that sulfide which was reduced by sulfate was oxidized to elemental sulfur was generated by autotrophic denitrification 31 if the water contained a certain amount of sulfide it could promote the growth of autotrophic denitrifying bacteria moreover the mole ratio of s n could significantly affect the sulfur autotrophic denitrification process under mixotrophic conditions 17 32 at the same time this process also enhanced the reduction of nitrate and sulfate while on one hand sulfur based autotrophic denitrification accelerated the removal of nitrate 33 on the other the continuous consumption of sulfide promoted the reduction of sulfate in order to study the conversion characteristics of nitrogen and sulfur thoroughly we conducted batch experiments the results are shown in fig 3 nitrate concentration in stage 1 hardly changed while the nitrate removal efficiency in stage 2 and stage 3 reached more than 50 this result showed that bacteria in stage 2 and stage 3 could use sulfide as an electron donor to reduce nitrate effectively performing the autotrophic denitrification process it suggested that both heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrifying bacteria existed in the reactor when such coexistence occurred they would compete for nitrate under limited supply 17 the reaction rate of converting nitrate to nitrite through the autotrophic denitrification pathway was faster than the heterotrophic denitrification process 34 in contrast the reaction rate of heterotrophic metabolism of nitrite to nitrogen was faster than autotrophic metabolism although sulfide could inhibit the activity of heterotrophic bacteria and the accumulation of nitrite could also inhibit the growth of sulfur autotrophic denitrifying bacteria this occurred with a higher concentration obviously it was not enough to affect the substrate concentration of the batch experiment therefore the accumulation of nitrite at the end might be the product of sulfur autotrophic denitrification which mainly reduced nitrate to nitrite furthermore the reduction of nitrite to n2 mainly depended on heterotrophic denitrification to achieve 3 3 key functional genes two key functional genes related to denitrification were detected in the biofilm nirs and nirk which coded for nitrite reductase that determined the key steps of the denitrification process two functional genes related to both sulfate reduction and sulfur oxidation were detected dsra and dsrb which encode the α and β subunits of dissimilation sulfite reductase the pcr quantitative data of key functional genes are shown in fig 4 from stage 1 to stage 3 the gene copies of nirs and nirk increased rapidly this might be related to autotrophic denitrification in the reactor first with the continuous strengthening of autotrophic denitrification it accelerated the conversion of nitrate to nitrite and promoted the gene expression of nirs and nirk second many researches confirmed that nirs and nirk could play a role in autotrophic denitrification 35 37 the gene copies of dsra and dsrb also increased with the increase of s n which was also consistent with the performance of the reactor when the concentration of nitrate decreased more electron donors were used for sulfate reduction and dsra and dsrb mainly converted sulfite into sulfide in the sulfur cycle the formation of sulfide contributed to the occurrence of autotrophic denitrification at the same time it was reported that the dsra gene might play a key role in the sulfur oxidation process 38 in fact dsra and dsrb genes were involved in the oxidation of elemental sulfur in the process of sulfur oxidation 39 sulfide provided electrons for denitrification and was oxidized to elemental sulfur while dsra and dsrb used elemental sulfur as electron donors for autotrophic denitrification 3 4 microbial community analysis in the system 3 4 1 abundance and diversity analysis three sludge samples were collected to identify the change of the microbial community structure from different stages the α diversity index was used to analyze the abundance and diversity of bacteria at each stage and the results are shown in fig 5a the higher the values of chao and ace index the higher the species abundance 40 the higher the value of shannon index the higher the diversity and complexity of the community 41 the chao ace and shannon indexes all showed a trend of falling first and then rising this was possible because the concentration of sulfide produced in stage 2 was toxic to some bacteria while the conversion of a large amount of sulfate into sulfide promoted the growth of some bacteria that used sulfide as electron donors the species richness and community diversity were improved in stage 3 using beta diversity index nmds analysis the similarity or difference of community composition between different stages samples was explored by comparing and analyzing the species diversity of different microbial communities the results are shown in fig 5b the closer the two sample points were the more similar was the species composition of the two samples stress value indicated the pros and cons of nmds analysis results when the stress was less than 0 05 it showed that it had good representativeness in nmds analysis the sample points of stages 1 2 and 3 were all far apart results showed that the bacterial community structure of the three stages was quite different the main reasons for this phenomenon were as follows 1 due to the nitrate load of the influent changed the corresponding abundance of denitrifying bacteria will change accordingly 2 as the consumption of electron donors by denitrifying decreased the abundance of sulfate reducing bacteria increased 3 sulfate converted to sulfide by srbs promoted the autotrophic denitrification process in the reactor which also made autotrophic bacteria gradually dominated 3 4 2 microbial community structure the diversity of the microbial community was analyzed using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing in the v3 v4 region results indicated that the bacterial phyla with high relative abundance in stages 1 3 were the same but the difference was the abundance of phyla fig 6a proteobacteria bacteroidota firmicutes desulfobacterota campilobacterota and actinobacteriota were the dominant phyla of stages 1 3 the sum of relative abundance accounting for more than 94 90 and 92 respectively among them reports on proteobacteria showed that this phylum played an important role in the co reduction of nitrate and sulfate 42 44 and proteobacteria had the highest relative abundance in the system similarly phylum bacteroidota could not only reduce nitrate nitrite to nitrogen but use sulfate as the electron acceptor 45 47 moreover some hydrolytic fermentative bacteria belong to the phylum bacteroidota and some fermentation bacteria from firmicutes and proteobacteria have been reported 48 therefore the carbon source available for microorganisms in the solid corncob could be released by these bacterial phyla desulfobacterota could use sulfate sulfite thiosulfate and elemental sulfur as electron donors under anoxic conditions 49 the campilobacterota phylum was mainly predicted to contribute to the process of sulfur oxidation 50 thus these main functional bacterial phyla with high relative abundance in the system were involved in the carbon nitrogen sulfur cycle together the result was consistent with previous reports that proteobacteria bacteroidota and actinobacteriota were common dominant bacteria phyla in the denitrification process while phyla proteobacteria bacteroidota desulfobacterota and campilobacterota also played a vital role in the sulfur cycle bacteroidota and firmicutes supplied the carbon source by degrading cellulose to determine further which genera were responsible for nitrogen removal and sulfur cycle among different s n ratios an analysis at the genus level was performed and the bacterial communities at three stages are shown in fig 6b dechloromonas and thiobacillus were the main genera of proteobacteria which simultaneously carried out nitrogen and sulfur cycling as shown in fig 6b dechloromonas was the dominant bacteria in stage 1 12 24 and stage 2 19 64 and the dominant bacteria in stage 3 was thiobacillus 11 12 dechloromonas has been frequently reported to play a leading role in nitrate reduction and is a nitrate and or sulfate biodegrading bacteria 51 52 thiobacillus is an obligate autotrophic microorganism which can oxidize reduced sulfide such as h2s s2o3 2 or elemental sulfur to sulfate and use nitrate as an electron acceptor for autotrophic denitrification 53 high throughput sequencing and clonal library analysis found that thiobacillus was the most advantageous autotrophic denitrifying bacteria 36 in stage 1 except for dechlormonas the relative abundances of trichlorobacter desulfovibrio bacteroides anaerobacterium and dysgonomonas were close which were between 3 5 and 5 3 trichlorobacter can be involved in the sulfur cycling process desulfovibrio 54 is a typical microorganism for studying srb bacteroides 55 56 anaerobacterium 57 and dysgonomonas 58 are hydrolyzing or fermenting microorganisms they could effectively secrete lignocellulose enzymes to promote the hydrolysis of corncob and degrade it into organic acids alcohols such as acetic acid propionic acid lactic acid or ethanol sulfurospirillum and arcobacter which were rarely observed in satge1 and stage 3 were the key bacteria in stage 2 with an abundance of 17 26 sulfurospirillum and arcobacter belong to the genera of sobs and use sulfide as an electron donor and nitrate as an electron acceptor for sulfur autotrophic denitrification and oxidize the sulfide into filamentous sulfur 59 60 in stage 3 autotrophic denitrification was performed by thiobacillus sulfur metabolism occurred more frequently as the concentration of nitrate decreased the abundance of thiobacillus increasing rapidly in stage 3 this showed that thiobacillus was sensitive to reduced sulfide which was also conducive to the occurrence of autotrophic denitrification naturally it was not a positive correlation with the sulfide concentration excessive sulfide concentration might inhibit the activity of nitrate reductase 61 the unclassified gammaproteobacteria with higher relative abundance in stage 3 might have relative capacities for sulfur oxidation and nitrate nitrite reduction 62 the norank f phos he36 might have a capacity for denitrification 63 therefore as the amount of sulfate converted into sulfide increased bacteria that used sulfide as an electron donor in the reactor were gradually dominative table 2 a system that could achieve simultaneous denitrification and desulfurization was built 4 conclusions as solid slow release carbon source corncob could be used to simultaneously remove nitrate and sulfate meanwhile nitrate concentration in the effluent from the reactor was below 5 mg l throughout the experiment at different s n ratios sulfate could hardly affect the removal of nitrate however the reduction products of sulfate could promote nitrate reduction on the contrary the reduction of sulfate was closely related to the concentration of nitrate when s n ratio was 5 8 the electron donors were insufficient for sulfate reduction the results of functional gene and microbial community analysis showed that the coexistence of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria sulfate reducing bacteria autotrophic denitrifying bacteria and hydrolyzing bacteria was beneficial to promote the simultaneous removal of carbon nitrogen and sulfur in the reactor declaration of competing interest

13051,black odor water not only completely loses the function but also seriously affects the environment landscape and human health aiming at the problems of high cost and low activity of catalysts for black odor waters treatment by catalytic ozonation technology this paper fabricated a stable ti based supported catalyst using the modified waste clay ceramsite ti mc1 combined with the ozone uv technology this catalyst realized effective degradation of pollutants in actual black odor waters based on the catalytic kinetics analysis it showed that the prepared catalyst performance generally higher activity than those with other carriers or active components as a kind of wastes reuse waste ceramsite is environment friendly with high economic efficiency which gives it higher practical value and popularization prospect under the optimal conditions the removal rates of nh3 n and cod in water have reached 72 08 and 80 07 respectively in addition by monitoring the physiological indexes of representative submerged macrophytes during the operation process it could be concluded that the constructed technology will not hinder the normal growth of aquatic organisms in real water environment which confirms the feasibility of its application the results provided a new idea for the application of nature based processes in aqueous environment management and remediation while also provided a theoretical basis for efficient treatment of black odor waters graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ozone catalytic oxidation ceramsite black odor waters 1 introduction when the water body is seriously polluted the aerobic decomposition of organic matter causes the rate of oxygen consumption to be higher than that of reoxygenation because of the lack of oxygen the incomplete degradation of organic matter with slow rate starts the process of anaerobic biodegradation anaerobic biodegradation produces hydrogen sulfide ammonia mercaptan and other odorous substances and at the same time forms black substance 1 black odor waters is a serious water pollution phenomenon as the water body completely loses the function and will be seriously affects the environment landscape as well as the human health 2 currently the main methods of treating black odor waters are microbial growth promoting method 3 river aeration technology 4 carbon fiber based biofilm carrier technology 5 water ecological purification and pollution control method 6 algae and bacteria treatment method 7 however due to the long repairing cycle these methods can be easily influenced by the season and the content of refractory organic matter in water which limited their application in emergency response therefore an efficient process with low interference and high speed for the treatment of black odorous waterbodies is urgently needed to be developed ozone was used as strong oxidant to degrade the organic matter in the water body either directly or indirectly since ozone was nontoxic harmless and can improve the biodegradability of the treated water body researches showed that the treatment effect of ozone aeration technology was significantly better than that of some conventional aeration not only the concentration of dissolved oxygen in water could be increased greatly 8 and the microbial population was inactivated rapidly in large quantities but also the amount of ozone with less environmental interference can be controlled 9 shen et al used ozonation technology to study the high standard advanced treatment of refractory organic compounds in the secondary effluent from a concentrated sewage treatment in an industrial agglomeration area the results showed that ozone as a pre oxidation measure could greatly improve the biodegradability and enhanced the biodegradation of wastewater 10 however due to the low solubility of ozone in water the utilization ratio of ozone needed to be further improved 11 to this end researchers tried to add catalysts in the ozone oxidation process published research showed that by adding some metal oxides or metal ions as catalysts during the ozonation process ozone decomposition can be promoted to produce oh which improves the ozone utilization rate as well as the reaction process 12 liu et al successfully prepared fe mn ooh catalyst by alkaline coprecipitation method and applied it to ozonation process it was confirmed that the degradation efficiency of this catalytic oxidation technology was higher than that of ozonation alone 13 the most commonly catalysts used in ozonation are carbon based catalysts metal oxides and supported catalysts as one of the most effective catalysts for ozonation the supported catalysts with controlled particle size of active components can enhance the enrichment of ozone and organic compounds on the surface of the catalysts by the loading strategy it can improve the mass transfer and the electron transfer at the micro interface 14 currently the commonly used components include ni fe cu ti etc with respect to degradation rates and the range in contaminants treated bimetals such as nife or pdfe generally outperform unamended granular iron jianming chen and his companions suggested that the use of bimetals in above groundwater treatment applications could become practical with appropriate engineering design 15 however the raw materials of most high efficiency catalyst obtained through specific chemical process the high cost in human and material hinders its large scale popularization and application 16 in recent years the resource utilization of waste not only protected the environment but also saved resources 17 the waste utilization reduced the use of other non renewable resources which was beneficial to the sustainable development of society the waste clay ceramsite as a potential catalyst carrier was eco friendly and cheap compared with activated carbon 18 19 of which the rough surface can increase the contact area between the active components and the substrate 20 herein we used the waste clay ceramsite as basic catalyst carrier combined to the active component ti which possess high catalytic ability the supported ti based catalysts were prepared due to the intense photochemical reaction of ozone under ultraviolet irradiation 21 22 the formation of strong oxidizing oh can be accelerated which further improve the efficiency of pollutant treatment therefore an ozone uv combined process based on ti ceramsite catalyst was developed and subsequently applied to the degradation of pollutants in black odor waters through ozone catalytic oxidation process the catalytic mechanism was elucidated by the characterizations of the micro morphology and crystalline phase of the catalyst as well as the analysis of catalytic kinetics 23 in addition in order to comprehensively evaluate the applying feasibility of this method in real environment the physiological growth indexes of representative aquatic organisms were also monitored during technology operating process 24 25 2 materials and methods 2 1 sources of material the basic waste clay ceramsite were obtained from a building materials market in nanjing the black odor waters sample was taken from the raw river water in the campus of nanjing university of technology the water quality was analyzed as follows cod 60 70 mg l ammonia nitrogen 10 15 mg l ph 6 5 7 5 water temperature 20 25 c activated alumina sodium hydroxide ammonia and other chemical reagents were purchased from nanjing shengqinghe chemical co ltd 2 2 instruments high temperature calcination was finished by muffle furnace model sxqf 5 12 hangzhou blue sky instrument scanning electron microscope images were gained from sem model jeol jsm 6700 japan electronic corporation bet analysis was realized by a specific surface area analyzer model tristar 3020 mcmurray tyco shanghai instrument co ltd x ray diffraction patterns were measured on model xrd 7000 shimadzu company japan ozone was prepared by the generator model jr s10g h nanjing jinren 2 3 catalyst preparation 2 3 1 modification of waste clay ceramsite the original waste clay ceramsite mc0 2 3 mm particle size was modified by hydrothermal method 26 mc0 was immersed in 1 0 mol l 1 hcl and 1 0 mol l 1 naoh for 24 h respectively after being washed and dried mc0 was put into the mixed solution of glucose ferrous ammonium sulfate anhydrous and distilled water at a weight ratio of 2 1 12 followed by being transferred to teflon lined autoclave for solvothermal reaction for 12 h at 180 c the product cooled naturally to room temperature was subsequently washed by ultrapure water the modified waste clay ceramsite mc1 was obtained by drying it at 80 c for 3 h 2 3 2 ti mc1 catalyst preparation ti mc1 catalyst was prepared by sol gel method 27 solution a was composed of anhydrous ethanol hydrochloric acid and deionized water at a volume ratio of 250 5 10 solution b was composed of butyl titanate and anhydrous ethanol at a volume ratio of 100 125 tio2 sol was formed by adding solution a to solution b slowly under continuous stirring subsequently mc1 was soaked in the tio2 sol for 20 min and then washed by ultrapure water the product was dried at 120 c for 72 h and calcined at 550 c for 2 h to obtain ti mc1 catalyst 2 3 3 other catalysts to fabricate other catalysts including fe mc1 fe mn mc1 fe cu mc1 and mn cu mc1 mc1 was immersed in different solution table s1 in supplementary information respectively for 16 h each mixture was stirred continuously for 1 h at the beginning of immersion then the mixture was dried at 120 c for 5 h and baked at 550 c for 5 h 2 4 sewage treatment in order to eliminate the influence of the adsorption of catalyst on the process effect at the beginning of each experiment the reactor was filled with catalyst and raw water successively for 20 min the water sample was discharged when the catalyst was saturated in adsorption then the raw water sample was reinjected into the reactor again typically 1 l water sample was injected into the reactor filled with 150 g l catalyst by peristaltic pump circulating water the ultraviolet lamp was turned on and 4 mg l ozone was fed into the reactor the samples were filtered from the outlet at regular intervals 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the catalysts the surface morphology of the catalyst was observed by sem as shown in fig 1 a the surface of mc0 was rough and irregular which made it had good surface modification condition after modification from the sem photograph of mc1 in fig 1 b it could be seen that the porosity of mc0 was improved the uneven distribution of carbonized particles on the surface was beneficial to the subsequent loading of active components as shown in fig 1 c the surface of ti mc1 was covered by closely packed layers of particles after being loaded with ti in the process of calcination at high temperature metal oxides loaded irregularly on the surface of mc1 which improved the specific surface area and porosity as shown in table 1 it doubtlessly contributed to the contact between the catalyst and the wastewater xrd pattern was employed to analyze the crystal structure of the prepared catalysts fig 2 it could be seen that there was no obvious difference between the characteristic peaks of each ceramsite carrier the sharp characteristic peaks indicated that the chemical components of the catalysts have not changed under long time high temperature calcination as well as the crystal structure which proved its good chemical and structural stability compared with jcpds standard card the typical diffraction peaks of mc1 were corresponded to sio2 the main component of the original ceramsite and amorphous carbon the product of carbon coating modification the characteristic peaks of anatase type tio2 appeared at 2θ 24 54 28 04 36 66 and 54 3 in ti mc1 28 which usually appeared when the calcination temperature was less than 700 c that in this experiment was 550 c the photocatalytic activity was better than that of rutile structure it is beneficial to the combined effect of ozone and ultraviolet process 29 30 the xrd patterns of the catalysts loaded with other metal active components were also shown in fig 2 the corresponding characteristic peaks show that after high temperature activation and calcination the active components were loaded on mc1 in the form of stable oxides which could also be observed in their sem images in fig s1 in supplementary information 3 2 catalytic performance of ti mc1 the catalytic activity of ti catalysts with different carriers mc1 al2o3 activated carbon ac were tested 31 under the condition of the same ozone dosage and catalyst filling rate the pollutant removal effect of different catalysts within 40 min were compared in fig 3 three carriers already had some catalytic activity before loading active components the removal efficiency of tp tn nh3 n and cod was al2o3 mc1 ac the process of ti loading obviously improved the catalytic activity and it could be seen that the removal rates of these pollutants were ti al2o3 ti mc1 ti ac although the catalytic activity of ti mc1 was lower than that of ti al2o3 the cost of mc1 was much lower therefore comprehensive considering the catalytic effect and economic benefits the ti mc1 catalyst had a higher practical value and a wider prospect in order to investigate the catalytic performance the removal efficiency of nh3 n and cod by the catalyst of different active component in wastewater within 60 min were tested under the ozone amount of 5 mg l as shown in fig 4 ti as active component loads were more efficient in contaminant removal performance which were generally superior to those of the catalysts loaded with other metal component even some bimetallic ones this was because the active components of the supported ti can produce more free radicals especially hydroxyl radicals this improved the reaction efficiency of organic matter in the solution and hydroxyl radicals 32 on the other hand filling ratio also affects the activity of the catalyst as shown in fig 5 the removal rates of nh3 n and cod increased with the filling rate of catalyst high filling rate brought more active sites on the catalyst surface which can promote the decomposition of ozone to produce more highly oxidized oh in addition the increase of catalyst filling ratio can improve the contact probability of gas liquid solid phase ozone solution and catalyst to a certain extent however excess filling will inhibit the removal rate because ozone has been fully utilized to convert to oh the amount of catalyst used was reaching saturation 33 take both remove efficiency and economic factors into consideration the catalyst filling rate had been controlled to 40 in this work 3 3 kinetic analysis kinetic analysis was carried out based on the degradation of cod the quasi first order kinetic equation was used to fit the reaction process of three groups the blank group kb mc1 and ti mc1 as shown in fig 6 it could be seen that the three groups of oxidation degradation process were in accord with the quasi first order kinetic equation table 2 listed the kinetic constant of ti mc1 catalyst group was 0 0351 min 1 which was 2 06 and 1 89 times that of kb and mc1 group respectively and the half life of ti mc1 catalyst group was 19 80 min which was significantly lower than the kb 40 77 min and mc1 group 37 26 min the results showed that the addition of ti mc1 catalyst promoted the oxidation reaction the reaction rate was accelerated obviously which proved the good catalytic performance of ti mc1 catalyst in theory 3 4 effect of ultraviolet radiation uv under the action of ultraviolet light ozone can form a variety of active free radicals with strong oxidation in water which would improve the efficiency of water treatment 34 in order to verify the promotion effect of uv the catalytic removal efficiency of cod was tested in black odorous water by ozone with uv and ozone alone as shown in fig 7 it was not difficult to find that the combined catalytic process of ozone uv has the better performance after 30 min the removal rate of cod reached 55 86 based on the ozone uv process which was 21 37 higher than that of ozone alone in addition the degradation of cod by these two processes conforms to the quasi first order chemical kinetics model as shown in fig s2 and table s2 in supplementary information the reaction rate constant of ozone uv was 0 072 min 1 which was 1 41 times that of ozone alone 3 5 purification of black odor waste water 3 5 1 optimization 3 5 1 1 ozone dosage the removal efficiency of nh3 n and cod in water with different dosage of ozone was investigated by the ozone uv process as shown in fig s3 in supplementary information when the dosage of ozone reached to 4 mg l the removal rates of nh3 n and cod were increased to 63 14 and 73 75 at 60 min respectively which were obviously higher than that of 2 mg l ozone when the concentration of ozone in aqueous solution increases within a certain range the mass transfer rate of ozone can be effectively increased however ozone itself was also a scavenger of oh excess ozone molecules in the solution will react each other such a self decomposition would hinder the mineralization of pollutants 35 from fig s3 in supplementary information the removal rate of nh3 n and cod only increased by 6 52 and 7 43 respectively in the range of 4 10 mg l in addition the excessive ozone depends on increasing the inlet air flow rate it not only affected the effective contact between catalyst and pollutants in solution but also reduced the ozone utilization which increase the cost 3 5 1 2 amount of catalyst as shown in fig s4 in supplementary information the removal rates of nh3 n and cod increased with the increase of catalyst dosage when the ozone attached to the surface of metal oxides under weak alkaline conditions it was decomposed to produce hydroxyl radicals oh its strong oxidation could efficiently degrade organic matter 36 when more than 150 g l catalysts added into the system the removal rate of pollutants increased slowly less than 5 on one hand increasing amount of catalyst provided more active sites which enhanced the ability of radical chain reaction to catalyze the decomposition of oh by ozone however the process would be terminated by excess oh because of quench reaction on the other hand too much catalyst will pile up at the bottom of the reactor resulting in the destroy of gas distribution this would affect the uniformity of gas liquid mixing and reduce the gas liquid mass transfer efficiency according to the above analysis the ozone dosage and amount of catalyst were controlled to 4 mg l and 150 g l respectively in the follow up test 3 5 2 catalytic treatment of black odorous wastewater samples under the optimum conditions the removal efficiency of nh3 n and cod in real black odorous wastewater samples were investigated by the prepared ti mc1 catalyst combined with ozone uv process the results were shown in fig 8 by continuous sampling during the period of 0 120 min we could see that the concentration of pollutants in water samples decreased and the corresponding removal rate increased over time the change was larger in the time range of 0 40 min which was leveled off after 40 min the removal rate of nh3 n and cod increased by less than 6 and 3 respectively within 60 120 min which means the reaction was almost completed eventually the removal rates of nh3 n and cod were 72 08 and 80 07 respectively compared with the result in fig 7 the removal rates of cod were nearly 30 higher than that of only ozone advanced oxidation treatment in addition we also studied the stability of the prepared catalyst the same batch of catalysts was used for catalytic ozonation several times in succession the results were shown in fig 9 compared with the fresh catalyst the catalytic activity of the catalyst almost maintained after 1000 min the removal rates of nh3 n and cod decreased by only 4 79 and 4 3 respectively it demonstrated that the catalyst had good stability and low activity attenuation which made it be suitable for using repeatedly fig s5 in supplementary information 3 6 growth stress of constructed technology on submerged macrophytes as an externally imposed means of ecological restoration ozone just like a double edged sword high concentration of ozone will inhibit the growth of aquatic organisms and threaten the river system it was necessary to fully understand its impact on the river ecosystem aquatic plants especially submerged macrophytes play an irreplaceable role in the ecosystem they were the indicator organisms for water quality assessment and subsequent risk assessment the physiological level of submerged macrophytes could more accurately reflect the metabolic level of plants and their response to the environment 37 38 therefore it was important to study the influence of the catalytic treatment of black odor waters by ozone process on submerged macrophytes hornwort 39 40 and green chrysanthemum algae 41 were used as the model submerged macrophytes species fig s6 in supplementary information the stress of the tail water produced by ozone process on their growth was investigated through the response of plant biomass and antioxidant system considered their active oxygen metabolism chlorophyll 42 and soluble protein 43 were selected as the monitoring indexes the growth of submerged macrophytes in the water sample treated by this process was discussed 3 6 1 1 chlorophyll based on the results of six sampling analyses fig 10 the chlorophyll of the two plants showed an upward trend in the range of 0 4 mg l ozone it demonstrated that low concentration of ozone was beneficial to plant growth however the continuously risen ozone concentration was more than 4 mg l the chlorophyll concentration of the two plants decreased obviously from the 6th day high level of ozone hindered the physiological activities of plants 3 6 1 2 soluble protein from fig 11 ozone oxidation inhibited the content of soluble protein in both aquatic plants soluble proteins were proteins that were soluble in water or other solvents as small molecules under rough conditions the plant body mobilizes the self regulating system the change of the metabolic pathway causes the fluctuations of the soluble protein content under the action of ozone the internal soluble protein might degrade itself or broke due to the toxicity of reactive oxygen species 44 the decrease of soluble protein content in the two experimental groups with 6 mg l and 8 mg l of ozone was significantly higher than those in the other groups the physiological activities of plants had been seriously affected it was observed that the optimum ozone concentration 4 mg l in our constructed technology had little effect on the physiological indexes of plants 4 conclusion in this study a stable ti based supported catalyst was fabricated by using the modified waste clay ceramsite combined with the ozone uv technology the catalyst realized effective degradation of pollutants in actual black odor waters compared with catalysts with other carriers or active component the ti mc1 catalyst performed higher activity despite slightly lower activity than al2o3 supported ones this catalyst was environment friendly and low in price as a kind of wastes reuse which made it higher practical value and popularization prospect the surface of the stable ti mc1 catalyst was rough and porous the kinetic analysis showed that the reaction conforms to the quasi first order kinetic equation under the optimum condition of 4 mg l ozone 40 catalyst filling ratio and 150 g l catalyst amount the removal rates of nh3 n and cod could reach 72 08 and 80 07 respectively which were increased by nearly 10 compared with the active carbon supported catalyst in addition by monitoring chlorophyll and soluble protein content of model submerged macrophytes containing hornwort and green chrysanthemum algae during the operation process it could be concluded that the constructed technology will not hinder the normal growth of aquatic organisms in the real water environment under the optimal 4 mg l ozone which confirmed the feasibility of its

13051,black odor water not only completely loses the function but also seriously affects the environment landscape and human health aiming at the problems of high cost and low activity of catalysts for black odor waters treatment by catalytic ozonation technology this paper fabricated a stable ti based supported catalyst using the modified waste clay ceramsite ti mc1 combined with the ozone uv technology this catalyst realized effective degradation of pollutants in actual black odor waters based on the catalytic kinetics analysis it showed that the prepared catalyst performance generally higher activity than those with other carriers or active components as a kind of wastes reuse waste ceramsite is environment friendly with high economic efficiency which gives it higher practical value and popularization prospect under the optimal conditions the removal rates of nh3 n and cod in water have reached 72 08 and 80 07 respectively in addition by monitoring the physiological indexes of representative submerged macrophytes during the operation process it could be concluded that the constructed technology will not hinder the normal growth of aquatic organisms in real water environment which confirms the feasibility of its application the results provided a new idea for the application of nature based processes in aqueous environment management and remediation while also provided a theoretical basis for efficient treatment of black odor waters graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ozone catalytic oxidation ceramsite black odor waters 1 introduction when the water body is seriously polluted the aerobic decomposition of organic matter causes the rate of oxygen consumption to be higher than that of reoxygenation because of the lack of oxygen the incomplete degradation of organic matter with slow rate starts the process of anaerobic biodegradation anaerobic biodegradation produces hydrogen sulfide ammonia mercaptan and other odorous substances and at the same time forms black substance 1 black odor waters is a serious water pollution phenomenon as the water body completely loses the function and will be seriously affects the environment landscape as well as the human health 2 currently the main methods of treating black odor waters are microbial growth promoting method 3 river aeration technology 4 carbon fiber based biofilm carrier technology 5 water ecological purification and pollution control method 6 algae and bacteria treatment method 7 however due to the long repairing cycle these methods can be easily influenced by the season and the content of refractory organic matter in water which limited their application in emergency response therefore an efficient process with low interference and high speed for the treatment of black odorous waterbodies is urgently needed to be developed ozone was used as strong oxidant to degrade the organic matter in the water body either directly or indirectly since ozone was nontoxic harmless and can improve the biodegradability of the treated water body researches showed that the treatment effect of ozone aeration technology was significantly better than that of some conventional aeration not only the concentration of dissolved oxygen in water could be increased greatly 8 and the microbial population was inactivated rapidly in large quantities but also the amount of ozone with less environmental interference can be controlled 9 shen et al used ozonation technology to study the high standard advanced treatment of refractory organic compounds in the secondary effluent from a concentrated sewage treatment in an industrial agglomeration area the results showed that ozone as a pre oxidation measure could greatly improve the biodegradability and enhanced the biodegradation of wastewater 10 however due to the low solubility of ozone in water the utilization ratio of ozone needed to be further improved 11 to this end researchers tried to add catalysts in the ozone oxidation process published research showed that by adding some metal oxides or metal ions as catalysts during the ozonation process ozone decomposition can be promoted to produce oh which improves the ozone utilization rate as well as the reaction process 12 liu et al successfully prepared fe mn ooh catalyst by alkaline coprecipitation method and applied it to ozonation process it was confirmed that the degradation efficiency of this catalytic oxidation technology was higher than that of ozonation alone 13 the most commonly catalysts used in ozonation are carbon based catalysts metal oxides and supported catalysts as one of the most effective catalysts for ozonation the supported catalysts with controlled particle size of active components can enhance the enrichment of ozone and organic compounds on the surface of the catalysts by the loading strategy it can improve the mass transfer and the electron transfer at the micro interface 14 currently the commonly used components include ni fe cu ti etc with respect to degradation rates and the range in contaminants treated bimetals such as nife or pdfe generally outperform unamended granular iron jianming chen and his companions suggested that the use of bimetals in above groundwater treatment applications could become practical with appropriate engineering design 15 however the raw materials of most high efficiency catalyst obtained through specific chemical process the high cost in human and material hinders its large scale popularization and application 16 in recent years the resource utilization of waste not only protected the environment but also saved resources 17 the waste utilization reduced the use of other non renewable resources which was beneficial to the sustainable development of society the waste clay ceramsite as a potential catalyst carrier was eco friendly and cheap compared with activated carbon 18 19 of which the rough surface can increase the contact area between the active components and the substrate 20 herein we used the waste clay ceramsite as basic catalyst carrier combined to the active component ti which possess high catalytic ability the supported ti based catalysts were prepared due to the intense photochemical reaction of ozone under ultraviolet irradiation 21 22 the formation of strong oxidizing oh can be accelerated which further improve the efficiency of pollutant treatment therefore an ozone uv combined process based on ti ceramsite catalyst was developed and subsequently applied to the degradation of pollutants in black odor waters through ozone catalytic oxidation process the catalytic mechanism was elucidated by the characterizations of the micro morphology and crystalline phase of the catalyst as well as the analysis of catalytic kinetics 23 in addition in order to comprehensively evaluate the applying feasibility of this method in real environment the physiological growth indexes of representative aquatic organisms were also monitored during technology operating process 24 25 2 materials and methods 2 1 sources of material the basic waste clay ceramsite were obtained from a building materials market in nanjing the black odor waters sample was taken from the raw river water in the campus of nanjing university of technology the water quality was analyzed as follows cod 60 70 mg l ammonia nitrogen 10 15 mg l ph 6 5 7 5 water temperature 20 25 c activated alumina sodium hydroxide ammonia and other chemical reagents were purchased from nanjing shengqinghe chemical co ltd 2 2 instruments high temperature calcination was finished by muffle furnace model sxqf 5 12 hangzhou blue sky instrument scanning electron microscope images were gained from sem model jeol jsm 6700 japan electronic corporation bet analysis was realized by a specific surface area analyzer model tristar 3020 mcmurray tyco shanghai instrument co ltd x ray diffraction patterns were measured on model xrd 7000 shimadzu company japan ozone was prepared by the generator model jr s10g h nanjing jinren 2 3 catalyst preparation 2 3 1 modification of waste clay ceramsite the original waste clay ceramsite mc0 2 3 mm particle size was modified by hydrothermal method 26 mc0 was immersed in 1 0 mol l 1 hcl and 1 0 mol l 1 naoh for 24 h respectively after being washed and dried mc0 was put into the mixed solution of glucose ferrous ammonium sulfate anhydrous and distilled water at a weight ratio of 2 1 12 followed by being transferred to teflon lined autoclave for solvothermal reaction for 12 h at 180 c the product cooled naturally to room temperature was subsequently washed by ultrapure water the modified waste clay ceramsite mc1 was obtained by drying it at 80 c for 3 h 2 3 2 ti mc1 catalyst preparation ti mc1 catalyst was prepared by sol gel method 27 solution a was composed of anhydrous ethanol hydrochloric acid and deionized water at a volume ratio of 250 5 10 solution b was composed of butyl titanate and anhydrous ethanol at a volume ratio of 100 125 tio2 sol was formed by adding solution a to solution b slowly under continuous stirring subsequently mc1 was soaked in the tio2 sol for 20 min and then washed by ultrapure water the product was dried at 120 c for 72 h and calcined at 550 c for 2 h to obtain ti mc1 catalyst 2 3 3 other catalysts to fabricate other catalysts including fe mc1 fe mn mc1 fe cu mc1 and mn cu mc1 mc1 was immersed in different solution table s1 in supplementary information respectively for 16 h each mixture was stirred continuously for 1 h at the beginning of immersion then the mixture was dried at 120 c for 5 h and baked at 550 c for 5 h 2 4 sewage treatment in order to eliminate the influence of the adsorption of catalyst on the process effect at the beginning of each experiment the reactor was filled with catalyst and raw water successively for 20 min the water sample was discharged when the catalyst was saturated in adsorption then the raw water sample was reinjected into the reactor again typically 1 l water sample was injected into the reactor filled with 150 g l catalyst by peristaltic pump circulating water the ultraviolet lamp was turned on and 4 mg l ozone was fed into the reactor the samples were filtered from the outlet at regular intervals 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the catalysts the surface morphology of the catalyst was observed by sem as shown in fig 1 a the surface of mc0 was rough and irregular which made it had good surface modification condition after modification from the sem photograph of mc1 in fig 1 b it could be seen that the porosity of mc0 was improved the uneven distribution of carbonized particles on the surface was beneficial to the subsequent loading of active components as shown in fig 1 c the surface of ti mc1 was covered by closely packed layers of particles after being loaded with ti in the process of calcination at high temperature metal oxides loaded irregularly on the surface of mc1 which improved the specific surface area and porosity as shown in table 1 it doubtlessly contributed to the contact between the catalyst and the wastewater xrd pattern was employed to analyze the crystal structure of the prepared catalysts fig 2 it could be seen that there was no obvious difference between the characteristic peaks of each ceramsite carrier the sharp characteristic peaks indicated that the chemical components of the catalysts have not changed under long time high temperature calcination as well as the crystal structure which proved its good chemical and structural stability compared with jcpds standard card the typical diffraction peaks of mc1 were corresponded to sio2 the main component of the original ceramsite and amorphous carbon the product of carbon coating modification the characteristic peaks of anatase type tio2 appeared at 2θ 24 54 28 04 36 66 and 54 3 in ti mc1 28 which usually appeared when the calcination temperature was less than 700 c that in this experiment was 550 c the photocatalytic activity was better than that of rutile structure it is beneficial to the combined effect of ozone and ultraviolet process 29 30 the xrd patterns of the catalysts loaded with other metal active components were also shown in fig 2 the corresponding characteristic peaks show that after high temperature activation and calcination the active components were loaded on mc1 in the form of stable oxides which could also be observed in their sem images in fig s1 in supplementary information 3 2 catalytic performance of ti mc1 the catalytic activity of ti catalysts with different carriers mc1 al2o3 activated carbon ac were tested 31 under the condition of the same ozone dosage and catalyst filling rate the pollutant removal effect of different catalysts within 40 min were compared in fig 3 three carriers already had some catalytic activity before loading active components the removal efficiency of tp tn nh3 n and cod was al2o3 mc1 ac the process of ti loading obviously improved the catalytic activity and it could be seen that the removal rates of these pollutants were ti al2o3 ti mc1 ti ac although the catalytic activity of ti mc1 was lower than that of ti al2o3 the cost of mc1 was much lower therefore comprehensive considering the catalytic effect and economic benefits the ti mc1 catalyst had a higher practical value and a wider prospect in order to investigate the catalytic performance the removal efficiency of nh3 n and cod by the catalyst of different active component in wastewater within 60 min were tested under the ozone amount of 5 mg l as shown in fig 4 ti as active component loads were more efficient in contaminant removal performance which were generally superior to those of the catalysts loaded with other metal component even some bimetallic ones this was because the active components of the supported ti can produce more free radicals especially hydroxyl radicals this improved the reaction efficiency of organic matter in the solution and hydroxyl radicals 32 on the other hand filling ratio also affects the activity of the catalyst as shown in fig 5 the removal rates of nh3 n and cod increased with the filling rate of catalyst high filling rate brought more active sites on the catalyst surface which can promote the decomposition of ozone to produce more highly oxidized oh in addition the increase of catalyst filling ratio can improve the contact probability of gas liquid solid phase ozone solution and catalyst to a certain extent however excess filling will inhibit the removal rate because ozone has been fully utilized to convert to oh the amount of catalyst used was reaching saturation 33 take both remove efficiency and economic factors into consideration the catalyst filling rate had been controlled to 40 in this work 3 3 kinetic analysis kinetic analysis was carried out based on the degradation of cod the quasi first order kinetic equation was used to fit the reaction process of three groups the blank group kb mc1 and ti mc1 as shown in fig 6 it could be seen that the three groups of oxidation degradation process were in accord with the quasi first order kinetic equation table 2 listed the kinetic constant of ti mc1 catalyst group was 0 0351 min 1 which was 2 06 and 1 89 times that of kb and mc1 group respectively and the half life of ti mc1 catalyst group was 19 80 min which was significantly lower than the kb 40 77 min and mc1 group 37 26 min the results showed that the addition of ti mc1 catalyst promoted the oxidation reaction the reaction rate was accelerated obviously which proved the good catalytic performance of ti mc1 catalyst in theory 3 4 effect of ultraviolet radiation uv under the action of ultraviolet light ozone can form a variety of active free radicals with strong oxidation in water which would improve the efficiency of water treatment 34 in order to verify the promotion effect of uv the catalytic removal efficiency of cod was tested in black odorous water by ozone with uv and ozone alone as shown in fig 7 it was not difficult to find that the combined catalytic process of ozone uv has the better performance after 30 min the removal rate of cod reached 55 86 based on the ozone uv process which was 21 37 higher than that of ozone alone in addition the degradation of cod by these two processes conforms to the quasi first order chemical kinetics model as shown in fig s2 and table s2 in supplementary information the reaction rate constant of ozone uv was 0 072 min 1 which was 1 41 times that of ozone alone 3 5 purification of black odor waste water 3 5 1 optimization 3 5 1 1 ozone dosage the removal efficiency of nh3 n and cod in water with different dosage of ozone was investigated by the ozone uv process as shown in fig s3 in supplementary information when the dosage of ozone reached to 4 mg l the removal rates of nh3 n and cod were increased to 63 14 and 73 75 at 60 min respectively which were obviously higher than that of 2 mg l ozone when the concentration of ozone in aqueous solution increases within a certain range the mass transfer rate of ozone can be effectively increased however ozone itself was also a scavenger of oh excess ozone molecules in the solution will react each other such a self decomposition would hinder the mineralization of pollutants 35 from fig s3 in supplementary information the removal rate of nh3 n and cod only increased by 6 52 and 7 43 respectively in the range of 4 10 mg l in addition the excessive ozone depends on increasing the inlet air flow rate it not only affected the effective contact between catalyst and pollutants in solution but also reduced the ozone utilization which increase the cost 3 5 1 2 amount of catalyst as shown in fig s4 in supplementary information the removal rates of nh3 n and cod increased with the increase of catalyst dosage when the ozone attached to the surface of metal oxides under weak alkaline conditions it was decomposed to produce hydroxyl radicals oh its strong oxidation could efficiently degrade organic matter 36 when more than 150 g l catalysts added into the system the removal rate of pollutants increased slowly less than 5 on one hand increasing amount of catalyst provided more active sites which enhanced the ability of radical chain reaction to catalyze the decomposition of oh by ozone however the process would be terminated by excess oh because of quench reaction on the other hand too much catalyst will pile up at the bottom of the reactor resulting in the destroy of gas distribution this would affect the uniformity of gas liquid mixing and reduce the gas liquid mass transfer efficiency according to the above analysis the ozone dosage and amount of catalyst were controlled to 4 mg l and 150 g l respectively in the follow up test 3 5 2 catalytic treatment of black odorous wastewater samples under the optimum conditions the removal efficiency of nh3 n and cod in real black odorous wastewater samples were investigated by the prepared ti mc1 catalyst combined with ozone uv process the results were shown in fig 8 by continuous sampling during the period of 0 120 min we could see that the concentration of pollutants in water samples decreased and the corresponding removal rate increased over time the change was larger in the time range of 0 40 min which was leveled off after 40 min the removal rate of nh3 n and cod increased by less than 6 and 3 respectively within 60 120 min which means the reaction was almost completed eventually the removal rates of nh3 n and cod were 72 08 and 80 07 respectively compared with the result in fig 7 the removal rates of cod were nearly 30 higher than that of only ozone advanced oxidation treatment in addition we also studied the stability of the prepared catalyst the same batch of catalysts was used for catalytic ozonation several times in succession the results were shown in fig 9 compared with the fresh catalyst the catalytic activity of the catalyst almost maintained after 1000 min the removal rates of nh3 n and cod decreased by only 4 79 and 4 3 respectively it demonstrated that the catalyst had good stability and low activity attenuation which made it be suitable for using repeatedly fig s5 in supplementary information 3 6 growth stress of constructed technology on submerged macrophytes as an externally imposed means of ecological restoration ozone just like a double edged sword high concentration of ozone will inhibit the growth of aquatic organisms and threaten the river system it was necessary to fully understand its impact on the river ecosystem aquatic plants especially submerged macrophytes play an irreplaceable role in the ecosystem they were the indicator organisms for water quality assessment and subsequent risk assessment the physiological level of submerged macrophytes could more accurately reflect the metabolic level of plants and their response to the environment 37 38 therefore it was important to study the influence of the catalytic treatment of black odor waters by ozone process on submerged macrophytes hornwort 39 40 and green chrysanthemum algae 41 were used as the model submerged macrophytes species fig s6 in supplementary information the stress of the tail water produced by ozone process on their growth was investigated through the response of plant biomass and antioxidant system considered their active oxygen metabolism chlorophyll 42 and soluble protein 43 were selected as the monitoring indexes the growth of submerged macrophytes in the water sample treated by this process was discussed 3 6 1 1 chlorophyll based on the results of six sampling analyses fig 10 the chlorophyll of the two plants showed an upward trend in the range of 0 4 mg l ozone it demonstrated that low concentration of ozone was beneficial to plant growth however the continuously risen ozone concentration was more than 4 mg l the chlorophyll concentration of the two plants decreased obviously from the 6th day high level of ozone hindered the physiological activities of plants 3 6 1 2 soluble protein from fig 11 ozone oxidation inhibited the content of soluble protein in both aquatic plants soluble proteins were proteins that were soluble in water or other solvents as small molecules under rough conditions the plant body mobilizes the self regulating system the change of the metabolic pathway causes the fluctuations of the soluble protein content under the action of ozone the internal soluble protein might degrade itself or broke due to the toxicity of reactive oxygen species 44 the decrease of soluble protein content in the two experimental groups with 6 mg l and 8 mg l of ozone was significantly higher than those in the other groups the physiological activities of plants had been seriously affected it was observed that the optimum ozone concentration 4 mg l in our constructed technology had little effect on the physiological indexes of plants 4 conclusion in this study a stable ti based supported catalyst was fabricated by using the modified waste clay ceramsite combined with the ozone uv technology the catalyst realized effective degradation of pollutants in actual black odor waters compared with catalysts with other carriers or active component the ti mc1 catalyst performed higher activity despite slightly lower activity than al2o3 supported ones this catalyst was environment friendly and low in price as a kind of wastes reuse which made it higher practical value and popularization prospect the surface of the stable ti mc1 catalyst was rough and porous the kinetic analysis showed that the reaction conforms to the quasi first order kinetic equation under the optimum condition of 4 mg l ozone 40 catalyst filling ratio and 150 g l catalyst amount the removal rates of nh3 n and cod could reach 72 08 and 80 07 respectively which were increased by nearly 10 compared with the active carbon supported catalyst in addition by monitoring chlorophyll and soluble protein content of model submerged macrophytes containing hornwort and green chrysanthemum algae during the operation process it could be concluded that the constructed technology will not hinder the normal growth of aquatic organisms in the real water environment under the optimal 4 mg l ozone which confirmed the feasibility of its

13052,the influence of operating parameters i e membrane surface area and water flux and membrane fouling on fo nutrient retention was examined a higher water flux and larger membrane surface area significantly improved total ammonia nitrogen retention owing to the uncoupling of solute and solvent flux and shorter filtration time respectively phosphate retention remained high 95 for all experiments membrane fouling by real sludge centrate feed solution caused significant water flux decline and a reduction in total ammonia nitrogen retention was observed at increasing water recovery organic fouling by sodium alginate and humic acid also caused significant water flux decline and a lower total ammonia nitrogen retention when compared to a pristine membrane at the same draw solution ionic concentration however total ammonia nitrogen retention at the same water flux for a fouled and clean membrane was similar indicating that membrane fouling had minimal direct influence on nutrient transport osmotic backwashing was highly effective in recovering water flux 92 and 85 for model foulant and real sludge centrate fouled membranes respectively however the reverse salt flux of the membrane increased after fouling cleaning indicating possible changes to the membrane integrity keywords forward osmosis membrane fouling nutrient recovery ammonia transport physical cleaning 1 introduction interest in recovering nutrients from wastewater has significantly increased motivated by stringent effluent standards and the anticipated scarcity of natural sources of phosphorus fertilizer 1 2 the increasing demand for recycled wastewater and the desire for improved nutrient management have driven several applications of biological and physiochemical processes for simultaneous wastewater treatment and nutrient recovery 3 4 membrane filtration has been effectively applied in nutrient recovery applications as a robust and promising technology 5 emerging membrane processes including forward osmosis fo have gained significant attention due to several advantages over conventional membrane based wastewater treatment technologies fo is a membrane separation process that uses osmotic pressure as the driving force to draw pure water through a semi permeable membrane fo has a lower fouling potential than reverse osmosis ro 6 7 enabling fo to be used for complex solutions that would otherwise require extensive pre treatment furthermore as a stand alone process fo has a high rejection for most contaminants and hence has been investigated for the treatment of complex solutions in various applications 8 13 consequently fo is considered less energy intensive than ro however an additional draw solute recovery process must be combined with fo to recover fresh water recently fo has been a widely studied technology for nutrient recovery 1 13 17 nutrient recovery is achieved by concentrating nutrients in wastewater to facilitate their subsequent recovery via conventional chemical precipitation techniques in tandem with the concentration of wastewater and nutrients fresh water can be recovered from the draw solution by other techniques such as ro or membrane distillation md 18 there is an increasing body of knowledge devoted to advancing the fo process for nutrient recovery applications 19 20 several researchers have focused on nutrient recovery from varied feed waters such as activated sludge 21 digested sludge centrate 16 22 urine 8 and secondary treated effluent 1 understanding the transport behaviour of nutrients in fo is essential for the success of these applications in general fo has a very high rejection of phosphorus up to 95 99 but a moderate and variable rejection of nitrogen compounds 50 90 14 phosphate is well retained by fo membranes due to its large hydrated radius low diffusion coefficient and negative charge on the other hand nitrogen ammonia and ammonium is smaller highly diffusive and its transport through the fo membrane is influenced by diffusion convection driven by permeation drag and membrane charge 12 24 to achieve electroneutrality ammonium forward solute flux i e feed to draw solution may occur with cation reverse solute flux ammonium might also be co transported with chloride ions from the feed however this is less likely to happen when there is a higher concentration of chloride in the draw solution 25 un charged ammonia having a smaller radius 0 18 nm is more likely to diffuse through the membrane due to the high concentration gradient 12 24 this transport mechanism is enhanced with increasing ph due to the transition of ammonium to ammonia at a ph of 9 25 26 although the effects of ph have been well studied key operational aspects relevant for practical application including filtration time and water flux have been understudied as operating parameters play a significant role in determining ammonia nitrogen transport their optimisation is crucial to improve the potential of fo in nutrient recovery and wastewater treatment applications it is noteworthy that fo has a lower fouling propensity compared to ro however fo membranes are still prone to fouling when filtering complex high nutrient content wastewaters 22 membrane fouling can strongly alter the operational performance and hence solute transport indeed observable changes to nutrient rejection performance during fo process have been previously reported for example in a pilot scale fo study to concentrate wastewater wang et al 27 observed an increase in the ammonium rejection rate with time the authors concluded that the fouling layer hindered the convection of ammonium leading to a reduced concentration at the membrane surface consequently improving rejection similar findings have been reported for the rejection of trace organic contaminants trocs fo membrane rejection against trocs increased as a result of membrane fouling 28 30 therefore understanding the impact of fouling on the nutrient removal of fo membranes is essential for optimising nutrient recovery processes nevertheless there is a lack of studies relating to nutrient removal performance at different operating and fouling conditions in this study the influence of operating parameters i e membrane surface area and water flux and membrane fouling on fo nutrient transport was evaluated the retention of phosphate and total ammonia nitrogen were observed using model foulants and real digested sludge centrate providing insight into fo nutrient recovery applications the impact of the key operating parameters including water flux filtration time effective membrane surface area and feed solution characteristics on nutrient retention was studied membrane fouling was characterised and the effects of fouling and physical cleaning on nutrient retention by fo membrane were also determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 fo membrane a thin film composite tfc polyamide membrane commercially available and supplied by porifera inc was used in this study this asymmetric membrane had an ultra thin polyamide layer coated on top of a porous polysulfone support layer 28 key characteristics of the membrane are shown in table 1 2 2 feed and draw solutions in this study a 1 m sodium chloride nacl draw solution was used for all experiments several feed solutions were used for fo experiments these included a background electrolyte solution model nutrient solution model foulant solution and real digested sludge centrate the background solution was used to simulate the electrolyte characteristics of sludge centrate and contained 1 mm nahco3 2 mm cacl2 2h2o 1 mm mgso4 7h2o and 20 mm nacl in milli q water the nutrient feed solution was prepared by dissolving ammonium chloride nh4cl and sodium dihydrogen phosphate nah2po4 to achieve 400 mg l of total ammonia nitrogen and 200 mg l of phosphate in the background solution the model foulant solutions were prepared using either alginic acid 200 mg l available as sodium alginate humic acid 200 mg l or their combination 100 mg l each a ten fold concentrated stock solution of alginate and humic acid was prepared prior to the experiments and stored in a sterilised amber glass bottle at 4 c for use in all experiments within a month all chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from sigma aldrich real digested sludge centrate obtained from a full scale wastewater treatment plant in wollongong was also used in fouling experiments as the feed solution instead of the model foulants a magnetic stirrer was used for mixing all feed solutions during the experiments the key characteristics of the feed and draw solutions are shown in table 2 2 3 forward osmosis system a cross flow membrane cell with an effective membrane surface area of 50 cm2 10 cm 5 cm consisting of two identical semi cells was used for this lab scale study the flat sheet membrane was placed between two rubber gaskets inside the perspex semi cells and diamond shaped ro spacers from a commercially available ro membrane module were placed at either side of the membrane cell to improve flow dynamics a larger membrane cell with an effective area of 125 cm2 16 cm 8 cm was also employed in this study the channel depth for both membrane cells was 2 mm the fo setup included two adjustable speed gear pumps micropump vancouver washington usa for draw and feed circulation and were regulated by flowmeters at a flowrate of 1 l min fig 1 the draw solution beaker was placed on a digital measuring balance mettler toledo inc hightstown new jersey usa connected to a computer to measure the weight changes and to calculate water flux conductivity of the draw solution was continuously measured using a conductivity probe cole parmer vernon hills illinois usa connected to a conductivity controller specified range 0 1 ms cm and peristaltic pump this set up maintained the draw solution conductivity at 1m nacl by dosing a 5m nacl solution hence controlling the osmotic pressure of the draw solution for all experiments transport of ions from the feed solution to the draw solution had negligible influence on the draw solution conductivity for the duration of the experiments the concentrated nacl solution was placed in a 500 ml beaker on the same balance as the draw solute beaker to eliminate any weight changes due to replenishment of draw solution 2 4 experimental protocols all the experiments were conducted using a cross flow membrane cell with pumps circulating both feed and draw solution with a flowrate of 1 l min for all experiments the membrane was positioned with the active layer facing the feed solution al fs the ph and conductivity of the feed solution was measured hourly and 20 ml samples were collected throughout the experiments initial samples were collected 5 min after the start of the experiment and final samples were collected 5 min before the end of experiment to ensure homogeneity at the start and end of all experiments a clear water test was conducted with 2 l milli q water as the feed and 1 m nacl as the draw solution to verify membrane integrity to investigate the influence of operating conditions nutrient retention was measured using two different membrane surface areas at varying water flux each experiment was conducted for the duration corresponding to 50 water recovery at an average water flux of 15 l m2 h 0 3 m nacl and 25 l m2 h 1 m nacl the fouling experiments ran in the following series after the clear water test the milli q feed was replaced with the 2 l background solution and the water flux was allowed to stabilise for 1 h after 1 h model foulant stock solution was added to the feed tank and the system was operated for 20 h to artificially foul the membrane next the foulant feed solution was replaced with a 2 l nutrient feed immediately after the fouling experiment and the experiment was continued until 1 l of water permeated to the draw side in this way nutrient removal by fouled membrane was assessed using the same water flux conditions at the end of the fouling experiment a pristine pre wetted membrane was then evaluated to determine the nutrient retention in the absence of fouling the feed and draw solutions were prepared using analytical grade solutes and the solute concentrations were chosen to imitate that of digested sludge centrate in the feed solution the concentration of draw solute i e 1 m was selected to achieve the approximate osmotic pressure similar to ro brine a potential low cost draw solution source real digested sludge centrate was used in raw as well as filtered and centrifuged form as the feed 2 l with 1 m nacl as the draw solution 2 l the digested sludge centrate was filtered using 20 μm filter paper and subsequently put in centrifuge allegra x 12r beckman coulter fullerton ca for 15 min at 5250 g at 20 c to remove any large particulate matter membrane integrity test and water flux recoverability experiments were performed using 2 l milli q water as the feed and 2 l nacl 1 m as the draw solution osmotic backwashing was performed for 30 min by reversing the position of the membrane cell 32 such that the active layer faced the draw solution 1 m nacl and the support layer faced the feed solution milli q water 2 5 nutrient transport calculations the retention r of nutrients by the fo system was calculated using eq 1 whereby c i and c f are the initial and final concentrations of nutrients in the feed respectively while v f and v i are the initial and final feed volume of the feed solution respectively this formula considers the nutrient concentration factor within the feed solution and is independent of time and other factors to provide an overall retention value for any volume of permeate and corresponding concentrations of nutrients 1 r 1 c i v f v i c f c i 100 the determination of nutrient retention was also verified by eq 2 derived from a mass balance to incorporate the nutrient concentration in the draw solution where c i fs and c f ds are the initial and final concentration of nutrients in the feed and draw solution respectively while v i fs and v f ds are the corresponding solution volumes the nutrient retention was calculated at various water recoveries to account for any variation in nutrient flux during experiments 2 r 1 v f ds c f ds v i fs c i fs 100 2 6 analytical

operating parameters on nutrient retention the water flux and membrane surface area significantly influenced total ammonia nitrogen retention during fo filtration of the model nutrient solution fig 2a all experiments were conducted for the duration corresponding to 50 water recovery at an average water flux of 15 l m2 h 0 3 m nacl and 25 l m2 h 1 m nacl the results indicate that total ammonia nitrogen retention improved at a higher water flux this improvement was observed for both membrane sizes whereby total ammonia nitrogen retention increased by 23 and 16 for the 50 cm2 and 125 cm2 membrane areas respectively in the al fs orientation a higher water flux dilutes the total ammonia nitrogen concentration at the interface of the active layer and support layer i e permeate concentration thereby resulting in a lower rate of solute transport toward the draw solution resulting in higher retention this diffusion mechanism involving the uncoupling of solute and solvent flux has been previously reported for fo nitrogen rejection 8 the nutrient retention was also evaluated at a constant water flux and water recovery for the two different membrane surface areas irrespective of the applied water flux total ammonia nitrogen retention by the larger membrane was significantly higher fig 2a at 15 l m2 h a 31 increase in ammonia retention was achieved by using a larger membrane surface area while a 25 increase was observed at 25 l m2 h it is important to mention that all experiments were run at 50 water recovery and the solution ph remained close to 7 throughout the experiments therefore the observed increase in total ammonia nitrogen retention for the larger membrane surface area was likely due to the shorter filtration time needed to achieve the target water recovery a similar trend was reported by vu et al 33 who concluded that increasing the membrane surface area and shortening the filtration time can improve ammonia enrichment in the feed solution engelhardt et al 34 also reported better nitrogen rejection with decreasing filtration time in shorter duration experiments there is less time for ammonia to establish chemical equilibrium between the feed and draw solutions hence leading to a lower diffusion and accumulation of ammonia in the draw solution as a result the permeate volume per unit membrane surface area vp am should be a key consideration for fo process evaluation particularly for nutrient recovery applications overall a larger membrane surface area and higher water flux significantly improved ammonia retention owing to the shorter filtration time it is noteworthy that total ammonia nitrogen retention was significantly lower compared to phosphate fig 2 nitrogen transported in fo membranes is influenced by several factors including concentration gradient driven diffusion convection driven by permeation drag and electrostatic interactions 12 24 35 it is important to mention that at lower ph almost all of the total ammonia nitrogen exists as ammonium ions and the transition to ammonia occurs at ph 9 25 therefore in these experiments most of the total ammonia nitrogen existed as ammonium ions as the ph remained below 7 therefore facilitating their permeation through the tfc membrane given its negative surface charge 25 phosphate was successfully retained 95 by the tfc membrane and was minimally influenced by fo operating parameters i e water flux and membrane surface area fig 2b solute rejection by semi permeable membranes is primarily governed by steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion between the solute molecules and membrane 1 hence the higher retention of phosphate compared to ammonium was expected due to the negative charge and higher molecular weight of phosphate ions compared to ammonium phosphate has a larger hydrated radius and a smaller diffusion coefficient i e 0 44 10 9 m2 s vs 1 96 10 9 m2 s limiting its transport across the membrane 36 the active layer of the tfc membrane is also negatively charged and favours the rejection of phosphate ions as a result of electrostatic repulsion 29 similar high rejections of phosphate have been reported by several researchers when concentrating wastewaters such as digested sludge centrate 22 urine 8 municipal wastewater 1 and anaerobically treated dairy manure 37 3 2 influence of membrane fouling on nutrient retention 3 2 1 nutrient retention performance with model foulants the nutrient retention as a function of water recovery with and without the model foulants in the nutrient feed solution is shown in fig 3a minimal variation in phosphate retention was observed however the retention of total ammonia nitrogen varied significantly throughout the experiment in both conditions the retention of total ammonia nitrogen decreased with increasing water recovery solute transport is driven by the concentration gradient that exists between the al fs interface and the draw solution 12 24 this means that at a higher concentration gradient more total ammonia nitrogen will diffuse through the membrane because these were batch experiments with continuous concentration of the feed solution the increasing ammonia concentration in feed might have resulted in this declining trend the feed side nitrogen concentration increases while at the draw solution side the permeating water swiftly carries away diffused ammonia nitrogen thus no significant impact of internal concentration polarisation icp is seen on forward ammonia flux 8 to achieve chemical equilibrium higher amount of ammonium ammonia need to diffuse to the draw side with increasing feed concentration engelhardt et al 34 observed a similar declining trend of urea rejection with increasing water recovery it was hypothesised that rejection is influenced by increasing nutrient concentration in the feed and dilution of the draw side by the permeating water thus it can be stated that the extent of water recovery i e concentration factor significantly influences the retention of total ammonia nitrogen the difference in total ammonia retention between the experiments with and without model foulants widened with increasing water recovery fig 3a at the start of the experiment the difference in retention was only 3 while at a high water recovery i e 70 the difference increased to 15 as discussed in section 3 1 ammonia transport is highly influenced by the water flux and the fouled system experienced significant water flux decline over the experimental period fig 3b the initial flux for both experiments was 25 l m2 h but at the end of experiment i e at 70 water recovery the water flux decline for the foulant free feed solution was minimal and only reduced to 22 5 l m2 h due to volume reduction and enrichment of solutes in the feed solution in contrast the water flux of the model foulants reduced to 11 l m2 h this indicates the formation of a cake layer on the membranes surface resulting in cake enhanced concentration polarisation whereby the net osmotic driving force is reduced 6 8 in short according to the solution diffusion model a higher water flux lowers the overall solute transport hence increasing the solute rejection the solvent flux and solute flux are uncoupled and increasing solvent flux diminishes the forward solute flux 38 therefore it is possible that membrane fouling indirectly caused a lower ammonia retention due to the reduction of water flux in effect the operating parameter with significant influence on nitrogen ammonia retention is filtration time 3 2 2 analysis of foulant type on nutrient retention at constant water flux to further examine the influence of membrane fouling on nutrient retention a series of experiments were conducted to isolate the influence of water flux at the same initial flux the membrane was fouled using model foulants in 2 l of background solution as feed for the duration corresponding to 50 water recovery then the foulant feed was replaced with the model nutrient solution in the absence of any foulant in 2 l of background solution to evaluate nutrient retention of the fouled membrane a pristine membrane was also analysed for nutrient recovery by adjusting the draw solute concentration to match the water flux of the fouled membrane during the model nutrient experiment different combinations of organic foulants were investigated and the extent of membrane fouling did not appear to strongly influence nutrient retention at the same water flux fig 4 phosphate retention was consistently high 95 while total ammonia retention was approximately 50 for all conditions no discernible differences were observed between the pristine and fouled membrane conditions sodium alginate and humic acid also showed similar results however the ammonia retention for the combination of sodium alginate and humic acid was slightly lower than other foulants this variation is likely due to the slightly different water fluxes experienced at the conclusion of the fouling experiment 11 l m2 h vs 15 l m2 h and the longer filtration duration required to reach 50 water recovery fig 4 this confirms that water flux and filtration time plays an important role in the overall retention of ammonia in other words the extent of fouling observed in this study did not appear to hinder solute convection as was observed in a previous study 27 instead the fouling layer contributes to significant water flux decline due to decreased osmotic pressure at the membrane surface and under these conditions the fouling layer itself has poor selectivity and does not influence nutrient permeability sodium alginate and humic acid consist of biopolymers and large humic substances and these results indicate that fouling structure was not compact enough to influence nutrient retention behaviour via concentration polarisation interestingly the opposite effect of membrane fouling was observed by wang et al 27 in a pilot scale fo study to concentrate wastewater they observed significant changes in nutrient rejection including an increase in the ammonium rejection rate with time the authors concluded that the fouling layer hindered the convection of ammonium more so than diffusion leading to a reduced concentration at the membrane surface consequently improving rejection 27 this cake reduced concentration polarisation phenomenon was not observed in this study and is likely attributed to differences in the feed solution constituents and the operational duration it can be hypothesised that the complexity of the feed solution and longer operational duration developed a more complex and compact fouling layer 3 3 impact of fouling on water flux different organic foulants caused a notably different flux decline profile as shown in fig 5 the most severe fouling was observed for sodium alginate when present alone at 200 mg l and when mixed with humic acid at both 100 and 200 mg l fouling initiates due to the adsorption of sodium alginate onto the membrane surface followed by development of a cross linked alginate gel layer due to intermolecular bridging caused by the presence of ca2 ions 80 mg l in the feed solution 7 28 in contrast for humic acid 200 mg l the flux declined more steadily however at 70 water recovery the normalised flux was similar to that of other conditions it is likely that in the absence of sodium alginate humic acid built up gradually on the membrane surface gradually making a cohesive and compact fouling layer 39 40 also humic acid does not exhibit the unique gel forming mechanism like sodium alginate 41 a baseline experiment was also conducted with no foulant added to the background solution to differentiate the flux decline caused by fouling and the reduction of osmotic driving force due to the concentration of feed solutes in the absence of organic foulants there was small reduction in water flux i e 15 over the experimental duration this indicates that most of the observed flux decline was due to fouling hence for all model foulants the flux decline can be attributed to membrane fouling due to a build up of organic foulants on the surface sem analysis of the fouled membranes fig 6b d showed that when the synthetic feed composed of organic foulants sodium alginate and or humic acid was used a dense layer of foulant completely covered the membrane surface in comparison to the virgin membrane fig 6a this was expected because the tfc membrane has carboxylic functional groups on its surface which are highly polar and have considerably high affinity to organic foulants in the feed solution 42 it should be noted that the carboxylic groups of sodium alginate in the foulant feed solution would have been deprotonated at the feed s ambient ph of 6 8 however as a result of complexation of alginate with divalent cations such as ca2 intermolecular bridging and charge minimisation occurred this caused agglomeration of alginate molecules which formed a gel layer upon deposition on the membrane surface 42 deposition of ca na mg and cl was observed on the surface of the fouled membranes during eds analysis fig s1 in supplementary data a higher weight percent of ca was detected on all fouled membranes analysed which indicates the role of calcium to facilitate formation of intermolecular bridges with organic foulants thus causing the formation of a cake layer and exacerbating fouling 6 28 sem analysis of the fouled membranes fig 6b d showed that when the synthetic feed composed of organic foulants sodium alginate and or humic acid was used a dense layer of foulant completely covered the membrane surface in comparison to the virgin membrane fig 6a this was expected because the tfc membrane has carboxylic functional groups on its

intermolecular bridges with organic foulants thus causing the formation of a cake layer and exacerbating fouling 6 28 3 4 strategies to reduce fo fouling and flux decline 3 4 1 pre treatment of digested sludge centrate the water flux profiles for the raw and filtered sludge centrate are shown in fig 7 there was no significant difference in the fouling trend meaning that pre treatment via filtration and centrifugation to remove suspended solids may be ineffective to reduce fo fouling during filtration of digested sludge centrate in both cases the flux declined rapidly at the start which indicates significant deposition of particles forming a cake layer on the membrane surface 43 polyamide membranes have adhesive sites on their surface which cause foulants to adhere and form a cake layer resulting in severe fouling in the initial stage 43 44 this cake layer resulted in severe cake enhanced concentration polarisation causing a drastic decrease in osmotic pressure at the membrane al fs interface indeed fouling plays a vital role in flux decline due to hydraulic resistance from the cake layer as well as cake enhanced concentration polarisation 45 membrane fouling during the filtration of sludge centrate is ascribed to its high mineral ca and mg and solids content 46 the cake enhanced concentration polarisation phenomena is also aggravated due to concentration of the feed 14 as the major constituents in centrate are enriched phosphate 90 ammonia nitrogen 50 80 total dissolved organics 97 by the membrane however it is also noteworthy that flux decline under these conditions was caused by mainly fouling the water recovery was only 21 which caused only a slight increase in feed osmotic pressure as the conductivity increased from 5 7 ms cm to 7 3 ms cm 3 4 2 physical cleaning water flux recoverability after fouling of the tfc membranes following 18 h of operation with sodium alginate or sludge centrate as feed solution was systematically investigated when sludge centrate was used as feed the membrane fouled rapidly compared to the synthetic feed flux declined rapidly from 23 l m2 h to 2 l m2 h in just 7 h after the start of the experiment as seen in fig 8a after the fouling experiments were completed membrane flushing was performed as a physical cleaning technique to determine flux recovery the feed solution was replaced with 2 l milli q water and circulated at 2 l min flowrate corresponding to a cross flow velocity of 30 cm s for 30 min only 15 water flux was recovered for the sludge centrate fouled membrane due to the severity of fouling the water flux recovery by membrane flushing was 65 for the membrane using model foulants better recovery of water flux in case of the model solution fouled membrane can be attributed to a comparatively loose fouling layer structure as suggested in the literature the deposition of inorganic precipitates on the surface of a membrane combined with organic fouling causes a highly compact and cohesive fouling layer when sludge centrate is used as feed 13 precipitation can also occur on the membrane surface if the conditions are favourable sludge centrate has high phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations along with significant amount of magnesium to favour formation of inorganic precipitates similar fouling trends were observed by vu et al 33 while using sludge centrate as feed high cross flow velocity flushing intends to physically remove foulant due to high shear force 46 however this typical anti fouling strategy was ineffective in recovering water flux 3 4 3 osmotic backwashing osmotic backwashing fig 8b was performed by reversing the draw solution and feed solution such that the membrane active layer faced the draw solution rather than feed solution milli q was used as feed solution and 1 m nacl as a draw solution for a duration of 30 min for osmotic backwashing 85 and 92 flux were recovered in 30 min of backwash for centrate and model solution fouled membrane respectively the reverse permeation of water weakened the attachment of the cake layer and the high crossflow velocity swept away the foulants into the bulk solution our observation is in line with that of previous studies regarding the effectiveness of osmotic backwash in recovering flux of fo membrane following fouling 32 47 49 although there was significant recovery of water flux there were still remnants of fouling layer adhered to the membrane surface as observed visually these foulants were lodged under the spacer filaments and could not be removed probably due to being trapped in hydrodynamic dead zones which occur near the spacer mesh elements 50 51 preferential particle accumulation occurs in these dead flow regions and foulants are trapped due to lack of mobility unaffected by the tangential drag force a higher water flux recovery might be achieved by improving spacer designs or increasing the duration and intensity of cleaning studies by motsa et al 48 and kim et al 32 suggest that foulant type membrane orientation and backwash conditions such as cleaning duration and initial flux play an important role in determining cleaning efficiency integrity tests were performed after the osmotic backwashing experiments to investigate any effects on membrane performance total organic carbon toc i e 98 and phosphate retention i e 95 remained high after fouling and osmotic backwashing as shown in fig 9 an increase in reverse solute flux was observed after the osmotic backwashing the increased reverse solute flux may be due to salt accumulation in the remnants of fouling layer during the cleaning experiments when the salt solution was in contact with the active layer and may have subsequently contaminated the feed solution during the integrity test on the other hand it is more likely that the salt rejection capability of the membrane was altered as a result of membrane degradation caused by fouling maltos et al 52 observed a similar increase in reverse solute flux after long term operation of fo and linked it to membrane degradation they speculated that the interaction between the membrane surface and the organic constituents in the feed solution also causing fouling might have degraded the membrane and compromised its salt rejection ability bell et al 53 also observed elevated reverse solute flux after long duration fo operation and streaming potential analysis of membrane samples indicated that the membrane became increasingly more negatively charged this was probably the reason for the increased reverse solute flux in their experiments 53 although the measured reverse solute flux of the membrane increased after the fouling and osmotic backwashing experiments the retention of total ammonia nitrogen was comparable to the initial condition since the integrity tests were performed at the same water flux fig 9 interestingly ammonium transport can be linked to reverse solute flux and can be driven by the counter diffusion of na ions to maintain solution electroneutrality reverse solute flux kedwell et al 25 reported that increasing reverse solute flux and ph caused a decline in total ammonia retention however the effects of reverse solute flux alone were not clarified based on the results of this study it is likely that ph plays a more significant role in this phenomenon or the effect of reverse solute flux is minimal at neutral ph the observed difference between the total ammonia nitrogen retention of the model foulants and digested sludge centrate can again be explained by the effects of water flux ammonia transport as shown in fig 9 water flux decline for centrate was rapid and a total water recovery of 20 was achieved compared with 50 for the model foulant solution hence the rejection of total ammonia nitrogen was higher for sludge centrate as the experimental duration was shorter 4 conclusion several key aspects of nutrient retention by tfc fo membrane were analysed in this study total ammonia nitrogen transport was found to be highly dependent on operating conditions a larger membrane surface area i e smaller permeate volume per unit membrane surface area and higher water flux significantly improved ammonia retention while phosphate was consistently retained more than 95 for example when the membrane surface area was 125 cm2 the total ammonia nitrogen retention increased by 16 as a result of increasing the water flux from 15 l m2 h to 25 l m2 h and shorter filtration time the permeate volume per unit membrane area should be a key consideration for fo process evaluation particularly for nutrient recovery applications a declining trend of total ammonia nitrogen retention was observed with increasing water recovery most likely due to the enrichment of the feed solution over time organic fouling by sodium alginate and humic acid caused significant flux decline and caused a lower total ammonia nitrogen retention when compared to a clean membrane at the same draw solution ionic concentration however total ammonia nitrogen transport at same flux for a fouled and clean membrane was similar indicating that the presence of membrane fouling had minimal influence on nutrient transport osmotic backwashing was highly effective in recovering flux in a short duration 30 min of cleaning however the reverse salt flux of the membrane increased after fouling cleaning indicating changes to the membrane integrity the following are the supplementary data related to this article fig s1 sem and eds results of a virgin membrane and three membranes fouled with b sodium

13052,the influence of operating parameters i e membrane surface area and water flux and membrane fouling on fo nutrient retention was examined a higher water flux and larger membrane surface area significantly improved total ammonia nitrogen retention owing to the uncoupling of solute and solvent flux and shorter filtration time respectively phosphate retention remained high 95 for all experiments membrane fouling by real sludge centrate feed solution caused significant water flux decline and a reduction in total ammonia nitrogen retention was observed at increasing water recovery organic fouling by sodium alginate and humic acid also caused significant water flux decline and a lower total ammonia nitrogen retention when compared to a pristine membrane at the same draw solution ionic concentration however total ammonia nitrogen retention at the same water flux for a fouled and clean membrane was similar indicating that membrane fouling had minimal direct influence on nutrient transport osmotic backwashing was highly effective in recovering water flux 92 and 85 for model foulant and real sludge centrate fouled membranes respectively however the reverse salt flux of the membrane increased after fouling cleaning indicating possible changes to the membrane integrity keywords forward osmosis membrane fouling nutrient recovery ammonia transport physical cleaning 1 introduction interest in recovering nutrients from wastewater has significantly increased motivated by stringent effluent standards and the anticipated scarcity of natural sources of phosphorus fertilizer 1 2 the increasing demand for recycled wastewater and the desire for improved nutrient management have driven several applications of biological and physiochemical processes for simultaneous wastewater treatment and nutrient recovery 3 4 membrane filtration has been effectively applied in nutrient recovery applications as a robust and promising technology 5 emerging membrane processes including forward osmosis fo have gained significant attention due to several advantages over conventional membrane based wastewater treatment technologies fo is a membrane separation process that uses osmotic pressure as the driving force to draw pure water through a semi permeable membrane fo has a lower fouling potential than reverse osmosis ro 6 7 enabling fo to be used for complex solutions that would otherwise require extensive pre treatment furthermore as a stand alone process fo has a high rejection for most contaminants and hence has been investigated for the treatment of complex solutions in various applications 8 13 consequently fo is considered less energy intensive than ro however an additional draw solute recovery process must be combined with fo to recover fresh water recently fo has been a widely studied technology for nutrient recovery 1 13 17 nutrient recovery is achieved by concentrating nutrients in wastewater to facilitate their subsequent recovery via conventional chemical precipitation techniques in tandem with the concentration of wastewater and nutrients fresh water can be recovered from the draw solution by other techniques such as ro or membrane distillation md 18 there is an increasing body of knowledge devoted to advancing the fo process for nutrient recovery applications 19 20 several researchers have focused on nutrient recovery from varied feed waters such as activated sludge 21 digested sludge centrate 16 22 urine 8 and secondary treated effluent 1 understanding the transport behaviour of nutrients in fo is essential for the success of these applications in general fo has a very high rejection of phosphorus up to 95 99 but a moderate and variable rejection of nitrogen compounds 50 90 14 phosphate is well retained by fo membranes due to its large hydrated radius low diffusion coefficient and negative charge on the other hand nitrogen ammonia and ammonium is smaller highly diffusive and its transport through the fo membrane is influenced by diffusion convection driven by permeation drag and membrane charge 12 24 to achieve electroneutrality ammonium forward solute flux i e feed to draw solution may occur with cation reverse solute flux ammonium might also be co transported with chloride ions from the feed however this is less likely to happen when there is a higher concentration of chloride in the draw solution 25 un charged ammonia having a smaller radius 0 18 nm is more likely to diffuse through the membrane due to the high concentration gradient 12 24 this transport mechanism is enhanced with increasing ph due to the transition of ammonium to ammonia at a ph of 9 25 26 although the effects of ph have been well studied key operational aspects relevant for practical application including filtration time and water flux have been understudied as operating parameters play a significant role in determining ammonia nitrogen transport their optimisation is crucial to improve the potential of fo in nutrient recovery and wastewater treatment applications it is noteworthy that fo has a lower fouling propensity compared to ro however fo membranes are still prone to fouling when filtering complex high nutrient content wastewaters 22 membrane fouling can strongly alter the operational performance and hence solute transport indeed observable changes to nutrient rejection performance during fo process have been previously reported for example in a pilot scale fo study to concentrate wastewater wang et al 27 observed an increase in the ammonium rejection rate with time the authors concluded that the fouling layer hindered the convection of ammonium leading to a reduced concentration at the membrane surface consequently improving rejection similar findings have been reported for the rejection of trace organic contaminants trocs fo membrane rejection against trocs increased as a result of membrane fouling 28 30 therefore understanding the impact of fouling on the nutrient removal of fo membranes is essential for optimising nutrient recovery processes nevertheless there is a lack of studies relating to nutrient removal performance at different operating and fouling conditions in this study the influence of operating parameters i e membrane surface area and water flux and membrane fouling on fo nutrient transport was evaluated the retention of phosphate and total ammonia nitrogen were observed using model foulants and real digested sludge centrate providing insight into fo nutrient recovery applications the impact of the key operating parameters including water flux filtration time effective membrane surface area and feed solution characteristics on nutrient retention was studied membrane fouling was characterised and the effects of fouling and physical cleaning on nutrient retention by fo membrane were also determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 fo membrane a thin film composite tfc polyamide membrane commercially available and supplied

phosphate nah2po4 to achieve 400 mg l of total ammonia nitrogen and 200 mg l of phosphate in the background solution the model foulant solutions were prepared using either alginic acid 200 mg l available as sodium alginate humic acid 200 mg l or their combination 100 mg l each a ten fold concentrated stock solution of alginate and humic acid was prepared prior to the experiments and stored in a sterilised amber glass bottle at 4 c for use in all experiments within a month all chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from sigma aldrich real digested sludge centrate obtained from a full scale wastewater treatment plant in wollongong was also used in fouling experiments as the feed solution instead of the model foulants a magnetic stirrer was used for mixing all feed solutions during the experiments the key characteristics of the feed and draw solutions are shown in table 2 2 3 forward osmosis system a cross flow membrane cell with an effective membrane surface area of 50 cm2 10 cm 5 cm consisting of two identical semi cells was used for this lab scale study the flat sheet membrane was placed between two rubber gaskets inside the perspex semi cells and diamond shaped ro spacers from a commercially available ro membrane module were placed at either side of the membrane cell to improve flow dynamics a larger membrane cell with an effective area of 125 cm2 16 cm 8 cm was also employed in this study the channel depth for both membrane cells was 2 mm the fo setup included two adjustable speed gear pumps micropump vancouver washington usa for draw and feed circulation and were regulated by flowmeters at a flowrate of 1 l min fig 1 the draw solution beaker was placed on a digital measuring balance mettler toledo inc hightstown new jersey usa connected to a computer to measure the weight changes and to calculate water flux conductivity of the draw solution was continuously measured using a conductivity probe cole parmer vernon hills illinois usa connected to a conductivity controller specified range 0 1 ms cm and peristaltic pump this set up maintained the draw solution conductivity at 1m nacl by dosing a 5m nacl solution hence controlling the osmotic pressure of the draw solution for all experiments transport of ions from the feed solution to the draw solution had negligible influence on the draw solution conductivity for the duration of the experiments the concentrated nacl solution was placed in a 500 ml beaker on the same balance as the draw solute beaker to eliminate any weight changes due to replenishment of draw solution 2 4 experimental protocols all the experiments were conducted using a cross flow membrane cell with pumps circulating both feed and draw solution with a flowrate of 1 l min for all experiments the membrane was positioned with the active layer facing the feed solution al fs the ph and conductivity of the feed solution was measured hourly and 20 ml samples were collected throughout the experiments initial samples were collected 5 min after the start of the experiment and final samples were collected 5 min before the end of experiment to ensure homogeneity at the start and end of all experiments a clear water test was conducted with 2 l milli q water as the feed and 1 m nacl as the draw solution to verify membrane integrity to investigate the influence of operating conditions nutrient retention was measured using two different membrane surface areas at varying water flux each experiment was conducted for the duration corresponding to 50 water recovery at an average water flux of 15 l m2 h 0 3 m nacl and 25 l m2 h 1 m nacl the fouling experiments ran in the following series after the clear water test the milli q feed was replaced with the 2 l background solution and the water flux was allowed to stabilise for 1 h after 1 h model foulant stock solution was added to the feed tank and the system was operated for 20 h to artificially foul the membrane next the foulant feed solution was replaced with a 2 l nutrient feed immediately after the fouling experiment and the experiment was continued until 1 l of water permeated to the draw side in this way nutrient removal by fouled membrane was assessed using the same water flux conditions at the end of the fouling experiment a pristine pre wetted membrane was then evaluated to determine the nutrient retention in the absence of fouling the feed and draw solutions were prepared using analytical grade solutes and the solute concentrations were chosen to imitate that of digested sludge centrate in the feed solution the concentration of draw solute i e 1 m was selected to achieve the approximate osmotic pressure similar to ro brine a potential low cost draw solution source real digested sludge centrate was used in raw as well as filtered and centrifuged form as the feed 2 l with 1 m nacl as the draw solution 2 l the digested sludge centrate was filtered using 20 μm filter paper and subsequently put in centrifuge allegra x 12r beckman coulter fullerton ca for 15 min at 5250 g at 20 c to remove any large particulate matter membrane integrity test and water flux recoverability experiments were performed using 2 l milli q water as the feed and 2 l nacl 1 m as the draw solution osmotic backwashing was performed for 30 min by reversing the position of the membrane cell 32 such that the active layer faced the draw solution 1 m nacl and the support layer faced the feed solution milli q water 2 5 nutrient transport calculations the retention r of nutrients by the fo system was calculated using eq 1 whereby c i and c f are the initial and final concentrations of nutrients in the feed respectively while v f and v i are the initial and final feed volume of the feed solution respectively this formula considers the nutrient concentration factor within the feed solution and is independent of time and other factors to provide an overall retention value for any volume of permeate and corresponding concentrations of nutrients 1 r 1 c i v f v i c f c i 100 the determination of nutrient retention was also verified by eq 2 derived from a mass balance to incorporate the nutrient concentration in the draw solution where c i fs and c f ds are the initial and final concentration of nutrients in the feed and draw solution respectively while v i fs and v f ds are the corresponding solution volumes the nutrient retention was calculated at various water recoveries to account for any variation in nutrient flux during experiments 2 r 1 v f ds c f ds v i fs c i fs 100 2 6 analytical

operating parameters on nutrient retention the water flux and membrane surface area significantly influenced total ammonia nitrogen retention during fo filtration of the model nutrient solution fig 2a all experiments were conducted for the duration corresponding to 50 water recovery at an average water flux of 15 l m2 h 0 3 m nacl and 25 l m2 h 1 m nacl the results indicate that total ammonia nitrogen retention improved at a higher water flux this improvement was observed for both membrane sizes whereby total ammonia nitrogen retention increased by 23 and 16 for the 50 cm2 and 125 cm2 membrane areas respectively in the al fs orientation a higher water flux dilutes the total ammonia nitrogen concentration at the interface of the active layer and support layer i e permeate concentration thereby resulting in a lower rate of solute transport toward the draw solution resulting in higher retention this diffusion mechanism involving the uncoupling of solute and solvent flux has been previously reported for fo nitrogen rejection 8 the nutrient retention was also evaluated at a constant water flux and water recovery for the two different membrane surface areas irrespective of the applied water flux total ammonia nitrogen retention by the larger membrane was significantly higher fig 2a at 15 l m2 h a 31 increase in ammonia retention was achieved by using a larger membrane surface area while a 25 increase was observed at 25 l m2 h it is important to mention that all experiments were run at 50 water recovery and the solution ph remained close to 7 throughout the experiments therefore the observed increase in total ammonia nitrogen retention for the larger membrane surface area was likely due to the shorter filtration time needed to achieve the target water recovery a similar trend was reported by vu et al 33 who concluded that increasing the membrane surface area and shortening the filtration time can improve ammonia enrichment in the feed solution engelhardt et al 34 also reported better nitrogen rejection with decreasing filtration time in shorter duration experiments there is less time for ammonia to establish chemical equilibrium between the feed and draw solutions hence leading to a lower diffusion and accumulation of ammonia in the draw solution as a result the permeate volume per unit membrane surface area vp am should be a key consideration for fo process evaluation particularly for nutrient recovery applications overall a larger membrane surface area and higher water flux significantly improved ammonia retention owing to the shorter filtration time it is noteworthy that total ammonia nitrogen retention was significantly lower compared to phosphate fig 2 nitrogen transported in fo membranes is influenced by several factors including concentration gradient driven diffusion convection driven by permeation drag and electrostatic interactions 12 24 35 it is important to mention that at lower ph almost all of the total ammonia nitrogen exists as ammonium ions and the transition to ammonia occurs at ph 9 25 therefore in these experiments most of the total ammonia nitrogen existed as ammonium ions as the ph remained below 7 therefore facilitating their permeation through the tfc membrane given its negative surface charge 25 phosphate was successfully retained 95 by the tfc membrane and was minimally influenced by fo operating parameters i e water flux and membrane surface area fig 2b solute rejection by semi permeable membranes is primarily governed by steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion between the solute molecules and membrane 1 hence the higher retention of phosphate compared to ammonium was expected due to the negative charge and higher molecular weight of phosphate ions compared to ammonium phosphate has a larger hydrated radius and a smaller diffusion coefficient i e 0 44 10 9 m2 s vs 1 96 10 9 m2 s limiting its transport across the membrane 36 the active layer of the tfc membrane is also negatively charged and favours the rejection of phosphate ions as a result of electrostatic repulsion 29 similar high rejections of phosphate have been reported by several researchers when concentrating wastewaters such as digested sludge centrate 22 urine 8 municipal wastewater 1 and anaerobically treated dairy manure 37 3 2 influence of membrane fouling on nutrient retention 3 2 1 nutrient retention performance with model foulants the nutrient retention as a function of water recovery with and without the model foulants in the nutrient feed solution is shown in fig 3a minimal variation in phosphate retention was observed however the retention of total ammonia nitrogen varied significantly throughout the experiment in both conditions the retention of total ammonia nitrogen decreased with increasing water recovery solute transport is driven by the concentration gradient that exists between the al fs interface and the draw solution 12 24 this means that at a higher concentration gradient more total ammonia nitrogen will diffuse through the membrane because these were batch experiments with continuous concentration of the feed solution the increasing ammonia concentration in feed might have resulted in this declining trend the feed side nitrogen concentration increases while at the draw solution side the permeating water swiftly carries away diffused ammonia nitrogen thus no significant impact of internal concentration polarisation icp is seen on forward ammonia flux 8 to achieve chemical equilibrium higher amount of ammonium ammonia need to diffuse to the draw side with increasing feed concentration engelhardt et al 34 observed a similar declining trend of urea rejection with increasing water recovery it was hypothesised that rejection is influenced by increasing nutrient concentration in the feed and dilution of the draw side by the permeating water thus it can be stated that the extent of water recovery i e concentration factor significantly influences the retention of total ammonia nitrogen the difference in total ammonia retention between the experiments with and without model foulants widened with increasing water recovery fig 3a at the start of the experiment the difference in retention was only 3 while at a high water recovery i e 70 the difference increased to 15 as discussed in section 3 1 ammonia transport is highly influenced by the water flux and the fouled system experienced significant water flux decline over the experimental period fig 3b the initial flux for both experiments was 25 l m2 h but at the end of experiment i e at 70 water recovery the water flux decline for the foulant free feed solution was minimal and only reduced to 22 5 l m2 h due to volume reduction and enrichment of solutes in the feed solution in contrast the water flux of the model foulants reduced to 11 l m2 h this indicates the formation of a cake layer on the membranes surface resulting in cake enhanced concentration polarisation whereby the net osmotic driving force is reduced 6 8 in short according to the solution diffusion model a higher water flux lowers the overall solute transport hence increasing the solute rejection the solvent flux and solute flux are uncoupled and increasing solvent flux diminishes the forward solute flux 38 therefore it is possible that membrane fouling indirectly caused a lower ammonia retention due to the reduction of water flux in effect the operating parameter with significant influence on nitrogen ammonia retention is filtration time 3 2 2 analysis of foulant type on nutrient retention at constant water flux to further examine the influence of membrane fouling on nutrient retention a series of experiments were conducted to isolate the influence of water flux at the same initial flux the membrane was fouled using model foulants in 2 l of background solution as feed for the duration corresponding to 50 water recovery then the foulant feed was replaced with the model nutrient solution in the absence of any foulant in 2 l of background solution to evaluate nutrient retention of the fouled membrane a pristine membrane was also analysed for nutrient recovery by adjusting the draw solute concentration to match the water flux of the fouled membrane during the model nutrient experiment different combinations of organic foulants were investigated and the extent of membrane fouling did not appear to strongly influence nutrient retention at the same water flux fig 4 phosphate retention was consistently high 95 while total ammonia retention was approximately 50 for all conditions no discernible differences were observed between the pristine and fouled membrane conditions sodium alginate and humic acid also showed similar results however the ammonia retention for the combination of sodium alginate and humic acid was slightly lower than other foulants this variation is likely due to the slightly different water fluxes experienced at the conclusion of the fouling experiment 11 l m2 h vs 15 l m2 h and the longer filtration duration required to reach 50 water recovery fig 4 this confirms that water flux and filtration time plays an important role in the overall retention of ammonia in other words the extent of fouling observed in this study did not appear to hinder solute convection as was observed in a previous study 27 instead the fouling layer contributes to significant water flux decline due to decreased osmotic pressure at the membrane surface and under these conditions the fouling layer itself has poor selectivity and does not influence nutrient permeability sodium alginate and humic acid consist of biopolymers and large humic substances and these results indicate that fouling structure was not compact enough to influence nutrient retention behaviour via concentration polarisation interestingly the opposite effect of membrane fouling was observed by wang et al 27 in a pilot scale fo study to concentrate wastewater they observed significant changes in nutrient rejection including an increase in the ammonium rejection rate with time the authors concluded that the fouling layer hindered the convection of ammonium more so than diffusion leading to a reduced concentration at the membrane surface consequently improving rejection 27 this cake reduced concentration polarisation phenomenon was not observed in this study and is likely attributed to differences in the feed solution constituents and the operational duration it can be hypothesised that the complexity of the feed solution and longer operational duration developed a more complex and compact fouling layer 3 3 impact of fouling on water flux different organic foulants caused a notably different flux decline profile as shown in fig 5 the most severe fouling was observed for sodium alginate when present alone at 200 mg l and when mixed with humic acid at both 100 and 200 mg l fouling initiates due to the adsorption of sodium alginate onto the membrane surface followed by development of a cross linked alginate gel layer due to intermolecular bridging caused by the presence of ca2 ions 80 mg l in the feed solution 7 28 in contrast for humic acid 200 mg l the flux declined more steadily however at 70 water recovery the normalised flux was similar to that of other conditions it is likely that in the absence of sodium alginate humic acid built up gradually on the membrane surface gradually making a cohesive and compact fouling layer 39 40 also humic acid does not exhibit the unique gel forming mechanism like sodium alginate 41 a baseline experiment was also conducted with no foulant added to the background solution to differentiate the flux decline caused by fouling and the reduction of osmotic driving force due to the concentration of feed solutes in the absence of organic foulants there was small reduction in water flux i e 15 over the experimental duration this indicates that most of the observed flux decline was due to fouling hence for all model foulants the flux decline can be attributed to membrane fouling due to a build up of organic foulants on the surface sem analysis of the fouled membranes fig 6b d showed that when the synthetic feed composed of organic foulants sodium alginate and or humic acid was used a dense layer of foulant completely covered the membrane surface in comparison to the virgin membrane fig 6a this was expected because the tfc membrane has carboxylic functional groups on its surface which are highly polar and have considerably high affinity to organic foulants in the feed solution 42 it should be noted that the carboxylic groups of sodium alginate in the foulant feed solution would have been deprotonated at the feed s ambient ph of 6 8 however as a result of complexation of alginate with divalent cations such as ca2 intermolecular bridging and charge minimisation occurred this caused agglomeration of alginate molecules which formed a gel layer upon deposition on the membrane surface 42 deposition of ca na mg and cl was observed on the surface of the fouled membranes during eds analysis fig s1 in supplementary data a higher weight percent of ca was detected on all fouled membranes analysed which indicates the role of calcium to facilitate formation of intermolecular bridges with organic foulants thus causing the formation of a cake layer and exacerbating fouling 6 28 sem analysis of the fouled membranes fig 6b d showed that when the synthetic feed composed of organic foulants sodium alginate and or humic acid was used a dense layer of foulant completely covered the membrane surface in comparison to the virgin membrane fig 6a this was expected because the tfc membrane has carboxylic functional groups on its surface which are highly polar and have considerably high affinity to organic foulants in the feed solution 42 it should be noted that the carboxylic groups of sodium alginate in the foulant feed

intermolecular bridges with organic foulants thus causing the formation of a cake layer and exacerbating fouling 6 28 3 4 strategies to reduce fo fouling and flux decline 3 4 1 pre treatment of digested sludge centrate the water flux profiles for the raw and filtered sludge centrate are shown in fig 7 there was no significant difference in the fouling trend meaning that pre treatment via filtration and centrifugation to remove suspended solids may be ineffective to reduce fo fouling during filtration of digested sludge centrate in both cases the flux declined rapidly at the start which indicates significant deposition of particles forming a cake layer on the membrane surface 43 polyamide membranes have adhesive sites on their surface which cause foulants to adhere and form a cake layer resulting in severe fouling in the initial stage 43 44 this cake layer resulted in severe cake enhanced concentration polarisation causing a drastic decrease in osmotic pressure at the membrane al fs interface indeed fouling plays a vital role in flux decline due to hydraulic resistance from the cake layer as well as cake enhanced concentration polarisation 45 membrane fouling during the filtration of sludge centrate is ascribed to its high mineral ca and mg and solids content 46 the cake enhanced concentration polarisation phenomena is also aggravated due to concentration of the feed 14 as the major constituents in centrate are enriched phosphate 90 ammonia nitrogen 50 80 total dissolved organics 97 by the membrane however it is also noteworthy that flux decline under these conditions was caused by mainly fouling the water recovery was only 21 which caused only a slight increase in feed osmotic pressure as the conductivity increased from 5 7 ms cm to 7 3 ms cm 3 4 2 physical cleaning water flux recoverability after fouling of the tfc membranes following 18 h of operation with sodium alginate or sludge centrate as feed solution was systematically investigated when sludge centrate was used as feed the membrane fouled rapidly compared to the synthetic feed flux declined rapidly from 23 l m2 h to 2 l m2 h in just 7 h after the start of the experiment as seen in fig 8a after the fouling experiments were completed membrane flushing was performed as a physical cleaning technique to determine flux recovery the feed solution was replaced with 2 l milli q water and circulated at 2 l min flowrate corresponding to a cross flow velocity of 30 cm s for 30 min only 15 water flux was recovered for the sludge centrate fouled membrane due to the severity of fouling the water flux recovery by membrane flushing was 65 for the membrane using model foulants better recovery of water flux in case of the model solution fouled membrane can be attributed to a comparatively loose fouling layer structure as suggested in the literature the deposition of inorganic precipitates on the surface of a membrane combined with organic fouling causes a highly compact and cohesive fouling layer when sludge centrate is used as feed 13 precipitation can also occur on the membrane surface if the conditions are favourable sludge centrate has high phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations along with significant amount of magnesium to favour formation of inorganic precipitates similar fouling trends were observed by vu et al 33 while using sludge centrate as feed high cross flow velocity flushing intends to physically remove foulant due to high shear force 46 however this typical anti fouling strategy was ineffective in recovering water flux 3 4 3 osmotic backwashing osmotic backwashing fig 8b was performed by reversing the draw solution and feed solution such that the membrane active layer faced the draw solution rather than feed solution milli q was used as feed solution and 1 m nacl as a draw solution for a duration of 30 min for osmotic backwashing 85 and 92 flux were recovered in 30 min of backwash for centrate and model solution fouled membrane respectively the reverse permeation of water weakened the attachment of the cake layer and the high crossflow velocity swept away the foulants into the bulk solution our observation is in line with that of previous studies regarding the effectiveness of osmotic backwash in recovering flux of fo membrane following fouling 32 47 49 although there was significant recovery of water flux there were still remnants of fouling layer adhered to the membrane surface as observed visually these foulants were lodged under the spacer filaments and could not be removed probably due to being trapped in hydrodynamic dead zones which occur near the spacer mesh elements 50 51 preferential particle accumulation occurs in these dead flow regions and foulants are trapped due to lack of mobility unaffected by the tangential drag force a higher water flux recovery might be achieved by improving spacer designs or increasing the duration and intensity of cleaning studies by motsa et al 48 and kim et al 32 suggest that foulant type membrane orientation and backwash conditions such as cleaning duration and initial flux play an important role in determining cleaning efficiency integrity tests were performed after the osmotic backwashing experiments to investigate any effects on membrane performance total organic carbon toc i e 98 and phosphate retention i e 95 remained high after fouling and osmotic backwashing as shown in fig 9 an increase in reverse solute flux was observed after the osmotic backwashing the increased reverse solute flux may be due to salt accumulation in the remnants of fouling layer during the cleaning experiments when the salt solution was in contact with the active layer and may have subsequently contaminated the feed solution during the integrity test on the other hand it is more likely that the salt rejection capability of the membrane was altered as a result of membrane degradation caused by fouling maltos et al 52 observed a similar increase in reverse solute flux after long term operation of fo and linked it to membrane degradation they speculated that the interaction between the membrane surface and the organic constituents in the feed solution also causing fouling might have degraded the membrane and compromised its salt rejection ability bell et al 53 also observed elevated reverse solute flux after long duration fo operation and streaming potential analysis of membrane samples indicated that the membrane became increasingly more negatively charged this was probably the reason for the increased reverse solute flux in their experiments 53 although the measured reverse solute flux of the membrane increased after the fouling and osmotic backwashing experiments the retention of total ammonia nitrogen was comparable to the initial condition since the integrity tests were performed at the same water flux fig 9 interestingly ammonium transport can be linked to reverse solute flux and can be driven by the counter diffusion of na ions to maintain solution electroneutrality reverse solute flux kedwell et al 25 reported that increasing reverse solute flux and ph caused a decline in total ammonia retention however the effects of reverse solute flux alone were not clarified based on the results of this study it is likely that ph plays a more significant role in this phenomenon or the effect of reverse solute flux is minimal at neutral ph the observed difference between the total ammonia nitrogen retention of the model foulants and digested sludge centrate can again be explained by the effects of water flux ammonia transport as shown in fig 9 water flux decline for centrate was rapid and a total water recovery of 20 was achieved compared with 50 for the model foulant solution hence the rejection of total ammonia nitrogen was higher for sludge centrate as the experimental duration was shorter 4 conclusion several key aspects of nutrient retention by tfc fo membrane were analysed in this study total ammonia nitrogen transport was found to be highly dependent on operating conditions a larger membrane surface area i e smaller permeate volume per unit membrane surface area and higher water flux significantly improved ammonia retention while phosphate was consistently retained more than 95 for example when the membrane surface area was 125 cm2 the total ammonia nitrogen retention increased by 16 as a result of increasing the water flux from 15 l m2 h to 25 l m2 h and shorter filtration time the permeate volume per unit membrane area should be a key consideration for fo process evaluation particularly for nutrient recovery applications a declining trend of total ammonia nitrogen retention was observed with increasing water recovery most likely due to the enrichment of the feed solution over time organic fouling by sodium alginate and humic acid caused significant flux decline and caused a lower total ammonia nitrogen retention when compared to a clean membrane at the same draw solution ionic concentration however total ammonia nitrogen transport at same flux for a fouled and clean membrane was similar indicating that the presence of membrane fouling had minimal influence on nutrient transport osmotic backwashing was highly effective in recovering flux in a short duration 30 min of cleaning however the reverse salt flux of the membrane increased after fouling cleaning

consist of more than one aromatic ring 1 3 many studies have considered pahs carcinogenic teratogenic mutagenic toxic and resistive to the natural biodegradation processes making them detrimental to the environment and aquatic systems 2 4 7 pahs are also classified based on the number of aromatic rings in their molecular structure and molecular weight with two or three aromatic rings pahs are

as polluting pah sources and atmospheric deposition 21 24 as non point polluting sources shen et al reported that globally 504 gigagram gg of the most harmful sixteen pahs were released into the

motor vehicles petroleum consumption 12 8 25 fig 1 moreover atmospheric deposition influences more than 80 of the pahs present in the environment 26 the global pahs emissions peaked at 592 gg in 1995 then progressively dropped to 499 gg in 2008 based on the six ipcc sres scenarios pahs emissions in developed and developing nations would drop by 46 71 and 48 64 respectively from 2009 to 2030 25 wang et al on the other hand looked at yearly pahs emissions over mainland china yearly emissions decreased from 112 92 gg to 100 09 gg during 2013 2017 27 tsiodra et al studied the seasonal concentrations of pahs in the greater athens area regions in southern europe from 2016 to 2018 the mean pahs concentrations in winter 2016 2017 spring 2017 summer 2017 autumn 2017 and winter 2017 2018

a south african province 30 and h yuan et al 753 ng l in china s yellow river delta 31 major contributors of the pah to the yellow river s wuhai waters are coal combustion 35 and vehicle emissions 34 29 most pahs sources are found near the urban areas and cause a higher concentration than the rural settlement pahs in vapor and solid phases in the atmosphere adsorb on the particulate matter surface in the presence of sunlight adsorbed pahs undergo photo oxidation which results in their chemical breakdown 14 studies have observed that pahs toxicity increases in ultraviolet light whereas metabolism and photo oxidation suppress the toxicity of pahs pahs have mild to acute toxic effects on the birds and aquatic life albers reported a higher concentration of pahs in fish and shellfish than in surroundings due to bioaccumulation although terrestrial invertebrates also showed bioaccumulation of pahs no poisonous impact has been documented 32 the metabolism of pahs may inhibit bioaccumulation 33 pah generated phytotoxic effects are rare certain plants synthesize the pahs that act as growth hormones and the remaining plants contain some substances that can protect them against the adverse impacts of pahs 34 inhalation ingestion and dermal contact of pahs adversely affect reproduction development and immunity and cause tumors 34 the united states environmental

potential technique for treating pahs cost effectively and sustainably 21 56 57 therefore various studies are conducted to find the most efficient and economically feasible adsorbent and parameters affecting the pahs removal process 58 63 however limited research has been available about the adsorption media used to remove pahs from aqueous solutions and the factors that influence their efficiency this paper encapsulates various studies on removing pahs and outlines the merits and demerits of different pahs removal processes the primary objective of this review is to describe recent literature on pahs removal via adsorption a comprehensive discussion on the specific adsorption mechanism of various adsorbents and the operating parameters that determine the adsorption process and efficiency is provided in the review paper 2 pahs removal techniques conventional processes for pahs removal from wastewater include physical chemical adsorption aerobic anaerobic biodegradation processes biological processes and their combinations 7 64 66 these processes have various limitations such as complex processes high investment and maintenance costs many processes release by products that are mutagenic and carcinogenic 67 70 as a result the search for more alternative techniques appears to be never ending the advantages and disadvantages of various pahs removal techniques have been summarized in table 2 only a few have been demonstrated commercially among all the widely available wastewater treatment technologies applicable for pahs removal since 1992 condorchem envitech has been using various techniques such as reverse osmosis nanofiltration bioaugmentation coagulation flocculation direct filtration and adsorption to treat drinking and industrial wastewater at commercial scales 84 due to high operating costs advanced oxidation catalytic degradation and bioremediation have not yet been commercialized for field industrial scale water treatment despite being proven effective and thriving in the laboratory non commercialization is due to the complexity of incorporating these techniques into current water treatment systems or scaling them up to handle large quantities of water 76 adsorption is the most widely used technique for wastewater treatment using a wide range of products from gac 85 silver impregnated coconut ac ag gac 66 86 to pac from wood and coal 2 1 pahs removal using adsorption adsorption is a very efficient technique for extracting organic contaminants including pahs from wastewater 87 the adsorption process offers numerous advantages such as eco friendly energy efficient high temperature applicability and economical adsorbents produced from agricultural residue industrial solid waste and mineral deposits 56 88 89 the techno economic feasibility of the adsorption process is influenced by the type of adsorbent and adsorbate and process parameters most pahs removal technologies rely on the hydrophobicity of material which is responsible for interfacial adsorption to absorb pahs molecules in this context eeshwarasinghe et al employed gac to scavenge pahs molecules from wastewater which required a few hours to remove pahs by gac 90 in recent years many studies have shown the development of specialized pahs removal techniques with removal occurring by intercalation π π bonding and inclusion complexation adsorption using adsorbents such as bc and ac has been reported as an effective approach for removing pahs from an aqueous solution in the literature 21 89 91 therefore adsorption gives a better option for converting waste into value added products to sustain the environment 2 2 pahs adsorption at pilot and industrial scale municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been the primary pah repositories heavy rains often wash these pollutants from soil or have been directly released from petroleum treatment plants petrochemicals coal mining and manufacturing industries several investigations have found that these contaminants have been present in significantly higher concentrations than the permitted level as a result wwt systems have been developed for industrial and urban stations 92 ac is most commonly used for the after treatment of non significant toxins such as pahs in wwtps because of its homogeneous surface microspores and increased contact surface area 93 researchers used the accessibility of several economic and extremely permeable adsorbent media to examine adsorbent removals of pahs in pilot and industrial plants kalmykova et al investigated sand gacs and peat moss fillers for pilot plant pah adsorption and reported that 50 63 pahs removal was achieved from peat and gac 94 gonzalez et al studied the removal of pahs by membrane bioreactor mbr at the pilot scale and concluded that the pahs removal efficiency depends on various properties of pahs lmw pahs phe were removed more easily as compared to hmw fl 95 likewise gong et al studied lab scale pahs adsorption using activated carbon from vegetable oil to ascertain pahs contaminated oil regeneration they inferred that ac dosage and pahs initial concentration affected the adsorption significantly 96 furthermore ilyas et al utilized ac from waste polyethylene terephthalate wpet ac and waste polystyrene wps ac to remove toxic pahs from water at pilot scale according to the results when compared to wps ac wpet ac had a greater ability to absorb the 16 pahs listed in table 1 the adsorption percentage of the 16 pahs varied from 53 80 92 44 in the case of wpet ac 97 3 adsorption media for pahs removal this section includes an extensive review of recent studies on pahs adsorption using various porous carbonaceous materials such as biochar 1 98 ac 57 99 cnts 80 81 and porous non carbonaceous adsorbents databases including scopus sciencedirect scifinder and web of science were used to search the literature the literature for this study was selected based on relevancy substance publication year and keywords some of the keywords used to discover literature included activated carbon biochar cnts graphene pahs adsorption pahs removal methods biochar process parameters and adsorption process parameters research and review papers conference proceedings thesis books and book chapters relevant to each subsidiary ac bc for pahs adsorption variables affecting adsorption process adsorption isotherms were chosen after carefully examining the aim and contents for the present study a total of 206 shortlisted papers were extensively reviewed to extract essential information the literature included in the present study was published between 2019 and 21 40 42 2015 18 38 829 and 2006 10 20 744 fig 2 depicts the number of papers using a particular adsorbent for the pah removal over the last 10 years the ac has been the most widely used among the adsorbents nearly 50 of the studies followed by bc and other adsorbents the pahs removal mechanism using these adsorbents has been discussed in later sections 3 1 biochar organic materials such as agricultural and forest residues and municipal solid wastes pyrolyzed in the temperature range of 300 700 c under an oxygen limited environment produce biochar 102 105 the hydrophobicity surface chemistry surface area porous structure and pore size of biochar significantly influence its adsorption capacity 1 106 108 pahs adsorption using biochar is based on pore filling hydrophobic impact electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonding and precipitation mechanism the physicochemical properties of biochar such as dose pyrolysis temperature and medium ph are the influential factors for pahs adsorption 109 113 the pahs molecules diffuse into the pores of the biochar s uncarbonized section where they can interact directly with pahs and cause adsorption 114 pahs polarity and the nature and type of biochar influence their adsorption an essential mechanism for pahs adsorption onto biochar s surface is electrostatic interaction biochar s ability to attract or repel any organic contaminant including pahs is influenced by the solution s ionic strength and the ph 109 115 the adsorption of aromatic compounds like pahs on biochar is mainly due to electron donor and acceptor interaction 117 biochar s electron density to generate deficient or enriched π electron is however dependent on the pyrolysis temperature if the temperature is 500 c the biochar s aromaticity acts as an electron acceptor whereas biochar acts as a donor if the temperature is 500 c 116 118 guo et al prepared magnetically modified biochar mbc from rice husk to remove phe from aqueous solutions and reported 97 6 mg g phe adsorption capacity higher than other biochar obtained from different feedstocks 1 jesus et al investigated the removal efficiency of pahs using coconut waste derived biochar the removal efficiency reported was 81 73 78 51 and 81 97 for b a a b k f and b a p respectively 119 similarly godlewska et al observed high adsorption capacity for phe and pyr using biochar produced from sewage sludge 120 also liu et al achieved the adsorption capacity of nap as 384 mg l using poplar catkins biochar 121 li et al studied the removal efficiency of pahs using biochar made from wheat straw at different temperatures 400 600 and 800 c the removal efficiency increased from 71 to 98 6 with the rise in pyrolysis temperature reflecting a linear trend 61 the increase in removal efficiency might increase the biochar s hydrophobic nature and aromaticity resulting in π π enhancement and increased hydrophobic interactions between the biochar surface and the pahs in agreement with this study chen et al used pine needles derived biochar at different temperatures 250 700 c for removing nap and achieved 136 8 mg g maximum adsorption at 700 c 122 researchers have observed a non linear relationship between biochar adsorption capacity and its production temperature which could be due to the breaking of ester groups and the aliphatic alkyl with an increase in temperature 62 63 moreover a rise in pyrolysis temperature improved the biochar surface area leading to increased active sites for adsorption ding et al revealed that the total surface area of the adsorbent was linearly related to pyrolysis temperature resulting in higher adsorption capacity as temperature rises 123 3 2 activated carbon due to its substantial internal ssa and elaborated porous structure ac is widely used for removing organic contaminants including pahs from aqueous solutions ac could adsorb low concentration pollutants efficiently making it a suitable adsorbent for pahs adsorption 124 126 ac could be produced from carbonaceous materials such as bituminous coal 127 petroleum coke 128 sewage sludge 129 plant based material 130 the residues undergo the process of carbonization followed by activation functional group interactions vander waals force interactions π π interactions and hydrogen bonding at the adsorbent surface are the primary cause for the adsorption 132 also the chemical characteristics of ac could be altered easily through chemical treatment 133 ge et al modified the ac produced from coal for pyrene adsorption from aqueous solution using ammonia treatment a cac microwave radiation m cac and microwave radiation combined with ammonia ma cac they inferred that the moderation improved the surface area of the adsorbents as well as pore volume they observed that the bet surface area of the adsorbents increased from 764 96 cac 1293 78 m2 g ma cac 134 danish and ahmad conducted a review on ac production as an adsorbent material from wood biomass they reported that surface area and ac s pore size were the major contributing factors to pahs adsorption 135 surface functional groups containing oxygen carboxyl phenols carbonyl lactones quinones and sulfhydryl and amino groups could be the main drivers for pollutant interaction with ac their presence has a significant impact on pahs removal efficiency alves et al investigated the effectiveness of sugarcane straw ac scac as an adsorbent for pahs removal from wastewater the study concluded that scac had superior adsorption capability to commercial carbon samples 136 according to the kinetics study carbon generated from residual biomass scac performs similarly to commercial aac emphasizing that the textural features are significant in pahs adsorption eeshwarasinghe et al showed langmuir adsorption capabilities of acy 0 31 2 63 mg g and phe 0 74 7 36 mg g using gac as adsorbent 90 rinawati et al research suggested rhac for eliminating pahs phe and fl from the aquatic environment the adsorption capacities of phe and fl were reported to be 98 99 and 50 respectively 57 as shown in table 3 similar work was conducted by rasheed et al pahs removal efficiency reported was 99 using pac as adsorbent 60 as demonstrated in table 4 ac properties vary with their activation process parameters such as activating agent process temperature and flow rate of an oxidizing agent ac with different adsorption capacities could be produced from the same feedstock 23 137 yuan et al showed that pahs adsorption capacity increases by changing the koh activating agent and coke ratio during the activation of carbon from petroleum coke 23 likewise h kong et al illustrated that the pah adsorption capacity of ac produced from soybean stalk increases with increased temperature as mentioned in table 4 higher adsorption capacity can be attributed to a hike in ssa with the rise in temperature 137 when the carbonization temperature was raised from 300 to 600 c during the process of nap adsorption the minimum removal efficiency of the flamboyant pod s ac f ac and the milk bush kernel shell ac mb ac rose from 1 28 to 1 49 mg g and 1 20 to 1 41 mg g respectively and the maximum removal efficiency rose from 3 99 to 4 39 mg g and 3 27 to 3 94 mg g 138 as mentioned in table 5 a similar pattern was observed when 139 studied ant adsorption using f ac and mb ac maximum removal efficiency increased from 58 65 65 39 and 54 48 58 75 for flamboyant pod back and milk bush kernel shells respectively as the carbonization temperature increased from 300 to 600 c for the gaseous phase compared to standard gases vaporous pahs with greater molecular weights and lower volatility provide entirely different adsorption forms e g a better affinity to pores and a significant adsorption potential at very low concentrations more significant molecular sizes of pahs do not favor adsorbent pore s mass transfer and diffusion within adsorbing pores significantly decreasing adsorption speeds moreover the sturdy interactions between pahs and adsorbents which in practical applications contribute to increased energy consumption in temperature swing adsorption processes need a much higher thermal desorption temperature for adsorption ac showed improved removal efficiency and reduced equilibrium time for pahs adsorption compared to bc the most probable cause could be the higher porosity of ac bc has a lower cost of production and consumes less activation energy than ac 61 pahs adsorption happens due to the π π electron and hydrogen bonding sites of the adsorbent surface porous properties can be changed to increase removal capacities by modifying the surface of ac and bc besides this modifications also stabilize the adsorbents 3 3 carbon nanotubes cnts other than bc and ac cnts are among the most employed adsorbents for pahs removal from wastewater the chemical and thermal stability of cnts is very high also it has a surface area comparable to bc and ac which makes it suitable for pahs adsorption compared to other carbonaceous materials it has been acknowledged for superior chemical and physical properties 147 148 modified surface properties permit it to associate with organic contaminants through the various non covalent and covalent bond formations cnts are formed when 2 dimensional 2d carbon atoms sheets in hexagonal shape are rolled into a tube generating a tube type structure the physicochemical characteristics of cnts are determined by the different combinations with which graphene sheets are rolled the atomic configurations of graphene sheets influences the length and diameter of cnts 149 cnts have been widely researched for their application to remove organic pollutants such as pahs from wastewater 100 150 151 cnts and ac have comparable morphologies in terms of structure also both can be chemically changed 152 high water permeability due to high ssa and large ratio of accessible micropores 153 make cnts a suitable adsorbent for pahs adsorption the ssa and chemical functional groups on the surface have an impact on the adsorption process efficiency 101 these parameters must be modified to maximize the sites for adsorption on cnts 154 zhang et al prepared a magnetic composite of mwcnt swcnt with iron oxide for the adsorption of phe from water a higher adsorption capacity was found in the magnetic composite as compared to swcnt and mwcnt individually further cnts magnetization increased removal efficiency and ease in regeneration and adsorbents re useability 59 the hydrophobic electrostatic π π stacking vander waals forces of interaction and hydrogen bonding are the primary mechanism for pahs adsorption over cnts 155 3 4 graphene graphene is a 2d carbon sheet with hexagonally arranged carbon atoms with each atom closely packed to other atoms as cnts are a rolled version of the graphene sheet the interaction of graphene with pahs is the same as that in the case of cnts such as hydrogen bonding π π and electrostatic interactions 156 the π π bond forms between the benzene ring present on the surface of graphene nanosheets gns and the carbon double bond of pahs molecule 157 the benefit of gns over other carbon based materials is the strong connection between oc molecules and the open up layer graphene surface via π π interaction 158 159 the large ssa of graphene contributes to its high adsorption capacity by creating many binding sites 160 wang et al investigated the graphene gns and graphene oxide go nanosheet s ability to adsorb nap phe and pyr the conclusion was that graphene had a high affinity towards pahs 161 similarly 95 and 60 nap removal efficiencies were obtained using rgo and go respectively 143 besides bai et al used tio2 graphene composites for pahs adsorption and achieved re of 80 58 furthermore jun wang chen studied the adsorption of nap using arg go and crg the maximum adsorption achieved with go crg arg was 21 52 145 mg g respectively 142 table 4 shows that the adsorption capacity of phe and pyr was obtained at 5 mg g and 20 mg g respectively using graphene wool as an adsorbent 144 compared to go and rgo graphene was shown to have greater adsorption capability in most instances go has more functional groups containing oxygen and electron density lower than rgo the hydrophobic effects of organic pollutants were shown to cause their enhanced absorption on graphene molecules which occurs due to π π interactions 162 the dense carbonyl groups present at the surface of the carbon layers were responsible for the significant adsorption of organic contaminants including pahs onto the material s surface via electrostatic anion π interactions and hydrogen bonding in the case of go 92 163 3 5 other adsorbents for pahs adsorption various studies have been directed at using non carbonaceous materials such as chitosan mesoporous silica molecularly imprinted polymers metal organic frameworks and similar composite materials as adsorbents for the removal of pahs these materials out perform carbon based materials like ac in most conditions offering more adsorption sites for pollutants owing to their ultra high porosity high crystallinity homogeneity chemical and thermal stability and other attractive characteristics furthermore with the creation of hydrogen bonding and π π interactions some of these materials have demonstrated good selectivity for pahs this study section briefly discusses a few recent investigations on different porous non carbonaceous adsorbents the use of chitosan a chemical substance derived from the hard outer layer of shellfish for pollutants adsorption from wastewater has received much attention because of two advantages being economical and high content of hydroxyl functional groups on its surface 164 chitosan swells when used as adsorbents over an extended period as a result its use as a possible adsorbent material in wastewater clean up has been severely limited surface modification of chitosan with other appropriate functional materials on the other hand serves to improve the material s performance and long term use commercial chitosan is far less expensive than ac and it can be easily produced with very little energy significant pahs removal was obtained using chitosan as an adsorbent 165 solano et al studied nap adsorption using chitosan beads modified with thiourea titanium dioxide tio2 and magnetite fe3o4 nanoparticles the fe3o4 and tio2 improve the textural properties of chitosan i e increase the surface area and their constituent atoms induce donor d π acceptor interactions the maximum adsorption capacity recorded for cs t m ti beads was 133 690 mg g 166 similarly bibi et al showed the use of membrane surface area of 246 and 253 m2 g made from a blend of chitosan polyvinyl pyrrolidone and cnts for nap adsorption the maximum removal efficiency achieved was 97 in 150 mins 167 a review by zango et al showed that the hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interaction and π π interactions dominate the adsorption of pahs onto chitosan 92 in recent years molecular imprinting has grown in popularity as a powerful method for making highly selective polymeric substrates in the process monomers with chemical functionalities that complement the analyte are polymerized around an analyte before polymerization the connections that evolved between complementary functionalities present in the template molecule and the monomer are preserved in the final polymer after the analyte has been removed recognition sites in the polymer show a memory for the analyte in shape and chemical functionality complementarity mips offer multiple advantages that make them appealing for molecular recognition including the imprinted structure s stability and the wide range of compounds that can be imprinted several studies have described mips that collect organic micropollutants such as pahs from aqueous solutions as mentioned in table 5 costa et al found that the removal efficiency of b b f b k f and b a p obtained using si mcm 41 mesoporous molecular sieve was 90 40 90 84 92 98 respectively the greater contact area mechanical stability even mesopore size distribution and the ability to regenerate after an adsorption process efficiently make it efficient for pahs removal 4 similarly y hu et al investigated phe adsorption using mesoporous molecular sieve mcm 41 dry as adsorption media the removal efficiency obtained was 97 5 168 balati et al studied the removal of nap using mesoporous silicas mcm 48 and sba 15 the maximum nap removal observed was 79 3 169 niu et al used a laccase loading spider type reactor for pahs removal the removal efficiency was observed in a range of 95 3 97 6 170 fulekar showed significant degradation of ant and nap of up to 750 mg l using potential microorganisms and microbial consortium 171 recent studies of pahs adsorption using various non carbonaceous materials have been highlighted in table 5 4 parameters affecting the pahs adsorption pahs adsorption is a complex mechanism and a range of characteristics influences the pah adsorption process the magnitude of the effect varies with parameter therefore a few of the parameters are discussed in the following sections a range of characteristics influences the pahs adsorption process the magnitude of the effect varies with parameter 4 1 particle size of adsorbent the particle size of the adsorbent is an essential factor during pahs adsorption the removal efficiency of the adsorbent was observed to be correlated inversely with the size of adsorbent particles the smaller particle size provided a large contact area for mass transfer offering strong adsorption capacity towards pahs 89 villalobos et al estimated the influence of adsorbent particle size on the pahs adsorption using two mn iv birnessite oxide mineral of manganese adsorbents delta mno2 and acid birnessite the report concluded that the pah adsorption capacity was higher with delta mno2 as an adsorbent delta mno2 has a higher ssa due to its smaller particle size 174 similarly hundal et al studied the phe adsorption capacities of smectites and found that the large surface area of smectites makes it a suitable adsorbent for pahs removal 175 owabora et al effectively proved that the amount of nap removed decreased when the adsorbent particle size was increased this is because adsorption depends on mobile phase accessibility a finely divided adsorbent provided a large surface area to uptake adsorbate 176 in conclusion adsorption is a surface phenomenon whereas adsorption capacity is related to particle size therefore the smaller particle size of the adsorbent provides a larger surface area making more active sites available for adsorption and increasing the adsorption capacity 4 2 salinity the adsorption capacity of pahs was elevated with the increment in salinity of the aqueous solution wang et al showed that salinity altered the sediment s physicochemical properties and pahs adsorption trends by modifying its solubility pahs adsorption capacity is directly proportional to the media s salinity 89 as the salinity increases a reduction is observed in cavity volume to hold organic solutes which forces a more significant number of pahs molecules onto the adsorbent surface furthermore brunk et al observed that increasing the salinity from freshwater to seawater increases the phe overall adsorption coefficient by 55 177 similarly hegeman et al observed a minor increment in the adsorption capacity of phe and b a p with increased salinity from freshwater to seawater levels 178 as the salinity increases a reduction in electrostatic repulsion between sediments and pahs was observed promoting pahs adsorption on sediment surfaces 179 4 3 solubility a significant influence of the solubility of adsorbate can be observed on the adsorption capacity of adsorbents the pahs molecule s adsorption capacity and its solubility are inversely related 56 pahs adsorption capacity of sediments was observed to increase with the decrease in pahs solubility in aqueous solution 180 besides balati et al showed that with the increase in pahs number of aromatic rings nap acy and phe their solubility in water decreased 181 furthermore a study showed the relationship between solubility in aqueous solution and octanol water partition coefficients kow for pahs partitioning between organic matter and water in soils and found kow is inversely proportional to the solubility eq 1 calculates kow 1 k ow amount of organic chemical in octanol mg l amount of organic chemical in water mg l log kow expresses the octanol water coefficient directly proportional to pahs molecular weight for example log kow for ip is 6 50 and nap is 3 37 which indicates nap is sparingly soluble than ip the kow concentrate in this way confirmed the impact of substance structure on their dissolvability 182 also sun et al revealed an ascent in phe adsorption with a decline in dissolvability from 1 12 to 0 97 mg l 179 4 4 ph the ph value of a solution is a crucial parameter that affects the pahs adsorption the ph of a solution affects the adsorbent surface charge distribution and adsorbate ionization degree leading to variation in adsorption capacity 1 183 184 according to the findings of research by owabor et al the adsorption capacity of adsorbent reduces when the ph value is increased beyond a particular value i e ph value 6 a decrease in the electrostatic attraction between adsorbent and adsorbate was observed at increased ph value and as a result reduced adsorption is observed 176 gupta gupta studied the influence of ph ranging from 2 to 12 on the adsorption of pahs nap flu and phe on banana peel activated biochar bpac the results showed that with the ph increment the adsorption of all three pahs reduced 185 at low ph the adsorption of pahs observed was higher a positively charged adsorbent surface leads to elevated electrostatic attractions between pahs and the adsorbent surface at the lower ph scale of the solution the h ions link with the surface functional group on the biochar surface and occupy them therefore surface functional groups do not have enough surface for adsorbates pahs dehydrogenation of functional groups on a biochar surface can be accomplished by increasing ph making a chance for adsorbate coordination leading to higher pahs removal efficiency 65 186 wu et al revealed that the adsorption capacity of phe and nap using wac as adsorbent decreased with an increase in the solution s ph values at ph 3 the maximum adsorption capacities obtained were 145 mg g and 83 mg g of phe and nap respectively 187 the decrease in pahs removal might be attributed to oh ions and pahs competing for adsorption sites at high ph weakening electrostatic attraction among adsorbate adsorbents 176 187 albayati kalash estimated the highest removal efficiency of nap while maintaining ph 4 with the jump in ph from 5 to 10 efficiency was reduced from 90 6 to 75 and 74 67 to 62 66 for functionalized mcm 41 and non calcined mcm 41 respectively the reduction in removal efficiency might be due to interaction between nap electrons and positively charged functional groups of functionalized mcm 41 6 gupta reported maximum phe adsorption at low ph and minimum at high ph values at neutral ph the adsorption efficiency of phe was constant due to the presence of very minimal influence of h and oh ions on the adsorbent surface 91 additionally puszkarewicz jadwiga reported that in an alkaline ph 8 9 and 10 the pah removal using ac was weaker due to the electrostatic repulsion negative charges adsorbent and adsorbate surfaces 188 wijayaratne means studied the effect of ph on adsorption the study observed decreased adsorption when ambient ph 8 01 was increased to 9 0 or decreased to 5 0 the decline in adsorption was due to the changes in the polymeric structure of colloids during ph alteration 189 in contrast to other studies guo et al found no significant variation in adsorption of phe using mbc and bc for a ph range from 2 to 11 1 the reason might be phe did not get ionized in water solution due to its inert nature and did not show any charged area additionally h only attaches to bc at low ph by electrostatic forces since the bc had a ph of 4 32 and mbc with a ph of 3 71 shows positive charges no adsorption changed thus ph was not a significant deciding component for pah adsorption 1 similarly hu et al found no significant ph 3 0 11 0 impact on phe adsorption using hydrophobic molecular sieve mcm 41 168 using ac rad et al investigated the effect of ph on the adsorption rate of phe the initial value of phe were 5 10 20 30 and 40 ppm the adsorbent dosage of 0 3 g 100 ml and the ph range of 3 11 was used in a series of tests all of the experiments were carried out for a contact time of 17 h at ph 7 the highest adsorption capacity was achieved 186 these studies observed no significant negligible impact of ph variation on pahs adsorption additional experiments have to be carried out to understand the effect of ph on pahs adsorption thoroughly 4 5 temperature the effect of solution temperature on pahs adsorption relies upon biochar physicochemical characteristics the removal rate of pahs will increase with a rise in the temperature of the solution 190 the adsorption capacity decreases when a specific temperature as high temperature degrades the stability of adsorption sites on the biochar surface 191 high agglomeration rates experienced by an adsorbent at a raised temperature brought about a decrease in adsorption efficiency von t hoff is used to describe the effect of temperature on pahs adsorption eq 2 2 ln k eq h rt s r where t is the absolute temperature k δh is enthalpy change kj mol r is gas constant δs is entropy change kj mol k and k eq cm 3 g is the equilibrium partition coefficient at that particular temperature from eq 2 the negative slope δh r indicates the endothermic adsorption process and the positive slope states the exothermic process 192 the adsorption of pahs reduced by average values of 27 3 27 4 and 17 0 for nap pyr and phe respectively when temperature raised from 4 c to 27 c 191 whereas calculating enthalpies of adsorption δh using eq 2 gave negative value indicating exothermic process likewise a declining trend of nap adsorption was observed at temperature variation from 22 to 90 c 193 at high temperatures the adsorption reactions are exothermic henceforth the degree of adsorption increments with a decrease in temperature gupta gupta examined the temperature effects on the adsorption capacity of pahs nap flu and phe by conducting adsorption experiments at 20 30 40 and 50 c pahs removal efficiency increased with the temperature rise which showed that the pahs adsorption on bpab was endothermic 185 similarly balati et al showed high pahs adsorption capacity from wastewater using nh2 sba 15 with increment in temperature the positive enthalpy values showed that the pahs adsorption on nh2 sba 15 was endothermic 181 using eq 2 in contrast with the previous studies xu et al reported that pahs total removal efficiency decreases from 51 0 to 29 4 with the rise in temperature from 90 to 150 c the decrease in removal efficiency was because the van der waals forces between the molecules fell with the temperature rise destroying the pahs adsorption dynamic equilibrium and increasing pahs molecules removal from the ac s adsorption site 194 y sun et al obtained a similar observation that pahs adsorption nap ant and pyr on graphene inhibited by temperature rise 143 similarly hiller et al studied the effect of temperature on pahs distribution results indicated that with the temperature increment from 4 to 27 c the extent of pahs adsorption decreased by 27 3 17 0 and 27 4 for nap phe and pyr respectively 191 various studies have shown that pahs adsorption on adsorbents is spontaneous and an exothermic process the increasing temperature would decrease adsorption 143 192 194 4 6 adsorbate concentrations with an increase in pahs concentration pahs adsorption increases up to an optimum value and decreases afterwards as the pah concentration increased most of the active sites were filled therefore it was difficult for adsorbate to utilize the remaining active sites 57 gupta experimented with phe adsorption using ac produced from orange rind for phe adsorption with 10 50 mg l concentrations the results showed increased adsorption capacity of adsorbent with increased pahs concentrations 91 besides gupta gupta studied the adsorption of pahs using ac produced from banana peel for different pahs concentrations 5 10 mg l a comparable outcome was distributed by gong et al the study examined utilizing different oil solutions resulting in varying pahs concentrations a high initial concentration of pahs showed positive effects the accessibility of more pahs to interact with ac s active sites might be the reason for the positive impact 96 furthermore owabora et al showed that nap removal efficiency improves with the rise in its concentration the higher pahs dose provided a large surface area leading to more accessibility of the adsorbent for the nap solution 176 xu et al found that the pahs removal efficiency using ac increased from 29 3 41 1 with the increased pahs concentration in the flue gas from 1 5 to 3 5 μg m3 the increase in removal efficiency can be attributed to the rise in the significant collision of ac and pahs molecules which increases the pah molecule s mass transfer at the ac surface 194 similarly ping et al showed that phe adsorption capacity increased with the rise in initial pahs concentration 195 furthermore hall et al reported that ant adsorption capacity onto silica gel increased 0 178 1 296 mg g for the rise in initial concentration 0 376 1 795 mg l 196 costa et al showed that the amount of pahs adsorbed using si mcm 41 increased with the increase in initial pahs concentrations 4 these results were explained as the adsorption occurs majorly at si mcm 41 outermost surface and relocation towards destinations more profound inside the mesoporous material at higher initial pahs concentrations 197 4 6 1 adsorption isotherms investigation of adsorption equilibrium is a significant advance in examining the process of adsorption it is conceivable to recognize the correlation between the adsorbed analyte and the amount present in the solution after attaining the equilibrium 198 an adsorption isotherm curve explains substance movement from an aqueous environment to a solid phase maintaining stable conditions many studies have used linear and non linear models such as langmuir freundlich redlich peterson temkin and linear to understand the interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate isotherm models langmuir freundlich redlich peterson temkin and linear isotherm models are used to decide the pahs adsorption limit of the adsorbents and comprehend the complex mechanisms involved in the adsorption process the experimental data in pahs adsorption fit well with the langmuir isotherm for low values of equilibrium adsorbent concentrations indicating that the adsorption process occurs as a monolayer phenomenon 1 4 6 198 however at high concentrations adsorption was found to be heterogeneous 90 and multilayer mechanism and best characterized by the freundlich temkin and redlich peterson model an unrealistic asymptotic behavior was found for an intermediate adsorbate concentration and the dubinin radushkevich isotherm better suited the experimental data as a result it does not forecast henry s laws under low pressure 198 few studies on pahs adsorption on various adsorbents with different isotherms have been mentioned in table 6 4 7 adsorbent dose adsorption is a surface phenomenon and directly correlates to the available area for contact the removal percentage of pahs increases with an increase in the adsorbent dose fig 3 with a high adsorbent dose the surface area of the adsorbent increases and extensive adsorbent site availability results in high pahs adsorption albayati kalash studied the removal efficiency of nap the efficiency increases from 49 2 68 6 and 74 100 when the adsorbent dose increases from 0 01 0 1 g for non calcined and functionalized mcm 41 respectively the incremented contact area and the accessibility of more adsorption active sites resulted in higher removal capacity as the adsorbent concentration increased 6 puszkarewicz reported a linear relationship between adsorbent dosage and adsorption efficiency the nap adsorption efficiency of 95 and 94 were obtained for a dose of 3 0 g dm3 of dto i and ag 5 carbons respectively 188 more readily sites were accessible on the adsorbent surface increasing its dose 35 57 guo et al reported that increasing the bc dose increases the rate of pahs removal maximum phe reduction 85 was achieved with an adsorbent dosage of 2 0 mg and remains stable at higher doses excessive adsorbent dosage caused aggregation problems as a result the binding sites and adsorbent surface area were reduced while the diffusional path length was increased 1 199 these studies observed that adsorbent dose influences pahs adsorption significantly however the effect lessens as the dosage is raised the possibility of higher aggregation as the adsorbent dosage increases limiting the number of active sites accessible for adsorption results in a decrease in pahs adsorption 97 99 fig 4 shows the trend of pahs removal as the adsorbent dose increases the x axis represents normalized dosage the dosage increase in each experiment has been represented as a multiple of the initial dosage following are the initial dosages for the various experiments depicted in the diagram 185 1 093 mg 200 10 mg and 201 49 mg the graph depicts the trend caused by the dosage increase the removal rate initially increases and then reaches a maximum limit 4 8 contact time higher pahs adsorption has been reported with an increase in contact time it can be attributed to the higher amount of adsorbent migrating when subjected to longer adsorption time 202 zeledón toruño et al performed an experiment using pyr b k fl b a p b ghi p and flu with pahs initial concentration as 100 mg l and observed 70 pahs removal efficiency with 2 h of contact time the removal efficiency gradually improved with an increment in contact time and the equilibrium was obtained within 24 h with the highest uptake efficiency of 82 for pyr b k fl b a p and b ghi p and 78 4 for flu 203 hu et al reported that the adsorption rate rapidly increased during the initial 20 min and reached equilibrium slowly after 1 h on phe adsorption using mesoporous molecular sieve mcm 41 168 no significant adsorption change was observed until 2 h it might be due to the repulsive forces between adsorbate molecules and adsorbents at equilibrium make it challenging to fill the remaining positions albayati kalash investigated the removal efficiency of nap using non calcined mcm 41 nap adsorption was increased rapidly for the initial 10 min and gradually attained equilibrium after 20 min albayati kalash also reported that the nap adsorption increased rapidly for the first 10 min and gradually up to 50 min while using functionalized mcm 41 as an adsorbent 6 rinawati et al inferred that phe and fl adsorption increases with time and attain equilibrium after 60 min and 30 min respectively adsorption capacity increase with time might be due to enhanced pahs diffusion onto the adsorbent surface 57 4 9 adsorption kinetics it is necessary to optimize the time required for adsorption equilibrium to design effective adsorption systems the adsorption rate of pahs on adsorbent surfaces is an important parameter to determine the shortest time needed to achieve adsorption equilibrium several kinetic models including pseudo first order kinetics pseudo second order kinetics intra particle diffusion and elovich kinetic models have been reported in the literature to determine the behavior of pah molecules on the porous adsorbent surfaces in most studies it was reported that the pseudo first order equation does not perform accurately for the total span of contact time a pseudo first order is applicable mainly for the first 20 30 min of the adsorption process the pseudo second order equation is the most suitable for chemisorption processes as it provides a higher degree of correlation 181 204 pseudo second order kinetics models perform best with several adsorbents such as ac 202 walnut shell based ac 187 zeolite 205 and modified periodic mesoporous organo silica 198 reported studies on pahs adsorption on various adsorbents with different kinetics models and the effect of process parameters on pahs adsorption have been summarized in table 7 and table 8 respectively 5 conclusions and future recommendations pahs are toxic and it is essential to remove them from wastewater and contaminated soil adsorption is the most widely used pahs removal technique due to its high removal efficiency low cost and recyclable material usage also adsorption does not produce any secondary pollutants and effectively treats contaminants of all concentrations the study foumd that the efficiency of the adsorption process is determined not only by the characteristics of the adsorption media and adsorbate but also by operating parameters such as ph solubility temperature and contact time in addition adsorption capacity is more significant when adsorbents are produced at higher temperatures furthermore studies have shown that 100 removal efficiency can be achieved by using suitable adsorbent media and operating variables a increasing the salinity or decreasing the solubility of the aqueous solution increases the adsorption efficiency of the adsorbent b the effect of ph and temperature on adsorption is not understood completely and further investigations are required c the adsorption capacity increases with an increase in contact time until equilibrium after which contact does not affect adsorption capacity d an increase in concentrations of either the adsorbate or the adsorbent positively impacts adsorption efficiency material performance and cost efficiency are the most important parameters for developing carbon and non carbon based materials for wastewater treatment and industrial applications therefore further investigation is needed into physicochemical properties suitability and regeneration capability to improve an adsorbent s structural stability and compliance for pahs polluted water greener methods for producing carbonaceous and non carbonaceous materials with high selectivity capacity and affinity for wastewater treatment are urgently required therefore a purpose directed risk based sustainable remediation method is pivotal for appropriately managing severely pahs polluted water credit authorship contribution statement

13053,the efficient elimination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from resources such as water and soil is a concern as it severely impacts the environment and human health adsorption is one of the efficient and economical techniques for removing pahs activated carbon biochar carbon nanotubes graphene and many non carbonaceous materials are the common absorbents used for pahs removal a significant amount of pahs can be scavenged approximately 100 from wastewater using appropriate adsorbents researchers have observed that adsorbent s physicochemical properties have a substantial role in adsorption mechanism and performance adsorbent particle size pahs solubility and salinity of the solution temperature and ph are all critical factors in pahs adsorption capacity in this context the

treatment plants 1 introduction organic compounds are abundant in nature polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are one of the sub divisions of the organic compounds made of carbon and hydrogen and consist of more than one aromatic ring 1 3 many studies have considered pahs carcinogenic teratogenic mutagenic toxic and resistive to the natural biodegradation processes making them detrimental to the environment and aquatic systems 2 4 7 pahs are also classified based on the number of aromatic rings in their molecular structure and molecular weight with two or three aromatic rings pahs are referred to as low molecular weight lmw pahs e g nap ace fl phe and has a molecular weight ranging 128 17 178 23 g mol pahs with four or more aromatic rings as heavy molecular weight hmv pahs e g pyr chr b a p d a h a and has a molecular weight from 222 25 278 4 g mol 8 pahs with high molecular weight are more toxic and stable than light pahs 5 9 pahs sources range from natural to anthropogenic various literature reported wood and coal burning 10 11 petrol and diesel combustion 12 13 industrial discharge 14 16 vehicular emissions volcanic and hydrothermal processes 17 18 forest fires 19 20 as polluting pah sources and atmospheric deposition 21 24 as non point polluting sources shen et al reported that globally 504 gigagram gg of the most harmful sixteen pahs were released into the atmosphere in 2007 25 the sources were recognised as biomass burning residential commercial 60 5 biomass burning in open field agricultural residue burning wildlife and deforestation 13 6 and on road motor vehicles petroleum consumption 12 8 25 fig 1 moreover atmospheric deposition influences more than 80 of the pahs present in the environment 26 the global pahs emissions peaked at 592 gg in 1995 then progressively dropped to 499 gg in 2008 based on the six ipcc sres scenarios pahs emissions in developed and developing nations would drop by 46 71 and 48 64 respectively from 2009 to 2030 25 wang et al on the other hand looked at yearly pahs emissions over mainland china yearly emissions decreased from 112 92 gg to 100 09 gg during 2013 2017 27 tsiodra et al studied the seasonal concentrations of pahs in the greater athens area regions in southern europe from 2016 to 2018 the mean pahs concentrations in winter 2016 2017 spring 2017 summer 2017 autumn 2017 and winter 2017 2018 were 7 0 10 1 2 5 4 1 0 9 0 9 2 2 3 2 and 22 3 26 8 ng m3 respectively 28 studies have also reported alarmingly high pah concentrations in water bodies the south eastern sea of japan has pah levels of 0 3 ng l 22 while the surface waters of wuhai and lingwu have pah levels in the range 27 5 to 234 ng l and 135 to 265 ng l respectively 29 also edokpayi et al reported pah levels of 16 590 000 ng l in a south african province 30 and h yuan et al 753 ng l in china s yellow river delta 31 major contributors of the pah to the yellow river s wuhai waters are coal combustion 35 and vehicle emissions 34 29 most pahs sources are found near the urban areas and cause a higher concentration than the rural settlement pahs in vapor and solid phases in the atmosphere adsorb on the particulate matter surface in the presence of sunlight adsorbed pahs undergo photo oxidation which results in their chemical breakdown 14 studies have observed that pahs toxicity increases in ultraviolet light whereas metabolism and photo oxidation suppress the toxicity of pahs pahs have mild to acute toxic effects on the birds and aquatic life albers reported a higher concentration of pahs in fish and shellfish than in surroundings due to bioaccumulation although terrestrial invertebrates also showed bioaccumulation of pahs no poisonous impact has been documented 32 the metabolism of pahs may inhibit bioaccumulation 33 pah generated phytotoxic effects are rare certain plants synthesize the pahs that act as growth hormones and the remaining plants contain some substances that can protect them against the adverse impacts of pahs 34 inhalation ingestion and dermal contact of pahs adversely affect reproduction development and immunity and cause tumors 34 the united states environmental protection agency usepa has listed various pahs from industrial effluents and categorized sixteen pahs out of hundreds in the priority list under the impact on the habitat 35 37 the structure molecular weight maximum allowed concentration and health impacts of these sixteen highly toxic pahs have been shown in table 1 to develop cost effective and environmentally sustainable pahs remediation highly efficient and environmentally sustainable biomass based products are being used biomass derived low cost carbon compounds can be considered adequate substitutes for pah removal due to their specific characteristics such as the ability to hold water for a long time high porosity and large surface area among the other methods the adsorption method has been identified as a potential technique for treating pahs cost effectively and sustainably 21 56 57 therefore various studies are conducted to find the most efficient and economically feasible adsorbent and parameters affecting the pahs removal process 58 63 however limited research has been available about the adsorption media used to remove pahs from aqueous solutions and the factors that influence their efficiency this paper encapsulates various studies on removing pahs and outlines the merits and demerits of different pahs removal processes the primary objective of this review is to describe recent literature on pahs removal via adsorption a comprehensive discussion on the specific adsorption mechanism of various adsorbents and the operating parameters that determine the adsorption process and efficiency is provided in the review paper 2 pahs removal techniques conventional processes for pahs removal from wastewater include physical chemical adsorption aerobic anaerobic biodegradation processes biological processes and their combinations 7 64 66 these processes have various limitations such as complex processes high investment and maintenance costs many processes release by products that are mutagenic and carcinogenic 67 70 as a result the search for more alternative techniques appears to be never ending the advantages and disadvantages of various pahs removal techniques have been summarized in table 2 only a few have been demonstrated commercially among all the widely available wastewater treatment technologies applicable for pahs removal since 1992 condorchem envitech has been using various techniques such as reverse osmosis nanofiltration bioaugmentation coagulation flocculation direct filtration and adsorption to treat drinking and industrial wastewater at commercial scales 84 due to high operating costs advanced oxidation catalytic degradation and bioremediation have not yet been commercialized for field industrial scale water treatment despite being proven effective and thriving in the laboratory non commercialization is due to the complexity of incorporating these techniques into current water treatment systems or scaling them up to handle large quantities of water 76 adsorption is the most widely used technique for wastewater treatment using a wide range of products from gac 85 silver impregnated coconut ac ag gac 66 86 to pac from wood and coal 2 1 pahs removal using adsorption adsorption is a very efficient technique for extracting organic contaminants including pahs from wastewater 87 the adsorption process offers numerous advantages such as eco friendly energy efficient high temperature applicability and economical adsorbents produced from agricultural residue industrial solid waste and mineral deposits 56 88 89 the techno economic feasibility of the adsorption process is influenced by the type of adsorbent and adsorbate and process parameters most pahs removal technologies rely on the hydrophobicity of material which is responsible for interfacial adsorption to absorb pahs molecules in this context eeshwarasinghe et al employed gac to scavenge pahs molecules from wastewater which required a few hours to remove pahs by gac 90 in recent years many studies have shown the development of specialized pahs removal techniques with removal occurring by intercalation π π bonding and inclusion complexation adsorption using adsorbents such as bc and ac has been reported as an effective approach for removing pahs from an aqueous solution in the literature 21 89 91 therefore adsorption gives a better option for converting waste into value added products to sustain the environment 2 2 pahs adsorption at pilot and industrial scale municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been the primary pah repositories heavy rains often wash these pollutants from soil or have been directly released from petroleum treatment plants petrochemicals coal mining and manufacturing industries several investigations have found that these contaminants have been present in significantly higher concentrations than the permitted level as a result wwt systems have been developed for industrial and urban stations 92 ac is most commonly used for the after treatment of non significant toxins such as pahs in wwtps because of its homogeneous surface microspores and increased contact surface area 93 researchers used the accessibility of several economic and extremely permeable adsorbent media to examine adsorbent removals of pahs in pilot and industrial plants kalmykova et al investigated sand gacs and peat moss fillers for pilot plant pah adsorption and reported that 50 63 pahs removal was achieved from peat and gac 94 gonzalez et al studied the removal of pahs by membrane bioreactor mbr at the pilot scale and concluded that the pahs removal efficiency depends on various properties of pahs lmw pahs phe were removed more easily as compared to hmw fl 95 likewise gong et al studied lab scale pahs adsorption using activated carbon from vegetable oil to ascertain pahs contaminated oil regeneration they inferred that ac dosage and pahs initial concentration affected the adsorption significantly 96 furthermore ilyas et al utilized ac from waste polyethylene terephthalate wpet ac and waste polystyrene wps ac to remove toxic pahs from water at pilot scale according to the results when compared to wps ac wpet ac had a greater ability to absorb the 16 pahs listed in table 1 the adsorption percentage of the 16 pahs varied from 53 80 92 44 in the case of wpet ac 97 3 adsorption media for pahs removal this section includes an extensive review of recent studies on pahs adsorption using various porous carbonaceous materials such as biochar 1 98 ac 57 99 cnts 80 81 and porous non carbonaceous adsorbents databases including scopus sciencedirect scifinder and web of science were used to search the literature the literature for this study was selected based on relevancy substance publication year and keywords some of the keywords used to discover literature included activated carbon biochar cnts graphene pahs adsorption pahs removal methods biochar process parameters and adsorption process parameters research and review papers conference proceedings thesis books and book chapters relevant to each subsidiary ac bc for pahs adsorption variables affecting adsorption process adsorption isotherms were chosen after carefully examining the aim and contents for the present study a total of 206 shortlisted papers were extensively reviewed to extract essential information the literature included in the present study was published between 2019 and 21 40 42 2015 18 38 829 and 2006 10 20 744 fig 2 depicts the number of papers using a particular adsorbent for the pah removal over the last 10 years the ac has been the most widely used among the adsorbents nearly 50 of the studies followed by bc and other adsorbents the pahs removal mechanism using these adsorbents has been discussed in later sections 3 1 biochar organic materials such as agricultural and forest residues and municipal solid wastes pyrolyzed in the temperature range of 300 700 c under an oxygen limited environment produce biochar 102 105 the hydrophobicity surface chemistry surface area porous structure and pore size of biochar significantly influence its adsorption capacity 1 106 108 pahs adsorption using biochar is based on pore filling hydrophobic impact electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonding and precipitation mechanism the physicochemical properties of biochar such as dose pyrolysis temperature and medium ph are the influential factors for pahs adsorption 109 113 the pahs molecules diffuse into the pores of the biochar s uncarbonized section where they can interact directly with pahs and cause adsorption 114 pahs polarity and the nature and type of biochar influence their adsorption an essential mechanism for pahs adsorption onto biochar s surface is electrostatic interaction biochar s ability to attract or repel any organic contaminant including pahs is influenced by the solution s ionic strength and the ph 109 115 the adsorption of aromatic compounds like pahs on biochar is mainly due to electron donor and acceptor interaction 117 biochar s electron density to generate deficient or enriched π electron is however dependent on the pyrolysis temperature if the temperature is 500 c the biochar s aromaticity acts as an electron acceptor whereas biochar acts as a donor if the temperature is 500 c 116 118 guo et al prepared magnetically modified biochar mbc from rice husk to remove phe from aqueous solutions and reported 97 6 mg g phe adsorption capacity higher than other biochar obtained from different feedstocks 1 jesus et al investigated the removal efficiency of pahs using coconut waste derived biochar the removal efficiency reported was 81 73 78 51 and 81 97 for b a a b k f and b a p respectively 119 similarly godlewska et al observed high adsorption capacity for phe and pyr using biochar produced from sewage sludge 120 also liu et al achieved the adsorption capacity of nap as 384 mg l using poplar catkins biochar 121 li et al studied the removal efficiency of pahs using biochar made from wheat straw at different temperatures 400 600 and 800 c the removal efficiency increased from 71 to 98 6 with the rise in pyrolysis temperature reflecting a linear trend 61 the increase in removal efficiency might increase the biochar s hydrophobic nature and aromaticity resulting in π π enhancement and increased hydrophobic interactions between the biochar surface and the pahs in agreement with this study chen et al used pine needles derived biochar at different temperatures 250 700 c for removing nap and achieved 136 8 mg g maximum adsorption at 700 c 122 researchers have observed a non linear relationship between biochar adsorption capacity and its production temperature which could be due to the breaking of ester groups and the aliphatic alkyl with an increase in temperature 62 63 moreover a rise in pyrolysis temperature improved the biochar surface area leading to increased active sites for adsorption ding et al revealed that the total surface area of the adsorbent was linearly related to pyrolysis temperature resulting in higher adsorption capacity as temperature rises 123 3 2 activated carbon due to its substantial internal ssa and elaborated porous structure ac is widely used for removing organic contaminants including pahs from aqueous solutions ac could adsorb low concentration pollutants efficiently making it a suitable adsorbent for pahs adsorption 124 126 ac could be produced from carbonaceous materials such as bituminous coal 127 petroleum coke 128 sewage sludge 129 plant based material 130 the residues undergo the process of carbonization followed by activation functional group interactions vander waals force interactions π π interactions and hydrogen bonding at the adsorbent surface are the primary cause for the adsorption 132 also the chemical characteristics of ac could be altered easily through chemical treatment 133 ge et al modified the ac produced from coal for pyrene adsorption from aqueous solution using ammonia treatment a cac microwave radiation m cac and microwave radiation combined with ammonia ma cac they inferred that the moderation improved the surface area of the adsorbents as well as pore volume they observed that the bet surface area of the adsorbents increased from 764 96 cac 1293 78 m2 g ma cac 134 danish and ahmad conducted a review on ac production as an adsorbent material from wood biomass they reported that surface area and ac s pore size were the major contributing factors to pahs adsorption 135 surface functional groups containing oxygen carboxyl phenols carbonyl lactones quinones and sulfhydryl and amino groups could be the main drivers for pollutant interaction with ac their presence has a significant impact on pahs removal efficiency alves et al investigated the effectiveness of sugarcane straw ac scac as an adsorbent for pahs removal from wastewater the study concluded that scac had superior adsorption capability to commercial carbon samples 136 according to the kinetics study carbon generated from residual biomass scac performs similarly to commercial aac emphasizing that the textural features are significant in pahs adsorption eeshwarasinghe et al showed langmuir adsorption capabilities of acy 0 31 2 63 mg g and phe 0 74 7 36 mg g using gac as adsorbent 90 rinawati et al research suggested rhac for eliminating pahs phe and fl from the aquatic environment the adsorption capacities of phe and fl were reported to be 98 99 and 50 respectively 57 as shown in table 3 similar work was conducted by rasheed et al pahs removal efficiency reported was 99 using pac as adsorbent 60 as demonstrated in table 4 ac properties vary with their activation process parameters such as activating agent process temperature and flow rate of an oxidizing agent ac with different adsorption capacities could be produced from the same feedstock 23 137 yuan et al showed that pahs adsorption capacity increases by changing the koh activating agent and coke ratio during the activation of carbon from petroleum coke 23 likewise h kong et al illustrated that the pah adsorption capacity of ac produced from soybean stalk increases with increased temperature as mentioned in table 4 higher adsorption capacity can be attributed to a hike in ssa with the rise in temperature 137 when the carbonization temperature was raised from 300 to 600 c during the process of nap adsorption the minimum removal efficiency of the flamboyant pod s ac f ac and the milk bush kernel shell ac mb ac rose from 1 28 to 1 49 mg g and 1 20 to 1 41 mg g respectively and the maximum removal efficiency rose from 3 99 to 4 39 mg g and 3 27 to 3 94 mg g 138 as mentioned in table 5 a similar pattern was observed when 139 studied ant adsorption using f ac and mb ac maximum removal efficiency increased from 58 65 65 39 and 54 48 58 75 for flamboyant pod back and milk bush kernel shells respectively as the carbonization temperature increased from 300 to 600 c for the gaseous phase compared to standard gases vaporous pahs with greater molecular weights and lower volatility provide entirely different adsorption forms e g a better affinity to pores and a significant adsorption potential at very low concentrations more significant molecular sizes of pahs do not favor adsorbent pore s mass transfer and diffusion within adsorbing pores significantly decreasing adsorption speeds moreover the sturdy interactions between pahs and adsorbents which in practical applications contribute to increased energy consumption in temperature swing adsorption processes need a much higher thermal desorption temperature for adsorption ac showed improved removal efficiency and reduced equilibrium time for pahs adsorption compared to bc the most probable cause could be the higher porosity of ac bc has a lower cost of production and consumes less activation energy than ac 61 pahs adsorption happens due to the π π electron and hydrogen bonding sites of the adsorbent surface porous properties can be changed to increase removal capacities by modifying the surface of ac and bc besides this modifications also stabilize the adsorbents 3 3 carbon nanotubes cnts other than bc and ac cnts are among the most employed adsorbents for pahs removal from wastewater the chemical and thermal stability of cnts is very high also it has a surface area comparable to bc and ac which makes it suitable for pahs adsorption compared to other carbonaceous materials it has been acknowledged for superior chemical and physical properties 147 148 modified surface properties permit it to associate with organic contaminants through the various non covalent and covalent bond formations cnts are formed when 2 dimensional 2d carbon atoms sheets in hexagonal shape are rolled into a tube generating a tube type structure the physicochemical characteristics of cnts are determined by the different combinations with which graphene sheets are rolled the atomic configurations of graphene sheets influences the length and diameter of cnts 149 cnts have been widely researched for their application to remove organic pollutants such as pahs from wastewater 100 150 151 cnts and ac have comparable morphologies in terms of structure also both can be chemically changed 152 high water permeability due to high ssa and large ratio of accessible micropores 153 make cnts a suitable adsorbent for pahs adsorption the ssa and chemical functional groups on the surface have an impact on the adsorption process efficiency 101 these parameters must be modified to maximize the sites for adsorption on cnts 154 zhang et al prepared a magnetic composite of mwcnt swcnt with iron oxide for the adsorption of phe from water a higher adsorption capacity was found in the magnetic composite as compared to swcnt and mwcnt individually further cnts magnetization increased removal efficiency and ease in regeneration and adsorbents re useability 59 the hydrophobic electrostatic π π stacking vander waals forces of interaction and hydrogen bonding are the primary mechanism for pahs adsorption over cnts 155 3 4 graphene graphene is a 2d carbon sheet with hexagonally arranged carbon atoms with each atom closely packed to other atoms as cnts are a rolled version of the graphene sheet the interaction of graphene with pahs is the same as that in the case of cnts such as hydrogen bonding π π and electrostatic interactions 156 the π π bond forms between the benzene ring present on the surface of graphene nanosheets gns and the carbon double bond of pahs molecule 157 the benefit of gns over other carbon based materials is the strong connection between oc molecules and the open up layer graphene surface via π π interaction 158 159 the large ssa of graphene contributes to its high adsorption capacity by creating many binding sites 160 wang et al investigated the graphene gns and graphene oxide go nanosheet s ability to adsorb nap phe and pyr the conclusion was that graphene had a high affinity towards pahs 161 similarly 95 and 60 nap removal efficiencies were obtained using rgo and go respectively 143 besides bai et al used tio2 graphene composites for pahs adsorption and achieved re of 80 58 furthermore jun wang chen studied the adsorption of nap using arg go and crg the maximum adsorption achieved with go crg arg was 21 52 145 mg g respectively 142 table 4 shows that the adsorption capacity of phe and pyr was obtained at 5 mg g and 20 mg g respectively using graphene wool as an adsorbent 144 compared to go and rgo graphene was shown to have greater adsorption capability in most instances go has more functional groups containing oxygen and electron density lower than rgo the hydrophobic effects of organic pollutants were shown to cause their enhanced absorption on graphene molecules which occurs due to π π interactions 162 the dense carbonyl groups present at the surface of the carbon layers were responsible for the significant adsorption of organic contaminants including pahs onto the material s surface via electrostatic anion π interactions and hydrogen bonding in the case of go 92 163 3 5 other adsorbents for pahs adsorption various studies have been directed at using non carbonaceous materials such as chitosan mesoporous silica molecularly imprinted polymers metal organic frameworks and similar composite materials as adsorbents for the removal of pahs these materials out perform carbon based materials like ac in most conditions offering more adsorption sites for pollutants owing to their ultra high porosity high crystallinity homogeneity chemical and thermal stability and other attractive characteristics furthermore with the creation of hydrogen bonding and π π interactions some of these materials have demonstrated good selectivity for pahs this study section briefly discusses a few recent investigations on different porous non carbonaceous adsorbents the use of chitosan a chemical substance derived from the hard outer layer of shellfish for pollutants adsorption from wastewater has received much attention because of two advantages being economical and high content of hydroxyl functional groups on its surface 164 chitosan swells when used as adsorbents over an extended period as a result its use as a possible adsorbent material in wastewater clean up has been severely limited surface modification of chitosan with other appropriate functional materials on the other hand serves to improve the material s performance and long term use commercial chitosan is far less expensive than ac and it can be easily produced with very little energy significant pahs removal was obtained using chitosan as an adsorbent 165 solano et al studied nap adsorption using chitosan beads modified with thiourea titanium dioxide tio2 and magnetite fe3o4 nanoparticles the fe3o4 and tio2 improve the textural properties of chitosan i e increase the surface area and their constituent atoms induce donor d π acceptor interactions the maximum adsorption capacity recorded for cs t m ti beads was 133 690 mg g 166 similarly bibi et al showed the use of membrane surface area of 246 and 253 m2 g made from a blend of chitosan polyvinyl pyrrolidone and cnts for nap adsorption the maximum removal efficiency achieved was 97 in 150 mins 167 a review by zango et al showed that the hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interaction and π π interactions dominate the adsorption of pahs onto chitosan 92 in recent years molecular imprinting has grown in popularity as a powerful method for making highly selective polymeric substrates in the process monomers with chemical functionalities that complement the analyte are polymerized around an analyte before polymerization the connections that evolved between complementary functionalities present in the template molecule and the monomer are preserved in the final polymer after the analyte has been removed recognition sites in the polymer show a memory for the analyte in shape and chemical functionality complementarity mips offer multiple advantages that make them appealing for molecular recognition including the imprinted structure s stability and the wide range of compounds that can be imprinted several studies have described mips that collect organic micropollutants such as pahs from aqueous solutions as mentioned in table 5 costa et al found that the removal efficiency of b b f b k f and b a p obtained using si mcm 41 mesoporous molecular sieve was 90 40 90 84 92 98 respectively the greater contact area mechanical stability even mesopore size distribution and the ability to regenerate after an adsorption process efficiently make it efficient for pahs removal 4 similarly y hu et al investigated phe adsorption using mesoporous molecular sieve mcm 41 dry as adsorption media the removal efficiency obtained was 97 5 168 balati et al studied the removal of nap using mesoporous silicas mcm 48 and sba 15 the maximum nap removal observed was 79 3 169 niu et al used a laccase loading spider type reactor for pahs removal the removal efficiency was observed in a range of 95 3 97 6 170 fulekar showed significant degradation of ant and nap of up to 750 mg l using potential microorganisms and microbial consortium 171 recent studies of pahs adsorption using various non carbonaceous materials have been highlighted in table 5 4 parameters affecting the pahs adsorption pahs adsorption is a complex mechanism and a range of characteristics influences the pah adsorption process the magnitude of the effect varies with parameter therefore a few of the parameters are discussed in the following sections a range of characteristics influences the pahs adsorption process the magnitude of the effect varies with parameter 4 1 particle size of adsorbent the particle size of the adsorbent is an essential factor during pahs adsorption the removal efficiency of the adsorbent was observed to be correlated inversely with the size of adsorbent particles the smaller particle size provided a large contact area for mass transfer offering strong adsorption capacity towards pahs 89 villalobos et al estimated the influence of adsorbent particle size on the pahs adsorption using two mn iv birnessite oxide mineral of manganese adsorbents delta mno2 and acid birnessite the report concluded that the pah adsorption capacity was higher with delta mno2 as an adsorbent delta mno2 has a higher ssa due to its smaller particle size 174 similarly hundal et al studied the phe adsorption capacities of smectites and found that the large surface area of smectites makes it a suitable adsorbent for pahs removal 175 owabora et al effectively proved that the amount of nap removed decreased when the adsorbent particle size was increased this is because adsorption depends on mobile phase accessibility a finely divided adsorbent provided a large surface area to uptake adsorbate 176 in conclusion adsorption is a surface phenomenon whereas adsorption capacity is related to particle size therefore the smaller particle size of the adsorbent provides a larger surface area making more active sites available for adsorption and increasing the adsorption capacity 4 2 salinity the adsorption capacity of pahs was elevated with the increment in salinity of the aqueous solution wang et al showed that salinity altered the sediment s physicochemical properties and pahs adsorption trends by modifying its solubility pahs adsorption capacity is directly proportional to the media s salinity 89 as the salinity increases a reduction is observed in cavity volume to hold organic solutes which forces a more significant number of pahs molecules onto the adsorbent surface furthermore brunk et al observed that increasing the salinity from freshwater to seawater increases the phe overall adsorption coefficient by 55 177 similarly hegeman et al observed a minor increment in the adsorption capacity of phe and b a p with increased salinity from freshwater to seawater levels 178 as the salinity increases a reduction in electrostatic repulsion between sediments and pahs was observed promoting pahs adsorption on sediment surfaces 179 4 3 solubility a significant influence of the solubility of adsorbate can be observed on the adsorption capacity of adsorbents the pahs molecule s adsorption capacity and its solubility are inversely related 56 pahs adsorption capacity of sediments was observed to increase with the decrease in pahs solubility in aqueous solution 180 besides balati et al showed that with the increase in pahs number of aromatic rings nap acy and phe their solubility in water decreased 181 furthermore a study showed the relationship between solubility in aqueous solution and octanol water partition coefficients kow for pahs partitioning between organic matter and water in soils and found kow is inversely proportional to the solubility eq 1 calculates kow 1 k ow amount of organic chemical in octanol mg l amount of organic chemical in water mg l log kow expresses the octanol water coefficient directly proportional to pahs molecular weight for example log kow for ip is 6 50 and nap is 3 37 which indicates nap is sparingly soluble than ip the kow concentrate in this way confirmed the impact of substance structure on their dissolvability 182 also sun et al revealed an ascent in phe adsorption with a decline in dissolvability from 1 12 to 0 97 mg l 179 4 4 ph the ph value of a solution is a crucial parameter that affects the pahs adsorption the ph of a solution affects the adsorbent surface charge distribution and adsorbate ionization degree leading to variation in adsorption capacity 1 183 184 according to the findings of research by owabor et al the adsorption capacity of adsorbent reduces when the ph value is increased beyond a particular value i e ph value 6 a decrease in the electrostatic attraction between adsorbent and adsorbate was observed at increased ph value and as a result reduced adsorption is observed 176 gupta gupta studied the influence of ph ranging from 2 to 12 on the adsorption of pahs nap flu and phe on banana peel activated biochar bpac the results showed that with the ph increment the adsorption of all three pahs reduced 185 at low ph the adsorption of pahs observed was higher a positively charged adsorbent surface leads to elevated electrostatic attractions between pahs and the adsorbent surface at the lower ph scale of the solution the h ions link with the surface functional group on the biochar surface and occupy them therefore surface functional groups do not have enough surface for adsorbates pahs dehydrogenation of functional groups on a biochar surface can be accomplished by increasing ph making a chance for adsorbate coordination leading to higher pahs removal efficiency 65 186 wu et al revealed that the adsorption capacity of phe and nap using wac as adsorbent decreased with an increase in the solution s ph values at ph 3 the maximum adsorption capacities obtained were 145 mg g and 83 mg g of phe and nap respectively 187 the decrease in pahs removal might be attributed to oh ions and pahs competing for adsorption sites at high ph weakening electrostatic attraction among adsorbate adsorbents 176 187 albayati kalash estimated the highest removal efficiency of nap while maintaining ph 4 with the jump in ph from 5 to 10 efficiency was reduced from 90 6 to 75 and 74 67 to 62 66 for functionalized mcm 41 and non calcined mcm 41 respectively the reduction in removal efficiency might be due to interaction between nap electrons and positively charged functional groups of functionalized mcm 41 6 gupta reported maximum phe adsorption at low ph and minimum at high ph values at neutral ph the adsorption efficiency of phe was constant due to the presence of very minimal influence of h and oh ions on the adsorbent surface 91 additionally puszkarewicz jadwiga reported that in an alkaline ph 8 9 and 10 the pah removal using ac was weaker due to the electrostatic repulsion negative charges adsorbent and adsorbate surfaces 188 wijayaratne means studied the effect of ph on adsorption the study observed decreased adsorption when ambient ph 8 01 was increased to 9 0 or decreased to 5 0 the decline in adsorption was due to the changes in the polymeric structure of colloids during ph alteration 189 in contrast to other studies guo et al found no significant variation in adsorption of phe using mbc and bc for a ph range from 2 to 11 1 the reason might be phe did not get ionized in water solution due to its inert nature and did not show any charged area additionally h only attaches to bc at low ph by electrostatic forces since the bc had a ph of 4 32 and mbc with a ph of 3 71 shows positive charges no adsorption changed thus ph was not a significant deciding component for pah adsorption 1 similarly hu et al found no significant ph 3 0 11 0 impact on phe adsorption using hydrophobic molecular sieve mcm 41 168 using ac rad et al investigated the effect of ph on the adsorption rate of phe the initial value of phe were 5 10 20 30 and 40 ppm the adsorbent dosage of 0 3 g 100 ml and the ph range of 3 11 was used in a series of tests all of the experiments were carried out for a contact time of 17 h at ph 7 the highest adsorption capacity was achieved 186 these studies observed no significant negligible impact of ph variation on pahs adsorption additional experiments have to be carried out to understand the effect of ph on pahs adsorption thoroughly 4 5 temperature the effect of solution temperature on pahs adsorption relies upon biochar physicochemical characteristics the removal rate of pahs will increase with a rise in the temperature of the solution 190 the adsorption capacity decreases when a specific temperature as high temperature degrades the stability of adsorption sites on the biochar surface 191 high agglomeration rates experienced by an adsorbent at a raised temperature brought about a decrease in adsorption efficiency von t hoff is used to describe the effect of temperature on pahs adsorption eq 2 2 ln k eq h rt s r where t is the absolute temperature k δh is enthalpy change kj mol r is gas constant δs is entropy change kj mol k and k eq cm 3 g is the equilibrium partition coefficient at that particular temperature from eq 2 the negative slope δh r indicates the endothermic adsorption process and the positive slope states the exothermic process 192 the adsorption of pahs reduced by average values of 27 3 27 4 and 17 0 for nap pyr and phe respectively when temperature raised from 4 c to 27 c 191 whereas calculating enthalpies of adsorption δh using eq 2 gave negative value indicating exothermic process likewise a declining trend of nap adsorption was observed at temperature variation from 22 to 90 c 193 at high temperatures the adsorption reactions are exothermic henceforth the degree of adsorption increments with a decrease in temperature gupta gupta examined the temperature effects on the adsorption capacity of pahs nap flu and phe by conducting adsorption experiments at 20 30 40 and 50 c pahs removal efficiency increased with the temperature rise which showed that the pahs adsorption on bpab was endothermic 185 similarly balati et al showed high pahs adsorption capacity from wastewater using nh2 sba 15 with increment in temperature the positive enthalpy values showed that the pahs adsorption on nh2 sba 15 was endothermic 181 using eq 2 in contrast with the previous studies xu et al reported that pahs total removal efficiency decreases from 51 0 to 29 4 with the rise in temperature from 90 to 150 c the decrease in removal efficiency was because the van der waals forces between the molecules fell with the temperature rise destroying the pahs adsorption dynamic equilibrium and increasing pahs molecules removal from the ac s adsorption site 194 y sun et al obtained a similar observation that pahs adsorption nap ant and pyr on graphene inhibited by temperature rise 143 similarly hiller et al studied the effect of temperature on pahs distribution results indicated that with the temperature increment from 4 to 27 c the extent of pahs adsorption decreased by 27 3 17 0 and 27 4 for nap phe and pyr respectively 191 various studies have shown that pahs adsorption on adsorbents is spontaneous and an exothermic process the increasing temperature would decrease adsorption 143 192 194 4 6 adsorbate concentrations with an increase in pahs concentration pahs adsorption increases up to an optimum value and decreases afterwards as the pah concentration increased most of the active sites were filled therefore it was difficult for adsorbate to utilize the remaining active sites 57 gupta experimented with phe adsorption using ac produced from orange rind for phe adsorption with 10 50 mg l concentrations the results showed increased adsorption capacity of adsorbent with increased pahs concentrations 91 besides gupta gupta studied the adsorption of pahs using ac produced from banana peel for different pahs concentrations 5 10 mg l a comparable outcome was distributed by gong et al the study examined utilizing different oil solutions resulting in varying pahs concentrations a high initial concentration of pahs showed positive effects the accessibility of more pahs to interact with ac s active sites might be the reason for the positive impact 96 furthermore owabora et al showed that nap removal efficiency improves with the rise in its concentration the higher pahs dose provided a large surface area leading to more accessibility of the adsorbent for the nap solution 176 xu et al found that the pahs removal efficiency using ac increased from 29 3 41 1 with the increased pahs concentration in the flue gas from 1 5 to 3 5 μg m3 the increase in removal efficiency can be attributed to the rise in the significant collision of ac and pahs molecules which increases the pah molecule s mass transfer at the ac surface 194 similarly ping et al showed that phe adsorption capacity increased with the rise in initial pahs concentration 195 furthermore hall et al reported that ant adsorption capacity onto silica gel increased 0 178 1 296 mg g for the rise in initial concentration 0 376 1 795 mg l 196 costa et al showed that the amount of pahs adsorbed using si mcm 41 increased with the increase in initial pahs concentrations 4 these results were explained as the adsorption occurs majorly at si mcm 41 outermost surface and relocation towards destinations more profound inside the mesoporous material at higher initial pahs concentrations 197 4 6 1 adsorption isotherms investigation of adsorption equilibrium is a significant advance in examining the process of adsorption it is conceivable to recognize the correlation between the adsorbed analyte and the amount present in the solution after attaining the equilibrium 198 an adsorption isotherm curve explains substance movement from an aqueous environment to a solid phase maintaining stable conditions many studies have used linear and non linear models such as langmuir freundlich redlich peterson temkin and linear to understand the interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate isotherm models langmuir freundlich redlich peterson temkin and linear isotherm models are used to decide the pahs adsorption limit of the adsorbents and comprehend the complex mechanisms involved in the adsorption process the experimental data in pahs adsorption fit well with the langmuir isotherm for low values of equilibrium adsorbent concentrations indicating that the adsorption process occurs as a monolayer phenomenon 1 4 6 198 however at high concentrations adsorption was found to be heterogeneous 90 and multilayer mechanism and best characterized by the freundlich temkin and redlich peterson model an unrealistic asymptotic behavior was found for an intermediate adsorbate concentration and the dubinin radushkevich isotherm better suited the experimental data as a result it does not forecast henry s laws under low pressure 198 few studies on pahs adsorption on various adsorbents with different isotherms have been mentioned in table 6 4 7 adsorbent dose adsorption is a surface phenomenon and directly correlates to the available area for contact the removal percentage of pahs increases with an increase in the adsorbent dose fig 3 with a high adsorbent dose the surface area of the adsorbent increases and extensive adsorbent site availability results in high pahs adsorption albayati kalash studied the removal efficiency of nap the efficiency increases from 49 2 68 6 and 74 100 when the adsorbent dose increases from 0 01 0 1 g for non calcined and functionalized mcm 41 respectively the incremented contact area and the accessibility of more adsorption active sites resulted in higher removal capacity as the adsorbent concentration increased 6 puszkarewicz reported a linear relationship between adsorbent dosage and adsorption efficiency the nap adsorption efficiency of 95 and 94 were obtained for a dose of 3 0 g dm3 of dto i and ag 5 carbons respectively 188 more readily sites were accessible on the adsorbent surface increasing its dose 35 57 guo et al reported that increasing the bc dose increases the rate of pahs removal maximum phe reduction 85 was achieved with an adsorbent dosage of 2 0 mg and remains stable at higher doses excessive adsorbent dosage caused aggregation problems as a result the binding sites and adsorbent surface area were reduced while the diffusional path length was increased 1 199 these studies observed that adsorbent dose influences pahs adsorption significantly however the effect lessens as the dosage is raised the possibility of higher aggregation as the adsorbent dosage increases limiting the number of active sites accessible for adsorption results in a decrease in pahs adsorption 97 99 fig 4 shows the trend of pahs removal as the adsorbent dose increases the x axis represents normalized dosage the dosage increase in each experiment has been represented as a multiple of the initial dosage following are the initial dosages for the various experiments depicted in the diagram 185 1 093 mg 200 10 mg and 201 49 mg the graph depicts the trend caused by the dosage increase the removal rate initially increases and then reaches a maximum limit 4 8 contact time higher pahs adsorption has been reported with an increase in contact time it can be attributed to the higher amount of adsorbent migrating when subjected to longer adsorption time 202 zeledón toruño et al performed an experiment using pyr b k fl b a p b ghi p and flu with pahs initial concentration as 100 mg l and observed 70 pahs removal efficiency with 2 h of contact time the removal efficiency gradually improved with an increment in contact time and the equilibrium was obtained within 24 h with the highest uptake efficiency of 82 for pyr b k fl b a p and b ghi p and 78 4 for flu 203 hu et al reported that the adsorption rate rapidly increased during the initial 20 min and reached equilibrium slowly after 1 h on phe adsorption using mesoporous molecular sieve mcm 41 168 no significant adsorption change was observed until 2 h it might be due to the repulsive forces between adsorbate molecules and adsorbents at equilibrium make it challenging to fill the remaining positions albayati kalash investigated the removal efficiency of nap using non calcined mcm 41 nap adsorption was increased rapidly for the initial 10 min and gradually attained equilibrium after 20 min albayati kalash also reported that the nap adsorption increased rapidly for the first 10 min and gradually up to 50 min while using functionalized mcm 41 as an adsorbent 6 rinawati et al inferred that phe and fl adsorption increases with time and attain equilibrium after 60 min and 30 min respectively adsorption capacity increase with time might be due to enhanced pahs diffusion onto the adsorbent surface 57 4 9 adsorption kinetics it is necessary to optimize the time required for adsorption equilibrium to design effective adsorption systems the adsorption rate of pahs on adsorbent surfaces is an important parameter to determine the shortest time needed to achieve adsorption equilibrium several kinetic models including pseudo first order kinetics pseudo second order kinetics intra particle diffusion and elovich kinetic models have been reported in the literature to determine the behavior of pah molecules on the porous adsorbent surfaces in most studies it was reported that the pseudo first order equation does not perform accurately for the total span of contact time a pseudo first order is applicable mainly for the first 20 30 min of the adsorption process the pseudo second order equation is the most suitable for chemisorption processes as it provides a higher degree of correlation 181 204 pseudo second order kinetics models perform best with several adsorbents such as ac 202 walnut shell based ac 187 zeolite 205 and modified periodic mesoporous organo silica 198 reported studies on pahs adsorption on various adsorbents with different kinetics models and the effect of process parameters on pahs adsorption have been summarized in table 7 and table 8 respectively 5 conclusions and future recommendations pahs are toxic and it is essential to remove them from wastewater and contaminated soil adsorption is the most widely used pahs removal technique due to its high removal efficiency low cost and recyclable material usage also adsorption does not produce any secondary pollutants and effectively treats contaminants of all concentrations the study foumd that the efficiency of the adsorption process is determined not only by the characteristics of the adsorption media and adsorbate but also by operating parameters such as ph solubility temperature and contact time in addition adsorption capacity is more significant when adsorbents are produced at higher temperatures furthermore studies have shown that 100 removal efficiency can be achieved by using suitable adsorbent media and operating variables a increasing the salinity or decreasing the solubility of the aqueous solution increases the adsorption efficiency of the adsorbent b the effect of ph and temperature on adsorption is not understood completely and further investigations are required c the adsorption capacity increases with an increase in contact time until equilibrium after which contact does not affect adsorption capacity d an increase in concentrations of either the adsorbate or the adsorbent positively impacts adsorption efficiency material performance and cost efficiency are the most important parameters for developing carbon and non carbon based materials for wastewater treatment and industrial applications therefore further investigation is needed into physicochemical properties suitability and regeneration capability to improve an adsorbent s structural stability and compliance for pahs polluted water greener methods for producing carbonaceous and non carbonaceous materials with high selectivity capacity and affinity for wastewater treatment are urgently required therefore a purpose directed risk based sustainable remediation method is pivotal for appropriately managing severely pahs polluted water credit authorship contribution statement

13054,to gain a deeper understanding of the roles of n doping in nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi based catalysts for persulfate based advanced oxidation processes aops five catalysts biochar bc n doped biochar nbc nzvi nzvi loaded pristine biochar nzvi bc and nzvi loaded n doped biochar nzvi nbc were prepared for peroxydisulfate pds activation to degrade bisphenol a bpa because of the synergy between nzvi and nbc nzvi nbc exhibited a better catalytic ability and possessed more active species in pds activation mechanisms were proposed including radical pathways ho and so4 and nonradical pathways 1o2 pds activation by fe0 generated radicals while graphitic n pyridinic n and co in nzvi nbc were employed for 1o2 generation in addition nzvi nbc showed a high anti interference capacity and stability the analysis of the intermediates produced by the degradation of bpa confirmed that ho so4 and 1o2 are involved in the reaction of the nzvi nbc system our research provides a new perspective on the synergistic effect of nzvi and n doped materials in aops for endocrine disrupter degradation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords persulfate nitrogen doped biochar nanoscale zero valent iron nonradical pathway singlet oxygen 1o2 1 introduction persulfate based aops have been widely applied due to their simple operation high redox potential and good environmental adaptability 1 hydroxyl radical ho and sulfate radicals so4 have high oxidation potential and play dominant role in the pollutant degradation by radical based aops unfortunately radical based aops exhibit low anti interference capacity toward environmental factors which limits their potential in practical application to a certain degree 2 3 since nonradical reactive oxygen species ros are barely disturbed by coexisting components nonradical based aops attracted increasing attention 4 5 as a typical nonradical ros 1o2 has strong environmental adaptability and pollutant selectivity but 1o2 has a lower redox potential 1o2 e0 0 81 ev than free radicals oh e0 2 8 ev so4 e0 2 6 ev 6 7 therefore a single nonradical pathway was not sufficient for aqueous environmental remediation combining radical and nonradical pathways in persulfate based aops is considered to be a feasible practical application method due to its nontoxicity and high activity the fenton reaction is widely used in the remediation of aquatic environments however the production of iron sludge has been shown to reduce the degradation performance and inhibit the reaction 8 9 nzvi is an economical and environmentally friendly material that is widely used in environmental remediation 10 several studies have illustrated that nzvi shows better performance than the fenton reaction in aops 11 12 unfortunately the aggregation and instability of nzvi limits its practical application using bc as the carrier to prepare nzvi bc composites can improve the dispersibility and oxidation resistance of nzvi 13 14 however bc obtained by direct pyrolysis of biomass has weak intrinsic activity and has difficulty effectively activating pds in the existing research bc only served as a carrier rather than a catalytic material in nzvi bc composites 15 n doping is considered to be an efficient method to strengthen the performance of carbon based catalysts 16 17 through simple thermal pyrolysis n doped carbon material can be obtained the doped n atoms optimize the reaction activity of the catalyst toward persulfate by adjusting the electronic distribution of the carbon surface and providing a number of new active sites 18 19 the introduced n species are generally considered to be the active sites for 1o2 generation 15 a study by zhu and colleagues suggested that 1o2 was the dominant ros in a nitrogen doped carbon activated persulfate system 20 liu et al demonstrated that graphitic n and pyridinic n perform a critical role in persulfate activation following a nonradical mechanism 21 compared with bc nbc exhibited higher catalytic performance for persulfate activation to degrade pollutants 22 however the separability and catalytic activity of n doped carbon materials are still poor making them difficult to apply in practice using nbc as carriers for nzvi stabilization to prepare magnetic composites can effectively avoid cumbersome separation processes nbc with its rich surface structure can provide a large number of sites to load nzvi in previous studies the nzvi bc pds system was found to be dominated by radical pathways producing so4 and oh 23 24 the introduction of n atoms can enrich the number of active sites on the nzvi bc surface thereby enriching the ros of the system fe n co modified biochar has been reported to activate persulfate for environmental remediation 25 however research on the role of n doping in the mechanism of persulfate activation is limited for nzvi carbon composites the effect of n doped carbon on their catalytic activity anti interference ability and mechanism has rarely been studied in this study nbc was used as the carrier of nzvi to prepare nzvi nbc the effect of n doping synergy with nzvi on pds activation to degrade bpa was explored the morphology and properties of the obtained materials were examined using emission scanning electron microscopy sem x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps through characterization analysis quenching experiments electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis and oxidant consumption monitoring the main ros and the mechanism of pds activation in the nzvi nbc pds system were elucidated this study can contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism of n doping in nzvi biochar composites and supply technical support for nzvi biochar composite driven peroxydisulfate activation in practical remediation of organic pollutants 2 experimental 2 1 materials and characterization for information about reagents please refer to supplementary information si text s1 detailed information on several technologies for characterizing synthesized catalyst is provided in si text s2 2 2 synthesis of catalysts the preparation of the nzvi nbc composite and other catalysts is documented in si text s3 2 3 experimental procedure the experiments to evaluate the performance of the synthesized materials were carried out at room temperature in the laboratory the reaction solution was 100 ml of bpa 0 1 mm with an unadjusted initial ph of 7 provided in a 250 ml brown bottle with a stirring speed of 160 rpm the reaction started with the addition of the catalyst 200 mg l and pds 2 mm into the reactor at the same time at each sampling event a sample 1 ml was drawn from the reaction solution immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm hydrophilic membrane and injected into an equal amount of ethanol to terminate the reaction to reduce the error all our experiments were repeated three times and error bars were calculated the aliquots were detected by a waters e8695 alliance hplc instrument waters usa see text s4 for detailed contents a total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu japan was used to verify the mineralization ability of the system the concentration of pds was measured by the iodimetry method 26 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of materials by comparing the sem images of different materials we analyze the effect of n doping and nzvi loading on the surface morphology of the material fig 1 in contrast to the pristine bc which had a smooth surface and no obvious pore structure fig 1a after n doping nbc exhibits obvious stacked sheets and a crumpled scale layer fig 1c which provide suitable sites for nzvi loading it is speculated that dicyandiamide was decomposed during the annealing process and n atoms were incorporated into the carbon network which simultaneously destroyed the surface structure of nbc the loading of nzvi on pristine bc was observed fig 1b obviously due to the lack of attachment sites nzvi gathered together on the bc surface fig 1d shows that the nzvi particles are fixed in the folds and crevices of the nbc surface showing better dispersibility and confirming the nanoscale size of the spherical zvi particle the edx element maps analyzed the distribution of c n o and fe on nzvi nbc proving that each element is uniformly distributed on the surface of nzvi nbc fig 1e for nzvi bc fig s1 the distribution of fe was uneven and aggregated which was consistent with the aforementioned results the crystal structure of the catalysts was analyzed by xrd fig 2a compared with bc the diffraction peak at approximately 25 0 attributed to the amorphous carbon 002 of nbc was significantly shifted and enhanced which was ascribed to the introduction of n atoms increasing the degree of graphitization of the catalyst for nzvi nbc the diffraction peaks located at 44 7 and 63 5 the red diamond were indicative of the 110 and 200 crystal planes of α fe0 27 in addition the peak of magnetite fe3o4 311 was detected at 35 7 black diamond 28 the inevitable oxidation of metallic iron during the experiment and analysis account for the formation of fe3o4 the surface functional groups of the catalysts were determined by ftir spectroscopy as depicted in fig 2c all catalysts had a wide peak at 3446 cm 1 and peaks at 2992 cm 1 and 2852 cm 1 which were attributed to vibrations in oh ch2 and ch3 groups respectively after n doping the new peaks appearing at 2200 cm 1 1605 cm 1 1250 cm 1 and 1694 cm 1 indicated the formation of cn nh cn and co on nzvi nbc 28 30 respectively and the signal at 1115 cm 1 stretching vibrations of coc disappeared 18 combined with edx data analysis the percentage of o atoms on the surface of nzvi nbc was decreased significantly indicating that the doped n atoms replaced some of the o atoms to form new surface functional groups the surface composition of the catalysts was detected by xps the survey scans fig 2b detected the single peak at 284 8 ev 401 2 ev 531 0 ev and a double peak at 711 4 ev and 725 8 ev representing c 1s n 1s o1s and fe 2p in nzvi nbc respectively the xps fe 2p 3 2 peaks of fresh nzvi nbc were fitted into three main peaks which were ascribed to fe0 707 5 ev fe ii 710 7 ev and iii 713 2 ev respectively fig 3a the presence of fe0 peak further substantiated the successful loading of nzvi on nzvi nbc the xps n 1s peaks of nzvi nbc was fitted into four peaks corresponding to oxynitride 403 6 ev graphitic n 400 97 ev pyrrolic n 399 9 ev and pyridinic n 398 2 ev respectively fig 3c 31 32 fig 3d details the content percentages of each n species compared with nbc the proportion of n species did not change significantly in nzvi nbc proving that the process of loading nzvi does not destroy the structure of nbc however the content percentages changed after the reaction indicating that n species participated as the reaction sites in the catalyst the xps c 1s signals of nzvi nbc can be deconvoluted into three main peaks corresponding to graphitic carbon 284 8 ev co c n 286 4 ev and cco 288 1 ev fig 3e 33 34 the results corresponded to the ftir spectrum suggesting that n doping introduced an abundant surface n configuration and oxygen containing functional groups into nzvi nbc moreover the chemical components of different catalysts are summarized in table 1 3 2 evaluation of the nzvi nbc catalytic performance 3 2 1 degradation performance of different systems the degradation and mineralization of bpa was used to evaluate the catalytic performance of different catalysts fig 4a illustrates the bpa degradation and toc removal efficiency of five systems pds only bc pds nbc pds nzvi bc pds and nzvi nbc pds the removal rate of bpa by pds alone was basically negligible which is ascribed to the limited oxidation ability of pds without external activation e0 2 01 v 23 among the catalysts nzvi nbc exhibited the highest catalytic performance in the nzvi nbc pds system bpa was basically removed the mineralization rate reached 80 and kobs was 0 1507 min 1 fig s3a however the nzvi kobs 0 0847 min 1 and nzvi bc kobs 0 0898 min 1 presented relatively limited catalytic performance with 78 and 83 bpa removal rates respectively compared with the pristine bc pds systems the nbc pds system had a better performance in removing bpa demonstrating that the introduction of n atoms can improve the activation ability of the catalyst to a certain degree the activation efficiency of each catalyst toward pds was also evaluated fig s4 among the nzvi based catalysts nzvi nbc has the highest pds activation efficiency in addition xps analysis showed that the composition of n species on the nzvi nbc surface changed significantly after use indicating that n species participated as active sites in the reaction thereby increasing the catalytic performance of the nzvi nbc pds system however the pds activation efficiency of nzvi bc was not significantly improved compared with that of bc this result corresponds to their bpa degradation performance as a carrier pristine bc cannot effectively improve the utilization of nzvi particles and its intrinsic activity is low which limits the improvement of composite material performance in summary nzvi nbc pds can efficiently degrade bpa and the co incorporation of n and fe was beneficial to improve the catalytic performance of the composite 3 2 2 effect of nzvi nbc and pds dosages the effect of catalyst concentration was also studied fig 4b the bpa removal efficiency increased significantly from 50 78 to 100 when nzvi nbc dosage raising from 50 to 200 mg l and kobs increased from 0 0352 to 0 1926 min 1 fig s3b this is because of the limited reactive sites of low concentration nzvi nbc which limited the production of ros for bpa degradation after the catalyst dosage was further increased to 300 400 and 500 mg l the kobs values raised to 0 2204 0 2577 and 0 2803 min 1 respectively fig 4c shows that different initial pds concentrations also affected the removal efficiency of bpa less than 5 of bpa was removed after 120 min when only nzvi nbc was added indicating that adsorption was not the main way to remove bpa in the nzvi nbc system when pds content of 0 5 mm 71 99 bpa was removed and the degradation efficiency increased to 100 with pds dosage of 2 0 mm however the slightly negative effects were observed when the pds content was further up the kobs values was slightly decreased fig s3c the inhibition of degradation is ascribed to the scavenging effect of excessive pds on active radicals eq s1 and self scavenging of so4 eq s2 with regard to economic factors and practical considerations 2 mm pds was the best choice 3 3 reaction mechanism investigation 3 3 1 identification of reactive oxygen species we performed the quenching experiments and epr analysis to reveal the reaction mechanism of the nzvi nbc pds system table s1 lists the rate constants of different radical quenchers we used the second order rate constants of bpa with free radicals were k bpa ho 1 7 1010 m 1 s 1 and k bpa so4 1 3 107 m 1 s 1 with 0 1 mm bpa the rates of ho and so4 were 1 7 106 s 1 and 1 3 103 m 1 s 1 respectively in the quenching experiment the quencher concentrations were set at 100 mm to ensure quenching efficiency as shown in fig 5a after adding ethanol etoh to the nzvi nbc pds system the bpa removal rate dropped by 25 9 in addition the presence of tert butyl alcohol tba reduced the bpa removal rate by 22 7 this result shows that quenching ho and so4 did not completely inhibited the degradation of bpa and it can be inferred that there are other active species present in the nzvi nbc pds system the experiment was also performed in the presence of l histidine 100 mm as 1o2 can be quenched by l histidine the removal efficiency was decreased by 68 when l histidine was added suggesting that 1o2 may be generated in the nzvi nbc system to participate in bpa degradation however recent studies have questioned the use of l histidine as a quencher pointing out that the degradation of organic matter was inhibited because persulfate was directly consumed by l histidine 35 furfuryl alcohol ffa has been proven to be a unique quencher for 1o2 36 experiments were conducted on the bpa degradation by the nzvi nbc system at different ffa concentrations to further confirm the generation of 1o2 the inhibitory effect of ffa on the nzvi nbc pds system increases as the concentration increases the bpa removal rate dropped to 12 with the addition of 100 mm ffa fig 5b although the reaction rate constant of 1o2 with bpa was lower than that of free radicals k bpa 1o2 1 3 107 m 1 s 1 bpa can still be efficiently degraded by 1o2 37 as demonstrated above 1o2 was generated in the nzvi nbc pds system and contributed to the bpa degradation the quenching experiments clearly demonstrated the contribution of ho so4 and 1o2 to bpa degradation suggesting that the process of nzvi nbc activating pds involves both radical and nonradical pathways the significant characteristic peaks corresponding to the signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 conjugates were present in the epr spectrum of the nzvi nbc pds system fig 5c the triplet spectrum of signals corresponding to tempo is attributed to the formation of a temp 1o2 adduct 38 it has been reported that the detection of tempo by epr may not only be related to 1o2 but the presence of dissolved oxygen also causes temp to generate tempo 39 40 to eliminate background effects we set up the pds temp alone as a control group as illustrated in fig 5d a weak triplet signal was observed in the pds alone system however the intensity of the temp 1o2 signal was significantly enhanced in the presence of nzvi nbc suggesting that nzvi nbc activated pds to generate 1o2 the results of epr tests were consistent with the quenching experiments indicating that the nzvi nbc pds system produces nonradical 1o2 radical ho so4 dominated activation pathways for bpa degradation the diversity of activation pathways illustrates the potential synergy between nbc and nzvi 3 3 2 possible catalytic process mechanism the activation pathway of the nzvi nbc pds system has been determined however the function of nzvi and n doping requires further discussion according to previous studies as an fe source the fe2 continuously released by nzvi reacts with pds to generate so4 and ho 41 as shown in fig 5c when dmpo was added the signal in the nbc pds group was not enhanced compared to the signal in the pds only group this result demonstrated that the ability of nbc to activate pds to produce so4 and ho was limited and the radical pathway in the nzvi nbc pds system may be related to nzvi to investigate the radical pathway activation mechanism of nzvi nbc on pds we added nzvi nbc and pds to the solution without bpa fig s5 at different initial concentrations of pds nzvi nbc could consume a certain amount of pds and the consumption was similar that is in the absence of pollutants the fe2 released by nzvi could also consume pds to produce free radicals in the presence of bpa the consumption of so4 and ho was promoted and the pds activation efficiency of the system was also enhanced fig s6 according to the xps fe 2p spectrum the proportion of fe0 and fe2 decreased from 1 94 and 63 80 to 0 48 and 53 35 respectively while the proportion of fe3 increased from 32 24 to 46 14 after the reaction fig 3b therefore these results further verified that the nzvi within nzvi nbc served as the source of fe2 can directly reacted with o2 or pds to produce fe2 the electrons directly transferred from fe2 to pds to generate so4 and ho and fe2 was oxidized to fe3 eqs 1 3 1 fe 0 s 2 o 8 2 fe 2 2so 4 2 2 fe 2 s 2 o 8 2 fe 3 so 4 2 so 4 3 so 4 h 2 o oh so 4 2 h in the nzvi nbc pds system the nzvi has been proven to dominate the formation of free radicals but the generation of nonradical pathway needs further discussion the existence of 1o2 in the nzvi nbc pds system has been proven similar to previous studies n species were introduced after n doping into bc and these species can act as active sites for 1o2 generation 42 43 fig 3d details the n species ratios of used nzvi nbc the decreases in the proportion of pyridinic and graphitic n from 54 11 and 12 32 to 48 77 and 10 00 are observed conversely the proportion of pyrrole n increased from 24 23 to 35 61 this result indicated that pyridinic n and graphitic n were the main reactive n species and the reaction led to the reconstruction of n species to form pyrrole n in previous studies graphitic n has been shown to change the charge distribution of neighboring carbon atoms 44 and the positively charged adjacent carbon causes negatively charged peroxydisulfate ions to lose electrons to produce 1o2 eq 4 45 as the edge nitrogen configuration pyridinic n can change the inert pristine bc electronic properties 46 and form new active sites for redox reactions which can promote the interaction between nzvi nbc and pds the epr spectra of the different catalyst materials were obtained fig s7 the temp 1o2 signals in nzvi bc pds and bc pds systems were weaker than those in the pds alone system suggesting that nzvi bc and bc cannot activate pds to produce additional 1o2 however the typical triple epr signal of temo 1o2 in the nbc pds system was slightly enhanced and it was further enhanced after combining with nzvi it proved that n doping introduced new active sites and formed a synergistic effect with nzvi which induced the pds activation to generate 1o2 in addition the abundant oxygen containing functional groups of carbon based materials such co and coh have also been proven by many studies to be the key for pds activation to produce 1o2 47 48 combining ftir and the xps c 1s high resolution spectrum the proportion of the functional groups of material changed after use only the proportion of graphitic carbon increased from 68 43 to 74 34 whereas cco and co cn decreased from 12 48 and 19 08 to 10 08 and 14 86 respectively fig 3f the co group could adsorb pds molecules and further activate them to produce 1o2 as the eqs 5 6 49 50 the existence of pyridinic n graphitic n and co is the key sites of the nzvi nbc to generate 1o2 from the above the nonradical pathways for generating 1o2 in the system are induced by n doping in conclusion ho so4 and 1o2 are the main ros in the nzvi nbc pds system 4 nzvi nbc so 3 o o so 3 2 nzvi nbc 1 o 2 2so 4 2 5 nzvi nbc o s 2 o 8 2 oh nzvi nbc oh so 3

intermediates p1 13 are summarized in figs s11 13 their transformation processes could be divided into the following five types dehydrogenation hydroxylation isopropylidene bridge cleavage β scission and nonradical pathways fig 6 p1 m z 243 and p2 m z 241 were formed by the hydroxylation and dehydrogenation reactions of bpa the p1 m z 243 produced by the initial electrophilic attack can be quickly decomposed or undergo further hydroxylation and dehydrogenation reaction to produced p1 and p2 which transform into p4 m z 257 through further reaction with free radicals ho and so4 51 the cc bonds between aromatic rings were weakened by the influence of the electron donating hydroxyl moiety and were vulnerable to ho attack and cleavage leading to the opening of the aromatic ring to form p5 m z 183 the ms spectra also identified p6 m z 135 and p7 m z 135 which are generated by the isopropylidene bridge cleavage of bpa at the same time due to the instability of the hydroxylated products they can also be decomposed readily into monocyclic aromatics through the cleavage of isopropylidene bridges 52 the quaternary carbon atom in the bpa center is more preferential for radical attack ho and so4 and a β scission reaction occurs to generate p8 m z 133 which is easily oxidized 37 53 for the nonradical pathway 1o2 molecules were combined with aromatic c in bpa to form unstable bpa 1o2 p 12 m z 258 and then the aromatic ring was broken to form p13 m z 250 the abovementioned intermediates were further oxidized to low molecular weight organics and eventually mineralized completely into co2 and h2o by ros the transformation processes proved that both free radicals and 1o2 were involved in bpa degradation 3 4 influence of experimental factors on bpa degradation 3 4 1 effect of initial solution ph before the experiments the hydrolysis of bpa in the ph range of 3 11 was tested and there was no significant decomposition of bpa table s2 fig 4e shows the bpa removal efficiency of the nzvi nbc pds system at different initial ph values in the initial ph range of 3 7 bpa was completely removed within 60 min the degradation efficiency of the system was inhibited under alkaline conditions fig s8b recorded the ph variation during the reaction of the nzvi nbc pds systems at different initial ph values during the entire reaction the ph value of the system at initial ph of 9 and 11 was maintained above 6 5 and 10 5 respectively the main reason for the inhibition of bpa degradation under alkaline conditions may be the satiability of nzvi 13 under alkaline conditions nzvi is stable with negligible leaching of fe2 and the absence of fe2 leads to the reduction of free radicals generated in the system thereby inhibiting the degradation of bpa in addition so4 would react with ho under alkaline conditions which slowed the bpa degradation eq s3 54 it is worth noting that the removal of bpa in the nzvi bc pds system is completely inhibited under alkaline conditions fig s9 indicating that n doping improves the adaptability of the material under alkaline conditions it could be inferred that the existence of 1o2 compensates for the weak catalytic performance of the radical pathway under alkaline conditions additionally iron leaching of nzvi nbc and nzvi bc at different initial ph values was investigated fig 4f the amount of fe leaching of nzvi nbc was much lower than that of nzvi bc as the initial ph decreased from 7 to 3 the amount of fe leached from nzvi nbc was basically flat and the degradation performance was less affected by ph variation this result was different from the conclusion of previous studies that acidic conditions were more conducive to zvi based catalyst activated persulfate degradation of pollutants than neutral conditions 24 55 this was attributed to the enrichment of nitrogen species in nzvi nbc the electron rich n atoms with lone electron pairs can act as electron donors to capture metal cations fe3 56 which reduce the release speed of active oxide species reduce unnecessary loss of fe species and accelerate fe2 fe3 recycling on the nzvi nbc surface n doping improved the adaptability and reusability of nzvi nbc in various ph ranges 3 4 2 effect of inorganic ions the complex composition of surface water might influence the degradation process by reacting with free radicals or occupying active sites of the catalyst surface 57 the bpa degradation was studied in the nzvi nbc pds system containing different anions fig 4d the existence of cl no3 and so4 2 slightly inhibited the degradation of bpa previous studies demonstrated that a group of cl species cl cl2 cloh and hocl produced by reaction between cl and so4 or oh eqs s4 7 usually has slow reaction rates with most compounds 58 thus reducing the oxidation strength of the system and the utilization of pds the negative influences of no3 and so4 2 are slightly stronger than of cl the kobs of bpa in the presence of no3 and so4 2 were 0 1054 min 1 and 0 1005 min 1 respectively fig s3d although the degradation rate of bpa was affected it could still be completely removed within 90 min previous studies have reported that no3 can react with so4 or oh to form no3 which consumes reactive oxygen species with higher oxidation ability and generates no3 with less reactivity no3 e0 2 0 2 2 ev 59 moreover no3 can oxidize nzvi causing unnecessary consumption of active components and reducing the generation of ros 60 the principle of so4 2 inhibiting the performance of nzvi nbc pds system was similar to that of no3 the existence of so4 2 could reduce the redox potential of so4 so4 2 61 the highly concentrated so4 2 can also react with nzvi on the nzvi nbc surface to form needle like iron oxides which hinder the corrosion of nzvi to release fe2 62 it is well known that the 1o2 produced by the nonradical pathway is barely disturbed by coexisting components 4 13 although the reaction rate of the system in the presence of cl no3 and so4 2 was affected it can still effectively remove bpa indicating that the presence of 1o2 improves the adaptability and degradation performance of the nzvi nbc pds system the presence of hco3 has negative effects on bpa degradation and the removal rate dropped to 62 8 which can be attributed to the following aspects first hco3 could serve as a quencher for so4 and oh and the reaction between them generated less reactive hco3 eqs s8 9 and weakened the ability of the system to degrade bpa 55 in addition the ph of the system rises from 7 0 to 8 3 with the addition of 10 mm hco3 and remained around 8 1 during the reaction due to the buffering effect of hco3 fig s10b when the concentration of hco3 was increased to 100 mm the ph values of the system remained around 8 5 and the inhibition was only slightly enhanced fig s10a as described in section 3 4 1 the performance of the nzvi nbc pds system was significantly inhibited under alkaline conditions these results proved that the alkalinity produced by hco3 is the main factor limiting the degradation performance of the nzvi nbc system 3 5 mineralization reusability and stability of catalysts in order to evaluate the practical applicability of the catalyst the mineralization ability and stability of nzvi nbc were tested and reusability experiments were performed the mineralization ability of nzvi nbc toward bpa was determined by detecting the change in toc in the system compared with the decomposition of bpa the removal of toc was relatively slow fig 7a although bpa was completely degraded within 120 min there was still 2 29 mg l toc in the solution after performing the same reaction operation with nzvi nbc in pds solution without bpa 1 06 mg l toc was detected which demonstrated that the remaining toc in the system was partially composed of soluble carbon and that the bpa mineralization rate was 93 1 the magnetic nzvi nbc composite can be recycled easily by using an external magnetic field the degradation rate of bpa dropped to 71 3 and 69 7 respectively in the second and third reactions fig 7b the weakening of the nzvi nbc pds system performance could stem from a variety of factors including the oxidation and dissolution of nzvi the consumption of n species and the coverage of the by products on the material surface all of which reduce the number of active sites for pds activation the amount of fe leaching at different initial ph values was compared with the total iron content in nzvi nbc 13 57 mg l determined by microwave digestion text s5 when the initial ph was 3 5 7 9 and 11 the amount of fe leached was 14 81 13 71 11 50 4 29 and 0 12 of the total fe content respectively the loading and encapsulation of nzvi nbc to nzvi particles reduced the leaching rate of total iron to a certain extent in general nzvi nbc exhibited good stability and reusability in the nzvi nbc pds system 4 conclusion in this study nzvi nbc was synthesized by loading nzvi on nbc compared with the nzvi pds nbc pds and nzvi bc pds systems the nzvi nbc pds system showed outstanding catalytic performance in removing bpa because of the effect of nzvi synergies with n doping to improve the catalytic activity for pds nbc provided better loading conditions for nzvi particles and reduced the fe leaching of nzvi nbc quenching experiments and epr analysis demonstrated that both radical ho and so4 and nonradical pathways 1o2 are involved in the nzvi nbc pds system characterization analysis revealed that the radical pathway is driven by nzvi and the nonradical pathway corresponds to n doping benefitting from the combination of radical and nonradical pathways the nzvi nbc pds system showed higher resistance to environmental factors than the nzvi bc pds system this study revealed the mechanism of nbc synergy with nzvi particles and demonstrated that the optimization and modification of the carrier is beneficial to optimize the catalytic performance of nzvi

13054,to gain a deeper understanding of the roles of n doping in nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi based catalysts for persulfate based advanced oxidation processes aops five catalysts biochar bc n doped biochar nbc nzvi nzvi loaded pristine biochar nzvi bc and nzvi loaded n doped biochar nzvi nbc were prepared for peroxydisulfate pds activation to degrade bisphenol a bpa because of the synergy between nzvi and nbc nzvi nbc exhibited a better catalytic ability and possessed more active species in pds activation mechanisms were proposed including radical pathways ho and so4 and nonradical pathways 1o2 pds activation by fe0 generated radicals while graphitic n pyridinic n and co in nzvi nbc were employed for 1o2 generation in addition nzvi nbc showed a high anti interference capacity and stability the analysis of the intermediates produced by the degradation of bpa confirmed that ho so4 and 1o2 are involved in the reaction of the nzvi nbc system our research provides a new perspective on the synergistic effect of nzvi and n doped materials in aops for endocrine disrupter degradation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords persulfate nitrogen doped biochar nanoscale zero valent iron nonradical pathway singlet oxygen 1o2 1 introduction persulfate based aops have been widely applied due to their simple operation high redox potential and good environmental adaptability 1 hydroxyl radical ho and sulfate radicals so4 have high oxidation potential and play dominant role in the pollutant degradation by radical based aops unfortunately radical based aops exhibit low anti interference capacity toward environmental factors which limits their potential in practical application to a certain degree 2 3 since nonradical reactive oxygen species ros are barely disturbed by coexisting components nonradical based aops attracted increasing attention 4 5 as a typical nonradical ros 1o2 has strong environmental adaptability and pollutant selectivity but 1o2 has a lower redox potential 1o2 e0 0 81 ev than free radicals oh e0 2 8 ev so4 e0 2 6 ev 6 7 therefore a single nonradical pathway was not sufficient for aqueous environmental remediation combining radical and nonradical pathways in persulfate based aops is considered to be a feasible practical application method due to its nontoxicity and high activity the fenton reaction is widely used in the remediation of aquatic environments however the production of iron sludge has been shown to reduce the degradation performance and inhibit the reaction 8 9 nzvi is an economical and environmentally friendly material that is widely used in environmental remediation 10 several studies have illustrated that nzvi shows better performance than the fenton reaction in aops 11 12 unfortunately the aggregation and instability of nzvi limits its practical application using bc as the carrier to prepare nzvi bc composites can improve the dispersibility and oxidation resistance of nzvi 13 14 however bc obtained by direct pyrolysis of biomass has weak intrinsic activity and has difficulty effectively activating pds in the existing research bc only served as a carrier rather than a catalytic material in nzvi bc composites 15 n doping is considered to be an efficient method to strengthen the performance of carbon based catalysts 16 17 through simple thermal pyrolysis n doped carbon material can be obtained the doped n atoms optimize the reaction activity of the catalyst toward persulfate by adjusting the electronic distribution of the carbon surface and providing a number of new active sites 18 19 the introduced n species are generally considered to be the active sites for 1o2 generation 15 a study by zhu and colleagues suggested that 1o2 was the dominant ros in a nitrogen doped carbon activated persulfate system 20 liu et al demonstrated that graphitic n and pyridinic n perform a critical role in persulfate activation following a nonradical mechanism 21 compared with bc nbc exhibited higher catalytic performance for persulfate activation to degrade pollutants 22 however the separability and catalytic activity of n doped carbon materials are still poor making them difficult to apply in practice using nbc as carriers for nzvi stabilization to prepare magnetic composites can effectively avoid cumbersome separation processes nbc with its rich surface structure can provide a large number of sites to load nzvi in previous studies the nzvi bc pds system was found to be dominated by radical pathways producing so4 and oh 23 24 the introduction of n atoms can enrich the number of active sites on the nzvi bc surface thereby enriching the ros of the system fe n co modified biochar has been reported to activate persulfate for environmental remediation 25 however research on the role of n doping in the mechanism of persulfate activation is limited for nzvi carbon composites the effect of n doped carbon on their catalytic activity anti interference ability and mechanism has rarely been studied in this study nbc was used as the carrier of nzvi to prepare nzvi nbc the effect of n doping synergy with nzvi on pds activation to degrade bpa was explored the morphology and properties of the obtained materials were examined using emission scanning electron microscopy sem x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps through characterization analysis quenching experiments electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis and oxidant consumption monitoring the main ros and the mechanism of pds activation in the nzvi nbc pds system were elucidated this study can contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism of n doping in nzvi biochar composites and supply technical support for nzvi biochar composite driven peroxydisulfate activation in practical remediation of organic pollutants 2 experimental 2 1 materials and characterization for information about reagents please refer to supplementary information si text s1 detailed information on several technologies for characterizing synthesized catalyst is provided in si text s2 2 2 synthesis of catalysts the preparation of the nzvi nbc composite and other catalysts is documented in si text s3 2 3 experimental procedure the experiments to evaluate the performance of the synthesized materials were carried out at room temperature in the laboratory the reaction solution was 100 ml of bpa 0 1 mm with an unadjusted initial ph of 7 provided in a 250 ml brown bottle with a stirring speed of 160 rpm the reaction started with the addition of the catalyst 200 mg l and pds 2 mm into the reactor at the same time at each sampling event a sample 1 ml was drawn from the reaction solution immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm hydrophilic membrane and injected into an equal amount of ethanol to terminate the reaction to reduce the error all our experiments were repeated three times and error bars were calculated the aliquots were detected by a waters e8695 alliance hplc instrument waters usa see text s4 for detailed contents a total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu japan was used to verify the mineralization ability of the system the concentration of pds was measured by the iodimetry method 26 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of materials by comparing the sem images of different materials we analyze the effect of n doping and nzvi loading on the surface morphology of the material fig 1 in contrast to the pristine bc which had a smooth surface and no obvious pore structure fig 1a after n doping nbc exhibits obvious stacked sheets and a crumpled scale layer fig 1c which provide suitable sites for nzvi loading it is speculated that dicyandiamide was decomposed during the annealing process and n atoms were incorporated into the carbon network which simultaneously destroyed the surface structure of nbc the loading of nzvi on pristine bc was observed fig 1b obviously due to the lack of attachment sites nzvi gathered together on the bc surface fig 1d shows that the nzvi particles are fixed in the folds and crevices of the nbc surface showing better dispersibility and confirming the nanoscale size of the spherical zvi particle the edx element maps analyzed the distribution of c n o and fe on nzvi nbc proving that each element is uniformly distributed on the surface of nzvi nbc fig 1e for nzvi bc fig s1 the distribution of fe was uneven and aggregated which was consistent with the aforementioned results the crystal structure of the catalysts was analyzed by xrd fig 2a compared with bc the diffraction peak at approximately 25 0 attributed to the amorphous carbon 002 of nbc was significantly shifted and enhanced which was ascribed to the introduction of n atoms increasing the degree of graphitization of the catalyst for nzvi nbc the diffraction peaks located at 44 7 and 63 5 the red diamond were indicative of the 110 and 200 crystal planes of α fe0 27 in addition the peak of magnetite fe3o4 311 was detected at 35 7 black diamond 28 the inevitable oxidation of metallic iron during the experiment and analysis account for the formation of fe3o4 the surface functional groups of the catalysts were determined by ftir spectroscopy as depicted in fig 2c all catalysts had a wide peak at 3446 cm 1 and peaks at 2992 cm 1 and 2852 cm 1 which were attributed to vibrations in oh ch2 and ch3 groups respectively after n doping the new peaks appearing at 2200 cm 1 1605 cm 1 1250 cm 1 and 1694 cm 1 indicated the formation of cn nh cn and co on nzvi nbc 28 30 respectively and the signal at 1115 cm 1 stretching vibrations of coc disappeared 18 combined with edx data analysis the percentage of o atoms on the surface of nzvi nbc was decreased significantly indicating that the doped n atoms replaced some of the o atoms to form new surface functional groups the surface composition of the catalysts was detected by xps the survey scans fig 2b detected the single peak at 284 8 ev 401 2 ev 531 0 ev and a double peak at 711 4 ev and 725 8 ev representing c 1s n 1s o1s and fe 2p in nzvi nbc respectively the xps fe 2p 3 2 peaks of fresh nzvi nbc were fitted into three main peaks which were ascribed to fe0 707 5 ev fe ii 710 7 ev and iii 713 2 ev respectively fig 3a the presence of fe0 peak further substantiated the successful loading of nzvi on nzvi nbc the xps n 1s peaks of nzvi nbc was fitted into four peaks corresponding to oxynitride 403 6 ev graphitic n 400 97 ev pyrrolic n 399 9 ev and pyridinic n 398 2 ev respectively fig 3c 31 32 fig 3d details the content percentages of each n species compared with nbc the proportion of n species did not change significantly in nzvi nbc proving that the process of loading nzvi does not destroy the structure of nbc however the content percentages changed after the reaction indicating that n species participated as the reaction sites in the catalyst the xps c 1s signals of nzvi nbc can be deconvoluted into three main peaks corresponding to graphitic carbon 284 8 ev co c n 286 4 ev and cco 288 1 ev fig 3e 33 34 the results corresponded to the ftir spectrum suggesting that n doping introduced an abundant surface n configuration and oxygen containing functional groups into nzvi nbc moreover the chemical components of different catalysts are summarized in table 1 3 2 evaluation of the nzvi nbc catalytic performance 3 2 1 degradation performance of different systems the degradation and mineralization of bpa was used to evaluate the catalytic performance of different catalysts fig 4a illustrates the bpa degradation and toc removal efficiency of five systems pds only bc pds nbc pds nzvi bc pds and nzvi nbc pds the removal rate of bpa by pds alone was basically negligible which is ascribed to the limited oxidation ability of pds without external activation e0 2 01 v 23 among the catalysts nzvi nbc exhibited the highest catalytic performance in the nzvi nbc pds system bpa was basically removed the mineralization rate reached 80 and kobs was 0 1507 min 1 fig s3a however the nzvi kobs 0 0847 min 1 and nzvi bc kobs 0 0898 min 1 presented relatively limited catalytic performance with 78 and 83 bpa removal rates respectively compared with the pristine bc pds systems the nbc pds system had a better performance in removing bpa demonstrating that the introduction of n atoms can improve the activation ability of the catalyst to a certain degree the activation efficiency of each catalyst toward pds was also evaluated fig s4 among the nzvi based catalysts nzvi nbc has the highest pds activation efficiency in addition xps analysis showed that the composition of n species on the nzvi nbc surface changed significantly after use indicating that n species participated as active sites in the reaction thereby increasing the catalytic performance of the nzvi nbc pds system however the pds activation efficiency of nzvi bc was not significantly improved compared with that of bc this result corresponds to their bpa degradation performance as a carrier pristine bc cannot effectively improve the utilization of nzvi particles and its intrinsic activity is low which limits the improvement of composite material performance in summary nzvi nbc pds can efficiently degrade bpa and the co incorporation of n and fe was beneficial to improve the catalytic performance of the composite 3 2 2 effect of nzvi nbc and pds dosages the effect of catalyst concentration was also studied fig 4b the bpa removal efficiency increased significantly from 50 78 to 100 when nzvi nbc dosage raising from 50 to 200 mg l and kobs increased from 0 0352 to 0 1926 min 1 fig s3b this is because of the limited reactive sites of low concentration nzvi nbc which limited the production of ros for bpa degradation after the catalyst dosage was further increased to 300 400 and 500 mg l the kobs values raised to 0 2204 0 2577 and 0 2803 min 1 respectively fig 4c shows that different initial pds concentrations also affected the removal efficiency of bpa less than 5 of bpa was removed after 120 min when only nzvi nbc was added indicating that adsorption was not the main way to remove bpa in the nzvi nbc system when pds content of 0 5 mm 71 99 bpa was removed and the degradation efficiency increased to 100 with pds dosage of 2 0 mm however the slightly negative effects were observed when the pds content was further up the kobs values was slightly decreased fig s3c the inhibition of degradation is ascribed to the scavenging effect of excessive pds on active radicals eq s1 and self scavenging of so4 eq s2 with regard to economic factors and practical considerations 2 mm pds was the best choice 3 3 reaction mechanism investigation 3 3 1 identification of reactive oxygen species we performed the quenching experiments and epr analysis to reveal the reaction mechanism of the nzvi nbc pds system table s1 lists the rate constants of different radical quenchers we used the second order rate constants of bpa with free radicals were k bpa ho 1 7 1010 m 1 s 1 and k bpa so4 1 3 107 m 1 s 1 with 0 1 mm bpa the rates of ho and so4 were 1 7 106 s 1 and 1 3 103 m 1 s 1 respectively in the quenching experiment the quencher concentrations were set at 100 mm to ensure quenching efficiency as shown in fig 5a after adding ethanol etoh to the nzvi nbc pds system the bpa removal rate dropped by 25 9 in addition the presence of tert butyl alcohol tba reduced the bpa removal rate by 22 7 this result shows that quenching ho and so4 did not completely inhibited the degradation of bpa and it can be inferred that there are other active species present in the nzvi nbc pds system the experiment was also performed in the presence of l histidine 100 mm as 1o2 can be quenched by l histidine the removal efficiency was decreased by 68 when l histidine was added suggesting that 1o2 may be generated in the nzvi nbc system to participate in bpa degradation however recent studies have questioned the use of l histidine as a quencher pointing out that the degradation of organic matter was inhibited because persulfate was directly consumed by l histidine 35 furfuryl alcohol ffa has been proven to be a unique quencher for 1o2 36 experiments were conducted on the bpa degradation by the nzvi nbc system at different ffa concentrations to further confirm the generation of 1o2 the inhibitory effect of ffa on the nzvi nbc pds system increases as the concentration increases the bpa removal rate dropped to 12 with the addition of 100 mm ffa fig 5b although the reaction rate constant of 1o2 with bpa was lower than that of free radicals k bpa 1o2 1 3 107 m 1 s 1 bpa can still be efficiently degraded by 1o2 37 as demonstrated above 1o2 was generated in the nzvi nbc pds system and contributed to the bpa degradation the quenching experiments clearly demonstrated the contribution of ho so4 and 1o2 to bpa degradation suggesting that the process of nzvi nbc activating pds involves both radical and nonradical pathways the significant characteristic peaks corresponding to the signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 conjugates were present in the epr spectrum of the nzvi nbc pds system fig 5c the triplet spectrum of signals corresponding to tempo is attributed to the formation of a temp 1o2 adduct 38 it has been reported that the detection of tempo by epr may not only be related to 1o2 but the presence of dissolved oxygen also causes temp to generate tempo 39 40 to eliminate background effects we set up the pds temp alone as a control group as illustrated in fig 5d a weak triplet signal was observed in the pds alone system however the intensity of the temp 1o2 signal was significantly enhanced in the presence of nzvi nbc suggesting that nzvi nbc activated pds to generate 1o2 the results of epr tests were consistent with the quenching experiments indicating that the nzvi nbc pds system produces nonradical 1o2 radical ho so4 dominated activation pathways for bpa degradation the diversity of activation pathways illustrates the potential synergy between nbc and nzvi 3 3 2 possible catalytic process mechanism the activation pathway of the nzvi nbc pds system has been determined however the function of nzvi and n doping requires further discussion according to previous studies as an fe source the fe2 continuously released by nzvi reacts with pds to generate so4 and ho 41 as shown in fig 5c when dmpo was added the signal in the nbc pds group was not enhanced compared to the signal in the pds only group this result demonstrated that the ability of nbc to activate pds to produce so4 and ho was limited and the radical pathway in the nzvi nbc pds system may be related to nzvi to investigate the radical pathway activation mechanism of nzvi nbc on pds we added nzvi nbc and pds to the solution without bpa fig s5 at different initial concentrations of pds nzvi nbc could consume a certain amount of pds and the consumption was similar that is in the absence of pollutants the fe2 released by nzvi could also consume pds to produce free radicals in the presence of bpa the consumption of so4 and ho was promoted and the pds activation efficiency of the system was also enhanced fig s6 according to the xps fe 2p spectrum the proportion of fe0 and fe2 decreased from 1 94 and 63 80 to 0 48 and 53 35 respectively while the proportion of fe3 increased from 32 24 to 46 14 after the reaction fig 3b therefore these results further verified that the nzvi within nzvi nbc served as the source of fe2 can directly reacted with o2 or pds to produce fe2 the electrons directly transferred from fe2 to pds to generate so4 and ho and fe2 was oxidized to fe3 eqs 1 3 1 fe 0 s 2 o 8 2 fe 2 2so 4 2 2 fe 2 s 2 o 8 2 fe 3 so 4 2 so 4 3 so 4 h 2 o oh so 4 2 h in the nzvi nbc pds system the nzvi has been proven to dominate the formation of free radicals but the generation of nonradical pathway needs further discussion the existence of 1o2 in the nzvi nbc pds system has been proven similar to previous studies n species were introduced after n doping into bc and these species can act as active sites for 1o2 generation 42 43 fig 3d details the n species ratios of used nzvi nbc the decreases in the proportion of pyridinic and graphitic n from 54 11 and 12 32 to 48 77 and 10 00 are observed conversely the proportion of pyrrole n increased from 24 23 to 35 61 this result indicated that pyridinic n and graphitic n were the main reactive n species and the reaction led to the reconstruction of n species to form pyrrole n in previous studies graphitic n has been shown to change the charge distribution of neighboring carbon atoms 44 and the positively charged adjacent carbon causes negatively charged peroxydisulfate ions to lose electrons to produce 1o2 eq 4 45 as the edge nitrogen configuration pyridinic n can change the inert pristine bc electronic properties 46 and form new active sites for redox reactions which can promote the interaction between nzvi nbc and pds the epr spectra of the different catalyst materials were obtained fig s7 the temp 1o2 signals in nzvi bc pds and bc pds systems were weaker than those in the pds alone system suggesting that nzvi bc and bc cannot activate pds to produce additional 1o2 however the typical triple epr signal of temo 1o2 in the nbc pds system was slightly enhanced and it was further enhanced after combining with nzvi it proved that n doping introduced new active sites and formed a synergistic effect with nzvi which induced the pds activation to generate 1o2 in addition the abundant oxygen containing functional groups of carbon based materials such co and coh have also been proven by many studies to be the key for pds activation to produce 1o2 47 48 combining ftir and the xps c 1s high resolution spectrum the proportion of the functional groups of material changed after use only the proportion of graphitic carbon increased from 68 43 to 74 34 whereas cco and co cn decreased from 12 48 and 19 08 to 10 08 and 14 86 respectively fig 3f the co group could adsorb pds molecules and further activate them to produce 1o2 as the eqs 5 6 49 50 the existence of pyridinic n graphitic n and co is the key sites of the nzvi nbc to generate 1o2 from the above the nonradical pathways for generating 1o2 in the system are induced by n doping in conclusion ho so4 and 1o2 are the main ros in the nzvi nbc pds system 4 nzvi nbc so 3 o o so 3 2 nzvi nbc 1 o 2 2so 4 2 5 nzvi nbc o s 2 o 8 2 oh nzvi nbc oh so 3

intermediates p1 13 are summarized in figs s11 13 their transformation processes could be divided into the following five types dehydrogenation hydroxylation isopropylidene bridge cleavage β scission and nonradical pathways fig 6 p1 m z 243 and p2 m z 241 were formed by the hydroxylation and dehydrogenation reactions of bpa the p1 m z 243 produced by the initial electrophilic attack can be quickly decomposed or undergo further hydroxylation and dehydrogenation reaction to produced p1 and p2 which transform into p4 m z 257 through further reaction with free radicals ho and so4 51 the cc bonds between aromatic rings were weakened by the influence of the electron donating hydroxyl moiety and were vulnerable to ho attack and cleavage leading to the opening of the aromatic ring to form p5 m z 183 the ms spectra also identified p6 m z 135 and p7 m z 135 which are generated by the isopropylidene bridge cleavage of bpa at the same time due to the instability of the hydroxylated products they can also be decomposed readily into monocyclic aromatics through the cleavage of isopropylidene bridges 52 the quaternary carbon atom in the bpa center is more preferential for radical attack ho and so4 and a β scission reaction occurs to generate p8 m z 133 which is easily oxidized 37 53 for the nonradical pathway 1o2 molecules were combined with aromatic c in bpa to form unstable bpa 1o2 p 12 m z 258 and then the aromatic ring was broken to form p13 m z 250 the abovementioned intermediates were further oxidized to low molecular weight organics and eventually mineralized completely into co2 and h2o by ros the transformation processes proved that both free radicals and 1o2 were involved in bpa degradation 3 4 influence of experimental factors on bpa degradation 3 4 1 effect of initial solution ph before the experiments the hydrolysis of bpa in the ph range of 3 11 was tested and there was no significant decomposition of bpa table s2 fig 4e shows the bpa removal efficiency of the nzvi nbc pds system at different initial ph values in the initial ph range of 3 7 bpa was completely removed within 60 min the degradation efficiency of the system was inhibited under alkaline conditions fig s8b recorded the ph variation during the reaction of the nzvi nbc pds systems at different initial ph values during the entire reaction the ph value of the system at initial ph of 9 and 11 was maintained above 6 5 and 10 5 respectively the main reason for the inhibition of bpa degradation under alkaline conditions may be the satiability of nzvi 13 under alkaline conditions nzvi is stable with negligible leaching of fe2 and the absence of fe2 leads to the reduction of free radicals generated in the system thereby inhibiting the degradation of bpa in addition so4 would react with ho under alkaline conditions which slowed the bpa degradation eq s3 54 it is worth noting that the removal of bpa in the nzvi bc pds system is completely inhibited under alkaline conditions fig s9 indicating that n doping improves the adaptability of the material under alkaline conditions it could be inferred that the existence of 1o2 compensates for the weak catalytic performance of the radical pathway under alkaline conditions additionally iron leaching of nzvi nbc and nzvi bc at different initial ph values was investigated fig 4f the amount of fe leaching of nzvi nbc was much lower than that of nzvi bc as the initial ph decreased from 7 to 3 the amount of fe leached from nzvi nbc was basically flat and the degradation performance was less affected by ph variation this result was different from the conclusion of previous studies that acidic conditions were more conducive to zvi based catalyst activated persulfate degradation of pollutants than neutral conditions 24 55 this was attributed to the enrichment of nitrogen species in nzvi nbc the electron rich n atoms with lone electron pairs can act as electron donors to capture metal cations fe3 56 which reduce the release speed of active oxide species reduce unnecessary loss of fe species and accelerate fe2 fe3 recycling on the nzvi nbc surface n doping improved the adaptability and reusability of nzvi nbc in various ph ranges 3 4 2 effect of inorganic ions the complex composition of surface water might influence the degradation process by reacting with free radicals or occupying active sites of the catalyst surface 57 the bpa degradation was studied in the nzvi nbc pds system containing different anions fig 4d the existence of cl no3 and so4 2 slightly inhibited the degradation of bpa previous studies demonstrated that a group of cl species cl cl2 cloh and hocl produced by reaction between cl and so4 or oh eqs s4 7 usually has slow reaction rates with most compounds 58 thus reducing the oxidation strength of the system and the utilization of pds the negative influences of no3 and so4 2 are slightly stronger than of cl the kobs of bpa in the presence of no3 and so4 2 were 0 1054 min 1 and 0 1005 min 1 respectively fig s3d although the degradation rate of bpa was affected it could still be completely removed within 90 min previous studies have reported that no3 can react with so4 or oh to form no3 which consumes reactive oxygen species with higher oxidation ability and generates no3 with less reactivity no3 e0 2 0 2 2 ev 59 moreover no3 can oxidize nzvi causing unnecessary consumption of active components and reducing the generation of ros 60 the principle of so4 2 inhibiting the performance of nzvi nbc pds system was similar to that of no3 the existence of so4 2 could reduce the redox potential of so4 so4 2 61 the highly concentrated so4 2 can also react with nzvi on the nzvi nbc surface to form needle like iron oxides which hinder the corrosion of nzvi to release fe2 62 it is well known that the 1o2 produced by the nonradical pathway is barely disturbed by coexisting components 4 13 although the reaction rate of the system in the presence of cl no3 and so4 2 was affected it can still effectively remove bpa indicating that the presence of 1o2 improves the adaptability and degradation performance of the nzvi nbc pds system the presence of hco3 has negative effects on bpa degradation and the removal rate dropped to 62 8 which can be attributed to the following aspects first hco3 could serve as a quencher for so4 and oh and the reaction between them generated less reactive hco3 eqs s8 9 and weakened the ability of the system to degrade bpa 55 in addition the ph of the system rises from 7 0 to 8 3 with the addition of 10 mm hco3 and remained around 8 1 during the reaction due to the buffering effect of hco3 fig s10b when the concentration of hco3 was increased to 100 mm the ph values of the system remained around 8 5 and the inhibition was only slightly enhanced fig s10a as described in section 3 4 1 the performance of the nzvi nbc pds system was significantly inhibited under alkaline conditions these results proved that the alkalinity produced by hco3 is the main factor limiting the degradation performance of the nzvi nbc system 3 5 mineralization reusability and stability of catalysts in order to evaluate the practical applicability of the catalyst the mineralization ability and stability of nzvi nbc were tested and reusability experiments were performed the mineralization ability of nzvi nbc toward bpa was determined by detecting the change in toc in the system compared with the decomposition of bpa the removal of toc was relatively slow fig 7a although bpa was completely degraded within 120 min there was still 2 29 mg l toc in the solution after performing the same reaction operation with nzvi nbc in pds solution without bpa 1 06 mg l toc was detected which demonstrated that the remaining toc in the system was partially composed of soluble carbon and that the bpa mineralization rate was 93 1 the magnetic nzvi nbc composite can be recycled easily by using an external magnetic field the degradation rate of bpa dropped to 71 3 and 69 7 respectively in the second and third reactions fig 7b the weakening of the nzvi nbc pds system performance could stem from a variety of factors including the oxidation and dissolution of nzvi the consumption of n species and the coverage of the by products on the material surface all of which reduce the number of active sites for pds activation the amount of fe leaching at different initial ph values was compared with the total iron content in nzvi nbc 13 57 mg l determined by microwave digestion text s5 when the initial ph was 3 5 7 9 and 11 the amount of fe leached was 14 81 13 71 11 50 4 29 and 0 12 of the total fe content respectively the loading and encapsulation of nzvi nbc to nzvi particles reduced the leaching rate of total iron to a certain extent in general nzvi nbc exhibited good stability and reusability in the nzvi nbc pds system 4 conclusion in this study nzvi nbc was synthesized by loading nzvi on nbc compared with the nzvi pds nbc pds and nzvi bc pds systems the nzvi nbc pds system showed outstanding catalytic performance in removing bpa because of the effect of nzvi synergies with n doping to improve the catalytic activity for pds nbc provided better loading conditions for nzvi particles and reduced the fe leaching of nzvi nbc quenching experiments and epr analysis demonstrated that both radical ho and so4 and nonradical pathways 1o2 are involved in the nzvi nbc pds system characterization analysis revealed that the radical pathway is driven by nzvi and the nonradical pathway corresponds to n doping benefitting from the combination of radical and nonradical pathways the nzvi nbc pds system showed higher resistance to environmental factors than the nzvi bc pds system this study revealed the mechanism of nbc synergy with nzvi particles and demonstrated that the optimization and modification of the carrier is beneficial to optimize the catalytic performance of nzvi
