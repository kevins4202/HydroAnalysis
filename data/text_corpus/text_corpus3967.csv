19835,microplastics are anthropogenic contaminants which have been found in oceans lakes and rivers investigations focusing on drinking water are rare and studies have mainly been using micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy μ ft ir a major limitation of this technique is its inability to detect particles smaller than 20 μm however micro raman spectroscopy is capable of detecting even smaller particle sizes therefore we show that this technique which was used in this study is particularly useful in detecting microplastics in drinking water where particle sizes are in the low micrometer range in our study we compared the results from drinking water distributed in plastic bottles glass bottles and beverage cartons we tested the microplastic content of water from 22 different returnable and single use plastic bottles 3 beverage cartons and 9 glass bottles obtained from grocery stores in germany small 50 500 μm and very small 1 50 μm microplastic fragments were found in every type of water interestingly almost 80 of all microplastic particles found had a particle size between 5 and 20 μm and were therefore not detectable by the analytical techniques used in previous studies the average microplastics content was 118 88 particles l in returnable but only 14 14 particles l in single use plastic bottles the microplastics content in the beverage cartons was only 11 8 particles l contrary to our assumptions we found high amounts of plastic particles in some of the glass bottled waters range 0 253 particles l mean 50 52 particles l a statistically significant difference from the blank value 14 13 to the investigated packaging types could only be shown comparing to the returnable bottles p 0 05 most of the particles in water from returnable plastic bottles were identified as consisting of polyester primary polyethylene terephthalate pet 84 and polypropylene pp 7 this is not surprising since the bottles are made of pet and the caps are made of pp in water from single use plastic bottles only a few micro pet particles have been found in the water from beverage cartons and also from glass bottles microplastic particles other than pet were found for example polyethylene or polyolefins this can be explained by the fact that beverage cartons are coated with polyethylene foils and caps are treated with lubricants therefore these findings indicate that the packaging itself may release microparticles the main fraction of the microplastic particles identified are of very small size with dimensions less than 20 μm which is not detectable with the μ ft ir technique used in previous studies graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic mineral water micro raman spectroscopy beverages bottled water 1 introduction microplastic contamination is receiving increased attention and the impact on the environment but also on food has become evident in the early seventies the tiny plastic pieces were reported for the first time being present in the atlantic carpenter et al 1972 carpenter and smith 1972 colton et al 1974 since then a constant increase of microplastic pollution in marine waters has been observed thompson et al 2004 in recent years an increasing number of studies revealing the presence of microplastic particles in fresh water from sources such as lakes and rivers ivleva et al 2017 mccormick et al 2016 sruthy and ramasamy 2017 as well as in the atmosphere cai et al 2017 dris et al 2016 were reported in addition to the marine microplastics input into our diet by consuming fish and seafood cole et al 2013 davison and asch 2011 that may be contaminated by leaking pollutants and additives in microplastic bakir et al 2014 mato et al 2001 the direct exposure of microplastics by humans via other sources especially such as drinkable water needs to be considered currently there is almost no published data on the microplastics content of drinking or mineral water available a publication about synthetic particles in german beers liebezeit and liebezeit 2014 has been discussed lachenmeier et al 2015 wiesheu et al 2016 in this context one type of beer and one sample of bottled mineral water was analyzed by means of μ raman spectroscopy the authors found fibers in the blank and the beverage samples but the results did not show statistically significant differences wiesheu et al 2016 in the study by wiesheu et al 2016 only one single pet fiber was found in one of the water samples but no statements about the total amount of other fibers or particles were made the study also didn t reveal anything about the type of water or the type of packaging the authors recommended further analysis of fiber content in different beverages and investigations of the sources of contamination pointing out the importance of working under extremely clean conditions in order to reduce contamination of the samples the helmholtz center for polar and marine research alfred wegener institute bremerhaven germany investigated a total of 40 000 l raw and tap water in lower saxony by means of μ ft ir mintenig et al 2014 in four blind samples fiber concentrations comparable to the other raw and drinking water samples were detected implying a contamination through the exposure of the water sample fiber input through laboratory air in 10 out of 24 samples 0 4 7 microplastic particles per m3 drinking water were found which the authors affiliated to the abrasion of pipes and fittings used in the drinking water system the particles found had sizes between 50 and 150 μm using μ ft ir spectroscopy particles can be detected down to a lower size limit of 20 μm due to the higher resolution of up to 1 μm μ raman spectroscopy is able to visualize very small microplastic particles that were most likely overlooked up to now ivleva et al 2017 especially for the analysis of food the detection of very small microplastic particles is important because of the possible implication on human health it is expected that smaller particles could possibly be better absorbed by the digestive system than larger ones hussain et al 2001 as a result an increased accumulation in humans could be the consequence 2 material and methods 2 1 materials particle counting and identification was done with the single particle explorer spe rapid berlin a μ raman spectroscope with a 10x 20x and 50x objective na 0 55 and a 532 nm 20 mw grating of 1040 lines mm and a 785 nm 50 mw grating of 1450 lines mm raman laser with adjustable laser power a maximum of 5000 particles scanning counts per measurement can be analyzed with the spe the smallest particle size that can be analyzed is 1 μm a specially manufactured filtering apparatus was needed for filtration filtr aid rapid berlin with a filter funnel that had a highly polished bottom ensuring tight closure with the filter membrane the inner diameter of the funnel was 4 mm top diameter 10 cm and the filtration volume was 100 ml since gold hardly emits any raman signals gold coated polycarbonate filter filtr aid membranes rapid berlin 3 0 μm pore size and inner diameter of 24 mm were used in order to obtain a smooth surface of the filter membrane a specific gold filter sample holder was supplied with the device this sample holder consisted of a base and a clamp in between the filter was clamped see supporting information s1 the gold filter sample holder was designed to fit exactly into the sample tray of the single particle explorer this guaranteed the center of the filter to be always in the middle and the filter membranes to stay plane these settings were essential for the subsequent automatic image analysis particle counting and raman analysis 2 2 types of water water samples volume range 700 ml 1500 ml from 12 different returnable and 10 single use plastic bottles 3 beverage cartons and 9 glass bottles were obtained from grocery stores in germany the water samples were classified into still mineral water medium sparkling and sparkling corresponding to its carbonic acid content four plastic bottled waters one single use and three returnable bottled waters of same brand manufacturer but with different batch numbers were purchased six weeks later to check the influence of production dates on microplastic content all analyses were performed in triplicate 2 3 procedures performed to prevent particle contamination 2 3 1 air borne and water borne contamination in order to avoid a particle contamination from indoor air all steps of the filtration process were conducted using a laminar flow workbench cleanroom class iso 3 envair eco air h envair deutschland gmbh emmendingen the bench was periodically checked for proper operation with a particulate measuring device trotec pc200 heinsberg germany in all filtration and handling steps a laboratory coat made of 100 cotton particle free nitrile gloves and arm sleeves were worn in the laboratory before every work step gloved hands were washed with detergent and thoroughly rinsed with milli q water in order to create a blank value with very low microplastic content different water sources were analyzed and a following cleaning process see 2 3 2 developed the overall lowest particle contamination was achieved using an ultra pure water system milli q advantage a10 merck millipore fed with deionized water as endfilter a 0 22 µm membrane filter for particulate free and bacteria free water millipak express 40 filter merck millipore was used before filtration each filter was analyzed with the μ raman spectroscope and tested for polymer particles present pre counted the number of plastic particles detected in this pre count was subtracted from the number of the detected polymer particles after filtration of the samples or the blanks in general these pre counted values were very small mostly between 0 and 4 highest value observed was 33 plastic particles 2 3 2 cleaning process a complex cleaning process was necessary to assure that the filtration setup and the glass vessels did not contribute to particle input even the smallest irregularities in the glass vessels could be a source of particle accumulation therefore all vessels were checked for any cracks or scratches in a first step glass funnel and vessels were intensively cleaned with deionized water detergent and cleanroom wipes then they were sonicated in milli q water for 30 min and subsequently extensively rinsed with milli q water all vessels were setup immediately on the clean bench in order to ensure that no new particles accumulated an imaging microscope at the clean bench was used for this pre check a picture of a clean gold filter flush filter was taken with the imaging microscope then about 50 ml milli q water were filter through this filter while washing over the surface area of the funnel after this step a new picture was taken if the before after filtration picture altered and new fibers or particles accumulated the rinsing steps were repeated the flush filter was wiped off carefully with a cleanroom wipe so it could be used a few times if finally the before after filtration picture does not alter anymore the funnel and used glass vessel were regarded as clean and the filtration of the sample was performed with a new pre counted filter a flowchart of the procedure is illustrated in supporting information s2 before filtration the outside of water bottles or beverage cartons was also cleaned in order to reduce the risk of contamination from the outside whenever possible the label was removed and the package was thoroughly rinsed with milli q water and placed on the clean bench immediately allowing to dry until filtration 2 4 filtration the entire water volume of every mineral water bottle or beverage carton was filtered through a pre counted filter under vacuum and then the container was rinsed with additional 50 ml of milli q water the funnel was then rinsed with 20 ml milli q water the vacuum was turned off and the funnel and the gold filter were taken off carefully to avoid scratches on the sensitive surface of the filter the gold coated polycarbonate filter was stored in a capped thin petri dish until analysis the petri dish used was the original packaging the gold coated polycarbonate filter was supplied shipped although these petri dishes were made out of polystyrol we could exclude contamination coming from these containers since no relevant amount of polystyrol particles were detected in our studies 2 5 counting and identification of microplastics with μ raman spectroscopy in order to best visualize captured particles on the gold coated polycarbonate filter the filters were first scanned completely in dark field mode with a 20 fold magnification the scanned area was chosen to be 4 4 mm 4 4 mm since this was the pre set instrumental setting closest to the dimension of the entire filtration area defined by dimension of 4 mm of the funnel used in dark field mode the background appeared black while particles were illuminated to optimize contrast between substrate and particle which ensured any white or transparent particles were not missed with the help of binarization the computer determines quantity size and morphology of the particles image analysis five size ranges to be measured were set as 5 10 μm 10 20 μm 20 50 μm 50 100 μm and 100 μm in a next step all recorded particles starting with a size of 5 μm were analyzed for their chemical composition the instrument settings were 532 nm excitation laser 5 s integration time laser intensity of 12 laser spot size was about 0 7 μm spectral resolution of 5 cm 1 and spectral range was set to 200 3200 cm 1 the spectrum of each particle was compared to a reference library rapid berlin for identification the library contained all common polymers and materials of other groups of substances like cellulose proteins or sugars the library was extended with additional spectra from materials such as the blue plastic caps from the water bottles or the blue nitrile gloves which were used in the lab library matches with a ranking greater than 700 were accepted in line with common practice in micro spectroscopy established by woodall woodall et al 2014 library matches with a ranking between 550 and 700 were analyzed and interpreted individually microplastic particles made up only a few percent min 0 03 max 10 7 of the total amount of counts per sample in some cases it was not possible to analyze all scanning counts with raman if the total scanning counts were higher than the 5000 maximum analyzable counts so the total microplastic counts had to be extrapolated the function select random particles of the instrument allowed the randomized analysis of a predefined number of particles whenever possible either all particles present or at least around 1000 particles of the smallest size range 5 10 μm were analyzed this was achieved using the select random particles function and then the overall microplastic count was extrapolated in this case a multiplying factor of 10 was the highest value that has never been exceeded the scanning counts in the other size ranges were all analyzed with raman for an example output list and calculation see supporting information s3 after the automated analysis was completed it was possible to manually select every counted particle in the verification mode with live view then the particles were analyzed again with longer integration time or a higher intensity at other spots to receive more significant spectra this verification mode has been used for all particles that ranked lower than 700 but higher than 550 because of this procedure it took up to 18 h for counting and analyzing just only one filter 2 6 statistical analysis statistically analysis was performed using microsoft excel 2010 and a statistical software statistica statsoft anova one way analysis of variance and tukey s hsd honestly significant difference post hoc test with p 0 05 were applied 3 results 3 1 blank samples analyzed polymer types and sizes correction for ambiguous particles as blank sample 1 l water from an ultra pure water system milli q advantage a10 merck millipore 0 45 μm endfilter millipak 40 fed with deionized water was filtrated in a sequence 10 in a row and also periodically between the measurements after every fifth sample to check for growing contamination trends within a total of 18 measurements 1 42 plastic particles have been found with a mean of 14 13 the predominant polymer types were pet but also pe ps and pp in their critical assessment of visual identification of marine microplastic using raman spectroscopy lenz et al already pointed out that colored particles or polymers are difficult to differentiate lenz et al 2015 in our samples we also found larger amounts of these particles and they had spectra similar to blue nitrile gloves followed in the ranking by heliogen blue and polypropylene blue bottle cap a differentiation is difficult since they all had very similar spectra see fig 1 we suspect that this was caused due to a colored polymer or another substance that contained blue pigments the blank controls did not show any of these particles but we found them in large amounts in every water from glass bottles rank 28 361 mean 115 102 particles l from one type of beverage carton 39 particles l as well as from one type of returnable bottle 27 particles l since blue nitrile gloves were worn during the experiments they could have contributed to the observed contamination however these particles should then have also been observed in every sample or blank since this was not the case and we were unable to identify the source of these colored particles they were not included in the microplastic particle count furthermore particles and films identified as white petroleum jelly and nylon were also excluded as they had always low rankings and similar spectra some examples of the library results are given in supporting information s4 in addition some of these particles or films disappeared after a longer or higher intensity laser treatment see fig 2 we suspect that the energy of the laser was too high and caused the particles to decompose since polymer gels are not classified as microplastics and additional verification was not possible the findings were also not included in the microplastic particle count the sum of white petroleum jelly and nylon particles remained 10 particles l in all four packaging types except for two samples of glass bottles 68 and 86 particles l and one sample of returnable bottles 21 particles calculated to the total microplastic amount of each packaging type this would have made up the following average percentages glass bottles 27 single use bottles 10 returnable bottles 3 beverage carton 18 besides these blue pigments white pigments identified as titanium dioxide were observed in a wide range of samples imhof et al 2016 reported high numbers of microplastic particles in a subalpine lake they were comprised of polymers with and without color pigments paint particles with a high pigment content as well as lower amounts of a polymeric binder the most common pigments found were pigment white 6 pigment blue 15 and pigment green 7 this correlates with the pigments found in this study however since we were unable to detect the underlying polymer type this probably resulted in an underestimation of microplastic particles present in the samples even though polyethylene terephthalate pet is a polyester pes there are different spectra available for pet and pes in the library used and the spectra differ only slightly when the pes particles were analyzed with a longer duration or higher laser intensity mostly a clear pet spectra became apparent since not every polyester particle was analyzed individually for a second time we summarized them as pest polyester polyethylene terephthalate table 1 summarizes the polymers detected and that were included in the microplastics particle count in the respective size ranges 5 10 μm 10 20 μm 20 50 μm 50 100 μm and 100 μm all particles identified consisting of polycarbonate nature were excluded form the particle count since the filter material was made of this polymer in general particles consisting of polycarbonate were rare 3 2 microplastics in water in total 38 mineral waters were analyzed for their microplastic content thereof 9 different brands of glass bottled waters 3 different brands of beverage cartons and 26 different brands of plastic bottles 11 single use and 15 returnable were analyzed we obtained a different batch of 4 plastic bottled waters at a later time one single use and three returnable bottled waters to determine whether the microplastics content varies between batches all results were normalized to 1 l sample volume for individual sample data see supporting information s5 3 2 1 plastic bottled waters water from the 11 single use bottles contained a mean of 14 14 particles l range 2 44 particles l see fig 3 the polymer identification revealed the following 59 of the particles consisted of pest 9 of pe 1 of pp and 1 of pa see fig 4 the remainder of 30 is attributed to other polymers predominantly showing one type of spectrum fig 5 red spectrum a database search suggested polysulfon or beta ionone and dimethoxybenzophenon however since polysulfone is a rare polymer and the rankings were not a perfect match and were only slightly above our acceptance score of 700 we suspect that the spectra could be derived from another substance not present in the database or derived from a mixture of polymers a statistical difference of the microplastic particles from water of single use bottles was only observed in the case of returnable bottles see fig 3 only 2 of the microplastic particles were of the biggest size 100 μm and 5 were in the size range of 50 100 μm see fig 6 22 were sized between 20 and 50 μm 30 between 10 and 20 μm and 41 between 5 and 10 μm the number of plastic particles in the water from 15 types of returnable plastic bottles resulted in a mean of 118 88 particles l range 28 241 particles l this was on average 8 times higher than the number of plastic particles found in water from single use plastic bottles as well as in the average blank the water from returnable plastic bottles had a 10 times higher number of plastic particles than the water from beverage cartons see fig 3 these findings were statistically significant identification of the composition of plastic particles found in water from returnable plastic bottles revealed that 84 consisted of pest 7 of pp 5 of pe and 2 of pa see fig 4 the rest of 2 consisted of other polymers the percentage polymer size distribution in returnable bottles were 100 μm 1 50 100 μm 2 20 50 μm 12 10 20 μm 29 and 5 10 μm 56 see fig 6 3 2 2 microplastics in glass bottles very different microplastic concentrations were found in the nine analyzed waters from glass bottles the number of particles varied between 4 and 156 particles l and the samples had an average of 50 52 particles l about 41 of the plastic consisted of pest 35 of pe and 8 of pp in comparison to the other packaging materials the particles found in water from glass bottles showed the highest concentration of pa 12 see fig 4 however the number of plastic particles found in water from glass bottles 50 52 were statistically not different compared to returnable bottles 118 88 single use bottles 14 14 beverage cartons 11 8 or the blank value 14 13 comparing the microplastic particle numbers with the five size ranges in glass bottles the following results were obtained 100 μm 3 50 100 μm 7 20 50 μm 14 10 20 μm 32 5 10 μm 45 see fig 6 3 2 3 microplastics in beverage cartons three different brands of water from beverage cartons were analyzed the water from beverage cartons showed the lowest microplastic counts of all examined packaging types we found between 5 and 20 particles l with an average of 11 8 particles l as mentioned before in section 3 1 one of the samples contained a comparatively high amount of particles classified as nitrile gloves blue 46 11 and 29 particles l which were not added to the total microplastic particle count aside from this the remaining plastic particles consisted of pe 38 pest 32 and pp 26 fig 4 in addition to microplastic particles many larger particles in the size range 50 100 μm and 100 μm largest particle was 1359 μm see supporting information s6 could be seen on the filter these larger particles were only detected in water from beverage cartons but not in water from plastic or glass bottles some of the larger particles were identified as cellulose fibers most likely derived from the carton itself a few other larger particles were identified as pe 7 of the microplastic particles were in the biggest size range of 100 μm whereas the biggest particle was 1349 μm the remaining size ranges had the following amounts 50 100 μm 10 20 50 μm 16 10 20 μm 28 5 10 μm 39 see fig 6 3 2 4 results from difference batches and influence of the carbon dioxide content different batches of a single use and three returnable bottled waters were analyzed some weeks later to check for influences of variations during manufacturing the single use bottled water o6 still o6 still 2 showed similar low microplastic contents even though the mean variation of the blank value was larger see fig 7 also the microplastic contents of the three returnable bottled waters r12 medium r12 classic and r4 classic were found to be within the same range the highest carbon dioxide content was present in classic water a lower content was present in medium water and almost none was present in still water types comparing the microplastic counts in water with different carbon dioxide contents a statistically significant difference between classic mean 99 82 particles l and still water mean 12 9 particles l was observed see fig 8 4 discussion in this study a total of 38 mineral waters of different types and with different type of packaging materials were analyzed for their microplastic content by means of μ raman spectroscopy 4 1 blank values as blank samples 1 l of milli q water was filtered in a sequence and also periodically between measurements to check for increasing or decreasing trend contamination the number of particles found in the blank samples were referred to as blank values in all of the 18 blank samples no trend in the contamination levels was observed despite our efforts to avoid particle contamination it was not possible to obtain a particle count blank value of zero in the blank samples by using another ultra filtration filter ultra filtration cartridge biopak c merk millipore we were able to further decrease the blank values in the present study however all data were generated using the blanks with the filters mentioned above see section 2 3 1 biopak c filter is the recommended filter for future studies 4 2 microplastic contents polymer types and size distribution a statistically significant difference between the number of microplastic particles in the blank values and water from returnable plastic bottles was observed the number of plastic particles in water from returnable bottles was 8 times higher than from water in single use plastic bottles and nearly 10 times higher than that from beverage cartons see fig 3 since the majority of microplastic particles in pet bottled mineral waters consist of polyester we conclude that microplastics were derived from the polymer bottle itself this is also supported by the fact that more pest particles have been found in water from returnable bottles these type of bottles are under more stress due to their reutilization than single use bottles or beverage cartons therefore microparticles can be a cause of increased abrasion from the packaging material a relation of carbon dioxide contents of the waters and number of microplastic particles was observed in this study still water had very a low amount of particles whereas sparkling water appeared to have high amount we suspect that the higher pressure in the bottles with sparkling water compared to the lower pressure of still water distributed in beverage cartons and bottles lead to increased stress on the plastic material resulting in the release of more particles the predominant amount of pe plastic particles in water from beverage cartons as well as the larger cellulose particles found on the filters were another indication that the contamination was derived from the packaging itself the beverage carton were coated with pe from the in and outside and also consisted of a layer of cellulosic material we didn t expect the larger amounts of microplastic found in water from glass bottles it is plausible that the hard glass material caused extra wear on the soft plastic material from the bottle cap and sealing and thus particles are released due to abrasion on average the microplastic content including the mean variation was higher in water from reusable glass and pet bottles than from disposable bottles cartons therefore we recommend to take a closer look at their production cleaning and refilling processes since this might reveal possible input sources of microplastic contamination further examination is required to confirm the source of these findings the analysis of different batches of the same water one single use bottle and three pairs of returnable bottles showed similar microplastic contents although the number of the repetition samples were small the similar plastic contents may indicate that the production date has no influence on the microplastic contents more data are needed to support this statement our study revealed that almost 80 of all microparticles were smaller than 20 μm therefore it is not surprising that previous studies did not find or only small amounts of microplastics in drinking water or beverages the main reason is attributed to the fact that these studies used μ ft ir not capable of detecting particle sizes smaller than 20 μm in addition we used an automated process of scanning and counting the gold filter in the dark field mode which ensured we did not miss the smallest particles which are often white or transparent these particles might not be visible when only the bright field mode or a white filter often used in spectroscopic methods is applied furthermore our method analyzed the entire filter area which reduced the probability of missing particles however this procedure is time and cost intensive for a higher sample throughput it is conceivable to analyze only a sector of the filter or a smaller number of particles if reproducibility is provided 4 3 limitations of the method and results we only had 3 water samples from beverage cartons because we were unable to obtain other samples from super markets in our area a larger number of samples for this packaging type would have led to more representative results we are also aware that there is a possibility that the larger cellulose particles could have overlaid some smaller particles which then could have not been analyzed an underestimation of small particles would have been the result another problem is that a maximum of 5000 particles in total could be identified with raman the highest total particle counts were obtained within the smallest size range 5 10 μm but not all particles could be analyzed by raman therefore the microplastic content had to be extrapolated based on the total particle counts regardless of a multiplying factor of a maximum of 10 an over or underestimation of plastic particles especially within this size range has to be taken into account the removal of ambiguous particle matches like blue nitrile gloves white petroleum jelly or nylon can be argued it is unclear what the origin substance of these particles is in general any occurring colored pigment fluorescence additive or carbon bond cause a problem because the underlying polymer spectra may be overlapped compare lenz et al 2015 therefore the removed ambiguous particles might indeed be of plastic nature and as a consequence the present microplastic particle numbers in this study might have been underestimated 5 conclusions we have successfully applied μ raman spectroscopy to detect and analyze very small microplastic particles 50 μm in mineral waters the high resolution of μ raman spectroscopy was necessary to detect the entire particle population mainly 80 consisting of particles with sizes smaller than 20 μm previous studies using μ ft ir spectroscopy have underestimated the microparticle numbers due to the inability of μ ft ir to detect sizes 20 μm water from reusable plastic bottles had the highest averaged polymer particle counts and the particles consisted primarily of polyester and polypropylene since the bottles are made of these materials it can be seen as an indication of a potential wear with the result of packaging material leaching into the water additional investigations should be conducted to further corroborate this theory abrasion or brittleness of the reusable bottles over time are concerning and could impact their reusability the fact that even with greatest care a zero blank value was not feasible demonstrates how ubiquitous microplastic particles are already distributed in the environment and that every processing and filtration step needs to be investigated for contamination sources sources of microplastics have been known for a while such as microplastic particle generation as a result of plastic littering or microbeads from cosmetic products however our results indicate that plastic packaging can also emit microparticles this is especially alarming since a wide range of food is packed or wrapped in plastic released microplastic particles could then be directly ingested by consumers further research and analysis is needed with a special focus on particles in the size range below 50 μm acknowledgements we thank the ministry for climate protection environment agriculture

19835,microplastics are anthropogenic contaminants which have been found in oceans lakes and rivers investigations focusing on drinking water are rare and studies have mainly been using micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy μ ft ir a major limitation of this technique is its inability to detect particles smaller than 20 μm however micro raman spectroscopy is capable of detecting even smaller particle sizes therefore we show that this technique which was used in this study is particularly useful in detecting microplastics in drinking water where particle sizes are in the low micrometer range in our study we compared the results from drinking water distributed in plastic bottles glass bottles and beverage cartons we tested the microplastic content of water from 22 different returnable and single use plastic bottles 3 beverage cartons and 9 glass bottles obtained from grocery stores in germany small 50 500 μm and very small 1 50 μm microplastic fragments were found in every type of water interestingly almost 80 of all microplastic particles found had a particle size between 5 and 20 μm and were therefore not detectable by the analytical techniques used in previous studies the average microplastics content was 118 88 particles l in returnable but only 14 14 particles l in single use plastic bottles the microplastics content in the beverage cartons was only 11 8 particles l contrary to our assumptions we found high amounts of plastic particles in some of the glass bottled waters range 0 253 particles l mean 50 52 particles l a statistically significant difference from the blank value 14 13 to the investigated packaging types could only be shown comparing to the returnable bottles p 0 05 most of the particles in water from returnable plastic bottles were identified as consisting of polyester primary polyethylene terephthalate pet 84 and polypropylene pp 7 this is not surprising since the bottles are made of pet and the caps are made of pp in water from single use plastic bottles only a few micro pet particles have been found in the water from beverage cartons and also from glass bottles microplastic particles other than pet were found for example polyethylene or polyolefins this can be explained by the fact that beverage cartons are coated with polyethylene foils and caps are treated with lubricants therefore these findings indicate that the packaging itself may release microparticles the main fraction of the microplastic particles identified are of very small size with dimensions less than 20 μm which is not detectable with the μ ft ir technique used in previous studies graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic mineral water micro raman spectroscopy beverages bottled water 1 introduction

in the study by wiesheu et al 2016 only one single pet fiber was found in one of the water samples but no statements about the total amount of other fibers or particles were made the study also didn t reveal anything about the type of water or the type of packaging the authors recommended further analysis of fiber content in different beverages and investigations of the sources of contamination pointing out the importance of working under extremely clean conditions in order to reduce contamination of the samples the helmholtz center for polar and marine research alfred wegener institute bremerhaven germany investigated a total of 40 000 l raw and tap water in lower saxony by means of μ ft ir mintenig et al 2014 in four blind samples fiber concentrations comparable to the other raw and drinking water samples were detected implying a contamination through the exposure of the water sample fiber input through laboratory air in 10 out of 24 samples 0 4 7 microplastic particles per m3 drinking water were found which the authors affiliated to the abrasion of pipes and fittings used in the drinking water system the particles found had sizes between 50 and 150 μm using μ ft ir spectroscopy particles can be detected down to a lower size limit of 20 μm due to the higher resolution of up to 1 μm μ raman spectroscopy is able to visualize very small microplastic particles that were most likely overlooked up to now ivleva et al 2017 especially for the analysis of food the detection of very small microplastic particles is important because of the possible implication on human health it is expected that smaller particles could possibly be better absorbed by the digestive system than larger ones hussain et al 2001 as a result an increased accumulation in humans could be the consequence 2 material and methods 2 1 materials particle counting and identification was done with the single particle explorer spe rapid berlin a μ raman spectroscope with a 10x 20x and 50x objective na 0 55 and a 532 nm 20 mw grating of 1040 lines mm and a 785 nm 50 mw grating of 1450 lines mm raman laser with adjustable laser power a maximum of 5000 particles scanning counts per measurement can be analyzed with the spe the smallest particle size that can be analyzed is 1 μm a specially manufactured filtering apparatus was needed for filtration filtr aid rapid berlin with a filter funnel that had a highly polished bottom ensuring tight closure with the filter membrane the inner diameter of the funnel was 4 mm top diameter 10 cm and the filtration volume was 100 ml since gold hardly emits any raman signals gold coated polycarbonate filter filtr aid membranes rapid berlin 3 0 μm pore size and inner diameter of 24 mm were used in order to obtain a smooth surface of the filter membrane a specific gold filter sample holder was supplied with the device this sample holder consisted of a base and a clamp in between the filter was clamped see supporting information s1 the gold filter sample holder was designed to fit exactly into the sample tray of the single particle explorer this guaranteed the center of the filter to be always in the middle and the filter membranes to stay plane these settings were essential for the subsequent automatic image analysis particle counting and raman analysis 2 2 types of water water samples volume range 700 ml 1500 ml from 12 different returnable and 10 single use plastic bottles 3 beverage cartons and 9 glass bottles were obtained from grocery stores in germany the water samples were classified into still mineral water medium sparkling and sparkling corresponding to its carbonic acid content four plastic bottled waters one single use and three returnable bottled waters of same brand manufacturer but with different batch numbers were purchased six weeks later to check the influence of production dates on microplastic content all analyses were performed in triplicate 2 3 procedures performed to prevent particle contamination 2 3 1 air borne and water borne contamination in order to avoid a particle contamination from indoor air all steps of the filtration process were conducted using a laminar flow workbench cleanroom class iso 3 envair eco air h envair deutschland gmbh emmendingen the bench was periodically checked for proper operation with a particulate measuring device trotec pc200 heinsberg germany in all filtration and handling steps a laboratory coat made of 100 cotton particle free nitrile gloves and arm sleeves were worn in the laboratory before every work step gloved hands were washed with detergent and thoroughly rinsed with milli q water in order to create a blank value with very low microplastic content different water sources were analyzed and a following cleaning process see 2 3 2 developed the overall lowest particle contamination was achieved using an ultra pure water system milli q advantage a10 merck millipore fed with deionized water as endfilter a 0 22 µm membrane filter for particulate free and bacteria free water millipak express 40 filter merck millipore was used before filtration each filter was analyzed with the μ raman spectroscope and tested for polymer particles present pre counted the number of plastic particles detected in this pre count was subtracted from the number of the detected polymer particles after filtration of the samples or the blanks in general these pre counted values were very small mostly between 0 and 4 highest value observed was 33 plastic particles 2 3 2 cleaning process a complex cleaning process was necessary to assure that the filtration setup and the glass vessels did not contribute to particle input even the smallest irregularities in the glass vessels could be a source of particle accumulation therefore all vessels were checked for any cracks or scratches in a first step glass funnel and vessels were intensively cleaned with deionized water detergent and cleanroom wipes then they were sonicated in milli q water for 30 min and subsequently extensively rinsed with milli q water all vessels were setup immediately on the clean bench in order to ensure that no new particles accumulated an imaging microscope at the clean bench was used for this pre check a picture of a clean gold filter flush filter was taken with the imaging microscope then about 50 ml milli q water were filter through this filter while washing over the surface area of the funnel after this step a new picture was taken if the before after filtration picture altered and new fibers or particles accumulated the rinsing steps were repeated the flush filter was wiped off carefully with a cleanroom wipe so it could be used a few times if finally the before after filtration picture does not alter anymore the funnel and used glass vessel were regarded as clean and the filtration of the sample was performed with a new pre counted filter a flowchart of the procedure is illustrated in supporting information s2 before filtration the outside of water bottles or beverage cartons was also cleaned in order to reduce the risk of contamination from the outside whenever possible the label was removed and the package was thoroughly rinsed with milli q water and placed on the clean bench immediately allowing to dry until filtration 2 4 filtration the entire water volume of every mineral water bottle or beverage carton was filtered through a pre counted filter under vacuum and then the container was rinsed with additional 50 ml of milli q water the funnel was then rinsed with 20 ml milli q water the vacuum was turned off and the funnel and the gold filter were taken off carefully to avoid scratches on the sensitive surface of the filter the gold coated polycarbonate filter was stored in a capped thin petri dish until analysis the petri dish used was the original packaging the gold coated polycarbonate filter was supplied shipped although these petri dishes were made out of polystyrol we could exclude contamination coming from these containers since no relevant amount of polystyrol particles were detected in our studies 2 5 counting and identification of microplastics with μ raman spectroscopy in order to best visualize captured particles on the gold coated polycarbonate filter the filters were first scanned completely in dark field mode with a 20 fold magnification the scanned area was chosen to be 4 4 mm 4 4 mm since this was the pre set instrumental setting closest to the dimension of the entire filtration area defined by dimension of 4 mm of the funnel used in dark field mode the background appeared black while particles were illuminated to optimize contrast between substrate and particle which ensured any white or transparent particles were not missed with the help of binarization the computer determines quantity size and morphology of the particles image analysis five size ranges to be measured were set as 5 10 μm 10 20 μm 20 50 μm 50 100 μm and 100 μm in a next step all recorded particles starting with a size of 5 μm were analyzed for their chemical composition the instrument settings were 532 nm excitation laser 5 s integration time laser intensity of 12 laser spot size was about 0 7 μm spectral resolution of 5 cm 1 and spectral range was set to 200 3200 cm 1 the spectrum of each particle was compared to a reference library rapid berlin for identification the library contained all common polymers and materials of other groups of substances like cellulose proteins or sugars the library was extended with additional spectra from materials such as the blue plastic caps from the water bottles or the blue nitrile gloves which were used in the lab library matches with a ranking greater than 700 were accepted in line with common practice in micro spectroscopy established by woodall woodall et al 2014 library matches with a ranking between 550 and 700 were analyzed and interpreted individually microplastic particles made up only a few percent min 0 03 max 10 7 of the total amount of counts per sample in some cases it was not possible to analyze all scanning counts with raman if the total scanning counts were higher than the 5000 maximum analyzable counts so the total microplastic counts had to be extrapolated the function select random particles of the instrument allowed the randomized analysis of a predefined number of particles whenever possible either all particles present or at least around 1000 particles of the smallest size range 5 10 μm were analyzed this was achieved using the select random particles function and then the overall microplastic count was extrapolated in this case a multiplying factor of 10 was the highest value that has never been exceeded the scanning counts in the other size ranges were all analyzed with raman for an example output list and calculation see supporting information s3 after the automated analysis was completed it was possible to manually select every counted particle in the verification mode with live view then the particles were analyzed again with longer integration time or a higher intensity at other spots to receive more significant spectra this verification mode has been used for all particles that ranked lower than 700 but higher than 550 because of this procedure it took up to 18 h for counting and analyzing just only one filter 2 6 statistical analysis statistically analysis was performed using microsoft excel 2010 and a statistical software statistica statsoft anova one way analysis of variance and tukey s hsd honestly significant difference post hoc test with p 0 05 were applied 3 results 3 1 blank samples analyzed polymer types and sizes correction for ambiguous particles as blank sample 1 l water from an ultra pure water system milli q advantage a10 merck millipore 0 45 μm endfilter millipak 40 fed with deionized water was filtrated in a sequence 10 in a row and also periodically between the measurements after every fifth sample to check for growing contamination trends within a total of 18 measurements 1 42 plastic particles have been found with a mean of 14 13 the predominant polymer types were pet but also pe ps and pp in their critical assessment of visual identification of marine microplastic using raman spectroscopy lenz et al already pointed out that colored particles or polymers are difficult to differentiate lenz et al 2015 in our samples we also found larger amounts of these particles and they had spectra similar to blue nitrile gloves followed in the ranking by heliogen blue and polypropylene blue bottle cap a differentiation is difficult since they all had very similar spectra see fig 1 we suspect that this was caused due to a colored polymer or another substance that contained blue pigments the blank controls did not show any of these particles but we found them in large amounts in every water from glass bottles rank 28 361 mean 115 102 particles l from one type of beverage carton 39 particles l as well as from one type of returnable bottle 27 particles l since blue nitrile gloves were worn during the experiments they could have contributed to the observed contamination however these particles should then have also been observed in every sample or blank since this was not the case and we were unable to identify the source of these colored particles they were not included in the microplastic particle count furthermore particles and films identified as white petroleum jelly and nylon were also excluded as they had always low rankings and similar spectra some examples of the library results are given in supporting information s4 in addition some of these particles or films disappeared after a longer or higher intensity laser treatment see fig 2 we suspect that the energy of the laser was too high and caused the particles to decompose since polymer gels are not classified as microplastics and additional verification was not possible the findings were also not included in the microplastic particle count the sum of white petroleum jelly and nylon particles remained 10 particles l in all four packaging types except for two samples of glass bottles 68 and 86 particles l and one sample of returnable bottles 21 particles calculated to the total microplastic amount of each packaging type this would have made up the following average percentages glass bottles 27 single use bottles 10 returnable bottles 3 beverage carton 18 besides these blue pigments white pigments identified as titanium dioxide were observed in a wide range of samples imhof et al 2016 reported high numbers of microplastic particles in a subalpine lake they were comprised of polymers with and without color pigments paint particles with a high pigment content as well as lower amounts of a polymeric binder the most common pigments found were pigment white 6 pigment blue 15 and pigment green 7 this correlates with the pigments found in this study however since we were unable to detect the underlying polymer type this probably resulted in an underestimation of microplastic particles present in the samples even though polyethylene terephthalate pet is a polyester pes there are different spectra available for pet and pes in the library used and the spectra differ only slightly when the pes particles were analyzed with a longer duration or higher laser intensity mostly a clear pet spectra became apparent since not every polyester particle was analyzed individually for a second time we summarized them as pest polyester polyethylene terephthalate table 1 summarizes the polymers detected and that were included in the microplastics particle count in the respective size ranges 5 10 μm 10 20 μm 20 50 μm 50 100 μm and 100 μm all particles identified consisting of polycarbonate nature were excluded form the particle count since the filter material was made of this polymer in general particles consisting of polycarbonate were rare 3 2 microplastics in water in total 38 mineral waters were analyzed for their microplastic content thereof 9 different brands of glass bottled waters 3 different brands of beverage cartons and 26 different brands of plastic bottles 11 single use and 15 returnable were analyzed we obtained a different batch of 4 plastic bottled waters at a later time one single use and three returnable bottled waters to determine whether the microplastics content varies between batches all results were normalized to 1 l sample volume for individual sample data see supporting information s5 3 2 1 plastic bottled waters water from the 11 single use bottles contained a mean of 14 14 particles l range 2 44 particles l see fig 3 the polymer identification revealed the following 59 of the particles consisted of pest 9 of pe 1 of pp and 1 of pa see fig 4 the remainder of 30 is attributed to other polymers predominantly showing one type of spectrum fig 5 red spectrum a database search suggested polysulfon or beta ionone and dimethoxybenzophenon however since polysulfone is a rare polymer and the rankings were not a perfect match and were only slightly above our acceptance score of 700 we suspect that the spectra could be derived from another substance not present in the database or derived from a mixture of polymers a statistical difference of the microplastic particles from water of single use bottles was only observed in the case of returnable bottles see fig 3 only 2 of the microplastic particles were of the biggest size 100 μm and 5 were in the size range of 50 100 μm see fig 6 22 were sized between 20 and 50 μm 30 between 10 and 20 μm and 41 between 5 and 10 μm the number of plastic particles in the water from 15 types of returnable plastic bottles resulted in a mean of 118 88 particles l range 28 241 particles l this was on average 8 times higher than the number of plastic particles found in water from single use plastic bottles as well as in the average blank the water from returnable plastic bottles had a 10 times higher number of plastic particles than the water from beverage cartons see fig 3 these findings were statistically significant identification of the composition of plastic particles found in water from returnable plastic bottles revealed that 84 consisted of pest 7 of pp 5 of pe and 2 of pa see fig 4 the rest of 2 consisted of other polymers the percentage polymer size distribution in returnable bottles were 100 μm 1 50 100 μm 2 20 50 μm 12 10 20 μm 29 and 5 10 μm 56 see fig 6 3 2 2 microplastics in glass bottles very different microplastic concentrations were found in the nine analyzed waters from glass bottles the number of particles varied between 4 and 156 particles l and the samples had an average of 50 52 particles l about 41 of the plastic consisted of pest 35 of pe and 8 of pp in comparison to the other packaging materials the particles found in water from glass bottles showed the highest concentration of pa 12 see fig 4 however the number of plastic particles found in water from glass bottles 50 52 were statistically not different compared to returnable bottles 118 88 single use bottles 14 14 beverage cartons 11 8 or the blank value 14 13 comparing the microplastic particle numbers with the five size ranges in glass bottles the following results were obtained 100 μm 3 50 100 μm 7 20 50 μm 14 10 20 μm 32 5 10 μm 45 see fig 6 3 2 3 microplastics in beverage cartons three different brands of water from beverage cartons were analyzed the water from beverage cartons showed the lowest microplastic counts of all examined packaging types we found between 5 and 20 particles l with an average of 11 8 particles l as mentioned before in section 3 1 one of the samples contained a comparatively high amount of particles classified as nitrile gloves blue 46 11 and 29 particles l which were not added to the total microplastic particle count aside from this the remaining plastic particles consisted of pe 38 pest 32 and pp 26 fig 4 in addition to microplastic particles many larger particles in the size range 50 100 μm and 100 μm largest particle was 1359 μm see supporting information s6 could be seen on the filter these larger particles were only detected in water from beverage cartons but not in water from plastic or glass bottles some of the larger particles were identified as cellulose fibers most likely derived from the carton itself a few other larger particles were identified as pe 7 of the microplastic particles were in the biggest size range of 100 μm whereas the biggest particle was 1349 μm the remaining size ranges had the following amounts 50 100 μm 10 20 50 μm 16 10 20 μm 28 5 10 μm 39 see fig 6 3 2 4 results from difference batches and influence of the carbon dioxide content different batches of a single use and three returnable bottled waters were analyzed some weeks later to check for influences of variations during manufacturing the single use bottled water o6 still o6 still 2 showed similar low microplastic contents even though the mean variation of the blank value was larger see fig 7 also the microplastic contents of the three returnable bottled waters r12 medium r12 classic and r4 classic were found to be within the same range the highest carbon dioxide content was present in classic water a lower content was present in medium water and almost none was present in still water types comparing the microplastic counts in water with different carbon dioxide contents a statistically significant difference between classic mean 99 82 particles l and still water mean 12 9 particles l was observed see fig 8 4 discussion in this study a total of 38 mineral waters of different types and with different type of packaging materials were analyzed for their microplastic content by means of μ raman spectroscopy 4 1 blank values as blank samples 1 l of milli q water was filtered in a sequence and also periodically between measurements to check for increasing or decreasing trend contamination the number of particles found in the blank samples were referred to as blank values in all of the 18 blank samples no trend in the contamination levels was observed despite our efforts to avoid particle contamination it was not possible to obtain a particle count blank value of zero in the blank samples by using another ultra filtration filter ultra filtration cartridge biopak c merk millipore we were able to further decrease the blank values in the present study however all data were generated using the blanks with the filters mentioned above see section 2 3 1 biopak c filter is the recommended filter for future studies 4 2 microplastic contents polymer types and size distribution a statistically significant difference between the number of microplastic particles in the blank values and water from returnable plastic bottles was observed the number of plastic particles in water from returnable bottles was 8 times higher than from water in single use plastic bottles and nearly 10 times higher than that from beverage cartons see fig 3 since the majority of microplastic particles in pet bottled mineral waters consist of polyester we conclude that microplastics were derived from the polymer bottle itself this is also supported by the fact that more pest particles have been found in water from returnable bottles these type of bottles are under more stress due to their reutilization than single use bottles or beverage cartons therefore microparticles can be a cause of increased abrasion from the packaging material a relation of carbon dioxide contents of the waters and number of microplastic particles was observed in this study still water had very a low amount of particles whereas sparkling water appeared to have high amount we suspect that the higher pressure in the bottles with sparkling water compared to the lower pressure of still water distributed in beverage cartons and bottles lead to increased stress on the plastic material resulting in the release of more particles the predominant amount of pe plastic particles in water from beverage cartons as well as the larger cellulose particles found on the filters were another indication that the contamination was derived from the packaging itself the beverage carton were coated with pe from the in and outside and also consisted of a layer of cellulosic material we didn t expect the larger amounts of microplastic found in water from glass bottles it is plausible that the hard glass material caused extra wear on the soft plastic material from the bottle cap and sealing and thus particles are released due to abrasion on average the microplastic content including the mean variation was higher in water from reusable glass and pet bottles than from disposable bottles cartons therefore we recommend to take a closer look at their production cleaning and refilling processes since this might reveal possible input sources of microplastic contamination further examination is required to confirm the source of these findings the analysis of different batches of the same water one single use bottle and three pairs of returnable bottles showed similar microplastic contents although the number of the repetition samples were small the similar plastic contents may indicate that the production date has no influence on the microplastic contents more data are needed to support this statement our study revealed that almost 80 of all microparticles were smaller than 20 μm therefore it is not surprising that previous studies did not find or only small amounts of microplastics in drinking water or beverages the main reason is attributed to the fact that these studies used μ ft ir not capable of detecting particle sizes smaller than 20 μm in addition we used an automated process of scanning and counting the gold filter in the dark field mode which ensured we did not miss the smallest particles which are often white or transparent these particles might not be visible when only the bright field mode or a white filter often used in spectroscopic methods is applied furthermore our method analyzed the entire filter area which reduced the probability of missing particles however this procedure is time and cost intensive for a higher sample throughput it is conceivable to analyze only a sector of the filter or a smaller number of particles if reproducibility is provided 4 3 limitations of the method and results we only had 3 water samples from beverage cartons because we were unable to obtain other samples from super markets in our area a larger number of samples for this packaging type would have led to more representative results we are also aware that there is a possibility that the larger cellulose particles could have overlaid some smaller particles which then could have not been analyzed an underestimation of small particles would have been the result another problem is that a maximum of 5000 particles in total could be identified with raman the highest total particle counts were obtained within the smallest size range 5 10 μm but not all particles could be analyzed by raman therefore the microplastic content had to be extrapolated based on the total particle counts regardless of a multiplying factor of a maximum of 10 an over or underestimation of plastic particles especially within this size range has to be taken into account the removal of ambiguous particle matches like blue nitrile gloves white petroleum jelly or nylon can be argued it is unclear what the origin substance of these particles is in general any occurring colored pigment fluorescence additive or carbon bond cause a problem because the underlying polymer spectra may be overlapped compare lenz et al 2015 therefore the removed ambiguous particles might indeed be of plastic nature and as a consequence the present microplastic particle numbers in this study might have been underestimated 5 conclusions we have successfully applied μ raman spectroscopy to detect and analyze very small microplastic particles 50 μm in mineral waters the high resolution of μ raman spectroscopy was necessary to detect the entire particle population mainly 80 consisting of particles with sizes smaller than 20 μm previous studies using μ ft ir spectroscopy have underestimated the microparticle numbers due to the inability of μ ft ir to detect sizes 20 μm water from reusable plastic bottles had the highest averaged polymer particle counts and the particles consisted primarily of polyester and polypropylene since the bottles are made of these materials it can be seen as an indication of a potential wear with the result of packaging material leaching into the water additional investigations should be conducted to further corroborate this theory abrasion or brittleness of the reusable bottles over time are concerning and could impact their reusability the fact that even with greatest care a zero blank value was not feasible demonstrates how ubiquitous microplastic particles are already distributed in the environment and that every processing and filtration step needs to be investigated for contamination sources sources of microplastics have been known for a while such as microplastic particle generation as a result of plastic littering or microbeads from cosmetic products however our results indicate that plastic packaging can also emit microparticles this is especially alarming since a wide range of food is packed or wrapped in plastic released microplastic particles could then be directly ingested by consumers further research and analysis is needed with a special focus on particles in the size range below 50 μm acknowledgements we thank the ministry for climate protection environment agriculture

19836,the intensive use of silver nanoparticles agnps in cosmetics and textiles causes their release into sewer networks of urban water systems although a few studies have investigated antimicrobial activities of nanoparticles against environmental bacteria little is known about potential impacts of the released agnps on sulfate reducing bacteria in sewers here we investigated the effect of agnps on desulfovibrio vulgaris hidenborough d vulgaris a typical sulfate reducing bacterium srb in sewer systems we found agnps stimulated the proliferation of d vulgaris rather than exerting inhibitory or biocidal effects based on flow cytometer detections both the cell growth rate and the viable cell ratio of d vulgaris increased during exposure to agnps at concentrations of up to 100 mg l the growth stimulation was dependent on the agnp concentration these results imply that the presence of agnps in sewage may affect srb abundance in sewer networks our findings also shed new lights on the interactions of nanoparticles and bacteria graphical abstract image 1 keywords silver nanoparticle sulfate reducing bacteria corrosion flow cytometer sewer networks 1 introduction due to their unique properties e g antimicrobial and electrical properties silver nanoparticles agnps are used in various products including cosmetics fabrics sensors paints and medical apparatus gottschalk et al 2009 kim et al 2010 palanisamy et al 2014 the total industrial production of agnps is estimated to be about 500 tons per year worldwide mueller and nowack 2008 ag is identified as the most common element in consumer nanotechnology products xiu et al 2012 the widespread use of agnps will inevitably accelerate the release of such materials into natural and engineered ecosystems which may pose adverse effects to public health and to environments based on a model prediction about 35 of agnps will enter sewers and eventually wastewater treatment plants wwtps sun et al 2015 the discharge of agnps from cosmetics and textiles which are the dominant applications for metallic agnps into the sewers and wwtps of an urban water system is inevitable for instance agnps in cosmetics are easily washed from the skin and agnps can leach out of clothing in a few washes benn and westerhoff 2008 kokura et al 2010 this potentially influences microbial communities in those engineered systems recently the potential impacts of agnps on microorganisms in the environment have attracted much concern previous studies have mainly focused on the toxicological and ecotoxicological impacts of agnps on some typical microbes in wwtps or soil systems e g escherichia coli nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria radzig et al 2013 ramalingam et al 2016 these studies showed that agnps have high antimicrobial efficacy against many bacteria species including e coil in natural ecosystems under high concentration exposure 10 mg l li et al 2010 they have also been found to influence removal efficiencies of organic matter nitrogen and phosphorous in wwtps due to their antimicrobial effects on various groups of microorganisms e g nitrosomonas europaea choi et al 2008 however the concentrations of agnps in wwtp effluent and sludge are estimated to be very low at 21 ng l gottschalk et al 2009 and 6 10 mg kg sun et al 2015 respectively and these levels may not significantly affect bacterial viability or growth further it is reported that ag2s is the dominant species detected in the wwtps and this has a lower toxicity compared to metallic pristine agnps siripattanakul ratpukdi and furhacker 2014 zhang et al 2016 previous studies investigated the impacts of agnps on microorganisms in wwtps levard et al 2012 and reported that nitrifying bacteria were especially susceptible to inhibition by agnps choi and hu 2008 however little is known about the potential impact of agnps to microbial communities in sewers considering anthropogenic discharge of agnps directly enter sewers it is relevant to investigate the effects of this antimicrobial agent in sewer networks which is a critical gap in our understanding of the impacts of nanoparticles on ecosystems in engineered urban water systems diverse microorganisms inhabit the sewers the status of microbial communities can directly affect sewer operation and maintenance in particular sulfate reducing bacteria srb are important members of the microbial communities in sewers which exert significant influence on sewer lifetime jiang et al 2009 concrete corrosion and the control of odour are serious and costly operational and maintenance problems in sewer systems jiang et al 2011 these problems are mainly caused by the generation of hydrogen sulfide h2s by srb the subsequent conversion of sulfide to sulfuric acid by aerobic sulfur oxidizing bacteria zhang et al 2008 causes corrosion of concrete and other sewer materials reducing the service life of sewer infrastructure the objective of this study is to reveal the potential effects of agnps on sewer microorganisms desulfovibrio vulgaris hidenborough d vulgaris a typical srb species in sewer systems gutierrez et al 2008 karkhoff schweizer et al 1995 was chosen as a model microbe the cell proliferation and viability of d vulgaris were estimated during exposure to agnps along with the transformation of carbon and sulfur compounds in response to different agnps exposure levels in addition transmission electron microscopy tem imaging energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx analysis and ionic silver sulfide and ag2s nps treatment experiments were also performed to reveal the interactions between agnps and d vulgaris 2 materials and methods 2 1 silver nanoparticles a silver nanoparticle solution 10 16 w w was purchased from fraunhofer institute for molecular

while control cultures received no agnps amendments agnps from the stock solution were added to the serum bottle cultures to achieve concentrations of 1 10 50 and 100 mg l these concentrations of agnps were chosen on the basis of preliminary studies data not shown representing the spectrum of cell growth responses to agnps following the agnps addition the cultures were cultivated for a further 24 h at 32 c with shaking during growth 3 ml samples were collected at eight different time points 2 or 4 h sampling intervals for determination of cell viability and membrane integrity samples 3 ml of the culture supernatants were drawn and used to determine the levels of sulfur species lactate and acetate the size and solubility of agnps were measured using a zetasizer nano zs malvern uk the hydrodynamic size of agnps in the growth medium was about 33 nm which is larger than that in water 10 nm fig s1 supporting information indicating agglomeration of nps in the medium the ions e g so4 2 po4 3 and cl strength in the medium might have increased the aggregate size of nps badawy et al 2010 the released ag was 1 04 mg l 2 h after agnps were dosed into an ls4d medium at 100 mg l and this value increased to 1 34 mg l 24 h after the dosing table s1 in order to study potential effects of ionic silver released from agnps d vulgaris was exposed to silver ions at concentrations equivalent to those released from agnps 1 04 1 34 and 2 0 mg ag l through the addition of agno3 in addition the impact of sulfide concentration on srb growth was also conducted by spiking na2s into the d vulgaris culture at three concentrations 50 200 and 450 mg s2 l ag2s nps treatment experiment were also conducted by spiking ag2s nps with concentrations of 1 10 and 50 mg l into the d vulgaris culture for silver ion sulfide and ag2s nps treatment experiments cell density and sulfate consumption were monitored to assess their effects on d vulgaris all experimental procedures of culture growth viability assays and chemical analyses were performed on triplicate cultures 2 4 cell growth and viability assays od600 was monitored during incubations using a cary 50 bio uv visible spectrophotometer varian australia cell viability and total cell counts of d vulgaris cultures that were non amended and amended with agnps were detected using live dead staining baclight bacterial viability kit l7012 following a previously reported protocol gao et al 2016 briefly cultured cells were stained anaerobically with 1 5 μl of syto 9 s9 and 1 5 μl of propidium iodide pi per 1000 μl

fluorescence from samples corresponding to syto 9 stained cells live cells was registered on the fl1 channel 530 nm and pi fluorescence damaged cells was obtained on the fl3 channel 610 nm to evaluate the bacterial physiological status the gates were established as viable cells in gate p1 and dead cells in gate p2 fig 1 however some of d vulgaris cells treated by agnps exhibited fluorescence in the p3 region which is located between p2 and p1 fig 1a this area was previously defined as damaged or injured cells combarros et al 2016 although it is yet uncharacterized in the present study the region of p3 was defined as intermediate cells to indicate cell status between live and dead the total cell numbers consist of cells located in regions p1 p2 and p3 the dots gated at p4 on the left bottom region of fig 1a belong to agnps or ag2s this was confirmed by staining cell free samples as the fluorescence signals in p4 increased with increasing dosage of agnps fig 1b d we observed that neither agnps fig 1b d or ag2s fig 1e nps has no significant impact on the flow cytometry detection when monitoring cell free controls containing agnps only it was observed that the fsc signal increased with agnps concentration which could be due to the agglomeration of nps in addition in the d vulgaris cultures amended with agnps an increase in intensity of ssc signal was observed and presumably this was due to light reflected from agnps internalized by the bacteria ghosh et al 2012 toduka et al 2012 2 6 chemical analyses the concentration of sulfur species sulfate sulfite thiosulfate and sulfide were detected using ion chromatography ic keller lehmann et al 2006 culture samples were immediately filtered through 0 22 μm filters merck millipore usa then 1 5 ml of the filtrate was transferred into 2

energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy tem edx tem was performed to reveal the interactions between agnps and d vulgaris cells suspension samples were collected at 4 h cultivation and then centrifuged

measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7700 aliquots of cultures amended with agnps were centrifuged at 20 000 g for 20 min supernatants were subsequently filtered by centrifugal filter 3 kda amicon germany which can capture agnps due to its filter size 0 3 nm an equal amount 1 ml of concentrated nitric acid was added to filtrates to acidify and digest metal cations so that total dissolved silver ions could be determined 2 9 statistical analysis all results are presented as means of replicate values standard deviation a one way analysis of variance anova was performed to test the effect of agnps exposures on the cell growth rates and viability 3 results 3 1 agnps exposure stimulated cell proliferation and viability of d vulgaris to determine the effects of agnps on d vulgaris we measured using flow cytometry the cell density and viability in the d vulgaris cultures without and with different levels of agnps amendments intriguingly the growth of d vulgaris was stimulated with increased agnps levels at 1 10 50 and 100 mg l fig 2 and fig s2 at early log phase prior to agnps addition the initial cell density was around 107 cells ml a concentration dependent stimulatory effect of the added agnps was observed on the cell growth after 8 h cultivation fig 2a the growth rate of d vulgaris in control cultures was 2 1 0 1 106 cell ml h whereas the growth rates of the treated cultures with 1 and 10 mg l agnps increased to 4 2 0 1 106 cell ml h and 6 1 0 1 106 cell ml h respectively surprisingly the cell growth rates further increased to 1 9 0 1 107 cell ml h and 2 6 0 2 107 cell ml h under exposure of 50 and 100 mg l agnps respectively after 8 h exposure the increased growth of d vulgaris was significant during exposure to agnps when compared to that of control cultures p 0 05 after 16 h exposure the cell proliferation rate in the cultures amended with 50 and 100 mg l agnps began to slow down and finally plateaued the stimulatory effect of agnps was further confirmed by live dead staining after 24 h exposure the live cell number of d vulgaris under exposure of 50 and 100 mg l agnps was significantly higher that of control cultures p 0 05 fig 2b the ratios of live d vulgaris cells relative to the total cell numbers were higher when exposed to agnps in comparison to controls in the absence of added agnps fig s2a correspondingly the ratios of dead d vulgaris cells at high concentrations of agnps exposure 50 and 100 mg l were significantly lower than that of the control cells p 0 05 fig s2b it was seen that the ratios of live and dead cells of control cultures did not change with cultivation time which remained at 60 7 and 22 3 respectively in contrast the proportions of live and dead cells changed with increasing exposure time to the agnps a substantial fraction of live cells 84 6 and 91 and a limited fraction of dead cells 11 6 and 6 1 were detected after incubation of d vulgaris with 50 and 100 mg l of agnps at 16 h exposure then after 24 h exposure the proportions of live cells amended with 50 and 100 mg l of agnps reduced to 63 0 and 70 6 respectively according to the dead cell proportions agnps did not exert any apparent biocidal effects on d vulgaris cells under the exposure conditions fig s2b however the ratio of intermediate cells was significantly lower in the presence of 50 and 100 mg l agnps compared to the control cells during the whole cultivation period p 0 05 fig s2c in addition to growth being stimulated in the presence of agnps the live dead staining implies that d vulgaris are able to tolerate agnps at concentrations of up to 100 mg l cell membrane integrity indicated by pi staining was not damaged by 24 h cultivation with these four levels of agnps from 1 to 100 mg l additionally the lower dead and intermediate cell ratios detected at high agnps exposures suggest that d vulgaris cells have an improved physiological status in the presence of the nps collectively the exposure of agnps stimulated cell proliferation of d vulgaris 3 2 metabolism of sulfate and lactate during agnps exposure d vulgaris uses sulfate as an electron acceptor for the anaerobic oxidation of lactate for energy generation these metabolic reactions of oxidation and terminal sulfate reduction occur in the cytoplasm vita et al 2015 to determine the effect of the nps on d vulgaris sulfate utilization various inorganic sulfur species including sulfate sulfite thiosulfate and sulfide were measured during exposure to different agnps concentrations fig 3 a d the consumption of sulfate was accompanied by sulfide production it was seen that the presence of agnps in the cultures did not incur stimulation on sulfate metabolism to the same extent as it did on cell proliferation in fact exposure of d vulgaris to agnps at concentrations of 1 10 and 100 mg l caused insignificant changes to the sulfate metabolisms in comparison to control cells without agnps treatment when the amount of sulfate reduced in the 24 h is compared p 0 05 in the case 50 mg l agnp after 24 h exposure the d vulgaris culture consumed 31 2 0 2 mm l sulfate only marginally exceeding the sulfate utilized by control cells 26 0 1 1 mm l p 0 02 sulfate reduction mediated by d vulgaris is described as a three step process firstly intracellular sulfate is activated to adenosine phosphosulfate aps then aps is reduced to sulfite and finally sulfite is reduced to sulfide gaucher et al 2008 zane et al 2010 it is still unknown whether the dissimilatory sulfite reduction involves the formation of thiosulfate as a necessary intermediate oliveira et al 2008 the accumulation of sulfite and thiosulfate were observed in all our cultures with or without agnps treatment fig 3c and d higher levels of sulfite and thiosulfate were generated in the control cells in comparison to treated cells suggesting that the agnps interfered somewhere in the sulfate metabolism pathway for instance after 20 h cultivation the sulfite accumulation was 0 66 mm l for the control cultures while lower sulfite levels 0 37 0 47 mm l standard deviation was 0 002 0 02 mm p 0 05 were detected for the cultures amended with 1 100 mg l agnps additionally 0 93 mm l thiosulfate was measured in the controls after 20 h cultivation whereas in all the cultures treated with nps the thiosulfate concentrations were all below 0 50 mm l p 0 05 fig 3d sulfur balance was performed based on measured sulfur species which shows a sulfur loss of 9 18 in the four cases table 1 the loss of sulfur could be due to the formation of unknown sulfur species such as elemental sulfur zhou et al 2007 polysulfides and polythionates celis garcía et al 2008 and the bisulfide and or a trisulfide cytoplasmic sulfite reductases complex zhou et al 2017 during sulfate reduction lactate is the carbon source and the electron donor linked to sulfate reduction vita et al 2015 compared to control cells without agnps exposure lactate consumption within 16 h cultivation was inhibited fig 3e in the cultures amended with 1 and 10 mg l agnps the lactate amounts utilized by d vulgaris were less than that of the control cells at 16 h cultivation in contrast cultures in the presence of 50 mg l agnps utilized more lactate compared to the control after 24 h incubation this coincided with the observed slight increase of sulfate utilization as more electrons generated from lactate would be available for sulfate reduction the lactate oxidation pathway in d vulgaris is through conversion of pyruvate to acetyl coa and then from acetyl coa to acetate via acetylphosphate noguera et al 1998 acetate concentrations in the cultures were measured fig 3f in the first 8 h cultivation acetate generation was inhibited in all cultures amended with agnps compared to that of control with the prolonged cultivation d vulgaris in the presence of agnps began to increase acetate production the amounts of sulfate reduced lactate oxidized and metabolites formed during 24 h cultivation in the presence and absence of agnps are calculated from fig 3 and shown in table 1 overall agnps exhibited stimulatory effect on anabolism of d vulgaris while did not significantly stimulate its catabolic processes 4 discussion 4 1 stimulatory effect of agnps on d vulgaris so far little is known about the potential impacts of agnps on srb in sewer systems to explore the potential effects of agnps on cell viability and metabolic properties of bacteria relevant to sewers we exposed d vulgaris a typical srb to agnps at 1 mg l and then to extreme industrial wastewater discharges 50 and 100 mg l this study revealed that agnps promote the anabolism of d vulgaris with enhanced cell growth and cell viability the stimulatory impacts observed on d vulgaris cells by agnps at elevated concentrations and the strong resilience of d vulgaris cells to agnps are different from the responses previously reported for other bacteria rai et al 2009 this is an important finding considering agnps are regarded to be a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent arnaout and gunsch 2012 in contrast to our findings previous studies arnaout and gunsch 2012 li et al 2010 radniecki et al 2011 reported the inhibitory or biocidal impacts of agnps on bacteria for instance agnps at 10 mg l completely inhibited the growth of e coli while agnps at 50 mg l inactivated respiratory chain dehydrogenases and damaged the structure of cell membranes li et al 2010 radniecki et al 2011 documented that small agnps exhibited more serious toxicity than larger ones when nitrosomonas europaea a typical ammonia oxidizing bacteria was exposed to agnps with size of 20 or 80 nm in addition to inhibitory impacts of agnps on bacterial growth some studies also reported adverse impacts on bacterial functions for example arnaout and gunsch 2012 documented that agnps at 2 mg l decreased the nitrification rate of n europaea by 91 4 0 2 this was thought to occur through dissolved silver disturbing the membrane structure and disrupting the function of membrane bound nitrifying enzymes in contrast some other studies reported that mixed cultures in wwtps were tolerant to agnps yang et al 2012 suggested that agnps at 40 mg l caused negligible inhibition to microorganisms in an anaerobic digester due to the absence of released silver ions chen et al 2012 also did not observe any significant effects of agnps at 5 mg l on phosphorus removal mediated by polyphosphate accumulating organisms it was suggested that microorganisms could be protected from agnps through the physical protection of extracellular polymeric substances eps chen et al 2012 in contrast to most of these findings and somewhat resembling our study xiu et al 2012 detected that nps incurred a stimulatory influence on e coli cell viability at sublethal agnps concentrations 1 8 16 4 mg l in addition to cell viability we measured the variations of cell proliferation cell membrane integrity and metabolic processes to obtain a better elucidation of the stimulatory effects of agnps in comparison to traditional approaches to measure cell growth such as optical density or drop plate methods combarros et al 2016 flow cytometry was used in this study flow cytometry is able to provide more accurate results for comparing cell proliferation and cell viability under different levels of agnps exposure in this study the traditional od600 was also performed to monitor cell growth however we found that the approach was not accurate in cultures exposed to agnps since the nps absorbance disturbed the optical density values data not shown previous studies have tried to overcome this problem by subtracting od values of cell free control samples containing nps only kuang et al 2013 however when applying nps to the bacterial suspension the particles would be associated with the bacteria and thus alter their dispersion and status as a consequence od600 is not an appropriate measurement to indicate cell density in these np studies the drop plate method is another widely used approach to monitor cell growth however this method will only detect culturable cells rather than the range of cell types that may exist in the culture giraffa 2004 thus we applied this flow cytometer approach as it provided a rapid and accurate method to quantify bacterial growth rates in cultures exposed to nps 4 2 stimulation mechanisms of agnps on srb to date little is known about the stimulatory impacts of agnps on bacterial growth and cell metabolism the inhibitory and biocidal mechanisms of nps have been suggested to be due to nanoparticles causing production of reactive oxygen species ros the release of toxic metals or by reacting directly with the biological membrane in particular the silver ions leaching from agnps has been proven to be a major antimicrobial substance choi and hu 2008 however silver ions unlikely impose an inhibitory effect on the d vulgaris cells in the presence of sulfide the solubility product constant of ag2s is 5 92 10 51 which means any silver leached from agnps will be immediately removed by sulfide forming ag2s our measurement indeed confirmed that silver ions in the agnps amended cultures were below the detection level of 0 001 mg l table s1 in comparison silver ions leaching from agnps was observed in milli q water and ls4d medium reaching concentrations of up to 1 34 mg l table s1 which suggests that the undetectable level of silver ions in the d vulgaris cultures amended with agnps was indeed most likely due to ag2s precipitation the absence of silver ions could partly explain why an inhibitory effect on d vulgaris cells was not observed in our experiments however it does not explain the stimulatory effects observed to further exclude potential contribution of silver ions d vulgaris was exposed to agno3 at ag concentrations 1 04 1 34 and 2 0 mg ag l corresponding to the silver ion concentrations released from agnps no stimulatory effect of ag on d vulgaris cell density or sulfur transformations was observed fig s3a and s4ac p 0 05 the formation of ag2s around d vulgaris cells could potentially alleviate the possible toxic inhibitory effect of sulfide on cells thus contributing to more favorable growth conditions for d vulgaris this could lead to a stimulatory effect when compared to control cells as observed in our experiments therefore sulfide treatment experiments were also carried out by spiking sulfide to achieve sulfide concentrations of 50 200 and 450 mg s2 l these concentrations are in the concentration range of sulfide produced in the control and agnps treated cultures there was no significant inhibition observed from the cell density and cell activity data i e sulfide production rate fig s3b and s4d p 0 05 collectively silver ion and sulfide did not incur significant inhibitory or stimulatory effect on the growth of srb suggesting a possibility that the silver nanoparticles themselves may have directly induced the stimulatory effects tem images of control and agnps 50 and 100 mg l treated cultures fig s5 revealed that some agnps were surrounding or attached to d vulgaris cells however the morphology and membrane structure of the treated cells were almost as intact as that of non treated cells suggesting that agnps did not damage d vulgaris cells edx analysis was preformed to describe the silver speciation in cultures after agnps addition the speciation of silver surrounding bacterial cells was also analyzed using edx fig s6 and both the characteristic ag peak and s peak was observed it was observed that both ag and s were mainly distributed outside the cells and some ag elements were overlapped with s thus it is assumed that the particle clusters around bacteria could be a mix of compounds or elements e g agnps ag2s nps and element s in order to investigate the potential impact of ag2s nps on the d vulgaris ag2s nps were dosed into the culture as shown in fig s3c s4e and s4f ag2s did not exert significant effect on the growth and sulfur metabolism of d vulgaris p 0 05 in another study of np toxicity viable cell proportions of e coli were seen to increase by 6 21 when exposed to agnps at 1 8 16 4 mg l table s2 xiu et al 2012 they suggested that agnps triggered repair mechanisms of the cells which overcompensated for the toxicity of the nps kawata et al 2009 also documented that addition of 0 1 0 5 mg l of agnps significantly increased the growth of hepg2 cells table s2 which could be described as an adaptive response to an initial disturbance in homeostasis kawata et al 2009 additionally it has been revealed that an adapted alteration in a histidine kinase protein gene lyts contributes to growth rate increase when the responses of d vulgaris to salt stress were investigated zhou et al 2015 these previous studies reported the stimulatory mechanism may attribute to the repair mechanisms of cells xiu et al 2012 the adaptive responses of cells kawata et al 2009 plasmon resonance wang et al 2013 and the adapted alteration in genes zhou et al 2015 until now the mechanism of hormetic response caused by agnps is still unknown which requires further studies the addition of agnps enhanced the anabolism of d vulgaris while its catabolic activities were not enhanced to the same degree in order to reveal the connections between cell density and the lactate sulfate metabolism we calculated the per cell substrate metabolic rates for the control and treated cultures after 24 h cultivation table 2 the results indicate that with the increase of cell density under agnps addition the specific lactate sulfate uptake rate and acetate sulfide production rate decreased in treated cultures it seems that the cell specific metabolic rate changed in cultures under agnps exposure which means the d vulgaris cells consumed less energy but generated more cells the growth yields of d vulgaris reported in previous studies also indicated that the growth yields could vary from different culture conditions badziong and thauer 1978 nethe jaenchen and thauer 1984 it is assumed that the presence of agnps might cause decoupling between anabolic and catabolic processes which warrants further investigations based on transcriptomics or proteomics it is noteworthy that less accumulation of sulfite and thiosulfate were observed in the cultures amended with agnps fig 3c and d which implies the presence of agnps facilitated the transformations from sulfite to thiosulfate then to sulfide since sulfate reduction takes place in the cytoplasm and electron storage may occur in the periplasm electrons will transverse the cytoplasmic membrane this process would involve several trans membrane complexes e g cytochrome c complex hmc type ii cytochrome c 3 complex tmc and the quinone interacting membrane bound oxidoreductase complex qmo in d vulgaris these complexes are proposed to partake in the sulfate reduction pathway zane et al 2010 however at present there are limited studies that investigate the effects of agnps exposure to cell metabolism 4 3 implications this study reports that agnps distinctly simulated the cell growth of d vulgaris under very high agnps dosages 50 or 100 mg l this unexpected finding changed our previous assumption that agnps usually exhibit inhibitory or biocidal impacts on environmental microorganisms discharged agnps will firstly be released into sewers and there the particles can potentially affect the growth of srb hydrogen sulfide produced by srb in sewers causes serious asset deterioration due to sulfide induced concrete corrosion sewer systems suffering from corrosion require significant capital investment for premature replacement or extensive sewer rehabilitation moreover odour resulting from h2s should be managed to meet the public demands for an odour free environment the practical control strategies for corrosion and odour problems essentially involves the inhibition of srb activity or removal of hydrogen sulfide by dosing some chemicals such as nitrate iron salts and free nitrous acid jiang et al 2011 this study suggested that no any significant stimulation or inhibition was found under agnps at environmentally relevant concentration e g 0 1 or 1 mg l implying there might not be necessary to worry about the negative effects of agnps on sewer management however most agnps are coming from pharmaceuticals and cleaning product use that will be more concentrated in this segregated wastewater an extremely high concentration or shock loading of agnps could be available in these particular sewer sections serving industrial areas thus probably posing risks to microbial communities if directly discharging concentrated wastewater into sewer systems further in situ studies are required to reveal the interactions between the agnps and the srb in sewer biofilms and sediments 5 conclusions exposures of cultured d vulgaris to agnps 1 100 mg l stimulated cell proliferation and cell viability while its catabolic activities were not enhanced to the same degree this is in contrast to the expected inhibitory and biocidal effects of agnps the observation that d vulgaris could be tolerant to up to 100 mg l agnps implies that bacteria like d vulgaris have the potential to stay viable under this high stress this stimulatory impact on cell growth of d vulgaris could potentially cause negative effects on sewer corrosion and odour management the mechanisms involved in the stimulation of cell proliferation and cell viability by agnps are still unclear transcript expression studies based on genome wide rna sequencing could be useful to identify the molecular mechanisms involved in the resistance of d vulgaris to agnps and their stimulatory effects acknowledgements we acknowledge the australian research council for funding support through the

19836,the intensive use of silver nanoparticles agnps in cosmetics and textiles causes their release into sewer networks of urban water systems although a few studies have investigated antimicrobial activities of nanoparticles against environmental bacteria little is known about potential impacts of the released agnps on sulfate reducing bacteria in sewers here we investigated the effect of agnps on desulfovibrio vulgaris hidenborough d vulgaris a typical sulfate reducing bacterium srb in sewer systems we found agnps stimulated the proliferation of d vulgaris rather than exerting inhibitory or biocidal effects based on flow cytometer detections both the cell growth rate and the viable cell ratio of d vulgaris increased during exposure to agnps at concentrations of up to 100 mg l the growth stimulation was dependent on the agnp concentration these results imply that the presence of agnps in sewage may affect srb abundance in sewer networks our findings also shed new lights on the interactions of nanoparticles and bacteria graphical abstract image 1 keywords silver nanoparticle sulfate reducing bacteria corrosion flow cytometer sewer networks 1 introduction due to their unique properties e g antimicrobial and electrical properties silver nanoparticles agnps are used in various products including cosmetics fabrics sensors paints and medical apparatus gottschalk et al 2009 kim et al 2010 palanisamy et al 2014 the total industrial production of agnps is estimated to be about 500 tons per year worldwide mueller and nowack 2008 ag is identified as the most common element in consumer nanotechnology products xiu et al 2012 the widespread use of agnps will inevitably accelerate the release of such materials into natural and engineered ecosystems which may pose adverse effects to public health and to environments based on a model prediction about 35 of agnps will enter sewers and eventually wastewater treatment plants wwtps sun et al 2015 the discharge of agnps from cosmetics and textiles which are the dominant applications for metallic agnps into the sewers and wwtps of an urban water system is inevitable for instance agnps in cosmetics are easily washed from the skin and agnps can leach out of clothing in a few washes benn and westerhoff 2008 kokura et al 2010 this potentially influences microbial communities in those engineered systems recently the potential impacts of agnps on microorganisms in the environment have attracted much concern previous studies have mainly focused on the toxicological and ecotoxicological impacts of agnps on some typical microbes in wwtps or soil systems e g escherichia coli nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria radzig et al 2013 ramalingam et al 2016 these studies showed that agnps have high antimicrobial efficacy against many bacteria species including e coil in natural ecosystems under high concentration exposure 10 mg l li et al 2010 they have also been found to influence removal efficiencies of organic matter nitrogen and phosphorous in wwtps due to their antimicrobial effects on various groups of microorganisms e g nitrosomonas europaea choi et al 2008 however the concentrations of agnps in wwtp effluent and sludge are estimated to be very low at 21 ng l gottschalk et al 2009 and 6 10 mg kg sun et al 2015 respectively and these levels may not significantly affect bacterial viability or growth further it is reported that ag2s is the dominant species detected in the wwtps and this has a lower toxicity compared to metallic pristine agnps siripattanakul ratpukdi and furhacker 2014 zhang et al 2016 previous studies investigated the impacts of agnps on microorganisms in wwtps levard et al 2012 and reported that nitrifying bacteria were especially susceptible to inhibition by agnps choi and hu 2008 however little is known about the potential impact of agnps to microbial communities in sewers considering anthropogenic discharge of agnps directly enter sewers it is relevant to investigate the effects of this antimicrobial agent in sewer networks which is a critical gap in our understanding of the impacts of nanoparticles on ecosystems in engineered urban water systems diverse microorganisms inhabit the sewers the status of microbial communities can directly affect sewer operation and maintenance in particular sulfate reducing bacteria srb are important members of the microbial communities in sewers which exert significant influence on sewer lifetime jiang et al 2009 concrete corrosion and the control of odour are serious and costly operational and maintenance problems in sewer systems jiang et al 2011 these problems are mainly caused by the generation of hydrogen sulfide h2s by srb the subsequent conversion of sulfide to sulfuric acid by aerobic sulfur oxidizing bacteria zhang et al 2008 causes corrosion of concrete and other sewer materials reducing the service life of sewer infrastructure the objective of this study is to reveal the potential effects of agnps on sewer microorganisms desulfovibrio vulgaris hidenborough d vulgaris a typical srb species in sewer systems gutierrez et al 2008 karkhoff schweizer et al 1995 was chosen as a model microbe the cell proliferation and viability of d vulgaris were estimated during exposure to agnps along with the transformation of carbon and sulfur compounds in response to different agnps exposure levels in addition transmission electron microscopy tem imaging energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx analysis and ionic silver sulfide and ag2s nps treatment experiments were also performed to reveal the interactions between agnps and d vulgaris 2 materials and methods 2 1 silver nanoparticles a silver nanoparticle solution 10 16 w w was purchased from fraunhofer institute for molecular

obtain cells in the early log phase as indicated by an od600 of about 0 2 2 3 exposure experiment of d vulgaris to agnps early log phase d vulgaris cultures were treated with different levels of agnps while control cultures received no agnps amendments agnps from the stock solution were added to the serum bottle cultures to achieve concentrations of 1 10 50 and 100 mg l these concentrations of agnps were chosen on the basis of preliminary studies data not shown representing the spectrum of cell growth responses to agnps following the agnps addition the cultures were cultivated for a further 24 h at 32 c with shaking during growth 3 ml samples were collected at eight different time points 2 or 4 h sampling intervals for determination of cell viability and membrane integrity samples 3 ml of the culture supernatants were drawn and used to determine the levels of sulfur species lactate and acetate the size and solubility of agnps were measured using a zetasizer nano zs malvern uk the hydrodynamic size of agnps in the growth medium was about 33 nm which is larger than that in water 10 nm fig s1 supporting information indicating agglomeration of nps in the medium the ions e g so4 2 po4 3 and cl strength in the medium might have increased the aggregate size of nps badawy et al 2010 the released ag was 1 04 mg l 2 h after agnps were dosed into an ls4d medium at 100 mg l and this value increased to 1 34 mg l 24 h after the dosing table s1 in order to study potential effects of ionic silver released from agnps d vulgaris was exposed to silver ions at concentrations equivalent

spectrophotometer varian australia cell viability and total cell counts of d vulgaris cultures that were non amended and amended with agnps were detected using live dead staining baclight bacterial

fluorescence from samples corresponding to syto 9 stained cells live cells was registered on the fl1 channel 530 nm and pi fluorescence damaged cells was obtained on the fl3 channel 610 nm to evaluate the bacterial physiological status the gates were established as viable cells in gate p1 and dead cells in gate p2 fig 1 however some of d vulgaris cells treated by agnps exhibited fluorescence in the p3 region which is located between p2 and p1 fig 1a this area was previously defined as damaged or injured cells combarros et al 2016 although it is yet uncharacterized in the present study the region of p3 was defined as intermediate cells to indicate cell status between live and dead the total cell numbers consist of cells located in regions p1 p2 and p3 the dots gated at p4 on the left bottom region of fig 1a belong to agnps or ag2s this was confirmed by staining cell free samples as the fluorescence signals in p4 increased with increasing dosage of agnps fig 1b d we observed that neither agnps fig 1b d or ag2s fig 1e nps has no significant impact on the flow cytometry detection when monitoring cell free controls containing agnps only it was observed that the fsc signal increased with agnps concentration which could be due to the agglomeration of nps in addition in the d vulgaris cultures amended with agnps an increase in intensity of ssc signal was observed and presumably this was due to light reflected from agnps internalized by the bacteria ghosh et al 2012 toduka et al 2012 2 6 chemical analyses the concentration of sulfur species sulfate sulfite thiosulfate and sulfide were detected using ion chromatography ic keller lehmann et al 2006 culture samples were immediately filtered through 0 22 μm filters merck millipore usa then 1 5 ml of the filtrate was transferred into 2

was performed to test the effect of agnps exposures on the cell growth rates and viability 3 results 3 1 agnps exposure stimulated cell proliferation and viability of d vulgaris to determine the effects of agnps on d vulgaris we measured using flow cytometry the cell density and viability in the d vulgaris cultures without and with different levels of agnps amendments intriguingly the growth of d vulgaris was stimulated with increased agnps levels at 1 10 50 and 100 mg l fig 2 and fig s2 at early log phase prior to agnps addition the initial cell density was around 107 cells ml a concentration dependent stimulatory effect of the added agnps was observed on the cell growth after 8 h cultivation fig 2a the growth rate of d vulgaris in control cultures was 2 1 0 1 106 cell ml h whereas the growth rates of the treated cultures with 1 and 10 mg l agnps increased to 4 2 0 1 106 cell ml h and 6 1 0 1 106 cell ml h respectively surprisingly the cell growth rates further increased to 1 9 0 1 107 cell ml h and 2 6 0 2 107 cell ml h under exposure of 50 and 100 mg l agnps respectively after 8 h exposure the increased growth of d vulgaris was significant during exposure to agnps when compared to that of control cultures p 0 05 after 16 h exposure the cell proliferation rate in the cultures amended with 50 and 100 mg l agnps began to slow down and finally plateaued the stimulatory effect of agnps was further confirmed by live dead staining after 24 h exposure the live cell number of d vulgaris under exposure of 50 and 100 mg l agnps was significantly higher that of control cultures p 0 05 fig 2b the ratios of live d vulgaris cells relative to the total cell numbers were higher when exposed to agnps in comparison to controls in the absence of added agnps fig s2a correspondingly the ratios of dead d vulgaris cells at high concentrations of agnps exposure 50 and 100 mg l were significantly lower than that of the control cells p 0 05 fig s2b it was seen that the ratios of live and dead cells of control cultures did not change with cultivation time which remained at 60 7 and 22 3 respectively in contrast the proportions of live and dead cells changed with increasing exposure time to the agnps a substantial fraction of live cells 84 6 and 91 and a limited fraction of dead cells 11 6 and 6 1 were detected after incubation of d vulgaris with 50 and 100 mg l of agnps at 16 h exposure then after 24 h exposure the proportions of live cells amended with 50 and 100 mg l of agnps reduced to 63 0 and 70 6 respectively according to the dead cell proportions agnps did not exert any apparent biocidal effects on d vulgaris cells under the exposure conditions fig s2b however the ratio of intermediate cells was significantly lower in the presence of 50 and 100 mg l agnps compared to the control cells during the whole cultivation period p 0 05 fig s2c in addition to growth being stimulated in the presence of agnps the live dead staining implies that d vulgaris are able to tolerate agnps at concentrations of up to 100 mg l cell membrane integrity indicated by pi staining was not damaged by 24 h cultivation with these four levels of agnps from 1 to 100 mg l additionally the lower dead and intermediate cell ratios detected at high agnps exposures suggest that d vulgaris cells have an improved physiological status in the presence of the nps collectively the exposure of agnps stimulated cell proliferation of d vulgaris 3 2 metabolism of sulfate and lactate during agnps exposure d vulgaris uses sulfate as an electron acceptor for the anaerobic oxidation of lactate for energy generation these metabolic reactions of oxidation and terminal sulfate reduction occur in the cytoplasm vita et al 2015 to determine the effect of the nps on d vulgaris sulfate utilization various inorganic sulfur species including sulfate sulfite thiosulfate and sulfide were measured during exposure to different agnps concentrations fig 3 a d the consumption of sulfate was accompanied by sulfide production it was seen that the presence of agnps in the cultures did not incur stimulation on sulfate metabolism to the same extent as it did on cell proliferation in fact exposure of d vulgaris to agnps at concentrations of 1 10 and 100 mg l caused insignificant changes to the sulfate metabolisms in comparison to control cells without agnps treatment when the amount of sulfate reduced in the 24 h is compared p 0 05 in the case 50 mg l agnp after 24 h exposure the d vulgaris culture consumed 31 2 0 2 mm l sulfate only marginally exceeding the sulfate utilized by control cells 26 0 1 1 mm l p 0 02 sulfate reduction mediated by d vulgaris is described as a three step process firstly intracellular sulfate is activated to adenosine phosphosulfate aps then aps is reduced to sulfite and finally sulfite is reduced to sulfide gaucher et al 2008 zane et al 2010 it is still unknown whether the dissimilatory sulfite reduction involves the formation of thiosulfate as a necessary intermediate oliveira et al 2008 the accumulation of sulfite and thiosulfate were observed in all our cultures with or without agnps treatment fig 3c and d higher levels of sulfite and thiosulfate were generated in the control cells in comparison to treated cells suggesting that the agnps interfered somewhere in the sulfate metabolism pathway for instance after 20 h cultivation the sulfite accumulation was 0 66 mm l for the control cultures while lower sulfite levels 0 37 0 47 mm l standard deviation was 0 002 0 02 mm p 0 05 were detected for the cultures amended with 1 100 mg l agnps additionally 0 93 mm l thiosulfate was measured in the controls after 20 h cultivation whereas in all the cultures treated with nps the thiosulfate concentrations were all below 0 50 mm l p 0 05 fig 3d sulfur balance was performed based on measured sulfur species which shows a sulfur loss of 9 18 in the four cases table 1 the loss of sulfur could be due to the formation of unknown sulfur species such as elemental sulfur zhou et al 2007 polysulfides and polythionates celis garcía et al 2008 and the bisulfide and or a trisulfide cytoplasmic sulfite reductases complex zhou et al 2017 during sulfate reduction lactate is the carbon source and the electron donor linked to sulfate reduction vita et al 2015 compared to control cells without agnps exposure lactate consumption within 16 h cultivation was inhibited fig 3e in the cultures amended with 1 and 10 mg l agnps the lactate amounts utilized by d vulgaris were less than that of the control cells at 16 h cultivation in contrast cultures in the presence of 50 mg l agnps utilized more lactate compared to the control after 24 h incubation this coincided with the observed slight increase of sulfate utilization as more electrons generated from lactate would be available for sulfate reduction the lactate oxidation pathway in d vulgaris is through conversion of pyruvate to acetyl coa and then from acetyl coa to acetate via acetylphosphate noguera et al 1998 acetate concentrations in the cultures were measured fig 3f in the first 8 h cultivation acetate generation was inhibited in all cultures amended with agnps compared to that of control with the prolonged cultivation d vulgaris in the presence of agnps began to increase acetate production the amounts of sulfate reduced lactate oxidized and metabolites formed during 24 h cultivation in the presence and absence of agnps are calculated from fig 3 and shown in table 1 overall agnps exhibited stimulatory effect on anabolism of d vulgaris while did not significantly stimulate its catabolic processes 4 discussion 4 1 stimulatory effect of agnps on d vulgaris so far little is known about the potential impacts of agnps on srb in sewer systems to explore the potential effects of agnps on cell viability and metabolic properties of bacteria relevant to sewers we exposed d vulgaris a typical srb to agnps at 1 mg l and then to extreme industrial wastewater discharges 50 and 100 mg l this study revealed that agnps promote the anabolism of d vulgaris with enhanced cell growth and cell viability the stimulatory impacts observed on d vulgaris cells by agnps at elevated concentrations and the strong resilience of d vulgaris cells to agnps are different from the responses previously reported for other bacteria rai et al 2009 this is an important finding considering agnps are regarded to be a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent arnaout and gunsch 2012 in contrast to our findings previous studies arnaout and gunsch 2012 li et al 2010 radniecki et al 2011 reported the inhibitory or biocidal impacts of agnps on bacteria for instance agnps at 10 mg l completely inhibited the growth of e coli while agnps at 50 mg l inactivated respiratory chain dehydrogenases and damaged the structure of cell membranes li et al 2010 radniecki et al 2011 documented that small agnps exhibited more serious toxicity than larger ones when nitrosomonas europaea a typical ammonia oxidizing bacteria was exposed to agnps with size of 20 or 80 nm in addition to inhibitory impacts of agnps on bacterial growth some studies also reported adverse impacts on bacterial functions for example arnaout and gunsch 2012 documented that agnps at 2 mg l decreased the nitrification rate of n europaea by 91 4 0 2 this was thought to occur through dissolved silver disturbing the membrane structure and disrupting the function of membrane bound nitrifying enzymes in contrast some other studies reported that mixed cultures in wwtps were tolerant to agnps yang et al 2012 suggested that agnps at 40 mg l caused negligible inhibition to microorganisms in an anaerobic digester due to the absence of released silver ions chen et al 2012 also did not observe any significant effects of agnps at 5 mg l on phosphorus removal mediated by polyphosphate accumulating organisms it was suggested that microorganisms could be protected from agnps through the physical protection of extracellular polymeric substances eps chen et al 2012 in contrast to most of these findings and somewhat resembling our study xiu et al 2012 detected that nps incurred a stimulatory influence on e coli cell viability at sublethal agnps concentrations 1 8 16 4 mg l in addition to cell viability we measured the variations of cell proliferation cell membrane integrity and metabolic processes to obtain a better elucidation of the stimulatory effects of agnps in comparison to traditional approaches to measure cell growth such as optical density or drop plate methods combarros et al 2016 flow cytometry was used in this study flow cytometry is able to provide more accurate results for comparing cell proliferation and cell viability under different levels of agnps exposure in this study the traditional od600 was also performed to monitor cell growth however we found that the approach was not accurate in cultures exposed to agnps since the nps absorbance disturbed the optical density values data not shown previous studies have tried to overcome this problem by subtracting od values of cell free control samples containing nps only kuang et al 2013 however when applying nps to the bacterial suspension the particles would be associated with the bacteria and thus alter their dispersion and status as a consequence od600 is not an appropriate measurement to indicate cell density in these np studies the drop plate method is another widely used approach to monitor cell growth however this method will only detect culturable cells rather than the range of cell types that may exist in the culture giraffa 2004 thus we applied this flow cytometer approach as it provided a rapid and accurate method to quantify bacterial growth rates in cultures exposed to nps 4 2 stimulation mechanisms of agnps on srb to date little is known about the stimulatory impacts of agnps on bacterial growth and cell metabolism the inhibitory and biocidal mechanisms of nps have been suggested to be due to nanoparticles causing production of reactive oxygen species ros the release of toxic metals or by reacting directly with the biological membrane in particular the silver ions leaching from agnps has been proven to be a major antimicrobial substance choi and hu 2008 however silver ions unlikely impose an inhibitory effect on the d vulgaris cells in the presence of sulfide the solubility product constant of ag2s is 5 92 10 51 which means any silver leached from agnps will be immediately removed by sulfide forming ag2s our measurement indeed confirmed that silver ions in the agnps amended cultures were below the detection level of 0 001 mg l table s1 in comparison silver ions leaching from agnps was observed in milli q water and ls4d medium reaching concentrations of up to 1 34 mg l table s1 which suggests that the undetectable level of silver ions in the d vulgaris cultures amended with agnps was indeed most likely due to ag2s precipitation the absence of silver ions could partly explain why an inhibitory effect on d vulgaris cells was not observed in our experiments however it does not explain the stimulatory effects observed to further exclude potential contribution of silver ions d vulgaris was exposed to agno3 at ag concentrations 1 04 1 34 and 2 0 mg ag l corresponding to the silver ion concentrations released from agnps no stimulatory effect of ag on d vulgaris cell density or sulfur transformations was observed fig s3a and s4ac p 0 05 the formation of ag2s around d vulgaris cells could potentially alleviate the possible toxic inhibitory effect of sulfide on cells thus contributing to more favorable growth conditions for d vulgaris this could lead to a stimulatory effect when compared to control cells as observed in our experiments therefore sulfide treatment experiments were also carried out by spiking sulfide to achieve sulfide concentrations of 50 200 and 450 mg s2 l these concentrations are in the concentration range of sulfide produced in the control and agnps treated cultures there was no significant inhibition observed from the cell density and cell activity data i e sulfide production rate fig s3b and s4d p 0 05 collectively silver ion and sulfide did not incur significant inhibitory or stimulatory effect on the growth of srb suggesting a possibility that the silver nanoparticles themselves may have directly induced the stimulatory effects tem images of control and agnps 50 and 100 mg l treated cultures fig s5 revealed that some agnps were surrounding or attached to d vulgaris cells however the morphology and membrane structure of the treated cells were almost as intact as that of non treated cells suggesting that agnps did not damage d vulgaris cells edx analysis was preformed to describe the silver speciation in cultures after agnps addition the speciation of silver surrounding bacterial cells was also analyzed using edx fig s6 and both the characteristic ag peak and s peak was observed it was observed that both ag and s were mainly distributed outside the cells and some ag elements were overlapped with s thus it is assumed that the particle clusters around bacteria could be a mix of compounds or elements e g agnps ag2s nps and element s in order to investigate the potential impact of ag2s nps on the d vulgaris ag2s nps were dosed into the culture as shown in fig s3c s4e and s4f ag2s did not exert significant effect on the growth and sulfur metabolism of d vulgaris p 0 05 in another study of np toxicity viable cell proportions of e coli were seen to increase by 6 21 when exposed to agnps at 1 8 16 4 mg l table s2 xiu et al 2012 they suggested that agnps triggered repair mechanisms of the cells which overcompensated for the toxicity of the nps kawata et al 2009 also documented that addition of 0 1 0 5 mg l of agnps significantly increased the growth of hepg2 cells table s2 which could be described as an adaptive response to an initial disturbance in homeostasis kawata et al 2009 additionally it has been revealed that an adapted alteration in a histidine kinase protein gene lyts contributes to growth rate increase when the responses of d vulgaris to salt stress were investigated zhou et al 2015 these previous studies reported the stimulatory mechanism may attribute to the repair mechanisms of cells xiu et al 2012 the adaptive responses of cells kawata et al 2009 plasmon resonance wang et al 2013 and the adapted alteration in genes zhou et al 2015 until now the mechanism of hormetic response caused by agnps is still unknown which requires further studies the addition of agnps enhanced the anabolism of d vulgaris while its catabolic activities were not enhanced to the same degree in order to reveal the connections between cell density and the lactate sulfate metabolism we calculated the per cell substrate metabolic rates for the control and treated cultures after 24 h cultivation table 2 the results indicate that with the increase of cell density under agnps addition the specific lactate sulfate uptake rate and acetate sulfide production rate decreased in treated cultures it seems that the cell specific metabolic rate changed in cultures under agnps exposure which means the d vulgaris cells consumed less energy but generated more cells the growth yields of d vulgaris reported in previous studies also indicated that the growth yields could vary from different culture conditions badziong and thauer 1978 nethe jaenchen and thauer 1984 it is assumed that the presence of agnps might cause decoupling between anabolic and catabolic processes which warrants further investigations based on transcriptomics or proteomics it is noteworthy that less accumulation of sulfite and thiosulfate were observed in the cultures amended with agnps fig 3c and d which implies the presence of agnps facilitated the transformations from sulfite to thiosulfate then to sulfide since sulfate reduction takes place in the cytoplasm and electron storage may occur in the periplasm electrons will transverse the cytoplasmic membrane this process would involve several trans membrane complexes e g cytochrome c complex hmc type ii cytochrome c 3 complex tmc and the quinone interacting membrane bound oxidoreductase complex qmo in d vulgaris these complexes are proposed to partake in the sulfate reduction pathway zane et al 2010 however at present there are limited studies that investigate the effects of agnps exposure to cell metabolism 4 3 implications this study reports that agnps distinctly simulated the cell growth of d vulgaris under very high agnps dosages 50 or 100 mg l this unexpected finding changed our previous assumption that agnps usually exhibit inhibitory or biocidal impacts on environmental microorganisms discharged agnps will firstly be released into sewers and there the particles can potentially affect the growth of srb hydrogen sulfide produced by srb in sewers causes serious asset deterioration due to sulfide induced concrete corrosion sewer systems suffering from corrosion require significant capital investment for premature replacement or extensive sewer rehabilitation moreover odour resulting from h2s should be managed to meet the public demands for an odour free environment the practical control strategies for corrosion and odour problems essentially involves the inhibition of srb activity or removal of hydrogen sulfide by dosing some chemicals such as nitrate iron salts and free nitrous acid jiang et al 2011 this study suggested that no any significant stimulation or inhibition was found under agnps at environmentally relevant concentration e g 0 1 or 1 mg l implying there might not be necessary to worry about the negative effects of agnps on sewer management however most agnps are coming from pharmaceuticals and cleaning product use that will be more concentrated in this segregated wastewater an extremely high concentration or shock loading of agnps could be available in these particular sewer sections serving industrial areas thus probably posing risks to microbial communities if directly discharging concentrated wastewater into sewer systems further in situ studies are required to reveal the interactions between the agnps and the srb in sewer biofilms and sediments 5 conclusions exposures of cultured d vulgaris to agnps 1 100 mg l stimulated cell proliferation and cell viability while its catabolic activities were not enhanced to the same degree this is in contrast to the expected inhibitory and biocidal effects of agnps the observation that d vulgaris could be tolerant to up to 100 mg l agnps implies that bacteria like d vulgaris have the potential to stay viable under this high stress this stimulatory impact on cell growth of d vulgaris could potentially cause negative effects on sewer corrosion and odour management the mechanisms involved in the stimulation of cell proliferation and cell viability by agnps are still unclear transcript expression studies based on genome wide rna sequencing could be useful to identify the molecular mechanisms involved in the resistance of d vulgaris to agnps and their stimulatory effects acknowledgements we acknowledge the australian research council for funding support through the

19837,a novel phototrophic enhanced biological phosphorus removal photo ebpr system consisting of a consortium of photosynthetic organisms and polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos was studied in this work a sequencing batch reactor was fed with a mixture of acetate and propionate 75 25 and subjected to dark light cycles in order to select a photo ebpr system containing paos and photosynthetic organisms the latter likely providers of oxygen to the system the results from the selection period stage 1 showed that the photo ebpr culture was capable of performing p release in the dark and p uptake in the presence of light under limited oxygen concentrations during the optimization period the aeration period which was initially provided at the end of the light phase was gradually reduced until a non aerated system was achieved while the light intensity was increased after optimization of the operational conditions the selected consortium of photosynthetic organisms paos showed high capacity of p removal in the light phase in the absence of air or other electron acceptor a net p removal of 34 3 mg p l was achieved with a volumetric p removal rate of 15 2 mg p l h and 79 8 of p removal from the system also in limiting oxygen conditions the p uptake rate was independent of the pha consumption which demonstrates that the organisms obtained energy for p removal from light these results indicated that a photo ebpr system can be a potential solution for p removal with low cod p ratios and in the absence of air prospecting the use of natural sunlight as illumination which would reduce the costs of ebpr operation regarding aeration graphical abstract image 1 keywords enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos photosynthetic organisms phototrophs low energy 1 introduction phosphorus p is an element with vast applications in the chemical and food industry and particularly in the agronomical field cordell et al 2009 however despite p reserves being limited its utilization is continuously increasing for this reason p can be frequently found in water streams agricultural and industrial in concentrations susceptible of causing eutrophication and unbalanced ecosystems cai et al 2013 therefore it is crucial to treat the p containing streams and ideally to simultaneously recover this element and reuse it for example as fertilizer enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is a sustainable process used to remove p from wastewaters ww in which polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos compete for the limited supply of organic carbon sources namely volatile fatty acids vfas carvalheira et al 2014a the process relies on a specific group of bacteria paos that take up phosphate from ww in excess of their requirements under sequential anaerobic and aerobic periods yuan et al 2012 in the anaerobic period paos are able to hydrolyze intracellularly stored polyphosphate poly p and glycogen producing energy and reducing power to take up vfas and convert them into intracellular polyhydroxyalkanoates phas in the aerobic period paos oxidize the pha obtaining energy for replenishing glycogen levels for growth and p uptake in paos this p uptake is higher than the p released anaerobically leading to a net p removal from ww by concentrating it in the sludge and subsequent sludge wastage oehmen et al 2004 ebpr is a well known system with thoroughly optimized operational parameters but nevertheless requires aeration of the several factors that contribute towards operational costs in wastewater treatment plants wwtp aeration requirements are the most substantial with the goal of aeration reduction a new photosynthetic enhanced biological phosphorous removal system photo ebpr is proposed making use of a consortium culture composed by oxygen evolving photosynthetic organisms like microalgae cyanobacteria and bacteria paos in which the photosynthetic organisms can use light to produce the oxygen necessary for the system operation the novel photo ebpr configuration presented in this study is based on sequential dark and light cycles where in the dark phase with no oxygen production by photosynthetic organisms the system will be anaerobic and paos will take up vfas and convert them into pha using the energy from poly p and glycogen hydrolysis in the light phase photosynthetic organisms will use the light to produce atp while generating oxygen that can be used by paos to oxidize pha and obtain atp for p uptake it is known that microalgae can grow rapidly and thrive in stringent but illuminated conditions they require phosphorus for growth since it is an essential element for cellular constituents such as phospholipids nucleotides and nucleic acids nevertheless under certain conditions microalgae can be triggered to take up much more phosphorus than that necessary for growth this additional phosphorus uptake can be stored as polyphosphate which can then be used by the cell as an internal resource when the external phosphorus concentration is growth limiting with this feature algae can positively contribute towards p removal from wastewaters brown and shilton 2014 the bio treatment of wastewater with algae to remove nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus and to provide oxygen for aerobic bacteria was proposed over 50 years ago by oehmen et al 2004 abdel raouf et al 2012 nevertheless the use of a pao algae consortium to remove p via a photo ebpr process has not previously been demonstrated or studied this work intends to demonstrate the possibility of selecting an algal bacterial consortium that accumulates high phosphorus levels by applying dark light periods in a strategy analogous to conventional ebpr operation anaerobic aerobic periods during the 10 months of system operation the cod concentration was gradually increased sodium carbonate was introduced the light intensity was changed and air was gradually removed also this work evaluates the capacity of this new operating strategy in leading to a photosynthetic system with increased p removal capacity 2

cycle 5 min before the light period began other parameters like srt cod load light intensity time of aeration and settling time were also adjusted during the optimization stages 2 3 analytical methods

phosphate release prelease in mg p l was calculated as the difference between the phosphorus concentration in the end of the dark phase and the phosphorus concentration in the beginning of the dark phase total phosphate uptake puptake total in mg p l was calculated as the difference between the phosphorus concentration in the end of the light phase and the phosphorus concentration in the beginning of the light phase phosphate uptake in the light period puptake light in mg p l was calculated as the difference between the phosphorus concentration in the end of the light period before air supply and the phosphorus concentration in the beginning of the light period phosphate uptake in the light period in the presence of air puptake light air in mg p l was calculated as the difference between the phosphorus concentration in the beginning and the end of the aeration period pnet removal in mg p l was calculated as the difference of phosphorus concentration in the end and the beginning of the 8 h cycle removal efficiency is the difference between the phosphorus concentration in the end of the dark phase and in the end of the cycle dividing by the phosphorus concentration in the end of the dark phase active biomass x was calculated by subtracting pha and total carbohydrates from vss the yield of p uptake per pha consumed yp pha in p mmol c mmol was calculated by dividing the p uptake by the pha consumed at the determined period the specific p release rate q r in mg p mg x h the specific p uptake rates q u in mg p mg x h were determined by adjusting a linear regression line to the experimental concentrations determined along the different periods of the cycle and dividing the slope by the average of the concentration of the active biomass x during the cycle for the specific p release rate linear regression was made in the period of p release during the dark phase for specific p total uptake rate linear regression was made in the period of 4 h of light for specific p light uptake rate linear regression was made in the period of light with no air for specific p light and air uptake rate linear regression was made in the period of light and air 2 5 chlorophyll extraction and quantification to determine the culture chlorophyll content chlorophyll extraction was performed using the biomass pellet of 4 ml of reactor sample that had been previously centrifuged 5 min 8000 g and stored at 20 c after supernatant discharge to extract the chlorophylls 4 ml of ethanol 95 v v was added to the biomass pellet vortexed and incubated overnight at room temperature and in dark conditions afterwards samples were again centrifuged at 8000 g for 5 min and the absorbance spectrum of the supernatant was measured using an ultrospec 2100 pro amersham spectrometer the chlorophyll concentration was calculated according to lichtenthaler 1987 using the following equation c a b μg ml 5 24 a 664 2 22 24 a 648 6 where ca b accounts for the concentration of both chlorophyll a and b while a is the supernatant absorbance at the indicated wavelength 3 results and discussion 3 1 results 3 1 1 photo ebpr culture selection stage 1 the culture selection period stage 1 started with a feed concentration of 60 mg po4p l and a cod concentration of 60 mg l fig 1 a fig 2 three sequential phases were imposed to the reactor dark anaerobic light without external air supply and light with aeration during dark vfa uptake was immediately sustained by both phosphate release and carbohydrates consumption with concomitant pha production fig 1 a during the light phase phosphate was only taken up during the aerated period with phas being consumed and carbohydrates replenished cod was gradually increased from 60 to 160 mg cod l in the feed and by day 7 fig 1 b and more distinctively by day 14 fig 1 c the culture could already take up some phosphate during the light period with no aeration with the increase of the cod from 60 to 160 mg cod l in the feed the amount of phosphate uptake increased reaching more than 30 mg p l of net p removal the presence of light stimulated the growth of photosynthetic microorganisms like algae and cyanobacteria this is possible since the reactor inoculum was a mixed culture and as such already contained photosynthetic organisms even if in a marginal amount since the results from the selection stage indicated that the reactor could perform ebpr it was necessary to understand which are the optimal conditions for the photo ebpr operation thus 4 different optimization stages were carried out 3 1 2 process optimization the process optimization was divided in 4 stages stage 1 corresponds to the selection phase in stage 2 the system was supplemented with na2co3 srt was decreased from 20 to 10 days and aeration time was also reduced from 2 h to 1h30min in stage 3 cod was increased from 160 mg l to 200 mg l in the feed in stage 4 light intensity was increased to 600 w m2 and in stage 5 external aeration was completely removed table 1 the changes made in stage 2 led to an increase of the p release during the dark phase from 34 4 mg p l observed in stage 1 57 2 mg p l in stage 2 while maintaining high levels for total p uptake of 85 1 mg p l in all the light phase fig 3 a and p net removals of 27 5 mg p l fig 3 a table 2 this increase in p release should not be directly caused by the addition of na2co3 since this was only added 5 min before the beginning of light phase but be most likely due to the increase of pha accumulation and consumption during the dark and light phases respectively leading to higher p storage during the light phase and higher p release in the dark phase interestingly a 2 5 fold increase of the p uptake from 16 6 mg p l to 40 6 mg p l was observed in the non aerated light phase resulting in 47 of p being removed in this phase despite the enhanced p removal during the non aerated light phase only a small amount of pha was consumed δpha 1 08 0 4 c mmol l resulting in a yield of p removal per pha consumed yp pha of 1 37 0 54 p mol c mol as practically no pha was consumed during this period it can be hypothesized that p uptake was mainly done by photosynthetic microorganisms regarding the aerated light phase once the air was turned on pha consumption increased δpha 1 51 0 23 c mmol l table 2 and yp pha was 0 58 0 03 p mol c mol 2 times lower than in the non aerated light phase given the improved p uptake rates total light and light with air observed during stage 2 cod was increased from 160 to 200 mg l in the feed stage 3 fig 3 b as a consequence of higher carbon availability the biomass concentration increased and a higher total p uptake 94 4 mg p l was observed resulting in comparison with stage 2 in a lower effluent p concentration during stage 3 with a net p removal above 40 mg p l table 2 another implication of the cod increase was an augmentation of the net pha production during the dark period from 2 79 0 47 c mmol l in stage 2 6 59 1 74 c mmol l in stage 3 also in comparison to stage 2 a two fold increase on pha consumption δpha 2 22 0 71 c mmol l in the non aerated light period and a three fold increase δpha 5 36 1 36 c mmol l in the period with aeration was observed in stage 3 table 2 nevertheless from stage 2 3 no significant change was observed in all specific p release uptake rates q r q u it is known that the algae activity is influenced by light usually leading to more oxygen production with increased light intensities muñoz and guieysse 2006 in stage 4 fig 4 a the light intensity of the system was increased from 328 to 600 w m2 to mimic a summer day in portugal the higher light intensity resulted in an increase of biomass concentration from 3 79 g tss l in stage 3 4 21 g tss l in stage 4 table 2 however the most evident changes occurred during the light phase namely a constant p uptake and a much higher pha consumption in the non aerated period δpha 6 78 1 14 c mmol l resulting in a yp pha of 0 22 0 10 p mol c mol in the first 1 5 h of the light period the pha stopped to be consumed after 1 5 h of light with no air even when the air was turned on the specific p uptake rates were similar in the non aerated and aerated light period q u 7 1 mg p mg x h and q u 5 2 mg p mg x h respectively the vss tss ratio was similar in stage 3 0 68 0 01 and stage 4 0 69 0 01 table 2 one of the main goals of this study was to operate a photo ebpr system that did not require aeration but instead could use light to produce enough oxygen to drive phosphorus removal by the microbial community the results from the light phase in stage 4 suggested that p could be removed without external aeration however the impact of eliminating the aeration phase in terms of process capacity and culture performance had to be assessed therefore in the next step air supply was totally removed fig 4 b the results showed that the removal of air did not substantially affect the net p removal and the specific p release uptake values table 2 in fact despite the decrease in the biomass concentration 4 34 0 86 to 3 24 0 05 g tss l a net p removal of 34 3 mg p l was achieved the specific p release rate was maintained and the specific p uptake rate qu 6 0 mg p mg x h was similar as the one obtained in stage 4 table 2 moreover the p uptake was constant throughout the entire light phase as observed in stage 4 however in stage 5 two distinct pha profiles can be clearly observed with a relatively high pha consumption in the first 1 5 h period corresponding to a yp pha of 0 16 0 03 p mol c mol and a period with very low pha consumption in the last 2 5 h of the cycle associated with a continuous p removal with a yp pha of 1 22 0 06 p mol c mol microbial characterization by fish analysis table 3 showed an increase of the abundance of paos from stage 1 to stage 5 and more gao organisms were found in stage 5 showed by the application of cpb 654 probe also a steady increase of the presence of photosynthetic organisms was observed throughout the experimental work fig 5 with a co dominance shared with paos by stage 5 however despite the increase in gao abundance paos were still the dominant bacterial population present in the biomass table 3 the evolution of the photosynthetic organisms presence in the reactor could be followed through the sludge chlorophyll content fig 5 results show an increase of the chlorophyll content along the reactor operation from the residual value of 0 20 mg chl g vss presented at the beginning of the reactor operation up to 12 mg chl g vss at stage 5 fig 5 in stage 2 and 3 with a light intensity of 328 w m2 similar concentrations of chlorophylls were found 4 6 and 4 9 mg chl g vss respectively the increase of light intensity in stage 4 led only to a small increase of the chlorophyll concentration to 5 9 mg chl g vss however when external aeration was removed in stage 5 and the culture became dependent on light as energy source the chlorophyll concentration more than doubled to 12 mg chl g vss indicating the intensification of the amount of the photosynthetic microorganisms present in the photo ebpr culture 3 2 discussion 3 2 1 process optimization the results presented above showed that the photo ebpr system is an effective option for p removal using light instead of aeration to obtain such a system adequate conditions must be applied the and in order to select a photo ebpr culture interestingly the new ebpr system selected in this work shows a different trend in the correlation between pha and p as compared with the traditional ebpr process in photo ebpr oxygen availability seems to be the trigger factor for pha consumption but not for p removal by sequentially analyzing the results from stage 2 up to stage 5 it is likely that in stage 2 and 3 the culture was subjected to oxygen limiting conditions during the non aerated light phase fig s1 as a result pha consumption was low during the non aerated period and the observed p removal was likely due to the activity of photosynthetic organisms fig 3 when aeration commenced the culture had the availability of both oxygen and light which led to an increase of the p uptake rate since the culture could obtain energy from light and from pha oxidation in stage 4 the light intensity of the system was increased likely stimulating the oxygen production by algae cyanobacteria although not enough to increase the dissolved oxygen concentration in the light phase fig s1 nevertheless the increased auto oxygenation of the system appeared to shift the pha consumption to the early hours of the light phase however the p uptake rate remained constant throughout the entire light phase this indicates that while pha consumption was dependent on oxygen availability the p uptake was neither dependent on pha consumption nor on the oxygen availability per se since the presence of aeration in the last hours of stage 4 cycles fig s1 had no impact on the p uptake rate this was more clearly confirmed in stage 5 where aeration was completely removed and the p uptake rate was still constant during the entire light phase independently of pha consumption it is clear that p uptake is independent of pha consumption in stage 4 and 5 it can be hypothesized that when the auto oxygenation of the system increased microorganisms likely paos could consume pha in the first 1 5 h of the light phase but under oxygen limited conditions it is possible that under such conditions the energy requirement for maintenance may be higher than under a fully oxygenated system a possibility also suggested by the results of carvalheira et al 2014c when traditional pao systems were operated under limited oxygen conditions 0 1 0 3 mg o2 l if this is the case then the energy generated during pha consumption could meet the energy requirements for growth glycogen replenishment and maintenance but not for phosphate uptake also since fish results indicate a bacterial dominance by paos and in the dark phase the pha accumulation was associated with p release it can be speculated that paos may have other means to get energy to take up p during the light phase that does not depend on pha consumption indeed the presence of a photosynthetic population evidently capable of taking up p in the presence of light suggests that the pha consumption was not necessarily the dominant mechanism leading to p removal this is confirmed by the yp pha obtained in this study that ranged from 0 81 0 21 to 1 37 0 54 p mol c mol in certain periods of the light phase which are much higher than the values of 0 41 p mol c mol estimated by the model of smolders et al 1994 in traditional pao systems this seems to indicate that energy for p uptake during limited oxygen concentration levels was obtained from light future work will focus on clarifying this matter as well as ascertain which organisms are responsible for p uptake and through which mechanisms is the p preferentially removed another interesting observation is that the increase of light intensity from stages 2 3 to stages 4 5 did not lead to an increase of the p uptake rate during the non aerated light periods table 2 this suggests that at stage 2 and 3 the photosynthetic organisms were already being operated under light saturating conditions regarding their p uptake capacity finally this work indicates that by the end of stage 5 the mixed culture system was indeed capable of an enhanced p removal in transient illuminated conditions without the need of aeration regarding the final quality of the effluent p concentrations in stage 5 were over the limit discharge levels it should be referred however that this system was operated with an influent with a very low cod p ratio 3 3 mg cod mg p and a p concentration in the feed of 60 mg p l despite these demanding conditions the culture was in fact capable of a net p removal of 34 3 mg p l 3 2 2 impacts of the study the use of a photobioreactor for the treatment of wastewaters containing carbon and p was shown to be possible with a significant reduction elimination of the oxygen supply which might have a significant impact on operational costs in a wwtp on the other hand co2 was likely consumed in the system by photosynthetic organisms and its supplementation as na2co3 increased the global p removal this brings a further asset to the proposed photo ebpr system since it can potentially serve to sequester co2 emissions from off gas comparing the results obtained in this study with the ones obtained in some recent studies on ebpr performance it is possible to conclude that the proposed photo ebpr culture achieved higher net p removal with lower cod p ratios in stage 5 the net p removal obtained was 34 mg l with a cod p ratio of 100 30 while carvalheira et al 2014a 2014b only obtained 20 mg l of net p removal with a cod p ratio of 100 10 a recent study from valverde pérez et al 2016 using real wastewaters in laboratory tests obtained a net p removal of 10 mg l with a cod p ratio of 100 5 while comparing with results obtained in full scale wwtps with ebpr systems lópez vázquez et al 2008 indicated a net p removal of 10 4 mg l with a cod p ratio of 100 10 these results show that in the photo ebpr system much less carbon is required to remove the same amount of p broughton et al 2008 estimated that the limit of influent cod p ratio to be 100 7 7 for a conventional industrial ebpr wastewater treatment system considering that 30 ppm of p could be removed from a feed containing 200 mg cod our results show that this photo ebpr system can achieve cod p ratios approximately half of that achieved by a conventional ebpr system the results show the ability of the photo ebpr system to treat effluents with low carbon concentration and high p amount which can occur in agricultural wastewaters cai et al 2013 several studies focused on p removal in wastewater stabilization pounds wsp vendramelli et al 2016 leite et al 2009 powell et al 2009 powell et al 2008 showed p removal between 0 and 15 mg l by these systems with high hrt and srt which was less than what was obtained in this study high p influent concentrations of 30 mg l were tested by powell et al 2008 however in a 25 days test they could not remove all the phosphorus fed to the system while in the present work with 60 mg p l in the influent 79 8 of the p was removed in just 4 h like the present photo ebpr process wastewater treatment in wsp requires large land space as more than one pond with a high hrt is normally needed and the effluent is commonly only used as water for irrigation as it does not meet the discharge limits using the photo ebpr system some of these limitations of the wsp could be overcome as the natural diurnal cycle would permit wastewater treatment in one single reactor during the night no oxygen is produced by algae so the system is anaerobic and the cod is degraded during the day oxygen will be produced and nutrients will be removed either by photosynthetic organisms and or by other bacteria the low hrt of the photo ebpr system 12 h and the good quality effluent would allow efficient treatment of the wastewaters enabling the discharge of the effluent to natural water bodies and the application of the sludge as fertilizer in order to effectively operate this photo ebpr system at large scale a different process design would be required as compared to wsps a design that would maximize the contact between the natural sunlight and the mixed liquor photo ebpr systems can potentially be operated as stand alone processes with natural sunlight and no aeration or combined in phases with aeration periods to remove high levels of p with low cod p ratios e g industrial wastewaters it can be applied to wastewater treatment plants using the final p rich sludge as fertilizer or recovering the phosphorus for further reutilization although this system requires more available space to intensify the light capture and being situated in places with good solar exposition the photo ebpr system has low maintenance requirements as it is a low cost i e no aeration requirements and simple process to operate 4 conclusions this study demonstrates that a photo ebpr culture can be selected under transient illuminated conditions with no need of aeration results indicate the development of a photosynthetic organisms pao consortium capable of p release uptake cycles with a net p removal over 30 mg p l the uncoupling of p uptake from the pha consumption as well as the constant p uptake rate independently of oxygen availability suggests that the selected microorganisms are able to obtain atp for p uptake using light thus the photo ebpr system can be applied for the treatment of effluents with low cod p ratios lower than the values required for traditional ebpr systems with the addition that aeration can be minimized removed leading to costs reduction

19837,a novel phototrophic enhanced biological phosphorus removal photo ebpr system consisting of a consortium of photosynthetic organisms and polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos was studied in this work a sequencing batch reactor was fed with a mixture of acetate and propionate 75 25 and subjected to dark light cycles in order to select a photo ebpr system containing paos and photosynthetic organisms the latter likely providers of oxygen to the system the results from the selection period stage 1 showed that the photo ebpr culture was capable of performing p release in the dark and p uptake in the presence of light under limited oxygen concentrations during the optimization period the aeration period which was initially provided at the end of the light phase was gradually reduced until a non aerated system was achieved while the light intensity was increased after optimization of the operational conditions the selected consortium of photosynthetic organisms paos showed high capacity of p removal in the light phase in the absence of air or other electron acceptor a net p removal of 34 3 mg p l was achieved with a volumetric p removal rate of 15 2 mg p l h and 79 8 of p removal from the system also in limiting oxygen conditions the p uptake rate was independent of the pha consumption which demonstrates that the organisms obtained energy for p removal from light these results indicated that a photo ebpr system can be a potential solution for p removal with low cod p ratios and in the absence of air prospecting the use of natural sunlight as illumination which would reduce the costs of ebpr operation regarding aeration graphical abstract image 1 keywords enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos photosynthetic organisms phototrophs low energy 1 introduction phosphorus p is an element with vast applications in the chemical and food industry and particularly in the agronomical field cordell et al 2009 however despite p reserves being limited its utilization is continuously increasing for this reason p can be frequently found in water streams agricultural and industrial in concentrations susceptible of causing eutrophication and unbalanced ecosystems cai et al 2013 therefore it is crucial to treat the p containing streams and ideally to simultaneously recover this element and reuse it for example as fertilizer enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is a sustainable process used to remove p from wastewaters ww in which polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos compete for the limited supply of organic carbon sources namely volatile fatty acids vfas carvalheira et al 2014a the process relies on a specific group of bacteria paos that take up phosphate from ww in excess of their requirements under sequential anaerobic and aerobic periods yuan et al 2012 in the anaerobic period paos are able to hydrolyze intracellularly stored polyphosphate poly p and glycogen producing energy and reducing power to take up vfas and convert them into intracellular polyhydroxyalkanoates phas in the aerobic period paos oxidize the pha obtaining energy for replenishing glycogen levels for growth and p uptake in paos this p uptake is higher than the p released anaerobically leading to a net p removal from ww by concentrating it in the sludge and subsequent sludge wastage oehmen et al 2004 ebpr is a well known system with thoroughly optimized operational parameters but nevertheless requires aeration of the several factors that contribute towards operational costs in wastewater treatment plants wwtp aeration requirements are the most substantial with the goal of aeration reduction a new photosynthetic enhanced biological phosphorous removal system photo ebpr is proposed making use of a consortium culture composed by oxygen evolving photosynthetic organisms like microalgae cyanobacteria and bacteria paos in which the photosynthetic organisms can use light to produce the oxygen necessary for the system operation the novel photo ebpr configuration presented in this study is based on sequential dark and light cycles where in the dark phase with no oxygen production by photosynthetic organisms the system will be anaerobic and paos will take up vfas and convert them into pha using the energy from poly p and glycogen hydrolysis in the light phase photosynthetic organisms will use the light to produce atp while generating oxygen that can be used by paos to oxidize pha and obtain atp for p uptake it is known that microalgae can grow rapidly and thrive in stringent but illuminated conditions they require phosphorus for growth since it is an essential element for cellular constituents such as phospholipids nucleotides and nucleic acids nevertheless under certain conditions microalgae can be triggered to take up much more phosphorus than that necessary for growth this additional phosphorus uptake can be stored as polyphosphate which can then be used by the cell as an internal resource when the external phosphorus concentration is growth limiting with this feature algae can positively contribute towards p removal from wastewaters brown and shilton 2014 the bio treatment of wastewater with algae to remove nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus and to provide oxygen for aerobic bacteria was proposed over 50 years ago by oehmen et al 2004 abdel raouf et al 2012 nevertheless the use of a pao algae consortium to remove p via a photo ebpr process has not previously been demonstrated or studied this work intends to demonstrate the possibility of selecting an algal bacterial consortium that accumulates high phosphorus levels by applying dark light periods in a strategy analogous to conventional ebpr operation anaerobic aerobic periods during the 10 months of system operation the cod concentration was gradually increased sodium carbonate was introduced the light intensity was changed and air was gradually removed also this work evaluates the capacity of this new operating strategy in leading to a photosynthetic system with increased p removal capacity 2

phosphate release prelease in mg p l was calculated as the difference between the phosphorus concentration in the end of the dark phase and the phosphorus concentration in the beginning of the dark phase total phosphate uptake puptake total in mg p l was calculated as the difference between the phosphorus concentration in the end of the light phase and the phosphorus concentration in the beginning of the light phase phosphate uptake in the light period puptake light in mg p l was calculated as the difference between the phosphorus concentration in the end of the light period before air supply and the phosphorus concentration in the beginning of the light period phosphate uptake in the light period in the presence of air puptake light air in mg p l was calculated as the difference between the phosphorus concentration in the beginning and the end of the aeration period pnet removal in mg p l was calculated as the difference of phosphorus concentration in the end and

calculated by dividing the p uptake by the pha consumed at the determined period the specific p release rate q r in mg p mg x h the specific p uptake rates q u in mg p mg x h were determined by adjusting a linear regression line to the experimental concentrations determined along the different periods of the cycle and dividing the slope by the average of the concentration of the active biomass x during the cycle for the specific p release rate linear regression was made in the period of p release during the dark phase for specific p total uptake rate linear regression was made in the period of 4 h of light for specific p light uptake rate linear regression was made in the period of light with no air for specific p light and air uptake rate linear regression was made in the period of light and air 2 5 chlorophyll extraction and quantification to determine the culture chlorophyll content chlorophyll extraction was performed using the biomass pellet of 4 ml of reactor sample that had been previously centrifuged 5 min 8000 g and stored at 20 c after supernatant discharge to extract the chlorophylls 4 ml of ethanol 95 v v was added to the biomass pellet vortexed and incubated overnight at room temperature and in dark conditions afterwards samples were again centrifuged at 8000 g for 5 min and the absorbance spectrum of the supernatant was measured using an ultrospec 2100 pro amersham spectrometer the chlorophyll concentration was calculated according to lichtenthaler 1987 using the following equation c a b μg ml 5 24 a 664 2 22 24 a 648 6 where ca b accounts for the concentration of both chlorophyll a and b while a is the supernatant absorbance at the indicated wavelength 3 results and discussion 3 1 results 3 1 1 photo ebpr culture selection stage 1 the culture selection period stage 1 started with a feed concentration of 60 mg po4p l and a cod concentration of 60 mg l fig 1 a fig 2 three sequential phases were imposed to the reactor dark anaerobic light without external air supply and light with aeration during dark vfa uptake was immediately sustained by both phosphate release and carbohydrates consumption with concomitant pha production fig 1 a during the light phase phosphate was only taken up during the aerated period with phas being consumed and carbohydrates replenished cod was gradually increased from 60 to 160 mg cod l in the feed and by day 7 fig 1 b and more distinctively by day 14 fig 1 c the culture could already take up some phosphate during the light period with no aeration with the increase of the cod from 60 to 160 mg cod l in the feed the amount of phosphate uptake increased reaching more than 30 mg p l of net p removal the presence of light stimulated the growth of photosynthetic microorganisms like algae and cyanobacteria this is possible since the reactor inoculum was a mixed culture and as such already contained photosynthetic organisms even if in a marginal amount since the results from the selection stage indicated that the reactor could perform ebpr it was necessary to understand which are the optimal conditions for the photo ebpr operation thus 4 different optimization stages were carried out 3 1 2 process optimization the process optimization was divided in 4 stages stage 1 corresponds to the selection phase in stage 2 the system was supplemented with na2co3 srt was decreased from 20 to 10 days and aeration time was also reduced from 2 h to 1h30min in stage 3 cod was increased from 160 mg l to 200 mg l in the feed in stage 4 light intensity was increased to 600 w m2 and in stage 5 external aeration was completely removed table 1 the changes made in stage 2 led to an increase of the p release during the dark phase from 34 4 mg p l observed in stage 1 57 2 mg p l in stage 2 while maintaining high levels for total p uptake of 85 1 mg p l in all the light phase fig 3 a and p net removals of 27 5 mg p l fig 3 a table 2 this increase in p release should not be directly caused by the addition of na2co3 since this was only added 5 min before the beginning of light phase but be most likely due to the increase of pha accumulation and consumption during the dark and light phases respectively leading to higher p storage during the light phase and higher p release in the dark phase interestingly a 2 5 fold increase of the p uptake from 16 6 mg p l to 40 6 mg p l was observed in the non aerated light phase resulting in 47 of p being removed in this phase despite the enhanced p removal during the non aerated light phase only a small amount of pha was consumed δpha 1 08 0 4 c mmol l resulting in a yield of p removal per pha consumed yp pha of 1 37 0 54 p mol c mol as practically no pha was consumed during this period it can be hypothesized that p uptake was mainly done by photosynthetic microorganisms regarding the aerated light phase once the air was turned on pha consumption increased δpha 1 51 0 23 c mmol l table 2 and yp pha was 0 58 0 03 p mol c mol 2 times lower than in the non aerated light phase given the improved p uptake rates total light and light with air observed during stage 2 cod was increased from 160 to 200 mg l in the feed stage 3 fig 3 b as a consequence of higher carbon availability the biomass concentration increased and a higher total p uptake 94 4 mg p l was observed resulting in comparison with stage 2 in a lower effluent p concentration during stage 3 with a net p removal above 40 mg p l table 2 another implication of the cod increase was an augmentation of the net pha production during the dark period from 2 79 0 47 c mmol l in stage 2 6 59 1 74 c mmol l in stage 3 also in comparison to stage 2 a two fold increase on pha consumption δpha 2 22 0 71 c mmol l in the non aerated light period and a three fold increase δpha 5 36 1 36 c mmol l in the period with aeration was observed in stage 3 table 2 nevertheless from stage 2 3 no significant change was observed in all specific p release uptake rates q r q u it is known that the algae activity is influenced by light usually leading to more oxygen production with increased light intensities muñoz and guieysse 2006 in stage 4 fig 4 a the light intensity of the system was increased from 328 to 600 w m2 to mimic a summer day in portugal the higher light intensity resulted in an increase of biomass concentration from 3 79 g tss l in stage 3 4 21 g tss l in stage 4 table 2 however the most evident changes occurred during the light phase namely a constant p uptake and a much higher pha consumption in the non aerated period δpha 6 78 1 14 c mmol l resulting in a yp pha of 0 22 0 10 p mol c mol in the first 1 5 h of the light period the pha stopped to be consumed after 1 5 h of light with no air even when the air was turned on the specific p uptake rates were similar in the non aerated and aerated light period q u 7 1 mg p mg x h and q u 5 2 mg p mg x h respectively the vss tss ratio was similar in stage 3 0 68 0 01 and stage 4 0 69 0 01 table 2 one of the main goals of this study was to operate a photo ebpr system that did not require aeration but instead could use light to produce enough oxygen to drive phosphorus removal by the microbial community the results from the light phase in stage 4 suggested that p could be removed without external aeration however the impact of eliminating the aeration phase in terms of process capacity and culture performance had to be assessed therefore in the next step air supply was totally removed fig 4 b the results showed that the removal of air did not substantially affect the net p removal and the specific p release uptake values table 2 in fact despite the decrease in the biomass concentration 4 34 0 86 to 3 24 0 05 g tss l a net p removal of 34 3 mg p l was achieved the specific p release rate was maintained and the specific p uptake rate qu 6 0 mg p mg x h was similar as the one obtained in stage 4 table 2 moreover the p uptake was constant throughout the entire light phase as observed in stage 4 however in stage 5 two distinct pha profiles can be clearly observed with a relatively high pha consumption in the first 1 5 h period corresponding to a yp pha of 0 16 0 03 p mol c mol and a period with very low pha consumption in the last 2 5 h of the cycle associated with a continuous p removal with a yp pha of 1 22 0 06 p mol c mol microbial characterization by fish analysis table 3 showed an increase of the abundance of paos from stage 1 to stage 5 and more gao organisms were found in stage 5 showed by the application of cpb 654 probe also a steady increase of the presence of photosynthetic organisms was observed throughout the experimental work fig 5 with a co dominance shared with paos by stage 5 however despite the increase in gao abundance paos were still the dominant bacterial population present in the biomass table 3 the evolution of the photosynthetic organisms presence in the reactor could be followed through the sludge chlorophyll content fig 5 results show an increase of the chlorophyll content along the reactor operation from the residual value of 0 20 mg chl g vss presented at the beginning of the reactor operation up to 12 mg chl g vss at stage 5 fig 5 in stage 2 and 3 with a light intensity of 328 w m2 similar concentrations of chlorophylls were found 4 6 and 4 9 mg chl g vss respectively the increase of light intensity in stage 4 led only to a small increase of the chlorophyll concentration to 5 9 mg chl g vss however when external aeration was removed in stage 5 and the culture became dependent on light as energy source the chlorophyll concentration more than doubled to 12 mg chl g vss indicating the intensification of the amount of the photosynthetic microorganisms present in the photo ebpr culture 3 2 discussion 3 2 1 process optimization the results presented above showed that the photo ebpr system is an effective option for p removal using light instead of aeration to obtain such a system adequate conditions must be applied the and in order to select a photo ebpr culture interestingly the new ebpr system selected in this work shows a different trend in the correlation between pha and p as compared with the traditional ebpr process in photo ebpr oxygen availability seems to be the trigger factor for pha consumption but not for p removal by sequentially analyzing the results from stage 2 up to stage 5 it is likely that in stage 2 and 3 the culture was subjected to oxygen limiting conditions during the non aerated light phase fig s1 as a result pha consumption was low during the non aerated period and the observed p removal was likely due to the activity of photosynthetic organisms fig 3 when aeration commenced the culture had the availability of both oxygen and light which led to an increase of the p uptake rate since the culture could obtain energy from light and from pha oxidation in stage 4 the light intensity of the system was increased likely stimulating the oxygen production by algae cyanobacteria although not enough to increase the dissolved oxygen concentration in the light phase fig s1 nevertheless the increased auto oxygenation of the system appeared to shift the pha consumption to the early hours of the light phase however the p uptake rate remained constant throughout the entire light phase this indicates that while pha consumption was dependent on oxygen availability the p uptake was neither dependent on pha consumption nor on the oxygen availability per se since the presence of aeration in the last hours of stage 4 cycles fig s1 had no impact on the p uptake rate this was more clearly confirmed in stage 5 where aeration was completely removed and the p uptake rate was still constant during the entire light phase independently of pha consumption it is clear that p uptake is independent of pha consumption in stage 4 and 5 it can be hypothesized that when the auto oxygenation of the system increased microorganisms likely paos could consume pha in the first 1 5 h of the light phase but under oxygen limited conditions it is possible that under such conditions the energy requirement for maintenance may be higher than under a fully oxygenated system a possibility also suggested by the results of carvalheira et al 2014c when traditional pao systems were operated under limited oxygen conditions 0 1 0 3 mg o2 l if this is the case then the energy generated during pha consumption could meet the energy requirements for growth glycogen replenishment and maintenance but not for phosphate uptake also since fish results indicate a bacterial dominance by paos and in the dark phase the pha accumulation was associated with p release it can be speculated that paos may have other means to get energy to take up p during the light phase that does not depend on pha consumption indeed the presence of a photosynthetic population evidently capable of taking up p in the presence of light suggests that the pha consumption was not necessarily the dominant mechanism leading to p removal this is confirmed by the yp pha obtained in this study that ranged from 0 81 0 21 to 1 37 0 54 p mol c mol in certain periods of the light phase which are much higher than the values of 0 41 p mol c mol estimated by the model of smolders et al 1994 in traditional pao systems this seems to indicate that energy for p uptake during limited oxygen concentration levels was obtained from light future work will focus on clarifying this matter as well as ascertain which organisms are responsible for p uptake and through which mechanisms is the p preferentially removed another interesting observation is that the increase of light intensity from stages 2 3 to stages 4 5 did not lead to an increase of the p uptake rate during the non aerated light periods table 2 this suggests that at stage 2 and 3 the photosynthetic organisms were already being operated under light saturating conditions regarding their p uptake capacity finally this work indicates that by the end of stage 5 the mixed culture system was indeed capable of an enhanced p removal in transient illuminated conditions without the need of aeration regarding the final quality of the effluent p concentrations in stage 5 were over the limit discharge levels it should be referred however that this system was operated with an influent with a very low cod p ratio 3 3 mg cod mg p and a p concentration in the feed of 60 mg p l despite these demanding conditions the culture was in fact capable of a net p removal of 34 3 mg p l 3 2 2 impacts of the study the use of a photobioreactor for the treatment of wastewaters containing carbon and p was shown to be possible with a significant reduction elimination of the oxygen supply which might have a significant impact on operational costs in a wwtp on the other hand co2 was likely consumed in the system by photosynthetic organisms and its supplementation as na2co3 increased the global p removal this brings a further asset to the proposed photo ebpr system since it can potentially serve to sequester co2 emissions from off gas comparing the results obtained in this study with the ones obtained in some recent studies on ebpr performance it is possible to conclude that the proposed photo ebpr culture achieved higher net p removal with lower cod p ratios in stage 5 the net p removal obtained was 34 mg l with a cod p ratio of 100 30 while carvalheira et al 2014a 2014b only obtained 20 mg l of net p removal with a cod p ratio of 100 10 a recent study from valverde pérez et al 2016 using real wastewaters in laboratory tests obtained a net p removal of 10 mg l with a cod p ratio of 100 5 while comparing with results obtained in full scale wwtps with ebpr systems lópez vázquez et al 2008 indicated a net p removal of 10 4 mg l with a cod p ratio of 100 10 these results show that in the photo ebpr system much less carbon is required to remove the same amount of p broughton et al 2008 estimated that the limit of influent cod p ratio to be 100 7 7 for a conventional industrial ebpr wastewater treatment system considering that 30 ppm of p could be removed from a feed containing 200 mg cod our results show that this photo ebpr system can achieve cod p ratios approximately half of that achieved by a conventional ebpr system the results show the ability of the photo ebpr system to treat effluents with low carbon concentration and high p amount which can occur in agricultural wastewaters cai et al 2013 several studies focused on p removal in wastewater stabilization pounds wsp vendramelli et al 2016 leite et al 2009 powell et al 2009 powell et al 2008 showed p removal between 0 and 15 mg l by these systems with high hrt and srt which was less than what was obtained in this study high p influent concentrations of 30 mg l were tested by powell et al 2008 however in a 25 days test they could not remove all the phosphorus fed to the system while in the present work with 60 mg p l in the influent 79 8 of the p was removed in just 4 h like the present photo ebpr process wastewater treatment in wsp requires large land space as more than one pond with a high hrt is normally needed and the effluent is commonly only used as water for irrigation as it does not meet the discharge limits using the photo ebpr system some of these limitations of the wsp could be overcome as the natural diurnal cycle would permit wastewater treatment in one single reactor during the night no oxygen is produced by algae so the system is anaerobic and the cod is degraded during the day oxygen will be produced and nutrients will be removed either by photosynthetic organisms and or by other bacteria the low hrt of the photo ebpr system 12 h and the good quality effluent would allow efficient treatment of the wastewaters enabling the discharge of the effluent to natural water bodies and the application of the sludge as fertilizer in order to effectively operate this photo ebpr system at large scale a different process design would be required as compared to wsps a design that would maximize the contact between the natural sunlight and the mixed liquor photo ebpr systems can potentially be operated as stand alone processes with natural sunlight and no aeration or combined in phases with aeration periods to remove high levels of p with low cod p ratios e g industrial wastewaters it can be applied to wastewater treatment plants using the final p rich sludge as fertilizer or recovering the phosphorus for further reutilization although this system requires more available space to intensify the light capture and being situated in places with good solar exposition the photo ebpr system has low maintenance requirements as it is a low cost i e no aeration requirements and simple process to operate 4 conclusions this study demonstrates that a photo ebpr culture can be selected under transient illuminated conditions with no need of aeration results indicate the development of a photosynthetic organisms pao consortium capable of p release uptake cycles with a net p removal over 30 mg p l the uncoupling of p uptake from the pha consumption as well as the constant p uptake rate independently of oxygen availability suggests that the selected microorganisms are able to obtain atp for p uptake using light thus the photo ebpr system can be applied for the treatment of effluents with low cod p ratios lower than the values required for traditional ebpr systems with the addition that aeration can be minimized removed leading to costs reduction future studies will focus on improving the effluent p quality and operating the system under natural illumination conditions while further elucidating p uptake mechanisms acknowledgments the authors

19838,potassium ferrate k2feo4 is an effective oxidant that may be used as a pre or post oxidant in the purification of source water with cyanobacterial issues to provide a better basis for the application of this oxidant during water treatment processes the impacts of k2feo4 on the cell viability of microcystis aeruginosa and the fate of associated microcystins mcs were investigated in various water matrices the results showed that a water matrix can significantly affect the effectiveness of k2feo4 on cyanobacteria inactivation 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 induced significant cell lysis of m aeruginosa in ran yi tan reservoir rytr water while the membrane integrity was relatively unaffected in asm 1 media and cheng kung lake ckl water the reduced efficiency of k2feo4 oxidation may be attributed to the manganese mn2 and organic matter ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta in the asm 1 media and high concentrations of natural organic matters noms in the ckl water a delayed chick watson model was applied to simulate the experimental data for cyanobacterial cell rupture and the cell lysis rates of the m aeruginosa samples were determined to be 128 242 m 1 s 1 mol l 1 s 1 generally no significant increases in extracellular mcs were observed in the three different waters even in the rytr water where the membrane integrity of the cyanobacterial cells was severely disrupted therefore k2feo4 could be a potential pre oxidant to enhance subsequent treatments for cyanobacteria removal without affecting the cell integrity or could serve as a post oxidant to inactivate cyanobacterial cells and degrade mcs effectively depending on the specific water matrix graphical abstract image 1 keywords potassium ferrate oxidation microcystins cell integrity various waters 1 introduction cyanobacteria blue green algae usually prefer warm temperatures paerl and huisman 2008 could frequently form blooms in source waters which is a critical environmental problem worldwide the blooms can directly impair drinking water quality by producing tastes odors and toxic compounds e g microcystins mcs carmichael 1992 codd et al 2005 juttner and watson 2007 consequently various technologies have been progressively developed by researchers water suppliers to treat cyanobacteria issues for up stream reservoir management techniques such as aeration mixing and algicides are currently being applied to control cyanobacterial growth le jeune et al 2006 singleton and little 2006 for down stream water treatment plants wtps strategies including oxidation coagulation and filtration are utilized for cyanobacterial cell associated metabolite removal huo et al 2015 qi et al 2016 each of these technologies has its own advantages and drawbacks and thus water authorities usually implement multi barrier treatment options to reach the drinking water guideline standard developed by the world health organization and or their own countries one such barrier that has received widespread attention is the use of oxidants including chlorine ozone and potassium permanganate kmno4 for the mitigation of cyanobacteria and their metabolites wert et al 2014 fan et al 2014a oxidation is applied to achieve several goals depending on the specific circumstances such as 1 to inactivate cyanobacterial cells 2 to enhance the efficiency of subsequent coagulation through altering the surface characteristics and changes of cyanobacterial cells and 3 to oxidize the dissolved secondary metabolites odors and or toxins zhang et al 2011 qi et al 2016 however there are limitations with applications of these oxidation processes for instance chlorine can produce harmful by products that are toxic to mammals fang et al 2014 ferrate vi salts such as potassium ferrate k2feo4 are powerful oxidants that can remove a range of organic and inorganic contaminants effectively in potable water ballast water and wastewater jessen et al 2008 mura et al 2017 ferrate has also been shown to be an environmental benign chemical without generating harmful by products zhou et al 2014 furthermore the decomposition of ferrate vi produces fe iii which is a coagulant itself for aqueous pollutant removal jiang and lloyd 2002 consequently owning to its multiple benefits k2feo4 is considered to be an emerging chemical for water purification it has been reported that k2feo4 could be an efficient pre oxidant to enhance algae removal by followed coagulation sedimentation processes ma and liu 2002 zhou et al 2014 in addition this chemical has been shown to be promising as an efficient oxidant for mc degradation yuan et al 2002 jiang et al 2014 however most of these reported studies used pure mcs either commercial standard mcs or mcs extracted from cultured cyanobacteria while little information has been gathered on the relationship between ferrate and mcs in the presence of cyanobacterial cells oxidation of cyanobacteria laden water has been widely studied for chlorine and permanganate fan et al 2014a with appreciable variations in the rates of mc degradation being observed between cyanobacterial samples and pure mc solutions this may be attributed to the fact that oxidants can react with algal cells compromise the cell membrane and release intracellular metabolites into the surrounding water complicating the reacting mechanisms more than those in pure mc solutions consequently recent studies have evaluated oxidation processes including chlorine permanganate and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in water matrices with cyanobacteria samples with an emphasis on the assessment of cyanobacterial cell integrity and concomitant toxin fate fan et al 2014b 2016 huo et al 2015 similarly it is paramount to consider the effects of k2feo4 on the membrane integrity of cyanobacteria cells and associated toxin fate prior to its real application it is generally understood that the most notable disadvantage of ferrate is its instability the decomposition rate of ferrate strongly depends on its preparation method the initial ferrate concentration and solution conditions including co existing ions ph and temperature johnson and sharma 1999 therefore the water matrix may have a significant influence on the reactions of ferrate with cyanobacterial samples to date the appropriateness of k2feo4 for cyanobacteria treatment in various water matrices has not been systematically studied in particular under conditions that would be experienced in wtps consequently the aims of this study were to evaluate and compare the impacts of k2feo4 on the membrane integrity of a common cyanobacteria species microcystis aeruginosa in three different waters and assess the associated mc release and degradation at realistic wtp doses and conditions 2

were made using ultra pure water millipore pty ltd usa all experiments were performed at room temperature 25 2 c the purity of crystal k2feo4 was standardized by titration using a chromite method schreyer et al 1950 for every batch of experiments due to its instability fresh k2feo4 stock solution was then prepared by dissolving crystal k2feo4 in a 0 005 m sodium hydrogen phosphate buffer specific volumes of the stock solution were immediately spiked into the cyanobacterial samples to achieve the desired k2feo4 dosages k2feo4 concentrations in the samples were measured using a triiodide ion colorimetric method documented in luo et al 2011 a standard curve was constructed by diluting the stock solution to generate a range of k2feo4 concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 mg l 1 and compared to the linear relationship of absorbance at 351 nm in a 10 mm cuvette in a uv vis spectrophotometer 190 1100 nm perkin elmer usa a sodium sulfite na2so3 stock solution 5 mg l 1 was prepared to quench the reaction of k2feo4 and arrest further oxidation of the m aeruginosa cells 2 3 k2feo4 oxidation experiments and analysis the oxidation experiments were conducted in 1 l schott bottles the cyanobacterial samples were dosed with the desired k2feo4 concentrations 3 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 and mixed with a magnetic stirrer at a low speed samples were withdrawn at different reaction times up to 240 min and immediately analyzed to determine the residual k2feo4 at each time interval the samples were quenched with na2so3 and used for analysis of cell lysis enumeration of cell densities and measurement of mc concentrations the membrane integrity of the m aeruginosa cells was determined using a flow cytometer combined with sytox green stain daly et al 2007 the mc concentrations were analyzed using an enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay elisa kit huo et al 2015 extracellular mcs were separated from intracellular ones using filtration as indicated in huo et al 2015 for the analysis of the total intracellular extracellular mcs the unfiltered samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed at room temperature three times before the analysis scanning electron microscopy sem s3000 n hitachi japan was applied to observe the surface morphology of the m aeruginosa cells before and after k2feo4 oxidation in rytr water 3 results 3 1 the interaction of k2feo4 with m aeruginosa samples in asm 1 media k2feo4 added to asm 1 media with the absence of cyanobacterial cells were made as control the k2feo4 concentration decreased rapidly within 5 min with 3 3 and 13 3 mg l 1 present using 10 and 20 mg l 1 doses of k2feo4 respectively fig 1 a followed by slower decay over the remaining time decay of the oxidant in the presence of cyanobacterial cells cell density 1 105 cells ml 1 shared similar trends with those in the cell free asm 1 media cyanobacteria exerted a larger oxidant demand at the beginning and the k2feo4 concentrations decreased rapidly from 10 to 20 mg l 1 to 2 8 and 12 1 mg l 1 respectively within 5 min however there were negligible differences in the k2feo4 residuals between the control and cyanobacterial samples subsequently for instance an identical residual concentration of 0 42 mg l 1 remained in the control and m aeruginosa samples after 150 min using a 20 mg l 1 k2feo4 dose the percentage of intact m aeruginosa cells almost remained constant with the initial k2feo4 doses of 10 and 20 mg l 1 for 180 min fig 2 the concentrations of intracellular and extracellular mcs before exposure to 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 were 1 95 and 0 40 μg l 1 respectively fig 2a the intracellular mcs decreased to 0 69 μg l 1 after 180 min however there was no increase in the dissolved mcs observed during the 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 treatments rather these toxins were degraded to 0 06 μg l 1 after 180 min of contact time similarly the extracellular mcs were oxidized to below the initial concentration 0 53 μg l 1 during the course of the experiment with 20 mg l 1 k2feo4 meanwhile the intracellular mcs were oxidized from 1 73 to 1 47 μg l 1 after 20 mg l 1 k2feo4 treatment for 180 min fig 2b 3 2 the interaction of k2feo4 with m aeruginosa samples in ckl water assays were performed to determine the baseline degradation of k2feo4 with a cell free ckl water solution control and k2feo4 decay in the presence of cyanobacterial cells cell densities 1 105 cells ml 1 fig 1b the oxidants in both of control and cyanobacterial samples were consumed rapidly during the first 5 min and apparently more slowly in the subsequent time period the concentrations of k2feo4 residuals observed in the control samples during the reaction period were similar to those in the cyanobacterial samples where k2feo4 of 10 and 20 mg l 1 were added initially for instance the concentrations of k2feo4 20 mg l 1 initially declined with a residual of 0 14 and 0 13 mg l 1 detected after 180 min in the control and cyanobacterial samples respectively the membrane integrity of m aeruginosa cells was relatively unaffected n n0 0 96 using a k2feo4 dose of 10 mg l 1 fig 3 a while a higher concentration of k2feo4 20 mg l 1 resulted in consistent cell lysis with 23 of the cells impaired after 240 min fig 3b the m aeruginosa samples in the ckl water contained 2 27 μg l 1 mcs with 28 0 64 μg l 1 identified as extracellular before the 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 treatment fig 3a similar to the samples in the asm 1 media the extracellular mcs observed were below the initial concentration at all sampling times with a k2feo4 dose of 10 mg l 1 the remaining concentration of total mcs was 0 83 μg l 1 after 180 min and a 59 reduction of the intracellular mcs was also observed the concentration of total mcs before exposure to 20 mg l 1 k2feo4 was 3 28 μg l 1 with 28 0 93 μg l 1 of them being extracellular initially in the m aeruginosa samples fig 3b the intracellular mcs were degraded from 2 35 to 1 0 μg l 1 after 240 min the extracellular mcs were oxidized by 20 mg l 1 k2feo4 to a concentration of 0 18 μg l 1 after 180 min however the extracellular mcs increased to 0 78 μg l 1 after 240 min though it was still below the initial concentration 0 93 μg l 1 the increase in dissolved mcs was probably due to the leakage of intracellular mcs from damaged m aeruginosa cells fig 3b where the k2feo4 residual was inadequate to oxidize the released mcs fig 1b in general the results of 10 and 20 mg l 1 k2feo4 oxidation were similar in the asm 1 media fig 2 and ckl water fig 3 therefore data were processed using statistical analysis system 9 1 software sas usa and one way analysis of covariance ancova was performed to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference between the slopes of cell lysis and mc data there were no significant differences p 0 05 between the regression lines total extracellular mcs and cell integrity for 10 and 20 mg l 1 k2feo4 treatments in the asm 1 media for ckl water there were no significant differences p 0 05 between the regression lines of extracellular mcs for 10 and 20 mg l 1 k2feo4 treatments while there were significant differences between the regression lines of total mc and cell integrity for those two treatments 3 3 the interaction of k2feo4 with m aeruginosa samples in rytr water k2feo4 decomposition kinetics were measured in cell free rytr water control as well as m aeruginosa cultures cell density 1 105 cells ml 1 where k2feo4 doses of 3 5 and 10 mg l 1 were applied initially fig 1c different from the oxidation paths in the asm 1 media and ckl water the k2feo4 residual decreased steadily in all of the samples a residual concentration of 0 24 0 47 and 0 87 mg l 1 remained after 180 min with the initial doses of 3 5 and 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 respectively in the control samples similarly in the m aeruginosa samples there were 0 12 0 35 and 0 67 mg l 1 k2feo4 residuals detectable after 180 min respectively where 3 5 and 10 mg l 1 were added initially cyanobacterial samples with higher cell density 5 105 cells ml 1 were also applied to evaluate the k2feo4 treatments in rytr water fig 1d the k2feo4 decay trends in the control and m aeruginosa samples were similar to the lower cell density ones 1 105 cells ml 1 fig 1c k2feo4 residuals of 0 47 and 0 86 mg l 1 were detected with the initial k2feo4 doses of 5 and 10 mg l 1 applied after 180 min in the cell free rytr water samples the samples with cyanobacterial cells consumed more oxidant and the k2feo4 residual decreased steadily from 5 to 10 mg l 1 to 0 21 and 0 09 mg l 1 after 180 min respectively a significant loss of cyanobacterial membrane integrity was observed when the rytr water samples were treated with k2feo4 from 3 to 10 mg l 1 fig 4 a c and a visible alteration in cell wall morphology was observed fig 6 approximately 54 of the cyanobacterial cells cell density 1 105 cells ml 1 exposed to 3 mg l 1 k2feo4 lost membrane integrity within 240 min fig 4a higher concentrations of k2feo4 5 and 10 mg l 1 resulted in greater loss of membrane integrity the percentage of compromised cells increased to 93 n n0 0 07 after the 5 mg l 1 k2feo4 treatment for 150 min fig 4b and 99 n n0 0 01 of the cells exposed to 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 were impaired after 120 min fig 4c membrane integrity was less affected when m aeruginosa samples with greater cell density 5 105 cells ml 1 were applied for instance there were still 76 and 25 of the cells intact after 150 min of 5 and 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 exposure respectively fig 4d and e a decline of 54 82 and 80 of the total mcs in the m aeruginosa samples cell density 1 105 cells ml 1 was detected within 150 min of contact after dosing with 3 5 and 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 respectively fig 4a c substantial release of intracellular mcs was observed in the rytr samples the intracellular mcs decreased from 2 15 1 25 and 1 41 μg l 1 to 0 9 0 1 and 0 08 μg l 1 with k2feo4 doses of 3 5 and 10 mg l 1 respectively after 150 min the released mcs were subsequently oxidized with no significant increase in extracellular mcs in most cases however a slight build up of extracellular mcs from 0 11 to 0 20 μg l 1 was detected following the 5 mg l 1 k2feo4 oxidation for 120 min fig 4b the m aeruginosa samples with high cell density 5 105 cells ml 1 contained larger amounts of mcs initially fig 4d and e there were 20 0 and 14 3 μg l 1 of total mcs before exposure to 5 and 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 respectively consistent decreases in the intracellular mcs were observed when dosing with 5 and 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 however the observed extracellular mcs were below their initial concentrations during the k2feo4 treatments at all sampling times there were only 2 35 and 0 77 μg l 1 of total mcs remaining when applying 5 and 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 respectively after 210 min fig 4d and e 3 4 cell lysis rates of m aeruginosa samples in rytr water among the experiments conducted in the three water matrices only those in the rytr water exhibited distinct cell lysis under k2feo4 oxidation there was a lag phase existing before cell rupture for the m aeruginosa samples during k2feo4 treatments a lag phase has also been observed for hydrogen peroxide oxidation of unicellular m aeruginosa cells huo et al 2015 and chlorination of colonial m aeruginosa cells fan et al 2016 therefore a delayed chick watson model huo et al 2015 was applied to estimate the cell lysis rates for the k2feo4 treatment as shown in equation 1 1 ln n n 0 0 for t t k c c t t lag for t t lag where t min the contact time tlag min the lag phase time n0 the number of intact cells at t 0 n the number of intact cells after a given treatment c m the disinfectant concentration ct m min k2feo4 exposure and kc m 1 s 1 the rate constant at which lysis occurs the optimal model parameter values were acquired by minimizing the error sum of the squares between the observed and simulated values the data was not suitable for developing a model accurately when n n0 0 02 due to possible flow cytometer machine error therefore a delayed chick watson model was calculated using the data for n n0 0 2 table 2 the low ess and high r2 values indicated that the simulation was well developed the lag phase tlag was calculated according to clagtlag presented in table 2 the results showed that an increasing initial k2feo4 concentration could shorten the lag phase and that the tlag of the m aeruginosa samples with high cell densities was longer than that for samples with lower cell densities the lysis rates of k2feo4 with the m aeruginosa cells cell density 1 105 cells ml 1 in the rytr water were in the range of 128 242 m 1 s 1 in the case of the 5 105 cells ml 1 m aeruginosa cultures the rates for 5 and 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 oxidation were 170 and 228 m 1 s 1 respectively 4 discussion two natural waters filtered ckl and rytr waters were applied as the background waters in this study in addition to asm 1 media tests were conducted to culture m aeruginosa cells in filtered ckl and rytr waters to evaluate whether there was osmotic shock and possible death of m aeruginosa cells the results showed that all of the cell membranes remained intact during 240 min of incubation fig 5 therefore the influence on the membrane integrity of m aeruginosa cells was determined to be negligible when transferring them from the asm 1 media to the natural waters there were apparently higher oxidant demands in the asm 1 media and ckl water than in the rytr water under equivalent conditions fig 1 this may be attributed to a higher npdoc concentration 8 32 mg l 1 in the ckl water than in the rytr water npdoc concentrations ranged from 1 59 to 1 75 mg l 1 table 1 this was consistent with the findings of previous studies demonstrating that larger amounts of noms increased the oxidant demands in algae laden water fan et al 2016 contrarily the npdoc concentration of the asm 1 media 2 02 mg l 1 was considerably lower than that of the ckl water however the oxidant demands were relatively the same for the cyanobacterial samples in these two waters one possible reason for this is that there may be strong self decomposition of k2feo4 caused by various ions existing in asm 1 media such as nitrate no 3 and cobalt ions co2 table s1 supplementary materials it has been documented that ions like no 3 and co2 can significantly increase the self decomposition rates of k2feo4 licht et al 1999 in addition it has been proven that k2feo4 can remove manganese mn2 efficiently goodwill et al 2016 hence soluble mn2 concentration of 0 37 mg l 1 in asm 1 media can also consume a certain amount of k2feo4 contributing to overall oxidant demands also as a form of organic matter ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta in asm 1 media may accelerate k2feo4 degradation therefore in order to understand which components play important roles in ferrate decomposition 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 decay experiments were conducted in asm 1 media and the media in the absence of no 3 co2 mn2 or edta fig 7 the results showed that the decay path of the asm 1 media the media without no 3 and the media without co2 were similar thus neither no 3 nor co2 were the main component inducing the decomposition of k2feo4 instead the degradation of k2feo4 in the media without mn2 or edta was considerably slower than that in the asm 1 media consequently mn2 and edta are the major factors that could interfere with k2feo4 oxidation generally the k2feo4 decay path between the control without m aeruginosa cells and the m aeruginosa samples were similar for those in the asm 1 media ckl and rytr waters this disagrees with most of previous studies in which it was observed that algal samples had higher oxidant consumption and faster decay rates than control samples in most cases coral et al 2013 although the results of oxidant consumption in the cyanobacterial samples were similar to those in the control samples the cyanobacterial cells and associated mcs still could be affected by k2feo4 figs 2 3 and 4 one possible reason for this is that cyanobacterial cells and their mcs may prioritize consumption of k2feo4 rather than the substances in background waters the impacts of popular oxidation processes e g chlorine kmno4 and ozone on cyanobacteria cell viability and associated toxins have been well studied in laboratory media and natural waters lin et al 2009 zamyadi et al 2013 fan et al 2014b it has been proven that these oxidants can efficiently compromise cyanobacteria cells in contrast this study showed that cyanobacteria in asm 1 media had a strong resistance to k2feo4 oxidation with all of the cells retaining their membrane integrity during 240 min of treatment fan et al 2014b compared various oxidants e g chlorine kmno4 ozone and h2o2 for cyanobacteria treatments in asm 1 media and wastewater which had larger amounts of doc 6 0 mg l 1 different from k2feo4 those oxidants reported in fan et al 2014b had a stronger ability in compromising the membrane integrity of cyanobacterial samples in asm 1 media as compared to in wastewater this discrepancy may be attributed to the fact that k2feo4 exhibited a rapid self decomposition in the asm 1 media fig 1a resulting in inadequate oxidant residuals to inactivate cyanobacterial cells similar to those in the asm 1 experiments the membrane integrity of the cyanobacterial cells in the ckl water remained fairly constant using the initial k2feo4 dose of 10 mg l 1 however a gradual decline in cell integrity was evident in the 20 mg l 1 k2feo4 treatment although the doc content of the ckl water may have suppressed the efficiency of k2feo4 in disrupting the cell integrity of m aeruginosa samples the reduced efficiency was considerably larger than that found for the other oxidants especially in the experimental systems with high doc concentrations and algal cell density for example daly et al 2007 found that within 30 min a dose of 12 mg l 1 chlorine could inactivate 99 9 of m aeruginosa cell density 3 105 cells ml 1 in myponga reservoir water doc 16 9 mg l in south australia this suggests that k2feo4 may have a different mode of activity in oxidizing cyanobacterial samples also the reduced efficiency observed in the current study could be attributed to differences in water quality parameters including alkalinity ph and nom character k2feo4 was shown to have the greatest impact on the viability of m aeruginosa cells in rytr water amongst all of the investigated waters in this study however a lag phase was observed before cell rupture for all m aeruginosa samples exposed to 3 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 the m aeruginosa sample cell density 5 105 cells ml 1 treated with 5 mg l 1 k2feo4 had the longest delay time 139 5 min this agrees with huo et al 2015 who documented that there was a lag phase in cell rupture when h2o2 was applied to treat m aeruginosa pcc 7820 the same strain used in the present study it is possible that the cell bound mucilage reacted with the oxidant and protected the cell membrane from oxidant attack huo et al 2015 fan et al 2016 in this study a delayed chick watson model was used to simulate the cell inactivation data however the majority of previous studies used a chick watson model since cell rupture generally occurred when oxidation started daly et al 2007 zamyadi et al 2013 fan et al 2014a this phenomenon could be attributed to different types of oxidants oxidant dosages and water matrix colony formation and the variations between cyanobacteria species lin et al 2009 fan et al 2016 therefore the water suppliers should choose the proper model to simulate data according to specific combinations of oxidants water matrices and cyanobacteria species in particular it should be noticed whether there is a lag phase existing before cyanobacterial cell rupture which has been neglected previously the cell lysis rates of the m aeruginosa samples in rytr water by k2feo4 treatments were determined to be 128 242 m 1 s 1 in this study a previous study also evaluated the cell lysis rates of m aeruginosa samples by chlorination in rytr water and the observed rate constant was 430 m 1 s 1 lin et al 2009 which was slightly higher than those in this study however the cell density of the m aeruginosa samples 1 6 104 cells ml 1 used by lin et al 2009 was considerably lower than that of the present study 1 0 105 cells ml 1 or 5 0 105 cells ml 1 therefore the efficiency of k2feo4 in compromising cyanobacterial cells is generally comparable to that of chlorine treatment which is recognized as an efficient oxidant fig 6 further indicates that ferrate vi can induce cyanobacterial cell damage although the membrane integrity was relatively unaffected n n0 0 95 and there was no leakage of intracellular mcs after 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 oxidation for 30 min fig 4c a visible alteration in the cell morphology has been observed by sem at that time fig 6b this suggested that the cyanobacterial cells were unhealthy after ferrate oxidation for 30 min however there might be a delay for the occurrence of membrane damage and mc release the cyanobacterial cells became deflated and shrank to a smaller size after a longer contact time fig 6c e which indicated that the cells were further compromised by the k2feo4 treatment considering together the results from the sem photos fig 6 and the cell integrity and mc concentrations fig 4 sem may provide a visual indication of cell morphology and however cell integrity and mc release is difficult to be directly reflected from the photos as the damage may be too small to be visible the decomposed products of ferrate vi ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 colloids were observed on the cell surface fig 6 which could facilitate conglomeration of algal cells and enhance the subsequent coagulation process ma and liu 2002 zhou et al 2014 it has been demonstrated that k2feo4 could effectively degrade spiked toxins in ultrapure and natural waters jiang et al 2014 few studies have evaluated the fates of cyanotoxins in the presence of cyanobacterial cells using k2feo4 as an oxidant this study showed that k2feo4 could remove both of the intracellular and extracellular mcs from cyanobacterial cells in asm 1 media and ckl water with their membranes relatively unaffected this finding agrees with studies by fan et al 2014b who indicated that kmno4 3 mg l 1 could oxidize intracellular mcs effectively with the cyanobacterial cell membrane remaining intact one possibility for this is that the cyanobacterial cells are stressed unhealthy after oxidation though they are still intact thus they may release more toxins to protect themselves alternatively the self decomposition of k2feo4 may produce reactive oxygen species ros and h2o2 sharma et al 2015 which may enter into cells and oxidize intracellular mcs in addition it is possible that algae could form intracellular ros as a response to environmental stress for instance a previous study has reported that production of intracellular ros in algal cells was observed after the addition of 50 250 nm copper knauert and knauer 2008 in the case of the samples in rytr water k2feo4 also showed a strong ability to oxidize mcs even for samples with high cell density and high concentrations of mcs the total mc level was reduced by 95 fig 4e the investigations in this study were laboratory based and this should be taken into account when assessing the efficiency and risks of full scale treatment in wtps in addition water parameters such as doc and possible metals could significantly reduce the amount of k2feo4 available to act upon cyanobacterial cells thus these interferences need to be considered when determining dose levels under real situations 5 conclusions the results of this study indicated that k2feo4 could inactivate m aeruginosa cells to varying degrees in natural waters but the efficiency could be significantly reduced by noms the cells retained membrane integrity in the asm 1 media probably due to the self decomposition of k2feo4 caused by the presence of mn2 and organic matter edta in the media therefore depending on the water matrix in drinking water treatment processes k2feo4 could be applied as a post oxidant to inactivate cyanobacterial cells or as a pre oxidant without affecting cyanobacterial cell integrity it was shown that k2feo4 was able to oxidize the released mcs rapidly and no increase of extracellular mcs was observed under the majority of experimental conditions although pilot field studies in water treatment plants are needed to evaluate the dosage point of application influence of a water matrix and impact on coagulation sedimentation processes k2feo4 can be considered as a potential oxidant for cyanobacteria and their associated toxin treatment in drinking water treatment processes acknowledgements this research is supported by taiwan ministry of science and technology number most 104 2221 e 006 021 my3

19838,potassium ferrate k2feo4 is an effective oxidant that may be used as a pre or post oxidant in the purification of source water with cyanobacterial issues to provide a better basis for the application of this oxidant during water treatment processes the impacts of k2feo4 on the cell viability of microcystis aeruginosa and the fate of associated microcystins mcs were investigated in various water matrices the results showed that a water matrix can significantly affect the effectiveness of k2feo4 on cyanobacteria inactivation 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 induced significant cell lysis of m aeruginosa in ran yi tan reservoir rytr water while the membrane integrity was relatively unaffected in asm 1 media and cheng kung lake ckl water the reduced efficiency of k2feo4 oxidation may be attributed to the manganese mn2 and organic matter ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta in the asm 1 media and high concentrations of natural organic matters noms in the ckl water a delayed chick watson model was applied to simulate the experimental data for cyanobacterial cell rupture and the cell lysis rates of the m aeruginosa samples were determined to be 128 242 m 1 s 1 mol l 1 s 1 generally no significant increases in extracellular mcs were observed in the three different waters even in the rytr water where the membrane integrity of the cyanobacterial cells was severely disrupted therefore k2feo4 could be a potential pre oxidant to enhance subsequent treatments for cyanobacteria removal without affecting the cell integrity or could serve as a post oxidant to inactivate cyanobacterial cells and degrade mcs effectively depending on the specific water matrix graphical abstract image 1 keywords potassium ferrate oxidation microcystins cell integrity various waters 1 introduction cyanobacteria blue green algae usually prefer warm temperatures paerl and huisman 2008 could frequently form blooms in source waters which is a critical environmental problem worldwide the blooms can directly impair drinking water quality by producing tastes odors and toxic compounds e g microcystins mcs carmichael 1992 codd et al 2005 juttner and watson 2007 consequently various technologies have been progressively developed by researchers water suppliers to treat cyanobacteria issues for up stream reservoir management techniques such as aeration mixing and algicides are currently being applied to control cyanobacterial growth le jeune et al 2006 singleton and little 2006 for down stream water treatment plants wtps strategies including oxidation coagulation and filtration are utilized for cyanobacterial cell associated metabolite removal huo et al 2015 qi et al 2016 each of these technologies has its own advantages and drawbacks and thus water authorities usually implement multi barrier treatment options to reach the drinking water guideline standard developed by the world health organization and or their own countries one such barrier that has received widespread attention is the use of oxidants including chlorine ozone and potassium permanganate kmno4 for the mitigation of cyanobacteria and their metabolites wert et al 2014 fan et al 2014a oxidation is applied to achieve several goals depending on the specific circumstances such as 1 to inactivate cyanobacterial cells 2 to enhance the efficiency of subsequent coagulation through altering the surface characteristics and changes of cyanobacterial cells and 3 to oxidize the dissolved secondary metabolites odors and or toxins zhang et al 2011 qi et al 2016 however there are limitations with applications of these oxidation processes for instance chlorine can produce harmful by products that are toxic to mammals fang et al 2014 ferrate vi salts such as potassium ferrate k2feo4 are powerful oxidants that can remove a range of organic and inorganic contaminants effectively in potable water ballast water and wastewater jessen et al 2008 mura et al 2017 ferrate has also been shown to be an environmental benign chemical without generating harmful by products zhou et al 2014 furthermore the decomposition of ferrate vi produces fe iii which is a coagulant itself for aqueous pollutant removal jiang and lloyd 2002 consequently owning to its multiple benefits k2feo4 is considered to be an emerging chemical for water purification it has been reported that k2feo4 could be an efficient pre oxidant to enhance algae removal by followed coagulation sedimentation processes ma and liu 2002 zhou et al 2014 in addition this chemical has been shown to be promising as an efficient oxidant for mc degradation yuan et al 2002 jiang et al 2014 however most of these reported studies used pure mcs either commercial standard mcs or mcs extracted from cultured cyanobacteria while little information has been gathered on the relationship between ferrate and mcs in the presence of cyanobacterial cells oxidation of cyanobacteria laden water has been widely studied for chlorine and permanganate fan et al 2014a with appreciable variations in the rates of mc degradation being observed between cyanobacterial samples and pure mc solutions this may be attributed to the fact that oxidants can react with algal cells compromise the cell membrane and release intracellular metabolites into the surrounding water complicating the reacting mechanisms more than those in pure mc solutions consequently recent studies have evaluated oxidation processes including chlorine permanganate and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in water matrices with cyanobacteria samples with an emphasis on the assessment of cyanobacterial cell integrity and concomitant toxin fate fan et al 2014b 2016 huo et al 2015 similarly it is paramount to consider the effects of k2feo4 on the membrane integrity of cyanobacteria cells and associated toxin fate prior to its real application it is generally understood that the most notable disadvantage of ferrate is its instability the decomposition rate of ferrate strongly depends on its preparation method the initial ferrate concentration and solution conditions including co existing ions ph and temperature johnson and sharma 1999 therefore the water matrix may have a significant influence on the reactions of ferrate with cyanobacterial samples to date the appropriateness of k2feo4 for cyanobacteria treatment in various water matrices has not been systematically studied in particular under conditions that would be experienced in wtps consequently the aims of this study were to evaluate and compare the impacts of k2feo4 on the membrane integrity of a common cyanobacteria species microcystis aeruginosa in three different waters and assess the associated mc release and degradation at realistic wtp doses and conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 water source and quality raw waters were obtained from ran yi tan reservoir rytr and cheng kung lake ckl which are located in taiwan the sampled waters were filtered through

enumerated with a microscope bx 51 olympus japan at 400 magnification using a sedgewick rafter counting chamber s52 pyser sgi uk the m aeruginosa cultures were spiked into the prepared waters asm 1 media rytr water or ckl water to achieve an initial cell density of 1 0 105 or 5 0 105 cells ml 1 for the subsequent experiments prior to use in the oxidation experiments the cyanobacterial samples were adjusted to ph 8 0 0 1 at ambient ph either using 0 1m sterile filtered hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide all chemicals and reagents used in this study were analytical grade and solutions were made using ultra pure water millipore pty ltd usa all experiments were performed at room temperature 25 2 c the purity of crystal k2feo4 was standardized by titration using a chromite method schreyer et al 1950 for every batch of experiments due to its instability fresh k2feo4 stock solution was then prepared by dissolving crystal k2feo4 in a 0 005 m sodium hydrogen phosphate buffer specific volumes of the stock solution were immediately spiked into the cyanobacterial samples to achieve the desired k2feo4 dosages k2feo4 concentrations in the samples were measured using a triiodide ion colorimetric method documented in luo et al 2011 a standard curve was constructed by diluting the stock solution to generate a range of k2feo4 concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 mg l 1 and compared to the linear relationship of absorbance at 351 nm in a 10 mm cuvette in a uv vis spectrophotometer 190 1100 nm perkin elmer usa a sodium sulfite na2so3 stock solution 5 mg l 1 was prepared to quench the reaction of k2feo4 and arrest further oxidation of the m aeruginosa cells 2 3 k2feo4 oxidation experiments and analysis the oxidation experiments were conducted in 1 l schott bottles the cyanobacterial samples were dosed with the desired k2feo4 concentrations 3 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 and mixed with a magnetic stirrer at a low speed samples were withdrawn at different reaction times up to 240 min and immediately analyzed to determine the residual k2feo4 at each time interval the samples were quenched with na2so3 and used for analysis of cell lysis enumeration of cell densities and measurement of mc concentrations the membrane integrity of the m aeruginosa cells was determined using a flow cytometer combined with sytox green stain daly et al 2007 the mc concentrations were analyzed using an enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay elisa kit huo et al 2015 extracellular mcs were separated from intracellular ones using filtration as indicated in huo et al 2015 for the analysis of the total intracellular extracellular mcs the unfiltered samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed at room temperature three times before the analysis scanning electron microscopy sem s3000 n hitachi japan was applied to observe the surface morphology of the m aeruginosa cells before and after k2feo4 oxidation in rytr water 3 results 3 1 the interaction of k2feo4 with m aeruginosa samples in asm 1 media k2feo4 added to asm 1 media with the absence of cyanobacterial cells were made as control the k2feo4 concentration decreased rapidly within 5 min with 3 3 and 13 3 mg l 1 present using 10 and 20 mg l 1 doses of k2feo4 respectively fig 1 a followed by slower decay over the remaining time decay of the oxidant in the presence of cyanobacterial cells cell density 1 105 cells ml 1 shared similar trends with those in the cell free asm 1 media cyanobacteria exerted a larger oxidant demand at the beginning and the k2feo4 concentrations decreased rapidly from 10 to 20 mg l 1 to 2 8 and 12 1 mg l 1 respectively within 5 min however there were negligible differences in the k2feo4 residuals between the control and cyanobacterial samples subsequently for instance an identical residual concentration of 0 42 mg l 1 remained in the control and m aeruginosa samples after 150 min using a 20 mg l 1 k2feo4 dose the percentage of intact m aeruginosa cells almost remained constant with the initial k2feo4 doses of 10 and 20 mg l 1 for 180 min fig 2 the concentrations of intracellular and extracellular mcs before exposure to 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 were 1 95 and 0 40 μg l 1 respectively fig 2a the intracellular mcs decreased to 0 69 μg l 1 after 180 min however there was no increase in the dissolved mcs observed during the 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 treatments rather these toxins were degraded to 0 06 μg l 1 after 180 min of contact time similarly the extracellular mcs were oxidized to below the initial concentration 0 53 μg l 1 during the course of the experiment with 20 mg l 1 k2feo4 meanwhile the intracellular mcs were oxidized from 1 73 to 1 47 μg l 1 after 20 mg l 1 k2feo4 treatment for 180 min fig 2b 3 2 the interaction of k2feo4 with m aeruginosa samples in ckl water assays were performed to determine the baseline degradation of k2feo4 with a cell free ckl water solution control and k2feo4 decay in the presence of cyanobacterial cells cell densities 1 105 cells ml 1 fig 1b the oxidants in both of control and cyanobacterial samples were consumed rapidly during the first 5 min and apparently more slowly in the subsequent time period the concentrations of k2feo4 residuals observed in the control samples during the reaction period were similar to those in the cyanobacterial samples where k2feo4 of 10 and 20 mg l 1 were added initially for instance the concentrations of k2feo4 20 mg l 1 initially declined with a residual of 0 14 and 0 13 mg l 1 detected after 180 min in the control and cyanobacterial samples respectively the membrane integrity of m aeruginosa cells was relatively unaffected n n0 0 96 using a k2feo4 dose of 10 mg l 1 fig 3 a while a higher concentration of k2feo4 20 mg l 1 resulted in consistent cell lysis with 23 of the cells impaired after 240 min fig 3b the m aeruginosa samples in the ckl water contained 2 27 μg l 1 mcs with 28 0 64 μg l 1 identified as extracellular before the 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 treatment fig 3a similar to the samples in the asm 1 media the extracellular mcs observed were below the initial concentration at all sampling times with a k2feo4 dose of 10 mg l 1 the remaining concentration of total mcs was 0 83 μg l 1 after 180 min and a 59 reduction of the intracellular mcs was also observed the concentration of total mcs before exposure to 20 mg l 1 k2feo4 was 3 28 μg l 1 with 28 0 93 μg l 1 of them being extracellular initially in the m aeruginosa samples fig 3b the intracellular mcs were degraded from 2 35 to 1 0 μg l 1 after 240 min the extracellular mcs were oxidized by 20 mg l 1 k2feo4 to a concentration of 0 18 μg l 1 after 180 min however the extracellular mcs increased to 0 78 μg l 1 after 240 min though it was still below the initial concentration 0 93 μg l 1 the increase in dissolved mcs was probably due to the leakage of intracellular mcs from damaged m aeruginosa cells fig 3b where the k2feo4 residual was inadequate to oxidize the released mcs fig 1b in general the results of 10 and 20 mg l 1 k2feo4 oxidation were similar in the asm 1 media fig 2 and ckl water fig 3 therefore data were processed using statistical analysis system 9 1 software sas usa and one way analysis of covariance ancova was performed to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference between the slopes of cell lysis and mc data there were no significant differences p 0 05 between the regression lines total extracellular mcs and cell integrity for 10 and 20 mg l 1 k2feo4 treatments in the asm 1 media for ckl water there were no significant differences p 0 05 between the regression lines of extracellular mcs for 10 and 20 mg l 1 k2feo4 treatments while there were significant differences between the regression lines of total mc and cell integrity for those two treatments 3 3 the interaction of k2feo4 with m aeruginosa samples in rytr water k2feo4 decomposition kinetics were measured in cell free rytr water control as well as m aeruginosa cultures cell density 1 105 cells ml 1 where k2feo4 doses of 3 5 and 10 mg l 1 were applied initially fig 1c different from the oxidation paths in the asm 1 media and ckl water the k2feo4 residual decreased steadily in all of the samples a residual concentration of 0 24 0 47 and 0 87 mg l 1 remained after 180 min with the initial doses of 3 5 and 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 respectively in the control samples similarly in the m aeruginosa samples there were 0 12 0 35 and 0 67 mg l 1 k2feo4 residuals detectable after 180 min respectively where 3 5 and 10 mg l 1 were added initially cyanobacterial samples with higher cell density 5 105 cells ml 1 were also applied to evaluate the k2feo4 treatments in rytr water fig 1d the k2feo4 decay trends in the control and m aeruginosa samples were similar to the lower cell density ones 1 105 cells ml 1 fig 1c k2feo4 residuals of 0 47 and 0 86 mg l 1 were detected with the initial k2feo4 doses of 5 and 10 mg l 1 applied after 180 min in the cell free rytr water samples the samples with cyanobacterial cells consumed more oxidant and the k2feo4 residual decreased steadily from 5 to 10 mg l 1 to 0 21 and 0 09 mg l 1 after 180 min respectively a significant loss of cyanobacterial membrane integrity was observed when the rytr water samples were treated with k2feo4 from 3 to 10 mg l 1 fig 4 a c and a visible alteration in cell wall morphology was observed fig 6 approximately 54 of the cyanobacterial cells cell density 1 105 cells ml 1 exposed to 3 mg l 1 k2feo4 lost membrane integrity within 240 min fig 4a higher concentrations of k2feo4 5 and 10 mg l 1 resulted in greater loss of membrane integrity the percentage of compromised cells increased to 93 n n0 0 07 after the 5 mg l 1 k2feo4 treatment for 150 min fig 4b and 99 n n0 0 01 of the cells exposed to 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 were impaired after 120 min fig 4c membrane integrity was less affected when m aeruginosa samples with greater cell density 5 105 cells ml 1 were applied for instance there were still 76 and 25 of the cells intact after 150 min of 5 and 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 exposure respectively fig 4d and e a decline of 54 82 and 80 of the total mcs in the m aeruginosa samples cell density 1 105 cells ml 1 was detected within 150 min of contact after dosing with 3 5 and 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 respectively fig 4a c substantial release of intracellular mcs was observed in the rytr samples the intracellular mcs decreased from 2 15 1 25 and 1 41 μg l 1 to 0 9 0 1 and 0 08 μg l 1 with k2feo4 doses of 3 5 and 10 mg l 1 respectively after 150 min the released mcs were subsequently oxidized with no significant increase in extracellular mcs in most cases however a slight build up of extracellular mcs from 0 11 to 0 20 μg l 1 was detected following the 5 mg l 1 k2feo4 oxidation for 120 min fig 4b the m aeruginosa samples with high cell density 5 105 cells ml 1 contained larger amounts of mcs initially fig 4d and e there were 20 0 and 14 3 μg l 1 of total mcs before exposure to 5 and 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 respectively consistent decreases in the intracellular mcs were observed when dosing with 5 and 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 however the observed extracellular mcs were below their initial concentrations during the k2feo4 treatments at all sampling times there were only 2 35 and 0 77 μg l 1 of total mcs remaining when applying 5 and 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 respectively after 210 min fig 4d and e 3 4 cell lysis rates of m aeruginosa samples in rytr water among the experiments conducted in the three water matrices only those in the rytr water exhibited distinct cell lysis under k2feo4 oxidation there was a lag phase existing before cell rupture for the m aeruginosa samples during k2feo4 treatments a lag phase has also been observed for hydrogen peroxide oxidation of unicellular m aeruginosa cells huo et al 2015 and chlorination of colonial m aeruginosa cells fan et al 2016 therefore a delayed chick watson model huo et al 2015 was applied to estimate the cell lysis rates for the k2feo4 treatment as shown in equation 1 1 ln n n 0 0 for t t k c c t t lag for t t lag where t min the contact time tlag min the lag phase time n0 the number of intact cells at t 0 n the number of intact cells after a given treatment c m the disinfectant concentration ct m min k2feo4 exposure and kc m 1 s 1 the rate constant at which lysis occurs the optimal model parameter values were acquired by minimizing the error sum of the squares between the observed and simulated values the data was not suitable for developing a model accurately when n n0 0 02 due to possible flow cytometer machine error therefore a delayed chick watson model was calculated using the data for n n0 0 2 table 2 the low ess and high r2 values indicated that the simulation was well developed the lag phase tlag was calculated according to clagtlag presented in table 2 the results showed that an increasing initial k2feo4 concentration could shorten the lag phase and that the tlag of the m aeruginosa samples with high cell densities was longer than that for samples with lower cell densities the lysis rates of k2feo4 with the m aeruginosa cells cell density 1 105 cells ml 1 in the rytr water were in the range of 128 242 m 1 s 1 in the case of the 5 105 cells ml 1 m aeruginosa cultures the rates for 5 and 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 oxidation were 170 and 228 m 1 s 1 respectively 4 discussion two natural waters filtered ckl and rytr waters were applied as the background waters in this study in addition to asm 1 media tests were conducted to culture m aeruginosa cells in filtered ckl and rytr waters to evaluate whether there was osmotic shock and possible death of m aeruginosa cells the results showed that all of the cell membranes remained intact during 240 min of incubation fig 5 therefore the influence on the membrane integrity of m aeruginosa cells was determined to be negligible when transferring them from the asm 1 media to the natural waters there were apparently higher oxidant demands in the asm 1 media and ckl water than in the rytr water under equivalent conditions fig 1 this may be attributed to a higher npdoc concentration 8 32 mg l 1 in the ckl water than in the rytr water npdoc concentrations ranged from 1 59 to 1 75 mg l 1 table 1 this was consistent with the findings of previous studies demonstrating that larger amounts of noms increased the oxidant demands in algae laden water fan et al 2016 contrarily the npdoc concentration of the asm 1 media 2 02 mg l 1 was considerably lower than that of the ckl water however the oxidant demands were relatively the same for the cyanobacterial samples in these two waters one possible reason for this is that there may be strong self decomposition of k2feo4 caused by various ions existing in asm 1 media such as nitrate no 3 and cobalt ions co2 table s1 supplementary materials it has been documented that ions like no 3 and co2 can significantly increase the self decomposition rates of k2feo4 licht et al 1999 in addition it has been proven that k2feo4 can remove manganese mn2 efficiently goodwill et al 2016 hence soluble mn2 concentration of 0 37 mg l 1 in asm 1 media can also consume a certain amount of k2feo4 contributing to overall oxidant demands also as a form of organic matter ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta in asm 1 media may accelerate k2feo4 degradation therefore in order to understand which components play important roles in ferrate decomposition 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 decay experiments were conducted in asm 1 media and the media in the absence of no 3 co2 mn2 or edta fig 7 the results showed that the decay path of the asm 1 media the media without no 3 and the media without co2 were similar thus neither no 3 nor co2 were the main component inducing the decomposition of k2feo4 instead the degradation of k2feo4 in the media without mn2 or edta was considerably slower than that in the asm 1 media consequently mn2 and edta are the major factors that could interfere with k2feo4 oxidation generally the k2feo4 decay path between the control without m aeruginosa cells and the m aeruginosa samples were similar for those in the asm 1 media ckl and rytr waters this disagrees with most of previous studies in which it was observed that algal samples had higher oxidant consumption and faster decay rates than control samples in most cases coral et al 2013 although the results of oxidant consumption in the cyanobacterial samples were similar to those in the control samples the cyanobacterial cells and associated mcs still could be affected by k2feo4 figs 2 3 and 4 one possible reason for this is that cyanobacterial cells and their mcs may prioritize consumption of k2feo4 rather than the substances in background waters the impacts of popular oxidation processes e g chlorine kmno4 and ozone on cyanobacteria cell viability and associated toxins have been well studied in laboratory media and natural waters lin et al 2009 zamyadi et al 2013 fan et al 2014b it has been proven that these oxidants can efficiently compromise cyanobacteria cells in contrast this study showed that cyanobacteria in asm 1 media had a strong resistance to k2feo4 oxidation with all of the cells retaining their membrane integrity during 240 min of treatment fan et al 2014b compared various oxidants e g chlorine kmno4 ozone and h2o2 for cyanobacteria treatments in asm 1 media and wastewater which had larger amounts of doc 6 0 mg l 1 different from k2feo4 those oxidants reported in fan et al 2014b had a stronger ability in compromising the membrane integrity of cyanobacterial samples in asm 1 media as compared to in wastewater this discrepancy may be attributed to the fact that k2feo4 exhibited a rapid self decomposition in the asm 1 media fig 1a resulting in inadequate oxidant residuals to inactivate cyanobacterial cells similar to those in the asm 1 experiments the membrane integrity of the cyanobacterial cells in the ckl water remained fairly constant using the initial k2feo4 dose of 10 mg l 1 however a gradual decline in cell integrity was evident in the 20 mg l 1 k2feo4 treatment although the doc content of the ckl water may have suppressed the efficiency of k2feo4 in disrupting the cell integrity of m aeruginosa samples the reduced efficiency was considerably larger than that found for the other oxidants especially in the experimental systems with high doc concentrations and algal cell density for example daly et al 2007 found that within 30 min a dose of 12 mg l 1 chlorine could inactivate 99 9 of m aeruginosa cell density 3 105 cells ml 1 in myponga reservoir water doc 16 9 mg l in south australia this suggests that k2feo4 may have a different mode of activity in oxidizing cyanobacterial samples also the reduced efficiency observed in the current study could be attributed to differences in water quality parameters including alkalinity ph and nom character k2feo4 was shown to have the greatest impact on the viability of m aeruginosa cells in rytr water amongst all of the investigated waters in this study however a lag phase was observed before cell rupture for all m aeruginosa samples exposed to 3 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 the m aeruginosa sample cell density 5 105 cells ml 1 treated with 5 mg l 1 k2feo4 had the longest delay time 139 5 min this agrees with huo et al 2015 who documented that there was a lag phase in cell rupture when h2o2 was applied to treat m aeruginosa pcc 7820 the same strain used in the present study it is possible that the cell bound mucilage reacted with the oxidant and protected the cell membrane from oxidant attack huo et al 2015 fan et al 2016 in this study a delayed chick watson model was used to simulate the cell inactivation data however the majority of previous studies used a chick watson model since cell rupture generally occurred when oxidation started daly et al 2007 zamyadi et al 2013 fan et al 2014a this phenomenon could be attributed to different types of oxidants oxidant dosages and water matrix colony formation and the variations between cyanobacteria species lin et al 2009 fan et al 2016 therefore the water suppliers should choose the proper model to simulate data according to specific combinations of oxidants water matrices and cyanobacteria species in particular it should be noticed whether there is a lag phase existing before cyanobacterial cell rupture which has been neglected previously the cell lysis rates of the m aeruginosa samples in rytr water by k2feo4 treatments were determined to be 128 242 m 1 s 1 in this study a previous study also evaluated the cell lysis rates of m aeruginosa samples by chlorination in rytr water and the observed rate constant was 430 m 1 s 1 lin et al 2009 which was slightly higher than those in this study however the cell density of the m aeruginosa samples 1 6 104 cells ml 1 used by lin et al 2009 was considerably lower than that of the present study 1 0 105 cells ml 1 or 5 0 105 cells ml 1 therefore the efficiency of k2feo4 in compromising cyanobacterial cells is generally comparable to that of chlorine treatment which is recognized as an efficient oxidant fig 6 further indicates that ferrate vi can induce cyanobacterial cell damage although the membrane integrity was relatively unaffected n n0 0 95 and there was no leakage of intracellular mcs after 10 mg l 1 k2feo4 oxidation for 30 min fig 4c a visible alteration in the cell morphology has been observed by sem at that time fig 6b this suggested that the cyanobacterial cells were unhealthy after ferrate oxidation for 30 min however there might be a delay for the occurrence of membrane damage and mc release the cyanobacterial cells became deflated and shrank to a smaller size after a longer contact time fig 6c e which indicated that the cells were further compromised by the k2feo4 treatment considering together the results from the sem photos fig 6 and the cell integrity and mc concentrations fig 4 sem may provide a visual indication of cell morphology and however cell integrity and mc release is difficult to be directly reflected from the photos as the damage may be too small to be visible the decomposed products of ferrate vi ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 colloids were observed on the cell surface fig 6 which could facilitate conglomeration of algal cells and enhance the subsequent coagulation process ma and liu 2002 zhou et al 2014 it has been demonstrated that k2feo4 could effectively degrade spiked toxins in ultrapure and natural waters jiang et al 2014 few studies have evaluated the fates of cyanotoxins in the presence of cyanobacterial cells using k2feo4 as an oxidant this study showed that k2feo4 could remove both of the intracellular and extracellular mcs from cyanobacterial cells in asm 1 media and ckl water with their membranes relatively unaffected this finding agrees with studies by fan et al 2014b who indicated that kmno4 3 mg l 1 could oxidize intracellular mcs effectively with the cyanobacterial cell membrane remaining intact one possibility for this is that the cyanobacterial cells are stressed unhealthy after oxidation though they are still intact thus they may release more toxins to protect themselves alternatively the self decomposition of k2feo4 may produce reactive oxygen species ros and h2o2 sharma et al 2015 which may enter into cells and oxidize intracellular mcs in addition it is possible that algae could form intracellular ros as a response to environmental stress for instance a previous study has reported that production of intracellular ros in algal cells was observed after the addition of 50 250 nm copper knauert and knauer 2008 in the case of the samples in rytr water k2feo4 also showed a strong ability to oxidize mcs even for samples with high cell density and high concentrations of mcs the total mc level was reduced by 95 fig 4e the investigations in this study were laboratory based and this should be taken into account when assessing the efficiency and risks of full scale treatment in wtps in addition water parameters such as doc and possible metals could significantly reduce the amount of k2feo4 available to act upon cyanobacterial cells thus these interferences need to be considered when determining dose levels under real situations 5 conclusions the results of this study indicated that k2feo4 could inactivate m aeruginosa cells to varying degrees in natural waters but the efficiency could be significantly reduced by noms the cells retained membrane integrity in the asm 1 media probably due to the self decomposition of k2feo4 caused by the presence of mn2 and organic matter edta in the media therefore depending on the water matrix in drinking water treatment processes k2feo4 could be applied as a post oxidant to inactivate cyanobacterial cells or as a pre oxidant without affecting cyanobacterial cell integrity it was shown that k2feo4 was able to oxidize the released mcs rapidly and no increase of extracellular mcs was observed under the majority of experimental conditions although pilot field studies in water treatment plants are needed to evaluate the dosage point of application influence of a water matrix and impact on coagulation sedimentation processes k2feo4 can be considered as a potential oxidant for cyanobacteria and their associated toxin treatment in drinking water treatment processes acknowledgements this research is supported by taiwan ministry of science and technology number most 104 2221 e 006 021 my3

15 min in addition to these commercially available qcm sensors sio2 sensor coated with a layer of positively charged poly l lysine pll was prepared following the procedure published elsewhere li et al 2014 specific qcm sensors were mounted in the flow modules and placed into the measuring chamber the measuring chamber was held constant at room temperature 22 c for all measurements a peristaltic pump was used to deliver the nom solution 1 50 mg c l to the sensor surface at a constant flow rate 20 μl min armanious et al 2014 louie et al 2015 the deposition of nom onto the qcm sensors result in a continuous shift in frequency f as described by the sauerbrey relationship sauerbrey 1959 1 δ m c n δ f n where n is the overtone number 1 3 5 7 9 etc δ f n is the frequency shift at each overtone n and c is the crystal constant 17 7 hz 1 cm 2 the nom deposition process on the crystal surface will also enhance the crystal s ability to dissipate energy as shown in the increase in the energy dissipation d via the following equation 2 d e d i s s i p a t e d 2 π e s t o r e d where e d i s s i p a t e d is the energy loss in each oscillation cycle and e s t o r e d is the total energy stored in the oscillator since the mass deposited is linearly related to the frequency shift when dissipation is small the nom deposition rate can be calculated from the initial slope of frequency change the change of normalized frequency at the fifth overtone in the initial deposition period t was used to quantify the deposition rate r d chen and elimelech 2006 3 r d d δ f 5 d t frequency and dissipation data were further modeled by commercial software q tools q sense goeteborg sweden to obtain quantitative information on the adlayer mass and viscoelastic properties for the voigt model bulk density bulk viscosity and adlayer density were set as 1 0 g cm 3 0 001 pa s and 1 05 g cm 3 respectively armanious et al 2014 yan et al 2012 for concentration dependent studies the langmuir isotherm for nom adsorption at the solid liquid interface can be expressed as equation 4 chi and amy 2004 eita 2011b gu et al 1995 lofrano et al 2016 tipping 1981 tombácz et al 2000 yang et al 2009 4 c e q e c e q m 1 q m k l where c e is the equilibrium concentration of nom in the injected solution ng cm 3 q e is the adsorption density at equilibrium in ng cm 2 q m is the maximum adsorption density in ng cm 2 and k l is the langmuir equilibrium constant a linear regression of c e q e against c e gives a straight line with a slope of 1 q m and y intercept of 1 q m k l 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of srha concentration on nom deposition concentration dependent nom deposition studies were conducted for three types of qcm sensors sio2 al2o3 and ps representing negatively charged hydrophilic positively charged hydrophilic and hydrophobic environmental surfaces at neutral ph condition respectively for varied concentrations of srha the representative normalized frequency shifts at the fifth overtone for srha deposition onto the sio2 coated qcm sensor surfaces are plotted as a function of time at ph of 7 0 as shown in fig s1 here the baseline was initially stabilized with 5 mm nacl buffer for 10 min followed by the injection of varying concentrations of srha in buffer solution deposition processes were allowed to proceed for 30 min before the injected solution was switched back to buffer solution initiating the release process discussed further below for all srha concentrations evaluated 1 50 mg c l only frequency shifts of zero negligible were observed on sio2 sensors meaning that the amount of srha deposited onto sio2 was below the detection limit of our system at neutral ph conditions electrostatic repulsion force inhibits negatively charged srha from depositing onto the negatively charged sio2 coated sensor surface yang et al 2009 the deposition behaviors of srha onto al2o3 and ps sensor surfaces were similarly examined and in contrast to the sio2 surface deposition readily occurred for the al2o3 and ps surfaces fig 1 for all srha concentrations a sharp frequency decrease and fast surface saturation equilibrium on the al2o3 surface were observed even with srha concentration as low as 1 mg c l for all final absolute frequency shifts were in the range of 5 6 6 5 hz 99 1 115 1 ng cm2 such relatively fast deposition rates and rapid saturation times 1 10 min suggest strong interactions between srha molecule and the al2o3 surface yan et al 2011 srha deposition onto ps coated surface is different from both sio2 and al2o3 coated qcm sensor surfaces deposition of srha on ps sensor surfaces is detectable at a concentration of 1 mg c l and becomes more pronounced as srha concentration further increased fig 1c the final deposition frequency shifts on ps were between 0 1 and 2 4 hz 1 8 42 5 ng cm2 for all cases the deposition of srha onto al2o3 and ps coated qcm sensor surfaces shows relatively low dissipation shift s fig 1b d further associated dissipation changes which correlate to the viscoelastic properties of the adsorbed layer li et al 2014 are relatively low indicating that srha adlayers on both al2o3 and ps surfaces are rigid when the adlayer is uniform and rigid the change in frequency shift is linearly related to the deposited mass according to the sauerbrey equation sauerbrey 1959 however for a soft adlayer with high viscoelasticity the mass is not directly proportional to the frequency change the voigt based viscoelastic model has been used to obtain more accurate adsorbed mass values by fitting both frequency shift and energy dissipation over multiple overtones yan et al 2011 the adsorbed mass of srha on al2o3 and ps coated qcm sensor surfaces are summarized in table 1 the voigt mass values of srha deposition are in excellent agreement with the sauerbrey mass values indicating sauerbrey equation can be sufficiently used to estimate the adlayer mass when the dissipation is relatively low armanious et al 2014 fig s2 depicts adsorbed srha mass and deposition rate as a function of srha concentration using the sauerbrey equation adsorbed srha mass on al2o3 is calculated as 99 101 104 107 and 114 ng cm2 for srha concentrations of 1 5 10 20 and 50 mg c l respectively for deposition on ps surface the adlayer mass is 2 9 13 25 and 44 ng cm2 for srha concentrations of 1 5 10 20 and 50 mg c l respectively deposition of srha on al2o3 reaches saturation at a concentration above 1 mg c l while the deposition of srha on ps increases linearly as a function of concentration albeit at lower coverage rate 50 monolayer coverage at 50 mg c l of srha srha is negatively charged from ph 5 9 and al2o3 is positively charged at ph 7 0 isoelectric point at ph 9 5 sui et al 2016 the adsorbed negatively charged srha neutralized the positive charge of al2o3 and further deposition reverses the effective surface charge therefore electrostatic repulsion force arises between already adsorbed srha and remaining deprotonated srha molecules in the solution phase preventing excess srha deposition and thus a saturated monolayer deposition of srha on al2o3 armanious et al 2014 deposition of srha onto ps coated qcm sensors is mainly attributed to hydrophobic interaction forces avena and koopal 1999 and the deposition rate is relatively slow compared to that on al2o3 surfaces as the hydrophilic groups e g carboxylic and phenolic groups are on the outer surface of the srha molecule while the hydrophobic portions are less sterically available partial structural rearrangement availability is likely required for favorable deposition to occur on ps sensor surfaces avena and koopal 1999 consequently changes in the conformation of srha during the deposition onto hydrophobic ps surface may affect the further adsorption of macromolecules microbes or biocides also as illustrated in fig s2b the deposition rates increase linearly as a function of srha concentration on both al2o3 and ps coated qcm sensor surfaces the adsorption isotherms of srha onto al2o3 and ps coated qcm sensor surfaces fit a langmuir model fig s3 which has also been observed in other studies chi and amy 2004 eita 2011b gu et al 1995 lofrano et al 2016 tipping 1981 tombácz et al 2000 yang et al 2009 from linear fits the values of the equilibrium constant k l are obtained as 1 39e 3 and 2 16e 5 cm3 ng 1 for deposition onto al2o3 and ps respectively 3 2 effect of ph nom type and collector surface on nom deposition nom deposition was further investigated as a function of ph nom type srha and srfa and collector surface fig s4 shows typical deposition behavior of srha srfa 20 mg c l onto sio2 and al2o3 coated qcm sensor surfaces at ph 5 ph 7 and ph 9 no frequency shift or negligible frequency shift of srha srfa on sio2 sensor surfaces was observed from ph 5 to ph 9 indicating weak interactions between nom and sio2 surfaces in contrast the deposition of nom on al2o3 coated qcm sensor surface is highly dependent on nom type and ph fig 2 and fig s5 summarize nom deposition mass and rates on al2o3 ps fe3o4 and hap coated qcm sensor surfaces respectively in general nom deposition on al2o3 and hap exhibit higher adlayer mass es compared to deposition on fe3o4 and ps collector surfaces under the same conditions based on the qcm d experiments srha srfa exhibited the highest mass adsorption on the al2o3 surface at a ph of 5 which is close to the optimal ph range of 5 5 6 5 for alum coagulation processes matilainen et al 2010 in addition based on high sorption capacities for nom hap may have application in water treatment processes for the removal of nom shi et al 2016 wei et al 2015 due to higher molecular weight and larger size qin et al 2015 ruohomäki et al 1998 weng et al 2007 srha displays higher deposited mass than srfa regardless of collector surface and ph such phenomenon has also been documented for the adsorption of ha and fa to other minerals such as goethite weng et al 2006 the deposition rate of nom shows a similar trend as that for the adsorbed mass whereby the highest deposition rates were observed on the surface of al2o3 and hap while the deposition rates on the surface of fe3o4 and ps were relatively slower ph dependence of nom deposition has been observed in previous studies matilainen et al 2010 yang et al 2009 which was attributed partially to varied electrostatic interactions arising from the changes in surface charge at different ph values for deposition onto hydrophobic ps surfaces an increase in ph leads to a corresponding increase of charged functional groups e g carboxylic acids at the periphery of the nom molecules preventing the further interactions between the hydrophobic groups and ps surfaces accordingly we observe an overall decrease in deposited mass and deposition rate fig s6 compares the d f ratios during the nom deposition the two densely dotted areas for each plot are referred to the baseline establishment and the rinsing process before and after the deposition step respectively the approximate linearly increase in association corresponds to deposition processes the relatively small increase of dissipation accompanied by the frequency drop indicates the rigidity of formed adlayer regardless of the coverage extension the d f ratios are nearly identical regardless of ph nom type and collector surfaces indicating the viscoelastic properties of the adsorbed layer are very similar favorable deposition conditions were also conducted by precoating the sio2 coated qcm sensor surface with a net positively charged layer of poly l lysine pll favorable deposition experiments were performed on positively charged pll surfaces using 20 mg c l of srha srfa at ph 7 fig 3 represents the normalized frequency change at the fifth overtone for srha srfa deposition onto pll coated qcm sensor surface at ph 7 nom deposition experiments show higher mass deposition on pll surfaces compared to that for al2o3 coated sensor surfaces a previous study suggests the tails and loops of pll polymer can also enhance the adsorption of both small and large molecules armanious et al 2014 examination of the corresponding d f ratios fig s7 shows the adlayer formed on al2o3 is slightly more rigid than for the pll surface water associated with within pll molecules layers may also contribute to increased energy dissipation i e viscoelasticity 3 3 deposited layer stability subsequent nom release from sensor surfaces was also examined to evaluate deposited layer stability for each deposition experiment the inlet solution was switched to a buffer solution 5 mm nacl after nom deposition to initiate release process as shown in fig 4 the adlayer stability at ph 7 follows the order of pll al2o3 hap ps fe3o4 only 7 of deposited mass was released from the al2o3 sensor surface indicating the deposition was relatively stable under these conditions due to the strong interactions between srha srfa and al2o3 adlayers were least stable on fe3o4 and ps surfaces 3 4 effect of srha molecular weight on deposition the effect of srha molecular weight on srha deposition on al2o3 and ps coated qcm sensor surface is shown in fig 5 in order to fractionate srha with different molecular weights ultrafiltration membranes with nominal molecular weight cut offs of 100 kda and 10 kda were employed srha with a higher molecular weight results in larger frequency shift irrespective of collector type calculated adlayer masses on al2o3 are 152 95 and 68 ng cm2 for fractionated srha with molecular weights of 100 kda 10 100 kda and 10 kda respectively fractionated srha deposition on ps surface behaves similarly higher molecular weight s srha exhibits preferential adsorption compared to smaller molecular srha weights davis and gloor 1981 gu et al 1995 davis gu and armanious et al noted that nom with higher molecular weight shows greater affinity to the alumina surface compared to the compound with lower molecular weight armanious et al 2014 chi and amy 2004 davis and gloor 1981 gu et al 1995 the preferential adsorption of fractionated srha onto al2o3 agrees with previous coagulation studies showing that higher molecular weight nom fractions are removed more efficiently than the lower molecular weight fractions matilainen et al 2010 yan et al 2006 the d f ratios are almost the same regardless of srha molecular weight on both al2o3 and ps surfaces indicating the structure and viscoelastic properties of these layers are similar 3 5 effect of ca2 mg2 on nom deposition fig 6 shows the representative frequency shifts at the fifth overtone for nom deposition onto al2o3 in the presence of ca2 and mg2 the addition of divalent cations results in a pronounced change in the frequency shifts especially under high ionic strengths regardless of nom type deposited mass increases with increasing ionic strength increased divalent cation concentration further neutralizes the surface charge of nom decreasing the electrostatic repulsion between nom molecules resulting in a higher final adlayer mass chi and amy 2004 vermeer et al 1998 weng et al 2006 plots of dissipation against frequency for nom deposition in the presence of 0 5 and 5 0 mm ca2 mg2 on al2o3 are shown in figs s8 and s9 high d f corresponds to a soft er layer with higher viscoelastic properties while low d f ratio indicates a rigid and compact adlayer structure further the deposition of srha srfa onto the al2o3 results in three distinct structures features regimes in the presence of divalent cations srha srfa deposition in 0 5 mm ca2 mg2 srfa deposition in 5 0 mm mg2 and srha deposition in 5 0 mm ca2 each regime has distinguishing features for deposited mass deposition rate and viscoelasticity the first type srha srfa in 0 5 mm ca2 mg2 shows low deposited mass fast saturation and high rigidity indicating an adsorbed layer with little difference from a monolayer formation as previously discussed the second type srfa in 5 0 mm mg2 exhibits more deposited mass medium saturation rate and increased viscoelasticity the last type srha in 5 0 mm ca2 shows much higher deposition mass no saturation over times evaluated and quite different viscoelastic characteristics demonstrating that the deposited layer is relatively soft interestingly while we find that d f ratios are similar for srha srfa deposition when the added ca2 mg2 concentration is low 0 5 mm in the presence of 5 mm ca2 d f ratio for srha deposition is much higher than that for the srfa deposition both show a similar d f slope in the presence of 5 mm mg2 this suggests that the physical conformation of the srha layer formed in the presence of higher ca2 is fundamentally different from the other layers observed divalent ca2 can act as both cation bridge and charge neutralizer to promote the interactions between srha in the solution and those already adsorbed chi and amy 2004 weng et al 2006 adlayer structure s on ps surfaces exhibits similar trends fig s10 4 conclusion this work provides insightful quantitative and structural information at a molecular scale on the interfacial interactions between nom and model environmental surfaces concentration dependent studies show that the deposition of srha onto al2o3 and ps collector surface follows langmuir type model deposition rate and mass of the nom adlayer are a function of nom concentration type fraction ph and collector surface type favorable deposition of nom was observed on the surface of al2o3 hap and pll but not on sio2 based on the results hap with high adsorption capacity could also serve as a potential adsorbent for nom removal in water treatment further the presence of divalent cations ca2 mg2 significantly promotes adlayer mass deposited onto the surfaces of al2o3 sio2 and ps in the presence of 5 0 mm ca2 structural conformation of srha adlayer was observed to be fundamentally different than all other adlayers in that it is relatively less dense and softer taken together this work highlights the complicated dynamics of interfacial nom deposition processes onto environmental surfaces which have direct implications regarding fundamental nom behavior including potential nom facilitated transport of contaminants colloids bio macromolecules and even microbes among other processes associated content supporting information

isotherm for nom adsorption at the solid liquid interface can be expressed as equation 4 chi and amy 2004 eita 2011b gu et al 1995 lofrano et al 2016 tipping 1981 tombácz et al 2000 yang et al 2009 4

discussion 3 1 effect of srha concentration on nom deposition concentration dependent nom deposition studies were conducted for three types of qcm sensors sio2 al2o3 and ps representing negatively charged hydrophilic positively charged hydrophilic and hydrophobic environmental surfaces at neutral ph condition respectively for varied concentrations of srha the representative normalized frequency shifts at the fifth overtone for srha deposition onto the sio2 coated qcm sensor surfaces are plotted as a function of time at ph of 7 0 as shown in fig s1 here the baseline was initially stabilized with 5 mm nacl buffer for 10 min followed by the injection of varying concentrations of srha in buffer solution deposition processes were allowed to proceed for 30 min before the injected solution was switched back to buffer solution initiating the release process discussed further below for all srha concentrations evaluated 1 50 mg c l only frequency shifts of zero negligible were observed on sio2 sensors meaning that the amount of srha deposited onto sio2 was below the detection limit of our system at neutral ph conditions electrostatic repulsion force inhibits negatively charged srha from depositing onto the negatively charged sio2 coated sensor surface yang et al 2009 the deposition behaviors of srha onto al2o3 and ps sensor surfaces were similarly examined and in contrast to the sio2 surface deposition readily occurred for the al2o3 and ps surfaces fig 1 for all srha concentrations a sharp frequency decrease and fast surface saturation equilibrium on the al2o3 surface were observed even with srha concentration as low as 1 mg c l for all final absolute frequency shifts were in the range of 5 6 6 5 hz 99 1 115 1 ng cm2 such relatively fast deposition rates and rapid saturation times 1 10 min suggest strong interactions between srha molecule and the al2o3 surface yan et al 2011 srha deposition onto ps coated surface is different from both sio2 and al2o3 coated qcm sensor surfaces deposition of srha on ps sensor surfaces is detectable at a concentration of 1 mg c l and becomes more pronounced as srha concentration further increased fig 1c the final deposition frequency shifts on ps were between 0 1 and 2 4 hz 1 8 42 5 ng cm2 for all cases the deposition of srha onto al2o3 and ps coated qcm sensor surfaces shows relatively low dissipation shift s fig 1b d further associated dissipation changes which correlate to the viscoelastic properties of the adsorbed layer li et al 2014 are relatively low indicating that srha adlayers on both al2o3 and ps surfaces are rigid when the adlayer is uniform and rigid the change in frequency shift is linearly related to the deposited mass according to the sauerbrey equation sauerbrey 1959 however for a soft adlayer with high viscoelasticity the mass is not directly proportional to the frequency change the voigt based viscoelastic model has been used to obtain more accurate adsorbed mass values by fitting both frequency shift and energy dissipation over multiple overtones yan et al 2011 the adsorbed mass of srha on al2o3 and ps coated qcm sensor surfaces are summarized in table 1 the voigt mass values of srha deposition are in excellent agreement with the sauerbrey mass values indicating sauerbrey equation can be sufficiently used to estimate the adlayer mass when the dissipation is relatively low armanious et al 2014 fig s2 depicts adsorbed srha mass and deposition rate as a function of srha concentration using the sauerbrey equation adsorbed srha mass on al2o3 is calculated as 99 101 104 107 and 114 ng cm2 for srha concentrations of 1 5 10 20 and 50 mg c l respectively for deposition on ps surface the adlayer mass is 2 9 13 25 and 44 ng cm2 for srha concentrations of 1 5 10 20 and 50 mg c l respectively deposition of srha on al2o3 reaches saturation at a concentration above 1 mg c l while the deposition of srha on ps increases linearly as a function of concentration albeit at lower coverage rate 50 monolayer coverage at 50 mg c l of srha srha is negatively charged from ph 5 9 and al2o3 is positively charged at ph 7 0 isoelectric point at ph 9 5 sui et al 2016 the adsorbed negatively charged srha neutralized the positive charge of al2o3 and further deposition reverses the effective surface charge therefore electrostatic repulsion force arises between already adsorbed srha and remaining deprotonated srha molecules in the solution phase preventing excess srha deposition and thus a saturated monolayer deposition of srha on al2o3 armanious et al 2014 deposition of srha onto ps coated qcm sensors is mainly attributed to hydrophobic interaction forces avena and koopal 1999 and the deposition rate is relatively slow compared to that on al2o3 surfaces as the hydrophilic groups e g carboxylic and phenolic groups are on the outer surface of the srha molecule while the hydrophobic portions are less sterically available partial structural rearrangement availability is likely required for favorable deposition to occur on ps sensor surfaces avena and koopal 1999 consequently changes in the conformation of srha during the deposition onto hydrophobic ps surface may affect the further adsorption of macromolecules microbes or biocides also as illustrated in fig s2b the deposition rates increase linearly as a function of srha concentration on both al2o3 and ps coated qcm sensor surfaces the adsorption isotherms of srha onto al2o3 and ps coated qcm sensor surfaces fit a langmuir model fig s3 which has also been observed in other studies chi and amy 2004 eita 2011b gu et al 1995 lofrano et al 2016 tipping 1981 tombácz et al 2000 yang et al 2009 from linear fits the values of the equilibrium constant k l are obtained as 1 39e 3 and 2 16e 5 cm3 ng 1 for deposition onto al2o3 and ps respectively 3 2 effect of ph nom type and collector surface on nom deposition nom deposition was further investigated as a function of ph nom type srha and srfa and collector surface fig s4 shows typical deposition behavior of srha srfa 20 mg c l onto sio2 and al2o3 coated qcm sensor surfaces at ph 5 ph 7 and ph 9 no frequency shift or negligible frequency shift of srha srfa on sio2 sensor surfaces was observed from ph 5 to ph 9 indicating weak interactions between nom and sio2 surfaces in contrast the deposition of nom on al2o3 coated qcm sensor surface is highly dependent on nom type and ph fig 2 and fig s5 summarize nom deposition mass and rates on al2o3 ps fe3o4 and hap coated qcm sensor surfaces respectively in general nom deposition on al2o3 and hap exhibit higher adlayer mass es compared to deposition on fe3o4 and ps collector surfaces under the same conditions based on the qcm d experiments srha srfa exhibited the highest mass adsorption on the al2o3 surface at a ph of 5 which is close to the optimal ph range of 5 5 6 5 for alum coagulation processes matilainen et al 2010 in addition based on high sorption capacities for nom hap may have application in water treatment processes for the removal of nom shi et al 2016 wei et al 2015 due to higher molecular weight and larger size qin et al 2015 ruohomäki et al 1998 weng et al 2007 srha displays higher deposited mass than srfa regardless of collector surface and ph such phenomenon has also been documented for the adsorption of ha and fa to other minerals such as goethite weng et al 2006 the deposition rate of nom shows a similar trend as that for the adsorbed mass whereby the highest deposition rates were observed on the surface of al2o3 and hap while the deposition rates on the surface of fe3o4 and ps were relatively slower ph dependence of nom deposition has been observed in previous studies matilainen et al 2010 yang et al 2009 which was attributed partially to varied electrostatic interactions arising from the changes in surface charge at different ph values for deposition onto hydrophobic ps surfaces an increase in ph leads to a corresponding increase of charged functional groups e g carboxylic acids at the periphery of the nom molecules preventing the further interactions between the hydrophobic groups and ps surfaces accordingly we observe an overall decrease in deposited mass and deposition rate fig s6 compares the d f ratios during the nom deposition the two densely dotted areas for each plot are referred to the baseline establishment and the rinsing process before and after the deposition step respectively the approximate linearly increase in association corresponds to deposition processes the relatively small increase of dissipation accompanied by the frequency drop indicates the rigidity of formed adlayer regardless of the coverage extension the d f ratios are nearly identical regardless of ph nom type and collector surfaces indicating the viscoelastic properties of the adsorbed layer are very similar favorable deposition conditions were also conducted by precoating the sio2 coated qcm sensor surface with a net positively charged layer of poly l lysine pll favorable deposition experiments were performed on positively charged pll surfaces using 20 mg c l of srha srfa at ph 7 fig 3 represents the normalized frequency change at the fifth overtone for srha srfa deposition onto pll coated qcm sensor surface at ph 7 nom deposition experiments show higher mass deposition on pll surfaces compared to that for al2o3 coated sensor surfaces a previous study suggests the tails and loops of pll polymer can also enhance the adsorption of both small and large molecules armanious et al 2014 examination of the corresponding d f ratios fig s7 shows the adlayer formed on al2o3 is slightly more rigid than for the pll surface water associated with within pll molecules layers may also contribute to increased energy dissipation i e viscoelasticity 3 3 deposited layer stability subsequent nom release from sensor surfaces was also examined to evaluate deposited layer stability for each deposition experiment the inlet solution was switched to a buffer solution 5 mm nacl after nom deposition to initiate release process as shown in fig 4 the adlayer stability at ph 7 follows the order of pll al2o3 hap ps fe3o4 only 7 of deposited mass was released from the al2o3 sensor surface indicating the deposition was relatively stable under these conditions due to the strong interactions between srha srfa and al2o3 adlayers were least stable on fe3o4 and ps surfaces 3 4 effect of srha molecular weight on deposition the effect of srha molecular weight on srha deposition on al2o3 and ps coated qcm sensor surface is shown in fig 5 in order to fractionate srha with different molecular weights ultrafiltration membranes with nominal molecular weight cut offs of 100 kda and 10 kda were employed srha with a higher molecular weight results in larger frequency shift irrespective of collector type calculated adlayer masses on al2o3 are 152 95 and 68 ng cm2 for fractionated srha with molecular weights of 100 kda 10 100 kda and 10 kda respectively fractionated srha deposition on ps surface behaves similarly higher molecular weight s srha exhibits preferential adsorption compared to smaller molecular srha weights davis and gloor 1981 gu et al 1995 davis gu and armanious et al noted that nom with higher molecular weight shows greater affinity to the alumina surface compared to the compound with lower molecular weight armanious et al 2014 chi and amy 2004 davis and gloor 1981 gu et al 1995 the preferential adsorption of fractionated srha onto al2o3 agrees with previous coagulation studies showing that higher molecular weight nom fractions are removed more efficiently than the lower molecular weight fractions matilainen et al 2010 yan et al 2006 the d f ratios are almost the same regardless of srha molecular weight on both al2o3 and ps surfaces indicating the structure and viscoelastic properties of these layers are similar 3 5 effect of ca2 mg2 on nom deposition fig 6 shows the representative frequency shifts at the fifth overtone for nom deposition onto al2o3 in the presence of ca2 and mg2 the addition of divalent cations results in a pronounced change in the frequency shifts especially under high ionic strengths regardless of nom type deposited mass increases with increasing ionic strength increased divalent cation concentration further neutralizes the surface charge of nom decreasing the electrostatic repulsion between nom molecules resulting in a higher final adlayer mass chi and amy 2004 vermeer et al 1998 weng et al 2006 plots of dissipation against frequency for nom deposition in the presence of 0 5 and 5 0 mm ca2 mg2 on al2o3 are shown in figs s8 and s9 high d f corresponds to a soft er layer with higher viscoelastic properties while low d f ratio indicates a rigid and compact adlayer structure further the deposition of srha srfa onto the al2o3 results in three distinct structures features regimes in the presence of divalent cations srha srfa deposition in 0 5 mm ca2 mg2 srfa deposition in 5 0 mm mg2 and srha deposition in 5 0 mm ca2 each regime has distinguishing features for deposited mass deposition rate and viscoelasticity the first type srha srfa in 0 5 mm ca2 mg2 shows low deposited mass fast saturation and high rigidity indicating an adsorbed layer with little difference from a monolayer formation as previously discussed the second type srfa in 5 0 mm mg2 exhibits more deposited mass medium saturation rate and increased viscoelasticity the last type srha in 5 0 mm ca2 shows much higher deposition mass no saturation over times evaluated and quite different viscoelastic characteristics demonstrating that the deposited layer is relatively soft interestingly while we find that d f ratios are similar for srha srfa deposition when the added ca2 mg2 concentration is low 0 5 mm in the presence of 5 mm ca2 d f ratio for srha deposition is much higher than that for the srfa deposition both show a similar d f slope in the presence of 5 mm mg2 this suggests that the physical conformation of the srha layer formed in the presence of higher ca2 is fundamentally different from the other layers observed divalent ca2 can act as both cation bridge and charge neutralizer to promote the interactions between srha in the solution and those already adsorbed chi and amy 2004 weng et al 2006 adlayer structure s on ps surfaces exhibits similar trends fig s10 4 conclusion this work provides insightful quantitative and structural information at a molecular scale on the interfacial interactions between nom and model environmental surfaces concentration dependent studies show that the deposition of srha onto al2o3 and ps collector surface follows langmuir type model deposition rate and mass of the nom adlayer are a function of nom concentration type fraction ph and collector surface type favorable deposition of nom was observed on the surface of al2o3 hap and pll but not on sio2 based on the results hap with high adsorption capacity could also serve as a potential adsorbent for nom removal in water treatment further the presence of divalent cations ca2 mg2 significantly promotes adlayer mass deposited onto the surfaces of al2o3 sio2 and ps in the presence of 5 0 mm ca2 structural conformation of srha adlayer was observed to be fundamentally different than all other adlayers in that it is relatively less dense and softer taken together this work highlights the complicated dynamics of interfacial nom deposition processes onto environmental surfaces which have direct implications regarding fundamental nom behavior including potential nom facilitated transport of contaminants colloids bio macromolecules and even microbes among other processes associated content supporting information
