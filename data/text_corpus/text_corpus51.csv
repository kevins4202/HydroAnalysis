255,until recently wave and hydrodynamic properties in the cross shore direction have been linked to accretive or erosive morphological evolution however various uncertainties remain hindering the full understanding and accurate prediction of the transport direction and quantity of sediment transport in nearshore areas in this study we showed that flash rip currents frcs could significantly amplify suspended sediment flushing out of the surf zone by greatly increasing advective flux even under accretive wave conditions in a depth integrated modeling framework compared to the case without frcs where only one dimensional cross shore direction waves and currents exist frc driven seaward advective sediment flux increased by approximately o 102 times under normal incoming waves on alongshore uniform beaches at least for the tested wave and bathymetry conditions to properly consider the role of frcs in suspended sediment flushing short wave related physics such as nonhydrostatic pressure and frequency dispersion had to be included in addition it was important to accurately predict not only wave properties but also local hydrodynamics that cause erosion and advection finally uniform sandbars prevented beach erosion even when frcs occurred on uniform beaches by dissipating the wave energy closely associated with frc generation therefore one dimensional cross shore direction approaches neglecting the role of frc driven sediment transport processes which are closely related to short wave motions and occur in two dimensional space could lead to lower prediction accuracy keywords flash rip current suspended sediment transport depth integrated model numerical model non hydrostatic pressure 1 introduction the fate of sediments in nearshore areas is one of the major research concerns in coastal science and engineering communities because it can significantly affect the morphology ecology and human activities in these areas deigaard 1992 jing and ridd 1997 dean and dalrymple 2001 generally sediment transport is split into alongshore and cross shore transport although cross shore sediment flux is much smaller than alongshore sediment flux cross shore sediment transport plays a vital role in beach profile evolution and the profile strongly affects alongshore currents and transport grasso et al 2009 many tools have been developed to predict sediment transport and morphological change some based on simple parameters and others on complex physical processes determining the quantity of cross shore sediment flux is a crucial factor among several for accurate prediction some of the most widely used methods energetic approaches bagnold 1966 are based on the steady flow concept statistical properties such as wave asymmetry velocity skewness and acceleration skewness have been found to be closely related to onshore and offshore sediment transport and have been used to improve the performance of models bailard 1981 hoefel and elgar 2003 grasso et al 2011 since these sediment transport models are based on statistical properties effects of wave resolving processes like flash rip current frc on sediment transport can be neglected in the statistical approaches thus if there are important sediment transport mechanisms depending on wave resolving processes we need to find them out to improve the sediment transport prediction accuracy for example murray et al 2003 observed a coastal flow and sediment transport event at torrey pines beach california us during a storm event in the view of time average no rip current occurred near the field site however a rip current did occur there and associate sediment plume was observed murray et al 2003 therefore it will be difficult to accurately predict these rip current driven sediment transport processes with statistical approaches more recently in addition to statistical wave characteristics bathymetrically driven rip currents have been highlighted as a major mechanism for rip channel development yu and slinn 2003 murray 2004 castelle et al 2010 bathymetrically driven rip currents occur at fixed alongshore locations or along rip channels and are a component of the mean circulation macmahan et al 2006 dalrymple et al 2011 rip currents are narrow and intense nearshore flows in the seaward direction generated in the surf zone consequently they can transport materials in cross shore directions reniers et al 2010 dalrymple et al 2011 castelle and coco 2013 and kumar and feddersen 2017 showed that rip currents can effectively flush passive scalars from the surf zone to the inner shelf talbot and bate 1987 macmahan et al 2005 and thorpe et al 2013 conducted real world field studies to investigate the relationship between bathymetrically driven rip currents and associated sediment transport another type of rip currents one that is not bathymetrically driven and is known as a transient rip current or frc is occasionally observed on open coast beaches the characteristics of frcs that occur on uniform beaches and last for o 10 min and then decay are spatially and temporally variable unlike those of bathymetrically driven rip currents which are accompanied by rip channels johnson and pattiaratchi 2006 unlike bathymetrically driven rip current frc is surf zone eddies generated by finite crest length wave breaking and coalesce of the eddies johnson and pattiaratchi 2006 hally rosendahl and feddersen 2016 understanding frc driven sediment transport is important because frcs occurred frequently in surf zones a real world passive tracer field experiment was conducted to evaluate frc driven exchange hally rosendahl et al 2014 although however passive tracers can effectively show the pathways of tracer particles the density of passive scalars is different from the density of sediment in the real world which can lead to different transport results between the passive and active tracers in addition their spatiotemporal transient nature makes it difficult to measure frc driven sediment transport in the real world although numerical approaches also have limitations such as numerical errors and limited physical processes they can be used for sediment transport studies as an alternative to analytical and observational approaches many morphodynamic models have been developed and applied to various coastal areas for example van ormondt et al 2020 recently developed a process based numerical model composed of delft3d lesser et al 2004 and xbeach roelvink et al 2010 to capture the hydrodynamics responsible for breach evolution during a storm event where the delft3d model was coupled with the swan spectral wave model booij et al 1999 to consider the short wave effects huynh et al 2017 developed a morphodynamic model coupled with a nonlinear shallow water equation model and sediment transport model applicable to long and non breaking wave environments harter and figlus 2017 simulated the morphological changes of an island during a hurricane event using the shallow water equation based version of the xbeach model coupled with a depth averaged sediment transport model bertin et al 2009 developed the morsys2d modeling system by integrating the hydrostatic flow model elcirc zhang and baptista 2004 swan and the sand2d morphology model fortunato 2007 the hydrodynamic model considered short wave effects by including the wave radiation stress longuet higgins and stewart 1960 in the momentum equations although various others including the above mentioned numerical models and applications have been reported most of the numerical modelings for wave induced nearshore circulations have been based on short wave period averaged mass and momentum conservation laws these wave period averaged models will result in inaccurate sediment transport predictions if sediment transport is mainly driven by wave resolving processes like frcs in addition these models cannot properly predict shoaling which is ubiquitous in surf zones because they neglect wave frequency dispersion or nonhydrostatic pressure effects as a result it would be inappropriate to use conventional models to simulate sediment transport driven by frcs which are a transient phenomenon caused by short individual wave refraction and breaking related to shoaling to simulate the physical processes of frcs we require a wave resolving model considering nonhydrostatic pressure and dispersion such as boussinesq type equation models nhwave ma et al 2012 swash zijlema and stelling 2008 and openfoam weller et al 1998 recently mancini et al 2020 simulated a morphodynamic model coupled with a wave resolving non hydrostatic pressure model although reasonable agreements were obtained against a laboratory experiment data frc did not occur in the laboratory channel because the experiment and simulation were conducted in a one dimensional channel park et al 2020 applied a morphodynamic model coupled with a boussinesq type equation and sediment transport models to a uniform sandbar beach their numerical simulation showed that strong frcs are associated with sediment advection to the outside of the sandbar area to the author s knowledge besides park et al 2020 no other research results have been presented on frc driven sediment transport modeling physically considering short individual waves in this study we extended the simulation of frc driven sediment transport on a sandbar beach by park et al 2020 to a plain beach and evaluated the effects of wave height and sediment size we compared the sediment transport processes and quantities with and without frcs we analyzed how frcs are transported in coastal areas in the depth integrated modeling framework finally we discussed potential contribution of frc to sediment flushing amplification and changes in the direction of cross shore suspended sediment transport 2 methods 2 1 model we used a wave current sediment interaction morphodynamic model kim 2015 kim et al 2017 the model solves a boussinesq type equation for flow a depth integrated advection diffusion equation for suspended sediment and sediment transport equations for bedloads the boussinesq type equation model is appropriate for surf zone process simulations because it can simulate nonlinear wave propagation refraction diffraction reflection shoaling and breaking the model can simulate phase resolving processes hence unlike phase averaged models it is appropriate for observing the inner mechanisms occurring within a wave period in addition the vorticity which is critically important for routing the pathline pattern of a scalar and turbulence effects are included the mass conservation equation of the boussinesq type equations considering

defined by a ui t uiuj xi fig 1 shows the schematic of the reference system and several main variables in this study x y represent the cross shore and alongshore directions respectively and u v represent the cross shore and alongshore direction flow velocities respectively we used fourth order accurate numerical schemes to solve the governing equations for the time integration of eqs 1 3 the third order accurate adams bashforth predictor scheme hairer et al 1993 and fourth order accurate adams moulton corrector scheme hairer et al 1993 were used to reconstruct the conserved quantities at the cell interfaces a fourth order accurate compact muscl tvd scheme was used the hllc harten lax van leer contact approximate riemann solver toro 2002 was used to calculate the numerical flux at the interface between computational cells for wet and dry bed change simulation a moving boundary scheme implemented by kim 2009 and lynett et al 2010 was employed more details about the numerical schemes are provided by kim 2015 a sponge layer was located at the end of the offshore boundary to prevent unphysical wave reflection from the boundary at the shoreline side boundary a wet dry bed changing technique was applied in the alongshore direction boundaries a periodic boundary condition was imposed the spatial grid sizes of x and y directions were equally 1 25 m and the time step was 0 05 s for all numerical simulations in this study the numerical model was verified for various coastal flows and sediment transport benchmark problems kim and lynett 2011a kim 2015 in particular the measured data of accretive and erosive beach profile tests conducted in the hydralab iii european research project sanchez arcilla et al 2011 were successfully reproduced by the numerical model kim et al 2017 2018 with a brier skill score van rijn et al 2003 of 0 84 0 33 because the scales of hydralab iii and the numerical simulations of kim et al 2017 2018 are comparable to the scale of the setup of this study as described in table 1 and the following section we can expect the numerical model to produce reasonable results at least for the simulations in this study 2 2 bathymetry and wave setup to test amplification of suspended sediment transport by frcs in a real field scale we adopted a uniform bathymetry of yu and slinn 2003 as follows 10 h x y a 1 a 1 γ 1 tanh b 1 x a 1 b 1 x γ 1 a 2 exp 5 x 90 90 2 where a 1 2 97 b 1 tan 0 075 and γ1 tan 0 075 tan 0 0064 a 2 0 and 1 5 for planar and barred beaches respectively this bathymetry represents the scales of the topography measured at duck north carolina usa lippmann et al 1999 the alongshore length of the computational domain was ly 800 m and the cross shore length was 580 m monochromatic waves were generated by a wave maker located 500 m from the shoreline using the internal source method proposed by hsiao et al 2005 to prevent longshore current occurrence normal incident waves were adopted fig 2 shows the initial bottom profiles and bottom profiles computed after one hour with wave height ho 1 m wave period tw 10 s and d 50 0 247 mm and the parameters in table 1 because the wave maker was parallel to the shoreline and the bathymetry was alongshore uniform no longshore currents or sediment transports were generated during the simulations fig 2 also shows that the setup was under accretive conditions this was an intentionally design to prevent a large amount of cross shore sediment flushing by incoming parallel waves without frcs in the above simulations shown in fig 2 no frc was generated thus to initiate instability in the flow field very small random variations of less than 0 005 h were added to the bathymetry where 5 h 4 5 m the perturbed offshore bathymetry generated alongshore variation in the parallel incoming waves in turn finite crest length wave breaking occurred and eventually frcs could be generated as described in feddersen 2014 fig 3 shows the computed bathymetry after 10 min under the same conditions as those in fig 2 but with the small random perturbation added to the initial bathymetry to induce frcs naturally the coastal flow resulted in morphological changes as shown in fig 3 which in turn will affect the flow therefore if we include the temporal bottom variation terms h t in the governing equations then it is difficult to determine whether the rip current was driven bathymetrically or non bathymetrically i e by frcs or not because the cross shore direction channel like bathymetry for example at y 700 m and between x 0 30 m will grow as the simulation continues and then bathymetrically driven rip currents can dominate the flow field considering the prior simulation in fig 3 on mobile bed where bathymetrically driven rip currents can occur we conducted another prior simulation on the bathymetries without the small random perturbation and the temporal bottom variation terms h t thus in this simulation frcs did not occur unlike fig 3 and morphological changes did not occur unlike figs 2 and 3 the other conditions and parameters were the same with those in fig 3 ho 1 m tw 10 s d 50 0 247 mm and the parameters in table 1 as a result all computed results were alongshore parallel as shown in fig 4 although we assumed h t 0 in this test all the other terms were computed thus the erosion advection and deposition processes were included during simulations fig 4 also shows that the sediment flux per tw in the cross shore direction was almost zero without frcs on the rigid uniform beaches except in the swash zone where represents the wave period averaged value thus we could hypothesize that the tested wave and bathymetry conditions in fig 4 could not transport the sediments in the surf zone to the offshore area without frcs under the tested conditions in the following sections based on the three preliminary numerical tests we finally adopted the uniform bathymetry described in eq 10 with the very small random variations of less than 0 005h where 5 h 4 5 m in addition to prevent bathymetrically driven rip current generation we assumed h t 0 thus although the bottom could supply sediments and the suspended sediments could fall to the bottom the elevation of the bathymetry was unchanged the perturbed offshore bathymetry generated alongshore variation in the parallel incoming waves in turn finite crest length wave breaking occurred and eventually frcs could be generated as shown in animations s1 and s2 where transient strong u 0 5 m s offshore directed water flows occur at random locations last for o 10 min and then decay each simulation in the following sections ran for 9 600 s 6 000 t 3 600 s for the first 1800 s the waves were almost parallel in the entire domain thus we used the last 3 600 s 0 t 3 600 s of data for the analysis to remove the initial transient results for all simulations ρ s 2 650 kg m3 and ϕ 0 0001 were chosen it is important to note that the present setup for waves bathymetry and sediments was a reasonable approximation observed in the field or laboratory experiments as noted above and in table 1 the scales and parameters in eqs 5 9 are reasonable for the setup simulated in this study and the scales are representative of those in various studies including those by yu and slinn 2003 and murray 2004 3 results 3 1 flow and sediment transport patterns with frcs fig 5 animations s1 and s2 shows the simulated nearshore flows sediment transports and vertical vorticity ω patterns of ho 1 m tw 10 s and d 50 0 247 mm the incoming parallel waves propagated towards the shoreline and began breaking at x 40 and 90 m on the planar and barred beaches respectively the differences in the breaking points xb resulted from the sandbar which accelerated shoaling and the steep waves broke on the sandbar the erosion and deposition processes were relatively active near the shoreline i e x 15 m where h 1 m as shown in fig 5g and 5n frcs narrow and seaward direction nearshore flow of u 0 5 m s and time scale of o 10 min were generated in the surf zones fig 5c and 5j animations s1 and s2 and propagated seaward mushroom like suspended sediment plumes and dipole structures of ω followed the frc heads fig 5d 5e 5k and 5l in addition ω and hc formed long and narrow tails as frcs thus u ω and hc in fig 5 have similar spatial patterns it is well known that the distributions of c and ω are similar in two dimensional space because the two dimensional vorticity and scalar transport equations state that both ω and c are equally advected by flow davidson 2018 however note that the similarity between c and ω is true when the source locations of c and ω are the same and they decay coincidently hence we can deduce that the source locations of c and ω coincide in the simulated flow fields and decay together as they are transported in the seaward direction as discussed in section 4 without frcs as shown in fig 4 the mushroom pattern of hc was not generated during the simulations thus locally concentrated advective suspended sediment flux hubc was not observed from the comparison of figs 5 and 4 we can infer that the mushroom like sediment plumes in fig 5 originated from frcs which indicates that frcs can change the advective suspended sediment flux at least in terms of quality a quantitative comparison of with and without frcs is provided in the following sections 3 2 flushing quantity with and without frcs to quantify the sediment flushing by frcs we estimated the unit sediment discharge advected by frcs as follows 11 h u b c 1 l y 1 l t 0 l t 0 l y h u b c x y 1 m d y d t where ly is alongshore length as shown in fig 1 and lt is the time duration for time averaging as noted above each simulation ran for 9 600 s 6 000 t 3 600 s and we used the data of the last 3 600 s s 0 t 3 600 s for the analysis to remove the initial transient results thus lt is given by 3600 s fig 6a shows the significant difference of h u b c with and without frcs for ho 1 m tw 10 s and d 50 0 247 mm over the surf zone and offshore area the magnitudes of h u b c with frcs became o 10 1 10 2 times larger than those without frcs in the planar bathymetry this implies that the suspended sediments that would stay in the swash zone and inner surf zone without an frc could be flushed seaward and eventually beyond the surf zone with frcs at least for the tested conditions however relying on only one dimensional cross shore direction wave characteristics where frcs are not considered might lead to low prediction accuracy by missing the frc associated sediment processes on the planar beach for the barred beach fig 6b hubc with frcs is larger than hubc without frcs however the difference between the two quantities is smaller compared to the results shown in fig 6a that is the sandbar geometry affected the quantity of suspended sediment discharge which is discussed in the following section the planar beach case in fig 6a shows that the farther away from the shoreline the smaller h u b c is continuously over the entire domain the barred beach case shows a more complicated tendency at the inside of the sandbar from the shoreline to the beginning point of the sandbar x 50 m h u b c decreased as x increased however h u b c increased in the sandbar section and decreased again beyond the sandbar area interestingly h u b c on the onshore side of the sandbar i e the green circle in fig 6b has a negative value that is the suspended sediments between the shoreline and onshore side of the sandbar were trapped inside of the sandbar between the shoreline and the sandbar and thus could not be transported easily beyond the sandbar under the tested conditions in terms of wave period and alongshore length averages 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between frcs and c de and er fig 7 shows the time series of wave resolving and wave averaged physical variables at several points on a pathline of the frc in the dotted box of fig 5d where ho 1 m tw 10 s and d 50 0 247 mm the nearshore flow field in fig 7 was generated by the incoming waves thus u naturally oscillated back and forth with period tw u the trend of u in fig 7a slowly increased and then decreased the state of u 0 5 m s defined as frcs only lasted for a few minutes at each point fig 7b but appeared to last for o 10 min considering the entire extension of the frcs animation s1 and s2 this u of the frcs was closely related to c the pearson s correlation coefficient of which was ρ c u 0 88 that is a high concentration was observed only when and where a strong frc existed without any frc a relatively low concentration and small er and de were detected as shown in fig 7f 7j the small oscillatory components of c fig 7b might have resulted from the oscillation of hubc and er fig 7c and 7d because hubc is a function of the cross shore flow velocity the suspended sediments at a point oscillated in the onshore and offshore directions when a strong frc occurred there i e u was larger than some threshold the wave averaged advective sediment flux hubc transported the sediment particles seaward fig 7c in addition er was dependent on the instantaneous flow velocity magnitudes and hence showed an oscillatory pattern fig 7d de was less oscillatory compared to er fig 7e because it was directly dependent on c in fig 7b rather than the instantaneous flow velocity as with advective flux the erosion and deposition rates increased when an frc passed therefore from these relationships among the flow velocity erosion rate and deposition rate observed in fig 7 we can infer that frcs could significantly affect the magnitudes of the advective sediment flux local erosion and deposition therefore it is important to accurately predict not only the wave properties but also the currents that cause erosion and advection 4 2 effects of sandbar on frc driven sediment flushing sediment concentrations were directly affected by frcs as noted above because sandbars directly affect wave breaking the characteristics of frcs a type of surf zone eddy closely related to alongshore crest length limited breaking waves feddersen 2014 and their associated vorticity characteristics differed for the two tested bathymetries fig 8 shows the vertical vorticity spectrum e ω x ky using a 1 hz alongshore simulation output for ho 1 m tw 10 s and d 50 0 247 mm over 3 600 s where ky is alongshore wave number in an isotropic two dimensional flow the energy and enstrophy cascade power law exponents of velocity spectra eu are 5 3 and 3 respectively because the vorticity and velocity spectra are related to e ω e u k y 2 antonia et al 1996 the power law exponents of the vorticity spectra for the energy and enstrophy cascade in two dimensional flows are 1 3 and 1 respectively although the nearshore flows were not strictly governed by two dimensional turbulence theory owing to water depth variation two dimensional turbulence energy and enstrophy cascades seemed to appear in the simulated flows as shown in fig 8 for x 20 m relatively steep positive slopes were observed for k y 0 07 and 0 09 on the planar and barred bathymetries respectively for larger ky e ω decreases for both bathymetries for 20 x 100 m the maximum e ω was approximately within the ranges k y 5 10 2 10 1 and 3 10 2 5 10 2 on the planar and barred beaches respectively the vorticity forcing magnitude increased further as x decreased on the planar beach compared to that on the barred beach in addition e ω on the barred beach was generally smaller than that on the planar beach considering the maximum values of e ω and corresponding ky the vorticity for the planar bathymetry was more energetic and spatially concentrated than on the barred bathymetry thus more frequent surf zone eddies i e frcs were generated on the planar beach as shown in fig 5e and 5l in turn more sediments were flushed towards the offshore area on the planar beach as shown in fig 6 this implies that the sandbar can protect the beach from erosion by dissipating the wave energy associated with frc generation 4 3 effects of wave height and sediment size fig 9 shows the simulation results with the same d 50 0 247 mm and tw 10 s but different values of ho 0 75 1 0 1 25 m because frcs are closely related to alongshore crest length limited breaking waves directly affected by ho stronger u and ω were generated for a larger ho as shown in fig 9a 9f in turn stronger frcs produced higher hc by following the processes in fig 7 as shown in fig 9g 9i and discussed above eventually h u b c the spatiotemporal average value of the product of hc and ub became larger for larger ho as shown in fig 10 fig 11 shows the simulation results with the same ho 1 m and tw 10 s but different values of d 50 0 124 0 247 0 371 mm because the magnitude of hc o 0 1 in fig 11 the influence of the horizontal density variation on the flow motions is negligible thus the ω of the three flow fields in fig 11a 11c decreased similarly with each other in proportion to x because ω decayed by drag from bottom friction and turbulent viscosity dependent on the flow characteristics although the flow characteristics were the same the hc of the larger sediments decayed more rapidly in proportion to x than that of the smaller sediments as shown in fig 11 d f since the only difference among the three simulations is the d 50 values we can see that the differences of the cross shore distributions of hc result from the difference of the d 50 values as appeared in equation for the sediment particle settling velocity ws included in the deposition rate equation de ws is proportional to d 50 in the three simulations the ws of d 50 0 371 mm and 0 247 mm are 5 5 and 3 3 times larger than the ws of d 50 0 124 mm in turn the deposition rates of the larger sediments increase more effectively as a result the h u b c of the smaller size sediments became larger than that of large size sediments in the same flow fields as shown in figure 11g fig 10 and 11g and fig s2 also show that there are up tp o 10 times differences between the h u b c with and without frcs which indicates that frcs can accelerate suspended sediment flushing under a relative variety of conditions at least in the depth integrated modeling framework therefore although verification is required through physical experiments if we conducted two physical experiments with the same setup same uniform wave height normal incident angle sediment properties and alongshore uniform bottom geometry in horizontal one dimensional channels where frcs are not generated and a two dimensional basin where frcs occur then different sediment transport results would be found in terms of quality and quantity 4 4 importance of local hydrodynamics from the observation of the decay process and decreasing flux quantity in proportion to x it is questionable how and from where the suspended sediment particles beyond the surf zone came for example did the mushroom like sediment plume in fig 11e originate in the swash zone and then travel to the outside of the surf zone or was it picked up around there by the local flow to investigate this we simulated the same setup with er x xb 0 and er x xb 0 on the planar beach with ho 1 m tw 10 s and d 50 0 247 mm thus erosion occurred only for x xb and x xb in the former and latter cases respectively considering er x xb 0 the suspended sediments at x xb in fig 12a were advected by the frc from inside the surf zone however the suspended sediments beyond xb were deposited quickly and did not travel far hence the suspended sediment plumes at x xb in figs 5 9 and 11 were partially supplied through local area erosion beyond xb fig 12b shows the case with er x xb 0 where suspended sediment plumes could be easily found although the sediments were not supplied from the inside of the surf zone thus we can deduce that the processes of advection erosion and deposition occur progressively towards the offshore direction by following the movement of frcs as shown in figs 7 and 12d and these progressive processes carry sediments seaward therefore it is important to accurately predict not only the wave properties but also the local hydrodynamics that cause erosion and advection 4 5 nondispersive and hydrostatic modeling results to investigate the effect of nonhydrostatic pressure and frequency dispersion on frc driven sediment transport we compared the simulation results of the boussinesq type equation model considering nonhydrostatic pressure and dispersion to the results of the shallow water equation model excluding these physical processes this comparison is important because in terms of theory those physical differences between the two models are critical for wave shoaling refraction and breaking which are ultimately related to sediment transport processes as noted in the above sections in addition shallow water equation based morphodynamic modeling is popular in engineering applications but various uncertainties still remain by neglecting the higher order terms h t h c and h m other than the bottom friction and turbulent viscosity terms the boussinesq type equation in section 2 1 becomes a shallow water equation considering horizontal density variation this shallow water equation based sediment transport model was solved by the same numerical schemes as for the boussinesq type equation model i e the fourth order accurate finite volume method using the hllc approximate riemann solver fig 13a 13f show the patterns of u hc and ω computed by the shallow water equation based model with ho 1 m tw 10 s and d 50 0 247 mm compared to the results considering the nonhydrostatic pressure and dispersion much weaker u and ω and low hc values were observed as a result a much smaller amount of suspended sediments were flushed out of the surf zone than when nonhydrostatic pressure and dispersion were considered as shown in fig 13g and 13h therefore to accurately predict suspended sediment transport in nearshore areas it is necessary to properly consider the nonhydrostatic pressure and frequency dispersion without them it will be difficult to consider the two dimensionality of flow and transport such as the alongshore convergence murray 2004 which is closely related to refraction and crest length limited breaking although it still requires excessive model tuning we can partially consider the short wave effects on nearshore flows as noted in the introduction by employing radiation stress a full understanding of the link between short wave effects such as nonhydrostatic pressure and frc driven sediment transport will be able to improve the prediction ability of various sediment transport prediction models by reducing the uncertainties in model parameters the boussinesq type equation used in this study is based on kim et al 2009 which is derived using a perturbation approach with a long wave scale parameter μ the high order terms related to the dispersion and nonhydrostatic pressure equally have the same scale μ2 therefore if we ignore the μ2 scale terms then the boussinesq type equation becomes shallow water equations for non dispersive and hydrostatic flows if we consider μ2 scale terms then both dispersion and nonhydrostatic pressure terms remain in the boussinesq type equation together the derivation of new boussinesq type equations considering separately the nonhydrostatic pressure and dispersion will be appreciable but it is beyond of this study 5 conclusions the major findings obtained from the depth integrated numerical modeling considering non hydrostatic pressure and frequency dispersion and analysis using normal incoming uniform waves on two real field scale uniform bathymetries can be summarized as follows 1 frcs can significantly amplify suspended sediment concentration and transport beyond the surf zone even in accretive wave environments frcs can increase seaward sediment flux by up to o 102 times at least under the tested conditions therefore not only one dimensional cross shore wave and flow properties but also frcs including both cross and alongshore direction waves and current properties must be considered for accurate sediment transport predictions in nearshore areas it should be noted that although the proposed numerical simulations may not be representative of general real world cases the simulated results and analyses demonstrate the potential of the proposed amplification processes to occur occasionally in the real world understanding this process will be helpful in decreasing the uncertainty related to sediment transport quantity and direction in nearshore areas 2 the simulation results confirm the necessity of non hydrostatic pressure and wave dispersion effects to accurately reproduce frc driven suspended sediment transport without these factors frc generation which are closely related to wave refraction and breaking cannot be predicted accurately eventually the quantity of suspended sediment flushing can be significantly underestimated although we simulated the frc driven sediment transport processes with only the boussinesq type equation and sediment transport models proposed by kim 2015 and kim et al 2009 2017 other wave resolving three dimensional and depth integrated models considering nonhydrostatic pressure and frequency dispersion may result in the same conclusions 3 frcs progressively transport sediments because sediment density inhibits suspended sediment particles from traveling away sediments supplied by local erosion amplified by frcs play an important role in suspended sediment transport processes therefore it is important to accurately predict not only statistical wave and flow properties but also local hydrodynamics that cause erosion and advection this accurate local hydrodynamic information can be obtained only when we consider nonhydrostatic pressure and dispersive effects with wave resolving modeling approaches which is a main deficiency of the conventional phase averaged modeling approaches for frc driven sediment transport prediction 4 sandbars can protect beaches from erosion and trap sediments between the shoreline and sandbar spatiotemporal average wise even when an frc occurs by dissipating wave energy associated with frc generation the following limitations of these conclusions are clear first nearshore flow and sediment transport are three dimensional processes in the present depth integrated framework the vertical motions of water flow and sediment are simply modeled instead of being resolved thus the effects of the bursting phenomena generated from the bottom boundary layer heathershaw and thorne 1985 and surface wave breaking scott et al 2006 were not explicitly considered in this study second we tested various idealized conditions such as non cohesive sediment spatially uniform sediment size limited wave conditions and uniform beach bathymetry using a numerical model various other physical parameters such as bottom topography must also be investigated for example frc prevalence decreases with increasing bottom slope murray et al 2003 other types of sediment transport processes like bedload driven by frc remain unknown therefore it is necessary to verify the presented results and conclusions using large scale laboratory experiments or field observations however as noted above it will be very difficult to measure frcs and related sediment concentrations together due to their spatiotemporally transient nature although various physical processes in nature can be represented in physical experiments using distorted or undistorted scale models fundamental parameters such as wave height wave length water depth and orbital and flow velocities in horizontal two dimensional physical models are generally much smaller than those seen in nature in horizontal one dimensional physical models the scale problem with the fundamental parameters can be removed but frcs are not generated in these models considering these difficulties in one and two dimensional physical models it will be difficult to conduct physical model experiments properly representing frc characteristics and frc driven sediment transport without scale problems it should be noted that this study emphasized not the calibration of several parameters to improve model performance but on the change i e potential amplification of suspended sediment flux by frcs currently few existing models can predict full physical processes in surf zones and none of them is sufficiently reliable for engineering purposes without parameter calibration mancini et al 2020 therefore for generalization various wave bathymetry and sediment conditions must be tested after verification by measurements this will improve the understanding of frc driven sediment transport mechanisms and associated prediction skills by reducing excessive model tuning credit authorship

255,until recently wave and hydrodynamic properties in the cross shore direction have been linked to accretive or erosive morphological evolution however various uncertainties remain hindering the full understanding and accurate prediction of the transport direction and quantity of sediment transport in nearshore areas in this study we showed that flash rip currents frcs could significantly amplify suspended sediment flushing out of the surf zone by greatly increasing advective flux even under accretive wave conditions in a depth integrated modeling framework compared to the case without frcs where only one dimensional cross shore direction waves and currents exist frc driven seaward advective sediment flux increased by approximately o 102 times under normal incoming waves on alongshore uniform beaches at least for the tested wave and bathymetry conditions to properly consider the role of frcs in suspended sediment flushing short wave related physics such as nonhydrostatic pressure and frequency dispersion had to be included in addition it was important to accurately predict not only wave properties but also local hydrodynamics that cause erosion and advection finally uniform sandbars prevented beach erosion even when frcs occurred on uniform beaches by dissipating the wave energy closely associated with frc generation therefore one dimensional cross shore direction approaches neglecting the role of frc driven sediment transport processes which are closely related to short wave motions and occur in two dimensional space could lead to lower prediction accuracy keywords flash rip current suspended sediment transport depth integrated model numerical model non hydrostatic pressure 1 introduction the fate of sediments in nearshore areas is one of the major research concerns in coastal science and engineering communities because it can significantly affect the morphology ecology and human activities in these areas deigaard 1992 jing and ridd 1997 dean and dalrymple 2001 generally sediment transport is split into alongshore and cross shore transport although cross shore sediment flux is much smaller than alongshore sediment flux cross shore sediment transport plays a vital role in beach profile evolution and the profile strongly affects alongshore currents and transport grasso et al 2009 many tools have been developed to predict sediment transport and morphological change some based on simple parameters and others on complex physical processes determining the quantity of cross shore sediment flux is a crucial factor among several for accurate prediction some of the most widely used methods energetic approaches bagnold 1966 are based on the steady flow concept statistical properties such as wave asymmetry velocity skewness and acceleration skewness have been found to be closely related to onshore and offshore sediment transport and have been used to improve the performance of models bailard 1981 hoefel and elgar 2003 grasso et al 2011 since these sediment transport models are based on statistical properties effects of wave resolving processes like flash rip current frc on sediment transport can be neglected in the statistical approaches thus if there are important sediment transport mechanisms depending on wave resolving processes we need to find them out to improve the sediment transport prediction accuracy for example murray et al 2003 observed a coastal flow and sediment transport event at torrey pines beach california us during a storm event in the view of time average no rip current occurred near the field site however a rip current did occur there and associate sediment plume was observed murray et al 2003 therefore it will be difficult to accurately predict these rip current driven sediment transport processes with statistical approaches more recently in addition to statistical wave characteristics bathymetrically driven rip currents have been highlighted as a major mechanism for rip channel development yu and slinn 2003 murray 2004 castelle et al 2010 bathymetrically driven rip currents occur at fixed alongshore locations or along rip channels and are a component of the mean circulation macmahan et al 2006 dalrymple et al 2011 rip currents are narrow and intense nearshore flows in the seaward direction generated in the surf zone consequently they can transport materials in cross shore directions reniers et al 2010 dalrymple et al 2011 castelle and coco 2013 and kumar and feddersen 2017 showed that rip currents can effectively flush passive scalars from the surf zone to the inner shelf talbot and bate 1987 macmahan et al 2005 and thorpe et al 2013 conducted real world field studies to investigate the relationship between bathymetrically driven rip currents and associated sediment transport another type of rip currents one that is not bathymetrically driven and is known as a transient rip current or frc is occasionally observed on open coast beaches the characteristics of frcs that occur on uniform beaches and last for o 10 min and then decay are spatially and temporally variable unlike those of bathymetrically driven rip currents which are accompanied by rip channels johnson and pattiaratchi 2006 unlike bathymetrically driven rip current frc is surf zone eddies generated by finite crest length wave breaking and coalesce of the eddies johnson and pattiaratchi 2006 hally rosendahl and feddersen 2016 understanding frc driven sediment transport is important because frcs occurred frequently in surf zones a real world passive tracer field experiment was conducted to evaluate frc driven exchange hally rosendahl et al 2014 although however passive tracers can effectively show the pathways of tracer particles the density of passive scalars is different from the density of sediment in the real world which can lead to different transport results between the passive and active tracers in addition their spatiotemporal transient nature makes it difficult to measure frc driven sediment transport in the real world although numerical approaches also have limitations such as numerical errors and limited physical processes they can be used for sediment transport studies as an alternative to analytical and observational approaches many morphodynamic models have been developed and applied to various coastal areas for example van ormondt et al 2020 recently developed a process based numerical model composed of delft3d lesser et al 2004 and xbeach roelvink et al 2010 to capture the hydrodynamics responsible for breach evolution during a storm event where the delft3d model was coupled with the swan spectral wave model booij et al 1999 to consider the short wave effects huynh et al 2017 developed a morphodynamic model coupled with a nonlinear shallow water equation model and sediment transport model applicable to long and non breaking wave environments harter and figlus 2017 simulated the morphological changes of an island during a hurricane event using the shallow water equation based version of the xbeach model coupled with a depth averaged sediment transport model bertin et al 2009 developed the morsys2d modeling system by integrating the hydrostatic flow model elcirc zhang and baptista 2004 swan and the sand2d morphology model fortunato 2007 the hydrodynamic model considered short wave effects by including the wave radiation stress longuet higgins and stewart 1960 in the momentum equations although various others including the above mentioned numerical models and applications have been reported most of the numerical modelings for wave induced nearshore circulations have been based on short wave period averaged mass and momentum conservation laws these wave period averaged models will result in inaccurate sediment transport predictions if sediment transport is mainly driven by wave resolving processes like frcs in addition these models cannot properly predict shoaling which is ubiquitous in surf zones because they neglect wave frequency dispersion or nonhydrostatic pressure effects as a result it would be inappropriate to use conventional models to simulate sediment transport driven by frcs which are a transient phenomenon caused by short individual wave refraction and breaking related to shoaling to simulate the physical processes of frcs we require a wave resolving model considering nonhydrostatic pressure and dispersion such as boussinesq type equation models nhwave ma et al 2012 swash zijlema and stelling 2008 and openfoam weller et al 1998 recently mancini et al 2020 simulated a morphodynamic model coupled with a wave resolving non hydrostatic pressure model although reasonable agreements were obtained against a laboratory experiment data frc did not occur in the laboratory channel because the experiment and simulation were conducted in a one dimensional channel park et al 2020 applied a morphodynamic model coupled with a boussinesq type equation and sediment transport models to a uniform sandbar beach their numerical simulation showed that strong frcs are associated with sediment advection to the outside of the sandbar area to the author s knowledge besides park et al 2020 no other research results have been presented on frc driven sediment transport modeling physically considering short individual waves in this study we extended the simulation of frc driven sediment transport on a sandbar beach by park et al 2020 to a plain beach and evaluated the effects of wave height and sediment size we compared the sediment transport processes and quantities with and without frcs we analyzed how frcs are transported in coastal areas in the depth integrated modeling framework finally we discussed potential contribution of frc to sediment flushing amplification and changes in the direction of cross shore suspended sediment transport 2 methods 2 1 model we used a wave current sediment interaction morphodynamic model kim 2015 kim et al 2017 the model solves a boussinesq type equation for flow a depth integrated advection diffusion equation for suspended sediment and sediment transport equations for bedloads the boussinesq type equation model is appropriate for surf zone process simulations because it can simulate nonlinear wave propagation refraction diffraction reflection shoaling and breaking the model can simulate phase resolving processes hence unlike phase averaged models it is appropriate for observing the inner mechanisms occurring within a wave period in addition the vorticity which is critically important for routing the pathline pattern of a scalar and turbulence effects are included the mass conservation equation of the boussinesq type equations considering

third order accurate adams bashforth predictor scheme hairer et al 1993 and fourth order accurate adams moulton corrector scheme hairer et al 1993 were used to reconstruct the conserved quantities at the cell interfaces a fourth order accurate compact muscl tvd scheme was used the hllc harten lax van leer contact approximate riemann solver toro 2002 was used to calculate the numerical flux at the

are provided by kim 2015 a sponge layer was located at the end of the offshore boundary to prevent unphysical wave reflection from the boundary at the shoreline side boundary a wet dry bed changing technique was applied in the alongshore direction boundaries a periodic boundary condition was imposed the spatial grid sizes of x and y directions were equally 1 25 m and the time step was 0 05 s for all numerical simulations in this study the numerical model was verified for various coastal flows and sediment transport benchmark problems kim and lynett 2011a kim 2015 in particular the measured data of accretive and erosive beach profile tests conducted in the hydralab iii european research project sanchez arcilla et al 2011 were successfully reproduced by the numerical model kim et al 2017 2018 with a brier skill score van rijn et al 2003 of 0 84 0 33 because the scales of hydralab iii and the numerical simulations of kim et al 2017 2018 are comparable to the scale of the setup of this study as described in table 1 and the following section we can expect the numerical model to produce reasonable results at least for the simulations in this study 2 2 bathymetry and wave setup to test amplification of suspended sediment transport by frcs in a real field scale we adopted a uniform bathymetry of yu and slinn 2003 as follows 10 h x y a 1 a 1 γ 1 tanh b 1 x a 1 b 1 x γ 1 a 2 exp 5 x 90 90 2 where a 1 2 97 b 1 tan 0 075 and γ1 tan 0 075 tan 0 0064 a 2 0 and 1 5 for planar and barred beaches respectively this bathymetry represents the scales of the topography measured at duck north carolina usa lippmann et al 1999 the alongshore length of the computational domain was ly 800 m and the cross shore length was 580 m monochromatic waves were generated by a wave maker located 500 m from the shoreline using the internal source method proposed by hsiao et al 2005 to prevent longshore current occurrence normal incident waves were adopted fig 2 shows the initial bottom profiles and bottom profiles computed after one hour with wave height ho 1 m wave period tw 10 s and d 50 0 247 mm and the parameters in table 1 because the wave maker was parallel to the shoreline and the bathymetry was alongshore uniform no longshore currents or sediment transports were generated during the simulations fig 2 also shows that the setup was under accretive conditions this was an intentionally design to prevent a large amount of cross shore sediment flushing by incoming parallel waves without frcs in the above simulations shown in fig 2 no frc was generated thus to initiate instability in the flow field very small random variations of less than 0 005 h were added to the bathymetry where 5 h 4 5 m the perturbed offshore bathymetry generated alongshore variation in the parallel incoming waves in turn finite crest length wave breaking occurred and eventually frcs could be generated as described in feddersen 2014 fig 3 shows the computed bathymetry after 10 min under the same conditions as those in fig 2 but with the small random perturbation added to the initial bathymetry to induce frcs naturally the coastal flow resulted in morphological changes as shown in fig 3 which in turn will affect the flow therefore if we include the temporal bottom variation terms h t in the governing equations then it is difficult to determine whether the rip current was driven bathymetrically or non bathymetrically i e by frcs or not because the cross shore direction channel like bathymetry for example at y 700 m and between x 0 30 m will grow as the simulation continues and then bathymetrically driven rip currents can dominate the flow field considering the prior simulation in fig 3 on mobile bed where bathymetrically driven rip currents can occur we conducted another prior simulation on the bathymetries without the small random perturbation and the temporal bottom variation terms h t thus in this simulation frcs did not occur unlike fig 3 and morphological changes did not occur unlike figs 2 and 3 the other conditions and parameters were the same with those in fig 3 ho 1 m tw 10 s d 50 0 247 mm and the parameters in table 1 as a result all computed results were alongshore parallel as shown in fig 4 although we assumed h t 0 in this test all the other terms were computed thus the erosion advection and deposition processes were included during simulations fig 4 also shows that the sediment flux per tw in the cross shore direction was almost zero without frcs on the rigid uniform beaches except in the swash zone where represents the wave period averaged value thus we could hypothesize that the tested wave and bathymetry conditions in fig 4 could not transport the sediments in the surf zone to the offshore area without frcs under the tested conditions in the following sections based on the three preliminary numerical tests we finally adopted the uniform bathymetry described in eq 10 with the very small random variations of less than 0 005h where 5 h 4 5 m in addition to prevent bathymetrically driven rip current generation we assumed h t 0 thus although the bottom could supply sediments and the suspended sediments could fall to the bottom the elevation of the bathymetry was unchanged the perturbed offshore bathymetry generated alongshore variation in the parallel incoming waves in turn finite crest length wave breaking occurred and eventually frcs could be generated as shown in animations s1 and s2 where transient strong u 0 5 m s offshore directed water flows occur at random locations last for o 10 min and then decay each simulation in the following sections ran for 9 600 s 6 000 t 3 600 s for the first 1800 s the waves were almost parallel in the entire domain thus we used the last 3 600 s 0 t 3 600 s of data for the analysis to remove the initial transient results for all simulations ρ s 2 650 kg m3 and ϕ 0 0001 were chosen it is important to note that the present setup for waves bathymetry and sediments was a reasonable approximation observed in the field or laboratory experiments as noted above and in table 1 the scales and parameters in eqs 5 9 are reasonable for the setup simulated in this study and the scales are representative of those in various studies including those by yu and slinn 2003 and murray 2004 3 results 3 1 flow and sediment transport patterns with frcs fig 5 animations s1 and s2 shows the simulated nearshore flows sediment transports and vertical vorticity ω patterns of ho 1 m tw 10 s and d 50 0 247 mm the incoming parallel waves propagated towards the shoreline and began breaking at x 40 and 90 m on the planar and barred beaches respectively the differences in the breaking points xb resulted from the sandbar which accelerated shoaling and the steep waves broke on the sandbar the erosion and deposition processes were relatively active near the shoreline i e x 15 m where h 1 m as shown in fig 5g and 5n frcs narrow and seaward direction nearshore flow of u 0 5 m s and time scale of o 10 min were generated in the surf zones fig 5c and 5j animations s1 and s2 and propagated seaward mushroom like suspended sediment plumes and dipole structures of ω followed the frc heads fig 5d 5e 5k and 5l in addition ω and hc formed long and narrow tails as frcs thus u ω and hc in fig 5 have similar spatial patterns it is well known that the distributions of c and ω are similar in two dimensional space because the two dimensional vorticity and scalar transport equations state that both ω and c are equally advected by flow davidson 2018 however note that the similarity between c and ω is true when the source locations of c and ω are the same and they decay coincidently hence we can deduce that the source locations of c and ω coincide in the simulated flow fields and decay together as they are transported in the seaward direction as discussed in section 4 without frcs as shown in fig 4 the mushroom pattern of hc was not generated during the simulations thus locally concentrated advective suspended sediment flux hubc was not observed from the comparison of figs 5 and 4 we can infer that the mushroom like sediment plumes in fig 5 originated from frcs which indicates that frcs can change the advective suspended sediment flux at least in terms of quality a quantitative comparison of with and without frcs is provided in the following sections 3 2 flushing quantity with and without frcs to quantify the sediment flushing by frcs we estimated the unit sediment discharge advected by frcs as follows 11 h u b c 1 l y 1 l t 0 l t 0 l y h u b c x y 1 m d y d t where ly is alongshore length as shown in fig 1 and lt is the time duration for time averaging as noted above each simulation ran for 9 600 s 6 000 t 3 600 s and we used the data of the last 3 600 s s 0 t 3 600 s for the analysis to remove the initial transient results thus lt is given by 3600 s fig 6a shows the significant difference of h u b c with and without frcs for ho 1 m tw 10 s and d 50 0 247 mm over the surf zone and offshore area the magnitudes of h u b c with frcs became o 10 1 10 2 times larger than those without frcs in the planar bathymetry this implies that the suspended sediments that would stay in the swash zone and inner surf zone without an frc could be flushed seaward and eventually beyond the surf zone with frcs at least for the tested conditions however relying on only one dimensional cross shore direction wave characteristics where frcs are not considered might lead to low prediction accuracy by missing the frc associated sediment processes on the planar beach for the barred beach fig 6b hubc with frcs is larger than hubc without frcs however the difference between the two quantities is smaller compared to the results shown in fig 6a that is the sandbar geometry affected the quantity of suspended sediment discharge which is discussed in the following section the planar beach case in fig 6a shows that the farther away from the shoreline the smaller h u b c is continuously over the entire domain the barred beach case shows a more complicated tendency at the inside of the sandbar from the shoreline to the beginning point of the sandbar x 50 m h u b c decreased as x increased however h u b c increased in the sandbar section and decreased again beyond the sandbar area interestingly h u b c on the onshore side of the sandbar i e the green circle in fig 6b has a negative value that is the suspended sediments between the shoreline and onshore side of the sandbar were trapped inside of the sandbar between the shoreline and the sandbar and thus could not be transported easily beyond the sandbar under the tested conditions in terms of wave period and alongshore length averages 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between frcs and c de and er fig 7 shows the time series of wave resolving and wave averaged physical variables at several points on a pathline of the frc in the dotted box of fig 5d where ho 1 m tw 10 s and d 50 0 247 mm the nearshore flow field in fig 7 was generated by the incoming waves thus u naturally oscillated back and forth with period tw u the trend of u in fig 7a slowly increased and then decreased the state of u 0 5 m s defined as frcs only lasted for a few minutes at each point fig 7b but appeared to last for o 10 min considering the entire extension of the frcs animation s1 and s2 this u of the frcs was closely related to c the pearson s correlation coefficient of which was ρ c u 0 88 that is a high concentration was observed only when and where a strong frc existed without any frc a relatively low concentration and small er and de were detected as shown in fig 7f 7j the small oscillatory components of c fig 7b might have resulted from the oscillation of hubc and er fig 7c and 7d because hubc is a function of the cross shore flow velocity the suspended sediments at a point oscillated in the onshore and offshore directions when a strong frc occurred there i e u was larger than some threshold the wave averaged advective sediment flux hubc transported the sediment particles seaward fig 7c in addition er was dependent on the instantaneous flow velocity magnitudes and hence showed an oscillatory pattern fig 7d de was less oscillatory compared to er fig 7e because it was directly dependent on c in fig 7b rather than the instantaneous flow velocity as with advective flux the erosion and deposition rates increased when an frc passed therefore from these relationships among the flow velocity erosion rate and deposition rate observed in fig 7 we can infer that frcs could significantly affect the magnitudes of the advective sediment flux local erosion and deposition therefore it is important to accurately predict not only the wave properties but also the currents that cause erosion and advection 4 2 effects of sandbar on frc driven sediment flushing sediment concentrations were directly affected by frcs as noted above because sandbars directly affect wave breaking the characteristics of frcs a type of surf zone eddy closely related to alongshore crest length limited breaking waves feddersen 2014 and their associated vorticity characteristics differed for the two tested bathymetries fig 8 shows the vertical vorticity spectrum e ω x ky using a 1 hz alongshore simulation output for ho 1 m tw 10 s and d 50 0 247 mm over 3 600 s where ky is alongshore wave number in an isotropic two dimensional flow the energy and enstrophy cascade power law exponents of velocity spectra eu are 5 3 and 3 respectively because the vorticity and velocity spectra are related to e ω e u k y 2 antonia et al 1996 the power law exponents of the vorticity spectra for the energy and enstrophy cascade in two dimensional flows are 1 3 and 1 respectively although the nearshore flows were not strictly governed by two dimensional turbulence theory owing to water depth variation two dimensional turbulence energy and enstrophy cascades seemed to appear in the simulated flows as shown in fig 8 for x 20 m relatively steep positive slopes were observed for k y 0 07 and 0 09 on the planar and barred bathymetries respectively for larger ky e ω decreases for both bathymetries for 20 x 100 m the maximum e ω was approximately within the ranges k y 5 10 2 10 1 and 3 10 2 5 10 2 on the planar and barred beaches respectively the vorticity forcing magnitude increased further as x decreased on the planar beach compared to that on the barred beach in addition e ω on the barred beach was generally smaller than that on the planar beach considering the maximum values of e ω and corresponding ky the vorticity for the planar bathymetry was more energetic and spatially concentrated than on the barred bathymetry thus more frequent surf zone eddies i e frcs were generated on the planar beach as shown in fig 5e and 5l in turn more sediments were flushed towards the offshore area on the planar beach as shown in fig 6 this implies that the sandbar can protect the beach from erosion by dissipating the wave energy associated with frc generation 4 3 effects of wave height and sediment size fig 9 shows the simulation results with the same d 50 0 247 mm and tw 10 s but different values of ho 0 75 1 0 1 25 m because frcs are closely related to alongshore crest length limited breaking waves directly affected by ho stronger u and ω were generated for a larger ho as shown in fig 9a 9f in turn stronger frcs produced higher hc by following the processes in fig 7 as shown in fig 9g 9i and discussed above eventually h u b c the spatiotemporal average value of the product of hc and ub became larger for larger ho as shown in fig 10 fig 11 shows the simulation results with the same ho 1 m and tw 10 s but different values of d 50 0 124 0 247 0 371 mm because the magnitude of hc o 0 1 in fig 11 the influence of the horizontal density variation on the flow motions is negligible thus the ω of the three flow fields in fig 11a 11c decreased similarly with each other in proportion to x because ω decayed by drag from bottom friction and turbulent viscosity dependent on the flow characteristics although the flow characteristics were the same the hc of the larger sediments decayed more rapidly in proportion to x than that of the smaller sediments as shown in fig 11 d f since the only difference among the three simulations is the d 50 values we can see that the differences of the cross shore distributions of hc result from the difference of the d 50 values as appeared in equation for the sediment particle settling velocity ws included in the deposition rate equation de ws is proportional to d 50 in the three simulations the ws of d 50 0 371 mm and 0 247 mm are 5 5 and 3 3 times larger than the ws of d 50 0 124 mm in turn the deposition rates of the larger sediments increase more effectively as a result the h u b c of the smaller size sediments became larger than that of large size sediments in the same flow fields as shown in figure 11g fig 10 and 11g and fig s2 also show that there are up tp o 10 times differences between the h u b c with and without frcs which indicates that frcs can accelerate suspended sediment flushing under a relative variety of conditions at least in the depth integrated modeling framework therefore although verification is required through physical experiments if we conducted two physical experiments with the same setup same uniform wave height normal incident angle sediment properties and alongshore uniform bottom geometry in horizontal one dimensional channels where frcs are not generated and a two dimensional basin where frcs occur then different sediment transport results would be found in terms of quality and quantity 4 4 importance of local hydrodynamics from the observation of the decay process and decreasing flux quantity in proportion to x it is questionable how and from where the suspended sediment particles beyond the surf zone came for example did the mushroom like sediment plume in fig 11e originate in the swash zone and then travel to the outside of the surf zone or was it picked up around there by the local flow to investigate this we simulated the same setup with er x xb 0 and er x xb 0 on the planar beach with ho 1 m tw 10 s and d 50 0 247 mm thus erosion occurred only for x xb and x xb in the former and latter cases respectively considering er x xb 0 the suspended sediments at x xb in fig 12a were advected by the frc from inside the surf zone however the suspended sediments beyond xb were deposited quickly and did not travel far hence the suspended sediment plumes at x xb in figs 5 9 and 11 were partially supplied through local area erosion beyond xb fig 12b shows the case with er x xb 0 where suspended sediment plumes could be easily found although the sediments were not supplied from the inside of the surf zone thus we can deduce that the processes of advection erosion and deposition occur progressively towards the offshore direction by following the movement of frcs as shown in figs 7 and 12d and these progressive processes carry sediments seaward therefore it is important to accurately predict not only the wave properties but also the local hydrodynamics that cause erosion and advection 4 5 nondispersive and hydrostatic modeling results to investigate the effect of nonhydrostatic pressure and frequency dispersion on frc driven sediment transport we compared the simulation results of the boussinesq type equation model considering nonhydrostatic pressure and dispersion to the results of the shallow water equation model excluding these physical processes this comparison is important because in terms of theory those physical differences between the two models are critical for wave shoaling refraction and breaking which are ultimately related to sediment transport processes as noted in the above sections in addition shallow water equation based morphodynamic modeling is popular in engineering applications but various uncertainties still remain by neglecting the higher order terms h t h c and h m other than the bottom friction and turbulent viscosity terms the boussinesq type equation in section 2 1 becomes a shallow water equation considering horizontal density variation this shallow water equation based sediment transport model was solved by the same numerical schemes as for the boussinesq type equation model i e the fourth order accurate finite volume method using the hllc approximate riemann solver fig 13a 13f show the patterns of u hc and ω computed by the shallow water equation based model with ho 1 m tw 10 s and d 50 0 247 mm compared to the results considering the nonhydrostatic pressure and dispersion much weaker u and ω and low hc values were observed as a result a much smaller amount of suspended sediments were flushed out of the surf zone than when nonhydrostatic pressure and dispersion were considered as shown in fig 13g and 13h therefore to accurately predict suspended sediment transport in nearshore areas it is necessary to properly consider the nonhydrostatic pressure and frequency dispersion without them it will be difficult to consider the two dimensionality of flow and transport such as the alongshore convergence murray 2004 which is closely related to refraction and crest length limited breaking although it still requires excessive model tuning we can partially consider the short wave effects on nearshore flows as noted in the introduction by employing radiation stress a full understanding of the link between short wave effects such as nonhydrostatic pressure and frc driven sediment transport will be able to improve the prediction ability of various sediment transport prediction models by reducing the uncertainties in model parameters the boussinesq type equation used in this study is based on kim et al 2009 which is derived using a perturbation approach with a long wave scale parameter μ the high order terms related to the dispersion and nonhydrostatic pressure equally have the same scale μ2 therefore if we ignore the μ2 scale terms then the boussinesq type equation becomes shallow water equations for non dispersive and hydrostatic flows if we consider μ2 scale terms then both dispersion and nonhydrostatic pressure terms remain in the boussinesq type equation together the derivation of new boussinesq type equations considering separately the nonhydrostatic pressure and dispersion will be appreciable but it is beyond of this study 5 conclusions the major findings obtained from the depth integrated numerical modeling considering non hydrostatic pressure and frequency dispersion and analysis using normal incoming uniform waves on two real field scale uniform bathymetries can be summarized as follows 1 frcs can significantly amplify suspended sediment concentration and transport beyond the surf zone even in accretive wave environments frcs can increase seaward sediment flux by up to o 102 times at least under the tested conditions therefore not only one dimensional cross shore wave and flow properties but also frcs including both cross and alongshore direction waves and current properties must be considered for accurate sediment transport predictions in nearshore areas it should be noted that although the proposed numerical simulations may not be representative of general real world cases the simulated results and analyses demonstrate the potential of the proposed amplification processes to occur occasionally in the real world understanding this process will be helpful in decreasing the uncertainty related to sediment transport quantity and direction in nearshore areas 2 the simulation results confirm the necessity of non hydrostatic pressure and wave dispersion effects to accurately reproduce frc driven suspended sediment transport without these factors frc generation which are closely related to wave refraction and breaking cannot be predicted accurately eventually the quantity of suspended sediment flushing can be significantly underestimated although we simulated the frc driven sediment transport processes with only the boussinesq type equation and sediment transport models proposed by kim 2015 and kim et al 2009 2017 other wave resolving three dimensional and depth integrated models considering nonhydrostatic pressure and frequency dispersion may result in the same conclusions 3 frcs progressively transport sediments because sediment density inhibits suspended sediment particles from traveling away sediments supplied by local erosion amplified by frcs play an important role in suspended sediment transport processes therefore it is important to accurately predict not only statistical wave and flow properties but also local hydrodynamics that cause erosion and advection this accurate local hydrodynamic information can be obtained only when we consider nonhydrostatic pressure and dispersive effects with wave resolving modeling approaches which is a main deficiency of the conventional phase averaged modeling approaches for frc driven sediment transport prediction 4 sandbars can protect beaches from erosion and trap sediments between the shoreline and sandbar spatiotemporal average wise even when an frc occurs by dissipating wave energy associated with frc generation the following limitations of these conclusions are clear first nearshore flow and sediment transport are three dimensional processes in the present depth integrated framework the vertical motions of water flow and sediment are simply modeled instead of being resolved thus the effects of the bursting phenomena generated from the bottom boundary layer heathershaw and thorne 1985 and surface wave breaking scott et al 2006 were not explicitly considered in this study second we tested various idealized conditions such as non cohesive sediment spatially uniform sediment size limited wave conditions and uniform beach bathymetry using a numerical model various other physical parameters such as bottom topography must also be investigated for example frc prevalence decreases with increasing bottom slope murray et al 2003 other types of sediment transport processes like bedload driven by frc remain unknown therefore it is necessary to verify the presented results and conclusions using large scale laboratory experiments or field observations however as noted above it will be very difficult to measure frcs and related sediment concentrations together due to their spatiotemporally transient nature although various physical processes in nature can be represented in physical experiments using distorted or undistorted scale models fundamental parameters such as wave height wave length water depth and orbital and flow velocities in horizontal two dimensional physical models are generally much smaller than those seen in nature in horizontal one dimensional physical models the scale problem with the fundamental parameters can be removed but frcs are not generated in these models considering these difficulties in one and two dimensional physical models it will be difficult to conduct physical model experiments properly representing frc characteristics and frc driven sediment transport without scale problems it should be noted that this study emphasized not the calibration of several parameters to improve model performance but on the change i e potential amplification of suspended sediment flux by frcs currently few existing models can predict full physical processes in surf zones and none of them is sufficiently reliable for engineering purposes without parameter calibration mancini et al 2020 therefore for generalization various wave bathymetry and sediment conditions must be tested after verification by measurements this will improve the understanding of frc driven sediment transport mechanisms and associated prediction skills by reducing excessive model tuning credit authorship

256,climate change has a significant impact on the runoff of basins in cold dry areas the quantification of regional ecohydrological responses to climate change such as warming and drought is essential for establishing proper water resource management schemes we propose a simple and novel method based on the budyko framework to evaluate the hydrologic resilience of 16 basins that conform the asian water tower in the tibetan plateau tp our method defines two metrics within the budyko domain tolerance ψ and plasticity φ that characterize the hydrologic resilience of a basin based on an ecohydrological point of view a basin is considered hydrologically resilient if ψ and φ are both greater than 1 or its φ is negative and ψ is greater than 1 our results show that ψ varies between 0 27 and 0 74 with an average value of 0 45 and φ varies between 2 and 16 33 with an average value of 6 90 for 14 out of the 16 basins only two basins taohe and datonghe had negative φ 11 67 and 8 11 respectively and ψ greater than 1 2 26 and 19 58 respectively suggesting that these two are the only basins with a hydrologic resilience to climatic warming drying in the tp within the non resilient basins we found vegetation to play a key role in the level of tolerance and plasticity indicating that basins with a larger vegetation cover display a lower capability to adapt to adverse climatic changes following these results we call for afforestation efforts to be carefully considered in cold dry areas the proposed method and conclusions drawn by this study may help predict the hydrologic responses to future adverse climatic conditions keywords asian water tower climate change basin hydrologic resilience tolerance plasticity tibetan plateau 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp and its surrounding regions also known as the asian water tower are the origin of many large rivers in east asia previous studies showed that the average temperature of the tp has been increasing faster than the global average immerzeel et al 2010 yang et al 2014 yao et al 2019 adverse climatic changes that include warming and or reductions in precipitation amounts strongly influence the ecohydrological processes and surface energy exchange on the plateau yang et al 2011 for example many studies have shown that warming has led to runoff increase over the past several decades owing to the thawing of permafrost and melting of glaciers immerzeel et al 2019 pan et al 2017 yang et al 2011 warming also affects tp ecosystems through changing the biophysical and phenological characteristics of these ecosystem which in turn influence the basin water balance gao et al 2016 klein et al 2004 piao et al 2011 2012 qin et al 2014 shen et al 2015 understanding the impacts of climate change on ecohydrological processes is essential for accurate prediction of water yield wy which is the remaining water in the ecosystem after loss to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration wang et al 2017 xue et al 2013a b the wy of a basin is important for sustaining ecosystems and people a better understanding of how the wy of basins responds to future climate change has implications for informing adaptation and mitigation strategies one proposed method to study the impacts of climate change on the hydrological balance of basins or ecosystems is through the use of the budyko framework budyko 1974 the budyko curve b relates the evaporative index ei ratio of evapotranspiration e to precipitation p to its dryness index di ratio of potential e ep to p for energy limited di 1 and water limited di 1 basins or sites where ei and di represent the water supply and atmospheric demand according to the budyko framework different vegetation dominated basins can be plotted within the budyko space with their ei and di typically falling around the budyko curve though some exceptions do exist budyko 1974 yang et al 2007 zhang et al 2001 a large deviation from the budyko curve may indicate impacts of the functional vegetation type that dominates the basin area li et al 2013 zhang et al 2001 land use change carmona et al 2014 liang et al 2015 or other unsteady conditions du et al 2016 in addition to the influence of the climatic change the budyko framework has been successfully used at not only basin levels but also the site level williams et al 2012 yang et al 2007 in this context the two concepts of resistance and elasticity have been adopted from the field of ecology and used to describe the functional properties of basins within the budyko framework creed et al 2014 helman et al 2017 resistance is a measure of the change in the ei following a climatic disruption relative to a theoretical expectation derived from the budyko curve budyko 1974 while elasticity measures the ability of a basin to maintain its natural ability of partitioning p into e and wy following a climatic perturbation carey et al 2010 creed et al 2014 these definitions of resistance and elasticity are based on the budyko framework which relates the long term e and wy of a basin to its precipitation and ep at steady state conditions i e at a long term period in which changes in water storage are assumed to be negligible using the ecological concepts of resistance and elasticity creed et al 2014 derived two budyko metrics namely resistance d and elasticity e to describe basin responses to warming they argued that a resilient basin has a small d and large e 1 in other words a basin is very resistant to drought if it has a d close to zero and it is elastic if its ei changes only slightly relative to a substantial change in di these definitions of ecohydrological resistance and elasticity imply that the wy may not be stable per se even if the basin has high resistance and elasticity instead wy can be better predicted using the budyko curve the two budyko metrics have been successfully used at the site and basin levels to investigate the ecosystem and basin hydrological resilience for various climates creed et al 2014 helman et al 2017 sinha et al 2018 creed et al 2014 found that climate warming strongly affected the resilience and therefore the wy across north america and argued that the forest type was responsible for the elasticity or inelasticity of a specific basin moreover they found that coniferous and deciduous basins were less resilient and susceptible to climate warming in contrast helman et al 2017 investigated the site level resistance and resilience to droughts of forests located along a mediterranean precipitation gradient using the budyko method they found that all forests had high elasticity and therefore more predictable wy helman et al 2017 also argued that a drier climate may induce higher resilience than a more humid climate which may be attributed to the adaptation of the vegetation to the local climate the method proposed by creed et al 2014 is useful and practical for evaluating the climate change effects on the ecosystem responses in areas with moderate climates however this method may be biased toward extremely dry or wet areas for example in very dry and cold areas the ei may change little despite the relatively large di changes with small dynamic deviation and thus high resistance in mathematical terms owing to precipitation limitations in fact this does not necessarily indicate high ecosystem resistance because low dynamic resistance is mainly caused by background climate namely limited precipitation thus a simple evaluation method that can be used for all climates is necessary for understanding ecosystem responses to climate warming here we adopted the ecological elasticity concept to assess the hydrological resilience of the major asian water tower basins and its surroundings these basins were selected because they experience relatively intense warming but have little human interference which allowed us to isolate effects of climate change on the hydrological system from those of anthropogenic activities e g land cover and land use effects e g creed et al 2014 helman et al 2017 in detail we developed two new quantitative metrics based on the budyko framework the hydrologic tolerance ψ and plasticity φ the ψ is defined as the ratio of a theoretical ei displacement eitheoretical to that of the actual observed value eiactual it always quantifies the hydrological shock experienced by the system basin following a climatic change the φ is defined as how much the di changes di compared to the change from eiactual to eitheoretical it is assumed that while φ is positive the larger the φ value the higher is the hydrological plasticity and hydrologic resilience of the basin to climatic change by definition a basin with a negative φ will be resilient to climatic change especially if its ψ is greater than 1 we tested these metrics in 16 major basins on the tp and its surroundings after selecting two periods one with the largest di and the other with the smallest di i e wetter cooler and drier warmer periods representing favorable and adverse climate conditions respectively specifically we asked the following three questions 1 can the proposed new metrics be used to detect and evaluate the resilience of basins in dry regions 2 are the basins in the asian water tower hydrologically resilient to adverse climate conditions warming drying 3 what are the main factors controlling the resilience of these basins 2 theory and data 2 1 budyko framework the budyko framework estimates the long term wy based on the dry index di ep p and evaporative index ei e p choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 1 e p e p p n e p n 1 n where n is a factor that depends on the basin characteristics e g soil properties topographic slope vegetation cover yang et al 2008 eq 1 is obtained following the assumption that the change in water storage s is negligible under steady state conditions i e for a period of multiple years recent studies showed that in some basins especially in arid and semi arid ones the steady state assumption is violated even for a long period of several years han et al 2020 because some of the basins in our study region are likely to violate the steady state assumption we accounted for the annual s to solve the water balance the s was adopted from the reconstructed gravity recovery and climate experiment grace rec data which is a reconstructed time series of monthly anomalies of water storage in mm based on the available data from grace during 2002 2007 and past meteorological forcing datasets humphrey et al 2019 padrón et al 2020 the reconstruction of the data is based on statistical models trained with grace observations and then extended backward to 1901 since grace rec data provide monthly anomalies we calculated the annual value as the difference between the last months of every two consecutive years i e december annual e was then calculated as e p r s where p and r are annual precipitation and runoff respectively because of the coarse resolution of grace rec 0 5 0 5 approximately 50 km compared with the relatively small areas of some of the basins see below and possible contributions from other sources such as glacier melting and permafrost thawing there were still uncertainties for the calculated e e g scanlon et al 2016 tapley et al 2019 wang et al 2018 therefore we further validated the e from the water balance method with that from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam results miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 our validation results show close relationship between our calculated e and that from gleam for all the basins or the smaller ones 10 000 km2 which partly verified the applicability of the budyko method on the tp figure s1 yang et al 2011 wang et al 2018 by definition we expect ei and di to follow the budyko curve eq 1 following a climatic change in contrast we expect ei and di in non resilient basins to largely deviate from the curve following the climatic change fig 1 a 2 2 the newly proposed budyko metrics tolerance and plasticity in most cases the long term ei for a certain basin may not be located on the budyko curve eq 1 in our case and the vertical deviation of ei can be divided into two parts 1 the static deviation eis which is the basin s inherent displacement from the curve and 2 the climate warming induced deviation ei w which is the deviation beyond the inherent deviation during the warming period since eis exist both before and after climate warming this part is neglected in the following analysis creed et al 2014 for different climate regions the ei w for unit changes in di may be different fig 1a that is ei w is larger for wet regions energy limited and smaller for dry regions precipitation limited for a certain basin subjected to a long period of dry warm conditions five years in our case we define the ratio of a theoretical ei displacement following the curve δeitheoretical to that of the actual observed displacement eiactual as the hydrologic tolerance ψ of the basin 2 ψ δ e i t h e o r e c t i c a l δ e i a c t u a l where δeiactual is the calculated difference in ei prior eic and following eiw the climatic change eiw eic while δeitheoretical is the expected difference in ei following the budyko curve bw bc fig 1 thus a basin with a large eitheoretical to eiactual ratio ψ 1 will gain more water yield than predicted from the budyko curve while a basin with a small ratio ψ 1 will lose more water yield than predicted hence a more hydrological tolerant basin will tend to have a higher ψ than one for each basin a five year moving average di time series was calculated then the warm and cool periods were defined as five consecutive years with the largest and the smallest di values during the entire period of our data following creed et al 2014 and helman et al 2017 further the selection of the 5 year period with a high di instead of the warmest e g creed et al 2014 or a drought e g helman et al 2017 year alone allowed us to include both drought and warm years which is usually observed in cold and dry areas liu and chen 2000 kang et al 2010 and are more representative of adverse climate change note that the five year period will not necessarily ensure the steady state assumption and thus s from reconstructed grace humphrey et al 2019 padrón et al 2020 was used to close the water balance next we define the hydrologic plasticity φ of a basin as the ratio of change in di di to that of the difference between eiactual and eitheoretical fig 1 3 φ δ d i δ e i a c t u a l δ e i t h e o r e t i c a l in theory φ describes the relative intensity of the ei to the di change following a climatic drying warming compared to the theoretical budyko framework which describes expected changes of basins or ecosystems under steady state conditions in practice a basin with a larger φ would indicate a smaller ei change than expected for a certain di adverse climatic change with a water surplus in the system more water yield such a water yield surplus means that the basin loses less water than expected from a basin under steady state conditions therefore we can refer to φ as the basin s hydrologic plasticity in terms of its response to adverse climatic drying warming changes a basin with a negative φ would have high plasticity to adverse changes because the actual ei displacement is smaller than predicted basins with positive φ values i e eiactual eitheorical where di is above 0 would have less plasticity than those with negative φ because by definition the actual ei was less than the predicted by the budyko curve for the positive φ a basin with plasticity greater than 1 is capable to return to its pre climate change steady state hydrological condition in contrast a basin with a smaller plasticity than 1 0 φ 1 is unable to return to its pre change condition we consider a basin with both tolerance and plasticity larger than 1 ψ 1 and φ 1 as hydrologically resilient 2 3 data for calculating resistance and plasticity overall sixteen basins from the tp were selected to test our method table 1 and fig 2 these basins generally underwent rapid climate warming and occasionally drought owing to the high altitude but had low anthropogenic influences owing to their remote locations the basins are mainly occupied by grasslands according to the global moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land use map friedl et al 2010 mod12q1 the leaf area index lai characterizing the vegetation of each basin was obtained from the global land surface satellite glass project and was averaged over the study period the glass lai is a global eight day composite product with a spatial resolution of 0 05 since 1982 it was generated with surface reflectance data from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr and modis using general regression neural networks xiao et al 2014 we preferred glass lai product over vegetation index products e g normalized difference vegetation index because of its biophysical meaning and proven reliability in this region jin et al 2017 xiao et al 2014 in the budyko method the meteorological data used to derive ei and di including the precipitation p mm and temperature t c were obtained from the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration cma the p and t data were spatially interpolated using the thin plate spline method from 2400 ground stations to generate gridded monthly data sets with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 across the mainland china li et al 2014 the data covering each investigated period for the twenty basins are available online and can be downloaded free of charge http cdc cma gov cn home do moreover ep can be calculated using the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 as follows e p α δ r n λ δ γ where λ is the latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 rn is the net radiation mj m 2 day 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 and α is an empirical parameter 1 26 because the rn values are not available in the cma datasets these values were obtained from the global land data assimilation system with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 approximately 25 km rodell et al 2004 finally the observed discharge r for different hydrological stations was obtained from the hydrological yearbooks which are published by the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 3 results fig 3 presents the budyko curves for the sixteen basins the relatively close fit to budyko and the apparent small to null water surplus e p 1 indicate that the steady state assumption i e neglectable change in water storage was maintained for these basins the range in di varied substantially with the largest di range δdi being 0 46 and the smallest 0 11 table 1 reflecting different levels of adverse climatic conditions among the basins the apparent difference in magnitude also indicates that the basins differed in evaporative demand conditions all basins exhibited small variation in ei and had relatively large di changes absolute value of φ is larger than 1 following the climatic change the n parameter which is the parameter adjustment for specific vegetation types and structures varied among the basins through positive linear relationships with both lai and e fig 4 likely reflecting the well known positive effect of lai on plant transpiration and evaporation ψ varied within the range of 0 27 and 19 58 and had an average value of 1 76 while φ was between 11 67 and 16 33 with an average value of 4 80 table 1 only two of the sixteen basins datonghe and taohe had ψ greater than 1 likely indicating higher ecohydrological tolerance to adverse climate changes and high plasticity φ was 8 11 and 11 67 for datonghe and taohe respectively except datonghe and taohe all other basins had ψ 1 table 1 meaning low resilience to warming drought next we excluded datonghe and taohe from the analysis because both had negative φ and substantially larger ψ than the other 14 basins the remaining non resilient basins showed a negative correlation between lai and both ψ and φ fig 5 r 0 55 p 0 05 and r 0 56 p 0 05 respectively indicating the important role of the vegetation in determining the hydrological tolerance and plasticity of tp s non resilient basins the plasticity φ of the basins was linearly related to the hydrologic tolerance ψ excluding the only two basins that showed high plasticity and ψ 1 r 0 91 p 0 001 fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 physical meaning of the two budyko metrics in this study two metrics hydrologic tolerance ψ and plasticity φ were derived from our improved budyko framework ψ is the ratio of theoretical and actual changes in ei by the basin in response to climate change we assume that the ei changes solely induced by climate change eiw can be predicted using the budyko framework that is the wy runoff can be predicted fig 1 for a specific basin the actual ei may deviate from the budyko estimation typically owing to the ecosystems creed et al 2014 helman et al 2017 thus ψ can measure this deviation from a theoretical ei and can reflect to what extent the basin is tolerant to climate change this value is different from the dynamic deviation d of creed et al 2014 in that d inherently assumes that the ei changes in the two periods cool and warm solely induced by climate change are the same among different sites although this is not the case for example for basins located in dry areas the ei changes were much smaller than those in wet areas for a unit change of di note the smaller derivative as di increases for the budyko curve this may result in a smaller change in d which may not be necessarily attributed to the basin resistance but rather to the low amount of precipitation for evapotranspiration compared with wet areas therefore d may be not an appropriate measure of resistance to climate change for different sites or basins with contrasting background climates similarly the relative changes in ei were always much smaller in dry areas than in wet areas for the same change in di therefore to compare the relative changes of ei ei and di di for basins with contrasting local climates the ei changes solely induced by the background climate wet or dry should first be eliminated eq 3 since the research periods for the basins generally cover several decades the five year average di and ei between the cool and warm periods were used to derive the plasticity φ as adopted in creed et al 2014 while the physical meanings of the two metrics are different from the approach used by creed et al 2014 therefore by combining the two metrics our proposed method can be used for different basins with contrasting climate conditions whereas the metrics proposed by creed et al 2014 may be more suitable for basins under the same climate conditions 4 2 resilience of the tibetan plateau the vulnerability of runoff in mountainous or high latitude regions such as the tp to climate change has been widely recognized goulden and bales 2014 immerzeel et al 2010 a quantitative method for evaluating this regional vulnerability or resilience to climate change is necessary and timely considering that regions with high elevations are expected to undergo faster temperature increase according to current climate projections we proposed a simple method for evaluating basin scale resilience to climate change based on the hydrologic tolerance ψ and plasticity φ derived using the budyko method according to our results only two of the 16 basins on the tp the datonghe river and taohe river basins exhibited climate change resilience with large ψ value and φ value higher than one table 1 the vulnerability of basins on the tp indicates that caution should be exercised in these regions to ensure more sustainable water resource management in the future climate change particularly climate warming and or increasing drought substantially enhances the overall vegetation growth and productivity on the tp yang et al 2009 piao et al 2012 however the large spatial variances are more pronounced in the eastern and south western parts of the plateau and a decreasing trend has been observed for the northern and three river sources regions piao et al 2011 yao et al 2018 in fact many previous studies have shown that permafrost and above steppe ecosystems have degraded owing to climate warming miehe et al 2019 wang et al 2008 yang et al 2010 the increased temperature and lower soil water content caused by the degradation of permafrost may have lowered the species diversity and productivity which may impact ecosystem functioning klein et al 2004 yang et al 2018 in contrast the two basins i e datonghe and taohe basins located at the northeastern edge of the tp fig 2 showed a relatively high resilience to climate change table 1 previous studies indicate that resilient basins may have a totally different response to climatic and or vegetation drivers compared to non resilient basins with sometimes even no clear response at all e g creed et al 2014 helman et al 2017 one possible explanation for the high resilience of these basins may be the observed decline in ep and increase in p in the northeastern tp chen et al 2006 yang et al 2014 the availability of new hydrologic data might provide in the future a clearer view of the resilient characteristics of these basins our study found that vegetation had significant effects on basin characteristics n and hydrologic resilience figs 4 and 5 according to yang et al 2008 the parameter n in eq 1 represents the catchment characteristics over a long time period the basin slope and dem may not change much and therefore the vegetation changes may be the major determinant factor of basin characteristics our result show that the basins covered by forests had larger n and that lai had a close positive relationship with n values for all these 16 basins fig 4 this close n lai relationship shows that the vegetation plays an essential role in characterizing the hydrological response of these cold dry basins likely through the partitioning of precipitation into runoff and e this is also verified by the close coupling of tolerance and plasticity of the non resilience basins in tp the close relationship between the two metrics indicates that a basin with a large tolerance tends to be also more plastic the same close relationship was also observed in other dry and wet regions creed et al 2014 helman et al 2017 xue et al 2020 it has been assumed that the close relationship between ψ and φ is partly due to eco physiological adjustments via self acclimation and enhanced water use efficiency of the vegetation under adverse climate conditions creed et al 2014 xue et al 2020 actually according to our definitions of ψ and φ eq 3 the resilience of a specific basin was largely dependent on the ei determined by the basin characteristics mainly by the vegetation a more resilient basin in dry areas tended to have a lower amount of vegetation e which resulted in a more predictable wy fig 1 and eq 2 the close negative relationships between lai and ψ or φ fig 5 indicates that basins with larger lai and thus larger e were more vulnerable to climate warming and or drought at least for these dry areas this was different from basins in wet areas which were more responsive to precipitation owing to the relatively constant e demand and increased runoff always existed owing to the higher amount of precipitation 4 3 implications and limitations the vegetation greening in china has drawn growing attention in recent years tong et al 2018 chen et al 2019 the forest areas have been much enlarged in china due to the ecological projects such as grain for green and the three north belt program these afforestation projects have mitigated environmental problems via improving ecosystem services and also have significant hydrologic and biophysical feedbacks xiao 2014 peng et al 2014 for example a significant cooling effect and changes in water yield have been found based on modeling and in situ and or remote sensing observations e g peng et al 2014 liu et al 2016 however some studies also argued that the afforestation especially in the dry areas may also elevate e and thus intensify the local drought or water shortage cao 2008 wu et al 2014 liang et al 2018 our results partly support this by showing that basins with larger lai are less tolerant and thus may not easily adapt to climate changes such as frequent droughts in the near future the reason is likely due to water limitation and thus a greater sensitivity to even small changes in vegetation cover through significant changes in e these results suggest that caution should be taken when considering afforestation in this area because such increase in tree cover could increase the vulnerability of the basin to future climate change on the other hand besides lai other factors such as topography e g altitude slope could possibly influence the tolerance and plasticity of non resilient basins e g helman et al 2017 therefore influences of such factors should be also taken into account in future analyses indeed the relatively weak relationship between lai and ψ fig 5 especially when lai is large suggests that other unexplored factors may be involved in shaping the tolerance of a catchment in the tp as such further research should focus on basins covering various climate conditions topographic features and vegetation types to fully explore what regulates hydrologic resilience to climate change following creed et al 2014 and helman et al 2017 we neglected the interannual changes in the basin characteristics i e n in eq 1 uncertainties may arise from the assumption in both our research and two previous studies creed et al 2014 helman et al 2017 even though they used another form of the budyko equation parameter ω in the zhang model in fact besides human activities many other factors could lead to changes in n including changes in precipitation seasonality the snowfall proportion for cold catchments vegetation co2 concentration and glacial and snow cover melt e g woods 2003 donohue et al 2012 yang et al 2014 to deal with this we selected basins on the tibetan plateau with a minor human cuo et al 2013 the climate seasonality such as the precipitation seasonal changes and snowmelt among these years may also change the parameter n e g woods 2003 we only focused on the interannual scale and therefore climate change influences from the seasonality were not considered 5 conclusions climate change may have a significant impact on the runoff of basins in the tp the quantification of regional ecosystem responses to climate change such as warming and drying is essential for evaluating the climatic effects on water yield and can thus inform water resources management we proposed a simple and novel method based on the budyko framework to evaluate the hydrologic resilience of basins on the tp we found that most basins on the plateau had low hydrologic resilience indicating that these basins surrounding tp had a high vulnerability to climatic warming drying additionally we found that vegetation plays an essential role in determining the hydrological resilience of tp s basins particularly in non resilient basins the small resilience of such basins which decreases even more with the increase in lai suggets that afforestation efforts should be carefully considered in these areas our proposed method and findings may help predict the vegetation responses to future climate warming credit authorship contribution

256,climate change has a significant impact on the runoff of basins in cold dry areas the quantification of regional ecohydrological responses to climate change such as warming and drought is essential for establishing proper water resource management schemes we propose a simple and novel method based on the budyko framework to evaluate the hydrologic resilience of 16 basins that conform the asian water tower in the tibetan plateau tp our method defines two metrics within the budyko domain tolerance ψ and plasticity φ that characterize the hydrologic resilience of a basin based on an ecohydrological point of view a basin is considered hydrologically resilient if ψ and φ are both greater than 1 or its φ is negative and ψ is greater than 1 our results show that ψ varies between 0 27 and 0 74 with an average value of 0 45 and φ varies between 2 and 16 33 with an average value of 6 90 for 14 out of the 16 basins only two basins taohe and datonghe had negative φ 11 67 and 8 11 respectively and ψ greater than 1 2 26 and 19 58 respectively suggesting that these two are the only basins with a hydrologic resilience to climatic warming drying in the tp within the non resilient basins we found vegetation to play a key role in the level of tolerance and plasticity indicating that basins with a larger vegetation cover display a lower capability to adapt to adverse climatic changes following these results we call for afforestation efforts to be carefully considered in cold dry areas the proposed method and conclusions drawn by this study may help predict the hydrologic responses to future adverse climatic conditions keywords asian water tower climate change basin hydrologic resilience tolerance plasticity tibetan plateau 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp and its surrounding regions also known as the asian water tower are the origin of many large rivers in east asia previous studies showed that the average temperature of the tp has been increasing faster than the global average immerzeel et al 2010 yang et al 2014 yao et al 2019 adverse climatic changes that include warming and or reductions in precipitation amounts strongly influence the ecohydrological processes and surface energy exchange on the plateau yang et al 2011 for example many studies have shown that warming has led to runoff increase over the past several decades owing to the thawing of permafrost and melting of glaciers immerzeel et al 2019 pan et al 2017 yang et al 2011 warming also affects tp ecosystems through changing the biophysical and phenological characteristics of these ecosystem which in turn influence the basin water balance gao et al 2016 klein et al 2004 piao et al 2011 2012 qin et al 2014 shen et al 2015 understanding the impacts of climate change on ecohydrological processes is essential for accurate prediction of water yield wy which is the remaining water in the ecosystem after loss to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration wang et al 2017 xue et al 2013a b the wy of a basin is important for sustaining ecosystems and people a better understanding of how the wy of basins responds to future climate change has implications for informing adaptation and mitigation strategies one proposed method to study the impacts of climate change on the hydrological balance of basins or ecosystems is through the use of the budyko framework budyko 1974 the budyko curve b relates the evaporative index ei ratio of evapotranspiration e to precipitation p to its dryness index di ratio of potential e ep to p for energy limited di 1 and water limited di 1 basins or sites where ei and di represent the water supply and atmospheric demand according to the budyko framework different vegetation dominated basins can be plotted within the budyko space with their ei and di typically falling around the budyko curve though some exceptions do exist budyko 1974 yang et al 2007 zhang et al 2001 a large deviation from the budyko curve may indicate impacts of the functional vegetation type that dominates the basin area li et al 2013 zhang et al 2001 land use change carmona et al 2014 liang et al 2015 or other unsteady conditions du et al 2016 in addition to the influence of the climatic change the budyko framework has been successfully used at not only basin levels but also the site level williams et al 2012 yang et al 2007 in this context the two concepts of resistance and elasticity have been adopted from the field of ecology and used to describe the functional properties of basins within the budyko framework creed et al 2014 helman et al 2017 resistance is a measure of the change in the ei following a climatic disruption relative to a theoretical expectation derived from the budyko curve budyko 1974 while elasticity measures the ability of a basin to maintain its natural ability of partitioning p into e and wy following a climatic perturbation carey et al 2010 creed et al 2014 these definitions of resistance and elasticity are based on the budyko framework which relates the long term e and wy of a basin to its precipitation and ep at steady state conditions i e at a long term period in which changes in water storage are assumed to be negligible using the ecological concepts of resistance and elasticity creed et al 2014 derived two budyko metrics namely resistance d and elasticity e to describe basin responses to warming they argued that a resilient basin has a small d and large e 1 in other words a basin is very resistant to drought if it has a d close to zero and it is elastic if its ei changes only slightly relative to a substantial change in di these definitions of ecohydrological resistance and elasticity imply that the wy may not be stable per se even if the basin has high resistance and elasticity instead wy can be better predicted using the budyko curve the two budyko metrics have been successfully used at the site and basin levels to investigate the ecosystem and basin hydrological resilience for various climates creed et al 2014 helman et al 2017 sinha et al 2018 creed et al 2014 found that climate warming strongly affected the resilience and therefore the wy across north america and argued that the forest type was responsible for the elasticity or inelasticity of a specific basin moreover they found that coniferous and deciduous basins were less resilient and susceptible to climate warming in contrast helman et al 2017 investigated the site level resistance and resilience to droughts of forests located along a mediterranean precipitation gradient using the budyko method they found that all forests had high elasticity and therefore more predictable wy helman et al 2017 also argued that a drier climate may induce higher resilience than a more humid climate which may be attributed to the adaptation of the vegetation to the local climate the method proposed by creed et al 2014 is useful and practical for evaluating the climate change effects on the ecosystem responses in areas with moderate climates however this method may be biased toward extremely dry or wet areas for example in very dry and cold areas the ei may change little despite the relatively large di changes with small dynamic deviation and thus high resistance in mathematical terms owing to precipitation limitations in fact this does not necessarily indicate high ecosystem resistance because low dynamic resistance is mainly caused by background climate namely limited precipitation thus a simple evaluation method that can be used for all climates is necessary for understanding ecosystem responses to climate warming here we adopted the ecological elasticity concept to assess the hydrological resilience of the major asian water tower basins and its surroundings these basins were selected because they experience relatively intense warming but have little human interference which allowed us to isolate effects of climate change on the hydrological system from those of anthropogenic activities e g land cover and land use effects e g creed et al 2014 helman et al 2017 in detail we developed two new quantitative metrics based on the budyko framework the hydrologic tolerance ψ and plasticity φ the ψ is defined as the ratio of a theoretical ei displacement eitheoretical to that of the actual observed value eiactual it always quantifies the hydrological shock experienced by the system basin following a climatic change the φ is defined as how much the di changes di compared to the change from eiactual to eitheoretical it is assumed that while φ is positive the larger the φ value the higher is the hydrological plasticity and hydrologic resilience of the basin to climatic change by definition a basin with a negative φ will be resilient to climatic change especially if its ψ is greater than 1 we tested these metrics in 16 major basins on the tp and its surroundings after selecting two periods one with the largest di and the other with the smallest di i e wetter cooler and drier warmer periods representing favorable and adverse climate conditions respectively specifically we asked the following three questions 1 can the proposed new metrics be used to detect and evaluate the resilience of basins in dry regions 2 are the basins in the asian water tower hydrologically resilient to adverse climate conditions warming drying 3 what are the main factors controlling the resilience of these basins 2 theory and data 2 1 budyko framework the budyko framework estimates the long term wy based on the dry index di ep p and evaporative index ei e p choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 1 e p e p p n e p n 1 n where n is a factor that depends on the basin characteristics e g soil properties topographic slope vegetation cover yang et al 2008 eq 1 is obtained following the assumption that the change in water storage s is negligible under steady state conditions i e for a period of multiple years recent studies showed that in some basins especially in arid and semi arid ones the steady state assumption is violated even for a long period of several years han et al 2020 because some of the basins in our study region are likely to violate the steady state assumption we accounted for the annual s to solve the water balance the s was adopted from the reconstructed gravity recovery and climate experiment grace rec data which is a reconstructed time series of monthly anomalies of water storage in mm based on the available data from grace during 2002 2007 and past meteorological forcing datasets humphrey et al 2019 padrón et al 2020 the reconstruction of the data is based on statistical models trained with grace observations and then extended backward to 1901 since grace rec data provide monthly anomalies we calculated the annual value as the difference between the last months of every two consecutive years i e december annual e was then calculated as e p r s where p and r are annual precipitation and runoff respectively because of the coarse resolution of grace rec 0 5 0 5 approximately 50 km compared with the relatively small areas of some of the basins see below and possible contributions from other sources such as glacier melting and permafrost thawing there were still uncertainties for the calculated e e g scanlon et al 2016 tapley et al 2019 wang et al 2018 therefore we further validated the e from the water balance method with that from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam results miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 our validation results show close relationship between our calculated e and that from gleam for all the basins or the smaller ones 10 000 km2 which partly verified the applicability of the budyko method on the tp figure s1 yang et al 2011 wang et al 2018 by definition we expect ei and di to follow the budyko curve eq 1 following a climatic change in contrast we expect ei and di in non resilient basins to largely deviate from the curve following the climatic change fig 1 a 2 2 the newly proposed budyko metrics tolerance and plasticity in most cases the long term ei for a certain basin may not be located on the budyko curve eq 1 in our case and the vertical deviation of ei can be divided into two parts 1 the static deviation eis which is the basin s inherent displacement from the curve and 2 the climate warming induced deviation ei w which is the deviation beyond the inherent deviation during the warming period since eis exist both before and after climate warming this part is neglected in the following analysis creed et al 2014 for different climate regions the ei w for unit changes in di may be different fig 1a that is ei w is larger for wet regions energy limited and smaller for dry regions precipitation limited for a certain basin subjected to a long period of dry warm conditions five years in our case we define the ratio of a theoretical ei displacement following the curve δeitheoretical to that of the actual observed displacement eiactual as the hydrologic tolerance ψ of the basin 2 ψ δ e i t h e o r e c t i c a l δ e i a c t u a l where δeiactual is the calculated difference in ei prior eic and following eiw the climatic change eiw eic while δeitheoretical is the expected difference in ei following the budyko curve bw bc fig 1 thus a basin with a large eitheoretical to eiactual ratio ψ 1 will gain more water yield than predicted from the budyko curve while a basin with a small ratio ψ 1 will lose more water yield than predicted hence a more hydrological tolerant basin will tend to have a higher ψ than one for each basin a five year moving average di time series was calculated then the warm and cool periods were defined as five consecutive years with the largest and the smallest di values during the entire period of our data following creed et al 2014 and helman et al 2017 further the selection of the 5 year period with a high di instead of the warmest e g creed et al 2014 or a drought e g helman et al 2017 year alone allowed us to include both drought and warm years which is usually observed in cold and dry areas liu and chen 2000 kang et al 2010 and are more representative of adverse climate change note that the five year period will not necessarily ensure the steady state assumption and thus s from reconstructed grace humphrey et al 2019 padrón et al 2020 was used to close the water balance next we define the hydrologic plasticity φ of a basin as the ratio of change in di di to that of the difference between eiactual and eitheoretical fig 1 3 φ δ d i δ e i a c t u a l δ e i t h e o r e t i c a l in theory φ describes the relative intensity of the ei to the di change following a climatic drying warming compared to the theoretical budyko framework which describes expected changes of basins or ecosystems under steady state conditions in practice a basin with a larger φ would indicate a smaller ei change than expected for a certain di adverse climatic change with a water surplus in the system more water yield such a water yield surplus means that the basin loses less water than expected from a basin under steady state conditions therefore we can refer to φ as the basin s hydrologic plasticity in terms of its response to adverse climatic drying warming changes a basin with a negative φ would have high plasticity to adverse changes because the actual ei displacement is smaller than predicted basins with positive φ values i e eiactual eitheorical where di is above 0 would have less plasticity than those with negative φ because by definition the actual ei was less than the predicted by the budyko curve for the positive φ a basin with plasticity greater than 1 is capable to return to its pre climate change steady state hydrological condition in contrast a basin with a smaller plasticity than 1 0 φ 1 is unable to return to its pre change condition we consider a basin with both tolerance and plasticity larger than 1 ψ 1 and φ 1 as hydrologically resilient 2 3 data for calculating resistance and plasticity overall sixteen basins from the tp were selected to test our method table 1 and fig 2 these basins generally underwent rapid climate warming and occasionally drought owing to the high altitude but had low anthropogenic influences owing to their remote locations the basins are mainly occupied by grasslands according to the global moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land use map friedl et al 2010 mod12q1 the leaf area index lai characterizing the vegetation of each basin was obtained from the global land surface satellite glass project and was averaged over the study period the glass lai is a global eight day composite product with a spatial resolution of 0 05 since 1982 it was generated with surface reflectance data from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr and modis using general regression neural networks xiao et al 2014 we preferred glass lai product over vegetation index products e g normalized difference vegetation index because of its biophysical meaning and proven reliability in this region jin et al 2017 xiao et al 2014 in the budyko method the meteorological data used to derive ei and di including the precipitation p mm and temperature t c were obtained from the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration cma the p and t data were spatially interpolated using the thin plate spline method from 2400 ground stations to generate gridded monthly data sets with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 across the mainland china li et al 2014 the data covering each investigated period for the twenty basins are available online and can be downloaded free of charge http cdc cma gov cn home do moreover ep can be calculated using the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 as follows e p α δ r n λ δ γ where λ is the latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 rn is the net radiation mj m 2 day 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 and α is an empirical parameter 1 26 because the rn values are not available in the cma datasets these values were obtained from the global land data assimilation system with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 approximately 25 km rodell et al 2004 finally the observed discharge r for different hydrological stations was obtained from the hydrological yearbooks which are published by the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 3 results fig 3 presents the budyko curves for the sixteen basins the relatively close fit to budyko and the apparent small to null water surplus e p 1 indicate that the steady state assumption i e neglectable change in water storage was maintained for these basins the range in di varied substantially with the largest di range δdi being 0 46 and the smallest 0 11 table 1 reflecting different levels of adverse climatic conditions among the basins the apparent difference in magnitude also indicates that the basins differed in evaporative demand conditions all basins exhibited small variation in ei and had relatively large di changes absolute value of φ is larger than 1 following the climatic change the n parameter which is the parameter adjustment for specific vegetation types and structures varied among the basins through positive linear relationships with both lai and e fig 4 likely reflecting the well known positive effect of lai on plant transpiration and evaporation ψ varied within the range of 0 27 and 19 58 and had an average value of 1 76 while φ was between 11 67 and 16 33 with an average value of 4 80 table 1 only two of the sixteen basins datonghe and taohe had ψ greater than 1 likely indicating higher ecohydrological tolerance to adverse climate changes and high plasticity φ was 8 11 and 11 67 for datonghe and taohe respectively except datonghe and taohe all other basins had ψ 1 table 1 meaning low resilience to warming drought next we excluded datonghe and taohe from the analysis because both had negative φ and substantially larger ψ than the other 14 basins the remaining non resilient basins showed a negative correlation between lai and both ψ and φ fig 5 r 0 55 p 0 05 and r 0 56 p 0 05 respectively indicating the important role of the vegetation in determining the hydrological tolerance and plasticity of tp s non resilient basins the plasticity φ of the basins was linearly related to the hydrologic tolerance ψ excluding the only two basins that showed high plasticity and ψ 1 r 0 91 p 0 001 fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 physical meaning of the two budyko metrics in this study two metrics hydrologic tolerance ψ and plasticity φ were derived from our improved budyko framework ψ is the ratio of theoretical and actual changes in ei by the basin in response to climate change we assume that the ei changes solely induced by climate change eiw can be predicted using the budyko framework that is the wy runoff can be predicted fig 1 for a specific basin the actual ei may deviate from the budyko estimation typically owing to the ecosystems creed et al 2014 helman et al 2017 thus ψ can measure this deviation from a theoretical ei and can reflect to what extent the basin is tolerant to climate change this value is different from the dynamic deviation d of creed et al 2014 in that d inherently assumes that the ei changes in the two periods cool and warm solely induced by climate change are the same among different sites although this is not the case for example for basins located in dry areas the ei changes were much smaller than those in wet areas for a unit change of di note the smaller derivative as di increases for the budyko curve this may result in a smaller change in d which may not be necessarily attributed to the basin resistance but rather to the low amount of precipitation for evapotranspiration compared with wet areas therefore d may be not an appropriate measure of resistance to climate change for different sites or basins with contrasting background climates similarly the relative changes in ei were always much smaller in dry areas than in wet areas for the same change in di therefore to compare the relative changes of ei ei and di di for basins with contrasting local climates the ei changes solely induced by the background climate wet or dry should first be eliminated eq 3 since the research periods for the basins generally cover several decades the five year average di and ei between the cool and warm periods were used to derive the plasticity φ as adopted in creed et al 2014 while the physical meanings of the two metrics are different from the approach used by creed et al 2014 therefore by combining the two metrics our proposed method can be used for different basins with contrasting climate conditions whereas the metrics proposed by creed et al 2014 may be more suitable for basins under the same climate conditions 4 2 resilience of the tibetan plateau the vulnerability of runoff in mountainous or high latitude regions such as the tp to climate change has been widely recognized goulden and bales 2014 immerzeel et al 2010 a quantitative method for evaluating this regional vulnerability or resilience to climate change is necessary and timely considering that regions with high elevations are expected to undergo faster temperature increase according to current climate projections we proposed a simple method for evaluating basin scale resilience to climate change based on the hydrologic tolerance ψ and plasticity φ derived using the budyko method according to our results only two of the 16 basins on the tp the datonghe river and taohe river basins exhibited climate change resilience with large ψ value and φ value higher than one table 1 the vulnerability of basins on the tp indicates that caution should be exercised in these regions to ensure more sustainable water resource management in the future climate change particularly climate warming and or increasing drought substantially enhances the overall vegetation growth and productivity on the tp yang et al 2009 piao et al 2012 however the large spatial variances are more pronounced in the eastern and south western parts of the plateau and a decreasing trend has been observed for the northern and three river sources regions piao et al 2011 yao et al 2018 in fact many previous studies have shown that permafrost and above steppe ecosystems have degraded owing to climate warming miehe et al 2019 wang et al 2008 yang et al 2010 the increased temperature and lower soil water content caused by the degradation of permafrost may have lowered the species diversity and productivity which may impact ecosystem functioning klein et al 2004 yang et al 2018 in contrast the two basins i e datonghe and taohe basins located at the northeastern edge of the tp fig 2 showed a relatively high resilience to climate change table 1 previous studies indicate that resilient basins may have a totally different response to climatic and or vegetation drivers compared to non resilient basins with sometimes even no clear response at all e g creed et al 2014 helman et al 2017 one possible explanation for the high resilience of these basins may be the observed decline in ep and increase in p in the northeastern tp chen et al 2006 yang et al 2014 the availability of new hydrologic data might provide in the future a clearer view of the resilient characteristics of these basins our study found that vegetation had significant effects on basin characteristics n and hydrologic resilience figs 4 and 5 according to yang et al 2008 the parameter n in eq 1 represents the catchment characteristics over a long time period the basin slope and dem may not change much and therefore the vegetation changes may be the major determinant factor of basin characteristics our result show that the basins covered by forests had larger n and that lai had a close positive relationship with n values for all these 16 basins fig 4 this close n lai relationship shows that the vegetation plays an essential role in characterizing the hydrological response of these cold dry basins likely through the partitioning of precipitation into runoff and e this is also verified by the close coupling of tolerance and plasticity of the non resilience basins in tp the close relationship between the two metrics indicates that a basin with a large tolerance tends to be also more plastic the same close relationship was also observed in other dry and wet regions creed et al 2014 helman et al 2017 xue et al 2020 it has been assumed that the close relationship between ψ and φ is partly due to eco physiological adjustments via self acclimation and enhanced water use efficiency of the vegetation under adverse climate conditions creed et al 2014 xue et al 2020 actually according to our definitions of ψ and φ eq 3 the resilience of a specific basin was largely dependent on the ei determined by the basin characteristics mainly by the vegetation a more resilient basin in dry areas tended to have a lower amount of vegetation e which resulted in a more predictable wy fig 1 and eq 2 the close negative relationships between lai and ψ or φ fig 5 indicates that basins with larger lai and thus larger e were more vulnerable to climate warming and or drought at least for these dry areas this was different from basins in wet areas which were more responsive to precipitation owing to the relatively constant e demand and increased runoff always existed owing to the higher amount of precipitation 4 3 implications and limitations the vegetation greening in china has drawn growing attention in recent years tong et al 2018 chen et al 2019 the forest areas have been much enlarged in china due to the ecological projects such as grain for green and the three north belt program these afforestation projects have mitigated environmental problems via improving ecosystem services and also have significant hydrologic and biophysical feedbacks xiao 2014 peng et al 2014 for example a significant cooling effect and changes in water yield have been found based on modeling and in situ and or remote sensing observations e g peng et al 2014 liu et al 2016 however some studies also argued that the afforestation especially in the dry areas may also elevate e and thus intensify the local drought or water shortage cao 2008 wu et al 2014 liang et al 2018 our results partly support this by showing that basins with larger lai are less tolerant and thus may not easily adapt to climate changes such as frequent droughts in the near future the reason is likely due to water limitation and thus a greater sensitivity to even small changes in vegetation cover through significant changes in e these results suggest that caution should be taken when considering afforestation in this area because such increase in tree cover could increase the vulnerability of the basin to future climate change on the other hand besides lai other factors such as topography e g altitude slope could possibly influence the tolerance and plasticity of non resilient basins e g helman et al 2017 therefore influences of such factors should be also taken into account in future analyses indeed the relatively weak relationship between lai and ψ fig 5 especially when lai is large suggests that other unexplored factors may be involved in shaping the tolerance of a catchment in the tp as such further research should focus on basins covering various climate conditions topographic features and vegetation types to fully explore what regulates hydrologic resilience to climate change following creed et al 2014 and helman et al 2017 we neglected the interannual changes in the basin characteristics i e n in eq 1 uncertainties may arise from the assumption in both our research and two previous studies creed et al 2014 helman et al 2017 even though they used another form of the budyko equation parameter ω in the zhang model in fact besides human activities many other factors could lead to changes in n including changes in precipitation seasonality the snowfall proportion for cold catchments vegetation co2 concentration and glacial and snow cover melt e g woods 2003 donohue et al 2012 yang et al 2014 to deal with this we selected basins on the tibetan plateau with a minor human cuo et al 2013 the climate seasonality such as the precipitation seasonal changes and snowmelt among these years may also change the parameter n e g woods 2003 we only focused on the interannual scale and therefore climate change influences from the seasonality were not considered 5 conclusions climate change may have a significant impact on the runoff of basins in the tp the quantification of regional ecosystem responses to climate change such as warming and drying is essential for evaluating the climatic effects on water yield and can thus inform water resources management we proposed a simple and novel method based on the budyko framework to evaluate the hydrologic resilience of basins on the tp we found that most basins on the plateau had low hydrologic resilience indicating that these basins surrounding tp had a high vulnerability to climatic warming drying additionally we found that vegetation plays an essential role in determining the hydrological resilience of tp s basins particularly in non resilient basins the small resilience of such basins which decreases even more with the increase in lai suggets that afforestation efforts should be carefully considered in these areas our proposed method and findings may help predict the vegetation responses to future climate warming credit authorship contribution

257,estimation of co2 storage capacity in fractured porous reservoirs requires a better understanding of the co2 water flow fundamentals in fracture matrix systems there are few core flood experiments on three dimensional co2 water drainage in a fracture matrix system yet none have examined the impacts of the capillary continuity of fractures and fracture matrix interactions in this study twelve drainage experiments were conducted in four fracture matrix columns each comprising a vertical stack of a cylindrical rock core a filter paper serving as an analogue to a horizontal fracture and a ceramic plate the core sample was surrounded by open space at the top and circumferential sides to model fractures allowing for 3 d co2 water drainage in the rock core and displaced water draining across the horizontal fracture x ray computed tomography was conducted to visualize the dynamic invasion drainage processes in four rock core samples showing contrasts in anisotropy permeability and heterogeneity experimental results show 1 the equilibrium co2 saturations in the rock matrix vary from 0 10 to 0 60 at controlled capillary pressures up to 200 kpa 2 the co2 saturations in the matrix increaze with water saturation in the horizontal fracture resulting in better capillary continuity for water to drain across the fracture and 3 the fracture water saturation can be enhanced by the non uniform fracture capillary pressure and countercurrent flow of co2 and water across the fracture matrix interface in the case of high fracture water saturation matrix co2 saturation largely depends on matrix anisotropy and heterogeneity the core scale experimental results contribute to understand the fracture matrix interactions and co2 storage efficiency in fractured porous media keywords geological carbon storage fractured porous media two phase flow core flooding x ray ct fracture matrix interactions 1 introduction two phase flow characteristics of co2 water in subsurface fractured media are of great interest as fractured carbonate and sandstone reservoirs are increasingly considered as potential geological co2 sequestration gcs and simultaneous oil recovery locations because of their ubiquity in sedimentary basins agada et al 2016 in saline aquifers gcs in sandstone formations is also considerably influenced by the presence of fractures and faults as reported from the currently world s largest onshore co2 storage site the krechba site within the in salah gas field iding and ringrose 2010 it is also noted that fractures are a major source of uncertainty in subsurface media and the existence of unidentified fracture networks should be incorporated with well understood co2 water flow behaviors for risk analysis of storage projects narr et al 2006 march et al 2018 the bulk of co2 storage in fractured reservoirs occurs in the interconnected pore volumes of the rock matrix because of its high porosity peters and klavetter 1988 reported the fracture porosity three to five orders of magnitude lower than the matrix porosity although the preferential and fast flow of injected co2 is expected to occur in fractures due to the overall higher fracture permeability than that of the porous rock matrix co2 invasion into the rock matrix from fractures and brine drainage through matrix blocks are critical in establishing co2 storage in fractured reservoirs capillarity and gravity are usually major forces affecting the co2 invasion from fractures to the matrix whereas viscous force may be more relevant in the near well region where large pressure gradients may impose viscous displacement inside the matrix blocks march et al 2018 diffusion of dissolved co2 from fractures into the rock matrix could also be pronounced however it may take a longer time for co2 diffusion to contribute to storage capacity pruess et al 1990 zhou et al 2017 fig 1 presents the conceptual model of co2 water flow in a fractured system dominated by capillarity after co2 injection water desaturation in the largest flow pathways fractures occurs first followed by co2 invasion into matrix blocks e g the central block marked by the white dotted line the invasion of co2 from fractures to matrix can only occur when water drainage from one matrix block to its neighboring blocks occurs countercurrent flow of co2 and water across the same fracture could happen in any direction when 1 water is retained in portion of the fracture to an extent that water drainage across the fracture is available red arrow in fig 1 and 2 the capillary entry pressure of the water wet matrix or water wet portion of the matrix is lower than the capillary pressure in the fractures thick blue arrows in fig 1 for some of the fractured carbonates that may be either mixed wet or oil wet co2 could be the wetting phase and spontaneously imbibing the rock matrix al menhali et al 2016 arif et al 2017 gravity may facilitate water bridging in horizontal fractures and favor water drainage between blocks horie et al 1990 extensive core flood experiments have been conducted to investigate 1 the capillary pressure vs saturation characteristics of fractures under in situ conditions using x ray computed tomography ct scanning reitsma and kueper 1994 bertels et al 2001 huo and benson 2016 2 the fracture matrix transfer functions which are the backbone of dual porosity formulation in modeling of fluid flow in fractured porous media beckner et al 1987 gautam and mohanty 2004 lim and aziz 1995 rangel german and kovscek 2005 2006 rangel german et al 2006 penuela et al 2002 tao et al 2019 and 3 the potential capillary continuity between matrix blocks established by liquid bridges across open fractures with varying wettability surfaces aspenes et al 2008 dejam and hassanzadeh 2010 fernø et al 2011 common to all the studies above is that two phase flow was prohibited through the sample circumferential surface because confining pressure was applied to the core allowing displacement to occur only along the long axis from inlet to outlet to the best of our knowledge there are few core flood experiments on three dimensional co2 water drainage in a fracture matrix system and none have examined the impacts of the capillary continuity of fractures and fracture matrix interactions in this study we conducted water drainage experiments in four fracture matrix columns to investigate the 3 d co2 water drainage across a horizontal fracture between two neighboring matrix blocks each column was composed of a water wet rock core a filter paper that provides an analogue for horizontal fracture and a water wet ceramic plate that was located at the bottom of the vertical stack four rock core samples 5 cm diameter and 10 cm long with contrasts in foliation anisotropy permeability and heterogeneity were used as the upper matrix block two types of ceramic plates were selected as the lower matrix block to allow control of the capillary pressure applied to the upper matrix block without changing the hydraulic continuity downstream of the horizontal fracture the changes in fracture water saturation thus the capillary continuity and water relative permeability at applied capillary pressures pc the displacement efficiency and the drainage time scale in the upper matrix block were investigated through frequent x ray ct scans 2 material and methods 2 1 rock cores four rock core samples with a diameter of 5 0 cm and a length varying from 9 5 to 10 cm were used for the stacked column tests samples 1 and 2 were cut from a carbon tan sandstone block from outcropped late cretaceous formation utah us with bedding layers orthogonal and parallel to the long axis kocurek industries tx their average porosities were calculated from ct images and eq 1 as 0 16 and 0 15 respectively for each sample four thin disks 5 0 cm diameter and 1 0 cm thickness were oven dried and weighed followed by saturating with deionized di water under 101 kpa for over 6 h the water saturated disks were then weighed and the porosity of each disk was measured gravimetrically the measured porosities for samples 1 and 2 is 0 16 0 0012 and 0 15 0 0011 similar to the values obtained from ct images of 10 cm long cores the absolute air permeabilities of sample 1 and 2 were measured as 46 and 51 md more details on the permeability measurements of the samples can be seen in the supporting information fig s1 of si sample 3 was cut from a kentucky sandstone block virginia us with the long axis parallel to the bedding layers kocurek industries tx the porosity of sample 3 measured from ct images is 0 14 while the value from thin discs is 0 13 0 0012 the air permeability is measured as 6 67 md sample 4 a duperow dolostone was obtained from a depth of 1260 m from the wallewein 22 1 well a planned injection well for a co2 geological storage test at kevin dome montana the porosity of sample 4 was measured by water saturating under 101 kpa for 3 days until the time lapse ct images showed a constant porosity at 0 042 0 0012 the absolute air permeability for the sample was measured at 0 17 md table 1 lists the size porosity and permeability measurements on the four core samples fig 2a depicts the profile by blue curve of average porosity of 0 625 mm horizontal slices derived from x ray ct scans along the long axis with the background image showing the porosity distribution of a 2 d cross section along the central axis the porosity distribution of sample 4 by the x ray ct image indicates 1 a low porosity 0 02 to 0 04 portion p1 0 35 mm with two tight fractures 2 a low porosity 0 02 to 0 04 portion p2 35 to 55 mm with one open fracture and 3 a higher porosity 0 04 to 0 06 portion p3 55 to 95 mm with one tight fracture these fractures are marked by the white arrows in fig 2a and further discussed in section 3 3 the absolute water permeability of each sample in table 1 was converted from air permeability measurements considering klinkenberg effect klinkenberg 1941 jones and owens 1980 to quickly represent the sample characteristics we use high h medium m and low l permeability and bedding fracture orthogonal o to or parallel p to the water drainage path to redefine sample 1 ho 2 hp 3 mp and 4 lo we combine the sample name with the applied capillary pressure e g ho13 8 at an imposed capillary pressure of 13 8 kpa to denote an experiment water flow experiments were conducted in these samples with frequent x ray ct imaging to better understand the dynamic invasion drainage processes of co2 water and impacts of matrix properties with an aim to quantify the surface wettability of each sample we conducted contact angle measurements of a water droplet on the sample surface at ambient conditions the measured air water contact angles i e 21 2 6 22 2 0 22 0 7 and 46 0 9 for ho hp mp and lo respectively indicate that the four samples are water wet see more details in fig s2 of si the sandstone rocks ho and hp are composed mainly of quartz 90 and non swelling kaolinite 7 and we do not expect considerable changes of pore geometry after sample exposure to deionized di water sample mp is composed of quartz 61 feldspar 12 montmorillonite 15 and non swelling illite 12 although montmorillonite may potentially swell and reduce the matrix porosity and permeability its impacts on the co2 water flow in the fracture matrix system may not be pronounced due to the large contrast of capillary pressure saturation characteristics between fracture and matrix also note that we measured the sample porosities and characteristic curves pc s relations and conducted all of the water drainage experiments after fully saturating with di water thus the potential impacts from clay swelling have been compensated for sample lo is composed of calcite 70 dolomite 20 anhydrite 4 and clay 0 3 thus the impacts from exposure to di water were expected to be very small see more details on the sample mineralogy in tables s1 and s2 of si 2 2 experimental setup and procedures fig 2b presents a schematic of the experimental setup consisting of a reaction vessel and a pressure system that allows for co2 and water flow limited to a gauge pressure of 1035 kpa rocks were cored and end faces were sawn flat and sanded as smooth as necessary to fit into the acrylic core holder with an inner diameter of 5 08 cm and a length of 14 cm the core samples were maintained dry in an oven at 60 c prior to use the rock core was then pressed against a filter paper disk in contact with the capillary ceramic plate this arrangement was stabilized by a stiff spring at the top of the custom core holder two different types of ceramic plates soilmoisture equipment corp ca were used for samples ho and hp and samples mp and lo ceramics i and ii have a porosity of 0 45 and 0 34 a water absolute permeability of 6 0 and 0 17 md and a capillary entry pressure of 100 and 300 kpa respectively see table 1 the space between the vessel walls and the rock represents vertical fractures surrounding the matrix a single sheet of filter paper disk glass microfiber filter gf d whatman between the core bottom and the ceramic plate was used to simulate a horizontal fracture between the matrix blocks similar to stone et al 1992 the fracture thickness and porosity are 0 8 mm and 0 6 respectively while the fracture capillary pressure vs water saturation relations were measured and the dynamic co2 invasion into the top matrix block was monitored through frequent x ray ct scans see section 2 3 before each experiment the oven dried rock core filter paper and ceramic plate were first stacked and ct scanned in the reaction vessel the vessel was connected to vacuum at 101 kpa for over 2 h followed by di water injection through the bottom valve until the sample core was completely submerged in water the bottom valve was then closed and vacuum was maintained for 1 3 days depending on the samples used after saturating with water the ceramic plate established a threshold pressure for co2 invasion below which the plate will be fully saturated with water during the tests the pressure difference between co2 and water at atmospheric pressure was controlled and maintained higher than the capillary entry pressure of the rock core while lower than the value of the ceramic plate in this way the bottom ceramic plate was maintained fully water saturated verified by ct images at room pressure thus only downward drainage of water from the stacked column to the outlet through the bottom ceramic marked by the red arrow in fig 2b is expected during each experiment water between the rock core and vessel drained first allowing for co2 invasion at the top and from the circumferential surfaces of the rock core water desaturation in the horizontal fracture could also occur depending on the applied gauge pressures of co2 and capillary entry pressure of the fracture water was drained through the ceramic plate and the outflow tube into an outflow reservoir containing di water at the bottom the water outflow mass was monitored by weighing the outflow reservoir on a balance co2 was supplied to the vessel via a precise pressure regulator parker hannifin corp us at a resolution of 1 4 kpa from a 500d isco pump teledyne isco ne operated in a constant pressure mode the setup allows frequent x ray ct scans without disconnecting the reaction vessel from the pressure and drainage lines the vessel containing the core sample was oriented vertically to investigate potential gravity effects and positioned horizontally for very brief when compared to the time needed for drainage durations when an x ray ct scan was conducted a ge lightspeed 16 ct scanner was used to visualize the 3 d co2 distribution and image data were used to calculate co2 saturation at a voxel size of 0 1925 0 1925 0 625 mm3 scans in each experiment were performed at 120 kv and 160 ma each ct scan took 24 s which is short in relative to the time scale of fluid migration in the rock samples the sample porosity φ and co2 saturation s c o 2 in the rock core and the horizontal fracture during each test were obtained from background and experimental scans as given in the followings 1 ϕ c t w a t e r s a t c t d r y c t w a t e r c t a i r 2 s c o 2 c t w a t e r s a t c t exp c t w a t e r s a t c t d r y where ct is the ct number in hounsfield units computed for each voxel and that includes contributions from each pure component material present in the system i e air di water co2 and rock the ct watersat and ct dry refer to the ct values for each voxel of water saturated and oven dried core while ct exp is the ct value obtained at different times during each co2 displacement experiment the ct numbers of the two pure reference fluids water ct water 0 and air ct air 998 are known from previous calibration note that the two equations are derived originally from the linear attenuation coefficients μ the truly measurable quantity by x ray absorption and uses ct μ μwater μwater akin and kovscek 2003 they also imply that the ct number of a voxel can be expressed as the linear combination of the ct numbers associated with the volume fractions of each of its components this assumption is justified by the linear attenuation coefficient thus the ct number is proportional to the bulk density of materials for x ray energies above 100 kev wellington and vinegar 1987 peters and hardham 1990 pini and madonna 2016 in eq 2 the ct numbers of air saturated and co2 saturated core are assumed be equal since the similar density of co2 and air at the low imposed pressures in this study applying eqs 1 and 2 to each voxel x ray ct images have been widely used during core flood experiments to better understand the co2 water flow and displacement characteristics at the core and sub core scales perrin and benson 2009 shi et al 2011 krevor et al 2012 berg et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 xu et al 2020 in this study slice averaged properties were calculated using ct numbers averaged over a circular cross section slice the core porosity determined from x ray ct scans was comparable to that calculated gravimetrically from core mass changes at dried and saturated conditions 2 3 gas intrusion capillary pressures of matrix cores and fracture we cut thin disks 5 0 cm diameter and 1 0 cm thickness from core samples of each rock described above and measured their gas intrusion capillary pressures using the pressure plate method dane and hopmans 2002 tokunaga et al 2017 a 1500 kpa chamber soilmoisture equipment corp us was used and compressed nitrogen was supplied to the chamber via a two stage pressure regulator the outflow tube from the pressure plate led into the bottom of an outflow reservoir containing di water and the free surface of this reservoir was kept at the same level as the plate this method is well suited for directly controlling pc via changing pressure differences above a porous ceramic plate we assume no considerable impact of gases co2 or n2 on pc s measurements because of the similar interfacial tensions for co2 water 71 03 mn m at 100 kpa 25 c and n2 water 71 72 mn m at 12 mpa 25 30 c at the experimental pressure and temperature conditions massoudi and king 1974 chun and wilkinson 1995 the sample disks were initially saturated with di water and the applied pc and corresponding water saturations in the disks were monitored using a precise pressure gauge and by frequently weighing the disks the equilibrium water saturation in a sample for a particular pc was then determined at constant mass fig 3a b display the pc sw functions for samples ho hp and mp with error bars obtained from multiple sample disks for sample lo two thin disks were obtained from the rock plug at locations next to p1 and p3 while sampling from p2 was difficult due to the open fracture fig 3c shows the very different pc sw functions for p1 and p3 induced by potential micro fractures within the centimeter scale core sample mirzaei and das 2007 performed a comprehensive modeling sensitivity analysis on the micro heterogeneity effects on pc sw functions and conduced a non linear correlation between them depending highly on the distribution of micro heterogeneity for larger scale fracture matrix systems the co2 water flow and co2 storage efficiency would be collectively affected capillary and gravity forces ide et al 2007 in these systems impacts from fracture orientation connectivity and transmissibility relative to the matrix will be more pronounced the pc sw function of the horizontal fracture in the stacked columns was quantified through water drainage tests the fracture water saturations sw f under different applied pc were determined through x ray ct images fig 3d displays the pc sw f relation with error bars obtained from two repeated tests at 13 8 68 9 and 200 kpa the capillary pressure characteristics of both matrix cores and the horizontal fracture can be described by the van genuchten 1980 model as follows 3 p c 1 α s w s w r 1 s w r 1 m 1 1 m where s w r refers to the residual water saturation and α and m are fitting parameters table s3 of the si lists the fitting parameters of the van genuchten 1980 model with r 2 values higher than 0 99 the capillary entry pressure refers to the minimum pc required for co2 intrusion into the water saturated core sample or fracture which corresponds to the inflection point identified by the red arrows in the pc sw relations in fig 3 the values for samples ho hp and mp are measured as 13 8 13 8 135 kpa the pore size interpreted from the capillary entry pressures ranges from 1 10 μm which are consistent with the sandstone classifications from nelson 2009 for sample lo the capillary entry pressures are 135 and 66 kpa for p1 and p3 respectively while the value for the horizontal fracture is 41 4 kpa in the stacked column tests at pc 68 9 kpa we expect considerable fracture desaturation and concomitant reduction of capillary continuity between the top and bottom matrix blocks see section 3 3 the non zero non constant and porous medium like capillary pressure of the horizontal fracture in this study is representative of certain types of natural fractures due to 1 the large variations of fracture apertures 2 the complex geometry of a fracture network and 3 the wide presence of mineralization in fractures ramsay 1980 reported the observations of tectonically deformed crustal rocks and cracks and fissures filled with silicate or carbonate mineral the open microfractures filled with crystalline material derived from pressure solution in the rock matrix and chemical transfer of this material into the low pressure fluid filled space a mechanism termed crack seal morrow et al 1990 further reported the permeability measurements of the mineral filled fractures in the mesaverde formation rock samples which were of the same order as the surrounding matrix and presented water saturation dependent behavior similar to the porous matrix parry 1998 presented the fault fluid compositions and solubilities of the fracture sealing minerals while fletcher and merino 2001 summarized the published insights into the mineralization and crystal growth in rock fractures and proposed models on the coupling between mineral growth kinetics and mechanical response of the rock in summary the wide presence of mineralization in natural fractures and the resulting changes in fracture properties e g permeability capillary pressure and chemistry impose fracture pc sw functions similar to porous media resulting in a large range of contrast with matrix the co2 water flow fundamentals in these fractured porous media are of importance to gcs and other subsurface processes also note the capillary entry pressure of the fracture in the stacked columns is higher than that of the matrix in samples ho and hp this may reduce the effect of the water flow barrier of the fracture and help highlight the importance of capillary continuity the experiments still allow us to focus on co2 water displacements in these fracture matrix systems 2 4 water drainage experiments twelve water drainage experiments were conducted to investigate the co2 water displacements with controlled pc up to 200 kpa see table 2 five tests in the column stacked with samples ho ho13 8 ho30 7 ho27 6 ho41 4 and ho68 9 were conducted to investigate the fundamentals of co2 water flow and co2 saturation in matrix with high fracture water saturation thus high capillary continuity tests under varying imposed capillary pressures from 13 8 to 68 9 kpa were used to understand the impacts of capillary pressures two different comparison and sensitivity analyzes were conduced the first analysis focused on the effects of bedding orientation by two experiments with sample hp hp13 8 and hp41 4 maintaining similarly high capillary continuities in fracture for the second sensitivity analysis experiments were conduced targeting at water drainage across the single desaturated fracture thus reduced capillary continuity in sample mp mp150 mp200a mp200b as well as water drainage across multiple desaturated fractures in sample lo lo150 lo200 during the experiment the impacts of co2 dissolution and mass transfer is expected to be minimal because of 1 the low co2 solubility in water 0 068 mol l from zhao et al 2015 under the low pressure 200 kpa and temperature 25 c conditions in this study and 2 the very small impacts of co2 dissolution and mass transfer on two phase displacement and distribution under drainage conditions for instance in a previous study chang et al 2017 we investigated supercritical co2 scco2 water displacement and dissolution in an mm scale micromodel at 9 mpa and 40 c and monitored the co2 dissolution and mass transfer into residual water results showed overall constant co2 saturation after drainage and stable two phase distribution in the micromodel due to the continuous inflow of co2 although co2 dissolution occurred at the two phase interface is considerably higher 1 225 mol l at the elevated pressure and temperature 3 results 3 1 co2 water flow in the matrix with high fracture water saturation five drainage experiments were conducted in sample ho at varying pc from 13 8 to 68 9 kpa during each experiment dynamic co2 invasion and water drainage were monitored by frequent x ray ct scans and the images were used to calculate both slice and core average co2 water saturations at a number of times until a capillary quasi equilibrium was reached according to the pc sw f characteristics of the fracture in fig 3d fracture water desaturation to 0 68 0 96 is expected depending on the imposed pc values 3 1 1 dynamic water drainage and co2 saturation fig 4a shows selected time lapse images of 3 d co2 distribution purple color in test ho13 8 the numbers in the parentheses are experimental time and core average co2 saturations respectively also displayed in the figure the last sub image is the 3 d porosity distribution for comparison the temporal co2 distributions indicate preferential co2 uptake along multiple high porosity layers in contact with the circumferential surface the variations of the slice averaged co2 saturation along the core sample from top to bottom shown in fig 4b are overall consistent with those of porosity not in a perfect correlation however indicating porosity and pore size are not necessarily correlated the inconsistencies in correlation and offset of the peak co2 saturation vs porosity at some portions of the sample e g marked by the red dotted lines at 50 70 and 78 mm from the sample top in fig 4b could be attributed to the competition between different co2 fingers from the circumferential surface as shown in fig 4a co2 fingers developed preferentially along the high porosity layer at 38 mm which induced drainage of resident water towards the core bottom and resulted in the other co2 fingers to develop slightly beneath the peak porosity positions at 50 70 and 78 mm at the bottom portion of the core e g at 90 mm and close to the outlet the variations of co2 saturation are more consistent with those of porosity as water drainage pathway was shortest and easiest towards the outlet the core average co2 saturation increased with time for 78 h and remained relatively constant at 0 15 0 006 after exposure to co2 until 288 h when the experiment was stopped 3 1 2 effects of capillary pressure the pc effects on co2 water displacement in sample ho were investigated by specifying co2 pressures of 20 7 27 6 41 4 and 68 9 kpa while keeping water drainage pressure at atmospheric x ray ct images were obtained during each experiment until the co2 distribution and saturation in the core were stable with time fig 5 shows the co2 distributions at early time fig 5a 1 h and quasi equilibrium state fig 5b under the five capillary pressures when pc was increased above the capillary entry pressure of the core 13 8 kpa most co2 invaded into the rock along its circumferential surface preferentially through the higher porosity layers again not perfectly correlated this dominant circumferential inflow of co2 from the surrounding fractures can be attributed to the larger circumferential area compared to that of the top surface and reduced water drainage pathway towards the bottom fracture than axial flow from top for instance we observed high co2 saturations in the bottom portion of the core at 1 h where the water drainage pathway was shortest towards the outlet fig 5c d depict the core average co2 saturations vs time and variations of slice average values along the core at the quasi equilibrium state for each case we may infer that the core scale co2 saturations increase with increasing pc with more co2 uptake in the low porosity layers smoothing the co2 saturation variations along the core sample we also define a specific co2 saturation the ratio between temporal co2 saturation vs co2 saturation at capillary equilibrium and present the temporal changes of the value in the inserted sub image in fig 5c as the imposed capillary pressures are higher than the capillary entry pressure pc 13 8 kpa the temporal increases in the specific co2 saturation follow the similar trend and time scale to converge at the capillary equilibrium saturation as the dominant co2 invasion from the circumferential surface and water drainage in the normal direction this is different from 1 d two phase flow where confining pressure is applied and co2 water flow is prohibited across the circumferential surface the quasi equilibrium pc vs water saturation generally follows the pc sw curve obtained from disk measurements in fig 3a 3 2 effects of bedding orientations two flow experiments hp13 8 and hp41 4 were conducted in sample hp to better understand the impacts of matrix bedding orientations on co2 water displacement sample hp was cut parallel to the bedding with porosity variations from 0 15 to 0 16 along the long axis during these experiments high water saturations 0 60 were maintained in the horizontal fracture table 2 resulting in high capillary continuity for water drainage across the fracture fig 6a b present the dynamic co2 saturations and distributions in sample hp during the two experiments in both cases co2 preferentially invaded the core sample from one side high porosity and displaced resident water toward the opposite side low porosity where the displaced water migrated downward under single phase water flow condition during most of the experiment duration the core average co2 saturation was stable at 0 11 after 120 h in hp13 8 and 0 50 after 43 h in hp41 4 see fig 6c these quasi equilibrium co2 saturations are close to those 0 15 and 0 56 obtained in sample ho at the same pc values as should be expected the parallel bedding in sample hp however facilitated downward drainage of water and greatly shortened the time scale to reach equilibrium compared to that in sample ho at the same pc 41 4 kpa see table 2 3 3 water drainage across single desaturated fracture and fracture matrix interactions co2 water displacements after fracture desaturation were investigated in the column stacked with sample mp with a higher capillary entry pressure 135 kpa relative to the horizontal fracture 69 kpa for the two experiments mp150 and mp200a we expected 1 larger water desaturation in the fracture than that in the matrix see fig 3b and d and 2 considerable reduction in the capillary continuity of the fracture with increased water drainage resistance due to the blockage of water flow thus decreaze of water relative permeability across the bottom fracture by invaded co2 fig 7a b show the selected images of co2 distribution and co2 saturation along the core at different times for mp150 it can be seen that co2 initially invades the higher porosity portion of the core at the bottom close to the horizontal fracture and propagates upwards in the matrix this process may retard co2 invasion from the circumferential surface the core average co2 saturation increases with time and stabilizes at 0 24 after 264 h fig 7c the pair of specified pc and measured core scale co2 saturation follows the pc s curve measured from 1 cm thin disks in fig 2b the slice average co2 saturation shown in fig 7b however varies greatly from the top 0 18 to the bottom 0 30 indicating the impact of sub core scale heterogeneity in the 10 cm long core by the end of the experiment water saturation in the bottom fracture is 0 50 considerably higher than the value of 0 26 measured for the fracture pc sw f function in fig 3d also note the pronounced difference in equilibrium matrix co2 saturation between samples ho and hp vs sample mp at similar porosities and when maintaining sufficient fracture water saturation 0 5 the maximum storage capacity in samples ho and hp 0 60 at 68 9 kpa could be as much as 2 5 times higher than that in sample mp 0 24 at 150 kpa the unexpectedly high fracture water saturation in mp150 can be attributed to the countercurrent flow of co2 and water across the fracture matrix interface i e co2 invades the matrix core from the bottom fracture and water drains from the matrix core across the same interface to better understand the process we compared the co2 distribution in the bottom portion of the core next to the horizontal fracture fig 8a b with the water distribution within the fracture fig 8c d at early time 1 h and the end of the experiment 264 h once exposed to co2 the bottom fracture is invaded by co2 and resident water is partially displaced as indicated by the two black patches representing low fracture water saturations in fig 8c pc in these patches may exceed the capillary entry pressure of the matrix core above thus co2 invasion into the rock matrix is available at the same time drainage of water occurs downward next to the co2 flow pathway resulting in a high water saturation patch in the bottom fracture in fig 8c see the bright band in the middle note the consistent geometry of the high sw f patch vs co2 plume in the bottom portion of the core this high sw f patch hydraulically bridges the top core and bottom ceramic plate providing an efficient water drainage pathway across the fracture and allowing for continuous co2 invasion into the top core by the end of the experiment 264 h the wide invasion of co2 in the matrix fig 8b drained water more uniformly towards the fracture resulting in more distributed sw f in fig 8d to better understand the countercurrent flow of co2 and water at the fracture matrix interface we flipped the matrix core vertically and applied a higher pc 200 kpa in case mp200a in which the lower porosity portion was pressed against the fracture during the experiment sw f remained stable at 0 19 following the pc sw f relation in fig 3d but lower than the value 0 50 obtained in case mp150 this reduced sw f resulted in considerably different co2 distribution in the top core as shown in fig 9a co2 invasion initiated at the top high porosity portion however could not continuously propagate within the matrix instead the majority of co2 invaded from the circumferential surface at a reduced rate after 138 h of co2 in this case the core average co2 saturation increased slowly with time and we stopped the test at 1222 h before reaching the capillary equilibrium by the end of the experiment the core average co2 saturation is 0 16 lower than the value in mp150 0 24 although a higher pc was applied and maintained for a significant longer time see fig 9c we then conducted an additional drainage test mp200b in which the same pc 200 kpa was applied while the junctions between the surrounding and horizontal fractures were partially sealed by epoxy coating around the circumferential surface of the horizontal fracture the seal was not perfect as a crack developed within the thin epoxy layer when pressed the core against the ceramic plate but was able to reduce co2 invasion and increase fracture water saturation to 0 30 fig 9b c show the faster co2 invasion and higher co2 saturation in the core when compared to case mp200a under the same pc the three drainage experiments indicate that efficient co2 uptake in the matrix and water drainage across fracture are only possible when sufficient water saturation thus capillary continuity and water relative permeability is maintained in the horizontal fracture the capillary continuity of the fracture can be greatly enhanced by fracture matrix interactions through a countercurrent flow between co2 and water when 1 the pc and co2 water distribution are non uniform in the fracture and 2 the local pc exceeds the capillary entry pressure of matrix at the interface 3 4 co2 water drainage across multiple desaturated fractures we investigated the co2 uptake in the matrix and water drainage across a single fracture from a number of cases samples ho hp and mp in this section we present co2 water drainage across multiple horizontal fractures from two experiments lo150 and lo200 in the naturally fractured duperow dolostone sample lo sample lo is characterized by three alternating fracture matrix portions with capillary pressure contrasts shown in fig 3c fig 10a b show the temporal changes in core density relative to the initially water saturated condition after co2 exposure at pc 150 and 200 kpa calculating co2 saturations for each pixel using eq 2 resulted in considerable noise due to the low porosity nature of the core some pixels or portions of the sample were too tight to have distinguishable ct signal changes between ctwatersat and ctdry ctwatersat and ctexp noise was further amplified as ctwatersat ctdry 0 or negative was in the denominator of eq 2 to reduce the noise we converted ctwatersat and ctexp to density ρ watersat and ρ exp through a pre established correlation function and calculated density changes δρ ρ exp ρ watersat to represent the co2 invasion and water drainage in both figures brighter color refers to larger density reduction thus higher co2 saturation as shown in fig 10a b density reduction started in the four fractures at early time 8 5 h at pc 150 kpa and 6 h at 200 kpa followed by matrix density reduction until the end of experiments at 701 and 841 h a larger matrix density reduction was also observed in the bottom portion of the core at later times e g 262 5 h in fig 10a and 264 h in fig 10b in sample lo the low matrix porosity and permeability and high capillary entry pressure hindered fracture matrix interaction at the interface the fracture water saturations during the two experiments were measured at 0 26 and 0 21 following the fracture pc sw f relation shown in fig 3d we also calculated the slice average co2 saturation using eq 2 by averaging the ctexp ctwatersat ctdry values over 50 000 voxels in each slice and showed in fig 10c the variations along the core at the end of the two experiments from the figure we observed 1 higher co2 saturations in the four fractures validating the initial assumption of drainage occurring first in the fractures see the peaks marked by the black arrows 2 the overall co2 saturation in p3 was higher than that in p1 and p2 and 3 co2 saturation in p3 increases with increasing pc while it remained constant in p1 and p2 independent of the pc applied at pc 200 kpa the average co2 saturation in p3 was stable at 0 44 after 841 h exposure to co2 similar to the value of 0 45 obtained from thin disk pc sw measurements marked by the blue dashed line in fig 10c this indicated capillary equilibrium state in p3 the average co2 saturation in p1 however remained low 0 10 by the end of the two experiments note the gas saturation measured from thin disks at the capillary equilibrium state is higher at 0 25 marked by the blue dashed lines for p1 in fig 10c for water drainage from p1 the multiple desaturated fractures including the two in p2 p3 and the one beneath the matrix increased water flow resistance along the pathway thus considerably reduced the drainage efficiency at the experimental time scale at this point the fractures served as barriers for further co2 invasion into matrix similar to the modeling results from bogdanov et al 2003 who concluded that fractures can act as obstacles to the flow in their normal directions due to capillary effects by the end of the experiments the core average co2 saturations were measured as 0 29 and 0 19 at pc 150 and 200 kpa see fig 10d 4 discussion in sections 3 1 and 3 2 we investigated the co2 water flow in fracture matrix systems with high capillary continuity in the fracture in sections 3 3 and 3 4 two different comparison and sensitivity analyzes were conducted with reduced capillary continuities in the fracture and core samples having different properties these experiments were motivated by the long consideration of the assumption of the on off fashion and constant capillary entry pressure of natural fractures the single block concept has been widely adopted for modeling multiphase flow in fractured reservoirs through the well known dual porosity model warren and root 1963 in the model the drainage of matrix blocks by invading fluid occurs independently so that the performance of a stack of blocks is equal to the performance of a single block multiplied by the number of individual blocks theoretical analysis and examination of the field performance of some fractured reservoirs however indicate the existence of some capillary continuity between matrix blocks as 1 the existence of formation rocks that are not completely separated or isolated from other blocks by open natural fractures festoy and van golf racht 1989 liu and rutqvist 2010 and 2 bridging of matrix blocks by residual water in fractures that creates potential hydraulic connections for water drainage across the fractures sulak 1990 hermansen et al 1997 agarwal et al 1999 rangel german and kovscek 2006 rangel german et al 2006 firoozabadi 2000 de la porte et al 2005 fernø et al 2011 through a series of stacked block experiments horie et al 1990 and stones et al 1992 reported that the fracture capillary pressure is water saturation dependent and might have a functional form similar to that of a matrix reitsma and kueper 1994 measured the capillary pressure vs saturation in a single rough walled fracture which was well represented by a brooks corey porous media capillary pressure function with a distinct entry pressure observed the errors introduced when ignoring nonlinear kr curves and non zero pc in fractures were demonstrated by de la porte et al 2005 who presented that displacement efficiency could be underestimated by a factor of two when fracture capillary pressure was set to zero a detailed investigation is required which is one of the objectives in this study to better understand the impacts of the non constant porous like capillary pressure of fractures on co2 water drainage and co2 saturations in fracture matrix systems fig 11 summarizes the relationships of average matrix co2 saturation vs applied capillary pressure in stacked fracture matrix systems the bars bound the standard deviations of co2 saturation along the matrix cores calculated from each ct image slice 0 625 mm thickness the numbers in parenthesis in the figure represent the corresponding water saturations in the bottom fracture at steady state overall there exists a range of critical capillary pressure values below and above which the matrix co2 saturation vs capillary pressure relations are considerably different here when pc is low 100 kpa and fracture water saturations are high 0 6 the matrix co2 saturations in samples ho and hp increase with increasing pc depending on the matrix pc sw characteristics note the matrix co2 saturations vary by a larger span in sample ho indicated by the bars where the bedding layers are normal to the water drainage direction also recall the faster water drainage to the capillary quasi equilibrium state 43 h in sample hp at pc 41 4 kpa where bedding is parallel to the water drainage pathway compared to 145 h required for sample ho table 2 in sample hp co2 and water maintain high saturation along their individual pathways see fig 6 and thus high relative permeabilities for both fluids with frequent ct imaging we directly visualized the 3 d co2 water drainage in the stacked columns and indicated the impacts of matrix bedding orientations relative to the fracture that maintains high capillary continuity e g 0 50 to 0 96 when pc is higher and fracture water desaturation occurs e g 100 kpa in this study the reduced capillary continuity of the fracture hinders water drainage from and co2 invasion into the top matrix core thus matrix co2 saturation in sample mp decreases from 0 24 at a fracture water saturation of 0 50 in mp150 to 0 16 at a fracture water saturation of 0 19 in mp200a even when a higher pc was applied to the latter see fig 11 in mp150 the spatial and temporal changes in fracture water saturation vs matrix co2 saturation indicate the countercurrent flow of co2 and water at the fracture matrix interface compared to mp200b the fracture water saturation thus the capillary continuity of the fracture and matrix co2 saturation were enhanced by 1 the non uniform co2 water distribution in the fracture and 2 the lower capillary entry pressure of matrix relative to portions of the fracture see section 3 3 the highest matrix co2 saturation presented in mp200b when fracture water saturation and capillary pressure increased simultaneously by reducing the circumferential surface of fracture available to co2 invasion results from mp150 mp200a and mp200b indicate the complex co2 water flow across the fracture matrix interface and the importance of fracture and matrix properties e g the capillary entry pressures in determining co2 water flow in fractured porous media in previous modeling work we investigated the impacts of capillary continuity connectivity on co2 storage capacity and efficiency in meter scale stacked columns bandilla et al 2019 numerical simulations were conducted on stacked homogeneous matrix blocks with varying matrix matrix connectivities at 0 30 and 100 modeling results showed no considerable difference of co2 saturation distribution in the stacked columns for the cases of 30 and 100 matrix matrix connectivities while significant difference in co2 saturation distribution was observed between the 0 case and the 30 to 100 cases similar to the modeling results we showed that when capillary continuity determined by fracture water saturation is equal and over 0 3 case mp150 and mp200a co2 saturations in the top matrix are not considerably affected by the fracture whereas when the fracture water saturation is less than 0 3 case mp200b the matrix co2 saturation is greatly hindered over a longer period of time meanwhile our lab observations indicated a more complicated counter current flow at the fracture matrix interface as well as the pronounced impacts of matrix heterogeneity and anisotropy all these need to be considered for a more accurate predication of co2 storage efficiency in addition ţene et al 2017 investigated the two phase flow in fractured porous media using a projection based embedded discrete fracture model pedfm considering the fracture matrix coupling terms by a cross media transmissibility modeling results indicate the impacts of fracture positions and the cross media conductivity contrasts kim et al 2011 examined the experimental pc sw functions of heterogeneous carbonate rock samples and concluded that leverett j function cannot accurately describe the carbonate rocks due to heterogeneous pore systems with fractures and vugs the x ray ct images from this study directly visualized the dependence of co2 water flow and pc sw functions on fractures and matrix and indicated that single leverett j function may not be applicable in scaling pc sw functions for field scale studies considering the orders of magnitude difference between fracture and matrix permeability at last differing from the columns stacked with a single fracture samples ho hp and mp tests in sample lo with multiple horizontal fractures present 1 the largest variations of co2 saturation within the core fig 11 and 2 the four fractures orthogonal to the water drainage direction served as conduits for co2 invasion at early time they however hindered water drainage across and further co2 invasion from these fractures into neighboring matrix fig 10 these can be attributed to the increased water flow resistance thus decreased water relative permeability across the desaturated fractures while the co2 water flow within a fracture or fracture network has been investigated by laboratory experiments and modeling shukla et al 2010 perera et al 2011 oh et al 2013 celia et al 2015 march et al 2018 tao et al 2019 cross fracture flow is worthy of a systematic and detailed investigation results from sample lo imply the spatial and temporal dependent role of fractures for 3 d co2 water flow the importance of fracture network e g distribution orientation connectivities and transmissibility characteristics with respect to the matrix in determining co2 distribution and storage efficiency common to all cases above is the observed higher co2 saturation at the bottom portion of the matrix cores 1 in samples ho and hp with high fracture continuity regardless of matrix anisotropy and applied pc e g figs 5 and 6 and 2 in samples mp and lo where fractures were desaturated and capillary continuity was considerably reduced figs 7 and 10 this cannot be predicted by the dual porosity approach that assumes zero capillary continuity through the fracture warren and root 1963 or observed by the classic core flood experiments where confining pressure is applied and co2 water flow is prohibited across the circumferential surface perrin and benson 2009 krevor et al 2012 chang et al 2013 2014 pini and benson 2013 in our experiments the 3 d displacement enables co2 invasion through the bottom fracture into matrix and countercurrent water drainage from the matrix this may benefit the fracture matrix flow and mass transfer and co2 storage efficiency in fractured reservoirs 5 conclusions and implications recent modeling results have demonstrated significant co2 storage efficiency in fractured reservoirs when preferentially drained fractures retain certain hydraulic capillary continuity in this study we investigated the co2 water flow across an mm scale fracture and storage efficiency in rock matrix at room temperature and controlled capillary pressures up to 200 kpa frequent x ray ct scans provided direct observations on the processes and show the importance of fracture capillary continuity and fracture matrix interactions we observed the increase of displacement efficiency in the matrix with increasing fracture water saturation capillary continuity and presented that the fracture water saturations could be enhanced by the non uniform fracture capillary pressure and countercurrent flow of co2 and water across the fracture matrix interface the displacement efficiency was also affected by matrix heterogeneity and anisotropy when high fracture water saturations 0 6 were maintained in naturally fractured reservoirs the interfacial tension of co2 water is expected to be considerably lower than that under the experimental conditions in this study in addition fractures develop with a wider range of apertures from microns to much larger while individual fractures may also contain spatially variable apertures microns to millimeters these might collectively result in spatially variable and a larger span of capillary pressure contrasts between fractures vs matrix while cautions are needed before applying the experimental results to the field this study implies that tight fractures and tight portions of a rough fracture may sustain high water saturation allowing for water drainage across multiple matrix blocks and co2 invasion from large fractures the cross fracture flow of water may bridge the preferentially drained fractures ahead of the co2 plume and enhance co2 storage efficiency in matrix in summary adequate capillary continuity of fractures and fracture matrix interactions may result in continuous displacement that occurs over multiple matrix blocks to an extent that the single block based dual porosity model may greatly underestimate the co2 storage efficiency in fractured reservoirs credit authorship contribution statement chun

257,estimation of co2 storage capacity in fractured porous reservoirs requires a better understanding of the co2 water flow fundamentals in fracture matrix systems there are few core flood experiments on three dimensional co2 water drainage in a fracture matrix system yet none have examined the impacts of the capillary continuity of fractures and fracture matrix interactions in this study twelve drainage experiments were conducted in four fracture matrix columns each comprising a vertical stack of a cylindrical rock core a filter paper serving as an analogue to a horizontal fracture and a ceramic plate the core sample was surrounded by open space at the top and circumferential sides to model fractures allowing for 3 d co2 water drainage in the rock core and displaced water draining across the horizontal fracture x ray computed tomography was conducted to visualize the dynamic invasion drainage processes in four rock core samples showing contrasts in anisotropy permeability and heterogeneity experimental results show 1 the equilibrium co2 saturations in the rock matrix vary from 0 10 to 0 60 at controlled capillary pressures up to 200 kpa 2 the co2 saturations in the matrix increaze with water saturation in the horizontal fracture resulting in better capillary continuity for water to drain across the fracture and 3 the fracture water saturation can be enhanced by the non uniform fracture capillary pressure and countercurrent flow of co2 and water across the fracture matrix interface in the case of high fracture water saturation matrix co2 saturation largely depends on matrix anisotropy and heterogeneity the core scale experimental results contribute to understand the fracture matrix interactions and co2 storage efficiency in fractured porous media keywords geological carbon storage fractured porous media two phase flow core flooding x ray ct fracture matrix interactions 1 introduction two phase flow characteristics of co2 water in subsurface fractured media are of great interest as fractured carbonate and sandstone reservoirs are increasingly considered as potential geological co2 sequestration gcs and simultaneous oil recovery locations because of their ubiquity in sedimentary basins agada et al 2016 in saline aquifers gcs in sandstone formations is also considerably influenced by the presence of fractures and faults as reported from the currently world s largest onshore co2 storage site the krechba site within the in salah gas field iding and ringrose 2010 it is also noted that fractures are a major source of uncertainty in subsurface media and the existence of unidentified fracture networks should be incorporated with well understood co2 water flow behaviors for risk analysis of storage projects narr et al 2006 march et al 2018 the bulk of co2 storage in fractured reservoirs occurs in the interconnected pore volumes of the rock matrix because of its high porosity peters and klavetter 1988 reported the fracture porosity three to five orders of magnitude lower than the matrix porosity although the preferential and fast flow of injected co2 is expected to occur in fractures due to the overall higher fracture permeability than that of the porous rock matrix co2 invasion into the rock matrix from fractures and brine drainage through matrix blocks are critical in establishing co2 storage in fractured reservoirs capillarity and gravity are usually major forces affecting the co2 invasion from fractures to the matrix whereas viscous force may be more relevant in the near well region where large pressure gradients may impose viscous displacement inside the matrix blocks march et al 2018 diffusion of dissolved co2 from fractures into the rock matrix could also be pronounced however it may take a longer time for co2 diffusion to contribute to storage capacity pruess et al 1990 zhou et al 2017 fig 1 presents the conceptual model of co2 water flow in a fractured system dominated by capillarity after co2 injection water desaturation in the largest flow pathways fractures occurs first followed by co2 invasion into matrix blocks e g the central block marked by the white dotted line the invasion of co2 from fractures to matrix can only occur when water drainage from one matrix block to its neighboring blocks occurs countercurrent flow of co2 and water across the same fracture could happen in any direction when 1 water is retained in portion of the fracture to an extent that water drainage across the fracture is available red arrow in fig 1 and 2 the capillary entry pressure of the water wet matrix or water wet portion of the matrix is lower than the capillary pressure in the fractures thick blue arrows in fig 1 for some of the fractured carbonates that may be either mixed wet or oil wet co2 could be the wetting phase and spontaneously imbibing the rock matrix al menhali et al 2016 arif et al 2017 gravity may facilitate water bridging in horizontal fractures and favor water drainage between blocks horie et al 1990 extensive core flood experiments have been conducted to investigate 1 the capillary pressure vs saturation characteristics of fractures under in situ

2002 tao et al 2019 and 3 the potential capillary continuity between matrix blocks established by liquid bridges across open fractures with varying wettability surfaces aspenes et al 2008 dejam and hassanzadeh 2010 fernø et al 2011 common to all the studies above is that two phase flow was prohibited through the sample circumferential surface because confining pressure was applied to the core allowing displacement to occur only along the long axis from inlet to outlet to the best of our knowledge there are few core flood experiments on three dimensional co2 water drainage in a fracture matrix system and none have examined the impacts of the capillary continuity of fractures and fracture matrix interactions in this study we conducted water drainage experiments in four fracture matrix columns to investigate the 3 d co2 water drainage across a horizontal fracture between two neighboring matrix blocks each column was composed of a water wet rock core a filter paper that provides an analogue for horizontal fracture and a water wet ceramic plate that was located at the bottom of the vertical stack four rock core samples 5 cm diameter and 10 cm long with contrasts in foliation anisotropy permeability and heterogeneity were used as the upper matrix block two types of ceramic plates were selected as the lower matrix block to allow control of the capillary pressure applied to the upper matrix block without changing the hydraulic continuity downstream of the horizontal fracture the changes in fracture water saturation thus the capillary continuity and water relative permeability at applied capillary pressures pc the displacement efficiency and the drainage time scale in the upper matrix block were investigated through frequent x ray ct scans 2 material and methods 2 1 rock cores four rock core samples with a diameter of 5 0 cm and a length varying from 9 5 to 10 cm were used for the stacked column tests samples 1 and 2 were cut from a carbon tan sandstone block from outcropped late cretaceous formation utah us with bedding layers orthogonal and parallel to the long axis kocurek industries tx their average porosities were calculated from ct images and eq 1 as 0 16 and 0 15 respectively for each sample four thin disks 5 0 cm diameter and 1 0 cm thickness were oven dried and weighed followed by saturating with deionized di water under 101 kpa for over 6 h the water saturated disks were then weighed and the porosity of each disk was measured gravimetrically the measured porosities for samples 1 and 2 is 0 16 0 0012 and 0 15 0 0011 similar to the values obtained from ct images of 10 cm long cores the absolute air permeabilities of sample 1 and 2 were measured as 46 and 51 md more details on the permeability measurements of the samples can be seen in the supporting information fig s1 of si sample 3 was cut from a kentucky sandstone block virginia us with the long axis parallel to the bedding layers kocurek industries tx the porosity of sample 3 measured from ct images is 0 14 while the value from thin discs is 0 13 0 0012 the air permeability is measured as 6 67 md sample 4 a duperow dolostone was obtained from a depth of 1260 m from the wallewein 22 1 well a planned injection well for a co2 geological storage test at kevin dome montana the porosity of sample 4 was measured by water saturating under 101 kpa for 3 days until the time lapse ct images showed a constant porosity at 0 042 0 0012 the absolute air permeability for the sample was measured at 0 17 md table 1 lists the size porosity and permeability measurements on the four core samples fig 2a depicts the profile by blue curve of average porosity of 0 625 mm horizontal slices derived from x ray ct scans along the long axis with the background image showing the porosity distribution of a 2 d cross section along the central axis the porosity distribution of sample 4 by the x ray ct image indicates 1 a low porosity 0 02 to 0 04 portion p1 0 35 mm with two tight fractures 2 a low porosity 0 02 to 0 04 portion p2 35 to 55 mm with one open fracture and 3 a higher porosity 0 04 to 0 06 portion p3 55 to 95 mm with one tight fracture these fractures are marked by the white arrows in fig 2a and further discussed in section 3 3 the absolute water permeability of each sample in table 1 was converted from air permeability measurements considering klinkenberg effect klinkenberg 1941 jones and owens 1980 to quickly represent the sample characteristics we use high h medium m and low l permeability and bedding fracture orthogonal o to or parallel p to the water drainage path to redefine sample 1 ho 2 hp 3 mp and 4 lo we combine the sample name with the applied capillary pressure e g ho13 8 at an imposed capillary pressure of 13 8 kpa to denote an experiment water flow experiments were conducted in these samples with frequent x ray ct imaging to better understand the dynamic invasion drainage processes of co2 water and impacts of matrix properties with an aim to quantify the surface wettability of each sample we conducted contact angle measurements of a water droplet on the sample surface at ambient conditions the measured air water contact angles i e 21 2 6 22 2 0 22 0 7 and 46 0 9 for ho hp mp and lo respectively indicate that the four samples are water wet see more details in fig s2 of si the sandstone rocks ho and hp are composed mainly of quartz 90 and non swelling kaolinite 7 and we do not expect considerable changes of pore geometry after sample exposure to deionized di water sample mp is composed of quartz 61 feldspar 12 montmorillonite 15 and non swelling illite 12 although montmorillonite may potentially swell and reduce the matrix porosity and permeability its impacts on the co2 water flow in the fracture matrix system may not be pronounced due to the large contrast of capillary pressure saturation characteristics between fracture and matrix also note that we measured the sample porosities and characteristic curves pc s relations and conducted all of the water drainage experiments after fully saturating with di water thus the potential impacts from clay swelling have been compensated for sample lo is composed of calcite 70 dolomite 20 anhydrite 4 and clay 0 3 thus the impacts from exposure to di water were expected to be very small see more details on the sample mineralogy in tables s1 and s2 of si 2 2 experimental setup and procedures fig 2b presents a schematic of the experimental setup consisting of a reaction vessel and a pressure system that allows for co2 and water flow limited to a gauge pressure of 1035 kpa rocks were cored and end faces were sawn flat and sanded as smooth as necessary to fit into the acrylic core holder with an inner diameter of 5 08 cm and a length of 14 cm the core samples were maintained dry in an oven at 60 c prior to use the rock core was then pressed against a filter paper disk in contact with the capillary ceramic plate this arrangement was stabilized by a stiff spring at the top of the custom core holder two different types of ceramic plates soilmoisture equipment corp ca were used for samples ho and hp and samples mp and lo ceramics i and ii have a porosity of 0 45 and 0 34 a water absolute permeability of 6 0 and 0 17 md and a capillary entry pressure of 100 and 300 kpa respectively see table 1 the space between the vessel walls and the rock represents vertical fractures surrounding the matrix a single sheet of filter paper disk glass microfiber filter gf d whatman between the core bottom and the ceramic plate was used to simulate a horizontal fracture between the matrix blocks similar to stone et al 1992 the fracture thickness and porosity are 0 8 mm and 0 6 respectively while the fracture capillary pressure vs water saturation relations were measured and the dynamic co2 invasion into the top matrix block was monitored through frequent x ray ct scans see section 2 3 before each experiment the oven dried rock core filter paper and ceramic plate were first stacked and ct scanned in the reaction vessel the vessel was connected to vacuum at 101 kpa for over 2 h followed by di water injection through the bottom valve until the sample core was completely submerged in water the bottom valve was then closed and vacuum was maintained for 1 3 days depending on the samples used after saturating with water the ceramic plate established a threshold pressure for co2 invasion below which the plate will be fully saturated with water during the tests the pressure difference between co2 and water at atmospheric pressure was controlled and maintained higher than the capillary entry pressure of the rock core while lower than the value of the ceramic plate in this way the bottom ceramic plate was maintained fully water saturated verified by ct images at room pressure thus only downward drainage of water from the stacked column to the outlet through the bottom ceramic marked by the red arrow in fig 2b is expected during each experiment water between the rock core and vessel drained first allowing for co2 invasion at the top and from the circumferential surfaces of the rock core water desaturation in the horizontal fracture could also occur depending on the applied gauge pressures of co2 and capillary entry pressure of the fracture water was drained through the ceramic plate and the outflow tube into an outflow reservoir containing di water at the bottom the water outflow mass was monitored by weighing the outflow reservoir on a balance co2 was supplied to the vessel via a precise pressure regulator parker hannifin corp us at a resolution of 1 4 kpa from a 500d isco pump teledyne isco ne operated in a constant pressure mode the setup allows frequent x ray ct scans without disconnecting the reaction vessel from the pressure and drainage lines the vessel containing the core sample was oriented vertically to investigate potential gravity effects and positioned horizontally for very brief when compared to the time needed for drainage durations when an x ray ct scan was conducted a ge lightspeed 16 ct scanner was used to visualize the 3 d co2 distribution and image data were used to calculate co2 saturation at a voxel size of 0 1925 0 1925 0 625 mm3 scans in each experiment were performed at 120 kv and 160 ma each ct scan took 24 s which is short in relative to the time scale of fluid migration in the rock samples the sample porosity φ and co2 saturation s c o 2 in the rock core and the horizontal fracture during each test were obtained from background and experimental scans as given in the followings 1 ϕ c t w a t e r s a t c t d r y c t w a t e r c t a i r 2 s c o 2 c t w a t e r s a t c t exp c t w a t e r s a t c t d r y where ct is the ct number in hounsfield units computed for each voxel and that includes contributions from each pure component material present in the system i e air di water co2 and rock the ct watersat and ct dry refer to the ct values for each voxel of water saturated and oven dried core while ct exp is the ct value obtained at different times during each co2 displacement experiment the ct numbers of the two pure reference fluids water ct water 0 and air ct air 998 are known from previous calibration note that the two equations are derived originally from the linear attenuation coefficients μ the truly measurable quantity by x ray absorption and uses ct μ μwater μwater akin and kovscek 2003 they also imply that the ct number of a voxel can be expressed as the linear combination of the ct numbers associated with the volume fractions of each of its components this assumption is justified by the linear attenuation coefficient thus the ct number is proportional to the bulk density of materials for x ray energies above 100 kev wellington and vinegar 1987 peters and hardham 1990 pini and madonna 2016 in eq 2 the ct numbers of air saturated and co2 saturated core are assumed be equal since the similar density of co2 and air at the low imposed pressures in this study applying eqs 1 and 2 to each voxel x ray ct images have been widely used during core flood experiments to better understand the co2 water flow and displacement characteristics at the core and sub core scales perrin and benson 2009 shi et al 2011 krevor et al 2012 berg et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 xu et al 2020 in this study slice averaged properties were calculated using ct numbers averaged over a circular cross section slice the core porosity determined from x ray ct scans was comparable to that calculated gravimetrically from core mass changes at dried and saturated conditions 2 3 gas intrusion capillary pressures of matrix cores and fracture we cut thin disks 5 0 cm diameter and 1 0 cm thickness from core samples of each rock described above and measured their gas intrusion capillary pressures using the pressure plate method dane and hopmans 2002 tokunaga et al 2017 a 1500 kpa chamber soilmoisture equipment corp us was used and compressed nitrogen was supplied to the chamber via a two stage pressure regulator the outflow tube from the pressure plate led into the bottom of an outflow reservoir containing di water and the free surface of this reservoir was kept at the same level as the plate this method is well suited for directly controlling pc via changing pressure differences above a porous ceramic plate we assume no considerable impact of gases co2 or n2 on pc s measurements because of the similar interfacial tensions for co2 water 71 03 mn m at 100 kpa 25 c and n2 water 71 72 mn m at 12 mpa 25 30 c at the experimental pressure and temperature conditions massoudi and king 1974 chun and wilkinson 1995 the sample disks were initially saturated with di water and the applied pc and corresponding water saturations in the disks were monitored using a precise pressure gauge and by frequently weighing the disks the equilibrium water saturation in a sample for a particular pc was then determined at constant mass fig 3a b display the pc sw functions for samples ho hp and mp with error bars obtained from multiple sample disks for sample lo two thin disks were obtained from the rock plug at locations next to p1 and p3 while sampling from p2 was difficult due to the open fracture fig 3c shows the very different pc sw functions for p1 and p3 induced by potential micro fractures within the centimeter scale core sample mirzaei and das 2007 performed a comprehensive modeling sensitivity analysis on the micro heterogeneity effects on pc sw functions and conduced a non linear correlation between them depending highly on the distribution of micro heterogeneity for larger scale fracture matrix systems the co2 water flow and co2 storage efficiency would be collectively affected capillary and gravity forces ide et al 2007 in these systems impacts from fracture orientation connectivity and transmissibility relative to the matrix will be more pronounced the pc sw function of the horizontal fracture in the stacked columns was quantified through water drainage tests the fracture water saturations sw f under different applied pc were determined through x ray ct images fig 3d displays the pc sw f relation with error bars obtained from two repeated tests at 13 8 68 9 and 200 kpa the capillary pressure characteristics of both matrix cores and the horizontal fracture can be described by the van genuchten 1980 model as follows 3 p c 1 α s w s w r 1 s w r 1 m 1 1 m where s w r refers to the residual water saturation and α and m are fitting parameters table s3 of the si lists the fitting parameters of the van genuchten 1980 model with r 2 values higher than 0 99 the capillary entry pressure refers to the minimum pc required for co2 intrusion into the water saturated core sample or fracture which corresponds to the inflection point identified by the red arrows in the pc sw relations in fig 3 the values for samples ho hp and mp are measured as 13 8 13 8 135 kpa the pore size interpreted from the capillary entry pressures ranges from 1 10 μm which are consistent with the sandstone classifications from nelson 2009 for sample lo the capillary entry pressures are 135 and 66 kpa for p1 and p3 respectively while the value for the horizontal fracture is 41 4 kpa in the stacked column tests at pc 68 9 kpa we expect considerable fracture desaturation and concomitant reduction of capillary continuity between the top and bottom matrix blocks see section 3 3 the non zero non constant and porous medium like capillary pressure of the horizontal fracture in this study is representative of certain types of natural fractures due to 1 the large variations of fracture apertures 2 the complex geometry of a fracture network and 3 the wide presence of mineralization in fractures ramsay 1980 reported the observations of tectonically deformed crustal rocks and cracks and fissures filled with silicate or carbonate mineral the open microfractures filled with crystalline material derived from pressure solution in the rock matrix and chemical transfer of this material into the low pressure fluid filled space a mechanism termed crack seal morrow et al 1990 further reported the permeability measurements of the mineral filled fractures in the mesaverde formation rock samples which were of the same order as the surrounding matrix and presented water saturation dependent behavior similar to the porous matrix parry 1998 presented the fault fluid compositions and solubilities of the fracture sealing minerals while fletcher and merino 2001 summarized the published insights into the mineralization and crystal growth in rock fractures and proposed models on the coupling between mineral growth kinetics and mechanical response of the rock in summary the wide presence of mineralization in natural fractures and the resulting changes in fracture properties e g permeability capillary pressure and chemistry impose fracture pc sw functions similar to porous media resulting in a large range of contrast with matrix the co2 water flow fundamentals in these fractured porous media are of importance to gcs and other subsurface processes also note the capillary entry pressure of the fracture in the stacked columns is higher than that of the matrix in samples ho and hp this may reduce the effect of the water flow barrier of the fracture and help highlight the importance of capillary continuity the experiments still allow us to focus on co2 water displacements in these fracture matrix systems 2 4 water drainage experiments twelve water drainage experiments were conducted to investigate the co2 water displacements with controlled pc up to 200 kpa see table 2 five tests in the column stacked with samples ho ho13 8 ho30 7 ho27 6 ho41 4 and ho68 9 were conducted to investigate the fundamentals of co2 water flow and co2 saturation in matrix with high fracture water saturation thus high capillary continuity tests under varying imposed capillary pressures from 13 8 to 68 9 kpa were used to understand the impacts of capillary pressures two different comparison and sensitivity analyzes were conduced the first analysis focused on the effects of bedding orientation by two experiments with sample hp hp13 8 and hp41 4 maintaining similarly high capillary continuities in fracture for the second sensitivity analysis experiments were conduced targeting at water drainage across the single desaturated fracture thus reduced capillary continuity in sample mp mp150 mp200a mp200b as well as water drainage across multiple desaturated fractures in sample lo lo150 lo200 during the experiment the impacts of co2 dissolution and mass transfer is expected to be minimal because of 1 the low co2 solubility in water 0 068 mol l from zhao et al 2015 under the low pressure 200 kpa and temperature 25 c conditions in this study and 2 the very small impacts of co2 dissolution and mass transfer on two phase displacement and distribution under drainage conditions for instance in a previous study chang et al 2017 we investigated supercritical co2 scco2 water displacement and dissolution in an mm scale micromodel at 9 mpa and 40 c and monitored the co2 dissolution and mass transfer into residual water results showed overall constant co2 saturation after drainage and stable two phase distribution in the micromodel due to the continuous inflow of co2 although co2 dissolution occurred at the two phase interface is considerably higher 1 225 mol l at the elevated pressure and temperature 3 results 3 1 co2 water flow in the matrix with high fracture water saturation five drainage experiments were conducted in sample ho at varying pc from 13 8 to 68 9 kpa during each experiment dynamic co2 invasion and water drainage were monitored by frequent x ray ct scans and the images were used to calculate both slice and core average co2 water saturations at a number of times until a capillary quasi equilibrium was reached according to the pc sw f characteristics of the fracture in fig 3d fracture water desaturation to 0 68 0 96 is expected depending on the imposed pc values 3 1 1 dynamic water drainage and co2 saturation fig 4a shows selected time lapse images of 3 d co2 distribution purple color in test ho13 8 the numbers in the parentheses are experimental time and core average co2 saturations respectively also displayed in the figure the last sub image is the 3 d porosity distribution for comparison the temporal co2 distributions indicate preferential co2 uptake along multiple high porosity layers in contact with the circumferential surface the variations of the slice averaged co2 saturation along the core sample from top to bottom shown in fig 4b are overall consistent with those of porosity not in a perfect correlation however indicating porosity and pore size are not necessarily correlated the inconsistencies in correlation and offset of the peak co2 saturation vs porosity at some portions of the sample e g marked by the red dotted lines at 50 70 and 78 mm from the sample top in fig 4b could be attributed to the competition between different co2 fingers from the circumferential surface as shown in fig 4a co2 fingers developed preferentially along the high porosity layer at 38 mm which induced drainage of resident water towards the core bottom and resulted in the other co2 fingers to develop slightly beneath the peak porosity positions at 50 70 and 78 mm at the bottom portion of the core e g at 90 mm and close to the outlet the variations of co2 saturation are more consistent with those of porosity as water drainage pathway was shortest and easiest towards the outlet the core average co2 saturation increased with time for 78 h and remained relatively constant at 0 15 0 006 after exposure to co2 until 288 h when the experiment was stopped 3 1 2 effects of capillary pressure the pc effects on co2 water displacement in sample ho were investigated by specifying co2 pressures of 20 7 27 6 41 4 and 68 9 kpa while keeping water drainage pressure at atmospheric x ray ct images were obtained during each experiment until the co2 distribution and saturation in the core were stable with time fig 5 shows the co2 distributions at early time fig 5a 1 h and quasi equilibrium state fig 5b under the five capillary pressures when pc was increased above the capillary entry pressure of the core 13 8 kpa most co2 invaded into the rock along its circumferential surface preferentially through the higher porosity layers again not perfectly correlated this dominant circumferential inflow of co2 from the surrounding fractures can be attributed to the larger circumferential area compared to that of the top surface and reduced water drainage pathway towards the bottom fracture than axial flow from top for instance we observed high co2 saturations in the bottom portion of the core at 1 h where the water drainage pathway was shortest towards the outlet fig 5c d depict the core average co2 saturations vs time and variations of slice average values along the core at the quasi equilibrium state for each case we may infer that the core scale co2 saturations increase with increasing pc with more co2 uptake in the low porosity layers smoothing the co2 saturation variations along the core sample we also define a specific co2 saturation the ratio between temporal co2 saturation vs co2 saturation at capillary equilibrium and present the temporal changes of the value in the inserted sub image in fig 5c as the imposed capillary pressures are higher than the capillary entry pressure pc 13 8 kpa the temporal increases in the specific co2 saturation follow the similar trend and time scale to converge at the capillary equilibrium saturation as the dominant co2 invasion from the circumferential surface and water drainage in the normal direction this is different from 1 d two phase flow where confining pressure is applied and co2 water flow is prohibited across the circumferential surface the quasi equilibrium pc vs water saturation generally follows the pc sw curve obtained from disk measurements in fig 3a 3 2 effects of bedding orientations two flow experiments hp13 8 and hp41 4 were conducted in sample hp to better understand the impacts of matrix bedding orientations on co2 water displacement sample hp was cut parallel to the bedding with porosity variations from 0 15 to 0 16 along the long axis during these experiments high water saturations 0 60 were maintained in the horizontal fracture table 2 resulting in high capillary continuity for water drainage across the fracture fig 6a b present the dynamic co2 saturations and distributions in sample hp during the two experiments in both cases co2 preferentially invaded the core sample from one side high porosity and displaced resident water toward the opposite side low porosity where the displaced water migrated downward under single phase water flow condition during most of the experiment duration the core average co2 saturation was stable at 0 11 after 120 h in hp13 8 and 0 50 after 43 h in hp41 4 see fig 6c these quasi equilibrium co2 saturations are close to those 0 15 and 0 56 obtained in sample ho at the same pc values as should be expected the parallel bedding in sample hp however facilitated downward drainage of water and greatly shortened the time scale to reach equilibrium compared to that in sample ho at the same pc 41 4 kpa see table 2 3 3 water drainage across single desaturated fracture and fracture matrix interactions co2 water displacements after fracture desaturation were investigated in the column stacked with sample mp with a higher capillary entry pressure 135 kpa relative to the horizontal fracture 69 kpa for the two experiments mp150 and mp200a we expected 1 larger water desaturation in the fracture than that in the matrix see fig 3b and d and 2 considerable reduction in the capillary continuity of the fracture with increased water drainage resistance due to the blockage of water flow thus decreaze of water relative permeability across the bottom fracture by invaded co2 fig 7a b show the selected images of co2 distribution and co2 saturation along the core at different times for mp150 it can be seen that co2 initially invades the higher porosity portion of the core at the bottom close to the horizontal fracture and propagates upwards in the matrix this process may retard co2 invasion from the circumferential surface the core average co2 saturation increases with time and stabilizes at 0 24 after 264 h fig 7c the pair of specified pc and measured core scale co2 saturation follows the pc s curve measured from 1 cm thin disks in fig 2b the slice average co2 saturation shown in fig 7b however varies greatly from the top 0 18 to the bottom 0 30 indicating the impact of sub core scale heterogeneity in the 10 cm long core by the end of the experiment water saturation in the bottom fracture is 0 50 considerably higher than the value of 0 26 measured for the fracture pc sw f function in fig 3d also note the pronounced difference in equilibrium matrix co2 saturation between samples ho and hp vs sample mp at similar porosities and when maintaining sufficient fracture water saturation 0 5 the maximum storage capacity in samples ho and hp 0 60 at 68 9 kpa could be as much as 2 5 times higher than that in sample mp 0 24 at 150 kpa the unexpectedly high fracture water saturation in mp150 can be attributed to the countercurrent flow of co2 and water across the fracture matrix interface i e co2 invades the matrix core from the bottom fracture and water drains from the matrix core across the same interface to better understand the process we compared the co2 distribution in the bottom portion of the core next to the horizontal fracture fig 8a b with the water distribution within the fracture fig 8c d at early time 1 h and the end of the experiment 264 h once exposed to co2 the bottom fracture is invaded by co2 and resident water is partially displaced as indicated by the two black patches representing low fracture water saturations in fig 8c pc in these patches may exceed the capillary entry pressure of the matrix core above thus co2 invasion into the rock matrix is available at the same time drainage of water occurs downward next to the co2 flow pathway resulting in a high water saturation patch in the bottom fracture in fig 8c see the bright band in the middle note the consistent geometry of the high sw f patch vs co2 plume in the bottom portion of the core this high sw f patch hydraulically bridges the top core and bottom ceramic plate providing an efficient water drainage pathway across the fracture and allowing for continuous co2 invasion into the top core by the end of the experiment 264 h the wide invasion of co2 in the matrix fig 8b drained water more uniformly towards the fracture resulting in more distributed sw f in fig 8d to better understand the countercurrent flow of co2 and water at the fracture matrix interface we flipped the matrix core vertically and applied a higher pc 200 kpa in case mp200a in which the lower porosity portion was pressed against the fracture during the experiment sw f remained stable at 0 19 following the pc sw f relation in fig 3d but lower than the value 0 50 obtained in case mp150 this reduced sw f resulted in considerably different co2 distribution in the top core as shown in fig 9a co2 invasion initiated at the top high porosity portion however could not continuously propagate within the matrix instead the majority of co2 invaded from the circumferential surface at a reduced rate after 138 h of co2 in this case the core average co2 saturation increased slowly with time and we stopped the test at 1222 h before reaching the capillary equilibrium by the end of the experiment the core average co2 saturation is 0 16 lower than the value in mp150 0 24 although a higher pc was applied and maintained for a significant longer time see fig 9c we then conducted an additional drainage test mp200b in which the same pc 200 kpa was applied while the junctions between the surrounding and horizontal fractures were partially sealed by epoxy coating around the circumferential surface of the horizontal fracture the seal was not perfect as a crack developed within the thin epoxy layer when pressed the core against the ceramic plate but was able to reduce co2 invasion and increase fracture water saturation to 0 30 fig 9b c show the faster co2 invasion and higher co2 saturation in the core when compared to case mp200a under the same pc the three drainage experiments indicate that efficient co2 uptake in the matrix and water drainage across fracture are only possible when sufficient water saturation thus capillary continuity and water relative permeability is maintained in the horizontal fracture the capillary continuity of the fracture can be greatly enhanced by fracture matrix interactions through a countercurrent flow between co2 and water when 1 the pc and co2 water distribution are non uniform in the fracture and 2 the local pc exceeds the capillary entry pressure of matrix at the interface 3 4 co2 water drainage across multiple desaturated fractures we investigated the co2 uptake in the matrix and water drainage across a single fracture from a number of cases samples ho hp and mp in this section we present co2 water drainage across multiple horizontal fractures from two experiments lo150 and lo200 in the naturally fractured duperow dolostone sample lo sample lo is characterized by three alternating fracture matrix portions with capillary pressure contrasts shown in fig 3c fig 10a b show the temporal changes in core density relative to the initially water saturated condition after co2 exposure at pc 150 and 200 kpa calculating co2 saturations for each pixel using eq 2 resulted in considerable noise due to the low porosity nature of the core some pixels or portions of the sample were too tight to have distinguishable ct signal changes between ctwatersat and ctdry ctwatersat and ctexp noise was further amplified as ctwatersat ctdry 0 or negative was in the denominator of eq 2 to reduce the noise we converted ctwatersat and ctexp to density ρ watersat and ρ exp through a pre established correlation function and calculated density changes δρ ρ exp ρ watersat to represent the co2 invasion and water drainage in both figures brighter color refers to larger density reduction thus higher co2 saturation as shown in fig 10a b density reduction started in the four fractures at early time 8 5 h at pc 150 kpa and 6 h at 200 kpa followed by matrix density reduction until the end of experiments at 701 and 841 h a larger matrix density reduction was also observed in the bottom portion of the core at later times e g 262 5 h in fig 10a and 264 h in fig 10b in sample lo the low matrix porosity and permeability and high capillary entry pressure hindered fracture matrix interaction at the interface the fracture water saturations during the two experiments were measured at 0 26 and 0 21 following the fracture pc sw f relation shown in fig 3d we also calculated the slice average co2 saturation using eq 2 by averaging the ctexp ctwatersat ctdry values over 50 000 voxels in each slice and showed in fig 10c the variations along the core at the end of the two experiments from the figure we observed 1 higher co2 saturations in the four fractures validating the initial assumption of drainage occurring first in the fractures see the peaks marked by the black arrows 2 the overall co2 saturation in p3 was higher than that in p1 and p2 and 3 co2 saturation in p3 increases with increasing pc while it remained constant in p1 and p2 independent of the pc applied at pc 200 kpa the average co2 saturation in p3 was stable at 0 44 after 841 h exposure to co2 similar to the value of 0 45 obtained from thin disk pc sw measurements marked by the blue dashed line in fig 10c this indicated capillary equilibrium state in p3 the average co2 saturation in p1 however remained low 0 10 by the end of the two experiments note the gas saturation measured from thin disks at the capillary equilibrium state is higher at 0 25 marked by the blue dashed lines for p1 in fig 10c for water drainage from p1 the multiple desaturated fractures including the two in p2 p3 and the one beneath the matrix increased water flow resistance along the pathway thus considerably reduced the drainage efficiency at the experimental time scale at this point the fractures served as barriers for further co2 invasion into matrix similar to the modeling results from bogdanov et al 2003 who concluded that fractures can act as obstacles to the flow in their normal directions due to capillary effects by the end of the experiments the core average co2 saturations were measured as 0 29 and 0 19 at pc 150 and 200 kpa see fig 10d 4 discussion in sections 3 1 and 3 2 we investigated the co2 water flow in fracture matrix systems with high capillary continuity in the fracture in sections 3 3 and 3 4 two different comparison and sensitivity analyzes were conducted with reduced capillary continuities in the fracture and core samples having different properties these experiments were motivated by the long consideration of the assumption of the on off fashion and constant capillary entry pressure of natural fractures the single block concept has been widely adopted for modeling multiphase flow in fractured reservoirs through the well known dual porosity model warren and root 1963 in the model the drainage of matrix blocks by invading fluid occurs independently so that the performance of a stack of blocks is equal to the performance of a single block multiplied by the number of individual blocks theoretical analysis and examination of the field performance of some fractured reservoirs however indicate the existence of some capillary continuity between matrix blocks as 1 the existence of formation rocks that are not completely separated or isolated from other blocks by open natural fractures festoy and van golf racht 1989 liu and rutqvist 2010 and 2 bridging of matrix blocks by residual water in fractures that creates potential hydraulic connections for water drainage across the fractures sulak 1990 hermansen et al 1997 agarwal et al 1999 rangel german and kovscek 2006 rangel german et al 2006 firoozabadi 2000 de la porte et al 2005 fernø et al 2011 through a series of stacked block experiments horie et al 1990 and stones et al 1992 reported that the fracture capillary pressure is water saturation dependent and might have a functional form similar to that of a matrix reitsma and kueper 1994 measured the capillary pressure vs saturation in a single rough walled fracture which was well represented by a brooks corey porous media capillary pressure function with a distinct entry pressure observed the errors introduced when ignoring nonlinear kr curves and non zero pc in fractures were demonstrated by de la porte et al 2005 who presented that displacement efficiency could be underestimated by a factor of two when fracture capillary pressure was set to zero a detailed investigation is required which is one of the objectives in this study to better understand the impacts of the non constant porous like capillary pressure of fractures on co2 water drainage and co2 saturations in fracture matrix systems fig 11 summarizes the relationships of average matrix co2 saturation vs applied capillary pressure in stacked fracture matrix systems the bars bound the standard deviations of co2 saturation along the matrix cores calculated from each ct image slice 0 625 mm thickness the numbers in parenthesis in the figure represent the corresponding water saturations in the bottom fracture at steady state overall there exists a range of critical capillary pressure values below and above which the matrix co2 saturation vs capillary pressure relations are considerably different here when pc is low 100 kpa and fracture water saturations are high 0 6 the matrix co2 saturations in samples ho and hp increase with increasing pc depending on the matrix pc sw characteristics note the matrix co2 saturations vary by a larger span in sample ho indicated by the bars where the bedding layers are normal to the water drainage direction also recall the faster water drainage to the capillary quasi equilibrium state 43 h in sample hp at pc 41 4 kpa where bedding is parallel to the water drainage pathway compared to 145 h required for sample ho table 2 in sample hp co2 and water maintain high saturation along their individual pathways see fig 6 and thus high relative permeabilities for both fluids with frequent ct imaging we directly visualized the 3 d co2 water drainage in the stacked columns and indicated the impacts of matrix bedding orientations relative to the fracture that maintains high capillary continuity e g 0 50 to 0 96 when pc is higher and fracture water desaturation occurs e g 100 kpa in this study the reduced capillary continuity of the fracture hinders water drainage from and co2 invasion into the top matrix core thus matrix co2 saturation in sample mp decreases from 0 24 at a fracture water saturation of 0 50 in mp150 to 0 16 at a fracture water saturation of 0 19 in mp200a even when a higher pc was applied to the latter see fig 11 in mp150 the spatial and temporal changes in fracture water saturation vs matrix co2 saturation indicate the countercurrent flow of co2 and water at the fracture matrix interface compared to mp200b the fracture water saturation thus the capillary continuity of the fracture and matrix co2 saturation were enhanced by 1 the non uniform co2 water distribution in the fracture and 2 the lower capillary entry pressure of matrix relative to portions of the fracture see section 3 3 the highest matrix co2 saturation presented in mp200b when fracture water saturation and capillary pressure increased simultaneously by reducing the circumferential surface of fracture available to co2 invasion results from mp150 mp200a and mp200b indicate the complex co2 water flow across the fracture matrix interface and the importance of fracture and matrix properties e g the capillary entry pressures in determining co2 water flow in fractured porous media in previous modeling work we investigated the impacts of capillary continuity connectivity on co2 storage capacity and efficiency in meter scale stacked columns bandilla et al 2019 numerical simulations were conducted on stacked homogeneous matrix blocks with varying matrix matrix connectivities at 0 30 and 100 modeling results showed no considerable difference of co2 saturation distribution in the stacked columns for the cases of 30 and 100 matrix matrix connectivities while significant difference in co2 saturation distribution was observed between the 0 case and the 30 to 100 cases similar to the modeling results we showed that when capillary continuity determined by fracture water saturation is equal and over 0 3 case mp150 and mp200a co2 saturations in the top matrix are not considerably affected by the fracture whereas when the fracture water saturation is less than 0 3 case mp200b the matrix co2 saturation is greatly hindered over a longer period of time meanwhile our lab observations indicated a more complicated counter current flow at the fracture matrix interface as well as the pronounced impacts of matrix heterogeneity and anisotropy all these need to be considered for a more accurate predication of co2 storage efficiency in addition ţene et al 2017 investigated the two phase flow in fractured porous media using a projection based embedded discrete fracture model pedfm considering the fracture matrix coupling terms by a cross media transmissibility modeling results indicate the impacts of fracture positions and the cross media conductivity contrasts kim et al 2011 examined the experimental pc sw functions of heterogeneous carbonate rock samples and concluded that leverett j function cannot accurately describe the carbonate rocks due to heterogeneous pore systems with fractures and vugs the x ray ct images from this study directly visualized the dependence of co2 water flow and pc sw functions on fractures and matrix and indicated that single leverett j function may not be applicable in scaling pc sw functions for field scale studies considering the orders of magnitude difference between fracture and matrix permeability at last differing from the columns stacked with a single fracture samples ho hp and mp tests in sample lo with multiple horizontal fractures present 1 the largest variations of co2 saturation within the core fig 11 and 2 the four fractures orthogonal to the water drainage direction served as conduits for co2 invasion at early time they however hindered water drainage across and further co2 invasion from these fractures into neighboring matrix fig 10 these can be attributed to the increased water flow resistance thus decreased water relative permeability across the desaturated fractures while the co2 water flow within a fracture or fracture network has been investigated by laboratory experiments and modeling shukla et al 2010 perera et al 2011 oh et al 2013 celia et al 2015 march et al 2018 tao et al 2019 cross fracture flow is worthy of a systematic and detailed investigation results from sample lo imply the spatial and temporal dependent role of fractures for 3 d co2 water flow the importance of fracture network e g distribution orientation connectivities and transmissibility characteristics with respect to the matrix in determining co2 distribution and storage efficiency common to all cases above is the observed higher co2 saturation at the bottom portion of the matrix cores 1 in samples ho and hp with high fracture continuity regardless of matrix anisotropy and applied pc e g figs 5 and 6 and 2 in samples mp and lo where fractures were desaturated and capillary continuity was considerably reduced figs 7 and 10 this cannot be predicted by the dual porosity approach that assumes zero capillary continuity through the fracture warren and root 1963 or observed by the classic core flood experiments where confining pressure is applied and co2 water flow is prohibited across the circumferential surface perrin and benson 2009 krevor et al 2012 chang et al 2013 2014 pini and benson 2013 in our experiments the 3 d displacement enables co2 invasion through the bottom fracture into matrix and countercurrent water drainage from the matrix this may benefit the fracture matrix flow and mass transfer and co2 storage efficiency in fractured reservoirs 5 conclusions and implications recent modeling results have demonstrated significant co2 storage efficiency in fractured reservoirs when preferentially drained fractures retain certain hydraulic capillary continuity in this study we investigated the co2 water flow across an mm scale fracture and storage efficiency in rock matrix at room temperature and controlled capillary pressures up to 200 kpa frequent x ray ct scans provided direct observations on the processes and show the importance of fracture capillary continuity and fracture matrix interactions we observed the increase of displacement efficiency in the matrix with increasing fracture water saturation capillary continuity and presented that the fracture water saturations could be enhanced by the non uniform fracture capillary pressure and countercurrent flow of co2 and water across the fracture matrix interface the displacement efficiency was also affected by matrix heterogeneity and anisotropy when high fracture water saturations 0 6 were maintained in naturally fractured reservoirs the interfacial tension of co2 water is expected to be considerably lower than that under the experimental conditions in this study in addition fractures develop with a wider range of apertures from microns to much larger while individual fractures may also contain spatially variable apertures microns to millimeters these might collectively result in spatially variable and a larger span of capillary pressure contrasts between fractures vs matrix while cautions are needed before applying the experimental results to the field this study implies that tight fractures and tight portions of a rough fracture may sustain high water saturation allowing for water drainage across multiple matrix blocks and co2 invasion from large fractures the cross fracture flow of water may bridge the preferentially drained fractures ahead of the co2 plume and enhance co2 storage efficiency in matrix in summary adequate capillary continuity of fractures and fracture matrix interactions may result in continuous displacement that occurs over multiple matrix blocks to an extent that the single block based dual porosity model may greatly underestimate the co2 storage efficiency in fractured reservoirs credit authorship contribution statement chun

258,depth to water table dwt for an unconfined aquifer affects a wide range of hydrological ecological and agricultural problems such as soil salinization plant type and crop output in a world without human impacts dwt in shallow groundwater zones is mainly driven by evapotranspiration and precipitation in the real world however human impacts on groundwater hydrological processes are ubiquitous which hinders one to fully understand the natural groundwater hydrological rule the purpose of this study is to derive an analytical solution of precipitation evapotranspiration driven dwt irrespective of the human impacts through pretreatment of practical data to eliminate human impacts we show that the proposed method is efficient in dealing with the real world problems specifically we establish a mathematical model describing impacts of periodic evapotranspiration and precipitation on dwt an innovative quasi analytical solution using the fourier series is developed and analyzed in detail based on the model this study indicates that the amplitude of dwt is correlated linearly with the amplitude of precipitation and quadratically with the amplitude of potential evapotranspiration the phase position of dwt is subject to the phase lag between the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in arid regions the evapotranspiration has a greater influence on the phase of dwt than the precipitation this quasi analytical solution is limited for a shallow groundwater situation in which dwt is less than the extinction depth of groundwater evapotranspiration keywords groundwater evapotranspiration periodicity amplitude phase fourier series 1 introduction the difference between groundwater recharge and discharge drives spatial variation in groundwater elevation which is the basic processe driving groundwater flow yeh et al 2015 it directly affects a wide range of hydrological ecological environmental and agricultural processes for example the rising groundwater level can increase the risk of soil salinization jin et al 2019 in contrast the groundwater pumping cost increases and land subsidence may occur with the falling groundwater level du et al 2018 therefore it is essential to study mechanism driving variations in the depth to water table dwt under realistic natural or anthropogenic conditions berendrecht et al 2006 zhang and wang 2020 zhao et al 2020 lurtz et al 2020 groundwater replenishment can be recharged through precipitation infiltration lateral replenishment in front of mountains and replenishment of surface water bodies groundwater can be discharged by evaporation spillover of spring water direct discharge to surface water and artificial discharge in natural conditions i e without anthropogenic impact precipitation and evapotranspiration are the main recharge and discharge mechanisms of groundwater respectively and they primarily control variations of dwt in a shallow unconfined aquifer setting yeh and famiglietti 2009 unfortunately both precipitation and evapotranspiration are highly variable in space and time and difficult to predict accurately posing significant challenges for quantifying their impacts most existing studies analyze relations between dwt and precipitation and evaporation or predict dwt through time series methods du et al 2020 li et al 2017 a few articles give expressions for dwt driven by periodic precipitation and evaporation the first step to quantify dwt is to search for proper functions that can consistently describe variations of precipitation and evapotranspiration for instance soylu et al 2012 found the periodic behavior of evapotranspiration from shallow groundwater in new mexico and nebraska usa using a series of sine functions with different frequencies de la casa et al 2018 also described the periodic behavior of precipitation using a sine function sequence in argentina because of the seasonal behavior of evapotranspiration and precipitation dwt usually varies seasonally as well jasechko et al 2014 gnann et al 2020 simultaneously our field observation data in wushen county the inner mongolia autonomous region china also showed periodic features of potential evapotranspiration fig 1 and precipitation fig 2 such observational data inspired us to investigate the mechanism on how periodic evapotranspiration and precipitation affect shallow groundwater because very few studies focus on analytical solutions of dwt driven by such periodic forces the purpose of this work is to develop a new mathematical model to investigate impacts of periodic evapotranspiration and precipitation on dwt through analytical solutions specifically we obtain analytical solutions of periodic dwt using known functions of precipitation and groundwater dependent evapotranspiration such solutions fulfill the knowledge gap in this field and are useful for quick assessment of groundwater dynamics in response to temporally varying precipitation and evapotranspiration and for benchmarking associated numerical models 2 shallow groundwater model 2 1 conceptual model as showed in fig 3 a the one dimensional horizontal groundwater flow in an isotropic unconfined aquifer can be described by the boussinesq equation bear 1972 as follows 1 μ h t x k h h x w where x and t are distance in horizontal l and time t respectively h is the relative water table height l μ is the specific yield k is the hydraulic conductivity lt 1 w is the net recharge of groundwater lt 1 in this study we assume a flat extending aquifer with a uniform recharge and a uniform water table in which the lateral flow can be ignored i e h x 0 is satisfied then we have 2 μ h t μ d d d t w where d l is dwt as illustrated in fig 3 a for a shallow groundwater system the unsaturated layer above the water table has a limited thickness thus the change in the water storage capacity of the unsaturated layer is regarded as secondary and will not be impacted appreciably by precipitation and evapotranspiration processes hence the net groundwater recharge in this situation is determined by 3 w p t e t a where eta represents the actual evapotranspiration rate on the land surface lt 1 p t is the precipitation intensity lt 1 thenthe change in dwt can be expressed as 4 μ dd dt e t a p t as illustrated in fig 3 b eta is dependent on dwt and can be expressed as soylu et al 2011 5 e t a e t min e t g where et min is the minimum evapotranspiration lt 1 and etg denotes the contribution of groundwater evapotranspiration lt 1 for a specific area the ratio of et min to the potential evapotranspiration e 0 can be considered as a constant soylu et al 2011 and estimated as 6 e t min λ e 0 t where λ yields the weight of the residual evapotranspiration when water table is significantly deep 0 λ 1 groundwater evapotranspiration etg is proportional to the rest of the potential evapotranspiration 1 λ e 0 and a function of dwt as 7 e t g 1 λ e 0 t f d where f d is an empirical formula for groundwater evapotranspiration for example the averianov formula averianov 1956 is adopted in this study 8 f d 1 d d max n 0 d d max f d 0 d d

etg function chen et al 2013 according to eqs 5 6 and 8 the evapotranspiration can be empirically modeled as 9 e t a e 0 t λ 1 λ 1 d d max n 0 d d max e t a λ e 0 t d d max in this study we focus on the situation of 0 d d max by substituting eq 9 into eq 4 we obtain a single dynamic equation 10 μ d d d t e 0 t λ 1 λ 1 d d max n p t 0 d d max a variety of trigonometric functions have accurately represented the periodicity of rainfall and evapotranspiration for example de la casa et al 2018 used a trigonometric function to represent periodic fluctuation of rainfall soylu et al 2012 calculated daily and longer groundwater evapotranspiration consumption using a moving multiday sine function gnann et al 2020 used a sine function to approximate precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration based on observed data of the precipitation fig 2 and potential evaporation fig 1 in the wushen county inner mongolia autonomous region china we use the following sinusoidal periodic functions to describe e 0 t 11 e 0 t e 0 1 sin 2 π t t e t p t p 1 sin 2 π t t p t where e 0 and p are the average values equal to the amplitudes of e 0 t and p t respectively lt 1 te and tp are the phase offset times of e 0 and p respectively t and t is the period t substituting eq 11 into eq 10 we have the final dynamic equation 12 μ d d d t e 0 1 sin 2 π t t e t λ 1 λ 1 d d max n p 1 sin 2 π t t p t note that dwt is limited within 0 d d max 2 2 transformation eq 12 will be used to predict the change in dwt using known precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data to slove this equation we first estimate the average location of stable state and transform eq 12 into an offset equation with d p e 0 representing the average values of dwt precipitation and potential evaporation respectively at the mean annual scale applying dd dt 0 into eq 10 we arrive at 13 e 0 λ 1 λ 1 d d max n p 0 solving eq 13 for d yields 14 d d max d max 1 1 λ p e 0 λ 1 n based on this average value we define the offset functions as follow 15 f t d t d 16 e t e 0 t e 0 17 p t p t p then eq 10 is transformed into the following offset equation 18 μ df dt e t λ 1 λ 1 d d max f d max n p t 1 λ e 0 1 d d max f d

cos 2 i π τ b i sin 2 i π τ a 0 2 i 1 n a i cos 2 i π τ b i sin 2 i π τ where n is the truncated number for an approximation and ai and bi are defined by 22 a i 2 1 2 1 2 g τ cos 2 i π τ d τ i 0 1 2 b i 2 1 2 1 2 g τ sin 2 i π τ d τ i 1 2 we solve a 0 a 1 b 1 by undetermined coefficients method wei et al 2016 when eq 21 is truncated to n 1 the detailed derivation processes are given in appendix b the analytical expressions of a 0 a 1 and b 1 are 23 a 0 2 4 t 1 λ e 0 p t 1 λ e 0 sin 2 π φ d max π μ sin 2 π φ 8 d max 2 π 2 μ 2 t 2 1 λ 2 e 0 2 λ e 0 p 24 a 1 2 t λ 1 e 0 p sin π φ 4 d max π μ sin

eq 20 is obtained according to eqs 15 and a2 we obtain the approximate analytical solution of d t as follows 26 d t d max d max d a 0 2 a 1 cos 2 π t t e t b 1 sin 2 π t t e t for simplifying eq 26 we need to determine the sign of b 1 which can be obtained from transferring eq 25 into 27 b 1 η k λ e 0 p where 28 η sin π φ sin π φ arctan 2 d max π μ t 1 λ e 0 29 k 4 t 1 λ e 0 p t λ 1 e 0 2 2 d max π

d t d max d max d a 0 2 d max d a 1 2 b 1 2 sin 2 π t t e t θ where tan θ a 1 b 1 4 d max π μ sin π φ t λ 1 e 0 cos π φ 4 d max π μ cos π φ 2 t λ 1 e 0 sin π φ 4 d max π μ tan π φ t λ 1 e 0 4 d max π

find that ad has a linear positive correlation with the amplitude of precipitation and a parabolic relationship with the amplitude of evapotranspiration through eq 30 we estimate the phase position of d t as 35 γ d 2 π t t e t θ from eq 11 the phases of evapotranspiration and precipitation are γ e and γ p 36 γ e 2 π t t e t γ p 2 π t t p t defining the phase difference between d t and e 0 t as θ e and defining the phase difference between d t and p t as θ p we have 37 θ e θ θ p 2 π φ θ based on eqs 35 and 36 we reach two conclusions firstly the expressions of the phase lags of dwt with evapotranspiration and precipitation θ e and θ p are independent of p so the amplitude of precipitation does not affect the phase difference the phase lags of dwt θ e and θ p are mainly controlled by the peak and period of the potential evapotranspiration secondly when precipitation lag evapotranspiration i e ϕ 0 in eq 36 the phase difference between dwt and the precipitation is generally larger than the phase difference between dwt and the potential evapotranspiration therefore when the peak of the precipitation occurs later than the peak of the potential evapotranspiration the peak time of dwt will be closer to the peak time of the potential evapotranspiration 4 applications and discussions 4 1 synthetic cases with numerical verification to verify the solution and double check the characteristic curves of amplitude and phase of dwt we compare the quasi analytical solution with the numerical solution obtained using the euler method in two synthetic cases this numerical method has been proven to be reasonable by chen 2014 the iteration formula is as follows 38 d k 1 d k δ t μ p k 1 δ t μ e 0 k 1 λ 1 λ 1 d k d max n in practice the time step δt is much smaller than the periodicity of evaporation and precipitation in the synthetic cases we use empirical parameter values with respect to arid case 1 and humid case 2 regions the empirical variables for arid and humid areas are case1 e 0 0 20 cm d p 0 10 cm d te 80 d tp 130 d λ 0 2 t 365 d d max 600 cm μ 0 06 case2 e 0 0 25 cm d p 0 22 cm d te 60 d tp 62 d λ 0 1 t 365 d d max 600 cm μ 0 06 for the case1 we obtain dwt using eqs 23 25 with a 0 2 35 a 1 0 10 b 1 0 35 the estimated d value with the unit cm is then given by 39 d t d max d max d a 0 2 a 1 cos 2 π t t e t b 1 sin 2 π t t e t 335 26 23 44 cos 2 365 π t 80 79 47 sin 2 365 π t 80 similarly the dwt in the case 2 is obtained as follows 40 d t 76 54 1 13 cos 2 365 π t 60 6 92 sin 2 365 π t 60 the periodic patterns of the potential evapotranspiration and precipitation in case 1 and 2 are illustrated in figs 4 a and c respectively the approximate analytical and numerical solutions of case 1 and 2 are compared in fig s 4 b and d respectively the fourier method directly obtains a steady state periodic solution the numerical model has to be preheated for at least 1000 d to reduce the influence of arbitrary initial conditions for the final steady state periodic results the relative error of the approximate analytical solution relative to the numerical one is less than 2 both case 1 and 2 it demonstrates that the approximate analytical solution performs very well for both arid case 1 and humid case case 2 to check the validity of using n 1 in eq 21 we also carry out a more complicated estimate with n 2 and compare the result with that of n 1 as indicated both results of n 1 and n 2 are very close to each other with a relative difference less than 2 this agreement justifies the use of n 1 4 2 discussions on the amplitude of dwt according to eq 31 the amplitude of dwt is an integrated result of variations in precipitation and the potential evapotranspiration which are expressed as 41 a d case 1 150 p 41 78 20 45 e 0 26 49 e 0 2 1 20 e 0 2 42 a d c a s e 2 0 07 p 204656 5115 39 e 0 108008 e 0 2 0 95 e 0 2 wheread case1 and ad case2 are the amplitudes of dwt in case 1 and case 2 in the unit of cm respectively eqs 41 and 42 show that the amplitude of dwt is proportional to the mean precipitation and is a parabolic function of the mean potential evapotranspiration noticing that e 0 0 20 cm d in case 1 and 0 25 cm d in case 2 are empirical values for arid and humid areas one has 43 a d case 1 828 57 p a d case 2 31 88 p similarly for acquiring the effects of evapotranspiration on amplitude of dwt let p 0 1 cm d in eq 43 and p 0 22 cm d in eq 44 respectively we have eq 44 44 a d c a s e 1 15 41 78 20 45 e 0 26 49 e 0 2 1 20 e 0 2 a d c a s e 2 0 02 204656 5115 39 e 0 108008 e 0 2 0 95 e 0 2 then we plot how the amplitude of dwt varies with that of precipitation and evapotranspiration individually and how the amplitude of dwt varies with the combined effects of evapotranspiration and precipitation fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 a and d that with an increase of precipitation amplitude the amplitude of dwt increases linearly from fig 5 b and e one can see that as the evapotranspiration amplitude increases the amplitude of dwt decreases parabolically fig 5 c and f illustrate combined effects of the amplitudes of precipitation and evapotranspiration on the amplitude of dwt it reemphasizes that the response of amplitude of dwt to precipitation amplitude is positive and linear meanwhile the response of amplitude of dwt to evapotranspiration amplitude is parabolic irrespective of in arid or humid regions i e the case 1 and 2 moreover the response of amplitude of dwt to precipitation amplitude are larger than to evapotranspiration amplitude 4 3 discussions on the phase shift of groundwater depth from eqs 35 and 36 the phase of dwt evapotranspiration and precipitation are listed below 45 γ d case 1 0 29 2 365 π t 80 γ d case 2 0 16 2 365 π t 60 46 γ e case 1 2 π 365 t 80 γ e case 2 2 π 365 t 60 47 γ p case 1 2 π 365 t 130 γ p case 2 2 π 365 t 62 where γ d case1 and γ d case2 represent the phase of dwt in case 1 and case 2 respectively similarly γ e case1 and γ e case2 denote the phase of evapotranspiration in case 1 and case 2 respectively γ p case1 and γ p case2 are the phase of precipitation in case 1 and case 2 respectively fig 6 a shows that the phase of dwt lags evaporation in the arid region suggesting that evapotranspiration dominates the subsurface water balance in the arid area evaporation not only affects the amount of groundwater recharge but also dominates the phase of groundwater elevation due to the fact that precipitation occurs occasionally with small amounts in arid regions evaporation dominates the variation of dwt causing the variation of groundwater table in advance of precipitation fig 6b on the other hand fig 6c and d show that the phase between dwt and precipitation and evapotranspiration are almost in sync in humid regions these facts indicate that dwt is driven by both precipitation and evaporation in humid areas although a minimal difference in the location on the phase of dwt precipitation and evaporation these small differences are nonnegligible these differences reflect the lag of dwt relative to precipitation and evaporation 5 applications to a real world example in china a groundwater observation well bh5 is located at 108 07 e and 38 23 n in the wushen county inner mongolia autonomous region china fig 7 shallow groundwater exists in an unconfined aquifer that is composed of quaternary sediments at the site the observation well penetrates into the aquifer at a depth of about 85 m a water level logger is installed which records the daily dwt from 2018 to 2010 we have also collected monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data at the site from wang and zhou 2016 the monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data from january 2007 to december 2011 shown in figs 1 and 2 are used to estimate dwt during the period 2008 2009 from the approximate analytical solution in this study we fit the potential evapotranspiration rate using the following function 48 e 0 t 3 181 1 sin 2 π t 95 79 365 it is difficult to faithfully fit the monthly precipitation with a single sinusoidal curve as a simplification we perform the 5 month moving average on the precipitation data and then fit the smoothed data fig 2 with 49 p t 0 992 1 sin 2 π t 133 41 365 the corresponding observed groundwater data are showed in fig 8 in reality the change in groundwater level is a complicated issue resulting from numerous factors including precipitation evapotranspiration regional flow and groundwater utilization to investigate the average variation patterns we also use the 5 month moving average method to construct a quasi periotic dwt regime at the site fig 8 the physically based parameters are determined according to the regional hydrogeological conditions chen et al 2013 wang and zhou 2016 d max 3 6 m μ 0 13 and λ 0 12 accordingly the closed form d t function obtained from the approximate solution in this study is 50 d t 2 745 0 0328 cos 2 π t 95 79 365 0 139 sin 2 π t 95 79 365 where the unit of t is day as shown in fig 8 our solution basically captures general patterns of dwt represented by the 5 month smoothing data the determination coefficient r 2 is 0 88 indicating a high correlation between the analytical solution and the 5 month smoothing data this shows that our analytical model has the potential capacity in explaining periodical changes of dwt in shallow groundwater zones where the periodical precipitation and evapotranspiration are main forces of groundwater dynamics the limitation for applications also exists the quasi analytical solution obtained by the fourier method can effectively capture the long term stable behavior of the dynamic system but cannot describe the initial transient phenomenon although we obtain the explicit expression of dwt it is under the condition of n 1 when n 1 the solution process is more complicated and further research is needed specifically the quasi analytical solution is suitable for shallow groundwater areas where dwt is less than the extinction depth of groundwater evapotranspiration precipitation and potential evaporation with periodic variations 6 conclusions based on the quasi analytical solution of precipitation and evapotranspiration driven dwt and its application to a synthetic case we arrive at the following conclusions 1 the amplitude of precipitation has linear impacts on amplitude of dwt the larger fluctuation of precipitation is the larger fluctuation of dwt differently the amplitude of evapotranspiration affects the amplitude of dwt in a parabolic relationship 2 the phase lags between dwt and evapotranspiration and precipitation are influenced by the peak amplitude of evapotranspiration and phase lag between precipitation and evapotranspiration in arid regions evapotranspiration has a greater influence on the phase lag than precipitation on the other hand in humid region evapotranspiration and precipitation affect the phase in synchrony the phase lags between dwt and evapotranspiration and precipitation are influenced by the peak amplitude of evapotranspiration and phase lag between precipitation and evapotranspiration in arid regions evapotranspiration dominates the subsurface water balance manifested by the fact that the phase of evapotranspiration is in advance of dwt lags simultaneously due to the fact that precipitation occurs occasionally with small amounts precipitation is the secondary factor impacting dwt comparing with evapotranspiration so the phase of precipitation is left behind of the depth groundwater table under control of evapotranspiration 3 the quasi analytical solution of dwt is suitable for shallow groundwater areas where the dwt is less than the extinction depth of groundwater evapotranspiration

258,depth to water table dwt for an unconfined aquifer affects a wide range of hydrological ecological and agricultural problems such as soil salinization plant type and crop output in a world without human impacts dwt in shallow groundwater zones is mainly driven by evapotranspiration and precipitation in the real world however human impacts on groundwater hydrological processes are ubiquitous which hinders one to fully understand the natural groundwater hydrological rule the purpose of this study is to derive an analytical solution of precipitation evapotranspiration driven dwt irrespective of the human impacts through pretreatment of practical data to eliminate human impacts we show that the proposed method is efficient in dealing with the real world problems specifically we establish a mathematical model describing impacts of periodic evapotranspiration and precipitation on dwt an innovative quasi analytical solution using the fourier series is developed and analyzed in detail based on the model this study indicates that the amplitude of dwt is correlated linearly with the amplitude of precipitation and quadratically with the amplitude of potential evapotranspiration the phase position of dwt is subject to the phase lag between the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in arid regions the evapotranspiration has a greater influence on the phase of dwt than the precipitation this quasi analytical solution is limited for a shallow groundwater situation in which dwt is less than the extinction depth of groundwater evapotranspiration keywords groundwater evapotranspiration periodicity amplitude phase fourier series 1 introduction the difference between groundwater recharge and discharge drives spatial variation in groundwater elevation which is the basic processe driving groundwater flow yeh et al 2015 it directly affects a wide range of hydrological ecological environmental and agricultural processes for example the rising groundwater level can increase the risk of soil salinization jin et al 2019 in contrast the groundwater pumping cost increases and land subsidence may occur with the falling groundwater level du et al 2018 therefore it is essential to study mechanism driving variations in the depth to water table dwt under realistic natural or anthropogenic conditions berendrecht et al 2006 zhang and wang 2020 zhao et al 2020 lurtz et al 2020 groundwater replenishment can be recharged through precipitation infiltration lateral replenishment in front of mountains and replenishment of surface water bodies groundwater can be discharged by evaporation spillover of spring water direct discharge to surface water and artificial discharge in natural conditions i e without anthropogenic impact precipitation and evapotranspiration are the main recharge and discharge mechanisms of groundwater respectively and they primarily control variations of dwt in a shallow unconfined aquifer setting yeh and famiglietti 2009 unfortunately both precipitation and evapotranspiration are highly variable in space and time and difficult to predict accurately posing significant challenges for quantifying their impacts most existing studies analyze relations between dwt and precipitation and evaporation or predict dwt through time series methods du et al 2020 li et al 2017 a few articles give expressions for dwt driven by periodic precipitation and evaporation the first step to quantify dwt is to search for proper functions that can consistently describe variations of precipitation and evapotranspiration for instance soylu et al 2012 found the periodic behavior of evapotranspiration from shallow groundwater in new mexico and nebraska usa using a series of sine functions with different frequencies de la casa et al 2018 also described the periodic behavior of precipitation using a sine function sequence in argentina because of the seasonal behavior of evapotranspiration and precipitation dwt usually varies seasonally as well jasechko et al 2014 gnann et al 2020 simultaneously our field observation data in wushen county the inner mongolia autonomous region china also showed periodic features of potential evapotranspiration fig 1 and precipitation fig 2 such observational data inspired us to investigate the mechanism on how periodic evapotranspiration and precipitation affect shallow groundwater because very few studies focus on analytical solutions of dwt driven by such periodic forces the purpose of this work is to develop a new mathematical model to investigate impacts of periodic evapotranspiration and precipitation on dwt through analytical solutions specifically we obtain analytical solutions of periodic dwt using known functions of precipitation and groundwater dependent evapotranspiration such solutions fulfill the knowledge gap in this field and are useful for quick assessment of groundwater dynamics in response to temporally varying precipitation and evapotranspiration and for benchmarking associated numerical models 2 shallow groundwater model 2 1 conceptual model as showed in fig 3 a the one dimensional horizontal groundwater flow in an isotropic unconfined aquifer can be described by the boussinesq equation bear 1972 as follows 1 μ h t x k h h x w where x and t are distance in horizontal l and time t respectively h is the relative water table height l μ is the specific yield k is the hydraulic conductivity lt 1 w is the net recharge of groundwater lt 1 in this study we assume a flat extending aquifer with a uniform recharge and a uniform water table in which the lateral flow can be ignored i e h x 0 is satisfied then we have 2 μ h t μ d d d t w where d l is dwt as illustrated in fig 3 a for a shallow groundwater system the unsaturated layer above the water table has a limited thickness thus the change in the water storage capacity of the unsaturated layer is regarded as secondary and will not be impacted appreciably by precipitation and evapotranspiration processes hence the net groundwater recharge in this situation is determined by 3 w p t e t a where eta represents the actual evapotranspiration rate on the land surface lt 1 p t is the precipitation intensity lt 1 thenthe change in dwt can be expressed as 4 μ dd dt e t a p t as illustrated in fig 3 b eta is dependent on dwt and can be expressed as soylu et al 2011 5 e t a e t min e t g where et min is the minimum evapotranspiration lt 1 and etg denotes the contribution of groundwater evapotranspiration lt 1 for a specific area the ratio of et min to the potential evapotranspiration e 0 can be considered as a constant soylu et al 2011 and estimated as 6 e t min λ e 0 t where λ yields the weight of the residual evapotranspiration when water table is significantly deep 0 λ 1 groundwater evapotranspiration etg is proportional to the rest of the potential evapotranspiration 1 λ e 0 and a function of dwt as 7 e t g 1 λ e 0 t f d where f d is an empirical formula for groundwater evapotranspiration for example the averianov formula averianov 1956 is adopted in this study 8 f d 1 d d max n 0 d d max f d 0 d d

etg function chen et al 2013 according to eqs 5 6 and 8 the evapotranspiration can be empirically modeled as 9 e t a e 0 t λ 1 λ 1 d d max n 0 d d max e t a λ e 0 t d d max in this study we focus on the situation of 0 d d max by substituting eq 9 into eq 4 we obtain a single dynamic equation 10 μ d d d t e 0 t λ 1 λ 1 d d max n p t 0 d d max a variety of trigonometric functions have accurately represented the periodicity of rainfall and evapotranspiration for example de la casa et al 2018 used a trigonometric function to represent periodic fluctuation of rainfall soylu et al 2012 calculated daily and longer groundwater evapotranspiration consumption using a moving multiday sine function gnann et al 2020 used a sine function to approximate precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration based on observed data of the precipitation fig 2 and potential evaporation fig 1 in the wushen county inner mongolia autonomous region china we use the following sinusoidal periodic functions to describe e 0 t 11 e 0 t e 0 1 sin 2 π t t e t p t p 1 sin 2 π t t p t where e 0 and p are the average values equal to the amplitudes of e 0 t and p t respectively lt 1 te and tp are the phase offset times of e 0 and p respectively t and t is the period t substituting eq 11 into eq 10 we have the final dynamic equation 12 μ d d d t e 0 1 sin 2 π t t e t λ 1 λ 1 d d max n p 1 sin 2 π t t p t note that dwt is limited within 0 d d max 2 2 transformation eq 12 will be used to predict the change in dwt using known precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data to slove this equation we first estimate the average location of stable state and transform eq 12 into an offset equation with d p e 0 representing the average values of dwt precipitation and potential evaporation respectively at the mean annual scale applying dd dt 0 into eq 10 we arrive at 13 e 0 λ 1 λ 1 d d max n p 0 solving eq 13 for d yields 14 d d max d max 1 1 λ p e 0 λ 1 n based on this average value we define the offset functions as follow 15 f t d t d 16 e t e 0 t e 0 17 p t p t p then eq 10 is transformed into the following offset equation 18 μ df dt e t λ 1 λ 1 d d max f d max n p t 1 λ e 0 1 d d max f d

derivation details are provided in appendix a and the result is given by 19 d g τ d τ β 1 1 sin 2 π τ g n λ 1 sin 2 π τ p α e 0 sin 2 π τ φ β 1 where τ and g are respectively the dimensionless time

cos 2 i π τ b i sin 2 i π τ a 0 2 i 1 n a i cos 2 i π τ b i sin 2 i π τ where n is the truncated number for an approximation and ai and bi are defined by 22 a i 2 1 2 1 2 g τ cos 2 i π τ d τ i 0 1 2 b i 2 1 2 1 2 g τ sin 2 i π τ d τ i 1 2 we solve a 0 a 1 b 1 by undetermined coefficients method wei et al 2016 when eq 21 is truncated to n 1 the detailed derivation processes are given in appendix b the analytical expressions of a 0 a 1 and b 1 are 23 a 0 2 4 t 1 λ e 0 p t 1 λ e 0 sin 2 π φ d max π μ sin 2 π φ 8 d max 2 π 2 μ 2 t 2 1 λ 2 e 0 2 λ e 0 p 24 a 1 2 t λ 1 e 0 p sin π φ 4 d max π μ sin

eq 20 is obtained according to eqs 15 and a2 we obtain the approximate analytical solution of d t as follows 26 d t d max d max d a 0 2 a 1 cos 2 π t t e t b 1 sin 2 π t t e t for simplifying eq 26 we need to determine the sign of b 1 which can be obtained from transferring eq 25 into 27 b 1 η k λ e 0 p where 28 η sin π φ sin π φ arctan 2 d max π μ t 1 λ e 0 29 k 4 t 1 λ e 0 p t λ 1 e 0 2 2 d max π

find that ad has a linear positive correlation with the amplitude of precipitation and a parabolic relationship with the amplitude of evapotranspiration through eq 30 we estimate the phase position of d t as 35 γ d 2 π t t e t θ from eq 11 the phases of evapotranspiration and precipitation are γ e and γ p 36 γ e 2 π t t e t γ p 2 π t t p t defining the phase difference between d t and e 0 t as θ e and defining the phase difference between d t and p t as θ p we have 37 θ e θ θ p 2 π φ θ based on eqs 35 and 36 we reach two conclusions firstly the expressions of the phase lags of dwt with evapotranspiration and precipitation θ e and θ p are independent of p so the amplitude of precipitation does not affect the phase difference the phase lags of dwt θ e and θ p are mainly controlled by the peak and period of the potential evapotranspiration secondly when precipitation lag evapotranspiration i e ϕ 0 in eq 36 the phase difference between dwt and the precipitation is generally larger than the phase difference between dwt and the potential evapotranspiration therefore when the peak of the precipitation occurs later than the peak of the potential evapotranspiration the peak time of dwt will be closer to the peak time of the potential evapotranspiration 4 applications and discussions 4 1 synthetic cases with numerical verification to verify the solution and double check the characteristic curves of amplitude and phase of dwt we compare the quasi analytical solution with the numerical solution obtained using the euler method in two synthetic cases this numerical method has been proven to be reasonable by chen 2014 the iteration formula is as follows 38 d k 1 d k δ t μ p k 1 δ t μ e 0 k 1 λ 1 λ 1 d k d max n in practice the time step δt is much smaller than the periodicity of evaporation and precipitation in the synthetic cases we use empirical parameter values with respect to arid case 1 and humid case 2 regions the empirical variables for arid and humid areas are case1 e 0 0 20 cm d p 0 10 cm d te 80 d tp 130 d λ 0 2 t 365 d d max 600 cm μ 0 06 case2 e 0 0 25 cm d p 0 22 cm d te 60 d tp 62 d λ 0 1 t 365 d d max 600 cm μ 0 06 for the case1 we obtain dwt using eqs 23 25 with a 0 2 35 a 1 0 10 b 1 0 35 the estimated d value with the unit cm is then given by 39 d t d max d max d a 0 2 a 1 cos 2 π t t e t b 1 sin 2 π t t e t 335 26 23 44 cos 2 365 π t 80 79 47 sin 2 365 π t 80 similarly the dwt in the case 2 is obtained as follows 40 d t 76 54 1 13 cos 2 365 π t 60 6 92 sin 2 365 π t 60 the periodic patterns of the potential evapotranspiration and precipitation in case 1 and 2 are illustrated in figs 4 a and c respectively the approximate analytical and numerical solutions of case 1 and 2 are compared in fig s 4 b and d respectively the fourier method directly obtains a steady state periodic solution the numerical model has to be preheated for at least 1000 d to reduce the influence of arbitrary initial conditions for the final steady state periodic results the relative error of the approximate analytical solution relative to the numerical one is less than 2 both case 1 and 2 it demonstrates that the approximate analytical solution performs very well for both arid case 1 and humid case case 2 to check the validity of using n 1 in eq 21 we also carry out a more complicated estimate with n 2 and compare the result with that of n 1 as indicated both results of n 1 and n 2 are very close to each other with a relative difference less than 2 this agreement justifies the use of n 1 4 2 discussions on the amplitude of dwt according to eq 31 the amplitude of dwt is an integrated result of variations in precipitation and the potential evapotranspiration which are expressed as 41 a d case 1 150 p 41 78 20 45 e 0 26 49 e 0 2 1 20 e 0 2 42 a d c a s e 2 0 07 p 204656 5115 39 e 0 108008 e 0 2 0 95 e 0 2 wheread case1 and ad case2 are the amplitudes of dwt in case 1 and case 2 in the unit of cm respectively eqs 41 and 42 show that the amplitude of dwt is proportional to the mean precipitation and is a parabolic function of the mean potential evapotranspiration noticing that e 0 0 20 cm d in case 1 and 0 25 cm d in case 2 are empirical values for arid and humid areas one has 43 a d case 1 828 57 p a d case 2 31 88 p similarly for acquiring the effects of evapotranspiration on amplitude of dwt let p 0 1 cm d in eq 43 and p 0 22 cm d in eq 44 respectively we have eq 44 44 a d c a s e 1 15 41 78 20 45 e 0 26 49 e 0 2 1 20 e 0 2 a d c a s e 2 0 02 204656 5115 39 e 0 108008 e 0 2 0 95 e 0 2 then we plot how the amplitude of dwt varies with that of precipitation and evapotranspiration individually and how the amplitude of dwt varies with the combined effects of evapotranspiration and precipitation fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 a and d that with an increase of precipitation amplitude the amplitude of dwt increases linearly from fig 5 b and e one can see that as the evapotranspiration amplitude increases the amplitude of dwt decreases parabolically fig 5 c and f illustrate combined effects of the amplitudes of precipitation and evapotranspiration on the amplitude of dwt it reemphasizes that the response of amplitude of dwt to precipitation amplitude is positive and linear meanwhile the response of amplitude of dwt to evapotranspiration amplitude is parabolic irrespective of in arid or humid regions i e the case 1 and 2 moreover the response of amplitude of dwt to precipitation amplitude are larger than to evapotranspiration amplitude 4 3 discussions on the phase shift of groundwater depth from eqs 35 and 36 the phase of dwt evapotranspiration and precipitation are listed below 45 γ d case 1 0 29 2 365 π t 80 γ d case 2 0 16 2 365 π t 60 46 γ e case 1 2 π 365 t 80 γ e case 2 2 π 365 t 60 47 γ p case 1 2 π 365 t 130 γ p case 2 2 π 365 t 62 where γ d case1 and γ d case2 represent the phase of dwt in case 1 and case 2 respectively similarly γ e case1 and γ e case2 denote the phase of evapotranspiration in case 1 and case 2 respectively γ p case1 and γ p case2 are the phase of precipitation in case 1 and case 2 respectively fig 6 a shows that the phase of dwt lags evaporation in the arid region suggesting that evapotranspiration dominates the subsurface water balance in the arid area evaporation not only affects the amount of groundwater recharge but also dominates the phase of groundwater elevation due to the fact that precipitation occurs occasionally with small amounts in arid regions evaporation dominates the variation of dwt causing the variation of groundwater table in advance of precipitation fig 6b on the other hand fig 6c and d show that the phase between dwt and precipitation and evapotranspiration are almost in sync in humid regions these facts indicate that dwt is driven by both precipitation and evaporation in humid areas although a minimal difference in the location on the phase of dwt precipitation and evaporation these small differences are nonnegligible these differences reflect the lag of dwt relative to precipitation and evaporation 5 applications to a real world example in china a groundwater observation well bh5 is located at 108 07 e and 38 23 n in the wushen county inner mongolia autonomous region china fig 7 shallow groundwater exists in an unconfined aquifer that is composed of quaternary sediments at the site the observation well penetrates into the aquifer at a depth of about 85 m a water level logger is installed which records the daily dwt from 2018 to 2010 we have also collected monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data at the site from wang and zhou 2016 the monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data from january 2007 to december 2011 shown in figs 1 and 2 are used to estimate dwt during the period 2008 2009 from the approximate analytical solution in this study we fit the potential evapotranspiration rate using the following function 48 e 0 t 3 181 1 sin 2 π t 95 79 365 it is difficult to faithfully fit the monthly precipitation with a single sinusoidal curve as a simplification we perform the 5 month moving average on the precipitation data and then fit the smoothed data fig 2 with 49 p t 0 992 1 sin 2 π t 133 41 365 the corresponding observed groundwater data are showed in fig 8 in reality the change in groundwater level is a complicated issue resulting from numerous factors including precipitation evapotranspiration regional flow and groundwater utilization to investigate the average variation patterns we also use the 5 month moving average method to construct a quasi periotic dwt regime at the site fig 8 the physically based parameters are determined according to the regional hydrogeological conditions chen et al 2013 wang and zhou 2016 d max 3 6 m μ 0 13 and λ 0 12 accordingly the closed form d t function obtained from the approximate solution in this study is 50 d t 2 745 0 0328 cos 2 π t 95 79 365 0 139 sin 2 π t 95 79 365 where the unit of t is day as shown in fig 8 our solution basically captures general patterns of dwt represented by the 5 month smoothing data the determination coefficient r 2 is 0 88 indicating a high correlation between the analytical solution and the 5 month smoothing data this shows that our analytical model has the potential capacity in explaining periodical changes of dwt in shallow groundwater zones where the periodical precipitation and evapotranspiration are main forces of groundwater dynamics the limitation for applications also exists the quasi analytical solution obtained by the fourier method can effectively capture the long term stable behavior of the dynamic system but cannot describe the initial transient phenomenon although we obtain the explicit expression of dwt it is under the condition of n 1 when n 1 the solution process is more complicated and further research is needed specifically the quasi analytical solution is suitable for shallow groundwater areas where dwt is less than the extinction depth of groundwater evapotranspiration precipitation and potential evaporation with periodic variations 6 conclusions based on the quasi analytical solution of precipitation and evapotranspiration driven dwt and its application to a synthetic case we arrive at the following conclusions 1 the amplitude of precipitation has linear impacts on amplitude of dwt the larger fluctuation of precipitation is the larger fluctuation of dwt differently the amplitude of evapotranspiration affects the amplitude of dwt in a parabolic relationship 2 the phase lags between dwt and evapotranspiration and precipitation are influenced by the peak amplitude of evapotranspiration and phase lag between precipitation and evapotranspiration in arid regions evapotranspiration has a greater influence on the phase lag than precipitation on the other hand in humid region evapotranspiration and precipitation affect the phase in synchrony the phase lags between dwt and evapotranspiration and precipitation are influenced by the peak amplitude of evapotranspiration and phase lag between precipitation and evapotranspiration in arid regions evapotranspiration dominates the subsurface water balance manifested by the fact that the phase of evapotranspiration is in advance of dwt lags simultaneously due to the fact that precipitation occurs occasionally with small amounts precipitation is the secondary factor impacting dwt comparing with evapotranspiration so the phase of precipitation is left behind of the depth groundwater table under control of evapotranspiration 3 the quasi analytical solution of dwt is suitable for shallow groundwater areas where the dwt is less than the extinction depth of groundwater evapotranspiration

259,in hydrological modelling traditionally one calibration was performed over a certain calibration period before the model is used to study the hydrological system this implies that a constant model structure and parameterization are assumed however if the catchment system is subject to changes that are not incorporated in the model the parameter values found in a calibration period may not be optimal for other periods which is called systemic change the aim of this study was to identify systemic change and its possible causes with the pcr globwb hydrological model in the rhine meuse basin by performing a brute force calibration for multiple periods for five calibration locations between 1901 2010 systemic change was studied for the main model components by selecting a key parameter from each component minimum soil depth fraction saturated hydraulic conductivity groundwater recession coefficient degree day factor manning s n these parameters were calibrated for 10 year rolling periods between 1901 2010 the results showed that at the downstream locations the changes in optimal parameter values were small while at the upstream locations the optimal values of most parameters changed considerably over the different rolling calibration periods signifying systemic change especially the degree day factor showed large variations varying over time between 0 5 and 2 5 times its default value at basel and maxau upstream and middle part of the rhine basin based on correlation analysis it was found that climate change as well as changes in land use and river structure are possible causes of changes in optimal parameter values through time keywords systemic change hydrological modelling parameter stability pcr globwb model rhine meuse basin 1 introduction the amount of damage caused by riverine flooding has increased over the past years due to population growth and economic development in flood prone areas winsemius et al 2016 on top of that anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability may change atmospheric processes and as a consequence the occurrence of riverine floods hall et al 2014 to be able to adapt to the consequences of climate change more knowledge is needed on how hydrological systems respond to changing conditions blöschl et al 2019 hydrological models can help to improve system understanding and to simulate future systems to support decision making however due to a lack of data or process understanding hydrological models need some sort of parameterization to perform well arsenault et al 2018 which is why hydrological models are often calibrated i e finding parameter values that result in the best fit between model output and historic observations of the catchment in hydrological modelling traditionally one calibration with discharge measurements or possibly additional hydrological information e g fernandez palomino et al 2020 ilampooranan et al 2021 melišová et al 2020 is performed over a certain period after which the model is validated with observations of another period split sample test klemeš 1986 pechlivanidis et al 2011 this method implies the modeller assumes that the model equations and parameters are stationary however fundamental changes in behaviour of the modelled system represented by the model equations can occur over time that are not represented by the used model structure or parameterization these changes can therefore not be simulated and may result in model output that deviates from observed values we refer to this problem as systemic change following verstegen et al 2016 the assumption of a stationary system used in split sample testing becomes invalid under systemic changes and can cause large deviations in hydrological forecasts coron et al 2012 merz et al 2011 especially because hydrological models often behave highly nonlinear peel and blöschl 2011 it is therefore increasingly recognized in hydrology that hydrological model equations and parameter values cannot be naively transferred to changing conditions thirel et al 2015 if an hydrological model is calibrated for different periods and the optimal model parameter values vary over these periods this can have several causes merz et al 2011 westra et al 2014 first changes in the catchment may have occurred that are not incorporated in the model processes like climate change peel and blöschl 2011 land use change pathiraja et al 2016 and the construction of hydrological structures like dikes hall et al 2014 can affect the hydrological system and therefore affect the optimal model parameter values in different calibration periods if these processes are not incorporated in the model secondly if the used representation of catchment processes is too simplistic the model may not be able to simulate the discharge under changing conditions wagener et al 2003 in addition model calibration partly compensates for error or bias in input and or observational data so if these error terms are not constant through time performing calibration over different periods may imply different optimal model parameter values beven and binley 1992 westra et al 2014 several studies have been carried out to determine the effect of climate change and land use change on optimal model parameter values merz et al 2011 determined the time stability of optimal parameter values for six 5 year periods between 1976 and 2006 in 273 austrian catchments and found considerable variation in optimal snow and soil moisture parameter values sleziak et al 2018 used three 10 year periods between 1981 and 2010 to determine how hydrological models perform under different climate conditions and found that the optimal model parameter values varied over these periods especially for the parameters related to snow and soil moisture processes pathiraja et al 2016 studied the effect of deforestation on optimal model parameter values and found that the values of parameters related to groundwater and surface routing changed in response to deforestation to account for a decrease in percolation and a faster peak discharge however these studies assessed relatively short time spans e g 30 to 40 years and small study areas 6200 km2 while non stationarity may become more apparent when taking longer periods or larger river basins due to long term or large scale processes peel and blöschl 2011 also existing studies often explore systemic change in a limited set of hydrologic system components while the focus is often on a small set of possible environmental drivers of systemic change the latter is an important limitation as systemic change can be due to a range of possible causes including and not restricted to climate change land use change and basin management thus an analysis studying these changes simultaneously over large time spans in large basins as well as smaller subbasins is needed to determine the possible causes of systemic change and to prevent incorrect conclusions regarding causal relations the aim of this study is therefore to identify systemic change and its possible causes for a large river basin and a long period with pcr globwb 2 0 a global hydrological model sutanudjaja et al 2018 van beek and bierkens 2009 van beek et al 2011 the rhine meuse basin 200 000 km2 was chosen as study area because discharge and meteorological observations are available for more than 100 years this results in the following research questions i provided the pcr globwb 2 0 model has systemic change occurred in the rhine meuse basin in the last century if yes in what parameters when and how abrupt ii what is the variation in systemic change if present between sub basins and iii what is the relation of systemic changes if present with changes in climate land use and river structures this study contributes to the existing literature as follows the long study period 100 years provides the opportunity to detect long term slow systemic changes in the hydrological system allowing for a better understanding of how the hydrological system will change to anthropogenic climate change and land use change in the future this is especially relevant for climate change studies that use global large scale hydrological models in a simplified manner in addition most existing studies have a relatively small study area and the use of the rhine meuse basin 200 000 km2 through which systemic change can be studied at larger scales furthermore the comparison of trends in optimal parameter values between different sub basins within the large rhine meuse basin allows for the assessment of spatial variation in systemic change and the relations between these different sub basins e g upstream vs downstream 2 methods in summary the pcr globwb hydrological model sutanudjaja et al 2018 van beek and bierkens 2009 van beek et al 2011 section 2 2 is run for the rhine meuse basin section 2 1 between 1901 and 2010 to perform a brute force calibration of five parameters sections 2 3 and 2 4 measured discharge data are used to calibrate the model at basel maxau lobith cochem and borgharen representing different parts and tributaries of the rhine meuse basin to be able to identify the temporal stability of the optimal parameter values the model is calibrated in three different ways default model no calibration is performed and pcr globwb is run with its default parameterization one calibration the model is run with 576 different parameter sets to determine the optimal parameter values for 1901 2010 rolling calibration the model is run with 576 different parameter sets to determine the optimal parameter values for each 10 year rolling calibration period i e 1901 1910 1902 1911 1903 1912 2001 2010 this last calibration method results in a time series of 101 optimal parameter value sets which is analysed for trends as an indication for systemic change the trends in optimal parameter values at different locations were then compared to patterns in meteorological forcing data land use data and qualitative data on the construction of river structures to identify possible causes of the systemic changes section 2 5 2 1 study area the rhine meuse basin with a basin area of approximately 185 000 km2 the river rhine is one of the larger rivers in europe it originates in the swiss alps and flows through several countries i a switzerland germany and the netherlands after which it ends in the north sea the discharge at the river mouth is on average about 2300 m3 s of which almost 50 comes from the area upstream of basel schmitt et al 2018 in the most upstream part the discharge largely depends on glacial and snow melt while the more downstream sub catchments have a combined rainfall snowmelt regime the meuse basin has an area of approximately 35 000 km2 and is located in france belgium luxembourg germany and the netherlands de niel et al 2017 the discharge of the meuse is on average about 350 m3 s and the river is mainly fed by rain this results in high winter discharge and very low summer discharge about 25 of winter discharge de wit et al 2007 the study area contains the combined rhine meuse basin but excludes the delta area in the netherlands in this study area the meuse catchment is therefore not a sub catchment of the rhine but a separate catchment the total rhine meuse basin covers approximately 200 000 km2 fig 1 the rhine has always been an important river due to its economic and cultural relevance schmitt et al 2018 but with a notable flood risk that has increased over the past decennia murawski et al 2016 it is expected that the regime will change from a combined rainfall snowmelt regime to a more rainfall dominated regime which is likely to cause an increase in the occurrence of extreme high and low flow hurkmans et al 2009 2 2 model and input data the model used in this study was pcr globwb 2 0 a global hydrological model sutanudjaja et al 2018 van beek and bierkens 2009 van beek et al 2011 this second version of the model is available in a 5 arcminute as well as in a 30 arcminute resolution and simulates the terrestrial water balance on a daily time step although a 5 arcminute resolution would arguably result in a closer representation of the real system a 30 arcminute resolution was chosen for this study to save computation time for the parameters the standard input data and parameterisation of pcr globwb 2 0 as described in sutanudjaja et al 2018 was used this is largely the same as the parameterisation given in van beek and bierkens 2009 for pcr globwb 1 0 the model was run from 1901 to 2010 corresponding to the availability of the discharge measurements used as observational data in the calibration section 2 4 the model consists of 5 modules the meteorological forcing module the land surface module the groundwater module the surface water routing module and the irrigation and water use module in these modules pcr globwb calculates with a daily time step the water storage in two soil layers with a maximum thickness of respectively 0 3 and 1 2 m and the underlaying groundwater layer in addition the exchange between these layers snow storage interception storage and the atmosphere is calculated the meteorological forcing data set of pcr globwb 2 0 consists of monthly precipitation temperature and reference evaporation data from the cru ts 3 2 data set harris et al 2014 from the climate research unit of the university of east anglia because the model uses daily time steps the forcing data was downscaled to daily values with era 20c poli et al 2016 for a more detailed description of the model and its default parameterization refer to sutanudjaja et al 2018 2 3 calibration parameters five model parameters are calibrated the degree day factor f d m c 1day 1 saturated hydraulic conductivity k s 1 k s 2 mday 1 minimum soil depth fraction f groundwater recession coefficient j 1 day 1 and manning s n n m5 6s 1 table 1 these parameters were selected in such a way that each component of the hydrological system is represented which allows an evaluation of the occurrence of systemic changes in these different components for each component the most important parameter was selected based on sutanudjaja et al 2014 and lópez lópez et al 2017 although including more parameters could result in a better fit between modelled and observed discharge it would also result in a rapid increase in computation time needed for the brute force calibration pcr globwb uses a temperature index model to simulate snow melt this means that the degree day factor f d m c 1day 1 is used to model snow melt as 2 1 s c m e l t f d t t m e l t where sc melt is the amount of snow melt m t is the actual temperature c and t melt is the temperature at which snow will melt c wada et al 2014 the degree day factor determines therefore the amount of snow melt per degree day the default value for the degree day factor in pcr globwb is 2 5 mm c 1day 1 sutanudjaja et al 2018 the minimum soil depth fraction f is used in pcr globwb to partition the net liquid water reaching the soil consisting of snowmelt and rainfall into direct runoff overland flow above the soil and infiltration to the soil such partitioning processes are conceptualized based on the distribution of soil saturation in each grid cell and following the improved arno scheme hagemann gates 2003 todini 1996 the fraction of saturated soil in a grid cell x is given by sutanudjaja et al 2014 van beek bierkens 2009 2 2 x 1 w m a x w a c t w m a x w m i n b b 1 where w max m is the total storage capacity of all soil layers w min m is the minimum storage capacity of the soil layer w act m is the actual storage of all soil layers and the exponent parameter b defines the distribution of soil water storage capacities within a cell in pcr globwb w max and w min are related through the minimum soil depth fraction f as 2 3 w m i n w m a x f for grid cells with f 0 and therefore w min 0 direct runoff always occurs for a rainfall event if w min 0 no direct runoff occurs as long as w act does not exceed w min the minimum soil depth fraction depends on the land cover type and location and has therefore different values for tall natural vegetation short natural vegetation non paddy irrigated crops and paddy irrigated crops throughout the basin in the rhine meuse basin the minimum soil depth fraction has a value ranging between 0 11 and 0 88 for tall natural vegetation between 0 00 and 0 50 for short natural vegetation between 0 75 and 0 88 for non paddy irrigated crops and 0 75 for paddy irrigated crops the default values of f for the tall natural vegetation i e forest land cover are shown in fig 2 as an example the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s 1 k s 2 mday 1 of the first and second soil layer were calibrated simultaneously they are used in pcr globwb to respectively simulate the transport from the first soil layer to the second soil layer and from the second soil layer to the groundwater layer the amount of infiltration or capillary rise depends on the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the degree of saturation in the soil layers this means that the saturated hydraulic conductivity determines how much water can infiltrate into the soil and therefore the amount of runoff the values of the standard parameterization of the model were derived from the digital soil map of the world fao 1998 and tabulated data van beek and bierkens 2009 over the rhine meuse basin the saturated hydraulic conductivity varies between 0 14 and 3 14 mday 1 at the first soil layer and 0 10 and 2 36 mday 1 at the second soil layer fig 2 the groundwater recession coefficient j 1 day 1 is used in the groundwater module to quantify the linear relation between groundwater storage and outflow sutanudjaja et al 2018 the default value of the groundwater recession coefficient depends on aquifer and flow network properties and is computed with the drainage theory of kraijenhoff van de leur 1958 and lithological maps dürr et al 2005 the default value of the groundwater recession coefficient varies between 0 003 and 0 054 day 1 fig 2 manning s n n m5 6s 1 is a roughness coefficient to simulate the kinematic wave routing in pcr globwb the kinematic wave is an approximation of the saint venant equations where the flow is described by the manning s equation the default value of manning s n is set to 0 04 m5 6s 1 for the entire area which is a commonly assumed value for natural rivers chow 1959 2 4 calibration and sensitivity analysis the model was calibrated using a brute force calibration technique meaning that the model was run for all possible parameter combinations given a certain step size table 2 for the 1901 2010 period since the minimum soil depth fraction the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the groundwater recession coefficient are spatially variable the calibration is performed by multiplying the parameter value in each cell with a multiplication factor to retain the spatial pattern of the parameters the step size for the multiplication factors follows a linear constant step size scale with multiplication factors of 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 except for the saturated hydraulic conductivity and groundwater recession coefficient which follow a logarithmic scale because these parameters vary naturally over multiple orders of magnitude table 2 this means that these parameters vary with 10a where a is the multiplication factor given in table 2 the multiplication factors for these parameters is 0 5 0 0 and 0 5 combining all these parameter sets results in a total of 576 parameter value combinations that are used for calibration to gain more insight into the effect of variation in the parameter values on the hydrograph a sensitivity analysis was carried out for each of the selected parameters minimum soil depth fraction saturated hydraulic conductivity groundwater recession coefficient degree day factor and manning s roughness coefficient hereto we applied a one at a time sensitivity analysis by running the model for different values for each parameter table 2 while the other parameters are set to their default values for these parameter combinations the mean yearly average the mean yearly standard deviation and the mean yearly 95 and 5 percentile of the discharge were calculated in addition the resulting hydrographs were plotted for a single year 1930 to show how sensitive the discharge is to the changing parameters which is important information when interpreting the parameter trends through time the sensitivity analysis was performed for basel representing the upstream areas of the basin and lobith representing the downstream areas to compare the effect of the parameters on the discharge at different subcatchments of the study area to determine the optimal parameter value combinations of the brute force calibration simulated discharge values were compared to observed discharge values from the global runoff data centre grdc http www bafg de grdc at basel rhine maxau rhine lobith rhine cochem moselle and borgharen meuse the objective function used to determine the optimal parameter values was the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 which is a decomposition of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and measures correlation variability and bias to determine the overall model s skill the kge was chosen instead of the often used nse because the nse tends to underestimate runoff peaks due to an underestimation of the discharge variability gupta et al 2009 in this study three calibration scenarios were compared the first scenario is no calibration at all which means the discharge is modelled with the default parameterization of pcr globwb which we called the default model next the model was calibrated once for the entire 1901 2010 period by choosing the parameter value combination with the highest kge for this whole period referred to as one calibration in addition to determine how the optimal parameter values vary over time the model was calibrated for consecutive 10 year rolling periods 10 year periods were used instead of one year periods because some processes like groundwater respond over larger time scales by considering at 10 year periods the calibration period is larger than the residence time of the groundwater this means that the optimal parameter combination was determined with the objective function evaluated for 1901 1910 1902 1911 1903 1912 or 2000 2010 lavenne et al 2016 which we call the rolling calibration this resulted in 101 optimal parameter value sets one for each period represented by its central year 2 5 identifying systemic change and its causes next the optimal parameter values of the one calibration and rolling calibration were compared to the default model optimal parameter values are the parameter values forming the ensemble of the 10 highest kge values for each calibration period this ensemble was used instead of the single optimal parameter value because one optimal parameter is still for a large part subject to randomness especially when the kge values are close together the mean and standard deviation of the parameter values in this ensemble were plotted for each 10 year rolling calibration period after which they were visually inspected to detect parameter trends through time potential variations in optimal parameter values through time are an indication of systemic change this method was repeated for all five calibration locations basel maxau lobith cochem and borgharen and the parameter trends were compared for these locations to determine the spatial variation of systemic change in the rhine meuse basin however because the saturated hydraulic conductivity minimum soil depth fraction and groundwater recession coefficient are spatially variable the multiplication factors were used for further calculations in the next steps instead of the actual optimal parameter values even though the parameters of the default model and one calibration scenarios do not change through time their kge values were calculated for each 10 year rolling calibration period this enables a comparison of the performances of the default model one calibration and the rolling calibration scenarios for each 10 year rolling calibration period to evaluate the model performance flow duration curves i e plot of exceedance probability vs discharge were plotted for the different calibration scenarios following yilmaz et al 2008 and pfannerstill et al 2014 the mean discharge of the 5 and 95 percentile segments and their bias with the measured discharge was computed for these calibration scenarios in addition hydrographs were plotted for the observed discharge the default model one calibration and rolling calibration in order to compare the model performance on different aspects of the hydrograph for the rolling calibration a discharge series is created by combining the years in the middle of the rolling calibration periods e g 1905 from 1901 1910 and 1906 from 1902 1911 because the middle years represent the surrounding rolling calibration period best to reduce the number of figures plots are shown only for basel and lobith respectively representing the upstream and the combined downstream and upstream part of the basin figures for the other locations are presented in the digital supplement to determine potential causes of systemic change the optimal parameter value trends are compared to trends in meteorological forcing data from the cru ts 3 2 data set harris et al 2014 and land use change from the hyde 3 2 data set klein goldewijk et al 2011 in addition to the standard meteorological forcing data from pcr globwb temperature precipitation and reference potential evapotranspiration also the amount of snowfall defined as the amount of precipitation that falls when the temperature is below 0 c and the 90 percentile precipitation were calculated to give more insight into the changing precipitation patterns isotta et al 2014 these values were averaged over the upstream area of each calibration location and over each calibration period to be able to match them to the optimal parameter values furthermore the optimal parameter value trends are compared to trends in land use areas from hyde the hyde 3 2 database contains the area of cropland grazing and urban area and an uncertainty range for each 5 arcminute grid cell at 10 year intervals between 1900 and 2010 i e 1900 1910 1920 etc to be able to compare the land use types for the different calibration locations the total area of vegetation cover per grid cell was converted to a fraction by dividing the value by the total cell area in addition the dataset was upscaled to a 30 arcminute resolution for the rhine meuse basin with a nearest neighbour interpolation as with the meteorological data the upstream average value was calculated for each calibration location the trends in climate variables and land use were compared to the trends in optimal parameter values by creating scatter plots for the different calibration locations the correlation coefficient r was calculated for each parameter climate variable land use type combination to indicate the correlation between these factors again only the figures for basel and lobith are shown the other locations are included in the digital supplement 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis changing parameter values affect the hydrograph in different ways at different locations fig 3 digital supplement i the minimum soil depth fraction groundwater recession coefficient and manning s n all have a similarly small effect on the hydrograph at basel but at lobith the differences in discharge between the parameter multiplication factors are larger a decrease in the multiplication factor of manning s n causes for example a delay in the modelled peak discharge at lobith the saturated hydraulic conductivity and degree day factor have a large effect on the hydrograph compared to the other parameters as can be expected a decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity results in a peakier discharge at both basel and lobith the effect of changing the degree day factor is most visible during spring and early summer as a decrease in degree day factor causes a later peak discharge in spring the one at a time sensitivity analysis shows that the saturated hydraulic conductivity has a relatively large effect on the mean and extreme discharge values at all locations compared to the other parameters digital supplement ii in addition the minimum soil depth fraction has a larger effect on the mean than on the extreme discharges the degree day factor is more sensitive at the upstream locations basel maxau than at the downstream locations cochem borgharen fig 3 sensitivity analysis of the calibration parameters on the hydrograph for the year 1930 at basel left and lobith right the different rows show different parameters where the multiplication factors colours of that parameter change while the other parameters remain constant for the sensitivity analysis at the other locations refer to digital supplement i 3 2 variations in optimal parameter values for the default parameterization of pcr globwb the kge value over the 1901 2010 period is 0 374 at cochem and 0 628 at maxau calibrating the model for this same period results in an increase in kge at all calibration locations table 3 this increase in kge is largest at cochem from 0 37 to 0 57 and smallest at maxau from 0 63 to 0 69 although the one calibration outperforms the default scenario continuously the difference in kge values between them varies considerably through time e g between 0 64 and 0 35 at basel for the default model fig 4 a1 a5 the rolling calibration results in a higher or similar kge value compared to the one calibration scenario with the highest maximum increase of 0 13 in basel at borgharen the kge value hardly increases with the rolling calibration scenario compared to one calibration with a maximum increase of 0 01 furthermore the increase in kge value is not constant through time at basel for example the kge difference between one calibration and rolling calibration is lower at the beginning of the 20th century than at the end for the rolling calibration the mean values of the 10 optimal parameter multiplication factors vary over time for all parameters fig 4 b1 f5 generally this variation is larger at the upstream calibration locations basel and maxau than at the downstream locations lobith cochem and borgharen the calibration results are presented as multiplication factors as well as the corresponding actual parameter values between brackets averaged over the modelling domain for the saturated hydraulic conductivity and minimum soil depth fraction the value is also averaged over the different layers explained in section 2 3 the mean optimal multiplication factor of the minimum soil depth fraction decreases slightly over time at basel from 3 0 2 95 to 2 5 2 46 and maxau from 2 9 2 89 to 2 3 2 29 similarly the mean optimal multiplication factor of saturated hydraulic conductivity decreases from 0 22 0 62 mday 1 to 0 07 0 44 mday 1 at basel and 0 23 0 68 mday 1 to 0 01 0 41 mday 1 at maxau also the mean optimal multiplication factor of the groundwater recession coefficient decreases over time at basel but with more variation compared to the minimum soil depth fraction and the saturated hydraulic conductivity in contrast at maxau the mean optimal multiplication factor of the groundwater recession coefficient is varying between 0 23 0 06 day 1 and 0 27 0 02 day 1 without clear increasing or decreasing trends the mean optimal multiplication factor of the degree day factor exhibits the highest variation of all parameters at the upstream locations both at basel and maxau the mean optimal multiplication factor of the degree day factor starts to increase around 1920 and reaches its peak around 1970 after which it decreases again the mean multiplication factor of the degree day factor varies between about 0 6 1 50 mm c 1day 1 and 2 6 6 50 mm c 1day 1 at basel and 0 7 1 75 mm c 1day 1 and 2 6 6 50 mm c 1day 1 at maxau throughout the calibration period the mean optimal multiplication factor of manning s n shows a constant value of approximately 1 7 0 07 m5 6s 1 over the whole period at basel and a steadily decreasing pattern at maxau at the downstream calibration locations lobith cochem and borgharen the parameters vary less through time compared to the upstream locations especially at borgharen the mean optimal multiplication factors are steady and close to the values of one calibration at lobith some small variations can be observed especially for manning s n but no clear patterns over time can be seen the parameter values at cochem are relatively constant except for a sharp decrease in the mean optimal multiplication factor of the saturated hydraulic conductivity and groundwater recession coefficient and an increase in the mean optimal multiplication factor of manning s n around 1990 3 3 effect on hydrograph both at basel and at lobith the flow duration curve resulting from the model calibrated with a rolling calibration is generally closest to the curve resulting from the observed discharged fig 5 digital supplement iii also for the high and low flow segments although this is not the case for the low flow 95 segments at basel where the bias between the default model and the observed discharge is lower than for the rolling calibration and the high flow 5 segment at lobith there the bias of the one calibration scenario is slightly less than for the rolling calibration at a daily timescale fig 6 digital supplement iv the hydrographs predicted with the model based on one calibration and a rolling calibration are very similar for basel in 1930 1931 but further apart in 1980 1981 especially in the spring of 1980 for this period the discharge peaks computed with the model based on a rolling calibration occur earlier and are higher than the peaks computed with the model based on one calibration at lobith the hydrograph predicted with the model based on a rolling calibration is less smooth than hydrograph predicted with the model based on one calibration for both 1930 1931 and 1980 1981 3 4 relations of optimal parameter values with catchment changes the temperature as well as the amount of precipitation has increased over time at both basel and lobith in the past decade fig 7 digital supplement v the relative increase in temperature between 1901 and 2010 is largest at basel from 6 01 c in 1901 1910 to 7 97 c in 2001 2010 the amount of precipitation increased by 3 6 between the 1901 1910 and 2001 2010 at basel the reference potential evapotranspiration increased until it peaked around 1940 then decreased rapidly and started rising again around 1980 caused by an incomplete and limited coverage of observational data in the early 20th century harris et al 2014 at both basel and lobith the upstream average amount of snowfall decreased over time in the past decade the relative abundance of different land use types has changed largely between 1900 and 2010 fig 8 digital supplement vi the fraction of urban area for example increases from 0 006 in 1900 to 0 018 in 2010 at the upstream area of basel and from 0 010 to 0 029 at lobith at the same time the fractions of cropland grazing area decrease especially upstream of lobith a rapid decrease in grazing and pasture area can be observed between 1940 and 1960 the total area of landcover changed by human influences i e the sum of urban area grazing pasture and cropland shows a decrease to about 50 of its original value between 1900 and 2010 the correlations of the mean optimal multiplication values of the parameter found in the rolling calibration with the precipitation fig 9 digital supplement vii are generally low ranging from 0 23 to 0 17 at basel and lobith at basel the temperature shows a higher correlation with the saturated hydraulic conductivity 0 45 and groundwater recession coefficient 0 49 but these correlations are low at lobith the highest correlations can be found between 90 percentile precipitation and the saturated hydraulic conductivity at basel 0 75 but also the other parameters are highly correlated with the potential reference evapotranspiration compared to the other climate variables at lobith the correlations are except for the degree day factor lower in comparison to the correlations at basel the correlations between the fractions of upstream land use and the mean optimal multiplication factor of the parameters are generally higher than for the climate variables especially for basel with an r value ranging up to 0 87 and 0 89 fig 10 digital supplement viii the highest correlations occur for the saturated hydraulic conductivity with the fraction of urban area cropland grazing area and area of total landcover changed by human influences and between the degree day factor and cropland or area of total landcover changed by human influences 4 discussion 4 1 systemic change and its spatial patterns running pcr globwb with its default parameterization for the rhine meuse basin between 1901 and 2010 causes the model performance to be highly variable through time calibrating the model once for the 1901 2010 period increases its overall performance but the temporal variations in kge remain to a large extent similar if the model is calibrated for 10 year rolling periods the kge values increase for some periods at the upstream locations basel maxau the fluctuating model performance cannot be solved by it entirely the largest fluctuations in optimal parameter values at the upstream locations were found for the degree day factor to which the discharge is also most sensitive at the downstream locations lobith cochem and borgharen the parameters are less variable through time resulting in a smaller increase in kge value if a rolling calibration is used the time variant model parameters indicate that the discharge cannot be accurately predicted with a constant model parameterization throughout the 1901 2010 period which is according to the definition of verstegen et al 2016 an indication for the occurrence of systemic change at the upstream parts of the basin the found changes in the optimal value of the degree day factor match the findings of merz et al 2011 who calibrated 273 catchments in austria between 1976 and 2006 although the magnitude of the change in merz et al 2011 is different with a degree day factor ranging between 1 6 and 1 8 mm c 1day 1 for merz et al 2011 and between 1 5 and 6 5 mm c 1day 1 for this study the general pattern is similar to the trends found in this study indicating similar trends for the swiss and austrian alps this can possibly be explained by the fact that snow melt in pcr globwb is largely based on the snow melt module of the hbv model bergström 1995 wada et al 2014 which is also used by merz et al 2011 merz et al 2011 also found however an increase in maximum soil moisture storage which does not agree with the decrease in minimum soil depth fraction and saturated hydraulic conductivity found at the upstream areas in this study 4 2 possible causes of systemic change 4 2 1 climate change the highest correlations with r values higher than 0 5 or lower than 0 5 could be found between the reference potential evapotranspiration and the saturated hydraulic conductivity degree day factor and manning s n between the 90 percentile precipitation and the saturated hydraulic conductivity and between the amount of snowfall and the groundwater recession coefficient these correlations indicate that climate change is a potential cause of changing optimal parameter values however because precipitation temperature and reference evapotranspiration are directly used as input variables of pcr globwb the model should be able to account for changes in processes like snowmelt and infiltration due to climate change this implies that the climate change is an indirect cause of the changes in optimal parameter values for example the decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity and to a lesser extent the minimum soil depth fraction could be explained by an increase in precipitation intensity as indicated by the high negative correlation with the 90 percentile precipitation several studies found an increase in high intensity precipitation events throughout the 20th century as a result of temperature increases both for europe in general klein tank and können 2003 and for the swiss alps scherrer et al 2016 schmidli and frei 2005 this can partly be observed by an increase in 90 percentile precipitation but because pcr globwb uses daily time steps changes in high intensity precipitation on for example an hourly scale are not taken into account the resulting increase in infiltration excess overland flow can therefore not be accurately simulated which is compensated by a decrease in the optimal parameter values for saturated hydraulic conductivity and minimum soil depth fraction the variations in degree day factor can potentially be explained by a too simplistic snow module in pcr globwb snow melt in pcr globwb is simulated using temperature index modelling which is convenient due to its low data requirement and computational simplicity especially compared to the more physically based energy balance models kumar et al 2013 however the degree day factor used for the temperature index model often varies considerably in space and time especially in mountainous areas due to changes in relative contributions of different heat fluxes deng and zhang 2018 jost et al 2007 zhang et al 2006 this could also explain the observed spatial variations in optimal parameter value trends because the use of temperature index modelling may be sufficient for the downstream areas of the rhine meuse basin cochem and borgharen but the mountainous areas in the upstream parts may require a more advanced snow melt module to simulate changes in the relative contributions of different heat fluxes hock 2003 for some cases however a temperature index model is sufficient debele et al 2010 when the temperature index model is calibrated in space as well as time kumar et al 2013 furthermore because snow melt is modelled on a daily scale diurnal variations in temperature are not considered this is important when the temperature is above 0 c for part of the day but the average daily temperature is still below freezing calibrating the model using both discharge and snow cover data may therefore improve the overall model simulations franz and karsten 2013 parajka and blöschl 2008 széles et al 2020 although snow cover data for the first part of the 20th century will be difficult to obtain 4 2 2 land use change contrary to what one might expect the area of forest has increased in the rhine meuse basin mainly caused by reforestation as a reaction to the timber shortage after the second world war fuchs et al 2015 pfister et al 2004 in the meuse catchment this included an increase in coniferous forests ashagrie et al 2006 tu et al 2005 and artificially drained agricultural areas pfister et al 2004 apart from the expansion of irrigated areas land use change is not included in pcr globwb sutanudjaja et al 2018 the changes in the land use types i e urban area cropland rangeland are highly correlated i e r values higher than 0 5 or lower than 0 5 with all parameters except manning s n these high correlations between the changes in land uses and the patterns in optimal parameter values and the fact that land use change is not incorporated in pcr globwb indicate that land use change is a potential cause of systemic change at the upstream sub catchments of the rhine meuse basin even though many studies have been carried out to determine the effects of land use change on the discharge or flood frequency alewell and bebi 2010 ashagrie et al 2006 filoso et al 2017 pfister et al 2004 pinter et al 2006 teuling et al 2019 tu et al 2005 ward et al 2008 these effects are complex and it is difficult to provide general conclusions tu et al 2005 the minimum soil depth fraction hydraulic conductivity and groundwater recession coefficient all show high negative correlations with the amount of urban area and positive correlations with the amount of agricultural area indicating that both urbanization and a decrease in agricultural area are a possible cause of these parameter changes urbanization has been profound in the rhine meuse basin as the amount of urban area has almost tripled upstream of basel over the last century streets and houses decrease the infiltration capacity and the removal of vegetation increases transpiration hurkmans et al 2008 pfister et al 2004 these processes all increase the runoff coefficient which if kept stationary could be compensated by the decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity minimum soil depth fraction and groundwater recession coefficient as found in this study even though only a small fraction about 2 of the upstream area of basel consists of urban area hundecha and bárdossy 2004 found that urbanization in the middle part of the rhine catchment has a large effect on the peak flow especially in summer simultaneously with urbanization reforestation has occurred in the rhine meuse basin which expresses itself in the hyde 3 2 database as a decrease in total human land use many studies report that reforestation generally results in a decreased amount of runoff alewell and bebi 2010 farley et al 2005 filoso et al 2017 van dijk and keenan 2007 caused by a high evapotranspiration and a high infiltration capacity of forests yet this relation between reforestation and streamflow is expected to depend heavily on the type of forest management farley et al 2005 forest age teuling and van dijke 2020 and location filoso et al 2017 the positive correlations between the amount of agricultural area and the minimum soil depth fraction and between the saturated hydraulic conductivity and groundwater recession coefficient suggest an increase in the amount of fast runoff which contradicts with this general idea that an increase in forest cover results in a decreased runoff it could therefore be stated that either reforestation is not a cause of systemic change in the rhine meuse basin or that the link between reforestation and streamflow is indeed not that straightforward 4 2 3 construction of river structures manning s n shows with r values between 0 35 and 0 51 generally low correlations with patterns in both climate variables and land use types compared to the other parameters however some river canalization measures have taken place in the 20th century in this study area trémolieres et al 1998 the straightening and canalization of the river increases the flow velocity and could therefore explain the decrease in the optimal values of manning s n found in for example maxau one could argue that the construction of reservoirs and changes in human water use could also affect the discharge and therefore the optimal parameter values over times however because these phenomena are both included in pcr globwb sutanudjaja et al 2018 they should not result in systemic change unless they are represented too simplistically in addition it is expected that reservoirs have a much more abrupt effect on the river discharge than the changes in optimal model parameters observed in our study it should be noted that the discharge has a relatively low sensitivity to manning s roughness coefficient compared to other parameters especially at basel this could be an explanation for the small changes in the optimal values of manning s n found at basel and the related low correlations to climate variables and land use types 4 3 suggestions for future research even though systemic change is a characteristic of a certain catchment in combination with a specific model verstegen et al 2016 it would be interesting to perform the same assessment with a different model this would show whether the parameter trends found in this study are related to system conceptualizations in pcr globwb or if there is a more general lack in hydrological process understanding in addition this study only detects systemic change and describes its potential direct causes two further lines of research are of interest firstly indirect causes with and without time lags should be studied for example by analysing cross correlations between potential variables of influence secondly on the basis of our current results nothing can be said about the consequences of the observed systemic change on future discharge predictions a next step would therefore be to compare discharge with and without time variant parameters and validate the predictions with measured discharge values this way it can be determined whether systemic change should be considered in future modelling studies or if the differences are neglectable 5 conclusions the aim of this study was to identify systemic change in the rhine meuse basin and its potential causes with pcr globwb 2 0 a global hydrological model this was done by performing a brute force calibration for five parameters between 1901 2010 by calibrating for 10 year rolling calibration periods trends in optimal parameter values through time were determined indicating the occurrence of systemic change this led to the following conclusions the optimal parameter values especially the degree day factor changed notably through time at the upstream calibration locations basel and maxau with values that ranged from 0 5 to 2 5 times its default value at the downstream locations lobith cochem and borgharen the optimal parameter values were more stable than at the upstream locations these changes in optimal parameter values indicate that systemic change has occurred mainly at the upstream subcatchments of the rhine meuse basin especially in the second half of the 20th century the high correlations between the optimal parameter values and meteorological forcing and land use data indicate that the both climate change and land use change mainly urbanization are potential causes of systemic change in the rhine meuse basin canalization of the rhine could explain the observed changes in manning s n this study thus shows that systemic change has indeed occurred during the 1901 2010 period in the rhine meuse basin especially in the more upstream parts this indicates that future climate change studies that use global or large scale hydrological models have to be careful when interpreting the results especially the optimal value of the degree day factor shows high variations through space as well as time when pcr globwb 2 0 is used which might ask for a more regionalized and time variant approach credit authorship contribution statement jessica ruijsch methodology formal analysis software writing

259,in hydrological modelling traditionally one calibration was performed over a certain calibration period before the model is used to study the hydrological system this implies that a constant model structure and parameterization are assumed however if the catchment system is subject to changes that are not incorporated in the model the parameter values found in a calibration period may not be optimal for other periods which is called systemic change the aim of this study was to identify systemic change and its possible causes with the pcr globwb hydrological model in the rhine meuse basin by performing a brute force calibration for multiple periods for five calibration locations between 1901 2010 systemic change was studied for the main model components by selecting a key parameter from each component minimum soil depth fraction saturated hydraulic conductivity groundwater recession coefficient degree day factor manning s n these parameters were calibrated for 10 year rolling periods between 1901 2010 the results showed that at the downstream locations the changes in optimal parameter values were small while at the upstream locations the optimal values of most parameters changed considerably over the different rolling calibration periods signifying systemic change especially the degree day factor showed large variations varying over time between 0 5 and 2 5 times its default value at basel and maxau upstream and middle part of the rhine basin based on correlation analysis it was found that climate change as well as changes in land use and river structure are possible causes of changes in optimal parameter values through time keywords systemic change hydrological modelling parameter stability pcr globwb model rhine meuse basin 1 introduction the amount of damage caused by riverine flooding has increased over the past years due to population growth and economic development in flood prone areas winsemius et al 2016 on top of that anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability may change atmospheric processes and as a consequence the occurrence of riverine floods hall et al 2014 to be able to adapt to the consequences of climate change more knowledge is needed on how hydrological systems respond to changing conditions blöschl et al 2019 hydrological models can help to improve system understanding and to simulate future systems to support decision making however due to a lack of data or process understanding hydrological models need some sort of parameterization to perform well arsenault et al 2018 which is why hydrological models are often calibrated i e finding parameter values that result in the best fit between model output and historic observations of the catchment in hydrological modelling traditionally one calibration with discharge measurements or possibly additional hydrological information e g fernandez palomino et al 2020 ilampooranan et al 2021 melišová et al 2020 is performed over a certain period after which the model is validated with observations of another period split sample test klemeš 1986 pechlivanidis et al 2011 this method implies the modeller assumes that the model equations and parameters are stationary however fundamental changes in behaviour of the modelled system represented by the model equations can occur over time that are not represented by the used model structure or parameterization these changes can therefore not be simulated and may result in model output that deviates from observed values we refer to this problem as systemic change following verstegen et al 2016 the assumption of a stationary system used in split sample testing becomes invalid under systemic changes and can cause large deviations in hydrological forecasts coron et al 2012 merz et al 2011 especially because hydrological models often behave highly nonlinear peel and blöschl 2011 it is therefore increasingly recognized in hydrology that hydrological model equations and parameter values cannot be naively transferred to changing conditions thirel et al 2015 if an hydrological model is calibrated for different periods and the optimal model parameter values vary over these periods this can have several causes merz et al 2011 westra et al 2014 first changes in the catchment may have occurred that are not incorporated in the model processes like climate change peel and blöschl 2011 land use change pathiraja et al 2016 and the construction of hydrological structures like dikes hall et al 2014 can affect the hydrological system and therefore affect the optimal model parameter values in different calibration periods if these processes are not incorporated in the model secondly if the used representation of catchment processes is too simplistic the model may not be able to simulate the discharge under changing conditions wagener et al 2003 in addition model calibration partly compensates for error or bias in input and or observational data so if these error terms are not constant through time performing calibration over different periods may imply different optimal model parameter values beven and binley 1992 westra et al 2014 several studies have been carried out to determine the effect of climate change and land use change on optimal model parameter values merz et al 2011 determined the time stability of optimal parameter values for six 5 year periods between 1976 and 2006 in 273 austrian catchments and found considerable variation in optimal snow and soil moisture parameter values sleziak et al 2018 used three 10 year periods between 1981 and 2010 to determine how hydrological models perform under different climate conditions and found that the optimal model parameter values varied over these periods especially for the parameters related to snow and soil moisture processes pathiraja et al 2016 studied the effect of deforestation on optimal model parameter values and found that the values of parameters related to groundwater and surface routing changed in response to deforestation to account for a decrease in percolation and a faster peak discharge however these studies assessed relatively short time spans e g 30 to 40 years and small study areas 6200 km2 while non stationarity may become more apparent when taking longer periods or larger river basins due to long term or large scale processes peel and blöschl 2011 also existing studies often explore systemic change in a limited set of hydrologic system components while the focus is often on a small set of possible environmental drivers of systemic change the latter is an important limitation as systemic change can be due to a range of possible causes including and not restricted to climate change land use change and basin management thus an analysis studying these changes simultaneously over large time spans in large basins as well as smaller subbasins is needed to determine the possible causes of systemic change and to prevent incorrect conclusions regarding causal relations the aim of this study is therefore to identify systemic change and its possible causes for a large river basin and a long period with pcr globwb 2 0 a global hydrological model sutanudjaja et al 2018 van beek and bierkens 2009 van beek et al 2011 the rhine meuse basin 200 000 km2 was chosen as study area because discharge and meteorological observations are available for more than 100 years this results in the following research questions i provided the pcr globwb 2 0 model has systemic change occurred in the rhine meuse basin in the last century if yes in what parameters when and how abrupt ii what is the variation in systemic change if present between sub basins and iii what is the relation of systemic changes if present with changes in climate land use and river structures this study contributes to the existing literature as follows the long study period 100 years provides the opportunity to detect long term slow systemic changes in the hydrological system allowing for a better understanding of how the hydrological system will change to anthropogenic climate change and land use change in the future this is especially relevant for climate change studies that use global large scale hydrological models in a simplified manner in addition most existing studies have a relatively small study area and the use of the rhine meuse basin 200 000 km2 through which systemic change can be studied at larger scales furthermore the comparison of trends in optimal parameter values between different sub basins within the large rhine meuse basin allows for the assessment of spatial variation in systemic change and the relations between these different sub basins e g upstream vs downstream 2 methods in summary the pcr globwb hydrological model sutanudjaja et al 2018 van beek and bierkens 2009 van beek et al 2011 section 2 2 is run for the rhine meuse basin section 2 1 between 1901 and 2010 to perform a brute force calibration of five parameters sections 2 3 and 2 4 measured discharge data are used to calibrate the model at basel maxau lobith cochem and borgharen representing different parts and tributaries of the rhine meuse basin to be able to identify the temporal stability of the optimal parameter values the model is calibrated in three different ways default model no calibration is performed and pcr globwb is run with its default parameterization one calibration the model is run with 576 different parameter sets to determine the optimal parameter values for 1901 2010 rolling calibration the model is run with 576 different parameter sets to determine the optimal parameter values for each 10 year rolling calibration period i e 1901 1910 1902 1911 1903 1912 2001 2010 this last calibration method results in a time series of 101 optimal parameter value sets which is analysed for trends as an indication for systemic change the trends in optimal parameter values at different locations were then compared to patterns in meteorological forcing data land use data and qualitative data on the construction of river structures to identify possible causes of the systemic changes section 2 5 2 1 study area the rhine meuse basin with a basin area of approximately 185 000 km2 the river rhine is one of the larger rivers in europe it originates in the swiss alps and flows through several countries i a switzerland germany and the netherlands after which it ends in the north sea the discharge at the river mouth is on average about 2300 m3 s of which almost 50 comes from the area upstream of basel schmitt et al 2018 in the most upstream part the discharge largely depends on glacial and snow melt while the more downstream sub catchments have a combined rainfall snowmelt regime the meuse basin has an area of approximately 35 000 km2 and is located in france belgium luxembourg germany and the netherlands de niel et al 2017 the discharge of the meuse is on average about 350 m3 s and the river is mainly fed by rain this results in high winter discharge and very low summer discharge about 25 of winter discharge de wit et al 2007 the study area contains the combined rhine meuse basin but excludes the delta area in the netherlands in this study area the meuse catchment is therefore not a sub catchment of the rhine but a separate catchment the total rhine meuse basin covers approximately 200 000 km2 fig 1 the rhine has always been an important river due to its economic and cultural relevance schmitt et al 2018 but with a notable flood risk that has increased over the past decennia murawski et al 2016 it is expected that the regime will change from a combined rainfall snowmelt regime to a more rainfall dominated regime which is likely to cause an increase in the occurrence of extreme high and low flow hurkmans et al 2009 2 2 model and input data the model used in this study was pcr globwb 2 0 a global hydrological model sutanudjaja et al 2018 van beek and bierkens 2009 van beek et al 2011 this second version of the model is available in a 5 arcminute as well as in a 30 arcminute resolution and simulates the terrestrial water balance on a daily time step although a 5 arcminute resolution would arguably result in a closer representation of the real system a 30 arcminute resolution was chosen for this study to save computation time for the parameters the standard input data and parameterisation of pcr globwb 2 0 as described in sutanudjaja et al 2018 was used this is largely the same as the parameterisation given in van beek and bierkens 2009 for pcr globwb 1 0 the model was run from 1901 to 2010 corresponding to the availability of the discharge measurements used as observational data in the calibration section 2 4 the model consists of 5 modules the meteorological forcing module the land surface module the groundwater module the surface water routing module and the irrigation and water use module in these modules pcr globwb calculates with a daily time step the water storage in two soil layers with a maximum thickness of respectively 0 3 and 1 2 m and the underlaying groundwater layer in addition the exchange between these layers snow storage interception storage and the atmosphere is calculated the meteorological forcing data set of pcr globwb 2 0 consists of monthly precipitation temperature and reference evaporation data from the cru ts 3 2 data set harris et al 2014 from the climate research unit of the university of east anglia because the model uses daily time steps the forcing data was downscaled to daily values with era 20c poli et al 2016 for a more detailed description of the model and its default parameterization refer to sutanudjaja et al 2018 2 3 calibration parameters five model parameters are calibrated the degree day factor f d m c 1day 1 saturated hydraulic conductivity k s 1 k s 2 mday 1 minimum soil depth fraction f groundwater recession coefficient j 1 day 1 and manning s n n m5 6s 1 table 1 these parameters were selected in such a way that each component of the hydrological system is represented which allows an evaluation of the occurrence of systemic changes in these different components for each component the most important parameter was selected based on sutanudjaja et al 2014 and lópez lópez et al 2017 although including more parameters could result in a better fit between modelled and observed discharge it would also result in a rapid increase in computation time needed for the brute force calibration pcr globwb uses a temperature index model to simulate snow melt this means that the degree day factor f d m c 1day 1 is used to model snow melt as 2 1 s c m e l t f d t t m e l t where sc melt is the amount of snow melt m t is the actual temperature c and t melt is the temperature at which snow will melt c wada et al 2014 the degree day factor determines therefore the amount of snow melt per degree day the default value for the degree day factor in pcr globwb is 2 5 mm c 1day 1 sutanudjaja et al 2018 the minimum soil depth fraction f is used in pcr globwb to partition the net liquid water reaching the soil consisting of snowmelt and rainfall into direct runoff overland flow above the soil and infiltration to the soil such partitioning processes are conceptualized based on the distribution of soil saturation in each grid cell and following the improved arno scheme hagemann gates 2003 todini 1996 the fraction of saturated soil in a grid cell x is given by sutanudjaja et al 2014 van beek bierkens 2009 2 2 x 1 w m a x w a c t w m a x w m i n b b 1 where w max m is the total storage capacity of all soil layers w min m is the minimum storage capacity of the soil layer w act m is the actual storage of all soil layers and the exponent parameter b defines the distribution of soil water storage capacities within a cell in pcr globwb w max and w min are related through the minimum soil depth fraction f as 2 3 w m i n w m a x f for grid cells with f 0 and therefore w min 0 direct runoff always occurs for a rainfall event if w min 0 no direct runoff occurs as long as w act does not exceed w min the minimum soil depth fraction depends on the land cover type and location and has therefore different values for tall natural vegetation short natural vegetation non paddy irrigated crops and paddy irrigated crops throughout the basin in the rhine meuse basin the minimum soil depth fraction has a value ranging between 0 11 and 0 88 for tall natural vegetation between 0 00 and 0 50 for short natural vegetation between 0 75 and 0 88 for non paddy irrigated crops and 0 75 for paddy irrigated crops the default values of f for the tall natural vegetation i e forest land cover are shown in fig 2 as an example the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s 1 k s 2 mday 1 of the first and second soil layer were calibrated simultaneously they are used in pcr globwb to respectively simulate the transport from the first soil layer to the second soil layer and from the second soil layer to the groundwater layer the amount of infiltration or capillary rise depends on the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the degree of saturation in the soil layers this means that the saturated hydraulic conductivity determines how much water can infiltrate into the soil and therefore the amount of runoff the values of the standard parameterization of the model were derived from the digital soil map of the world fao 1998 and tabulated data van beek and bierkens 2009 over the rhine meuse basin the saturated hydraulic conductivity varies between 0 14 and 3 14 mday 1 at the first soil layer and 0 10 and 2 36 mday 1 at the second soil layer fig 2 the groundwater recession coefficient j 1 day 1 is used in the groundwater module to quantify the linear relation between groundwater storage and outflow sutanudjaja et al 2018 the default value of the groundwater recession coefficient depends on aquifer and flow network properties and is computed with the drainage theory of kraijenhoff van de leur 1958 and lithological maps dürr et al 2005 the default value of the groundwater recession coefficient varies between 0 003 and 0 054 day 1 fig 2 manning s n n m5 6s 1 is a roughness coefficient to simulate the kinematic wave routing in pcr globwb the kinematic wave is an approximation of the saint venant equations where the flow is described by the manning s equation the default value of manning s n is set to 0 04 m5 6s 1 for the entire area which is a commonly assumed value for natural rivers chow 1959 2 4 calibration and sensitivity analysis the model was calibrated using a brute force calibration technique meaning that the model was run for all possible parameter combinations given a certain step size table 2 for the 1901 2010 period since the minimum soil depth fraction the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the groundwater recession coefficient are spatially variable the calibration is performed by multiplying the parameter value in each cell with a multiplication factor to retain the spatial pattern of the parameters the step size for the multiplication factors follows a linear constant step size scale with multiplication factors of 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 except for the saturated hydraulic conductivity and groundwater recession coefficient which follow a logarithmic scale because these parameters vary naturally over multiple orders of magnitude table 2 this means that these parameters vary with 10a where a is the multiplication factor given in table 2 the multiplication factors for these parameters is 0 5 0 0 and 0 5 combining all these parameter sets results in a total of 576 parameter value combinations that are used for calibration to gain more insight into the effect of variation in the parameter values on the hydrograph a sensitivity analysis was carried out for each of the selected parameters minimum soil depth fraction saturated hydraulic conductivity groundwater recession coefficient degree day factor and manning s roughness coefficient hereto we applied a one at a time sensitivity analysis by running the model for different values for each parameter table 2 while the other parameters are set to their default values for these parameter combinations the mean yearly average the mean yearly standard deviation and the mean yearly 95 and 5 percentile of the discharge were calculated in addition the resulting hydrographs were plotted for a single year 1930 to show how sensitive the discharge is to the changing parameters which is important information when interpreting the parameter trends through time the sensitivity analysis was performed for basel representing the upstream areas of the basin and lobith representing the downstream areas to compare the effect of the parameters on the discharge at different subcatchments of the study area to determine the optimal parameter value combinations of the brute force calibration simulated discharge values were compared to observed discharge values from the global runoff data centre grdc http www bafg de grdc at basel rhine maxau rhine lobith rhine cochem moselle and borgharen meuse the objective function used to determine the optimal parameter values was the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 which is a decomposition of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and measures correlation variability and bias to determine the overall model s skill the kge was chosen instead of the often used nse because the nse tends to underestimate runoff peaks due to an underestimation of the discharge variability gupta et al 2009 in this study three calibration scenarios were compared the first scenario is no calibration at all which means the discharge is modelled with the default parameterization of pcr globwb which we called the default model next the model was calibrated once for the entire 1901 2010 period by choosing the parameter value combination with the highest kge for this whole period referred to as one calibration in addition to determine how the optimal parameter values vary over time the model was calibrated for consecutive 10 year rolling periods 10 year periods were used instead of one year periods because some processes like groundwater respond over larger time scales by considering at 10 year periods the calibration period is larger than the residence time of the groundwater this means that the optimal parameter combination was determined with the objective function evaluated for 1901 1910 1902 1911 1903 1912 or 2000 2010 lavenne et al 2016 which we call the rolling calibration this resulted in 101 optimal parameter value sets one for each period represented by its central year 2 5 identifying systemic change and its causes next the optimal parameter values of the one calibration and rolling calibration were compared to the default model optimal parameter values are the parameter values forming the ensemble of the 10 highest kge values for each calibration period this ensemble was used instead of the single optimal parameter value because one optimal parameter is still for a large part subject to randomness especially when the kge values are close together the mean and standard deviation of the parameter values in this ensemble were plotted for each 10 year rolling calibration period after which they were visually inspected to detect parameter trends through time potential variations in optimal parameter values through time are an indication of systemic change this method was repeated for all five calibration locations basel maxau lobith cochem and borgharen and the parameter trends were compared for these locations to determine the spatial variation of systemic change in the rhine meuse basin however because the saturated hydraulic conductivity minimum soil depth fraction and groundwater recession coefficient are spatially variable the multiplication factors were used for further calculations in the next steps instead of the actual optimal parameter values even though the parameters of the default model and one calibration scenarios do not change through time their kge values were calculated for each 10 year rolling calibration period this enables a comparison of the performances of the default model one calibration and the rolling calibration scenarios for each 10 year rolling calibration period to evaluate the model performance flow duration curves i e plot of exceedance probability vs discharge were plotted for the different calibration scenarios following yilmaz et al 2008 and pfannerstill et al 2014 the mean discharge of the 5 and 95 percentile segments and their bias with the measured discharge was computed for these calibration scenarios in addition hydrographs were plotted for the observed discharge the default model one calibration and rolling calibration in order to compare the model performance on different aspects of the hydrograph for the rolling calibration a discharge series is created by combining the years in the middle of the rolling calibration periods e g 1905 from 1901 1910 and 1906 from 1902 1911 because the middle years represent the surrounding rolling calibration period best to reduce the number of figures plots are shown only for basel and lobith respectively representing the upstream and the combined downstream and upstream part of the basin figures for the other locations are presented in the digital supplement to determine potential causes of systemic change the optimal parameter value trends are compared to trends in meteorological forcing data from the cru ts 3 2 data set harris et al 2014 and land use change from the hyde 3 2 data set klein goldewijk et al 2011 in addition to the standard meteorological forcing data from pcr globwb temperature precipitation and reference potential evapotranspiration also the amount of snowfall defined as the amount of precipitation that falls when the temperature is below 0 c and the 90 percentile precipitation were calculated to give more insight into the changing precipitation patterns isotta et al 2014 these values were averaged over the upstream area of each calibration location and over each calibration period to be able to match them to the optimal parameter values furthermore the optimal parameter value trends are compared to trends in land use areas from hyde the hyde 3 2 database contains the area of cropland grazing and urban area and an uncertainty range for each 5 arcminute grid cell at 10 year intervals between 1900 and 2010 i e 1900 1910 1920 etc to be able to compare the land use types for the different calibration locations the total area of vegetation cover per grid cell was converted to a fraction by dividing the value by the total cell area in addition the dataset was upscaled to a 30 arcminute resolution for the rhine meuse basin with a nearest neighbour interpolation as with the meteorological data the upstream average value was calculated for each calibration location the trends in climate variables and land use were compared to the trends in optimal parameter values by creating scatter plots for the different calibration locations the correlation coefficient r was calculated for each parameter climate variable land use type combination to indicate the correlation between these factors again only the figures for basel and lobith are shown the other locations are included in the digital supplement 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis changing parameter values affect the hydrograph in different ways at different locations fig 3 digital supplement i the minimum soil depth fraction groundwater recession coefficient and manning s n all have a similarly small effect on the hydrograph at basel but at lobith the differences in discharge between the parameter multiplication factors are larger a decrease in the multiplication factor of manning s n causes for example a delay in the modelled peak discharge at lobith the saturated hydraulic conductivity and degree day factor have a large effect on the hydrograph compared to the other parameters as can be expected a decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity results in a peakier discharge at both basel and lobith the effect of changing the degree day factor is most visible during spring and early summer as a decrease in degree day factor causes a later peak discharge in spring the one at a time sensitivity analysis shows that the saturated hydraulic conductivity has a relatively large effect on the mean and extreme discharge values at all locations compared to the other parameters digital supplement ii in addition the minimum soil depth fraction has a larger effect on the mean than on the extreme discharges the degree day factor is more sensitive at the upstream locations basel maxau than at the downstream locations cochem borgharen fig 3 sensitivity analysis of the calibration parameters on the hydrograph for the year 1930 at basel left and lobith right the different rows show different parameters where the multiplication factors colours of that parameter change while the other parameters remain constant for the sensitivity analysis at the other locations refer to digital supplement i 3 2 variations in optimal parameter values for the default parameterization of pcr globwb the kge value over the 1901 2010 period is 0 374 at cochem and 0 628 at maxau calibrating the model for this same period results in an increase in kge at all calibration locations table 3 this increase in kge is largest at cochem from 0 37 to 0 57 and smallest at maxau from 0 63 to 0 69 although the one calibration outperforms the default scenario continuously the difference in kge values between them varies considerably through time e g between 0 64 and 0 35 at basel for the default model fig 4 a1 a5 the rolling calibration results in a higher or similar kge value compared to the one calibration scenario with the highest maximum increase of 0 13 in basel at borgharen the kge value hardly increases with the rolling calibration scenario compared to one calibration with a maximum increase of 0 01 furthermore the increase in kge value is not constant through time at basel for example the kge difference between one calibration and rolling calibration is lower at the beginning of the 20th century than at the end for the rolling calibration the mean values of the 10 optimal parameter multiplication factors vary over time for all parameters fig 4 b1 f5 generally this variation is larger at the upstream calibration locations basel and maxau than at the downstream locations lobith cochem and borgharen the calibration results are presented as multiplication factors as well as the corresponding actual parameter values between brackets averaged over the modelling domain for the saturated hydraulic conductivity and minimum soil depth fraction the value is also averaged over the different layers explained in section 2 3 the mean optimal multiplication factor of the minimum soil depth fraction decreases slightly over time at basel from 3 0 2 95 to 2 5 2 46 and maxau from 2 9 2 89 to 2 3 2 29 similarly the mean optimal multiplication factor of saturated hydraulic conductivity decreases from 0 22 0 62 mday 1 to 0 07 0 44 mday 1 at basel and 0 23 0 68 mday 1 to 0 01 0 41 mday 1 at maxau also the mean optimal multiplication factor of the groundwater recession coefficient decreases over time at basel but with more variation compared to the minimum soil depth fraction and the saturated hydraulic conductivity in contrast at maxau the mean optimal multiplication factor of the groundwater recession coefficient is varying between 0 23 0 06 day 1 and 0 27 0 02 day 1 without clear increasing or decreasing trends the mean optimal multiplication factor of the degree day factor exhibits the highest variation of all parameters at the upstream locations both at basel and maxau the mean optimal multiplication factor of the degree day factor starts to increase around 1920 and reaches its peak around 1970 after which it decreases again the mean multiplication factor of the degree day factor varies between about 0 6 1 50 mm c 1day 1 and 2 6 6 50 mm c 1day 1 at basel and 0 7 1 75 mm c 1day 1 and 2 6 6 50 mm c 1day 1 at maxau throughout the calibration period the mean optimal multiplication factor of manning s n shows a constant value of approximately 1 7 0 07 m5 6s 1 over the whole period at basel and a steadily decreasing pattern at maxau at the downstream calibration locations lobith cochem and borgharen the parameters vary less through time compared to the upstream locations especially at borgharen the mean optimal multiplication factors are steady and close to the values of one calibration at lobith some small variations can be observed especially for manning s n but no clear patterns over time can be seen the parameter values at cochem are relatively constant except for a sharp decrease in the mean optimal multiplication factor of the saturated hydraulic conductivity and groundwater recession coefficient and an increase in the mean optimal multiplication factor of manning s n around 1990 3 3 effect on hydrograph both at basel and at lobith the flow duration curve resulting from the model calibrated with a rolling calibration is generally closest to the curve resulting from the observed discharged fig 5 digital supplement iii also for the high and low flow segments although this is not the case for the low flow 95 segments at basel where the bias between the default model and the observed discharge is lower than for the rolling calibration and the high flow 5 segment at lobith there the bias of the one calibration scenario is slightly less than for the rolling calibration at a daily timescale fig 6 digital supplement iv the hydrographs predicted with the model based on one calibration and a rolling calibration are very similar for basel in 1930 1931 but further apart in 1980 1981 especially in the spring of 1980 for this period the discharge peaks computed with the model based on a rolling calibration occur earlier and are higher than the peaks computed with the model based on one calibration at lobith the hydrograph predicted with the model based on a rolling calibration is less smooth than hydrograph predicted with the model based on one calibration for both 1930 1931 and 1980 1981 3 4 relations of optimal parameter values with catchment changes the temperature as well as the amount of precipitation has increased over time at both basel and lobith in the past decade fig 7 digital supplement v the relative increase in temperature between 1901 and 2010 is largest at basel from 6 01 c in 1901 1910 to 7 97 c in 2001 2010 the amount of precipitation increased by 3 6 between the 1901 1910 and 2001 2010 at basel the reference potential evapotranspiration increased until it peaked around 1940 then decreased rapidly and started rising again around 1980 caused by an incomplete and limited coverage of observational data in the early 20th century harris et al 2014 at both basel and lobith the upstream average amount of snowfall decreased over time in the past decade the relative abundance of different land use types has changed largely between 1900 and 2010 fig 8 digital supplement vi the fraction of urban area for example increases from 0 006 in 1900 to 0 018 in 2010 at the upstream area of basel and from 0 010 to 0 029 at lobith at the same time the fractions of cropland grazing area decrease especially upstream of lobith a rapid decrease in grazing and pasture area can be observed between 1940 and 1960 the total area of landcover changed by human influences i e the sum of urban area grazing pasture and cropland shows a decrease to about 50 of its original value between 1900 and 2010 the correlations of the mean optimal multiplication values of the parameter found in the rolling calibration with the precipitation fig 9 digital supplement vii are generally low ranging from 0 23 to 0 17 at basel and lobith at basel the temperature shows a higher correlation with the saturated hydraulic conductivity 0 45 and groundwater recession coefficient 0 49 but these correlations are low at lobith the highest correlations can be found between 90 percentile precipitation and the saturated hydraulic conductivity at basel 0 75 but also the other parameters are highly correlated with the potential reference evapotranspiration compared to the other climate variables at lobith the correlations are except for the degree day factor lower in comparison to the correlations at basel the correlations between the fractions of upstream land use and the mean optimal multiplication factor of the parameters are generally higher than for the climate variables especially for basel with an r value ranging up to 0 87 and 0 89 fig 10 digital supplement viii the highest correlations occur for the saturated hydraulic conductivity with the fraction of urban area cropland grazing area and area of total landcover changed by human influences and between the degree day factor and cropland or area of total landcover changed by human influences 4 discussion 4 1 systemic change and its spatial patterns running pcr globwb with its default parameterization for the rhine meuse basin between 1901 and 2010 causes the model performance to be highly variable through time calibrating the model once for the 1901 2010 period increases its overall performance but the temporal variations in kge remain to a large extent similar if the model is calibrated for 10 year rolling periods the kge values increase for some periods at the upstream locations basel maxau the fluctuating model performance cannot be solved by it entirely the largest fluctuations in optimal parameter values at the upstream locations were found for the degree day factor to which the discharge is also most sensitive at the downstream locations lobith cochem and borgharen the parameters are less variable through time resulting in a smaller increase in kge value if a rolling calibration is used the time variant model parameters indicate that the discharge cannot be accurately predicted with a constant model parameterization throughout the 1901 2010 period which is according to the definition of verstegen et al 2016 an indication for the occurrence of systemic change at the upstream parts of the basin the found changes in the optimal value of the degree day factor match the findings of merz et al 2011 who calibrated 273 catchments in austria between 1976 and 2006 although the magnitude of the change in merz et al 2011 is different with a degree day factor ranging between 1 6 and 1 8 mm c 1day 1 for merz et al 2011 and between 1 5 and 6 5 mm c 1day 1 for this study the general pattern is similar to the trends found in this study indicating similar trends for the swiss and austrian alps this can possibly be explained by the fact that snow melt in pcr globwb is largely based on the snow melt module of the hbv model bergström 1995 wada et al 2014 which is also used by merz et al 2011 merz et al 2011 also found however an increase in maximum soil moisture storage which does not agree with the decrease in minimum soil depth fraction and saturated hydraulic conductivity found at the upstream areas in this study 4 2 possible causes of systemic change 4 2 1 climate change the highest correlations with r values higher than 0 5 or lower than 0 5 could be found between the reference potential evapotranspiration and the saturated hydraulic conductivity degree day factor and manning s n between the 90 percentile precipitation and the saturated hydraulic conductivity and between the amount of snowfall and the groundwater recession coefficient these correlations indicate that climate change is a potential cause of changing optimal parameter values however because precipitation temperature and reference evapotranspiration are directly used as input variables of pcr globwb the model should be able to account for changes in processes like snowmelt and infiltration due to climate change this implies that the climate change is an indirect cause of the changes in optimal parameter values for example the decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity and to a lesser extent the minimum soil depth fraction could be explained by an increase in precipitation intensity as indicated by the high negative correlation with the 90 percentile precipitation several studies found an increase in high intensity precipitation events throughout the 20th century as a result of temperature increases both for europe in general klein tank and können 2003 and for the swiss alps scherrer et al 2016 schmidli and frei 2005 this can partly be observed by an increase in 90 percentile precipitation but because pcr globwb uses daily time steps changes in high intensity precipitation on for example an hourly scale are not taken into account the resulting increase in infiltration excess overland flow can therefore not be accurately simulated which is compensated by a decrease in the optimal parameter values for saturated hydraulic conductivity and minimum soil depth fraction the variations in degree day factor can potentially be explained by a too simplistic snow module in pcr globwb snow melt in pcr globwb is simulated using temperature index modelling which is convenient due to its low data requirement and computational simplicity especially compared to the more physically based energy balance models kumar et al 2013 however the degree day factor used for the temperature index model often varies considerably in space and time especially in mountainous areas due to changes in relative contributions of different heat fluxes deng and zhang 2018 jost et al 2007 zhang et al 2006 this could also explain the observed spatial variations in optimal parameter value trends because the use of temperature index modelling may be sufficient for the downstream areas of the rhine meuse basin cochem and borgharen but the mountainous areas in the upstream parts may require a more advanced snow melt module to simulate changes in the relative contributions of different heat fluxes hock 2003 for some cases however a temperature index model is sufficient debele et al 2010 when the temperature index model is calibrated in space as well as time kumar et al 2013 furthermore because snow melt is modelled on a daily scale diurnal variations in temperature are not considered this is important when the temperature is above 0 c for part of the day but the average daily temperature is still below freezing calibrating the model using both discharge and snow cover data may therefore improve the overall model simulations franz and karsten 2013 parajka and blöschl 2008 széles et al 2020 although snow cover data for the first part of the 20th century will be difficult to obtain 4 2 2 land use change contrary to what one might expect the area of forest has increased in the rhine meuse basin mainly caused by reforestation as a reaction to the timber shortage after the second world war fuchs et al 2015 pfister et al 2004 in the meuse catchment this included an increase in coniferous forests ashagrie et al 2006 tu et al 2005 and artificially drained agricultural areas pfister et al 2004 apart from the expansion of irrigated areas land use change is not included in pcr globwb sutanudjaja et al 2018 the changes in the land use types i e urban area cropland rangeland are highly correlated i e r values higher than 0 5 or lower than 0 5 with all parameters except manning s n these high correlations between the changes in land uses and the patterns in optimal parameter values and the fact that land use change is not incorporated in pcr globwb indicate that land use change is a potential cause of systemic change at the upstream sub catchments of the rhine meuse basin even though many studies have been carried out to determine the effects of land use change on the discharge or flood frequency alewell and bebi 2010 ashagrie et al 2006 filoso et al 2017 pfister et al 2004 pinter et al 2006 teuling et al 2019 tu et al 2005 ward et al 2008 these effects are complex and it is difficult to provide general conclusions tu et al 2005 the minimum soil depth fraction hydraulic conductivity and groundwater recession coefficient all show high negative correlations with the amount of urban area and positive correlations with the amount of agricultural area indicating that both urbanization and a decrease in agricultural area are a possible cause of these parameter changes urbanization has been profound in the rhine meuse basin as the amount of urban area has almost tripled upstream of basel over the last century streets and houses decrease the infiltration capacity and the removal of vegetation increases transpiration hurkmans et al 2008 pfister et al 2004 these processes all increase the runoff coefficient which if kept stationary could be compensated by the decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity minimum soil depth fraction and groundwater recession coefficient as found in this study even though only a small fraction about 2 of the upstream area of basel consists of urban area hundecha and bárdossy 2004 found that urbanization in the middle part of the rhine catchment has a large effect on the peak flow especially in summer simultaneously with urbanization reforestation has occurred in the rhine meuse basin which expresses itself in the hyde 3 2 database as a decrease in total human land use many studies report that reforestation generally results in a decreased amount of runoff alewell and bebi 2010 farley et al 2005 filoso et al 2017 van dijk and keenan 2007 caused by a high evapotranspiration and a high infiltration capacity of forests yet this relation between reforestation and streamflow is expected to depend heavily on the type of forest management farley et al 2005 forest age teuling and van dijke 2020 and location filoso et al 2017 the positive correlations between the amount of agricultural area and the minimum soil depth fraction and between the saturated hydraulic conductivity and groundwater recession coefficient suggest an increase in the amount of fast runoff which contradicts with this general idea that an increase in forest cover results in a decreased runoff it could therefore be stated that either reforestation is not a cause of systemic change in the rhine meuse basin or that the link between reforestation and streamflow is indeed not that straightforward 4 2 3 construction of river structures manning s n shows with r values between 0 35 and 0 51 generally low correlations with patterns in both climate variables and land use types compared to the other parameters however some river canalization measures have taken place in the 20th century in this study area trémolieres et al 1998 the straightening and canalization of the river increases the flow velocity and could therefore explain the decrease in the optimal values of manning s n found in for example maxau one could argue that the construction of reservoirs and changes in human water use could also affect the discharge and therefore the optimal parameter values over times however because these phenomena are both included in pcr globwb sutanudjaja et al 2018 they should not result in systemic change unless they are represented too simplistically in addition it is expected that reservoirs have a much more abrupt effect on the river discharge than the changes in optimal model parameters observed in our study it should be noted that the discharge has a relatively low sensitivity to manning s roughness coefficient compared to other parameters especially at basel this could be an explanation for the small changes in the optimal values of manning s n found at basel and the related low correlations to climate variables and land use types 4 3 suggestions for future research even though systemic change is a characteristic of a certain catchment in combination with a specific model verstegen et al 2016 it would be interesting to perform the same assessment with a different model this would show whether the parameter trends found in this study are related to system conceptualizations in pcr globwb or if there is a more general lack in hydrological process understanding in addition this study only detects systemic change and describes its potential direct causes two further lines of research are of interest firstly indirect causes with and without time lags should be studied for example by analysing cross correlations between potential variables of influence secondly on the basis of our current results nothing can be said about the consequences of the observed systemic change on future discharge predictions a next step would therefore be to compare discharge with and without time variant parameters and validate the predictions with measured discharge values this way it can be determined whether systemic change should be considered in future modelling studies or if the differences are neglectable 5 conclusions the aim of this study was to identify systemic change in the rhine meuse basin and its potential causes with pcr globwb 2 0 a global hydrological model this was done by performing a brute force calibration for five parameters between 1901 2010 by calibrating for 10 year rolling calibration periods trends in optimal parameter values through time were determined indicating the occurrence of systemic change this led to the following conclusions the optimal parameter values especially the degree day factor changed notably through time at the upstream calibration locations basel and maxau with values that ranged from 0 5 to 2 5 times its default value at the downstream locations lobith cochem and borgharen the optimal parameter values were more stable than at the upstream locations these changes in optimal parameter values indicate that systemic change has occurred mainly at the upstream subcatchments of the rhine meuse basin especially in the second half of the 20th century the high correlations between the optimal parameter values and meteorological forcing and land use data indicate that the both climate change and land use change mainly urbanization are potential causes of systemic change in the rhine meuse basin canalization of the rhine could explain the observed changes in manning s n this study thus shows that systemic change has indeed occurred during the 1901 2010 period in the rhine meuse basin especially in the more upstream parts this indicates that future climate change studies that use global or large scale hydrological models have to be careful when interpreting the results especially the optimal value of the degree day factor shows high variations through space as well as time when pcr globwb 2 0 is used which might ask for a more regionalized and time variant approach credit authorship contribution statement jessica ruijsch methodology formal analysis software writing
