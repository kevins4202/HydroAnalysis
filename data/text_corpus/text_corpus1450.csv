7250,clean water is crucial for sustainable economic and social development however around the world low water use efficiency and increasing water pollution have become serious problems to comprehensively evaluate water use and wastewater treatment this paper integrated bi level programming blp and data envelopment analysis dea with a feedback variable to deal with poor output to rank dmus using a super efficiency dea the proposed model was applied to a case study of 10 cities in the minjiang river basin to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness from which it was found that a water system can only be cost efficient when both the water use and wastewater treatment subsystems are both cost efficient the comparison analysis demonstrated that the proposed model was more discriminating and stable than traditional dea models and was able to better improve total water system cost efficiencies than a blp dea model keywords bi level programming data envelopment analysis cost efficiency water use wastewater treatment 1 introduction water is essential for all social and economic activities pedro monzon s et al 2015 hanasaki et al 2013 growing populations and rapid economic development have resulted in adverse environmental impacts water scarcity and serious water pollution han et al 2016 kummu et al 2010 further in many cases water is either wasted or water use efficiency is extremely low all of which aggravates the possibility of a serious water crisis fortunately it has been realized that total water system efficiency involves both water use and also wastewater treatment therefore the evaluation of water use and wastewater treatment efficiencies has become an urgent research focus over the past few decades water use efficiency has gained increasing attention wen et al 2014 developed an optimization model for the large scale use of surface and ground water resources and singh 2016 developed formulas and applications for two optimization models to maximize the net farming revenue of an irrigated area in northwest india by optimally allocating available water and land resources however to accurately judge the multiple inputs and outputs dea models have been proven to be a much more useful way to evaluate the relative performance of a set of production processes or decision making units dmus as they do not require exact production functions charnes et al 1978 for example romano and guerrini 2011 used a dea model to compare 43 water utility companies in italy and gao et al 2013 developed a water use efficiency evaluation model based on a projection pursuit and screened the indexes using an analytic hierarchy process although these methods can also be used to evaluate water use efficiency they only account for the initial inputs and final outputs without considering the relationships between the subsystems or the intermediate outputs such as wastewater or reused water therefore to factor in such dmus and recognize the interlinked levels using multi level stackelberg relationships this paper develops a new approach to describe the structure that considers the internal operations of the water system because of the importance of environmental protection and sustainable development wastewater reuse has been recognized as a viable solution to global water scarcity garcia and pargament 2015 technologies have been developed for wastewater reuse such as oxidants biological treatment physical separation and electrochemical treatments norton brandao et al 2013 to evaluate the efficiency of wastewater treatments yang et al 2015 measured china s environmental efficiency using an environmental super efficiency dea model in 30 chinese provinces from 2000 to 2010 and wu et al 2018 used an input oriented non radical dea model to examine the construction efficiencies in urban sewers and wastewater treatments in 70 chinese megacities from 2006 to 2012 however most studies have only considered ideal outputs such as economic benefits and have ignored the undesirable outputs such as discharged wastewater that are generated at the same time as the desirable outputs which has directly affected the efficiency measures of the dmus to improve efficiency therefore the desirable outputs must increase at the same time that the undesirable outputs decrease further in many studies the wastewater treatment subsystems have been considered separately however if these two subsystems are separately considered the performance of the complete water resource system may be biased therefore these methods may be unsuitable for evaluating complete system efficiency using a recovery network structure in recent years while some research has examined undesirable output again it has not integrated water use with wastewater treatment for example deng et al 2016 proposed a slacks based measurement dea sbm dea model to evaluate water use efficiency in 31 chinese provinces from 2004 to 2013 zhou et al 2017 proposed a type 2 fuzzy bi objective two stage sbm dea model to evaluate the performance of an integrated two stage system morteza et al 2016 used a blp dea model that examined the internal structure using stackelberg game relationships to evaluate the performance of a banking chain and zhou et al 2017 developed a novel blp dea model with multiple followers to evaluate the performance of a bi level system that included two kinds of players to examine the undesirable outputs associated with water use and wastewater treatment bian et al 2014 measured the efficiency of water resource systems in china using a two stage dea approach and zhou et al 2018 assessed the performance of an integrated wuwt system using a mixed network two stage sbm dea model therefore different kinds of dea models have been developed to measure the dmus and have already attained some viable results however there has been no successful attempt to solve and rank dmus for the reused water from the wastewater treatment subsystem to achieve cost efficiency therefore this paper develops an integrated bi level programming dea model with a feedback variable blp deawf to evaluate the cost efficiencies of water use and wastewater treatment this paper makes the following major contributions to current literature 1 the proposed model includes the internal system structure and interactions to provide decision makers with specific comprehensive information about the overall system 2 in the overall water system the water use and wastewater treatment subsystems are proven to have a mutual effect because of the intermediate wastewater and reused water between the subsystems 3 the proposed model deals with undesirable output and therefore assesses the issues associated with sustainable development and has greater environmental benefits 4 to ensure a wider range of values to allow all dmus to be ranked super efficiency is used to resolve the problems associated with multiple dmus having the same efficiency value the developed blp deawf model is proven to be more reliable and to provide a more comprehensive performance evaluation the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 states the problem and gives the fundamental knowledge for the model section 3 develops the model and provides the definitions propositions of the model section 4 discusses the solution method for the model section 5 presents a case study to evaluate the efficiency of regional water and a comparison analysis is given to demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the developed model and conclusions are presented in section 6 2 problem statement to develop the blp deawf method this section presents the cost efficiency of water use and wastewater treatment subsystem and the evaluation of the complete water system a single water resource system can be divided into a water use subsystem and a wastewater treatment subsystem bian et al 2014 the performance of each subsystem can be separately evaluated as the two subsystems have individual objectives and decision variables however they also have mutual influences and restrictions the water use subsystem can be considered the upper level the leader which utilizes several inputs such as fresh water capital investment and reused water to produce the desirable gdp output and also has undesirable discharge wastewater outputs the goal of the upper level is to minimize the total costs of the water system by using the least inputs for the given outputs the wastewater treatment subsystem can be considered the lower level the follower the goal of which is to minimize the subsystem costs by minimizing discharged wastewater wastewater treatment costs and investment capital the capital invested in the two subsystems should be less than a given value because of the need to minimize costs and restrict inputs however while the capital invested in the wastewater treatment subsystem is decided by the follower it is based on the leader s decisions therefore the leader s decisions and the follower s decisions have a mutual influence the lower level system makes decisions based on the leader s decisions and the upper level makes decisions based on full information from the lower level therefore the lower level needs to be embedded into the upper decision making to ensure full consideration is given to the decision makers on the two levels a bi level model has the ability to expose the inner structure of the bi level system and reveal the interactions between the two levels thereby considering the reused water which is the output of the wastewater treatment subsystem and the input for the water use subsystem the blp deawf decision framework is shown in fig 1 3 modeling the performance of the two subsystems needs to be evaluated so that the natural structures or characteristics of the system are fully considered therefore this model must be able to consider the different objectives on both levels at the same time as part of the complete decision framework 3 1 notations to clearly present the modeling process in the following notations the

uses its direct inputs which are shared between the two levels to produce intermediate outputs and direct outputs as cost efficiency is being used to evaluate the efficiency of each dmu minimizing total costs is the goal of the upper level based on the proposed cost efficiency dea model sarrico 2001 the total costs are determined by multiplying the input unit costs made up of the direct freshwater input x 1 d the wastewater treatment costs x 2 d the shared input capital x 1 s x 2 s the intermediate input of discharged wastewater y 1 m and the feedback input reused water y 2 f the unit cost for the fresh water is c 1 d and the unit cost of the wastewater treatment is c 2 d therefore the direct input costs are c 1 d x 1 d c 2 d x 2 d the unit costs associated with the shared inputs are c 1 s and c 2 s respectively and the shared input costs are c 1 s x 1 s c 2 s x 2 s the two unit costs for the discharged wastewater is c 2 m therefore the intermediate input costs are c 2 m y 1 m the unit 1 costs for the reused water are c f and the feedback input costs are c f y 2 f put together the total costs are minimized as 1 min c leader c 1 d x 1 d c 2 d x 2 d c 1 s x 1 s c 2 s

the linear combinations for j dmus feedback input is j 1 j y 2 j f λ j with the linear combination of the feedback input to all dmus being less than or equal to the feedback input for the dmuj then the constraints are as shown below 2 j 1 j x 1 j s λ j x 1 s j 1 j x 1 j d λ j x 1 d j 1 j y 2 j f λ j y 2 f 2 output constraints as y 1 j d is the upper level s direct gdp output in dmuj the linear

upper level s intermediate output discharge wastewater from dmuj the linear combinations for j dmus intermediate output are j 1 j y 1 j m λ j with the linear combinations for the intermediate output to all dmus being equal to or greater than the direct input to the dmuj then the output constraints are as follows 3 j 1 j y 1 j d λ j y 1 d j 1 j y 1 j m λ j y 1 m 3 shared resources constraint as the shared inputs on the two levels are limited the total shared inputs between the two levels should be less than a fixed constant g due to resource limits 4 x 1 s x 2 s g 3 4 lower level goal when the leader minimizes the total costs the follower consumes the direct input wastewater treatment cost x 2 d the shared input between the two levels x 2 s and the intermediate input y 1 m from the leader to produce the final chemical organic output y 2 c and ammonia nitrogen y 2 n as the wastewater treatment unit costs are c 2 d the direct input cost is c 2 d x 2 d the shared input unit cost for the wastewater treatment subsystem is c 2 s and the shared input cost is c 2 s x 2 s the discharged wastewater unit costs are c 2 m and the intermediate input costs are c 2 m y 1 m therefore the total costs for the follower are minimized as follows 5 min c follower c 2 s x 2 s c 2 d x 2 d c 2 m y 1 m 3 5 lower level limitations 1 input constraints similar to the upper level subsystem x 2 j s is the shared input to the wastewater treatment subsystem in dmuj and the linear combinations for the j dmus shared input are j 1 j x 2 j s π j x 2 j d is the shared capital investment input to the

input of the dmuj y 1 j m is the wastewater treatment subsystem intermediate discharged wastewater input in dmuj and the linear combinations for the j dmus intermediate input are j 1 j y 1 j m π j which should less than or equal to the intermediate input for dmuj then the input constraints are as follows 6 j 1 j x 2 j s π j x 2 s j 1 j x 2 j d π j x 2 d j 1 j y 1 j m π j y 1 m 2 output

output in dmuj and the linear combination for the j dmus feedback output is j 1 j y 2 j f π j with the linear combinations for the feedback output to all dmus being equal to or greater than the direct

proposition 2 reveals that the water system is cost efficient if and only if water use subsystem and wastewater treatment subsystem are both cost efficient 4 solution method the solution method for the proposed model is divided into three steps 1 transform model 8 into a standard linear blp model 2 transform the standard blp model into a single level model and 3 use existing branch and bound algorithms to solve the standard linear blp shi et al 2005 the step by step transformation of the model is shown in the following let x x 1 s x 1 d y 2 f λ t y x 2 s x 2 d y 1 m π t z 1 0 0 0 y 1 d y

simplest bi level programming model because it is an np hard problem ben ayed and blair 1990 many studies have developed different solutions such as the karush kuhn tucker approach shi et al 2005 developed an extended branch and bound algorithm to solve a linear blp model by applying theorem 1 thereby allowing the standard bi level model to be transformed into a single level model then this model can be solved theorem 1 make u r p v r q and w r m the dual variables associated with the constraints a 1 x b 1 y z 1 and a 2 x b 2 y z 2 a necessary and sufficient condition for x y to solve

river basin 5 1 study area sichuan province in southwest china has an average rainfall of about 489 billion cubic meters per year and total water resources of about 349 billion cubic meters the study area was minjiang river one of the main tributaries in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and the largest tributary in the yangtze river basin the minjiang river flows through 10 cities as shown in fig 2 in recent years the ecological environment in the upper minjiang river area has changed dramatically with rapid social economic development urbanization has accelerated which in turn has accelerated industrial agricultural and daily use water usage further agricultural pollution industrial wastewater pollution and urban sewage have worsened water quality resulting in falling water yields and a deteriorating ecological environment because of these serious water use and pollution issues 10 cities in the minjiang river basin were chosen to evaluate water use and wastewater treatment efficiencies the minjiang river flows through 10 cities chengdu leshan yaan aba ganzi zigong neijiang meishan yibin and liangshan the data set included 10 observations of the water use subsystems and the wastewater treatment subsystems the performance of each dmu was characterized by inputs and outputs from these two subsystems as shown in table 1 the data shown in table 2 were taken from the national chinese bureau of statistics and the china knowledge resource integrated database 5 2 results as can be seen in table 3 the blp deawf model indicated that complete water system in neijiang was cost efficient overall as the two subsystems were both cost efficient while the other nine cities were found to be cost inefficient overall leshan and meishan were found to have cost efficient wastewater treatment subsystem but cost inefficient water use subsystem which validated proposition 2 1 water use subsystem cost efficiency only neijiang had a cost efficient water use subsystem the conditions in aba yaan leshan meishan zigong and chengdu were moderate indicating that the efficiency needs to be improved however the efficiencies in yibin liangshan and ganzi were very low indicating the need for immediate attention the water use subsystem cost efficiency in ganzi was 0 24166276 which was the lowest water use efficiency score primarily because of the excessive water consumption in ganzi compared to the other areas for example compared to neijiang 36 534 m3 ganzi consumed 40 776 m3 of freshwater at the same time the gdp output in ganzi was only 488 550 million rmb which was significantly lower than in neijiang 7 235 800 million rmb 2 wastewater treatment subsystem cost efficiency as the wastewater treatment subsystem cost efficiencies in leshan meishan and neijiang were the same they could not be compared therefore a super efficiency dea model that can show a wider range of changes as well as distinguish the effective dmus was applied as shown in table 4 the wastewater treatment efficiency in meishan was the highest at 2 6 followed by leshan 1 2 and then neijiang 1 05 as the other seven cities were all cost inefficient their respective values remained the same zigong aba and ganzi had the lowest efficiencies respectively 0 44919675 0 23865262 and 0 17824996 ganzi discharged 2488 million tonnes of wastewater but only 65 million tonnes of purified water were reused in production therefore as these three cities purified little wastewater for reuse in production there is significant room for improvement 3 cost efficiency differences between two subsystems as shown in table 3 water use subsystem cost efficiencies were higher than wastewater treatment subsystem cost efficiencies in yaan aba ganzi chengdu and zigong the water use subsystem cost efficiencies were lower than the wastewater treatment subsystem cost efficiencies in leshan meishan yibin and liangshan and the cost efficiencies were the same for the two subsystems in neijiang as verified by the average efficiency scores for the water use subsystem and the wastewater treatment subsystem at 0 637463723 and 0 627230166 respectively these results indicated that the local government in sichuan province needs to pay greater attention to the cities that have fewer water resources with these cities needing to focus more on wastewater treatment to improve their water system efficiencies however as the water use and wastewater treatment subsystem ce values were both relatively low in some cities both should be considered simultaneously when formulating policies to improve water system performances table 3 table 4 and fig 3 reveal three main findings 1 the average cost efficiency water use subsystem and wastewater treatment subsystem values were 0 637463723 and 0 627230166 indicating that the water use cost efficiencies were higher than the wastewater treatment cost efficiencies in most cities 2 the water system was shown to be cost efficient only when the water use and wastewater treatment subsystems were both cost efficient thereby supporting proposition 1 3 from the results and from fig 3 the complete water system cost efficiency always falls between the water use and wastewater treatment subsystems cost efficiencies thereby supporting proposition 2 5 3 comparison analysis a comparison was made between the proposed model and 1 a traditional dea model and 2 a blp dea model table 3 shows the different efficiencies obtained from the above two comparative models which proved that the developed model is able to provide more comprehensive information and has a greater potential to identify areas for further development 5 3 1 traditional dea and blp deawf the traditional dea model which only considers the initial inputs and final outputs without considering the relationship between the subsystems lacks scientific rigor and rationality and can only give complete system results table 3 shows the cost efficiencies determined from the traditional dea and blp deawf models the traditional model indicated that both neijiang and meishan were cost efficient overall however the proposed model only found neijiang to be cost efficient overall as while the wastewater treatment subsystem in meishan was found to be cost efficient the water use subsystem in meishan was cost inefficient therefore according to proposition 2 meishan is cost inefficient overall therefore the traditional dea model was unable to distinguish the cost efficiencies of each subsystem 1 the blp deawf model has stronger discriminating power the traditional model possibly overrates the cost efficiencies for example the traditional dea model found neijiang and meishan to have highly efficient systems i e they are cost efficient overall however the complete system efficiency between neijiang and meishan could not be compared however by using the super efficiency dea to obtain the results in table 4 the complete system efficiency in meishan 1 30709141 was found to be higher than in neijiang 2 74975915 with the overall ranking order being as follows neijiang meishan leshan aba yaan liangshan chengdu zigong yibin and ganzi the blp deawf model however only identified neijiang as being cost efficient overall because only the water use was cost inefficient in meishan i e meishan was cost inefficient overall after applying the super efficiency neijiang 1 1731794 and meishan 1 10868048 were both identified as being cost efficient with these being much lower than those generated from the traditional model further indicating that the traditional model overrated the complete system efficiencies in meishan and neijiang the reason for these differences is that the traditional dea model only considers the inputs and outputs for the complete system efficiency without considering the intermediate outputs from the water use subsystem therefore as the traditional dea model has fewer constraints than the blp deawf model the feasible region of the solution is larger therefore the traditional model tends to overestimate the cost efficiency 2 the blp deawf model is more reasonable and stable table 5 and table 6 show the results with a 20 increase in the inputs as a rule of thumb increasing the inputs should reduce the system efficiency using the proposed model the cost efficiencies of the complete system in leshan was 0 77638084 the water use subsystem was 0 69927719 and the wastewater treatment subsystem was 1 20884087 with a 20 increase in the inputs the complete system efficiency was 0 741501 in leshan the water use subsystem was 0 661486 and the wastewater treatment subsystem was 1 191403 that is respective efficiency reductions of 5 4 1 4 and 4 5 however using the traditional model the cost efficiencies of the complete system increased in the 10 cities for example the cost efficiency of the whole system in leshan was 0 69646419 but with a 20 increase in the inputs was 0 769297 an increase of 10 4 a similar situation was found for the other nine cities further compared with the previous results the order of efficiencies between the cities also changed before the 20 increase in the inputs the cost efficiency of the complete system in chengdu was higher than in zigong and the cost efficiency in liangshan was higher than in yibin however after the 20 increase in the inputs the cost efficiency of the complete system in chengdu was lower than in zigong while the cost efficiency of the complete system in yibin was higher than in liangshan these results again indicated that the traditional model lacks sensitivity because as it evaluates the cost efficiency of the complete system without considering the intermediate factors the cost efficiency results may become distorted therefore from these comparisons it can be concluded that the proposed model is more reasonable and effective overcomes the disadvantages of the traditional model as it accounts for the relationships within the system and can obtain more sensitive results for the subsystem and complete system efficiencies therefore the proposed model can assist managers more easily identify the inefficiencies in the internal subsystems 5 3 2 blp dea and blp deawf table 7 presents the cost efficiencies derived using the blp dea and blp deawf as can be seen there is a small increase in water use efficiency however the wastewater treatment efficiency remains unchanged and the complete system efficiency has a slight increase for example the blp dea model found the water use cost efficiency in yaan to be 0 725719 however the blp deawf model found the water use cost efficiency to be 0 728153 and the waste water treatment cost efficiency to be 0 626046 the other nine cities were also consistent with these results after using super efficiency on the two models the results were similar for example the blp dea model found the water use cost efficiency in aba to be 0 827745 and the blp deawf model found the water use cost efficiency in aba to be 0 830531 which was a little higher as was the cost efficiency for the complete system the other nine cities were also consistent with these results therefore the proposed model increased the cost efficiency of the complete water system 6 conclusion most studies have assessed water use and wastewater treatment subsystem efficiencies separately and ignored the relationships between the two subsystems however simultaneously improving the water use and wastewater treatment efficiencies is vital to future sustainable development this paper proposed a blp deawf model to evaluate the efficiencies in the two subsystems and the complete water system in 10 cities in the minjiang river basin the evaluation results indicated that this model was more accurate than in previous studies as the proposed approach allowed all dmus to be ranked and effectively dealt with the undesirable outputs therefore decision makers can more easily identify specific inefficient units and apply focused improvements after the analysis the following conclusions were made 1 a bi level subsystem analysis can identify which subsystems are performing better 2 the cost efficiency of the complete system always falls between the cost efficiencies of two subsystems 3 the complete system is cost efficient only if both subsystems are cost efficient the proposed model was compared with a traditional dea and a blp dea model from which it was found that the proposed blp deawf model could overcome many disadvantages by clearly showing the connections between the two subsystems the proposed model is able to improve the cost efficiency of complete water systems is more reasonable and stable and has stronger discriminating power than previous models this paper assumed that the water use subsystem produced both useful outputs gdp and undesirable outputs wastewater however to deeply study the internal factors that affect water use efficiency the water use subsystem could be further divided into a social water use subsystem and an economic water use subsystem further as there are certain uncertainties in water systems identifying and solving these is also an important part of the model all these issues are to be considered in future research acknowledgments we thank those who provided by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos

7250,clean water is crucial for sustainable economic and social development however around the world low water use efficiency and increasing water pollution have become serious problems to comprehensively evaluate water use and wastewater treatment this paper integrated bi level programming blp and data envelopment analysis dea with a feedback variable to deal with poor output to rank dmus using a super efficiency dea the proposed model was applied to a case study of 10 cities in the minjiang river basin to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness from which it was found that a water system can only be cost efficient when both the water use and wastewater treatment subsystems are both cost efficient the comparison analysis demonstrated that the proposed model was more discriminating and stable than traditional dea models and was able to better improve total water system cost efficiencies than a blp dea model keywords bi level programming data envelopment analysis cost efficiency water use wastewater treatment 1 introduction water is essential for all social and economic activities pedro monzon s et al 2015 hanasaki et al 2013 growing populations and rapid economic development have resulted in adverse environmental impacts water scarcity and serious water pollution han et al 2016 kummu et al 2010 further in many cases water is either wasted or water use efficiency is extremely low all of which aggravates the possibility of a serious water crisis fortunately it has been realized that total water system efficiency involves both water use and also wastewater treatment therefore the evaluation of water use and wastewater treatment efficiencies has become an urgent research focus over the past few decades water use efficiency has gained increasing attention wen et al 2014 developed an optimization model for the large scale use of surface and ground water resources and singh 2016 developed formulas and applications for two optimization models to maximize the net farming revenue of an irrigated area in northwest india by optimally allocating available water and land resources however to accurately judge the multiple inputs and outputs dea models have been proven to be a much more useful way to evaluate the relative performance of a set of production processes or decision making units dmus as they do not require exact production functions charnes et al 1978 for example romano and guerrini 2011 used a dea model to compare 43 water utility companies in italy and gao et al 2013 developed a water use efficiency evaluation model based on a projection pursuit and screened the indexes using an analytic hierarchy process although these methods can also be used to evaluate water use efficiency they only account for the initial inputs and final outputs without considering the relationships between the subsystems or the intermediate outputs such as wastewater or reused water therefore to factor in such dmus and recognize the interlinked levels using multi level stackelberg relationships this paper develops a new approach to describe the structure that considers the internal operations of the water system because of the importance of environmental protection and sustainable development wastewater reuse has been recognized as a viable solution to global water scarcity garcia and pargament 2015 technologies have been developed for wastewater reuse such as oxidants biological treatment physical separation and electrochemical treatments norton brandao et al 2013 to evaluate the efficiency of wastewater treatments yang et al 2015 measured china s environmental efficiency using an environmental super efficiency dea model in 30 chinese provinces from 2000 to 2010 and wu et al 2018 used an input oriented non radical dea model to examine the construction efficiencies in urban sewers and wastewater treatments in 70 chinese megacities from 2006 to 2012 however most studies have only considered ideal outputs such as economic benefits and have ignored the undesirable outputs such as discharged wastewater that are generated at the same time as the desirable outputs which has directly affected the efficiency measures of the dmus to improve efficiency therefore the desirable outputs must increase at the same time that the undesirable outputs decrease further in many studies the wastewater treatment subsystems have been considered separately however if these two subsystems are separately considered the performance of the complete water resource system may be biased therefore these methods may be unsuitable for evaluating complete system efficiency using a recovery network structure in recent years while some research has examined undesirable output again it has not integrated water use with wastewater treatment for example deng et al 2016 proposed a slacks based measurement dea sbm dea model to evaluate water use efficiency in 31 chinese provinces from 2004 to 2013 zhou et al 2017 proposed a type 2 fuzzy bi objective two stage sbm dea model to evaluate the performance of an integrated two stage system morteza et al 2016 used a blp dea model that examined the internal structure using stackelberg game relationships to evaluate the performance of a banking chain and zhou et al 2017 developed a novel blp dea model with multiple followers to evaluate the performance of a bi level system that included two kinds of players to examine the undesirable outputs associated with water use and wastewater treatment bian et al 2014 measured the efficiency of water resource systems in china using a two stage dea approach and zhou et al 2018 assessed the performance of an integrated wuwt system using a mixed network two stage sbm dea model therefore different kinds of dea models have been developed to measure the dmus and have already attained some viable results however there has been no successful attempt to solve and rank dmus for the reused water from the wastewater treatment subsystem to achieve cost efficiency therefore this paper develops an integrated bi level programming dea model with a feedback variable blp deawf to evaluate the cost efficiencies of water use and wastewater treatment this paper makes the following major contributions to current literature 1 the proposed model includes the internal system structure and interactions to provide decision makers with specific comprehensive information about the overall system 2 in the overall water system the water use and wastewater treatment subsystems are proven to have a mutual effect because of the intermediate wastewater and reused water between the subsystems 3 the proposed model deals with undesirable output and therefore assesses the issues associated with sustainable development and has greater environmental benefits 4 to ensure a wider range of values to allow all dmus to be ranked super efficiency is used to resolve the problems associated with multiple dmus having the same efficiency value the developed blp deawf model is proven to be more reliable and to provide a more comprehensive performance evaluation the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 states the problem and gives the fundamental knowledge for the model section 3 develops the model and provides the definitions propositions of the model section 4 discusses the solution method for the model section 5 presents a case study to evaluate the efficiency of regional water and a comparison analysis is given to demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the developed model and conclusions are presented in section 6 2 problem statement to develop the blp deawf method this section presents the cost efficiency of water use and wastewater treatment subsystem and the evaluation of the complete water system a single water resource system can be divided into a water use subsystem and a wastewater treatment subsystem bian et al 2014 the performance of each subsystem can be separately evaluated as the two subsystems have individual objectives and decision variables however they also have mutual influences and restrictions the water use subsystem can be considered the upper level the leader which utilizes several inputs such as fresh water capital investment and reused water to produce the desirable gdp output and also has undesirable discharge wastewater outputs the goal of the upper level is to minimize the total costs of the water system by using the least inputs for the given outputs the wastewater treatment subsystem can be considered the lower level the follower the goal of which is to minimize the subsystem costs by minimizing discharged wastewater wastewater treatment costs and investment capital the capital invested in the two subsystems should be less than a given value because of the need to minimize costs and restrict inputs however while the capital invested in the wastewater treatment subsystem is decided by the follower it is based on the leader s decisions therefore the leader s decisions and the follower s decisions have a mutual influence the lower level system makes decisions based on the leader s decisions and the upper level makes decisions based on full information from the lower level therefore the lower level needs to be embedded into the upper decision making to ensure full consideration is given to the decision makers on the two levels a bi level model has the ability to expose the inner structure of the bi level system and reveal the interactions between the two levels thereby considering the reused water which is the output of the wastewater treatment subsystem and the input for the water use subsystem the blp deawf decision framework is shown in fig 1 3 modeling the performance of the two subsystems needs to be evaluated so that the natural structures or characteristics of the system are fully considered therefore this model must be able to consider the different objectives on both levels at the same time as part of the complete decision framework 3 1 notations to clearly present the modeling process in the following notations the

uses its direct inputs which are shared between the two levels to produce intermediate outputs and direct outputs as cost efficiency is being used to evaluate the efficiency of each dmu minimizing total costs is the goal of the upper level based on the proposed cost efficiency dea model sarrico 2001 the total costs are determined by multiplying the input unit costs made up of the direct freshwater input x 1 d the wastewater treatment costs x 2 d the shared input capital x 1 s x 2 s the intermediate input of discharged wastewater y 1 m and the feedback input reused water y 2 f the unit cost for the fresh water is c 1 d and the unit cost of the wastewater treatment is c 2 d therefore the direct input costs are c 1 d x 1 d c 2 d x 2 d the unit costs associated with the shared inputs are c 1 s and c 2 s respectively and the shared input costs are c 1 s x 1 s c 2 s x 2 s the two unit costs for the discharged wastewater is c 2 m therefore the intermediate input costs are c 2 m y 1 m the unit 1 costs for the reused water are c f and the feedback input costs are c f y 2 f put together the total costs are minimized as 1 min c leader c 1 d x 1 d c 2 d x 2 d c 1 s x 1 s c 2 s

the linear combinations for j dmus feedback input is j 1 j y 2 j f λ j with the linear combination of the feedback input to all dmus being less than or equal to the feedback input for the dmuj then

upper level s intermediate output discharge wastewater from dmuj the linear combinations for j dmus intermediate output are j 1 j y 1 j m λ j with the linear combinations for the intermediate output to all dmus being equal to or greater than the direct input to the dmuj then the output constraints are as follows 3 j 1 j y 1 j d λ j y 1 d j 1 j y 1 j m λ j y 1 m 3 shared resources constraint as the shared inputs on the two levels are limited the total shared inputs between the two levels should be less than a fixed constant g due to resource limits 4 x 1 s x 2 s g 3 4 lower level goal when the leader minimizes the total costs the follower consumes the direct input wastewater treatment cost x 2 d the shared input between the two levels x 2 s and the intermediate input y 1 m from the leader to produce the final chemical organic output y 2 c and ammonia nitrogen y 2 n as the wastewater treatment unit costs are c 2 d the direct input cost is c 2 d x 2 d the shared input unit cost for the wastewater treatment subsystem is c 2 s and the shared input cost is c 2 s x 2 s the discharged wastewater unit costs are c 2 m and the intermediate input costs are c 2 m y 1 m therefore the total costs for the follower are minimized as follows 5 min c follower c 2 s x 2 s c 2 d x 2 d c 2 m y 1 m 3 5 lower level limitations 1 input constraints similar to the upper level subsystem x 2 j s

input of the dmuj y 1 j m is the wastewater treatment subsystem intermediate discharged wastewater input in dmuj and the linear combinations for the j dmus intermediate input are j 1 j y 1 j m π j which should less than or equal to the intermediate input for dmuj then the input constraints are as follows 6 j 1 j x 2 j s π j x 2 s j 1 j x 2 j d π j x 2 d j 1 j y 1 j m π j y 1 m 2 output

output in dmuj and the linear combination for the j dmus feedback output is j 1 j y 2 j f π j with the linear combinations for the feedback output to all dmus being equal to or greater than the direct

proposition 2 reveals that the water system is cost efficient if and only if water use subsystem and wastewater treatment subsystem are both cost efficient 4 solution method the solution method for the proposed model is divided into three steps 1 transform model 8 into a standard linear blp model 2 transform the standard blp model into a single level model and 3 use existing branch and bound algorithms to solve the standard linear blp shi et al 2005 the step by step transformation of the model is shown in the following let x x 1 s x 1 d y 2 f λ t y x 2 s x 2 d y 1 m π t z 1 0 0 0 y 1 d y

simplest bi level programming model because it is an np hard problem ben ayed and blair 1990 many studies have developed different solutions such as the karush kuhn tucker approach shi et al 2005 developed an extended branch and bound algorithm to solve a linear blp model by applying theorem 1 thereby allowing the standard bi level model to be transformed into a single level model then this

river basin 5 1 study area sichuan province in southwest china has an average rainfall of about 489 billion cubic meters per year and total water resources of about 349 billion cubic meters the study area was minjiang river one of the main tributaries in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and the largest tributary in the yangtze river basin the minjiang river flows through 10 cities as shown in fig 2 in recent years the ecological environment in the upper minjiang river area has changed dramatically with rapid social economic development urbanization has accelerated which in turn has accelerated industrial agricultural and daily use water usage further agricultural pollution industrial wastewater pollution and urban sewage have worsened water quality resulting in falling water yields and a deteriorating ecological environment because of these serious water use and pollution issues 10 cities in the minjiang river basin were chosen to evaluate water use and wastewater treatment efficiencies the minjiang river flows through 10 cities chengdu leshan yaan aba ganzi zigong neijiang meishan yibin and liangshan the data set included 10 observations of the water use subsystems and the wastewater treatment subsystems the performance of each dmu was characterized by inputs and outputs from these two subsystems as shown in table 1 the data shown in table 2 were taken from the national chinese bureau of statistics and the china knowledge resource integrated database 5 2 results as can be seen in table 3 the blp deawf model indicated that complete water system in neijiang was cost efficient overall as the two subsystems were both cost efficient while the other nine cities were found to be cost inefficient overall leshan and meishan were found to have cost efficient wastewater treatment subsystem but cost inefficient water use subsystem which validated proposition 2 1 water use subsystem cost efficiency only neijiang had a cost efficient water use subsystem the conditions in aba yaan leshan meishan zigong and chengdu were moderate indicating that the efficiency needs to be improved however the efficiencies in yibin liangshan and ganzi were very low indicating the need for immediate attention the water use subsystem cost efficiency in ganzi was 0 24166276 which was the lowest water use efficiency score primarily because of the excessive water consumption in ganzi compared to the other areas for example compared to neijiang 36 534 m3 ganzi consumed 40 776 m3 of freshwater at the same time the gdp output in ganzi was only 488 550 million rmb which was significantly lower than in neijiang 7 235 800 million rmb 2 wastewater treatment subsystem cost efficiency as the wastewater treatment subsystem cost efficiencies in leshan meishan and neijiang were the same they could not be compared therefore a super efficiency dea model that can show a wider range of changes as well as distinguish the effective dmus was applied as shown in table 4 the wastewater treatment efficiency in meishan was the highest at 2 6 followed by leshan 1 2 and then neijiang 1 05 as the other seven cities were all cost inefficient their respective values remained the same zigong aba and ganzi had the lowest efficiencies respectively 0 44919675 0 23865262 and 0 17824996 ganzi discharged 2488 million tonnes of wastewater but only 65 million tonnes of purified water were reused in production therefore as these three cities purified little wastewater for reuse in production there is significant room for improvement 3 cost efficiency differences between two subsystems as shown in table 3 water use subsystem cost efficiencies were higher than wastewater treatment subsystem cost efficiencies in yaan aba ganzi chengdu and zigong the water use subsystem cost efficiencies were lower than the wastewater treatment subsystem cost efficiencies in leshan meishan yibin and liangshan and the cost efficiencies were the same for the two subsystems in neijiang as verified by the average efficiency scores for the water use subsystem and the wastewater treatment subsystem at 0 637463723 and 0 627230166 respectively these results indicated that the local government in sichuan province needs to pay greater attention to the cities that have fewer water resources with these cities needing to focus more on wastewater treatment to improve their water system efficiencies however as the water use and wastewater treatment subsystem ce values were both relatively low in some cities both should be considered simultaneously when formulating policies to improve water system performances table 3 table 4 and fig 3 reveal three main findings 1 the average cost efficiency water use subsystem and wastewater treatment subsystem values were 0 637463723 and 0 627230166 indicating that the water use cost efficiencies were higher than the wastewater treatment cost efficiencies in most cities 2 the water system was shown to be cost efficient only when the water use and wastewater treatment subsystems were both cost efficient thereby supporting proposition 1 3 from the results and from fig 3 the complete water system cost efficiency always falls between the water use and wastewater treatment subsystems cost efficiencies thereby supporting proposition 2 5 3 comparison analysis a comparison was made between the proposed model and 1 a traditional dea model and 2 a blp dea model table 3 shows the different efficiencies obtained from the above two comparative models which proved that the developed model is able to provide more comprehensive information and has a greater potential to identify areas for further development 5 3 1 traditional dea and blp deawf the traditional dea model which only considers the initial inputs and final outputs without considering the relationship between the subsystems lacks scientific rigor and rationality and can only give complete system results table 3 shows the cost efficiencies determined from the traditional dea and blp deawf models the traditional model indicated that both neijiang and meishan were cost efficient overall however the proposed model only found neijiang to be cost efficient overall as while the wastewater treatment subsystem in meishan was found to be cost efficient the water use subsystem in meishan was cost inefficient therefore according to proposition 2 meishan is cost inefficient overall therefore the traditional dea model was unable to distinguish the cost efficiencies of each subsystem 1 the blp deawf model has stronger discriminating power the traditional model possibly overrates the cost efficiencies for example the traditional dea model found neijiang and meishan to have highly efficient systems i e they are cost efficient overall however the complete system efficiency between neijiang and meishan could not be compared however by using the super efficiency dea to obtain the results in table 4 the complete system efficiency in meishan 1 30709141 was found to be higher than in neijiang 2 74975915 with the overall ranking order being as follows neijiang meishan leshan aba yaan liangshan chengdu zigong yibin and ganzi the blp deawf model however only identified neijiang as being cost efficient overall because only the water use was cost inefficient in meishan i e meishan was cost inefficient overall after applying the super efficiency neijiang 1 1731794 and meishan 1 10868048 were both identified as being cost efficient with these being much lower than those generated from the traditional model further indicating that the traditional model overrated the complete system efficiencies in meishan and neijiang the reason for these differences is that the traditional dea model only considers the inputs and outputs for the complete system efficiency without considering the intermediate outputs from the water use subsystem therefore as the traditional dea model has fewer constraints than the blp deawf model the feasible region of the solution is larger therefore the traditional model tends to overestimate the cost efficiency 2 the blp deawf model is more reasonable and stable table 5 and table 6 show the results with a 20 increase in the inputs as a rule of thumb increasing the inputs should reduce the system efficiency using the proposed model the cost efficiencies of the complete system in leshan was 0 77638084 the water use subsystem was 0 69927719 and the wastewater treatment subsystem was 1 20884087 with a 20 increase in the inputs the complete system efficiency was 0 741501 in leshan the water use subsystem was 0 661486 and the wastewater treatment subsystem was 1 191403 that is respective efficiency reductions of 5 4 1 4 and 4 5 however using the traditional model the cost efficiencies of the complete system increased in the 10 cities for example the cost efficiency of the whole system in leshan was 0 69646419 but with a 20 increase in the inputs was 0 769297 an increase of 10 4 a similar situation was found for the other nine cities further compared with the previous results the order of efficiencies between the cities also changed before the 20 increase in the inputs the cost efficiency of the complete system in chengdu was higher than in zigong and the cost efficiency in liangshan was higher than in yibin however after the 20 increase in the inputs the cost efficiency of the complete system in chengdu was lower than in zigong while the cost efficiency of the complete system in yibin was higher than in liangshan these results again indicated that the traditional model lacks sensitivity because as it evaluates the cost efficiency of the complete system without considering the intermediate factors the cost efficiency results may become distorted therefore from these comparisons it can be concluded that the proposed model is more reasonable and effective overcomes the disadvantages of the traditional model as it accounts for the relationships within the system and can obtain more sensitive results for the subsystem and complete system efficiencies therefore the proposed model can assist managers more easily identify the inefficiencies in the internal subsystems 5 3 2 blp dea and blp deawf table 7 presents the cost efficiencies derived using the blp dea and blp deawf as can be seen there is a small increase in water use efficiency however the wastewater treatment efficiency remains unchanged and the complete system efficiency has a slight increase for example the blp dea model found the water use cost efficiency in yaan to be 0 725719 however the blp deawf model found the water use cost efficiency to be 0 728153 and the waste water treatment cost efficiency to be 0 626046 the other nine cities were also consistent with these results after using super efficiency on the two models the results were similar for example the blp dea model found the water use cost efficiency in aba to be 0 827745 and the blp deawf model found the water use cost efficiency in aba to be 0 830531 which was a little higher as was the cost efficiency for the complete system the other nine cities were also consistent with these results therefore the proposed model increased the cost efficiency of the complete water system 6 conclusion most studies have assessed water use and wastewater treatment subsystem efficiencies separately and ignored the relationships between the two subsystems however simultaneously improving the water use and wastewater treatment efficiencies is vital to future sustainable development this paper proposed a blp deawf model to evaluate the efficiencies in the two subsystems and the complete water system in 10 cities in the minjiang river basin the evaluation results indicated that this model was more accurate than in previous studies as the proposed approach allowed all dmus to be ranked and effectively dealt with the undesirable outputs therefore decision makers can more easily identify specific inefficient units and apply focused improvements after the analysis the following conclusions were made 1 a bi level subsystem analysis can identify which subsystems are performing better 2 the cost efficiency of the complete system always falls between the cost efficiencies of two subsystems 3 the complete system is cost efficient only if both subsystems are cost efficient the proposed model was compared with a traditional dea and a blp dea model from which it was found that the proposed blp deawf model could overcome many disadvantages by clearly showing the connections between the two subsystems the proposed model is able to improve the cost efficiency of complete water systems is more reasonable and stable and has stronger discriminating power than previous models this paper assumed that the water use subsystem produced both useful outputs gdp and undesirable outputs wastewater however to deeply study the internal factors that affect water use efficiency the water use subsystem could be further divided into a social water use subsystem and an economic water use subsystem further as there are certain uncertainties in water systems identifying and solving these is also an important part of the model all these issues are to be considered in future research acknowledgments we thank those who provided by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos

7251,pines in semi arid mountain environments manage to survive and thrive despite the limited soil water due to shallow soil depths and overall water scarcity this study aims to develop a method for computing soil evaporation bedrock water uptake and transpiration from a natural open forest based on sap flow heat ratio method soil moisture and meteorological observations the water balance of individual trees was conceptualized with a geometric approach using canopy projected areas and voronoi thiesen polygons the canopy approach assumes that the tree s root area extent is equal to its canopy projected area while the voronoi approach assumes that the tree roots exploit the open area that is closer to the tree than to any other tree the methodology was applied in an open pinus brutia forest 68 canopy cover in cyprus characterized by steep slopes and fractured bedrock during two hydrologically contrasting years 2015 wet 2016 dry sap flow sensors soil moisture sensors throughfall and stemflow gauges were installed on and around eight trees rainfall was 507 mm in 2015 and 359 mm in 2016 according to the canopy approach the sum of tree transpiration and soil evaporation exceeded the throughfall in both years which implies that the trees bedrock water uptake exceeds the surface runoff and drainage losses this indicated that trees extend their roots beyond the canopy projected areas and the use of the voronoi polygons captures this effect according to the stand scale water balance average throughfall during the two years was 81 of the rainfall transpiration was 61 of the rainfall in 2015 but only 32 in 2016 on the contrary the soil evaporation fraction increased from 26 in 2015 to 35 in the dry year of 2016 the contribution of bedrock water to tree transpiration was 77 of rainfall in 2015 and 66 in 2016 during the summer months trees relied 100 on the uptake of water from the fractured bedrock to cover their transpiration needs average monthly transpiration areas ranged between 0 1 mm d 1 in october 2016 and 1 7 mm d 1 in april 2015 this study shows that bedrock uptake could be an essential water balance component of semi arid mountainous pine forests and should be accounted for in hydrologic models keywords pinus brutia semi arid throughfall evapotranspiration sap flow bedrock water uptake 1 introduction mediterranean pines survive in semi arid mountainous areas because of their adaptation to long dry seasons and shallow soil environments chambel et al 2013 climate projections show rising temperatures and declining rainfall trends for the mediterranean region polade et al 2017 in the same context hydrometeorological observations and analyses indicate a continental drying in the past decades which does however contradict with observed trends of continental greening milly and dunne 2016 milly et al 2011 2016 show that the application of potential evapotranspiration models with data from climate models neglects surface energy balances and changes in stomatal control related to increasing co2 rates leading to large biases in hydrologic simulations and the overestimation of evapotranspiration in non water stressed conditions observed trends in the parameters that affect atmospheric evaporative demand also indicate that increases in future potential evapotranspiration may be less severe than projected significant variations in the solar radiation incident at the earth s surface associated with aerosols clouds and aerosol cloud interactions solar dimming have a profound effect on surface albedo and potential evapotranspiration wild 2009 observed trends of increasing atmospheric surface humidity willett et al 2008 and global reductions in wind speeds mcvicar et al 2012 also affect evaporative demand however while future increases in potential evapotranspiration could be less than expected from off line model simulations the impact of these differences may be small in water limited environments mcvicar et al 2012 still the many uncertain changes that face our environment call for an increased understanding of evapotranspiration processes in water limited environments evapotranspiration et is a major unknown variable in the understanding of ecohydrological systems kool et al 2014 globally et is about 67 of the precipitation p zhang et al 2016 while in dry regions it can reach 95 wilcox et al 2003 the different components of et vary per region according to the water and energy availability and the land cover characteristics zhang et al 2016 at a global scale transpiration through the stomata of plants t makes up 65 evaporation from soil es 25 and evaporation of water intercepted by the plant canopy i 10 of the total et zhang et al 2016 the partitioning of et into t es and i is important for hydrologic ecologic forest and agricultural studies balugani et al 2017 guan and wilson 2009 canopy interception is highly heterogeneous in semi arid forests which are frequently characterised by sparse spatial vegetation patterns where trees form vegetated patches that sharply contrast with open areas of bare soil or ephemeral plants domingo et al 1998 shachnovich et al 2008 forest patch characteristics influence throughfall pt and stemflow ps ghimire et al 2012 the mediterranean climate with warm temperatures and high evapotranspiration rates favours interception losses however the occurrence of heavy storms reduces the intercepted fraction bellot et al 1999 dunkerley 2009 rainfall interception has been thoroughly studied in horizontally uniform forests in temperate and tropical climates but fewer studies can be found for dry climates and open forests david et al 2006 dunkerley 2010 hassan et al 2017 llorens and domingo 2007 made an extensive review of rainfall interception by trees and shrubs in mediterranean conditions and concluded that it is highly variable and that more studies should be done on characteristic mediterranean species tree species survive in water limited environments by developing various adaptation mechanisms to access water lubczynski 2009 thus influencing the water balance components of a given locale tree transpiration can be the dominant evapotranspiration component in semi arid areas and can even exceed rainfall in case of groundwater uptake by deep rooted plants zhao et al 2016 schwinning 2010 noted that trees and shrubs take up substantial amounts of water from weathered bedrock after soil water has become unavailable they do so by expanding their root systems in the rock layers below widening fractures by exposing more rock surfaces to solution weathering until water demands are met or water simply runs out schwinning 2010 the quantification of groundwater and bedrock water uptake is especially important in dry environments such as to understand the effect of forests on water resources balugani et al 2017 witty et al 2003 sap flow measurements are widely used for investigating ecohydrological processes and for quantifying transpiration of trees benyon et al 2017 fan et al 2016 reyes acosta and lubczynski 2014 zhao et al 2016 sap flow is influenced by plant physiological characteristics such as stomatal control and tree hydraulic conductance lubczynski 2009 aranda et al 2005 by meteorological factors such as rainfall and droughts shen et al 2015 temperature vapour pressure deficit and net solar radiation huang et al 2011 by the soil properties peng et al 2015 and by geomorphological factors shimizu et al 2015 sap flow observations can provide information about the functional traits of trees the tree to tree variability and the factors that influence this variability thus facilitating the choice of the proper upscaling technique to the entire plot kume et al 2016 2012 pinto et al 2014 the knowledge of the lateral areal extent of the roots of individual trees is important for relating volumetric sapflow measurements to the evaporative demand of the atmosphere and the application of one dimensional evapotranspiration models david et al 2013 pinto et al 2014 the root area of individual trees is often assumed to be equal to the canopy projected area crown reyes acosta and lubczynski 2013 shen et al 2015 wieser et al 2014 however tree roots in semi arid regions generally extend far beyond the projected crown radius wu et al 1985 transpiration in water limited environments would be overestimated if calculated by using the crown projected area and total evapotranspiration would exceed rainfall leading to significant errors in water balance calculations crosbie et al 2007 the areal extent of the roots can be estimated by excavation or root sampling but these techniques do not show information on the active roots walker et al 1989 furthermore such interventions disturb the root zone area may damage and destroy roots and disconnect them from sources of water david et al 2013 thus will affect the sap flow rates of trees crosbie et al 2007 used soil moisture measurements to delineate the area of influence of a tree belt in a 6 m deep soil however these techniques are impossible to apply for roots that grow in rocks as an alternative the areal extent of the roots of the trees is often approximated with the use of geometric methods walker et al 1989 wu et al 1985 in this study we propose a novel approach for the conversion of volumetric sap flow measurements to one dimensional transpiration of individual pine trees with the use of a geometric approach known as voronoi polygons also known as thiessen polygons these polygons divide the forest planar area by allocating it to the nearest tree thiessen polygons have been applied in ecological modelling plant growth and competition studies e g abellanas et al 2016 andrašev et al 2016 burkhart and tomé 2012 gspaltl et al 2012 liao et al 2013 lynch 2015 mcinnis et al 2004 however we have found no studies that used voronoi polygons for the computation of water balance components of individual trees tree competition studies have used and referred to voronoi polygons as area potentially available for a tree burkhart and tomé 2012 voronoi polygons assume that there is a direct linkage between plants performance and the spatial availability of resources berger et al 2008 trees may benefit from areas extending beyond their crowns open areas by receiving more light water and nutrients gspaltl et al 2012 omari et al 2016 mainwaring and maguire 2004 assert that voronoi polygons are a useful surrogate for the degree of root spread and the access to the available belowground resource pool voronoi polygons individual based neighbourhood models are often preferred over cellular automata site based neighbourhood models in ecological studies when there is not sufficient empirical knowledge to formulate empirical rules about tree completion berger et al 2008 schenk and jackson 2002 note that especially in water limited environments the availability of water to plants is highly dependent on their root systems and tree competition the main assumptions of the voronoi approach are that i the voronoi polygon of each tree is not influenced by the roots of neighbouring trees thus all the water resources within a voronoi polygon are taken up by a single tree and ii the area of the voronoi polygon is homogeneous assuming a uniform functioning and extent of the root area in the soil and bedrock thus the applicability of this method is restricted to single species forest stands nevertheless voronoi polygons obey the basic axiom of configuration in plant competition berger et al 2008 these polygons have the potential to represent the below ground plant competition for resources water nutrients but this potential has not been exploited berger et al 2008 czárán 1998 pinus brutia is a light demanding fast growing and drought resistant tree species with a deep rooting system zone which can grow in areas with mean annual rainfall as low as 350 mm boydak 2004 nahal 1983 pinus brutia covers a wide range in the eastern mediterranean from greece to the eastern crimea turkey georgia northern iraq western syria lebanon and cyprus chambel et al 2013 they usually grow in pure stands and they are valuable for their timber products for soil stabilization and wildlife habitats boydak 2004 pinus brutia are systematically close species to the better known pinus halepensis and where they co occur they hybridize frankis 1999 ganopoulos et al 2013 both of these species grow in the mediterranean basin under similar meteorological conditions and have similar radial growth rates liphschitz and mendel 1987 frankis 1999 but pinus brutia is more water demanding and less thermophilic than pinus halepensis chambel et al 2013 there is no scientific literature on pinus brutia transpiration and on their role in the forest water balance in contrast to pinus halepensis which have been studied extensively schiller and cohen 1998 ungar et al 2013 yaseef et al 2010 the specific objectives of this study are i to develop a method for computing soil evaporation bedrock uptake and areal transpiration from an open forest based on sap flow soil moisture and meteorological observations ii to compare the water balances of single pinus brutia trees using either canopy projected areas or voronoi polygons and iii to compute and compare the water balance components of the forest stand during two hydrologically contrasting years 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site characteristics are summarized in table 1 the area has a sloping topography with very shallow soils and fractured bedrock on top of the soil there is a thick layer of litter pine needles that reduces soil evaporation a small number of rockrose bushes cistus sp can be found in the rocky and open areas of the forest that are not shaded by the canopies of the pinus brutia trees fig 1 our observations in the study area found that the root areas of the trees have horizontal extents up to 10 m and that roots are commonly present in bedrock fractures supplementary material 1 it is a water limited environment and on average 53 of the rain falls between december and february while 4 falls between july and september camera et al 2014 water is only found in the top 30 m of the fractured bedrock and well yields are less than 1 m3 h 1 personal communication geological survey department of cyprus no baseflow was observed in the small ephemeral stream approximately 100 m downslope north of the study site s fence during the study period 2 2 pinus brutia biometrics we measured the diameter at breast height dbh of 122 trees more than half the number of the trees inside the study area during september and october 2014 we extracted small core samples from 45 trees using an increment borer 5 15 mm diameter to measure the sapwood depth we applied indicator dye methyl orange and methyl blue and determined the sapwood depth from the difference in colour between the sapwood and the heartwood area eight trees were selected for further monitoring we selected four trees with a dbh below the average dbh of the 122 trees 25 cm and four trees with a dbh above the average dbh referred to as tm1 tm2 tm3 tm4 and tm5 tm6 tm7 tm8 respectively fig 2 we measured the length of the longest branches in the eight cardinal and inter cardinal directions for each selected tree we estimated the canopy projected area of the eight trees with the triangulation method in arcgis 2 3 site characterization we used an electronic theodolite with a distance meter total station and a differential gps to create a high resolution 5 m digital elevation model dem of the western part of the 8966 m2 fenced study area with the same methods we recorded the exact location of the trees fig 1 after processing the dem in arcgis we created a slope map of the area burrough and mcdonnell 1998 jones 1998 we also used a measuring tape and a compass to define the canopy covered areas and the open areas we created a 1 m square grid around each of the eight selected trees and we measured the soil depth at each grid point a total of 540 points with the use of a metal stick utility probe hammer and measuring tape voronoi polygons were created with the triangulation method in arcgis 2 4 meteorological data monitoring meteorological data from an automatic station located on an open area at the upslope end of the study site fig 1 were provided by the department of forests rainfall is measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge with 0 1 mm resolution at 1 m height above ground surface air temperature and relative air humidity are measured at 2 m height solar radiation is measured by a pyranometer w m 2 wind speed and direction are measured at 10 m height 2 5 sap flow we used four sap flow heat ratio method hrm instruments burgess and downey 2014 to determine sap flow rates of the tm2 tm4 tm6 and tm7 trees for the period from 01 jan 2015 to 31 dec 2016 we installed four additional sap flow instruments on trees tm1 tm3 tm5 and tm8 for the period from 20 oct 2015 to 31 dec 2016 these instruments have a resolution of 0 01 cm h 1 and have the capacity to measure reverse sap flow rates as well burgess and downey 2014 we installed one sensor at 1 3 m height facing north in all trees for the long term sap flow measurements azimuthal sapflow measurements eliades et al in review showed that the sap velocity of the north facing sensors was on average 1 lower than the average sap velocity of all four azimuth sensors for trees tm1 tm2 tm3 and tm4 july august 2017 and 3 7 lower than the south facing sensor for trees tm6 and tm7 december 2014 august 2015 the hrm consists of a set of two measurement needles downstream and upstream and one central needle heater that releases a heat pulse the two measurement needles have thermistors positioned exactly at 7 5 mm and 22 5 mm from the tip of the measurement needles the hrm determines the increase in temperature at these two points after the release of the heat pulse we inserted the three needles radially into the xylem tissue of the bark at the breast height of the trees we used a drill guide with three holes spaced 5 mm apart to minimize needle misalignment during insertion the instrument was set up to send a pulse every 60 min the heat pulse velocity vh cm h 1 was calculated according to burgess et al 2001 as follows 1 v h k x ln v 1 v 2 3600 where k is the thermal diffusivity of the fresh wood cm2 s 1 x is the distance between the heater and the measurement needles 0 5 cm and v1 and v2 are the differences between the initial temperature c at the two thermocouples downstream and upstream flow of the heater respectively and the temperature measured after a heat pulse was released the diffusivity k was computed after determining the thermal properties of wood the thermal diffusivity was determined according to the procedures of vandegehuchte and steppe 2012 the installation procedure computations and corrections for natural thermal gradients ntg wound and misalignment of the needles were conducted according to burgess et al 1998 2001 and vandegehuchte et al 2015 the sap velocity vs was then calculated according to burgess et al 2001 with the use of the sap flow tool software burgess and downey 2014 for the conversion of sap velocity to sap flow we multiplied the sap velocity vs with the corresponding cross sectional area of the sapwood ax we applied linear regressions between sap flow sensors to fill in any missing hourly data the missing hourly data ranged from 1 tm3 to 14 tm4 and sap flow sensors showed high linear correlations r 0 91 0 98 according to cohen et al 2008 in pinus halepensis trees in a semi arid area sap velocities are highest near the cambium and decrease with distance from the cambium furthermore liphschitz and mendel 1987 showed that pinus halepensis and pinus brutia have similar radial growth responses so we assumed that the decrease of the sap velocity in relation to the distance from the cambium is similar in both species heat field deformation measurements hfd8 100 ict international on tree tm1 between november 2015 and april 2016 and on four more trees within the study site march april 2018 confirmed the linear decrease of sap velocity with sapwood depth thus we computed the sap velocity beyond the last thermistor by applying a linear decrease function in all hrm sensors the hfd instrument measures sap flux densities at 1 cm intervals at eight sapwood depths 2 9 cm and computations were conducted according to nadezhdina et al 1998 finally we computed a correlation matrix between average sap velocities total sap flow and biometric parameters stem sapwood canopy projected and voronoi areas 2 6 rainfall partitioning sixteen manual rain gauges climemet with a funnel diameter of 10 cm and two storing and measuring cylinders an inner one with a 25 mm capacity and an outer one with a 225 mm capacity were placed randomly under the trees canopies to measure throughfall fig 1 after rainfall events exceeding 25 mm the inner cylinder reaches its maximum capacity and the additional water is stored in the outer tube we conducted a one way analysis of variance anova to test the hypothesis that all sixteen gauges receive the same throughfall fraction the analysis was done with the ibm spss statistical analysis software twelve additional manual rain gauges were placed under the trees canopies in january 2016 for stemflow we installed a flexible pvc tube with silicon glue around each of the four selected tree trunks at 1 6 m height we cut off the upper part of the tube to create an open surface and capture any stemflow we connected the tube to a manual rain gauge the entire canopy area of the tree is contributing to the stemflow and thus should be regarded as the funnel area of the rain gauge to compute stemflow we divided the rain gauge funnel area with the canopy surface area that each tree covers finally interception over the area of the canopy can be computed as crockford and richardson 2000 2 i p p t p s where i is interception p is the total rainfall measured by the weather station pt is the throughfall and ps is the stemflow all measurements were averaged over the area covered by the selected trees canopy and expressed in mm throughfall and stemflow were measured after rainfall events a regression equation was computed for the relation between daily rainfall and throughfall for this relation we used only the throughfall data for rainfall events with a maximum 24 h rainfall accumulation based on the tipping bucket rain gauge we examined if the addition of the 12 gauges in january 2016 affected the results by comparing the linear relation between rainfall and the mean throughfall of the 16 gauges and of the 28 gauges the final regression equation was subsequently used to compute the daily throughfall for the water balances see section 2 8 from the observed daily rain 2 7 soil water content we installed eighteen capacitance soil moisture and temperature sensors 5tm decagon devices usa around the four selected trees fig 1 in november 2014 to capture the effects of shading and of the strong north south slope we installed the sensors on the north and south side of the tree trunk we installed the sensors at 12 cm depth at distances of 1 and 2 m from the trees both north and south except for tree tm2 where there was no soil at 2 m south tree tm7 has soil depths greater than 24 cm for over 10 of the total canopy area so one sensor was installed at 30 cm depth 2 m north of tree tm7 the remaining two sensors were installed at 12 cm depth 3 m south of tm2 and 1 m west of tm6 we conducted a two factor analysis of variance anova to test if there is difference in mean soil moisture monthly averages between different trees and between different locations relative to the tree the analysis was done with the ibm spss statistical analysis software the sensors are recording hourly data of volumetric water content and soil temperature c the resolution of these sensors is 0 08 of the volumetric water content the sensors are connected to four em50g wireless cellular data loggers decagon devices usa finally we installed two soil water potential sensors mps 6 decagon devices usa to determine the soil water characteristics these sensors have a resolution of 0 1 kpa 2 8 water balance analysis we applied two areal approaches for computing the water balance components of individual trees using i the canopy projected areas and ii the voronoi polygons fig 3 we refer to those as the canopy and the voronoi approach for both approaches the general form of the tree water balance is 3 δ s p i t s t b e s l where δs is the daily change in soil moisture p is the rainfall i is the interception loss over the canopy l are the losses due to drainage and runoff es is the soil evaporation ts is the tree transpiration sourced from the soil and tb is the tree transpiration sourced from the bedrock all expressed in mm d 1 over the canopy or voronoi area a of each tree for the voronoi area an area weighted total is computed from the water balances of the canopy and the open area see fig 3 parameters s and p are measured i is computed from p section 3 2 l is computed eq 12 es is computed eqs 6 and 7 ts and tb are computed from the sapflow measurements and eqs 9 and 11 respectively we assume that in the soil the net horizontal flow across the boundaries formed either by the voronoi polygons or by the canopy projected area is zero a second assumption is that there is no re infiltration of any surface runoff generated upslope thus losses either enter the bedrock or flow to the stream transpiration from bedrock is defined as the water contained in the bedrock fractures beneath the soil layer that is taken up by the tree roots for transpiration this is an additional input to the water balance thus it is included in the computations we assume that there is no evaporation occurring from the bedrock fractures the water contained in the bedrock fractures is recharged by the drainage losses and depleted by the transpiration from bedrock thus the difference between l and tb indicate the stream flow contribution of the forested areas we applied a depth weighted average approach to compute the soil moisture of the canopy and voronoi areas for trees tm4 tm7 and tm8 which had deeper soils we divided the soil profile into two layers 0 24 cm and 24 49 cm the contributions of the two layers to the water balance are computed according to the percentages of the areas they occupy either for the canopy area or for the voronoi area of the tree a we computed the area weighted soil depth da both for the 0 24 and 24 49 cm depth intervals as 4 d a d i a i a where di is the soil depth measured at each point within the canopy or voronoi area a and ai is the area covered by each soil depth measurement we converted the observed volumetric soil moisture percentage into mm as follows 5 s o d a s θ where so is the observed soil moisture under the tree area for a layer at the respective depth mm and sθ is the average soil moisture percentage of the sensors located within the area the observed soil moisture so was used for the initialization of the water balance equation on the first day of each year after the initialization we applied a stepwise approach for computing each water balance component and the resulting soil moisture sp on a daily basis the computations of the soil evaporation e and the transpiration from the soil ts and transpiration from the bedrock tb were made by combining a daily water balance approach allen et al 1998 with the throughfall sap flow and soil moisture measurements the soil layer in the study area is fully covered by a layer of pine needles that reduces soil evaporation we expressed this reduction with a mulch coefficient km which is applied when rainfall is zero meaning that the pine needle layer is dry and no evaporation is occurring from the mulch itself thus soil evaporation is computed as 6 e s min e t o p t for p t 0 7 e s k m k r e t o for p t 0 where eto is the reference evapotranspiration computed with the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and kr is a soil evaporation reduction coefficient the reason for selecting the equation that gives the minimum value of the soil evaporation is to ensure that soil evaporation is constrained by the potential evaporation and by the rainfall the km was derived by the calibration of the water balance model similar to allen et al 1998 the soil evaporation reduction coefficient is computed as 8 k r s p s ll s ul s ll for s ll s p s ul where sp is the soil moisture predicted by the model sll is the lowest soil moisture level observed during the study period and sul is the soil moisture level at which evaporation starts to become constrained by the available moisture all measured in mm above sul soil evaporation is limited only by energy availability the sll is derived from the soil moisture observations section 3 3 while sul is derived from the calibration of the water balance model the soil evaporation reduction coefficient kr is 1 when the soil moisture is equal or above sul and 0 when the soil moisture reaches the lowest observed value the soil water up take for transpiration ts is computed as 9 t s m i n k s e t o t for s p s wp where ks is the soil transpiration reduction coefficient and t is the areal transpiration computed from the sap flow measurements mm following allen et al 1998 the soil transpiration reduction coefficient is computed as 10 k s s p s wp s ulp s wp for s wp s p s ulp where swp is the soil moisture at wilting point mm and sulp is the soil moisture level where transpiration from the soil starts to become constrained by the available moisture the wilting point was derived from the 30 cm soil moisture sensor section 3 3 while sulp was derived through the calibration of the model any amount of transpiration that is not fulfilled by the soil moisture is taken from the bedrock water 11 t b t t s where tb is transpiration from bedrock mm and the other parameters are as defined above surface runoff and drainage losses l can occur when the field capacity of the soil sfc is exceeded this is computed as 12 l m a x s p s fc 0 for s p s fc we calibrated the water balance model on the tm2 and tm7 trees in 2016 our soil moisture observations showed that even after substantial wetting at high rainfall events the observed soil moisture change was lower than eto therefore we assumed that the reduction in both soil evaporation and transpiration starts at field capacity sul sulp sfc thus the calibrated parameters were sfc and km we evaluated the model performance with the mean absolute error mae the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 we accepted the calibrated model parameters resulting in an mae less than 5 mm nse equal or greater than 0 5 and kge greater than 0 7 for both trees we validated the model for the same trees in 2015 we also computed the model performance criteria for the remaining trees in both years in addition we computed soil evaporation tree transpiration from soil water non water stressed tree transpiration and soil evaporation with the shuttleworth wallace model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 however the shuttleworth walace model requires a large number of parameters that cannot be easily calibrated and that were derived from the literature the applied equations and parameter values are presented in supplementary material 2 finally we computed the water balance components of the 8966 m2 study area referred to as forest stand using the voronoi approach we applied the same methodology as above using the area weighted average sapflow of the monitored trees mm d 1 and the average canopy cover fraction and soil depth of the stand see section 3 1 3 results 3 1 tree biometrics and site characteristics the biometrics of the eight trees that were selected for sap flow measurements their canopy and voronoi areas and soil depths are presented in table 2 eighteen percent of the 540 soil depth observations were less than 5 cm 22 between 10 and 15 cm and 18 had soil depths exceeding 24 cm the average slope of the voronoi areas ranges between 26 degrees tm7 and 32 degrees tm6 the 8 monitored trees were generally representative of the 200 trees in the stand the mean dbh of the 8 trees was 27 7 cm whereas the mean dbh of the 122 trees for which we measured the dbh was 24 7 cm with a minimum of 8 cm and a maximum of 47 cm the average sapwood depth of the 8 trees was 8 6 cm and that of the 45 sampled trees was 7 0 cm the voronoi areas av averaged 39 5 m2 for the 8 trees and 41 3 m2 for the 45 trees with a range of 8 168 m2 for the last 3 2 throughfall and stemflow total rainfall was 507 2 mm in 2015 and 358 8 mm in 2016 we recorded 184 wet days and analyzed 33 events for which throughfall was collected within a consecutive 24 hour rainfall period table 3 eighteen of these events were measured with 16 throughfall gauges while the remaining 15 were measured with 28 throughfall gauges we found only minor differences between the relation for the 16 gauges and the relation for the 28 gauges and high correlation coefficients for both fig 4 using the linear regression equation computed from the mean throughfall of all 33 events pt 0 885 p 0 92 r2 0 99 p 0 00 we found a mean absolute error of 0 7 mm for the 33 observed daily events while the maximum absolute error for a single gauge was 12 9 mm and occurred during the highest recorded 47 2 mm event the total throughfall computed with the regression equation for the 184 wet days was the same as the observed total for the study period 635 mm we captured 51 stemflow events at trees tm2 tm4 tm6 and tm7 during the study period however we excluded it from the water balance computations because the total stemflow was less than 1 of the rainfall over the canopy area 0 2 mm 3 3 soil moisture the average soil moisture content of all 12 cm deep sensors for the studied period 2015 2016 is presented in table 4 average soil moisture contents around the tm2 tm4 and tm6 trees were similar ranging from 14 0 to 14 8 but was slightly lower at the tm7 tree 12 9 the average soil moisture of the 30 cm depth was 18 8 the mean soil moisture at the 17 locations monthly averages was not affected by the sensor location relative to the tree p 0 569 or by the tree p 0 085 random variability was also observed for the sum of the daily negative soil moisture changes made up by evaporation transpiration and drainage for the study period table 4 the sensors with higher average soil moisture generally showed a higher variation during the season however the stoniness of the soil and the highly variable soil depths may be an explanation of the rather random pattern of variability of the observed soil moisture and soil moisture change therefore the average soil moisture content of the 12 cm deep sensors was used to analyse the soil moisture changes of the 0 24 cm soil layer for the water balance computations the lowest observed soil moisture of the top soil sll was 10 following 101 days without rain from 05 jun 2015 to 15 sep 2015 wilting point swp was assumed to be 15 which was the lowest soil moisture observed by the 30 cm soil moisture sensor during this same dry period a water retention curve of the 12 cm soil layer is shown in fig 5 3 4 tree transpiration the average sap velocities and the total volumetric water uptakes of the four trees for the year 2015 and of the eight trees for the year 2016 are presented in table 5 the average sap velocities and the volumetric water uptake were highest in trees tm3 and tm7 tree tm3 is a large tree dbh 36 6 cm canopy area 39 5 m2 whereas tm7 had a dbh below the average for the study site dbh 22 8 cm canopy area 20 1 m2 table 2 however tm3 and tm7 have larger voronoi areas than the other trees meaning less competition for water from other trees and higher radiation load due to the sun exposed canopy tm3 has also a larger canopy area than any other tree the correlations r between the average sap velocities of the eight trees for 2016 the total volumetric sap flow and the biometric parameters are presented in table 6 both the average sap velocity and the total volumetric sap flow had a higher correlation with the voronoi area 0 77 and 0 91 respectively than with any other parameter the highest average monthly sap flow in 2015 occurred in april ranging between 0 032 and 0 078 m3 d 1 for the four trees while in 2016 the highest sap flow was measured in february ranging between 0 008 and 0 083 m3 d 1 for the eight trees the lowest average monthly sap flow in 2015 occurred in september ranging between 0 004 and 0 013 m3 d 1 for the four trees while in 2016 the lowest volumetric water uptake was measured in october ranging between 0 000 and 0 006 m3 d 1 for the eight trees 3 5 water balance using the voronoi approach the model predicted soil moisture of tm2 and tm7 showed a good agreement with the measured soil moisture both in 2015 and 2016 fig 6 the best fit of the observed and predicted soil moisture was with s fc sul and sulp equal to 20 and a km of 0 2 for the calibration period of 2016 the nses were 0 57 tm2 and 0 72 tm7 and the kges were 0 76 tm2 and 0 82 tm7 for the validation 2015 the nses were 0 61 tm2 and 0 60 tm7 and the kges were 0 77 tm2 and 0 78 tm7 the nses of the other two trees in 2015 and the six trees in 2016 ranged between 0 45 tm5 and 0 65 tm8 and the kges ranged between 0 72 tm5 and 0 79 tm4 the mae for all trees and all years ranged between 1 3 and 4 8 mm in both years there was no rainfall between 11 jun and 22 jul the observed soil moisture was below wilting point and the total soil moisture change was 3 mm in 2015 and 1 mm in 2016 whereas the observed transpiration was 28 mm in 2015 and 7 mm in 2016 thus it can be hypothesized that the water needed for the transpiration was provided fully by the bedrock the computed water balance components over the voronoi areas of the four trees tm2 tm4 tm6 and tm7 in 2015 and of all eight trees in 2016 are presented in table 7 rainfall during 2016 was 29 lower than during 2015 whereas the area averaged transpiration of the four trees was 57 lower the sum of the transpiration and soil evaporation exceeded the net rainfall over the area in 2015 only for three of the four trees it is most likely that the high rainfall in fall 2014 191 mm rain during october to december contributed to the recharge of the bedrock fractures the area averaged water balance components of the four trees for 2015 and 2016 and of all trees in 2016 based on both the voronoi and the canopy areas are presented in fig 7 net rainfall and losses were higher for the voronoi approach than for the canopy approach the water balance components showed higher deviations from the average values with the canopy approach than with the voronoi approach also higher variability was observed in 2016 than in 2015 the high negative deviation from the average of the bedrock water uptake and soil transpiration is due to tm5 which is the smallest tree in terms of dbh 13 4 cm and had much lower transpiration rates than the other trees on the contrary the high positive deviation from the average of the bedrock water uptake and soil transpiration is due to the high transpiration of tm3 of the 122 trees in the study area for which dbh was measured 11 had a dbh below 15 cm and 14 had a dbh above 35 cm 3 6 stand water balance during two hydrologically contrasting years the water balance components of the stand in 2015 and 2016 are presented in table 8 as percentages of the rainfall the relative transpiration from the soil decreased during the dry year of 2016 but the relative soil evaporation increased the relative groundwater uptake showed the most significant reduction between the two years from 47 2015 to 21 2016 of the total rainfall although rainfall was lower in 2016 than 2015 soil evaporation was similar quantity wise in both years this leads to a further reduction of the drainage losses thus less water is available in the bedrock fractures resulting in a significant reduction of groundwater uptake the 2016 stand transpiration computed from the eight trees was slightly lower than that of the original four trees 12 transpiration from soil and 24 transpiration from bedrock data not shown transpiration computed with the shuttleworth wallace model without soil moisture constraints was higher than the observed sap flow suggesting that the water in the bedrock was not unlimited supplementary material 2 fig s1 the shuttleworth wallace computed transpiration from the soil was significantly lower than that computed with the water balance model while for the soil evaporation this was the opposite the results indicated that the parameter values related to the soil and canopy resistances may not have represented the study area very well 4 discussion 4 1 methodology for computing the water balance components the methodology we developed for computing the water balance components relies on the accuracy of the measurements throughfall sap flow soil moisture and on the calibrated soil physical properties and mulch coefficient our daily throughfall measurements showed a linear correlation with rainfall even though the deviations from the mean were higher for the higher rainfall events this could be related to the evaporation of splash droplets inside the canopy which have been found to be higher during high rainfall events dunkerley 2009 linearity between rainfall and throughfall was also reported by shachnovich et al 2008 during a three year period in a young pinus halepensis forest in israel the average throughfall we measured for 2015 2016 for the stand was 82 a throughfall of 94 was reported by shachnovich et al 2008 however their exposed land surface over 40 was higher than at our site our numbers fall in line with the review study of llorens and domingo 2007 who found throughfall rates ranging between 70 and 85 for mediterranean pine forests our throughfall rate was also the similar as that of molina and del campo 2012 who found 84 throughfall in a semi arid pinus halepensis forest in valencia spain having a similar tree density 177 trees ha 1 as our study site furthermore low stemflow values 1 4 similar to those we found in our study were reported by shachnovich et al 2008 the sap flow measurements showed that the soil moisture is not enough to cover the trees transpiration needs on the contrary most of the water is taken up from the bedrock fractures a number of field studies including isotope analysis have analysed bedrock water uptake in a jeffrey pine mountain forests in a mediterranean climate in california hubbert et al 2001 rose et al 2003 sternberg et al 1996 witty et al 2003 hubbert et al 2001 found that 70 of the plant available water was contributed by the roots in the weathered bedrock while the remaining 30 was provided by the shallow soil 1 m the trees relied completely on bedrock water in summer witty et al 2003 with water uptake from the weathered bedrock to a depth of at least 3 75 m rose et al 2003 in dry years p 550 mm rainfall is insufficient to replenish water storage deep within the bedrock resulting in lower tree transpiration sternberg et al 1996 the discrepancies between observed and simulated soil moisture are mainly observed in winter 2015 when the observed soil moisture exceeded the field capacity due to continuous rainfall 77 mm in 4 days however the soil moisture in the model cannot exceed the field capacity for some of the smaller rainfall events under dry soil moisture conditions the rain may not have reached the influence of the soil moisture sensors centered at 12 cm depth thus we did not observe any soil moisture change however the model predicts a soil moisture increase because it considers the soil layers as homogenous thus for the first case the predicted soil moisture shows lower values than the measured while for the second case it shows higher values than the measured 4 2 water balances of the two areal approaches the differences between the net rainfall and the losses of the two approaches are because rainfall over the open areas of the voronoi polygons is not intercepted by the tree canopies and because the average soil depth of the voronoi area is generally shallower than that of the canopy covered areas table 2 both the canopy and the voronoi approach indicate that the soil moisture is not enough to cover the transpiration needs of these trees for the canopy projected area the sum of transpiration and soil evaporation exceeded the throughfall for all trees in both years except for tm1 and tm5 in 2016 this causes the trees bedrock water uptake to exceed the surface runoff and drainage losses the results show that trees rely on water resources beyond the canopy area to cover their transpiration needs observations in the study area support these results as roots in exposed soil profiles extended well beyond the canopy area with a maximum observed length of around 10 m in water limited environments where the canopy projected area does not cover the forest floor tree roots may extend into the open areas beyond the canopy crosbie et al 2007 david et al 2004 or rely on groundwater resources david et al 2007 paço et al 2009 to cover the tree s transpiration needs in their study about the root distribution of trees quercus ilex l and herbaceous plants in spain moreno et al 2005 found that the soil surface covered by tree roots can be even seven times higher than the projection of the canopy so that trees can meet their water needs during the dry mediterranean summers as we reported above we were able to observe tree roots extending beyond the canopy projected area up to 10 m from the closest trunk in addition to this in open forests trees receive additional radiation load at the sun exposed sides thus if water is available transpiration per tree could be higher than in dense forests our findings are similar to crosbie et al 2007 who highlighted that in water limited environments total evapotranspiration can exceed rainfall if transpiration is computed over the canopy projected area the higher correlation of the sapflow with voronoi polygons than with any other biometric measurements shows that this approach has the potential to conceptualize the areal transpiration of individual trees in semi arid open forests 4 3 water balances during two hydrologically contrasting years the water balances of the two hydrologically contrasting years showed that soil evaporation was similar quantity wise even though rainfall was 29 lower the impact of the dry year is obvious on the tree transpiration which had a reduction of about 50 similar values of soil evaporation 36 of p and low annual deviations 103 8 mm y 1 were reported also by yaseef et al 2010 in a semi arid pinus halepensis forest according to these authors this is the result of the precipitation pattern which is characterized by small 20 mm but frequent showers which repeatedly wet the topsoil the precipitation pattern and the canopy characteristics in our site are similar to those of yaseef et al 2010 but the only difference is that during the wet year the precipitation was much higher 507 mm versus 285 mm and led to higher transpiration rates 318 mm and 128 mm ungar et al 2013 showed that the annual evapotranspiration over the area of the canopy in a semi arid pinus halepensis forest during two dry years was equal to 107 and 115 of the rainfall in our study site evapotranspiration was equal to 104 of the rainfall during the wet year and 85 during the dry year with the canopy approach however their pinus halepensis forest had a higher tree density 300 trees ha 1 than our site 200 trees ha 1 our surface runoff and drainage losses were 42 of the rainfall during the wet year and 34 during the dry year bellot and chirino 2013 found drainage losses of 23 and less than 1 surface runoff for a pinus halepensis forest sites in spain during a wet year 426 mm rain with soil depths between 0 and 30 cm and slopes between 23 and 26 however the tree density in their study site was between 1280 and 2733 trees ha 1 5 conclusion voronoi polygons were used to compute the water balance components of pinus brutia trees in a semi arid open forest based on sapflow soil moisture and meteorological observations the main conclusions are 1 in semi arid open forests trees extend their roots beyond the canopy projected areas sap flow observations of eight trees indicate that water uptake can exceed the throughfall over the canopy area the total annual sapflow showed a higher correlation with the voronoi area r 0 91 than with any other biometric characteristic voronoi polygons could be a good option for conceptualizing a tree s resource area and for estimating the transpiration of individual trees in water limited single species forests 2 a daily water balance model driven by observed sapflow penman monteith reference evapotranspiration and linear reduction coefficients could capture the water balance of the shallow root zone of a pinus brutia stand reasonably well nse 0 61 kge 0 78 3 water uptake from the bedrock fractures is the most important source of water for the pinus brutia trees allowing the trees to maintain transpiration during the dry june to september months the water uptake by the tree roots causes the depletion of water in the bedrock fractures the observed low transpiration rates between 18 oct 2016 and 31 oct 2016 0 04 mm d 1 on average indicated that the available water in these fractures can be almost completely depleted 4 the two hydrologically contrasting years of 2015 and 2016 revealed the impact of rainfall on the water balance components especially on the transpiration rates of pinus brutia we observed that a 29 decrease in rainfall caused a 57 decrease in transpiration the fraction of rainfall that evaporates from the soil was nearly the same in the two hydrological contrasting years results indicate that prolonged periods of drought may have a severe effect on the pinus brutia transpiration rates a major concern is how trees in water limited environments respond during prolonged dry periods which are expected to increase according to climate projections long term sapflow monitoring studies could provide insights into this furthermore hydrological models should take the trees uptake of water from the bedrock fractures into account as this could be the largest component of the tree transpiration in semi arid environments with shallow soils 6 conflict of interest we have no

7251,pines in semi arid mountain environments manage to survive and thrive despite the limited soil water due to shallow soil depths and overall water scarcity this study aims to develop a method for computing soil evaporation bedrock water uptake and transpiration from a natural open forest based on sap flow heat ratio method soil moisture and meteorological observations the water balance of individual trees was conceptualized with a geometric approach using canopy projected areas and voronoi thiesen polygons the canopy approach assumes that the tree s root area extent is equal to its canopy projected area while the voronoi approach assumes that the tree roots exploit the open area that is closer to the tree than to any other tree the methodology was applied in an open pinus brutia forest 68 canopy cover in cyprus characterized by steep slopes and fractured bedrock during two hydrologically contrasting years 2015 wet 2016 dry sap flow sensors soil moisture sensors throughfall and stemflow gauges were installed on and around eight trees rainfall was 507 mm in 2015 and 359 mm in 2016 according to the canopy approach the sum of tree transpiration and soil evaporation exceeded the throughfall in both years which implies that the trees bedrock water uptake exceeds the surface runoff and drainage losses this indicated that trees extend their roots beyond the canopy projected areas and the use of the voronoi polygons captures this effect according to the stand scale water balance average throughfall during the two years was 81 of the rainfall transpiration was 61 of the rainfall in 2015 but only 32 in 2016 on the contrary the soil evaporation fraction increased from 26 in 2015 to 35 in the dry year of 2016 the contribution of bedrock water to tree transpiration was 77 of rainfall in 2015 and 66 in 2016 during the summer months trees relied 100 on the uptake of water from the fractured bedrock to cover their transpiration needs average monthly transpiration areas ranged between 0 1 mm d 1 in october 2016 and 1 7 mm d 1 in april 2015 this study shows that bedrock uptake could be an essential water balance component of semi arid mountainous pine forests and should be accounted for in hydrologic models keywords pinus brutia semi arid throughfall evapotranspiration sap flow bedrock water uptake 1 introduction mediterranean pines survive in semi arid mountainous areas because of their adaptation to long dry seasons and shallow soil environments chambel et al 2013 climate projections show rising temperatures and declining rainfall trends for the mediterranean region polade et al 2017 in the same context hydrometeorological observations and analyses indicate a continental drying in the past decades which does however contradict with observed trends of continental greening milly and dunne 2016 milly et al 2011 2016 show that the application of potential evapotranspiration models with data from climate models neglects surface energy balances and changes in stomatal control related to increasing co2 rates leading to large biases in hydrologic simulations and the overestimation of evapotranspiration in non water stressed conditions observed trends in the parameters that affect atmospheric evaporative demand also indicate that increases in future potential evapotranspiration may be less severe than projected significant variations in the solar radiation incident at the earth s surface associated with aerosols clouds and aerosol cloud interactions solar dimming have a profound effect on surface albedo and potential evapotranspiration wild 2009 observed trends of increasing atmospheric surface humidity willett et al 2008 and global reductions in wind speeds mcvicar et al 2012 also affect evaporative demand however while future increases in potential evapotranspiration could be less than expected from off line model simulations the impact of these differences may be small in water limited environments mcvicar et al 2012 still the many uncertain changes that face our environment call for an increased understanding of evapotranspiration processes in water limited environments evapotranspiration et is a major unknown variable in the understanding of ecohydrological systems kool et al 2014 globally et is about 67 of the precipitation p zhang et al 2016 while in dry regions it can reach 95 wilcox et al 2003 the different components of et vary per region according to the water and energy availability and the land cover characteristics zhang et al 2016 at a global scale transpiration through the stomata of plants t makes up 65 evaporation from soil es 25 and evaporation of water intercepted by the plant canopy i 10 of the total et zhang et al 2016 the partitioning of et into t es and i is important for hydrologic ecologic forest and agricultural studies balugani et al 2017 guan and wilson 2009 canopy interception is highly heterogeneous in semi arid forests which are frequently characterised by sparse spatial vegetation patterns where trees form vegetated patches that sharply contrast with open areas of bare soil or ephemeral plants domingo et al 1998 shachnovich et al 2008 forest patch characteristics influence throughfall pt and stemflow ps ghimire et al 2012 the mediterranean climate with warm temperatures and high evapotranspiration rates favours interception losses however the occurrence of heavy storms reduces the intercepted fraction bellot et al 1999 dunkerley 2009 rainfall interception has been thoroughly studied in horizontally uniform forests in temperate and tropical climates but fewer studies can be found for dry climates and open forests david et al 2006 dunkerley 2010 hassan et al 2017 llorens and domingo 2007 made an extensive review of rainfall interception by trees and shrubs in mediterranean conditions and concluded that it is highly variable and that more studies should be done on characteristic mediterranean species tree species survive in water limited environments by developing various adaptation mechanisms to access water lubczynski 2009 thus influencing the water balance components of a given locale tree transpiration can be the dominant evapotranspiration component in semi arid areas and can even exceed rainfall in case of groundwater uptake by deep rooted plants zhao et al 2016 schwinning 2010 noted that trees and shrubs take up substantial amounts of water from weathered bedrock after soil water has become unavailable they do so by expanding their root systems in the rock layers below widening fractures by exposing more rock surfaces to solution weathering until water demands are met or water simply runs out schwinning 2010 the quantification of groundwater and bedrock water uptake is especially important in dry environments such as to understand the effect of forests on water resources balugani et al 2017 witty et al 2003 sap flow measurements are widely used for investigating ecohydrological processes and for quantifying transpiration of trees benyon et al 2017 fan et al 2016 reyes acosta and lubczynski 2014 zhao et al 2016 sap flow is influenced by plant physiological characteristics such as stomatal control and tree hydraulic conductance lubczynski 2009 aranda et al 2005 by meteorological factors such as rainfall and droughts shen et al 2015 temperature vapour pressure deficit and net solar radiation huang et al 2011 by the soil properties peng et al 2015 and by geomorphological factors shimizu et al 2015 sap flow observations can provide information about the functional traits of trees the tree to tree variability and the factors that influence this variability thus facilitating the choice of the proper upscaling technique to the entire plot kume et al 2016 2012 pinto et al 2014 the knowledge of the lateral areal extent of the roots of individual trees is important for relating volumetric sapflow measurements to the evaporative demand of the atmosphere and the application of one dimensional evapotranspiration models david et al 2013 pinto et al 2014 the root area of individual trees is often assumed to be equal to the canopy projected area crown reyes acosta and lubczynski 2013 shen et al 2015 wieser et al 2014 however tree roots in semi arid regions generally extend far beyond the projected crown radius wu et al 1985 transpiration in water limited environments would be overestimated if calculated by using the crown projected area and total evapotranspiration would exceed rainfall leading to significant errors in water balance calculations crosbie et al 2007 the areal extent of the roots can be estimated by excavation or root sampling but these techniques do not show information on the active roots walker et al 1989 furthermore such interventions disturb the root zone area may damage and destroy roots and disconnect them from sources of water david et al 2013 thus will affect the sap flow rates of trees crosbie et al 2007 used soil moisture measurements to delineate the area of influence of a tree belt in a 6 m deep soil however these techniques are impossible to apply for roots that grow in rocks as an alternative the areal extent of the roots of the trees is often approximated with the use of geometric methods walker et al 1989 wu et al 1985 in this study we propose a novel approach for the conversion of volumetric sap flow measurements to one dimensional transpiration of individual pine trees with the use of a geometric approach known as voronoi polygons also known as thiessen polygons these polygons divide the forest planar area by allocating it to the nearest tree thiessen polygons have been applied in ecological modelling plant growth and competition studies e g abellanas et al 2016 andrašev et al 2016 burkhart and tomé 2012 gspaltl et al 2012 liao et al 2013 lynch 2015 mcinnis et al 2004 however we have found no studies that used voronoi polygons for the computation of water balance components of individual trees tree competition studies have used and referred to voronoi polygons as area potentially available for a tree burkhart and tomé 2012 voronoi polygons assume that there is a direct linkage between plants performance and the spatial availability of resources berger et al 2008 trees may benefit from areas extending beyond their crowns open areas by receiving more light water and nutrients gspaltl et al 2012 omari et al 2016 mainwaring and maguire 2004 assert that voronoi polygons are a useful surrogate for the degree of root spread and the access to the available belowground resource pool voronoi polygons individual based neighbourhood models are often preferred over cellular automata site based neighbourhood models in ecological studies when there is not sufficient empirical knowledge to formulate empirical rules about tree completion berger et al 2008 schenk and jackson 2002 note that especially in water limited environments the availability of water to plants is highly dependent on their root systems and tree competition the main assumptions of the voronoi approach are that i the voronoi polygon of each tree is not influenced by the roots of neighbouring trees thus all the water resources within a voronoi polygon are taken up by a single tree and ii the area of the voronoi polygon is homogeneous assuming a uniform functioning and extent of the root area in the soil and bedrock thus the applicability of this method is restricted to single species forest stands nevertheless voronoi polygons obey the basic axiom of configuration in plant competition berger et al 2008 these polygons have the potential to represent the below ground plant competition for resources water nutrients but this potential has not been exploited berger et al 2008 czárán 1998 pinus brutia is a light demanding fast growing and drought resistant tree species with a deep rooting system zone which can grow in areas with mean annual rainfall as low as 350 mm boydak 2004 nahal 1983 pinus brutia covers a wide range in the eastern mediterranean from greece to the eastern crimea turkey georgia northern iraq western syria lebanon and cyprus chambel et al 2013 they usually grow in pure stands and they are valuable for their timber products for soil stabilization and wildlife habitats boydak 2004 pinus brutia are systematically close species to the better known pinus halepensis and where they co occur they hybridize frankis 1999 ganopoulos et al 2013 both of these species grow in the mediterranean basin under similar meteorological conditions and have similar radial growth rates liphschitz and mendel 1987 frankis 1999 but pinus brutia is more water demanding and less thermophilic than pinus halepensis chambel et al 2013 there is no scientific literature on pinus brutia transpiration and on their role in the forest water balance in contrast to pinus halepensis which have been studied extensively schiller and cohen 1998 ungar et al 2013 yaseef et al 2010 the specific objectives of this study are i to develop a method for computing soil evaporation bedrock uptake and areal transpiration from an open forest based on sap flow soil moisture and meteorological observations ii to compare the water balances of single pinus brutia trees using either canopy projected areas or voronoi polygons and iii to compute and compare the water balance components of the forest stand during two hydrologically contrasting years 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site characteristics are summarized in table 1 the area has a sloping topography with very shallow soils and fractured bedrock on top of the soil there is a thick layer of litter pine needles that reduces soil evaporation a small number of rockrose bushes cistus sp can be found in the rocky and open areas of the forest that are not shaded by the canopies of the pinus brutia trees fig 1 our observations in the study area found that the root areas of the trees have horizontal extents up to 10 m and that roots are commonly present in bedrock fractures supplementary material 1 it is a water limited environment and on average 53 of the rain falls between december and february while 4 falls between july and september camera et al 2014 water is only found in the top 30 m of the fractured bedrock and well yields are less than 1 m3 h 1 personal communication geological survey department of cyprus no baseflow was observed in the small ephemeral stream approximately 100 m downslope north of the study site s fence during the study period 2 2 pinus brutia biometrics we measured the diameter at breast height dbh of 122 trees more than half the number of the trees inside the study area during september and october 2014 we extracted small core samples from 45 trees using an increment borer 5 15 mm diameter to measure the sapwood depth we applied indicator dye methyl orange and methyl blue and determined the sapwood depth from the difference in colour between the sapwood and the heartwood area eight trees were selected for further monitoring we selected four trees with a dbh below the average dbh of the 122 trees 25 cm and four trees with a dbh above the average dbh referred to as tm1 tm2 tm3 tm4 and tm5 tm6 tm7 tm8 respectively fig 2 we measured the length of the longest branches in the eight cardinal and inter cardinal directions for each selected tree we estimated the canopy projected area of the eight trees with the triangulation method in arcgis 2 3 site characterization we used an electronic theodolite with a distance meter total station and a differential gps to create a high resolution 5 m digital elevation model dem of the western part of the 8966 m2 fenced study area with the same methods we recorded the exact location of the trees fig 1 after processing the dem in arcgis we created a slope map of the area burrough and mcdonnell 1998 jones 1998 we also used a measuring tape and a compass to define the canopy covered areas and the open areas we created a 1 m square grid around each of the eight selected trees and we measured the soil depth at each grid point a total of 540 points with the use of a metal stick utility probe hammer and measuring tape voronoi polygons were created with the triangulation method in arcgis 2 4 meteorological data monitoring meteorological data from an automatic station located on an open area at the upslope end of the study site fig 1 were provided by the department of forests rainfall is measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge with 0 1 mm resolution at 1 m height above ground surface air temperature and relative air humidity are measured at 2 m height solar radiation is measured by a pyranometer w m 2 wind speed and direction are measured at 10 m height 2 5 sap flow we used four sap flow heat ratio method hrm instruments burgess and downey 2014 to determine sap flow rates of the tm2 tm4 tm6 and tm7 trees for the period from 01 jan 2015 to 31 dec 2016 we installed four additional sap flow instruments on trees tm1 tm3 tm5 and tm8 for the period from 20 oct 2015 to 31 dec 2016 these instruments have a resolution of 0 01 cm h 1 and have the capacity to measure reverse sap flow rates as well burgess and downey 2014 we installed one sensor at 1 3 m height facing north in all trees for the long term sap flow measurements azimuthal sapflow measurements eliades et al in review showed that the sap velocity of the north facing sensors was on average 1 lower than the average sap velocity of all four azimuth sensors for trees tm1 tm2 tm3 and tm4 july august 2017 and 3 7 lower than the south facing sensor for trees tm6 and tm7 december 2014 august 2015 the hrm consists of a set of two measurement needles downstream and upstream and one central needle heater that releases a heat pulse the two measurement needles have thermistors positioned exactly at 7 5 mm and 22 5 mm from the tip of the measurement needles the hrm determines the increase in temperature at these two points after the release of the heat pulse we inserted the three needles radially into the xylem tissue of the bark at the breast height of the trees we used a drill guide with three holes spaced 5 mm apart to minimize needle misalignment during insertion the instrument was set up to send a pulse every 60 min the heat pulse velocity vh cm h 1 was calculated according to burgess et al 2001 as follows 1 v h k x ln v 1 v 2 3600 where k is the thermal diffusivity of the fresh wood cm2 s 1 x is the distance between the heater and the measurement needles 0 5 cm and v1 and v2 are the differences between the initial temperature c at the two thermocouples downstream and upstream flow of the heater respectively and the temperature measured after a heat pulse was released the diffusivity k was computed after determining the thermal properties of wood the thermal diffusivity was determined according to the procedures of vandegehuchte and steppe 2012 the installation procedure computations and corrections for natural thermal gradients ntg wound and misalignment of the needles were conducted according to burgess et al 1998 2001 and vandegehuchte et al 2015 the sap velocity vs was then calculated according to burgess et al 2001 with the use of the sap flow tool software burgess and downey 2014 for the conversion of sap velocity to sap flow we multiplied the sap velocity vs with the corresponding cross sectional area of the sapwood ax we applied linear regressions between sap flow sensors to fill in any missing hourly data the missing hourly data ranged from 1 tm3 to 14 tm4 and sap flow sensors showed high linear correlations r 0 91 0 98 according to cohen et al 2008 in pinus halepensis trees in a semi arid area sap velocities are highest near the cambium and decrease with distance from the cambium furthermore liphschitz and mendel 1987 showed that pinus halepensis and pinus brutia have similar radial growth responses so we assumed that the decrease of the sap velocity in relation to the distance from the cambium is similar in both species heat field deformation measurements hfd8 100 ict international on tree tm1 between november 2015 and april 2016 and on four more trees within the study site march april 2018 confirmed the linear decrease of sap velocity with sapwood depth thus we computed the sap velocity beyond the last thermistor by applying a linear decrease function in all hrm sensors the hfd instrument measures sap flux densities at 1 cm intervals at eight sapwood depths 2 9 cm and computations were conducted according to nadezhdina et al 1998 finally we computed a correlation matrix between average sap velocities total sap flow and biometric parameters stem sapwood canopy projected and voronoi areas 2 6 rainfall partitioning sixteen manual rain gauges climemet with a funnel diameter of 10 cm and two storing and measuring cylinders an inner one with a 25 mm capacity and an outer one with a 225 mm capacity were placed randomly under the trees canopies to measure throughfall fig 1 after rainfall events exceeding 25 mm the inner cylinder reaches its maximum capacity and the additional water is stored in the outer tube we conducted a one way analysis of variance anova to test the hypothesis that all sixteen gauges receive the same throughfall fraction the analysis was done with the ibm spss statistical analysis software twelve additional manual rain gauges were placed under the trees canopies in january 2016 for stemflow we installed a flexible pvc tube with silicon glue around each of the four selected tree trunks at 1 6 m height we cut off the upper part of the tube to create an open surface and capture any stemflow we connected the tube to a manual rain gauge the entire canopy area of the tree is contributing to the stemflow and thus should be regarded as the funnel area of the rain gauge to compute stemflow we divided the rain gauge funnel area with the canopy surface area that each tree covers finally interception over the area of the canopy can be computed as crockford and richardson 2000 2 i p p t p s where i is interception p is the total rainfall measured by the weather station pt is the throughfall and ps is the stemflow all measurements were averaged over the area covered by the selected trees canopy and expressed in mm throughfall and stemflow were measured after rainfall events a regression equation was computed for the relation between daily rainfall and throughfall for this relation we used only the throughfall data for rainfall events with a maximum 24 h rainfall accumulation based on the tipping bucket rain gauge we examined if the addition of the 12 gauges in january 2016 affected the results by comparing the linear relation between rainfall and the mean throughfall of the 16 gauges and of the 28 gauges the final regression equation was subsequently used to compute the daily throughfall for the water balances see section 2 8 from the observed daily rain 2 7 soil water content we installed eighteen capacitance soil moisture and temperature sensors 5tm decagon devices usa around the four selected trees fig 1 in november 2014 to capture the effects of shading and of the strong north south slope we installed the sensors on the north and south side of the tree trunk we installed the sensors at 12 cm depth at distances of 1 and 2 m from the trees both north and south except for tree tm2 where there was no soil at 2 m south tree tm7 has soil depths greater than 24 cm for over 10 of the total canopy area so one sensor was installed at 30 cm depth 2 m north of tree tm7 the remaining two sensors were installed at 12 cm depth 3 m south of tm2 and 1 m west of tm6 we conducted a two factor analysis of variance anova to test if there is difference in mean soil moisture monthly averages between different trees and between different locations relative to the tree the analysis was done with the ibm spss statistical analysis software the sensors are recording hourly data of volumetric water content and soil temperature c the resolution of these sensors is 0 08 of the volumetric water content the sensors are connected to four em50g wireless cellular data loggers decagon devices usa finally we installed two soil water potential sensors mps 6 decagon devices usa to determine the soil water characteristics these sensors have a resolution of 0 1 kpa 2 8 water balance analysis we applied two areal approaches for computing the water balance components of individual trees using i the canopy projected areas and ii the voronoi polygons fig 3 we refer to those as the canopy and the voronoi approach for both approaches the general form of the tree water balance is 3 δ s p i t s t b e s l where δs is the daily change in soil moisture p is the rainfall i is the interception loss over the canopy l are the losses due to drainage and runoff es is the soil evaporation ts is the tree transpiration sourced from the soil and tb is the tree transpiration sourced from the bedrock all expressed in mm d 1 over the canopy or voronoi area a of each tree for the voronoi area an area weighted total is computed from the water balances of the canopy and the open area see fig 3 parameters s and p are measured i is computed from p section 3 2 l is computed eq 12 es is computed eqs 6 and 7 ts and tb are computed from the sapflow measurements and eqs 9 and 11 respectively we assume that in the soil the net horizontal flow across the boundaries formed either by the voronoi polygons or by the canopy projected area is zero a second assumption is that there is no re infiltration of any surface runoff generated upslope thus losses either enter the bedrock or flow to the stream transpiration from bedrock is defined as the water contained in the bedrock fractures beneath the soil layer that is taken up by the tree roots for transpiration this is an additional input to the water balance thus it is included in the computations we assume that there is no evaporation occurring from the bedrock fractures the water contained in the bedrock fractures is recharged by the drainage losses and depleted by the transpiration from bedrock thus the difference between l and tb indicate the stream flow contribution of the forested areas we applied a depth weighted average approach to compute the soil moisture of the canopy and voronoi areas for trees tm4 tm7 and tm8 which had deeper soils we divided the soil profile into two layers 0 24 cm and 24 49 cm the contributions of the two layers to the water balance are computed according to the percentages of the areas they occupy either for the canopy area or for the voronoi area of the tree a we computed the area weighted soil depth da both for the 0 24 and 24 49 cm depth intervals as 4 d a d i a i a where di is the soil depth measured at each point within the canopy or voronoi area a and ai is the area covered by each soil depth measurement we converted the observed volumetric soil moisture percentage into mm as follows 5 s o d a s θ where so is the observed soil moisture under the tree area for a layer at the respective depth mm and sθ is the average soil moisture percentage of the sensors located within the area the observed soil moisture so was used for the initialization of the water balance equation on the first day of each year after the initialization we applied a stepwise approach for computing each water balance component and the resulting soil moisture sp on a daily basis the computations of the soil evaporation e and the transpiration from the soil ts and transpiration from the bedrock tb were made by combining a daily water balance approach allen et al 1998 with the throughfall sap flow and soil moisture measurements the soil layer in the study area is fully covered by a layer of pine needles that reduces soil evaporation we expressed this reduction with a mulch coefficient km which is applied when rainfall is zero meaning that the pine needle layer is dry and no evaporation is occurring from the mulch itself thus soil evaporation is computed as 6 e s min e t o p t for p t 0 7 e s k m k r e t o for p t 0 where eto is the reference evapotranspiration computed with the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and kr is a soil evaporation reduction coefficient the reason for selecting the equation that gives the minimum value of the soil evaporation is to ensure that soil evaporation is constrained by the potential evaporation and by the rainfall the km was derived by the calibration of the water balance model similar to allen et al 1998 the soil evaporation reduction coefficient is computed as 8 k r s p s ll s ul s ll for s ll s p s ul where sp is the soil moisture predicted by the model sll is the lowest soil moisture level observed during the study period and sul is the soil moisture level at which evaporation starts to become constrained by the available moisture all measured in mm above sul soil evaporation is limited only by energy availability the sll is derived from the soil moisture observations section 3 3 while sul is derived from the calibration of the water balance model the soil evaporation reduction coefficient kr is 1 when the soil moisture is equal or above sul and 0 when the soil moisture reaches the lowest observed value the soil water up take for transpiration ts is computed as 9 t s m i n k s e t o t for s p s wp where ks is the soil transpiration reduction coefficient and t is the areal transpiration computed from the sap flow measurements mm following allen et al 1998 the soil transpiration reduction coefficient is computed as 10 k s s p s wp s ulp s wp for s wp s p s ulp where swp is the soil moisture at wilting point mm and sulp is the soil moisture level where transpiration from the soil starts to become constrained by the available moisture the wilting point was derived from the 30 cm soil moisture sensor section 3 3 while sulp was derived through the calibration of the model any amount of transpiration that is not fulfilled by the soil moisture is taken from the bedrock water 11 t b t t s where tb is transpiration from bedrock mm and the other parameters are as defined above surface runoff and drainage losses l can occur when the field capacity of the soil sfc is exceeded this is computed as 12 l m a x s p s fc 0 for s p s fc we calibrated the water balance model on the tm2 and tm7 trees in 2016 our soil moisture observations showed that even after substantial wetting at high rainfall events the observed soil moisture change was lower than eto therefore we assumed that the reduction in both soil evaporation and transpiration starts at field capacity sul sulp sfc thus the calibrated parameters were sfc and km we evaluated the model performance with the mean absolute error mae the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 we accepted the calibrated model parameters resulting in an mae less than 5 mm nse equal or greater than 0 5 and kge greater than 0 7 for both trees we validated the model for the same trees in 2015 we also computed the model performance criteria for the remaining trees in both years in addition we computed soil evaporation tree transpiration from soil water non water stressed tree transpiration and soil evaporation with the shuttleworth wallace model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 however the shuttleworth walace model requires a large number of parameters that cannot be easily calibrated and that were derived from the literature the applied equations and parameter values are presented in supplementary material 2 finally we computed the water balance components of the 8966 m2 study area referred to as forest stand using the voronoi approach we applied the same methodology as above using the area weighted average sapflow of the monitored trees mm d 1 and the average canopy cover fraction and soil depth of the stand see section 3 1 3 results 3 1 tree biometrics and site characteristics the biometrics of the eight trees that were selected for sap flow measurements their canopy and voronoi areas and soil depths are presented in table 2 eighteen percent of the 540 soil depth observations were less than 5 cm 22 between 10 and 15 cm and 18 had soil depths exceeding 24 cm the average slope of the voronoi areas ranges between 26 degrees tm7 and 32 degrees tm6 the 8 monitored trees were generally representative of the 200 trees in the stand the mean dbh of the 8 trees was 27 7 cm whereas the mean dbh of the 122 trees for which we measured the dbh was 24 7 cm with a minimum of 8 cm and a maximum of 47 cm the average sapwood depth of the 8 trees was 8 6 cm and that of the 45 sampled trees was 7 0 cm the voronoi areas av averaged 39 5 m2 for the 8 trees and 41 3 m2 for the 45 trees with a range of 8 168 m2 for the last 3 2 throughfall and stemflow total rainfall was 507 2 mm in 2015 and 358 8 mm in 2016 we recorded 184 wet days and analyzed 33 events for which throughfall was collected within a consecutive 24 hour rainfall period table 3 eighteen of these events were measured with 16 throughfall gauges while the remaining 15 were measured with 28 throughfall gauges we found only minor differences between the relation for the 16 gauges and the relation for the 28 gauges and high correlation coefficients for both fig 4 using the linear regression equation computed from the mean throughfall of all 33 events pt 0 885 p 0 92 r2 0 99 p 0 00 we found a mean absolute error of 0 7 mm for the 33 observed daily events while the maximum absolute error for a single gauge was 12 9 mm and occurred during the highest recorded 47 2 mm event the total throughfall computed with the regression equation for the 184 wet days was the same as the observed total for the study period 635 mm we captured 51 stemflow events at trees tm2 tm4 tm6 and tm7 during the study period however we excluded it from the water balance computations because the total stemflow was less than 1 of the rainfall over the canopy area 0 2 mm 3 3 soil moisture the average soil moisture content of all 12 cm deep sensors for the studied period 2015 2016 is presented in table 4 average soil moisture contents around the tm2 tm4 and tm6 trees were similar ranging from 14 0 to 14 8 but was slightly lower at the tm7 tree 12 9 the average soil moisture of the 30 cm depth was 18 8 the mean soil moisture at the 17 locations monthly averages was not affected by the sensor location relative to the tree p 0 569 or by the tree p 0 085 random variability was also observed for the sum of the daily negative soil moisture changes made up by evaporation transpiration and drainage for the study period table 4 the sensors with higher average soil moisture generally showed a higher variation during the season however the stoniness of the soil and the highly variable soil depths may be an explanation of the rather random pattern of variability of the observed soil moisture and soil moisture change therefore the average soil moisture content of the 12 cm deep sensors was used to analyse the soil moisture changes of the 0 24 cm soil layer for the water balance computations the lowest observed soil moisture of the top soil sll was 10 following 101 days without rain from 05 jun 2015 to 15 sep 2015 wilting point swp was assumed to be 15 which was the lowest soil moisture observed by the 30 cm soil moisture sensor during this same dry period a water retention curve of the 12 cm soil layer is shown in fig 5 3 4 tree transpiration the average sap velocities and the total volumetric water uptakes of the four trees for the year 2015 and of the eight trees for the year 2016 are presented in table 5 the average sap velocities and the volumetric water uptake were highest in trees tm3 and tm7 tree tm3 is a large tree dbh 36 6 cm canopy area 39 5 m2 whereas tm7 had a dbh below the average for the study site dbh 22 8 cm canopy area 20 1 m2 table 2 however tm3 and tm7 have larger voronoi areas than the other trees meaning less competition for water from other trees and higher radiation load due to the sun exposed canopy tm3 has also a larger canopy area than any other tree the correlations r between the average sap velocities of the eight trees for 2016 the total volumetric sap flow and the biometric parameters are presented in table 6 both the average sap velocity and the total volumetric sap flow had a higher correlation with the voronoi area 0 77 and 0 91 respectively than with any other parameter the highest average monthly sap flow in 2015 occurred in april ranging between 0 032 and 0 078 m3 d 1 for the four trees while in 2016 the highest sap flow was measured in february ranging between 0 008 and 0 083 m3 d 1 for the eight trees the lowest average monthly sap flow in 2015 occurred in september ranging between 0 004 and 0 013 m3 d 1 for the four trees while in 2016 the lowest volumetric water uptake was measured in october ranging between 0 000 and 0 006 m3 d 1 for the eight trees 3 5 water balance using the voronoi approach the model predicted soil moisture of tm2 and tm7 showed a good agreement with the measured soil moisture both in 2015 and 2016 fig 6 the best fit of the observed and predicted soil moisture was with s fc sul and sulp equal to 20 and a km of 0 2 for the calibration period of 2016 the nses were 0 57 tm2 and 0 72 tm7 and the kges were 0 76 tm2 and 0 82 tm7 for the validation 2015 the nses were 0 61 tm2 and 0 60 tm7 and the kges were 0 77 tm2 and 0 78 tm7 the nses of the other two trees in 2015 and the six trees in 2016 ranged between 0 45 tm5 and 0 65 tm8 and the kges ranged between 0 72 tm5 and 0 79 tm4 the mae for all trees and all years ranged between 1 3 and 4 8 mm in both years there was no rainfall between 11 jun and 22 jul the observed soil moisture was below wilting point and the total soil moisture change was 3 mm in 2015 and 1 mm in 2016 whereas the observed transpiration was 28 mm in 2015 and 7 mm in 2016 thus it can be hypothesized that the water needed for the transpiration was provided fully by the bedrock the computed water balance components over the voronoi areas of the four trees tm2 tm4 tm6 and tm7 in 2015 and of all eight trees in 2016 are presented in table 7 rainfall during 2016 was 29 lower than during 2015 whereas the area averaged transpiration of the four trees was 57 lower the sum of the transpiration and soil evaporation exceeded the net rainfall over the area in 2015 only for three of the four trees it is most likely that the high rainfall in fall 2014 191 mm rain during october to december contributed to the recharge of the bedrock fractures the area averaged water balance components of the four trees for 2015 and 2016 and of all trees in 2016 based on both the voronoi and the canopy areas are presented in fig 7 net rainfall and losses were higher for the voronoi approach than for the canopy approach the water balance components showed higher deviations from the average values with the canopy approach than with the voronoi approach also higher variability was observed in 2016 than in 2015 the high negative deviation from the average of the bedrock water uptake and soil transpiration is due to tm5 which is the smallest tree in terms of dbh 13 4 cm and had much lower transpiration rates than the other trees on the contrary the high positive deviation from the average of the bedrock water uptake and soil transpiration is due to the high transpiration of tm3 of the 122 trees in the study area for which dbh was measured 11 had a dbh below 15 cm and 14 had a dbh above 35 cm 3 6 stand water balance during two hydrologically contrasting years the water balance components of the stand in 2015 and 2016 are presented in table 8 as percentages of the rainfall the relative transpiration from the soil decreased during the dry year of 2016 but the relative soil evaporation increased the relative groundwater uptake showed the most significant reduction between the two years from 47 2015 to 21 2016 of the total rainfall although rainfall was lower in 2016 than 2015 soil evaporation was similar quantity wise in both years this leads to a further reduction of the drainage losses thus less water is available in the bedrock fractures resulting in a significant reduction of groundwater uptake the 2016 stand transpiration computed from the eight trees was slightly lower than that of the original four trees 12 transpiration from soil and 24 transpiration from bedrock data not shown transpiration computed with the shuttleworth wallace model without soil moisture constraints was higher than the observed sap flow suggesting that the water in the bedrock was not unlimited supplementary material 2 fig s1 the shuttleworth wallace computed transpiration from the soil was significantly lower than that computed with the water balance model while for the soil evaporation this was the opposite the results indicated that the parameter values related to the soil and canopy resistances may not have represented the study area very well 4 discussion 4 1 methodology for computing the water balance components the methodology we developed for computing the water balance components relies on the accuracy of the measurements throughfall sap flow soil moisture and on the calibrated soil physical properties and mulch coefficient our daily throughfall measurements showed a linear correlation with rainfall even though the deviations from the mean were higher for the higher rainfall events this could be related to the evaporation of splash droplets inside the canopy which have been found to be higher during high rainfall events dunkerley 2009 linearity between rainfall and throughfall was also reported by shachnovich et al 2008 during a three year period in a young pinus halepensis forest in israel the average throughfall we measured for 2015 2016 for the stand was 82 a throughfall of 94 was reported by shachnovich et al 2008 however their exposed land surface over 40 was higher than at our site our numbers fall in line with the review study of llorens and domingo 2007 who found throughfall rates ranging between 70 and 85 for mediterranean pine forests our throughfall rate was also the similar as that of molina and del campo 2012 who found 84 throughfall in a semi arid pinus halepensis forest in valencia spain having a similar tree density 177 trees ha 1 as our study site furthermore low stemflow values 1 4 similar to those we found in our study were reported by shachnovich et al 2008 the sap flow measurements showed that the soil moisture is not enough to cover the trees transpiration needs on the contrary most of the water is taken up from the bedrock fractures a number of field studies including isotope analysis have analysed bedrock water uptake in a jeffrey pine mountain forests in a mediterranean climate in california hubbert et al 2001 rose et al 2003 sternberg et al 1996 witty et al 2003 hubbert et al 2001 found that 70 of the plant available water was contributed by the roots in the weathered bedrock while the remaining 30 was provided by the shallow soil 1 m the trees relied completely on bedrock water in summer witty et al 2003 with water uptake from the weathered bedrock to a depth of at least 3 75 m rose et al 2003 in dry years p 550 mm rainfall is insufficient to replenish water storage deep within the bedrock resulting in lower tree transpiration sternberg et al 1996 the discrepancies between observed and simulated soil moisture are mainly observed in winter 2015 when the observed soil moisture exceeded the field capacity due to continuous rainfall 77 mm in 4 days however the soil moisture in the model cannot exceed the field capacity for some of the smaller rainfall events under dry soil moisture conditions the rain may not have reached the influence of the soil moisture sensors centered at 12 cm depth thus we did not observe any soil moisture change however the model predicts a soil moisture increase because it considers the soil layers as homogenous thus for the first case the predicted soil moisture shows lower values than the measured while for the second case it shows higher values than the measured 4 2 water balances of the two areal approaches the differences between the net rainfall and the losses of the two approaches are because rainfall over the open areas of the voronoi polygons is not intercepted by the tree canopies and because the average soil depth of the voronoi area is generally shallower than that of the canopy covered areas table 2 both the canopy and the voronoi approach indicate that the soil moisture is not enough to cover the transpiration needs of these trees for the canopy projected area the sum of transpiration and soil evaporation exceeded the throughfall for all trees in both years except for tm1 and tm5 in 2016 this causes the trees bedrock water uptake to exceed the surface runoff and drainage losses the results show that trees rely on water resources beyond the canopy area to cover their transpiration needs observations in the study area support these results as roots in exposed soil profiles extended well beyond the canopy area with a maximum observed length of around 10 m in water limited environments where the canopy projected area does not cover the forest floor tree roots may extend into the open areas beyond the canopy crosbie et al 2007 david et al 2004 or rely on groundwater resources david et al 2007 paço et al 2009 to cover the tree s transpiration needs in their study about the root distribution of trees quercus ilex l and herbaceous plants in spain moreno et al 2005 found that the soil surface covered by tree roots can be even seven times higher than the projection of the canopy so that trees can meet their water needs during the dry mediterranean summers as we reported above we were able to observe tree roots extending beyond the canopy projected area up to 10 m from the closest trunk in addition to this in open forests trees receive additional radiation load at the sun exposed sides thus if water is available transpiration per tree could be higher than in dense forests our findings are similar to crosbie et al 2007 who highlighted that in water limited environments total evapotranspiration can exceed rainfall if transpiration is computed over the canopy projected area the higher correlation of the sapflow with voronoi polygons than with any other biometric measurements shows that this approach has the potential to conceptualize the areal transpiration of individual trees in semi arid open forests 4 3 water balances during two hydrologically contrasting years the water balances of the two hydrologically contrasting years showed that soil evaporation was similar quantity wise even though rainfall was 29 lower the impact of the dry year is obvious on the tree transpiration which had a reduction of about 50 similar values of soil evaporation 36 of p and low annual deviations 103 8 mm y 1 were reported also by yaseef et al 2010 in a semi arid pinus halepensis forest according to these authors this is the result of the precipitation pattern which is characterized by small 20 mm but frequent showers which repeatedly wet the topsoil the precipitation pattern and the canopy characteristics in our site are similar to those of yaseef et al 2010 but the only difference is that during the wet year the precipitation was much higher 507 mm versus 285 mm and led to higher transpiration rates 318 mm and 128 mm ungar et al 2013 showed that the annual evapotranspiration over the area of the canopy in a semi arid pinus halepensis forest during two dry years was equal to 107 and 115 of the rainfall in our study site evapotranspiration was equal to 104 of the rainfall during the wet year and 85 during the dry year with the canopy approach however their pinus halepensis forest had a higher tree density 300 trees ha 1 than our site 200 trees ha 1 our surface runoff and drainage losses were 42 of the rainfall during the wet year and 34 during the dry year bellot and chirino 2013 found drainage losses of 23 and less than 1 surface runoff for a pinus halepensis forest sites in spain during a wet year 426 mm rain with soil depths between 0 and 30 cm and slopes between 23 and 26 however the tree density in their study site was between 1280 and 2733 trees ha 1 5 conclusion voronoi polygons were used to compute the water balance components of pinus brutia trees in a semi arid open forest based on sapflow soil moisture and meteorological observations the main conclusions are 1 in semi arid open forests trees extend their roots beyond the canopy projected areas sap flow observations of eight trees indicate that water uptake can exceed the throughfall over the canopy area the total annual sapflow showed a higher correlation with the voronoi area r 0 91 than with any other biometric characteristic voronoi polygons could be a good option for conceptualizing a tree s resource area and for estimating the transpiration of individual trees in water limited single species forests 2 a daily water balance model driven by observed sapflow penman monteith reference evapotranspiration and linear reduction coefficients could capture the water balance of the shallow root zone of a pinus brutia stand reasonably well nse 0 61 kge 0 78 3 water uptake from the bedrock fractures is the most important source of water for the pinus brutia trees allowing the trees to maintain transpiration during the dry june to september months the water uptake by the tree roots causes the depletion of water in the bedrock fractures the observed low transpiration rates between 18 oct 2016 and 31 oct 2016 0 04 mm d 1 on average indicated that the available water in these fractures can be almost completely depleted 4 the two hydrologically contrasting years of 2015 and 2016 revealed the impact of rainfall on the water balance components especially on the transpiration rates of pinus brutia we observed that a 29 decrease in rainfall caused a 57 decrease in transpiration the fraction of rainfall that evaporates from the soil was nearly the same in the two hydrological contrasting years results indicate that prolonged periods of drought may have a severe effect on the pinus brutia transpiration rates a major concern is how trees in water limited environments respond during prolonged dry periods which are expected to increase according to climate projections long term sapflow monitoring studies could provide insights into this furthermore hydrological models should take the trees uptake of water from the bedrock fractures into account as this could be the largest component of the tree transpiration in semi arid environments with shallow soils 6 conflict of interest we have no

7252,fluid flow through highly porous media is important in a variety of science and technology fields including hydrology chemical engineering convections in porous media and others while many methods have been available to measure the permeability of tight solid materials such as concrete and rock the technique for measuring the permeability of highly porous media is limited such as gravel aggregated soils and crushed rock this study proposes a new simplified method for measuring the permeability of highly porous media with a permeability of 10 8 10 4 m2 using a venturi tube to gauge the gas flowing rate through the sample using crushed rocks and glass beads as the test media we measure the permeability and inertial resistance factor of six types of single size aggregate columns we compare the testing results with the published permeability and inertial resistance factor of crushed rock and of glass beads we found that in a log log graph the permeability and inertial resistance factor of a single size aggregate heap increases linearly with the mean diameter of the aggregate we speculate that the proposed simplified method is suitable to efficiently test the

durability of these media and the flowing rate through them permeability through porous media thus has been gaining increasing research momentum recently permeability of shale and other tight rock reservoirs has recently provoked a great deal of research foci because permeability is a critical parameter in the exploitations of the natural gas stored in the shale reservoir permeability of such tight materials is primarily influenced by the characteristic parameters of porous media including porosity tortuosity klinkenberg gas slippage factor and the gas adsorption desorption on the pore wall civan 2010 javadpour et al 2007 sakhaee pour and bryant 2012 the permeability of shale or other comparably tight porous media ranges from 10 10 10 18 m2 permeability of these tight porous media can be tested by a pulse decay apparatus in which transducers are used to measure the pressure difference across the sample and the permeability can be found from the plot of pressure difference against time bourbie and walls 1982 feng et al 2017 jones 1997 lasseux et al 2011 tinni et al 2012 the permeability of tight porous media can be also acquired by addressing the analytical solution of the diffusivity equation for pulse decay experiments cui et al 2009 kazemi and takbiri borujeni 2015 details about techniques for measuring the gas permeability of tight reservoirs can be referred to tidwell 2006 in analogy to tight rock the permeability of dense concrete is also one of the fundamental properties determining the durability of concrete structure the permeability of dense concrete is also tested by the pulse decay method cabrera and lynsdale 1988 figg 1973 torrent 1992 this method cannot be adapted to measure the permeability of a highly porous media with a permeability k 10 8 10 4 m2 because the pressure difference across a highly permeable medium decays too rapidly to be measured reasonably the permeability of a highly porous medium is usually tested by the use of a head constant method that is a steady gas flowing rate through a highly permeable sample is measured under the condition that the pressure difference across the sample is maintained constant astm d2434 2006 qin et al 2016 for instance the astm d2434 is proposed to determine the water permeability through granular soils in the range of laminar flow astm d2434 2006 for high permeability media such as pervious permeable concrete samples their permeability can be tested by constant head method montes and haselbach 2006 qin et al 2015 however the testing fluid passing through both granular soil and pervious concrete is water rather than gas and it is unknown if the measured permeabilities of a highly porous medium are equal for water and gas furthermore unlike the water which can be gauged by weight gas draining from a porous medium tends to escape making the permeability measurement difficult gas flow through highly porous media is fundamental for a variety of science and technology fields including soil respiration morgenroth 2011 volder et al 2009 chemical engineering mandal 2015 mandal et al 2013 convections in porous media nield and bean 1992 sun et al 2007 and many others levintal et al 2017 crushed rock layer in cold regions has incited a great deal of research activities in the last decades because the convective cooling through the layer s cavities has been through as the main reason that preserves permafrost ground cool air drops into the crushed rock s cavity and warm air at the bottom floats up due to buoyant flow while the reversing circulation vanishes a thermal diode effect that keeps the soils under a crushed rock layer cool cheng et al 2007 goering 2003 lai et al 2006 the permeability of a crushed rock layer is the crucial factor influencing the advection of the air through the internal cavities zhang et al 2013 measured the permeability and inertial resistance factor of crushed rock layers with different aggregate sizes in a wind tunnel and found that the permeability and inertial resistance factor of single size crushed rock column with mean diameter of 0 09 0 26 m are about 0 42 2 65 10 5 m2 and 38 57 82 25 m 1 respectively however testing the permeability in a wind tunnel is time consuming and costly necessitating a new efficient method to measure the permeability of porous media here we propose a new simplified method for measuring the permeability characteristics of porous media i e permeability and inertial resistance factor using a venturi tube to gauge the gas flowing rate the testing instrument is designed such that both the permeability and the inertial resistance factor can be tested even when the pressure gradient across the sample is as small as 10 100 pa m using this method we test the permeability and inertial resistance factor of six types of single size aggregate columns whose diameters are slightly lower than the aggregate diameter used in zhang et al 2013 we compare the testing results in this study with the studies of zhang et al 2013 in order to find the correlation between the permeability or inertial resistance factor and the mean aggregate size of the tested porous media 2 theory for measuring the permeability of a porous layer a new simplified method is proposed for measuring the permeability of porous materials that have an intrinsic permeability about 10 8 10 4 m2 the testing instrument is shown in fig 1 the air first passes through the highly porous media column which is supported by a highly permeable steel mesh the passing air is then routed via a venturi tube in which the air flow is gauged in the venturi tube the air flow in the narrow section is greater than that in the expanding section resulting in a pressure difference between the two sections when the veturi tube is filled with liquid such as water the difference of the liquid heads in the veturi tube indicates the pressure difference between the narrow and expanding sections which is 1 p e p n ρ l gh where p pa is static pressure ρ kg m3 is density g m s2 is the acceleration due to gravity and h m is the water head difference and subscripts of e n and l stand for the expanding section the narrow section and the liquid in the tube respectively according to the law of conservation of mass we have 2 u e u n a n a e where a m2 is cross sectional area u m s is fluid flow velocity at a point on a streamline according to the bernoulli s principle we have 3 p e ρ g u e 2 2 p n ρ g u n 2 2 where the subscript g stands for gas solving for u e one gets 4 u e c 2 ρ l gh ρ g a e a n 2 1 where c is the coefficient of the longitudinal friction loss coefficient because of the gas contraction at the narrow section at the venturi tube katz 2010 in addition to the gas flowing rate through the highly porous media we must get the pressure differential across the sample to get this difference we use a vacuum to create a negative air pressure in the outlet due to this vacuum the air pressure below the sample is lower than the outside atmospheric air pressure but the difference might be too small to be measured in a simple precise manner to magnify this difference the cylinder filled with the highly porous sample is tightly connected to an upside down truncated cone to taper the air flowing cross sectional area to a smaller cylinder fig 1 the air passing the smaller cylinder is finally routed to the venturi tube just below the top of the smaller cylinder a glass tube is tilted into a tank filled with liquid the negative air pressure in the slant tube will suck up the liquid in the tank to a certain height h m so the air pressure in the small cylinder right at the bottom of the cone pb pa is 5 p b p 0 ρ l gh in eq 5 the water height h is 6 h h cos θ where h m is the water head reading from the slant graduated glass tube and θ rad is the slant angle of the tube it should be noted that θ depends on testing media if the porous media is highly permeable the pressure gradient across the aggregate column is small so that the slant angle θ must be sufficient small to make h in the graduated glass tube being read reasonably in the upside down truncated cone according to the bernoulli s principle we have 7 p b ρ g u b 2 2 p f p t ρ g u t 2 2 where subscript of b and t stand for the bottom and top of the cone respectively pf pa is the pressure loss caused by a gradual cross sectional area change of the gas flow details for the calculation of pf can be found in appendix a in eq 7 one can find the pressure differential across the porous media as 8 δ p p 0 p t ρ l gh p f ρ g u t 2 u b 2 2 the gas flow rate must support a measurable head difference in the glass tube inserted slantly into the water tank and must support a readable liquid head difference in the veturi tube in this case the gas permeability and the pressure gradient correlate as indicated in eq 9 9 δ p l μ g k u ρ g b u 2 where l m is the length of the highly porous medium sample k m2 and b m 1 are the permeability and inertial resistance factor of the testing sample respectively u m s is the nominal velocity of the gas passing through the sample 10 u a e a u e a e a t u e where a m2 is the cross sectional area of the porous medium column which is the same as the area at the top surface of the upside down truncated cone at 3 experiments we used crushed rock aggregates and glass beads as highly porous media to test the permeability and inertial resistance factor of highly porous media with different particle sizes we sorted the crushed limestone aggregates for three single size aggregate heaps the first 31 5 36 5 mm retaining by the 31 5 mm sieve but passing the 36 5 mm sieve the second the 25 4 31 5 mm and the third the 12 7 25 4 mm this aggregate range was a coarse estimation and the true gradation of a specific single size aggregate heap was further analyzed by image processing in the analysis for each aggregate size range we took a representative packed aggregate and arranged it on a black sheet such that each single aggregate was separated fig 2 we took the image of the aggregate group and analyze its size the true gradation of three aggregate heaps was plotted in fig 3 in which the mean particle diameters of the three aggregate heaps were d50 15 0 d50 24 4 d50 36 5 mm respectively in comparison we also test three aggregate columns of glass beads with uniform particle size in each column the particle sizes of glass beads are 14 mm 25 mm and 35 mm respectively fig 4 the permeability and inertial resistance factor of these six aggregate columns were then tested respectively the cylinder fig 1 housed for a column had a diameter of 0 35 m a 0 1257 m2 and a length of l 0 40 m the bottom of the upside down truncated cone had an across sectional area of ab 1 52 10 3 m2 the diameter of expanding and narrow cross sections of the venturi tube were 5 0 and 2 5 cm respectively ae 1 96 10 3 m2 an 4 91 10 4 m2 the angle between the cone s generatrix line and the cone s axis is 0 187π both the liquid in the veturi tube and in the tank were water to better view the water head difference in the tubes red ink drops were added to the water to make it looked red we first used a vacuum to create a negative air pressure of approximately 0 5 atm and we found the water difference in the tube inserted vertically in the tank was about 2 cm which was too small to be read in high precision we leant down the graduated glass tube into the water tank such that the slope of the tube was about 1 10 cosθ 1 10 we tested the nominal gas velocity passing through a specific aggregate column under different water heads in the graduated glass tube for each test we read the water heads in the veturi tube and in the tube inserted in the tank simultaneously by taking a snapshot that includes both tubes the image was then analyzed by an image processing software to take the water heads the gas flowing rate in the aggregate column was maintained at a level lower 0 2 m s in order to reduce the influence of the frictional loss on the experimental data in each test the aggregate was dried in outdoor air such that there was not visual moisture on the surface of the aggregates the aggregate was then packed and vibrated in the column showed in fig 1 experiments were performed in outdoor environment in summer where the mean air temperature was about 33 c μg 1 86 10 5n s m2 ρg 1 165 kg m3 4 results and discussion the average gas flowing rate through the aggregate column increases with the pressure gradient as indicated in fig 5 details about the calculations of the pressure gradient and the velocity can be referred to appendix b the pressure gradient increases nonlinearly with the average velocity while the used particle sizes are greatly different the nonlinearity of the pressure loss versus the velocity is similar deviating from the linearity as predicted by darcy s law the gas permeability of these aggregate columns should be estimated by using the quadratic forchheimer equation as indicated in eq 9 using eq 9 we estimate the permeability k and inertial resistance factor b of three single size aggregate columns as tabulated in table 1 the regression for the quadratic forchheimer equation is greater than 0 929 with a better confidence with for the columns with smaller particle size the k and b values of the aggregate heap increase with the aggregate size a finding that is similar as zhang et al 2013 and kundu et al 2016 for comparison we plot the permeability against the mean diameter of the aggregate in fig 6 zhang et al 2013 and kundu et al 2016 also studied the permeability of dry highly porous media so their data are presented for comparison the porous medium studied in zhang et al is crushed limestone which is similar as the crushed rock used in this study although the difference of aggregate mining source results in varying mineral components we found that in a log log graph k and b values in this study and in zhang et al 2013 increase linearly with the mean diameter of the aggregate the red straight line in fig 6 the porous columns used in kundu et al 2016 are packed uniform size spherical glass beads whose particles are smaller than the glass beads used in this study in log log plots the k values of the spherical glass beads studied by kundu et al 2016 of the glass beads in this article and of the spherical concrete ball in zhang et al 2013 increase linearly with the aggregate size this finding is also coincident with kenney et al 1984 in which the k value of an aggregate heap with grain size from about 0 01 5 mm increases with d5 subscript 5 stands for 5 mass of smaller particles in fig 7 it is found that the inertial resistance factor b of an aggregate heap column decreases linearly with the increase of the particle size therefore we conclude that in a log log scale the b values of porous media decreases linearly with the diameter of the aggregate in addition to the particle size the shapes of the aggregates influence the permeability too the permeability of packed spherical aggregates is greater than that of crushed rock heap in case that both aggregates are the same size fig 6 this is expected because compared to crushed rocks spherical aggregates have smoother surfaces so they exhibit less frictional loss along the passing flow as the particle size enlarges the specific area of a crushed rock aggregate would be close that of a spherical aggregate with the same diameter as a result the k and b values of the glass beads and of the crushed rocks are close as the aggregate size enlarges fig 6 and fig 7 the k and b versus the aggregate diameter in fig 6 and fig 7 may be available for dry single size aggregate heaps only for an aggregate heap with other gradations its k and b values could differ greatly than those found in this study as indicated in fig 6 when both heaps of aggregates with the same diameter the single size crushed rock heap has lower permeability than the glass bead heap as the particles of the crushed rock heap are not ideally uniform small particles can fill the pore between large ones reducing the heap s porosity and thus its permeability in addition k and b values of a wet aggregate heap may differ from those of the same heap at dry therefore porosity density and moisture influence k and b values too these influences merit further investigations although the objective of this study is to present a new simplified method 5 conclusions we propose a new simplified method to measure the permeability and inertial resistance factor of highly porous media with an intrinsic permeability of 10 8 10 4 m2 using a veturi tube to gauge the gas flowing through the porous media and using a slant graduated glass tube to gauge the pressure differential across the testing media using this method we test the permeability and inertial resistance factor of six aggregate columns with different particle sizes it is found that the permeability of single size crushed rock heaps is about 1 50e 7 3 15e 7 and 4 95e 7 for the aggregate heaps with mean particle diameters of 15 0 24 4 and 36 5 mm respectively and for uniform size glass beads the gas permeability is 3 96e 7 7 91e 7 and 13 81e 7 for beads with uniform size of 14 mm 25 mm and 35 mm respectively we compared this permeability data with the data studied by zhang et al 2013 and by kundu et al 2016 and found that in a log log graph the permeability of a single size aggregate heap increases linearly with the mean aggregate diameter the permeability of a heap consisting of spherical units such as glass bead is greater than that of a crushed rock aggregate heap with the same particle size it is also found that the inertial resistance factor b of an aggregate heap column decreases linearly with the increase of the aggregate size a heap of spherical aggregates has less inertial resistance factor than a crushed rock heap because the latter has a greater specific surface area while only glass beads and crushed rock are tested in this study we speculate that the proposed new simplified method is suitable to test the

that both the permeability and the inertial resistance factor can be tested even when the pressure gradient across the sample is as small as 10 100 pa m using this method we test the permeability and inertial resistance factor of six types of single size aggregate columns whose diameters are slightly lower than the aggregate diameter used in zhang et al 2013 we compare the testing results in this study with the studies of zhang et al 2013 in order to find the correlation between the permeability or inertial resistance factor and the mean aggregate size of the tested porous media 2 theory for measuring the permeability of a porous layer a new simplified method is proposed for measuring the permeability of porous materials that have an intrinsic permeability about 10 8 10 4 m2 the testing instrument is shown in fig 1 the air first passes through the highly porous media column which is supported by a highly permeable steel mesh the passing air is then routed via a venturi tube in which the air flow is gauged in the venturi tube the air flow in the narrow section is greater than that in the expanding section resulting in a pressure difference between the two sections when the veturi tube is filled with liquid such as water the difference of the liquid heads in the veturi tube indicates the pressure difference between the narrow and expanding sections which is 1 p e p n ρ l gh where p pa is static pressure ρ kg m3 is density g m s2 is the acceleration due to gravity and h m is the water head difference and subscripts of e n and l stand for the expanding section the narrow section and the liquid in the tube respectively according to the law of conservation of mass we have 2 u e u n a n a e where a m2 is cross sectional area u m s is fluid flow velocity at a point on a streamline according to the bernoulli s principle we have 3 p e ρ g u e 2 2 p n ρ g u n 2 2 where the subscript g stands for gas solving for u e one gets 4 u e c 2 ρ l gh ρ g a e a n 2 1 where c is the coefficient of the longitudinal friction loss coefficient because of the gas contraction at the narrow section at the venturi tube katz 2010 in addition to the gas flowing rate through the highly porous media we must get the pressure differential across the sample to get this difference we use a vacuum to create a negative air pressure in the outlet due to this vacuum the air pressure below the sample is lower than the outside atmospheric air pressure but the difference might be too small to be measured in a simple precise manner to magnify this difference the cylinder filled with the highly porous sample is tightly connected to an upside down truncated cone to taper the air flowing cross sectional area to a smaller cylinder fig 1 the air passing the smaller cylinder is finally routed to the venturi tube just below the top of the smaller cylinder a glass tube is tilted into a tank filled with liquid the negative air pressure in the slant tube will suck up the liquid in the tank to a certain height h m so the air pressure in the small cylinder right at the bottom of the cone pb pa is 5 p b p 0 ρ l gh in eq 5 the water height h is 6 h h cos θ where h m is the water head reading from the slant graduated glass tube and θ rad is the slant angle of the tube it should be noted that θ depends on testing media if the porous media is highly permeable the pressure gradient across the aggregate column is small so that the slant angle θ must be sufficient small to make h in the graduated glass tube being read reasonably in the upside down truncated cone according to the bernoulli s principle we have 7 p b ρ g u b 2 2 p f p t ρ g u t 2 2 where subscript of b and t stand for the bottom and top of the cone respectively pf pa is the pressure loss caused by a gradual cross sectional area change of the gas flow details for the calculation of pf can be found in appendix a in eq 7 one can find the pressure differential across the porous media as 8 δ p p 0 p t ρ l gh p f ρ g u t 2 u b 2 2 the gas flow rate must support a measurable head difference in the glass tube inserted slantly into the water tank and must support a readable liquid head difference in the veturi tube in this case the gas permeability and the pressure gradient correlate as indicated in eq 9 9 δ p l μ g k u ρ g b u 2 where l m is the length of the highly porous medium sample k m2 and b m 1 are the permeability and inertial resistance factor of the testing sample respectively u m s is the nominal velocity of the gas passing through the sample 10 u a e a u e a e a t u e where a m2 is the cross sectional area of the porous medium column which is the same as the area at the top surface of the upside down truncated cone at 3 experiments we used crushed rock aggregates and glass beads as highly porous media to test the permeability and inertial resistance factor of highly porous media with different particle sizes we sorted the crushed limestone aggregates for three single size aggregate heaps the first 31 5 36 5 mm retaining by the 31 5 mm sieve but passing the 36 5 mm sieve the second the 25 4 31 5 mm and the third the 12 7 25 4 mm this aggregate range was a coarse estimation and the true gradation of a specific single size aggregate heap was further analyzed by image processing in the analysis for each aggregate size range we took a representative packed aggregate and arranged it on a black sheet such that each single aggregate was separated fig 2 we took the image of the aggregate group and analyze its size the true gradation of three aggregate heaps was plotted in fig 3 in which the mean particle diameters of the three aggregate heaps were d50 15 0 d50 24 4 d50 36 5 mm respectively in comparison we also test three aggregate columns of glass beads with uniform particle size in each column the particle sizes of glass beads are 14 mm 25 mm and 35 mm respectively fig 4 the permeability and inertial resistance factor of these six aggregate columns were then tested respectively the cylinder fig 1 housed for a column had a diameter of 0 35 m a 0 1257 m2 and a length of l 0 40 m the bottom of the upside down truncated cone had an across sectional area of ab 1 52 10 3 m2 the diameter of expanding and narrow cross sections of the venturi tube were 5 0 and 2 5 cm respectively ae 1 96 10 3 m2 an 4 91 10 4 m2 the angle between the cone s generatrix line and the cone s axis is 0 187π both the liquid in the veturi tube and in the tank were water to better view the water head difference in the tubes red ink drops were added to the water to make it looked red we first used a vacuum to create a negative air pressure of approximately 0 5 atm and we found the water difference in the tube inserted vertically in the tank was about 2 cm which was too small to be read in high precision we leant down the graduated glass tube into the water tank such that the slope of the tube was about 1 10 cosθ 1 10 we tested the nominal gas velocity passing through a specific aggregate column under different water heads in the graduated glass tube for each test we read the water heads in the veturi tube and in the tube inserted in the tank simultaneously by taking a snapshot that includes both tubes the image was then analyzed by an image processing software to take the water heads the gas flowing rate in the aggregate column was maintained at a level lower 0 2 m s in order to reduce the influence of the frictional loss on the experimental data in each test the aggregate was dried in outdoor air such that there was not visual moisture on the surface of the aggregates the aggregate was then packed and vibrated in the column showed in fig 1 experiments were performed in outdoor environment in summer where the mean air temperature was about 33 c μg 1 86 10 5n s m2 ρg 1 165 kg m3 4 results and discussion the average gas flowing rate through the aggregate column increases with the pressure gradient as indicated in fig 5 details about the calculations of the pressure gradient and the velocity can be referred to appendix b the pressure gradient increases nonlinearly with the average velocity while the used particle sizes are greatly different the nonlinearity of the pressure loss versus the velocity is similar deviating from the linearity as predicted by darcy s law the gas permeability of these aggregate columns should be estimated by using the quadratic forchheimer equation as indicated in eq 9 using eq 9 we estimate the permeability k and inertial resistance factor b of three single size aggregate columns as tabulated in table 1 the regression for the quadratic forchheimer equation is greater than 0 929 with a better confidence with for the columns with smaller particle size the k and b values of the aggregate heap increase with the aggregate size a finding that is similar as zhang et al 2013 and kundu et al 2016 for comparison we plot the permeability against the mean diameter of the aggregate in fig 6 zhang et al 2013 and kundu et al 2016 also studied the permeability of dry highly porous media so their data are presented for comparison the porous medium studied in zhang et al is crushed limestone which is similar as the crushed rock used in this study although the difference of aggregate mining source results in varying mineral components we found that in a log log graph k and b values in this study and in zhang et al 2013 increase linearly with the mean diameter of the aggregate the red straight line in fig 6 the porous columns used in kundu et al 2016 are packed uniform size spherical glass beads whose particles are smaller than the glass beads used in this study in log log plots the k values of the spherical glass beads studied by kundu et al 2016 of the glass beads in this article and of the spherical concrete ball in zhang et al 2013 increase linearly with the aggregate size this finding is also coincident with kenney et al 1984 in which the k value of an aggregate heap with grain size from about 0 01 5 mm increases with d5 subscript 5 stands for 5 mass of smaller particles in fig 7 it is found that the inertial resistance factor b of an aggregate heap column decreases linearly with the increase of the particle size therefore we conclude that in a log log scale the b values of porous media decreases linearly with the diameter of the aggregate in addition to the particle size the shapes of the aggregates influence the permeability too the permeability of packed spherical aggregates is greater than that of crushed rock heap in case that both aggregates are the same size fig 6 this is expected because compared to crushed rocks spherical aggregates have smoother surfaces so they exhibit less frictional loss along the passing flow as the particle size enlarges the specific area of a crushed rock aggregate would be close that of a spherical aggregate with the same diameter as a result the k and b values of the glass beads and of the crushed rocks are close as the aggregate size enlarges fig 6 and fig 7 the k and b versus the aggregate diameter in fig 6 and fig 7 may be available for dry single size aggregate heaps only for an aggregate heap with other gradations its k and b values could differ greatly than those found in this study as indicated in fig 6 when both heaps of aggregates with the same diameter the single size crushed rock heap has lower permeability than the glass bead heap as the particles of the crushed rock heap are not ideally uniform small particles can fill the pore between large ones reducing the heap s porosity and thus its permeability in addition k and b values of a wet aggregate heap may differ from those of the same heap at dry therefore porosity density and moisture influence k and b values too these influences merit further investigations although the objective of this study is to present a new simplified method 5 conclusions we propose a new simplified method to measure the permeability and inertial resistance factor of highly porous media with an intrinsic permeability of 10 8 10 4 m2 using a veturi tube to gauge the gas flowing through the porous media and using a slant graduated glass tube to gauge the pressure differential across the testing media using this method we test the permeability and inertial resistance factor of six aggregate columns with different particle sizes it is found that the permeability of single size crushed rock heaps is about 1 50e 7 3 15e 7 and 4 95e 7 for the aggregate heaps with mean particle diameters of 15 0 24 4 and 36 5 mm respectively and for uniform size glass beads the gas permeability is 3 96e 7 7 91e 7 and 13 81e 7 for beads with uniform size of 14 mm 25 mm and 35 mm respectively we compared this permeability data with the data studied by zhang et al 2013 and by kundu et al 2016 and found that in a log log graph the permeability of a single size aggregate heap increases linearly with the mean aggregate diameter the permeability of a heap consisting of spherical units such as glass bead is greater than that of a crushed rock aggregate heap with the same particle size it is also found that the inertial resistance factor b of an aggregate heap column decreases linearly with the increase of the aggregate size a heap of spherical aggregates has less inertial resistance factor than a crushed rock heap because the latter has a greater specific surface area while only glass beads and crushed rock are tested in this study we speculate that the proposed new simplified method is suitable to test the

7253,under ice discharge is estimated using open water reference hydrographs however the ratings for ice affected sites are generally qualified as poor the u s geological survey usgs in collaboration with the colorado water conservation board conducted a proof of concept to develop an alternative method for computing under ice discharge using hydroacoustics and the probability concept the study site was located south of minturn colorado co usa and was selected because of 1 its proximity to the existing usgs streamgage 09064600 eagle river near minturn co and 2 its ease of access to verify discharge using a variety of conventional methods from late september 2014 to early march 2015 hydraulic conditions varied from open water to under ice these temporal changes led to variations in water depth and velocity hydroacoustics tethered and uplooking acoustic doppler current profilers and acoustic doppler velocimeters were deployed to measure the vertical velocity profile at a singularly important vertical of the channel cross section because the velocity profile was non standard and cannot be characterized using a power law or log law velocity data were analyzed using the probability concept which is a probabilistic formulation of the velocity distribution the probability concept derived discharge was compared to conventional methods including stage discharge and index velocity ratings and concurrent field measurements each is complicated by the dynamics of ice formation pressure influences on stage measurements and variations in cross sectional area due to ice formation no particular discharge method was assigned as truth rather one statistical metric kolmogorov smirnov ks agreement plots and concurrent measurements provided a measure of comparability between various methods regardless of the method employed comparisons between each method revealed encouraging results depending on the flow conditions and the absence or presence of ice cover for example during lower discharges dominated by under ice and transition intermittent open water and under ice conditions the ks metric suggests there is not sufficient information to reject the null hypothesis and implies that the probability concept and index velocity rating represent similar distributions during high flow open water conditions the comparisons are less definitive therefore it is important that the appropriate analytical method and instrumentation be selected six conventional discharge measurements were collected concurrently with probability concept derived discharges with percent differences of 9 0 21 8 6 17 8 3 6 and 2 3 this proof of concept demonstrates that riverine discharges can be computed using the probability concept for a range of hydraulic extremes variations in discharge open water and under ice conditions immediately after the siting phase is complete which typically requires one day computing real time discharges is particularly important at sites where 1 new streamgages are planned 2 river hydraulics are complex and 3 shifts in the stage discharge rating are needed to correct the streamflow record use of the probability concept does not preclude the need to maintain a stage area relation both the probability concept and index velocity rating offer water resource managers and decision makers alternatives for computing real time discharge for open water and under ice conditions keywords under ice discharge hydroacoustics probability concept streamflow information entropy 1 introduction ice formation alters the stage discharge rating at more than 50 percent of the natural rivers where continuous record streamgages are maintained by the u s geological survey usgs melcher and walker 1992 additionally most stations operated by the water survey of canada wsc are subject to ice affected discharge during the winter months wiebe et al 1989 field methods to measure daily under ice discharge rantz et al 1982 terzi 1981 are established by the usgs and wsc however the methods are time consuming costly and may place hydrographers at risk for safety this proof of concept demonstrates that instantaneous discharges unit values can be computed using the probability concept chiu 1987 for a range of hydraulic extremes in open water and under ice conditions dominated by variations in discharge and stage the ability of the probability concept to compute discharge for a range of conditions is particularly important at ungaged sites at new streamgage locations or at hydraulically complex sites where shifts and corrections are necessary however like the index velocity method a stage area relation must be maintained the probability concept offers water resource managers and decision makers an alternative method for measuring real time streamflow without the need to develop and maintain a stage discharge rating 2 purpose characterizing under ice discharge is important particularly in high elevation and high latitude rivers where the winter record is a significant component of the annual water balance the usgs in collaboration with the colorado water conservation board cwcb conducted a proof of concept to develop an alternative method for measuring under ice discharge the goals were to develop a method that 1 applies to streamgages that are new or lack historical data and 2 computes under ice discharge regardless of the hydraulic condition at the time when the instrumentation is sited and deployed 3 previous studies methods for directly measuring or indirectly computing under ice discharge have been proposed by a number of investigators these include field and computational studies 3 1 field studies generally under ice discharges are computed using the midsection or velocity area method which requires depth averaged velocities and cross sectional channel subareas because of the boundary created by ice cover the velocity distribution is non standard one cannot be characterized using a log law or power law and the location of the maximum instream velocity umax can occur at various distances h below the ice cover as a function of discharge throughout the ice affected period it is recommended that two vertical velocity profiles be collected with each ice measurement to determine the coefficient needed to convert the 0 2d 0 8d or 0 6d velocities to a mean vertical velocity generally the average of the velocities obtained by the 0 2d 0 8d method produces a mean velocity but a coefficient of 0 92 is needed for velocities obtained by the 0 6d method where d actual flow depth from the bottom of the ice cover to the streambed turnipseed and sauer 2010 rantz et al 1982 terzi 1981 the usgs and wsc validated the methods used for measuring under ice discharges by initiating independent and coordinated programs and collecting vertical velocity profiles walker and wang 1997 during the winter from 1988 to 1989 the usgs made 115 measurements consisting of 2300 vertical velocity profiles during the winter from 1989 to 1991 the wsc made 83 measurements resulting in 1800 individual vertical velocity profiles the data were compiled to create a database containing hydraulic variables for 4100 under ice profiles in general an adjustment coefficient of 0 88 is used to translate the 0 5d point velocity to a mean vertical velocity for a given vertical however in most instances this coefficient is less than the measured mean vertical velocity reported by walker and wang 1997 which is summarized in their table 2 because the median adjustment coefficients differs from the generally accepted value of 0 88 use of a single value introduces a systematic bias crance and frothingham 2008 suggest that the vertical velocity distribution varies as the roughness of the ice cover changes with an increase in the ice cover roughness the relative position of umax and the mean vertical velocities are different and they tend to migrate closer to the streambed when the ice cover roughness increases additionally vertically averaged velocities tend to be greater than those predicted using the 0 6d and 0 2d 0 8d methods with the recommended value of 0 92 for the 0 6d method they suggest a coefficient of 0 75 be used healy and hicks 2004 and clow and fleming 2008 directly measured under ice discharge healy and hicks 2004 relied on index velocity methods and examined data for eight hydrometric stations the results suggest the existence of a unique relation between the index velocity and the mean channel velocity the consistency of the location of umax and the velocity panel was not strongly correlated to the quality of the index velocity relationship clow and fleming 2008 deployed an automated dye dilution gaging system to measure discharge in ice affected streams rhodamine wt was injected into the stream at a constant rate and downstream concentrations were measured with a submersible fluorometer data loggers were programed to control system operations monitor key variables and perform discharge computations on the basis of dye dilution a comparison of discharge from the tracer gage and from a cipoletti weir during periods of extensive ice cover resulted in a root mean square error rmse of the tracer gage equal to 0 029 cubic meters per second m3 s or 6 3 percent of the mean discharge for the study period 3 2 computational studies lau 1981 meyer 2009 and sui et al 2010 developed equations for characterizing the velocity distribution for under ice conditions lau 1981 proposed a κ ε kinetic energy and rate of dissipation turbulence model with varying top under ice and bottom channel bottom boundary roughness and suggested that the mean vertical velocity based on the 0 2d 0 8d point velocities approximates the mean vertical velocity for a given vertical however examination of the velocity data shows that the profiles deviate from the standard logarithmic distribution for more than 40 percent of the flow depth in contrast the correction coefficient for translating the 0 6d velocity to a mean vertical velocity is 5 percent different from the referenced value of 0 88 meyer 2009 modified the logarithmic tachoida for ice cover by assuming the velocity profile consists of two water layers whereas sui et al 2010 reported the depth averaged velocity for open water was greater than that for ice cover dominated by smooth or rough conditions additionally the depth averaged velocity under smooth ice cover was similar to rough ice cover 4 study site the study site is collocated with usgs streamgage 09064600 eagle river near minturn colorado usa fig 1 latitude 39 554368 longitude 106 402223 north american datum 1983 approximately 4 0 km km southeast of minturn colorado and approximately 183 m m upstream from the highway 24 bridge over the eagle river fig 2 the site was selected because of 1 its proximity to the existing usgs streamgage with an historical record and 2 its ease of access to verify discharge the headwaters of the eagle river originate in the white river national forest and drain northwest towards the site which is located in a high mountain environment elevation approximately 2466 m m the

radar that operates at 34 7 ghz ghz and measures the surface water velocity by computing a shift in the transmitted and received frequencies doppler shift the unit is not capable of measuring stage and does not include an intrinsic algorithm for computing discharge however because of its portability is used to identify the location of the y axis the vertical in the channel cross section that contains umax which was based on the maximum surface water velocity ud to complement the svr a flowtracker and streampro were used to characterize the vertical velocity distribution at various depths at the y axis the flowtracker is a hydroacoustic velocimeter that functions on a wading rod and measures water velocities using 10 mhz mhz sound bursts the streampro is a 2 0 mhz tadcp that is generally tethered from bank to bank and provides a measure of the cross sectional area and velocity and computes discharge it is capable of measuring channels ranging in depth from 10 cm to 7 m deep sontek 2016 the iq plus is an uadcp and the components are entirely self contained in the transducer head assembly the iq plus relies on an external power supply and includes an internal 4 gb data recorder the transducer head uses four 3 0 mhz acoustic beams to measure velocity there is one vertical beam and an integrated pressure sensor to measure stream depth above the unit the iq plus utilizes a thermistor to measure water temperature compensates for speed of sound corrections and is capable of monitoring 100 depth cells with a profiling range of 0 06 to 4 88 m depth and velocity

stand alone unit comprising two components an independent transducer head and separate electronics housing that incorporates a 4 mb data recorder and internal power supply the transducer head uses three 2 4 mhz acoustic beams to measure velocity and one vertical acoustic beam to measure stream depth above the unit the v adcp uses a thermistor to measure water temperature to correct for the speed of sound in water and is capable of measuring from 3 to 150 depth cells with a profiling range of 0 18 to 4 88 m and can be configured using bb talk software data recorded by the unit must be downloaded to a laptop for post processing as previously stated the v adcp operates at 2 4 mhz whereas the iq plus operates at 3 0 mhz although no specific measures were taken to examine acoustic interferences between the units no suspicious data were observed that indicated substantive acoustic noise 5 2 deployment mounting the adcps so that the instruments occupied the same vertical in the transect yet allow leveling to minimize pitch and roll errors was a challenge a mounting bracket was designed using 1 9 cm diameter rigid electrical conduit 90 degree offset pipe rail fittings and electrical conduit strut fig 3 the mount incorporated two of the 90 degree offset fittings on each end allowing for complete pitch and roll adjustments after the mount was secured to two semi vertical lengths of conduit driven into the streambed using a slide hammer this design facilitated easy removal using a t post puller or high lift jack to extract the vertical pipes and mount from the streambed 5 3 communications a sutron satlink 2 data logger goes satellite transmitter was installed to telemeter data from the iq plus the iq plus is sdi 12 serial digital interface at 1200 baud accessed at http sdi 12 org specification php compliant which allows seamless integration of different data loggers capable of polling sdi 12 sensors the data logger was configured to poll specific parameters of interest the v adcp does not have an sdi 12 output option so telemetering would require more equipment than the scope of this project intended data from the v adcp unit were periodically downloaded manually velocity data recorded by the v adcp were not available for the entire deployment period because of configuration needs under ice water depths approached the operating limits of the unit as it was configured at installation data from the iq plus data were available for the entire study period and were periodically downloaded in the field and analyzed in the office select parameters were telemetered via the sutron satlink2 data logger goes transmitter velocities were sampled for two minutes and measurements made every 15 min unit values of the signal to noise ratio which is a measure of acoustic data quality ϕ ratio of mean channel velocity uavg and umax temperature and depth are illustrated in fig 4 as a b c and d respectively 5 4 y axis the location of the y axis was initially determined during the site visit on 07 22 14 using velocity and depth data acquired from a flowtracker and stationary moving bed analyses smba mueller et al 2013 and svr lee and julien 2006 suggest that modeling the location of umax is significant when establishing stage discharge relations it is also important when defining the relation between surface water velocities and the mean channel velocity chiu and tung 2002 and fulton and ostrowski 2008 suggest umax coincides with ud to confirm this contention point velocities along the y axis were measured immediately below the water surface to the channel bottom using a flowtracker at intervals that adequately defined the velocity distribution depending on water depth this should include a minimum of 6 point velocities near surface 0 2d 0 4d 0 6d 0 8d close to the channel bottom or greater the procedure was repeated at prescribed distances to the left and right of the y axis which was verified to be at latitude 39 554181 longitude 106 402155 on four separate occasions 07 22 14 09 22 14 02 04 15 and 03 13 15 during low and high streamflow events and during open water and under ice conditions these results suggest the location of the y axis at minturn is stable and does not vary with stage velocity or discharge after establishing the y axis location two uadcps iq plus serial number iq1317014 and v adcp serial number 61211 were installed near the channel bottom and oriented vertically to measure umax in accordance with the computational tenets prescribed by the probability concept and index velocity method below 6 computational methods methods for computing open water and under ice discharge levesque and oberg 2012 turnipseed and sauer 2010 rantz et al 1982 buchanan and somers 1969 include conventional methods stage discharge ratings index velocity ratings and the probability concept chiu 1987 all measurements are obtained using a current meter flowtracker or streampro or uadcp 6 1 conventional methods conventional open water and under ice discharge measurements were collected to maintain the stage discharge rating and facilitate winter estimates at the usgs streamgage 09064600 eagle river near minturn co table 1 an index velocity rating was established using three open water and two under ice discharge measurements and velocity data from the iq plus and streampro had the deployment period spanned several years developing one rating for open water and one for under ice conditions would be justified given the short duration of this proof of concept a sufficient number of extreme flow events could not be measured that would fully characterize streamflow conditions at the site both ratings were used to verify the probability concept derived discharges for water years wy 2014 2015 10 01 13 through 09 30 15 as with any research available funding limits the study duration and this effort is no different the equipment was deployed from september 2014 through march 2015 bathymetry velocity and discharge were collected on 07 22 14 and were used to generate the entropy parameters associated with the probability concept times series data was collected from 09 23 14 through 03 13 15 discharges recorded from 07 22 14 through 03 13 15 ranged from 0 62 m3 s to 4 8 m3 s to gage the magnitude of discharges experienced during the study a flow duration curve was prepared using eight years of record obtained from the usgs national water information system nwis database for usgs streamgage 09064600 10 01 17 to 03 13 15 http dx doi org 10 5066 f7p55kjn the results suggests discharges equal to or greater than 4 8 m3 s were exceeded 18 4 percent or alternatively the deployment captured 81 6 percent of the streamflow events recorded it is our opinion the range of discharge recorded at the site is sufficient for this proof of concept open water measurements 232 and 233 table 1 were not used to develop the stage discharge rating and a comparison of measurement 234 suggests irregularities exist in the vertical velocity profiles at the selected measuring cross sections the conventional discharge measurements summarized in table 1 were based on an adcp or midsection method using 0 2d 0 8d and 0 6d point velocities the usgs program extrap usgs 2015b was used to characterize an appropriate top and bottom discharge extrapolation derived from streampro data measurements 231 and 234 accessed at http waterdata usgs gov nwis measurements site no 09064600 agency cd usgs format html table expanded which indicate the 0 2d 0 8d and 0 6d velocities are less when compared to the 1 6th power law and result in conventional midsection measurements that under compute discharge the 1 6th power law is an approximation of the conventional log law velocity distribution which is the basis for computing discharge using the midsection method however in riverine systems where umax occurs below the water surface in a given subsection the 1 6th power law or log law cannot adequately characterize the velocity distribution in that sub discharge therefore an alternative method adcp or velocity distribution model such as those proposed by chiu 1989 and guo and julien 2008 is needed to better characterize the velocity distribution in a subsection for example guo and julien 2008 report that in most natural rivers flow patterns are three dimensional due to the presence of large scale free surface secondary currents nezu et al 1993 the measured umax generally occurs below the free surface at a distance of 0 05 to 0 25 of the flow depth chow 1959 p 24 cheng and gartner 2003 moramarco et al 2004 and is termed the velocity dip phenomenon jarrett 1991 suggests a logarithmic velocity profile does not develop in some high elevation mountain streams because of the extreme drag imposed by the bed material and the high velocities near the water surface using conventional methods 0 2d 0 8d and 0 6d the estimated mean velocity in the vertical is consistently smaller than the true mean velocity in a given vertical therefore accurately modeling the dip phenomenon is significant for computing real time discharge using algorithms such as the probability concept the authors are not asserting that all midsection measurements are invalid it can be shown that the 0 2d 0 8d and 0 6d point velocities can be derived from the power law chapra 1997 and are effective when computing discharge because a sufficient number of verticals 25 30 vis à vis sub discharges rantz et al 1982 are used to adequately discretize the discharge in a cross section we are suggesting midsection measurements made using a flowtracker or current meter at 0 2d 0 8d and 0 6d underestimate discharge at the eagle river near minturn usgs 09064600 for example discharge measurements 233 and 234 were collected in the morning of 08 21 17 using a flowtracker and tadcp respectively and measured 1 69 m3 s and 2 01 m3 s which equates to a percent difference of 15 2 the gage height reported for both was 3 04 feet which suggests there was no change in streamflow conditions during the measurements it appears that adcp measurements offer a more accurate measure of streamflow at the site therefore adcp measurements should be used from the bank operated cableway or a portable pulley system this contention is based on observations offered by usgs hydro technicians responsible for maintaining the streamflow record at the site conventional under ice discharge measurements pose safety issues can be time consuming and are generally rated poor rantz et al 1982 the station analysis notes for the period 12 03 13 through 02 04 15 indicate conventional measurements especially those of lower discharges appear to be under computing discharge which is consistent with some high elevation mountain streams as reported by jarrett 1991 the winter record at this station is substantially affected by ice and backwater effects daily mean discharges were estimated using under ice measurements and open water reference hydrographs for the period of 11 11 14 through 03 13 15 usgs stations usgs 09081600 crystal river above avalanche creek near redstone co and 09067020 eagle river below the wastewater treatment plant at avon co http dx doi org 10 5066 f7p55kjn four accuracy classifications are used to rate station records a rating of excellent suggests that 95 percent of the daily mean discharges are within 5 percent of the true discharge good is within 10 percent fair is within 15 percent and poor suggests that daily mean discharges have less than a fair rating novak 1985 both the open water stage discharge derived daily mean discharge and the estimated daily mean discharge during the ice affected period are considered poor the index velocity rating is an effective estimate of the winter record because flows may be inferred from as few as two direct measurements during a winter period moore et al 2002 healy and hicks 2004 suggest that index velocity ratings have the potential to streamline winter discharge measurements by enhancing safety and increasing the frequency of measurements ratings were developed using regression techniques levesque and oberg 2012 where the mean channel velocity for the standard section is correlated to the measured index velocity from the iq plus or streampro the index velocity rating is used in conjunction with a stage area rating at the cross section where the iq plus is deployed to compute the mean channel velocity and the cross sectional area which are then multiplied to compute discharge 6 1 1 stage discharge and index velocity ratings stage discharge ratings are generally established using graphical analysis of hydroacoustic and current meter based discharge measurements which are collected at prescribed times and events during the wy discharge measurements are compiled and maintained in a database which are quality assured and include shifts or corrections that reflect rating changes during normal operations shifts are applied mathematically to a defined stage discharge rating and discharge is derived from a measured stage value for wy 2014 and wy 2015 the discharge rating at eagle river near minturn streamgage is poor although the stage discharge and index velocity ratings rely on standard usgs techniques quantifying the velocity distribution in mountain streams containing cobbles boulders gravel and sand is a challenge and is attributed to the extreme drag imposed by the bed material and high velocities near the water surface this results in an increase in the rating uncertainty although trans mountain and upstream irrigation diversions influence the daily mean streamflow and relevant statistics they have no effect on the quality of the record an index velocity rating was developed using relevant and available velocity and discharge measurements ranging from 0 7 m3 s to 4 17 m3 s and included the 07 22 14 high flow event and under ice events the quality of the index velocity rating may come into question given the number of measurements used however the index is based on discharges that capture 81 6 percent of the streamflow events recorded for the period of record usgs field measurements can be accessed using the usgs nwis database http waterdata usgs gov nwis measurements site no 09064600 agency cd usgs format html table expanded standard usgs procedures and techniques outlined in levesque and oberg 2012 were followed as previously stated a non standard velocity profile is one that cannot be characterized by a power law or log law that is umax occurs below the water surface the probability concept accounts for non standard velocity profiles and by averaging the multi cell velocities recorded at the y axis by the iq plus it was assumed the velocity index rating accounts for non standard velocity profiles mean channel velocities from five measurements 231 235 236 237 and 239 were plotted against the depth averaged velocities recorded by the iq plus and concurrent conventional discharge measurements the iq plus was located at the y axis averaging the available velocity bins in the vertical for a given 15 min time stamp will account for non standard velocities the coefficient of determination r2 for index velocity rating 0 96 because the iq plus was not deployed during measurement 231 the depth averaged velocity at the y axis was computed from an smba acquired from the streampro it should be noted that using a different instrument other than that used for index rating development may introduce errors our hypothesis is the discharge can be computed using the probability concept and a single velocity profile at the y axis regardless of the hydroacoustic source given this assertion and a 9 percent difference between the 07 22 14 probability concept streampro smba discharge and the conventional tadcp discharge it is the authors opinion that data from the streampro can be used to generate the index velocity rating measurement 238 was omitted from the analysis because it resulted in a negative regression line and was heavily discounted when used to compute the published record the mean velocity for measurement 238 was larger than that for measurements 237 and 239 and is attributed to the method in which the discharge was collected a trench was cut into the ice for measurement 238 whereas measurements 237 and 239 were collected using ice holes the trench appeared to result in an unrealistic increase in velocity altering the index rating from this linear correlation a time series of velocity was created for the entire deployment schedule the iq plus pressure transducer was used to determine the stage time series for both the probability concept and index velocity rating the vertical beam returns a large reflection indicating a surface slush under the ice surface can distort the reflection making it difficult to determine the exact distance from the transducer head to the surface because pressure flow was not observed during field visits the pressure transducer was used to compute the stage and subsequent area a time series of depth and cross sectional area was established where discharge could be computed using the velocity index 1 v 0 8005 v 2 0 4135 r 2 0 96 where v the mean cross sectional velocity when v 2 is recorded by the iq plus and v 2 depth averaged velocity from available velocity cells from the iq plus at any given time during the deployment discharge is the product of v and the cross sectional area determined from the stage area rating during the deployment 6 2 probability concept the probability concept offers the advantage of delivering near real time discharge at streamgages which are new or lack historical data chiu 1987 all measurements are obtained from the y axis which possesses the maximum information content and is the basis for the probability concept determining the location and magnitude of the umax reduces field time and simplifies discharge computations derivation of eqs 2 through 9 is beyond the scope of this paper the probability concept was pioneered by chiu 1987 and was based on an alternative velocity distribution equation 2 u u max m ln 1 e m 1 ξ ξ max where u velocity as a function of depth at the y axis umax maximum in stream velocity at the y axis m parameter used to describe the velocity distribution ξ ξ max 0 u f u du probability of a randomly sampled point velocity less than or equal to u the probability density function f u can be solved by maximizing shannon s information entropy shannon 1948 chiu 1989 which yields 3 ξ ξ max 0 u f u du 4 f u e a 1 e a 2 u 5 a 1 m u max e m 1 6 a 2 m u max in those cross sections where umax occurs below the water surface such as during ice cover or select open water conditions the velocity distribution at the y axis can be characterized by 7 u u max 1 m ln 1 e m 1 y d h exp 1 1 d h in those instances when umax occurs at the water surface the velocity distribution at the y axis can be characterized by chiu 1987 8 u u max 1 m ln 1 e m 1 y d exp 1 1 d by computing ϕ which is derived from m and directly measuring umax uavg can be estimated 9 ϕ u avg u max e m e m 1 1 m discharge can then be computed using umax and the cross sectional area derived from 10 q ϕ u max a where q discharge ϕ uavg umax function of m umax maximum in stream velocity a cross sectional area uavg mean channel velocity m entropy parameter used to describe the velocity distribution h depth of umax below the water surface at the y axis and d water depth at the y axis for under ice conditions d refers to the distance from the streambed to the bottom of ice for open water conditions d refers to the distance from the streambed to the top of the water surface an r script ver 3 1 1 was developed to compute umax ϕ m and h d from the depth and velocity data vertical velocity profile obtained at the y axis and recorded by the iq plus the nls algorithm bates and chambers 1992 bates and watts 1988 is a nonlinear weighted least squares estimator of the parameters umax m and h d by default eqs 7 and 8 are solved using a gauss newton nonlinear least squares method by measuring umax and stage and calculating m the near real time discharge is computed every 15 min during the field campaign 16 395 measurements were collected and 10 059 measurements had sufficient data to attempt a nonlinear regression 6336 measurements were inconclusive not recorded or did not converge on a solution which occurred when the depth and velocity data measured by the iq plus at the y axis were indeterminate of the 10 059 measurements 2769 measurements were used to compute umax at the water surface and 7290 measurements were used to compute umax at depth instantaneous measurements unless noted for umax uavg cross sectional area and discharge are presented in table 1 7 results for the probability concept to be functional the location of the y axis in open water and under ice cannot change and the values of ϕ and h d must be resilient and reproducible for example if the location of the y axis varied in response to changes in open water or under ice conditions stage or discharge the iq plus would need to be moved a priori similarly if ϕ or h d varied with hydraulic conditions the parameters in eqs 7 and 8 would need to be computed for each measurement recorded to estimate the near real time mean channel velocity and discharge 7 1 stability of the y axis previous field studies chiu et al 2001 fulton and ostrowski 2008 fulton 1999 suggest the location of the y axis is stable and is invariant to changes in stage or discharge this assertion was tested during open water conditions on 07 22 14 09 22 14 and 03 13 15 and one under ice condition on 02 04 15 it is assumed that anchor ice and bank ice formed during the deployment however the extent and duration cannot be confirmed what can be confirmed is that the location of the y axis did not vary during open water or under ice conditions as evidenced by the velocity data and their relation to the y axis the stability of the y axis was validated by collecting vertical velocity profiles at the y axis latitude 39 554181 longitude 106 402155 and at verticals immediately located left and right of the y axis to confirm the magnitude and location of umax field data corroborate the findings of chiu et al 2001 fulton and ostrowski 2008 and fulton 1999 and suggest the location of the y axis during this investigation remained constant regardless of the hydraulic conditions which included open water and under ice conditions variations in channel top width and depth mean channel velocity and discharge 7 2 computing ϕ and h d depending on site conditions such as water depth and velocity the parameters ϕ and h d are computed at the y axis using one of four methods 1 40 s averaged point velocities at prescribed depths 0 1d 0 2d 0 8d and 0 9d using a current meter flowtracker or uadcp 2 surface water velocities from an svr concurrent with a 5 min smba test 3 40 s averaged surface water velocities acquired with the svr and 4 historical discharge measurements because umax is rarely measured directly method 4 requires ϕ be computed using a modified version of equations 7 and 8 to account for velocities measured at 0 2d and 0 8d the point velocities obtained at the y axis are plotted as a function of depth and the r script described in the previous section is used to compute umax ϕ m and h d using non linear regression for each time stamp as previously noted mountain streams such as the eagle river are generally characterized by non standard velocity distributions jarrett 1991 using conventional methods 0 2d 0 8d and 0 6d the estimated mean velocity in the vertical is consistently smaller than the true mean velocity in the vertical subsequently the value of ϕ and h d may differ for open water versus under ice conditions whereas for large river systems characterized by more uniform flow conditions the value of ϕ and h d may be similar for open water and under ice conditions typical velocity distributions for open water and under ice conditions fig 5 are consistent with the findings of chiu and tung 2002 fulton and ostrowski 2008 moramarco et al 2004 crance and frothingham 2008 and healy and hicks 2004 daily mean values of ϕ and h d are summarized in table 2 7 2 1 open water conditions secondary flow currents impact the location and depth of umax depending on the conditions during which the velocity measurement was recorded umax can occur either below eq 7 or at the water surface eq 8 during open water conditions unit values of ϕ varied slightly when compared to daily mean values for example a single vertical profile was used to compute a ϕ value of 0 656 on 07 22 14 whereas 94 measurements aggregated from 00 00 to 23 45 on 10 17 14 resulted in ϕ value of 0 619 by averaging all measurements collected from 09 23 14 through 03 13 15 a ϕ value of 0 607 with a standard deviation of 0 036 was computed for open water conditions table 2 by temporally averaging the 15 min unit values of ϕ and h d derived from the vertical velocity profiles averaging 24 15 min data to produce a daily mean velocity extremes caused by secondary flow currents chiu and tung 2002 and momentum differences related to non zero vertical velocities yang et al 2006 could be reduced these variations are not as prevalent in larger river systems dominated by a more uniform velocity distribution j w fulton and e hittle unpub under ice data 2009 where a single ϕ value was established during the siting phase and used throughout the deployment to forecast discharge regardless of hydraulic variations open water or under ice conditions 7 2 2 under ice conditions during under ice conditions boundary conditions imposed by ice cover fig 6 create a distortion in the velocity distribution where umax invariably occurs below the ice water interface crance and frothingham 2008 unpublished data collected from the red river of the north at grand forks nd usgs 05082500 http dx doi org 10 5066 f7p55kjn from march 2009 to october 2009 suggests a similar velocity distribution developed as presented in fig 5 however a ϕ value of 0 596 was computed for both open water and under ice conditions at grand forks which differs from that observed in the eagle river in contrast the open water 0 656 0 619 and 0 607 and under ice 0 395 0 387 0 383 ϕ values and open water 0 273 and under ice 0 369 0 299 and 0 299 h d values differ for very different flow conditions because h d applies only to conditions where umax occurs below the water surface a value cannot be computed for those times when either h greater than 0 or h 0 the difference in these entropy parameters for open water and under ice conditions may be related to the reduction in the hydraulic depth and accentuated secondary flow currents and non zero vertical velocities that are dominant in small turbulent river systems when compared to larger river systems such as the red river of the north which can be characterized by relatively uniform channel and flow conditions 7 3 comparing conventional and probability concept derived discharges advantages and disadvantages for the purpose of this proof of concept no particular method conventional versus the probability concept was assigned as truth agreement plots index velocity rating versus stage discharge rating and probability concept versus index velocity rating one statistical metric kolmogorov smirnov test ks accessed at http stat ethz ch r manual r devel library stats html ks test html and concurrent discharge measurements provide a measure of comparability between the methods the results offer insights on the advantages and disadvantages of each method regardless of the method stage discharge rating index velocity rating or probability concept comparisons reveal encouraging results depending on the flow conditions and absence presence of ice cover for example the index velocity rating and probability concept returned comparable discharge rates for under ice and low flow conditions however during open water and higher flows the comparisons are less definitive and caution should be used when selecting a particular method probability concept or midsection or instrumentation uadcp and tadcp flowtracker current meter daily and instantaneous discharge time series are presented in figs 7 and 8 discharges derived using the stage discharge rating index velocity rating and probability concept track the advancing and receding limbs of the hydrograph the magnitudes of the stage discharge and index velocity ratings generally derived using non adcp methods are biased low when compared to the probability concept agreement plots are illustrated in figs 9 through 11 during open water periods black dots the comparison between the index velocity and stage discharge ratings fig 9 is poor however the agreement improves with increasing discharge and depth a comparison of the probability concept versus the stage discharge rating fig 10 suggests fair agreement for moderate discharges 1 5 2 0 m3 s however at higher discharges the comparison diverges when comparing the probability concept and the index velocity rating fig 11 agreement at discharges ranging from approximately 0 5 1 m3 s is fair with spread in the data however at higher discharges the agreement degrades it is interesting to note the linearity in the bias at discharges greater than 1 m3 s during under ice periods blue dots figs 9 through 11 all three 3 methods returned similar discharges ranging from approximately 0 5 to 1 0 m3 s it is important to note that each method derives a discharge using very different algorithms and methods therefore it is the discretion of the end user to select the method that is most appropriate for their application during transition periods intermittent open water and under ice and illustrated by the red dots figs 9 through 11 agreement between the stage discharge rating and both index velocity rating and probability concept is poor although the index velocity rating and probability concept exhibit outliers and missing record the comparison is generally favorable fig 11 the ks test returns metrics statistic and p values that allow one to compare the distribution of various populations the two sample ks test is a nonparametric hypothesis test that evaluates the difference between the cumulative distribution functions cdf of two sample data sets the null hypothesis h0 assumes the data are from continuous distributions with equal medians against the alternative hypothesis ha that they are not the ks test results table 3 suggest there is not sufficient information to reject h0 which implies that the probability concept and index velocity rating represent similar distributions during under ice and transition periods however the ks metric suggests none of the three methods yield similar results for open water conditions given the statistical inference associated with the ks metrics it can be concluded that the probability concept and index velocity rating are capable of delivering a real time discharge during under ice and transition conditions conventional and probability concept derived discharges were measured contemporaneously for comparison purposes table 1 six conventional discharge measurements were collected concurrently with probability concept derived discharges with percent differences of 9 0 21 8 6 17 8 3 6 and 2 3 in general the instantaneous probability concept discharges compare favorably to conventional methods differences are larger for those moderate discharges 1 to 2 m3 s where current meters and flowtrackers were used to compute midsection discharges and emphasize the challenges of measuring streamflow in mountain streams that exhibit open water and under ice conditions as stated earlier in this section no one method or result was assumed to represent truth however to provide a measure of uncertainty and in light of recent observations suggesting the stage discharge and index velocity ratings may be improved with the inclusion of adcp measurements the root mean square error rmse in discharge between each of the methods by season was computed the rmse for open water and under ice conditions for the index velocity rating versus the stage discharge rating was 0 32 and 0 07 m3 s respectively the rmse for the probability concept versus the stage discharge was 0 25 and 0 08 m3 s respectively the rmse for the probability concept and the index velocity rating was 0 52 and 0 09 m3 s respectively because of the amount of missing record and uncertainty in the magnitude and extent of frazzle ice or anchor ice the transition period was not included in the analysis the probability concept offers the advantage of 1 providing data that allow a streamgage to be established in a single day 2 reporting discharge based on three variables umax ϕ and area 3 being operational that is transmitting real time data every 15 min 4 accounting for non standard velocity distributions and 5 avoiding the need to collect paired data velocity discharge slope discharge or stage discharge which is based on a range of discharges that can require extensive field work and time for example from november 2014 to january 2015 flow conditions varied from open water to under ice fig 7 where ice periodically forms and breaks up and is influenced by the creation of frazzle and anchor ice ice cover reduces the magnitude of the discharge and effective water depth these temporal changes lead to variations in the water depth ϕ and umax therefore computing discharge based on adcps and the probability concept could be advantageous the disadvantage of the probability concept includes the need to 1 verify the stability of the y axis during various hydraulic extremes and 2 maintain a stage area rating regardless additional field deployments under different hydraulic settings and durations are needed to verify the efficacy of the probability concept index velocity ratings offer the advantage of 1 being operational 2 accepted as a conventional streamgaging method 3 accounting for non standard velocity distributions and 4 reporting discharge based on two variables mean vertical velocity and area the disadvantage of the index velocity rating includes the need to 1 collect paired data which requires extensive field work and time and 2 maintain a stage area rating stage discharge ratings offer the advantage of 1 accepted as a conventional streamgaging method however at ice impacted sites stage discharge ratings are rated poor and are computed after ice breakup using open water reference sites and therefore are not real time in nature 7 4 sources of error the sources of error in measuring under ice discharge can be problematic for water resources managers and other end users open water measurements indicate irregularities at selected vertical velocity profiles based on these findings it is difficult to discern what data represent truth the probability concept is a probabilistic formulation of velocity stage discharge and index velocity ratings are physically based the variables used to compute discharge are common to all three methods and include the cross sectional area and velocity each are subject to uncertainty 7 4 1 cross sectional area the cross sectional area is directly proportional to the computed discharge and is influenced by channel instability associated with sediment transport bank and anchor ice and instrument error a stage area rating was established using an adcp and conventional surveying methods on 07 22 14 and on 03 13 15 the resulting stage area rating differed by 8 percent which was attributed to variations in the exact location of the surveyed cross section and surveyed points in the cross section based on these findings it was assumed that the channel was stable and shift adjustments were not applied to the stage area rating this same rating was used to estimate area as a function of stage during under ice conditions it should be noted that based on the 02 04 15 field visit variations in ice thickness ranged from 0 27 m at the right waters edge to 0 30 m at the left waters edge the maximum ice thickness was 0 52 m approximately 2 7 m west of the uplooking adcps temporal variations in ice thickness may create changes in the cross sectional area which could impose errors in the reported discharge the iq plus is equipped with a primary sensor consisting of a pressure transducer and a vertical acoustic beam which are used to measure stage unfortunately the reflections do not discriminate between an under ice surface and a free water surface variations in the composition of the water such as frazzle ice can distort the reflection an ice detection algorithm is available and is based on the amplitude and signal to noise ratio derived from the velocity profiles however the shallow water depth rendered the algorithm inconclusive pressure flow which can influence discharge computations was not observed during field measurements 7 4 2 velocity the coefficients used to adjust under ice point velocities and needed to compute discharge turnipseed and sauer 2010 rantz et al 1982 terzi 1981 can vary depending on the ice and stream conditions a coefficient of 0 88 walker and wang 1997 used to translate the 0 5d point velocity to a mean vertical velocity for a given vertical was in most instances less than the measured mean vertical velocity because the median adjustment coefficient observed by walker and wang 1997 differs from the generally accepted value of 0 88 for 0 5d use of a single value introduces a systematic bias similarly crance and frothingham 2008 suggest the vertical velocity distribution varies as the roughness of the ice cover changes barrows and horton 1907 report winter flow adjustment coefficients varied considerably from station to station and recommended further investigation by adopting the probability concept there is no need to establish a coefficient with varying hydraulic or ice cover conditions the scatter in the ϕ values may be attributed to secondary flow currents and non zero vertical velocities as a result under ice ϕ values should be computed for a given time stamp to verify these differences and associated scatter additional work is needed this could involve the inclusion of energy and momentum coefficients in the computation of uavg particularly where complex velocity distributions are documented such as that associated with under ice conditions the coefficients are important in the computation of energy gradients water surface profiles and discharge other factors such as the duration at which velocities are sampled and filtering schemes low and high pass filters to better characterize the velocity profile for computing umax and ϕ should be investigated by increasing the sample duration from two minutes to larger averaging times the standard deviation in the velocities recorded by the uadcps should decrease and converge on an expected value this assumes the discharge is not changing dynamically velocity averaging schemes may also impact the amount of filtering needed to reduce noise in the data however a balance between sample averaging and power consumption needs further investigation 8 summary and conclusions computing under ice discharge is important in high elevation high latitude rivers where the winter record is a significant component of the annual water balance however reporting under ice discharge using conventional methods can be problematic a proof of concept was initiated to compute under ice discharges at the usgs streamgage 09064600 eagle river near minturn colorado usa using a variety of hydroacoustic instruments uadcps tadcps and flowtracker coupled with an efficient computational scheme probability concept the results were compared to conventional discharge measurements which included stage discharge and index velocity ratings the probability concept requires that depth and velocity data be collected at a single vertical designated as the y axis in the channel cross section of interest depth and velocity data were collected using uadcps which were installed in september 2014 and operated continuously until march 2015 the entropy parameters ϕ and umax used in the probability concept algorithm were temporally averaged for two minutes and recorded every 15 min discharge was computed by combining these parameters with the stage area rating by temporally averaging the data velocity extremes caused by secondary flow currents and momentum differences related to non zero vertical velocities which are common in shallow high velocity mountain streams such as the eagle river were minimized it should be noted that these velocity variations are not as prevalent in larger river systems dominated by a uniform velocity distribution subsequently the ϕ value established during the siting phase can be used to compute discharge directly regardless of variations in stage or velocity the location of the y axis latitude 39 554181 longitude 106 402155 was assumed to be stable and invariant to changes in stage or discharge this assertion was confirmed by collecting depth and velocity data for various streamflow conditions during open water conditions on 07 22 14 09 22 14 and 03 13 15 and one under ice condition on 02 04 15 conventional and probability concept derived data was collected from september 2014 through march 2015 for the purpose of this proof of concept no particular method stage discharge rating index velocity rating probability concept was assigned as truth therefore the two sample kolmogorov smirnov test was selected to compare the distribution of discharges derived using these various methods assuming a p value of 0 05 the two sample ks test suggests there is not sufficient information to reject h0 which implies that the probability concept and index velocity rating represent similar distributions during under ice and transition periods however the ks metric suggests none of the three methods yield similar results for open water conditions in addition six conventional discharge measurements were collected concurrently with probability concept derived discharges and exhibited differences of 9 0 21 8 6 17 8 3 6 and 2 3 these results suggest that the instantaneous probability concept discharges compare favorably to conventional methods for a variety of streamflow conditions this proof of concept demonstrates that instantaneous discharges can be computed using the probability concept for a range of hydraulic extremes variations in discharge open water and under ice conditions and immediately after the siting phase is complete this is particularly important at sites where new streamgages are planned or at hydraulically complex sites where shifts and corrections are necessary to address changes in cross sectional area a stage area relation must be developed and maintained for the stage discharge rating velocity index rating and probability concept however because the probability concept operates in real time it does not require a history of contemporaneous stage or velocity and discharge measurements over a range of extreme flow conditions to return a discharge

7253,under ice discharge is estimated using open water reference hydrographs however the ratings for ice affected sites are generally qualified as poor the u s geological survey usgs in collaboration with the colorado water conservation board conducted a proof of concept to develop an alternative method for computing under ice discharge using hydroacoustics and the probability concept the study site was located south of minturn colorado co usa and was selected because of 1 its proximity to the existing usgs streamgage 09064600 eagle river near minturn co and 2 its ease of access to verify discharge using a variety of conventional methods from late september 2014 to early march 2015 hydraulic conditions varied from open water to under ice these temporal changes led to variations in water depth and velocity hydroacoustics tethered and uplooking acoustic doppler current profilers and acoustic doppler velocimeters were deployed to measure the vertical velocity profile at a singularly important vertical of the channel cross section because the velocity profile was non standard and cannot be characterized using a power law or log law velocity data were analyzed using the probability concept which is a probabilistic formulation of the velocity distribution the probability concept derived discharge was compared to conventional methods including stage discharge and index velocity ratings and concurrent field measurements each is complicated by the dynamics of ice formation pressure influences on stage measurements and variations in cross sectional area due to ice formation no particular discharge method was assigned as truth rather one statistical metric kolmogorov smirnov ks agreement plots and concurrent measurements provided a measure of comparability between various methods regardless of the method employed comparisons between each method revealed encouraging results depending on the flow conditions and the absence or presence of ice cover for example during lower discharges dominated by under ice and transition intermittent open water and under ice conditions the ks metric suggests there is not sufficient information to reject the null hypothesis and implies that the probability concept and index velocity rating represent similar distributions during high flow open water conditions the comparisons are less definitive therefore it is important that the appropriate analytical method and instrumentation be selected six conventional discharge measurements were collected concurrently with probability concept derived discharges with percent differences of 9 0 21 8 6 17 8 3 6 and 2 3 this proof of concept demonstrates that riverine discharges can be computed using the probability concept for a range of hydraulic extremes variations in discharge open water and under ice conditions immediately after the siting phase is complete which typically requires one day computing real time discharges is particularly important at sites where 1 new streamgages are planned 2 river hydraulics are complex and 3 shifts in the stage discharge rating are needed to correct the streamflow record use of the probability concept does not preclude the need to maintain a stage area relation both the probability concept and index velocity rating offer water resource managers and decision makers alternatives for computing real time discharge for open water and under ice conditions keywords under ice discharge hydroacoustics probability concept streamflow information entropy 1 introduction ice formation alters the stage discharge rating at more than 50 percent of the natural rivers where continuous record streamgages are maintained by the u s geological survey usgs melcher and walker 1992 additionally most stations operated by the water survey of canada wsc are subject to ice affected discharge during the winter months wiebe et al 1989 field methods to measure daily under ice discharge rantz et al 1982 terzi 1981 are established by the usgs and wsc however the methods are time consuming costly and may place hydrographers at risk for safety this proof of concept demonstrates that instantaneous discharges unit values can be computed using the probability concept chiu 1987 for a range of hydraulic extremes in open water and under ice conditions dominated by variations in discharge and stage the ability of the probability concept to compute discharge for a range of conditions is particularly important at ungaged sites at new streamgage locations or at hydraulically complex sites where shifts and corrections are necessary however like the index velocity method a stage area relation must be maintained the probability concept offers water resource managers and decision makers an alternative method for measuring real time streamflow without the need to develop and maintain a stage discharge rating 2 purpose characterizing under ice discharge is important particularly in high elevation and high latitude rivers where the winter record is a significant component of the annual water balance the usgs in collaboration with the colorado water conservation board cwcb conducted a proof of concept to develop an alternative method for measuring under ice discharge the goals were to develop a method that 1 applies to streamgages that are new or lack historical data and 2 computes under ice discharge regardless of the hydraulic condition at the time when the instrumentation is sited and deployed 3 previous studies methods for directly measuring or indirectly computing under ice discharge have been proposed by a number of investigators these include field and computational studies 3 1 field studies generally under ice discharges are computed using the midsection or velocity area method which requires depth averaged velocities and cross sectional channel subareas because of the boundary created by ice cover the velocity distribution is non standard one cannot be characterized using a log law or power law and the location of the maximum instream velocity umax can occur at various distances h below the ice cover as a function of discharge throughout the ice affected period it is recommended that two vertical velocity profiles be collected with each ice measurement to determine the coefficient needed to convert the 0 2d 0 8d or 0 6d velocities to a mean vertical velocity generally the average of the velocities obtained by the 0 2d 0 8d method produces a mean velocity but a coefficient of 0 92 is needed for velocities obtained by the 0 6d method where d actual flow depth from the bottom of the ice cover to the streambed turnipseed and sauer 2010 rantz et al 1982 terzi 1981 the usgs and wsc validated the methods used for measuring under ice discharges by initiating independent and coordinated programs and collecting vertical velocity profiles walker and wang 1997 during the winter from 1988 to 1989 the usgs made 115 measurements consisting of 2300 vertical velocity profiles during the winter from 1989 to 1991 the wsc made 83 measurements resulting in 1800 individual vertical velocity profiles the data were compiled to create a database containing hydraulic variables for 4100 under ice profiles in general an adjustment coefficient of 0 88 is used to translate the 0 5d point velocity to a mean vertical velocity for a given vertical however in most instances this coefficient is less than the measured mean vertical velocity reported by walker and wang 1997 which is summarized in their table 2 because the median adjustment coefficients differs from the generally accepted value of 0 88 use of a single value introduces a systematic bias crance and frothingham 2008 suggest that the vertical velocity distribution varies as the roughness of the ice cover changes with an increase in the ice cover roughness the relative position of umax and the mean vertical velocities are different and they tend to migrate closer to the streambed when the ice cover roughness increases additionally vertically averaged velocities tend to be greater than those predicted using the 0 6d and 0 2d 0 8d methods with the recommended value of 0 92 for the 0 6d method they suggest a coefficient of 0 75 be used healy and hicks 2004 and clow and fleming 2008 directly measured under ice discharge healy and hicks 2004 relied on index velocity methods and examined data for eight hydrometric stations the results suggest the existence of a unique relation between the index velocity and the mean channel velocity the consistency of the location of umax and the velocity panel was not strongly correlated to the quality of the index velocity relationship clow and fleming 2008 deployed an automated dye dilution gaging system to measure discharge in ice affected streams rhodamine wt was injected into the stream at a constant rate and downstream concentrations were measured with a submersible fluorometer data loggers were programed to control system operations monitor key variables and perform discharge computations on the basis of dye dilution a comparison of discharge from the tracer gage and from a cipoletti weir during periods of extensive ice cover resulted in a root mean square error rmse of the tracer gage equal to 0 029 cubic meters per second m3 s or 6 3 percent of the mean discharge for the study period 3 2 computational studies lau 1981 meyer 2009 and sui et al 2010 developed equations for characterizing the velocity distribution for under ice conditions lau 1981 proposed a κ ε kinetic energy and rate of dissipation turbulence model with varying top under ice and bottom channel bottom boundary roughness and suggested that the mean vertical velocity based on the 0 2d 0 8d point velocities approximates the mean vertical velocity for a given vertical however examination of the velocity data shows that the profiles deviate from the standard logarithmic distribution for more than 40 percent of the flow depth in contrast the correction coefficient for translating the 0 6d velocity to a mean vertical velocity is 5 percent different from the referenced value of 0 88 meyer 2009 modified the logarithmic tachoida for ice cover by assuming the velocity profile consists of two water layers whereas sui et al 2010 reported the depth averaged velocity for open water was greater than that for ice cover dominated by smooth or rough conditions additionally the depth averaged velocity under smooth ice cover was similar to rough ice cover 4 study site the study site is collocated with usgs streamgage 09064600 eagle river near minturn colorado usa fig 1 latitude 39 554368 longitude 106 402223 north american datum 1983 approximately 4 0 km km southeast of minturn colorado and approximately 183 m m upstream from the highway 24 bridge over the eagle river fig 2 the site was selected because of 1 its proximity to the existing usgs streamgage with an historical record and 2 its ease of access to verify discharge the headwaters of the eagle river originate in the white river national forest and drain northwest towards the site which is located in a high mountain environment elevation approximately 2466 m m the 482 square kilometers km2 drainage area upstream from the site is characterized by steep and rugged terrain where the mean basin slope is 34 percent and the mean basin elevation is 3261 m usgs 2015a the basin is covered primarily by evergreen and deciduous forest the stream channel is a mountain stream and consists mostly of cobbles boulders gravel and sand at the study site the channel flows across quaternary alluvium surrounded by artificial fill placed to create level ground for highway 24 to the east the area west of the site is underlain by late pleistocene glacial deposits and the pinedale till kirkham et al 2012 most streamflow in the eagle river is derived from seasonal snowmelt runoff peak discharge occurs generally between late may and early june lower discharges generally occur from december through mid march individual field measurements summarizing channel hydraulics and geometry can be accessed at https waterdata usgs gov nwis measurements site no 09064600 agency cd

sontek ysi sontek flowtracker acoustic doppler velocimeter flowtracker 3 teledyne rd instruments trdi streampro streampro acoustic doppler current profiler adcp which was tethered from bank to bank tadcp and 4 sontek iq plus iq plus and trdi v adcp both uplooking acoustic doppler current profilers uadcp 5 1 radar and hydroacoustics selection the svr is a hand held non contact continuous wave radar that operates at 34 7 ghz ghz and measures the surface water velocity by computing a shift in the transmitted and received frequencies doppler shift the unit is not capable of measuring stage and does not include an intrinsic algorithm for computing discharge however because of its portability is used to identify the location of the y axis the vertical in the channel cross section that contains umax which was based on the maximum surface water velocity ud to complement the svr a flowtracker and streampro were used to characterize the vertical velocity distribution at various depths at the y axis the flowtracker is a hydroacoustic velocimeter that functions on a wading rod and measures water velocities using 10 mhz mhz sound bursts the streampro is a 2 0 mhz tadcp that is generally tethered from bank to bank and provides a measure of the cross sectional area and velocity and computes discharge it is capable of measuring channels ranging in depth from 10 cm to 7 m deep sontek 2016 the iq plus is an uadcp and the components are entirely self contained in the transducer head assembly the iq plus relies on an external power supply and includes an internal 4 gb data recorder the transducer head uses four 3 0 mhz acoustic beams to measure velocity there is one vertical beam and an integrated pressure sensor to measure stream depth above the unit the iq plus utilizes a thermistor to measure water temperature compensates for speed of sound corrections and is capable of monitoring 100 depth cells with a profiling range of 0 06 to 4 88 m depth and velocity

stand alone unit comprising two components an independent transducer head and separate electronics housing that incorporates a 4 mb data recorder and internal power supply the transducer head uses three 2 4 mhz acoustic beams to measure velocity and one vertical acoustic beam to measure stream depth above the unit the v adcp uses a thermistor to measure water temperature to correct for the speed of sound in water and is capable of measuring from 3 to 150 depth cells with a profiling range of 0 18 to 4 88 m and can be configured using bb talk software data recorded by the unit must be downloaded to a laptop for post processing as previously stated the v adcp operates at 2 4 mhz whereas the iq plus operates at 3 0 mhz although no specific measures were taken to examine acoustic interferences between the units no suspicious data were observed that indicated substantive acoustic noise 5 2 deployment mounting the adcps so that the instruments occupied the same vertical in the transect yet allow leveling to minimize pitch and roll errors was a challenge a mounting bracket was designed using 1 9 cm diameter rigid electrical conduit 90 degree offset pipe rail fittings and electrical conduit strut fig 3 the mount incorporated two of the 90 degree offset fittings on each end allowing for complete pitch and roll adjustments after the mount was secured to two semi vertical lengths of conduit driven into the streambed using a slide hammer this design facilitated easy removal using a t post puller or high lift jack to extract the vertical pipes and mount from the streambed 5 3 communications a sutron satlink 2 data logger goes satellite transmitter was installed to telemeter data from the iq plus the iq plus is sdi 12 serial digital interface at 1200 baud accessed at http sdi 12 org specification php compliant which allows seamless integration of different data loggers capable of polling sdi 12 sensors the data logger was configured to poll specific parameters of interest the v adcp does not have an sdi 12 output option so telemetering would require more equipment than the scope of this project intended data from the v adcp unit were periodically downloaded manually velocity data recorded by the v adcp were not available for the entire deployment period because of configuration needs under ice water depths approached the operating limits of the unit as it was configured at installation data from the iq plus data were available for the entire study period and were periodically downloaded in the field and analyzed in the office select parameters were telemetered via the sutron satlink2 data logger goes transmitter velocities were sampled for two minutes and measurements made every 15 min unit values of the signal to noise ratio which is a measure of acoustic data quality ϕ ratio of mean channel velocity uavg and umax temperature and depth are illustrated in fig 4 as a b c and d respectively 5 4 y axis the location of the y axis was initially determined during the site visit on 07 22 14 using velocity and depth data acquired from a flowtracker and stationary moving bed analyses smba mueller et al 2013 and svr lee and julien 2006 suggest that modeling the location of umax is significant when establishing stage discharge relations it is also important when defining the relation between surface water velocities and the mean channel velocity chiu and tung 2002 and fulton and ostrowski 2008 suggest umax coincides with ud to confirm this contention point velocities along the y axis were measured immediately below the water surface to the channel bottom using a flowtracker at intervals that adequately defined the velocity distribution depending on water depth this should include a minimum of 6 point velocities near surface 0 2d 0 4d 0 6d 0 8d close to the channel bottom or greater the procedure was repeated at prescribed distances to the left and right of the y axis which was verified to be at latitude 39 554181 longitude 106 402155 on four separate occasions 07 22 14 09 22 14 02 04 15 and 03 13 15 during low and high streamflow events and during open water and under ice conditions these results suggest the location of the y axis at minturn is stable and does not vary with stage velocity or discharge after establishing the y axis location two uadcps iq plus serial number iq1317014 and v adcp serial number 61211 were installed near the channel bottom and oriented vertically to measure umax in accordance with the computational tenets prescribed by the probability concept and index velocity method below 6 computational methods methods for computing open water and under ice discharge levesque and oberg 2012 turnipseed and sauer 2010 rantz et al 1982 buchanan and somers 1969 include conventional methods stage discharge ratings index velocity ratings and the probability concept chiu 1987 all measurements are obtained using a current meter flowtracker or streampro or uadcp 6 1 conventional methods conventional open water and under ice discharge measurements were collected to maintain the stage discharge rating and facilitate winter estimates at the usgs streamgage 09064600 eagle river near minturn co table 1 an index velocity rating was established using three open water and two under ice discharge measurements and velocity data from the iq plus and streampro had the deployment period spanned several years developing one rating for open water and one for under ice conditions would be justified given the short duration of this proof of concept a sufficient number of extreme flow events could not be measured that would fully characterize streamflow conditions at the site both ratings were used to verify the probability concept derived discharges for water years wy 2014 2015 10 01 13 through 09 30 15 as with any research available funding limits the study duration and this effort is no different the equipment was deployed from september 2014 through march 2015 bathymetry velocity and discharge were collected on 07 22 14 and were used to generate the entropy parameters associated with the probability concept times series data was collected from 09 23 14 through 03 13 15 discharges recorded from 07 22 14 through 03 13 15 ranged from 0 62 m3 s to 4 8 m3 s to gage the magnitude of discharges experienced during the study a flow duration curve was prepared using eight years of record obtained from the usgs national water information system nwis database for usgs streamgage 09064600 10 01 17 to 03 13 15 http dx doi org 10 5066 f7p55kjn the results suggests discharges equal to or greater than 4 8 m3 s were exceeded 18 4 percent or alternatively the deployment captured 81 6 percent of the streamflow events recorded it is our opinion the range of discharge recorded at the site is sufficient for this proof of concept open water measurements 232 and 233 table 1 were not used to develop the stage discharge rating and a comparison of measurement 234 suggests irregularities exist in the vertical velocity profiles at the selected measuring cross sections the conventional discharge measurements summarized in table 1 were based on an adcp or midsection method using 0 2d 0 8d and 0 6d point velocities the usgs program extrap usgs 2015b was used to characterize an appropriate top and bottom discharge extrapolation derived from streampro data measurements 231 and 234 accessed at http waterdata usgs gov nwis measurements site no 09064600 agency cd usgs format html table expanded which indicate the 0 2d 0 8d and 0 6d velocities are less when compared to the 1 6th power law and result in conventional midsection measurements that under compute discharge the 1 6th power law is an approximation of the conventional log law velocity distribution which is the basis for computing discharge using the midsection method however in riverine systems where umax occurs below the water surface in a given subsection the 1 6th power law or log law cannot adequately characterize the velocity distribution in that sub discharge therefore an alternative method adcp or velocity distribution model such as those proposed by chiu 1989 and guo and julien 2008 is needed to better characterize the velocity distribution in a subsection for example guo and julien 2008 report that in most natural rivers flow patterns are three dimensional due to the presence of large scale free surface secondary currents nezu et al 1993 the measured umax generally occurs below the free surface at a distance of 0 05 to 0 25 of the flow depth chow 1959 p 24 cheng and gartner 2003 moramarco et al 2004 and is termed the velocity dip phenomenon jarrett 1991 suggests a logarithmic velocity profile does not develop in some high elevation mountain streams because of the extreme drag imposed by the bed material and the high velocities near the water surface using conventional methods 0 2d 0 8d and 0 6d the estimated mean velocity in the vertical is consistently smaller than the true mean velocity in a given vertical therefore accurately modeling the dip phenomenon is significant for computing real time discharge using algorithms such as the probability concept the authors are not asserting that all midsection measurements are invalid it can be shown that the 0 2d 0 8d and 0 6d point velocities can be derived from the power law chapra 1997 and are effective when computing discharge because a sufficient number of verticals 25 30 vis à vis sub discharges rantz et al 1982 are used to adequately discretize the discharge in a cross section we are suggesting midsection measurements made using a flowtracker or current meter at 0 2d 0 8d and 0 6d underestimate discharge at the eagle river near minturn usgs 09064600 for example discharge measurements 233 and 234 were collected in the morning of 08 21 17 using a flowtracker and tadcp respectively and measured 1 69 m3 s and 2 01 m3 s which equates to a percent difference of 15 2 the gage height reported for both was 3 04 feet which suggests there was no change in streamflow conditions during the measurements it appears that adcp measurements offer a more accurate measure of streamflow at the site therefore adcp measurements should be used from the bank operated cableway or a portable pulley system this contention is based on observations offered by usgs hydro technicians responsible for maintaining the streamflow record at the site conventional under ice discharge measurements pose safety issues can be time consuming and are generally rated poor rantz et al 1982 the station analysis notes for the period 12 03 13 through 02 04 15 indicate conventional measurements especially those of lower discharges appear to be under computing discharge which is consistent with some high elevation mountain streams as reported by jarrett 1991 the winter record at this station is substantially affected by ice and backwater effects daily mean discharges were estimated using under ice measurements and open water reference hydrographs for the period of 11 11 14 through 03 13 15 usgs stations usgs 09081600 crystal river above avalanche creek near redstone co and 09067020 eagle river below the wastewater treatment plant at avon co http dx doi org 10 5066 f7p55kjn four accuracy classifications are used to rate station records a rating of excellent suggests that 95 percent of the daily mean discharges are within 5 percent of the true discharge good is within 10 percent fair is within 15 percent and poor suggests that daily mean discharges have less than a fair rating novak 1985 both the open water stage discharge derived daily mean discharge and the estimated daily mean discharge during the ice affected period are considered poor the index velocity rating is an effective estimate of the winter record because flows may be inferred from as few as two direct measurements during a winter period moore et al 2002 healy and hicks 2004 suggest that index velocity ratings have the potential to streamline winter discharge measurements by enhancing safety and increasing the frequency of measurements ratings were developed using regression techniques levesque and oberg 2012 where the mean channel velocity for the standard section is correlated to the measured index velocity from the iq plus or streampro the index velocity rating is used in conjunction with a stage area rating at the cross section where the iq plus is deployed to compute the mean channel velocity and the cross sectional area which are then multiplied to compute discharge 6 1 1 stage discharge and index velocity ratings stage discharge ratings are generally established using graphical analysis of hydroacoustic and current meter based discharge measurements which are collected at prescribed times and events during the wy discharge measurements are compiled and maintained in a database which are quality assured and include shifts or corrections that reflect rating changes during normal operations shifts are applied mathematically to a defined stage discharge rating and discharge is derived from a measured stage value for wy 2014 and wy 2015 the discharge rating at eagle river near minturn streamgage is poor although the stage discharge and index velocity ratings rely on standard usgs techniques quantifying the velocity distribution in mountain streams containing cobbles boulders gravel and sand is a challenge and is attributed to the extreme drag imposed by the bed material and high velocities near the water surface this results in an increase in the rating uncertainty although trans mountain and upstream irrigation diversions influence the daily mean streamflow and relevant statistics they have no effect on the quality of the record an index velocity rating was developed using relevant and available velocity and discharge measurements ranging from 0 7 m3 s to 4 17 m3 s and included the 07 22 14 high flow event and under ice events the quality of the index velocity rating may come into question given the number of measurements used however the index is based on discharges that capture 81 6 percent of the streamflow events recorded for the period of record usgs field measurements can be accessed using the usgs nwis database http waterdata usgs gov nwis measurements site no 09064600 agency cd usgs format html table expanded standard usgs procedures and techniques outlined in levesque and oberg 2012 were followed as previously stated a non standard velocity profile is one that cannot be characterized by a power law or log law that is umax occurs below the water surface the probability concept accounts for non standard velocity profiles and by averaging the multi cell velocities recorded at the y axis by the iq plus it was assumed the velocity index rating accounts for non standard velocity profiles mean channel velocities from five measurements 231 235 236 237 and 239 were plotted against the depth averaged velocities recorded by the iq plus and concurrent conventional discharge measurements the iq plus was located at the y axis averaging the available velocity bins in the vertical for a given 15 min time stamp will account for non standard velocities the coefficient of determination r2 for index velocity rating 0 96 because the iq plus was not deployed during measurement 231 the depth averaged velocity at the y axis was computed from an smba acquired from the streampro it should be noted that using a different instrument other than that used for index rating development may introduce errors our hypothesis is the discharge can be computed using the probability concept and a single velocity profile at the y axis regardless of the hydroacoustic source given this assertion and a 9 percent difference between the 07 22 14 probability concept streampro smba discharge and the conventional tadcp discharge it is the authors opinion that data from the streampro can be used to generate the index velocity rating measurement 238 was omitted from the analysis because it resulted in a negative regression line and was heavily discounted when used to compute the published record the mean velocity for measurement 238 was larger than that for measurements 237 and 239 and is attributed to the method in which the discharge was collected a trench was cut into the ice for measurement 238 whereas measurements 237 and 239 were collected using ice holes the trench appeared to result in an unrealistic increase in velocity altering the index rating from this linear correlation a time series of velocity was created for the entire deployment schedule the iq plus pressure transducer was used to determine the stage time series for both the probability concept and index velocity rating the vertical beam returns a large reflection indicating a surface slush under the ice surface can distort the reflection making it difficult to determine the exact distance from the transducer head to the surface because pressure flow was not observed during field visits the pressure transducer was used to compute the stage and subsequent area a time series of depth and cross sectional area was established where discharge could be computed using the velocity index 1 v 0 8005 v 2 0 4135 r 2 0 96 where v the mean cross sectional velocity when v 2 is recorded by the iq plus and v 2 depth averaged velocity from available velocity cells from the iq plus at any given time during the deployment discharge is the product of v and the cross sectional area determined from the stage area rating during the deployment 6 2 probability concept the probability concept offers the advantage of delivering near real time discharge at streamgages which are new or lack historical data chiu 1987 all measurements are obtained from the y axis which possesses the maximum information content and is the basis for the probability concept determining the location and magnitude of the umax reduces field time and simplifies discharge computations derivation of eqs 2 through 9 is beyond the scope of this paper the probability concept was pioneered by chiu 1987 and was based on an alternative velocity distribution equation 2 u u max m ln 1 e m 1 ξ ξ max where u velocity as a function of depth at the y axis umax maximum in stream velocity at the y axis m parameter used to describe the velocity distribution ξ ξ max 0 u f u du probability of a randomly sampled point velocity less than or equal to u the probability density function f u can be solved by maximizing shannon s information entropy shannon 1948 chiu 1989 which yields 3 ξ ξ max 0 u f u du 4 f u e a 1 e a 2 u 5 a 1 m u max e m 1 6 a 2 m u max in those cross sections where umax occurs below the water surface such as during ice cover or select open water conditions the velocity distribution at the y axis can be characterized by 7 u u max 1 m ln 1 e m 1 y d h exp 1 1 d h in those instances when umax occurs at the water surface the velocity distribution at the y axis can be characterized by chiu 1987 8 u u max 1 m ln 1 e m 1 y d exp 1 1 d by computing ϕ which is derived from m and

umax function of m umax maximum in stream velocity a cross sectional area uavg mean channel velocity m entropy parameter used to describe the velocity distribution h depth of umax below the water surface at the y axis and d water depth at the y axis for under ice conditions d refers to the distance from the streambed to the bottom of ice for open water conditions d refers to the distance from the streambed to the top of the water surface an r script ver 3 1 1 was developed to compute umax ϕ m and h d from the depth and velocity data vertical velocity profile obtained at the y axis and recorded by the iq plus the nls algorithm bates and chambers 1992 bates and watts 1988 is a nonlinear weighted least squares estimator of the parameters umax m and h d by default eqs 7 and 8 are solved using a gauss newton nonlinear least squares method by measuring umax and stage and calculating m the near real time discharge is computed every 15 min during the field campaign 16 395 measurements were collected and 10 059 measurements had sufficient data to attempt a nonlinear regression 6336 measurements were inconclusive not recorded or did not converge on a solution which occurred when the depth and velocity data measured by the iq plus at the y axis were indeterminate of the 10 059 measurements 2769 measurements were used to compute umax at the water surface and 7290 measurements were used to compute umax at depth instantaneous measurements unless noted for umax uavg cross sectional area and discharge are presented in table 1 7 results for the probability concept to be functional the location of the y axis in open water and under ice cannot change and the values of ϕ and h d must be resilient and reproducible for example if the location of the y axis varied in response to changes in open water or under ice conditions stage or discharge the iq plus would need to be moved a priori similarly if ϕ or h d varied with hydraulic conditions the parameters in eqs 7 and 8 would need to be computed for each measurement recorded to estimate the near real time mean channel velocity and discharge 7 1 stability of the y axis previous field studies chiu et al 2001 fulton and ostrowski 2008 fulton 1999 suggest the location of the y axis is stable and is invariant to changes in stage or discharge this assertion was tested during open water conditions on 07 22 14 09 22 14 and 03 13 15 and one under ice condition on 02 04 15 it is assumed that anchor ice and bank ice formed during the deployment however the extent and duration cannot be confirmed what can be confirmed is that the location of the y axis did not vary during open water or under ice conditions as evidenced by the velocity data and their relation to the y axis the stability of the y axis was validated by collecting vertical velocity profiles at the y axis latitude 39 554181 longitude 106 402155 and at verticals immediately located left and right of the y axis to confirm the magnitude and location of umax field data corroborate the findings of chiu et al 2001 fulton and ostrowski 2008 and fulton 1999 and suggest the location of the y axis during this investigation remained constant regardless of the hydraulic conditions which included open water and under ice conditions variations in channel top width and depth mean channel velocity and discharge 7 2 computing ϕ and h d depending on site conditions such as water depth and velocity the parameters ϕ and h d are computed at the y axis using one of four methods 1 40 s averaged point velocities at prescribed depths 0 1d 0 2d 0 8d and 0 9d using a current meter flowtracker or uadcp 2 surface water velocities from an svr concurrent with a 5 min smba test 3 40 s averaged surface water velocities acquired with the svr and 4 historical discharge measurements because umax is rarely measured directly method 4 requires ϕ be computed using a modified version of equations 7 and 8 to account for velocities measured at 0 2d and 0 8d the point velocities obtained at the y axis are plotted as a function of depth and the r script described in the previous section is used to compute umax ϕ m and h d using non linear regression for each time stamp as previously noted mountain streams such as the eagle river are generally characterized by non standard velocity distributions jarrett 1991 using conventional methods 0 2d 0 8d and 0 6d the estimated mean velocity in the vertical is consistently smaller than the true mean velocity in the vertical subsequently the value of ϕ and h d may differ for open water versus under ice conditions whereas for large river systems characterized by more uniform flow conditions the value of ϕ and h d may be similar for open water and under ice conditions typical velocity distributions for open water and under ice conditions fig 5 are consistent with the findings of chiu and tung 2002 fulton and ostrowski 2008 moramarco et al 2004 crance and frothingham 2008 and healy and hicks 2004 daily mean values of ϕ and h d are summarized in table 2 7 2 1 open water conditions secondary flow currents impact the location and depth of umax depending on the conditions during which the velocity measurement was recorded umax can occur either below eq 7 or at the water surface eq 8 during open water conditions unit values of ϕ varied slightly when compared to daily mean values for example a single vertical profile was used to compute a ϕ value of 0 656 on 07 22 14 whereas 94 measurements aggregated from 00 00 to 23 45 on 10 17 14 resulted in ϕ value of 0 619 by averaging all measurements collected from 09 23 14 through 03 13 15 a ϕ value of 0 607 with a standard deviation of 0 036 was computed for open water conditions table 2 by temporally averaging the 15 min unit values of ϕ and h d derived from the vertical velocity profiles averaging 24 15 min data to produce a daily mean velocity extremes caused by secondary flow currents chiu and tung 2002 and momentum differences related to non zero vertical velocities yang et al 2006 could be reduced these variations are not as prevalent in larger river systems dominated by a more uniform velocity distribution j w fulton and e hittle unpub under ice data 2009 where a single ϕ value was established during the siting phase and used throughout the deployment to forecast discharge regardless of hydraulic variations open water or under ice conditions 7 2 2 under ice conditions during under ice conditions boundary conditions imposed by ice cover fig 6 create a distortion in the velocity distribution where umax invariably occurs below the ice water interface crance and frothingham 2008 unpublished data collected from the red river of the north at grand forks nd usgs 05082500 http dx doi org 10 5066 f7p55kjn from march 2009 to october 2009 suggests a similar velocity distribution developed as presented in fig 5 however a ϕ value of 0 596 was computed for both open water and under ice conditions at grand forks which differs from that observed in the eagle river in contrast the open water 0 656 0 619 and 0 607 and under ice 0 395 0 387 0 383 ϕ values and open water 0 273 and under ice 0 369 0 299 and 0 299 h d values differ for very different flow conditions because h d applies only to conditions where umax occurs below the water surface a value cannot be computed for those times when either h greater than 0 or h 0 the difference in these entropy parameters for open water and under ice conditions may be related to the reduction in the hydraulic depth and accentuated secondary flow currents and non zero vertical velocities that are dominant in small turbulent river systems when compared to larger river systems such as the red river of the north which can be characterized by relatively uniform channel and flow conditions 7 3 comparing conventional and probability concept derived discharges advantages and disadvantages for the purpose of this proof of concept no particular method conventional versus the probability concept was assigned as truth agreement plots index velocity rating versus stage discharge rating and probability concept versus index velocity rating one statistical metric kolmogorov smirnov test ks accessed at http stat ethz ch r manual r devel library stats html ks test html and concurrent discharge measurements provide a measure of comparability between the methods the results offer insights on the advantages and disadvantages of each method regardless of the method stage discharge rating index velocity rating or probability concept comparisons reveal encouraging results depending on the flow conditions and absence presence of ice cover for example the index velocity rating and probability concept returned comparable discharge rates for under ice and low flow conditions however during open water and higher flows the comparisons are less definitive and caution should be used when selecting a particular method probability concept or midsection or instrumentation uadcp and tadcp flowtracker current meter daily and instantaneous discharge time series are presented in figs 7 and 8 discharges derived using the stage discharge rating index velocity rating and probability concept track the advancing and receding limbs of the hydrograph the magnitudes of the stage discharge and index velocity ratings generally derived using non adcp methods are biased low when compared to the probability concept agreement plots are illustrated in figs 9 through 11 during open water periods black dots the comparison between the index velocity and stage discharge ratings fig 9 is poor however the agreement improves with increasing discharge and depth a comparison of the probability concept versus the stage discharge rating fig 10 suggests fair agreement for moderate discharges 1 5 2 0 m3 s however at higher discharges the comparison diverges when comparing the probability concept and the index velocity rating fig 11 agreement at discharges ranging from approximately 0 5 1 m3 s is fair with spread in the data however at higher discharges the agreement degrades it is interesting to note the linearity in the bias at discharges greater than 1 m3 s during under ice periods blue dots figs 9 through 11 all three 3 methods returned similar discharges ranging from approximately 0 5 to 1 0 m3 s it is important to note that each method derives a discharge using very different algorithms and methods therefore it is the discretion of the end user to select the method that is most appropriate for their application during transition periods intermittent open water and under ice and illustrated by the red dots figs 9 through 11 agreement between the stage discharge rating and both index velocity rating and probability concept is poor although the index velocity rating and probability concept exhibit outliers and missing record the comparison is generally favorable fig 11 the ks test returns metrics statistic and p values that allow one to compare the distribution of various populations the two sample ks test is a nonparametric hypothesis test that evaluates the difference between the cumulative distribution functions cdf of two sample data sets the null hypothesis h0 assumes the data are from continuous distributions with equal medians against the alternative hypothesis ha that they are not the ks test results table 3 suggest there is not sufficient information to reject h0 which implies that the probability concept and index velocity rating represent similar distributions during under ice and transition periods however the ks metric suggests none of the three methods yield similar results for open water conditions given the statistical inference associated with the ks metrics it can be concluded that the probability concept and index velocity rating are capable of delivering a real time discharge during under ice and transition conditions conventional and probability concept derived discharges were measured contemporaneously for comparison purposes table 1 six conventional discharge measurements were collected concurrently with probability concept derived discharges with percent differences of 9 0 21 8 6 17 8 3 6 and 2 3 in general the instantaneous probability concept discharges compare favorably to conventional methods differences are larger for those moderate discharges 1 to 2 m3 s where current meters and flowtrackers were used to compute midsection discharges and emphasize the challenges of measuring streamflow in mountain streams that exhibit open water and under ice conditions as stated earlier in this section no one method or result was assumed to represent truth however to provide a measure of uncertainty and in light of recent observations suggesting the stage discharge and index velocity ratings may be improved with the inclusion of adcp measurements the root mean square error rmse in discharge between each of the methods by season was computed the rmse for open water and under ice conditions for the index velocity rating versus the stage discharge rating was 0 32 and 0 07 m3 s respectively the rmse for the probability concept versus the stage discharge was 0 25 and 0 08 m3 s respectively the rmse for the probability concept and the index velocity rating was 0 52 and 0 09 m3 s respectively because of the amount of missing record and uncertainty in the magnitude and extent of frazzle ice or anchor ice the transition period was not included in the analysis the probability concept offers the advantage of 1 providing data that allow a streamgage to be established in a single day 2 reporting discharge based on three variables umax ϕ and area 3 being operational that is transmitting real time data every 15 min 4 accounting for non standard velocity distributions and 5 avoiding the need to collect paired data velocity discharge slope discharge or stage discharge which is based on a range of discharges that can require extensive field work and time for example from november 2014 to january 2015 flow conditions varied from open water to under ice fig 7 where ice periodically forms and breaks up and is influenced by the creation of frazzle and anchor ice ice cover reduces the magnitude of the discharge and effective water depth these temporal changes lead to variations in the water depth ϕ and umax therefore computing discharge based on adcps and the probability concept could be advantageous the disadvantage of the probability concept includes the need to 1 verify the stability of the y axis during various hydraulic extremes and 2 maintain a stage area rating regardless additional field deployments under different hydraulic settings and durations are needed to verify the efficacy of the probability concept index velocity ratings offer the advantage of 1 being operational 2 accepted as a conventional streamgaging method 3 accounting for non standard velocity distributions and 4 reporting discharge based on two variables mean vertical velocity and area the disadvantage of the index velocity rating includes the need to 1 collect paired data which requires extensive field work and time and 2 maintain a stage area rating stage discharge ratings offer the advantage of 1 accepted as a conventional streamgaging method however at ice impacted sites stage discharge ratings are rated poor and are computed after ice breakup using open water reference sites and therefore are not real time in nature 7 4 sources of error the sources of error in measuring under ice discharge can be problematic for water resources managers and other end users open water measurements indicate irregularities at selected vertical velocity profiles based on these findings it is difficult to discern what data represent truth the probability concept is a probabilistic formulation of velocity stage discharge and index velocity ratings are physically based the variables used to compute discharge are common to all three methods and include the cross sectional area and velocity each are subject to uncertainty 7 4 1 cross sectional area the cross sectional area is directly proportional to the computed discharge and is influenced by channel instability associated with sediment transport bank and anchor ice and instrument error a stage area rating was established using an adcp and conventional surveying methods on 07 22 14 and on 03 13 15 the resulting stage area rating differed by 8 percent which was attributed to variations in the exact location of the surveyed cross section and surveyed points in the cross section based on these findings it was assumed that the channel was stable and shift adjustments were not applied to the stage area rating this same rating was used to estimate area as a function of stage during under ice conditions it should be noted that based on the 02 04 15 field visit variations in ice thickness ranged from 0 27 m at the right waters edge to 0 30 m at the left waters edge the maximum ice thickness was 0 52 m approximately 2 7 m west of the uplooking adcps temporal variations in ice thickness may create changes in the cross sectional area which could impose errors in the reported discharge the iq plus is equipped with a primary sensor consisting of a pressure transducer and a vertical acoustic beam which are used to measure stage unfortunately the reflections do not discriminate between an under ice surface and a free water surface variations in the composition of the water such as frazzle ice can distort the reflection an ice detection algorithm is available and is based on the amplitude and signal to noise ratio derived from the velocity profiles however the shallow water depth rendered the algorithm inconclusive pressure flow which can influence discharge computations was not observed during field measurements 7 4 2 velocity the coefficients used to adjust under ice point velocities and needed to compute discharge turnipseed and sauer 2010 rantz et al 1982 terzi 1981 can vary depending on the ice and stream conditions a coefficient of 0 88 walker and wang 1997 used to translate the 0 5d point velocity to a mean vertical velocity for a given vertical was in most instances less than the measured mean vertical velocity because the median adjustment coefficient observed by walker and wang 1997 differs from the generally accepted value of 0 88 for 0 5d use of a single value introduces a systematic bias similarly crance and frothingham 2008 suggest the vertical velocity distribution varies as the roughness of the ice cover changes barrows and horton 1907 report winter flow adjustment coefficients varied considerably from station to station and recommended further investigation by adopting the probability concept there is no need to establish a coefficient with varying hydraulic or ice cover conditions the scatter in the ϕ values may be attributed to secondary flow currents and non zero vertical velocities as a result under ice ϕ values should be computed for a given time stamp to verify these differences and associated scatter additional work is needed this could involve the inclusion of energy and momentum coefficients in the computation of uavg particularly where complex velocity distributions are documented such as that associated with under ice conditions the coefficients are important in the computation of energy gradients water surface profiles and discharge other factors such as the duration at which velocities are sampled and filtering schemes low and high pass filters to better characterize the velocity profile for computing umax and ϕ should be investigated by increasing the sample duration from two minutes to larger averaging times the standard deviation in the velocities recorded by the uadcps should decrease and converge on an expected value this assumes the discharge is not changing dynamically velocity averaging schemes may also impact the amount of filtering needed to reduce noise in the data however a balance between sample averaging and power consumption needs further investigation 8 summary and conclusions computing under ice discharge is important in high elevation high latitude rivers where the winter record is a significant component of the annual water balance however reporting under ice discharge using conventional methods can be problematic a proof of concept was initiated to compute under ice discharges at the usgs streamgage 09064600 eagle river near minturn colorado usa using a variety of hydroacoustic instruments uadcps tadcps and flowtracker coupled with an efficient computational scheme probability concept the results were compared to conventional discharge measurements which included stage discharge and index velocity ratings the probability concept requires that depth and velocity data be collected at a single vertical designated as the y axis in the channel cross section of interest depth and velocity data were collected using uadcps which were installed in september 2014 and operated continuously until march 2015 the entropy parameters ϕ and umax used in the probability concept algorithm were temporally averaged for two minutes and recorded every 15 min discharge was computed by combining these parameters with the stage area rating by temporally averaging the data velocity extremes caused by secondary flow currents and momentum differences related to non zero vertical velocities which are common in shallow high velocity mountain streams such as the eagle river were minimized it should be noted that these velocity variations are not as prevalent in larger river systems dominated by a uniform velocity distribution subsequently the ϕ value established during the siting phase can be used to compute discharge directly regardless of variations in stage or velocity the location of the y axis latitude 39 554181 longitude 106 402155 was assumed to be stable and invariant to changes in stage or discharge this assertion was confirmed by collecting depth and velocity data for various streamflow conditions during open water conditions on 07 22 14 09 22 14 and 03 13 15 and one under ice condition on 02 04 15 conventional and probability concept derived data was collected from september 2014 through march 2015 for the purpose of this proof of concept no particular method stage discharge rating index velocity rating probability concept was assigned as truth therefore the two sample kolmogorov smirnov test was selected to compare the distribution of discharges derived using these various methods assuming a p value of 0 05 the two sample ks test suggests there is not sufficient information to reject h0 which implies that the probability concept and index velocity rating represent similar distributions during under ice and transition periods however the ks metric suggests none of the three methods yield similar results for open water conditions in addition six conventional discharge measurements were collected concurrently with probability concept derived discharges and exhibited differences of 9 0 21 8 6 17 8 3 6 and 2 3 these results suggest that the instantaneous probability concept discharges compare favorably to conventional methods for a variety of streamflow conditions this proof of concept demonstrates that instantaneous discharges can be computed using the probability concept for a range of hydraulic extremes variations in discharge open water and under ice conditions and immediately after the siting phase is complete this is particularly important at sites where new streamgages are planned or at hydraulically complex sites where shifts and corrections are necessary to address changes in cross sectional area a stage area relation must be developed and maintained for the stage discharge rating velocity index rating and probability concept however because the probability concept operates in real time it does not require a history of contemporaneous stage or velocity and discharge measurements over a range of extreme flow conditions to return a discharge

7254,a generalized water table fluctuation model based on precipitation was developed using a statistical conceptualization of unsaturated infiltration fluxes a gamma distribution function was adopted as a transfer function due to its versatility in representing recharge rates with temporally dispersed infiltration fluxes and a laplace transformation was used to obtain an analytical solution to prove the general applicability of the model convergences with previous water table fluctuation models were shown as special cases for validation a few hypothetical cases were developed where the applicability of the model to a wide range of unsaturated zone conditions was confirmed for further validation the model was applied to water table level estimations of three monitoring wells with considerably thick unsaturated zones on jeju island the results show that the developed model represented the pattern of hydrographs from the two monitoring wells fairly well the lag times from precipitation to recharge estimated from the developed system transfer function were found to agree with those from a conventional cross correlation analysis the developed model has the potential to be adopted for the hydraulic characterization of both saturated and unsaturated zones by being calibrated to actual data when extraneous and exogenous causes of water table fluctuation are limited in addition as it provides reference estimates the model can be adopted as a tool for surveilling groundwater resources under hydraulically stressed conditions keywords groundwater fluctuation deep water table aquifer water table level estimation cyber physical system surveilling groundwater resources transfer function 1 introduction water table fluctuations due to precipitation are an obvious yet informative process that can be translated to the subsurface hydraulic characteristics of saturated park et al 2011 and unsaturated zones jeong and park 2017 jeong et al 2017a in the interpretation of subsurface information from water table fluctuation data a model supported reasonably by the corresponding hydraulics and also by the data is a prerequisite due to the importance of a model numerous studies have been conducted to develop physically based models representing water table fluctuations in response to natural i e precipitation and evapotranspiration and anthropogenic i e groundwater abstraction influences bierkens 1998 knotters and bierkens 2000 rai et al 2006 park and parker 2008 cuthbert 2010 jeong and park 2017 in addition to being an instrument for characterizing subsurface hydraulics a water table fluctuation model can be adopted potentially as a tool for the surveillance and management of groundwater resources abnormal changes of groundwater level are often associated with adverse consequences such as depletion konikow and kendy 2005 and inundation kreibich and thieken 2008 that can be alerted in advance and avoided by establishing preemptive measures with the development of information and communication technology ict the surveillance and management actions are expected to become automated and use real time characteristics in such a system e g the cyber physical system cps lee 2008 jeong et al 2017b a model replicating a physical system becomes a key component in which the estimates are continuously compared to monitored data by comparing the observed and estimated water table levels major discrepancies or the hydraulic stress of an aquifer can be observed and reported to decision makers earlier during these events there have been two contrasting approaches in estimating water table fluctuations physically based methods and data driven methods a physically based method is a conventional approach in which the water table fluctuation is estimated from analytical or semi analytical solutions of a linearized boussinesq equation rai et al 2006 cuthbert 2010 numerical solutions to the richards equation neto et al 2015 and solutions to water balance equations bierkens 1998 knotters and bierkens 2000 park and parker 2008 jeong and park 2017 water table fluctuations have been also estimated based on data driven methods that are particularly preferred when the hydrological processes in the subsurface are not necessarily resolved bierkens et al 1999 coulibaly et al 2001 or are unknown in the approaches both linear bierkens et al 1999 knotters and bierkens 2000 and non linear coulibaly et al 2001 coulibaly and baldwin 2005 yoon et al 2011 data driven methods have been adopted although there have been various studies that model water table fluctuations based on analytical and semi analytical methods the hydraulic process of unsaturated gravitational flow i e infiltration is rarely incorporated in the estimations in the majority of those studies infiltration is treated as an instantaneous process in fact the infiltrated water from precipitation generally experiences dispersion on its way to the water table due to spatial heterogeneity and the arrival time at the water table along each flow path varies considerably jeong et al 2017a the temporal variations of the recharge fluxes may be aggravated with preferential flow pathways hendrickx and flury 2001 jarvis et al 2016 which are more than common on an areal scale preferential flow refers to the discrete gravitational flow pathways through a small fraction of the unsaturated zone due to the complexity of the phenomenon and uncertainty about the subsurface the areal infiltration process is difficult to analyze with a deterministic method such as the richards model lehmann et al 2013 and may be treated statistically by assuming independent and identically distributed characteristics of the individual fluxes to alleviate these complexities one may approximate the temporally dispersed recharge fluxes due to a precipitation event by a convolution of a precipitation rate and a transfer function black box model in this approach an idealized statistical function modeling the travel time distribution of recharge fluxes can be employed as the transfer function approximating gravitational drainage during the percolation process transfer function approaches for estimating temporally dispersed recharge fluxes have been studied besbes and de marsily 1984 morel seytoux 1984 wu et al 1997 jeong and park 2017 among these studies besbes and de marsily 1984 and wu et al 1997 use a gamma distribution function as the transfer function to model the travel times of recharge fluxes in contrast jeong and park 2017 use an exponential distribution function to derive a semi analytical solution for water table fluctuation over time by assuming a shallow water table depth despite the mathematical convenience the exponential distribution is a particular case of the gamma distribution which is more versatile in terms of modeling the travel time of recharge fluxes the practical benefit of employing a gamma distribution as the transfer function is that significantly delayed gravitational flow in aquifers with thick overlying unsaturated zones can be represented at the cost of increased dimensionality number of model parameters in the present study a generalized transfer function model for estimating water table fluctuation is developed using a statistical conceptualization of unsaturated infiltration fluxes a semi analytical solution to a water table fluctuation equation park and parker 2008 is developed by adopting a gamma distribution function as the representative model for the dispersed arrival times of individual recharge fluxes to the water table that are unevenly delayed in the unsaturated zone as examples of the generality of the developed solution the convergences of the previously developed solutions to the present solution are analytically proven to demonstrate the model behavior hypothetical cases are developed and applied to the model in addition the model is applied to actual sites that have extremely thick unsaturated zones and the average travel time estimated by the developed model and that by the conventional method are compared 2 methods in the present study the equation given by jeong and park 2017 their eq 6 that is modified from a water budget equation park and parker 2008 their eq 12 is adopted to represent the water table fluctuation in time as 1 dh dt κ h 1 ϕ t 0 r τ f t τ d τ and 2 h t h t h min in these equations κ is the water table recession rate coefficient t 1 given as a positive value park and parker 2008 ϕ is the fillable porosity sophocleous 1991 which is not necessarily identical to drainable porosity acharya et al 2012 r t lt 1 is the potential recharge rate to be translated by the transfer function f t that models the temporal dispersion of infiltration fluxes h t is the discharge potential l indicating additional water level over the minimum groundwater level park and parker 2008 h t is the hydraulic head l h min is the minimum groundwater level l affected by the local hydraulic boundary condition and τ is a variable of integration t corresponding to time t to model the temporal dispersion of the infiltration fluxes in eq 1 the gamma distribution function is given as 3 f t 1 γ k θ k t k 1 exp t θ this is used where γ k is a complete gamma function of k that is a shape parameter inversely related to the skewness of the distribution and θ is a scale parameter the mean and mode of eq 3 are k θ and k 1 θ respectively in the conceptual formulation it is assumed that the individual infiltration fluxes flowing through a stream tube in a region are independent of each other and the temporal dispersion approximately follows the idealized statistical distribution given by eq 3 fig 1 a shows a diagram of the conceptualized infiltration fluxes in a hypothetical unsaturated zone drained vertically by the gravitational force fig 1b shows a few cumulative probability distribution curves computed from the integration of eq 3 with combinations of k and θ as shown in the figures various temporal dispersions of the infiltration fluxes can be represented by a gamma distribution function however more complicated distributions over the range of representation by a gamma distribution function such as bimodal and negatively skewed distributions cannot be modeled by eq 3 these are not considered in the present study the temporal dispersion of infiltration fluxes can be incorporated in numerical models by assigning eq 3 as the transient neumann boundary condition at the water table however in the present study a simpler analytical approach is chosen to develop a water table level estimation method the advantage of an analytical solution is in the simplicity of the computations however more complicated scenarios such as temporally or spatially varying boundary conditions and strongly heterogeneous subsurface material properties are unable to be incorporated by taking an analytical approach to derive a solution for eq 1 based on an infiltration rate transfer function eq 3 with an initial condition of h t 0 0 a laplace transformation can be adopted where eq 3 in the laplace domain is f p 1 θ p k or by using rate parameter α f p α k p α k i e α θ 1 by using the transformed equation based on the rate parameter the solution of eq 1 in the laplace domain is given by 4 h r α k p α k p κ where p is the laplace transform parameter equivalent to t in the time domain if r is a rectangular or box function considering regular measurements of precipitation during a fixed time interval e g the daily precipitation rate the function can be written in the time domain as 5 r r 0 η t η t δ t r 0 0 t δ t 0 ot h erwise where η t is a heaviside step function r 0 is the constant recharge rate lt 1 during the time l δ t t l 1 δ t and δ t is the fixed time interval or length of temporal discretization then based on eq 5 the solution in the laplace domain i e eq 4 can be revised as 6 h r 0 exp lp δ t p exp l 1 p δ t p α k p α k p κ however there is no simple analytical form of the inverse laplace transform of eq 6 and numerical inverse laplace transformation techniques such as the stehfest stehfest 1970 talbot talbot 1979 or de hoog de hoog et al 1982 methods are necessary for the implementation however the methods are numerically unstable for a pulse shaped function in general alternatively for numerical stability purposes one can obtain a semi analytical form by assuming an integer valued shape parameter including zero i e k 0 1 2 as 7 h 1 ϕ t 0 r τ k t τ k κ α d τ where the function k t responsible for the system transfer of recharge flux is given by the analytical formulation 8 k t k κ α α k exp κ t α κ k exp α t n 1 k t k n k n α κ n in contrast to the numerical inverse laplace transformation eq 8 is significantly more stable in terms of computation in the above equation k t k κ α becomes exp κ t when α regardless of the shape parameter k from eqs 7 and 8 for example for k 3 eq 7 becomes h α 3 ϕ t 0 r τ exp κ t α κ 3 exp α t α κ 3 t exp α t α κ 2 t 2 exp α t 2 α κ d τ and for k 2 eq 7 becomes h α 2 ϕ t 0 r τ exp κ t α κ 2 exp α t α κ 2 t exp α t α κ d τ eqs 7 and 8 are degenerated to the previous solutions of park and parker 2008 their eq 14 and jeong and park 2017 their eq 8 by assigning k 0 and 1 respectively which are 9 h 1 ϕ t 0 r τ exp κ t τ d τ and 10 h α ϕ α κ t 0 r τ exp κ t τ exp α t τ d τ where r t needs to be a rectangular function with temporal discretization of δ t for the equivalency to approximate the recharge rate time series a linear combination of rectangular functions is used where a respective weight is the cumulative precipitation during the given time interval between j δ t and j 1 δ t for a recharge rate time series discretized uniformly by δ t an approximated recharge rate function is given by 11 r t j 0 j r j η t j δ t η t j 1 δ t and by applying eq 11 eq 7 becomes 12 h 1 ϕ j 0 j t j δ t r j η t j δ t η t j 1 δ t k t τ d τ where j is the number of days to estimate the water table level in the present study it is assumed that the recharge rate is a constant portion of the precipitation ratio as r j ρ p j where p j is the precipitation rate lt 1 and ρ is the recharge to precipitation ratio in addition it is assumed that ρ is constant for a certain period of time for this reason the developed method may not be applicable to an area with a temperate climate where the recharge to precipitation ratio is highly variable cuthbert 2010 for the demonstration of the developed model the vectorized adaptive quadrature in matlab shampine 2008 based on eq 12 with eq 8 is used for numerical integration and an inverse laplace transformation based on eq 6 is avoided due to the numerical instability associated with a rectangular function because the hydraulic influences imposed by individual precipitation events are independent of each other the implementation of eq 12 can be accelerated by code parallelization 3 verification and discussion 3 1 demonstration of the developed model hypothetical cases fig 2 a shows hypothetical water table level fluctuations over time using the developed model and a few different shape parameters k as described earlier a large k value generally increases the mode and variance of the gamma distribution with a reduction in the skewness for the demonstration the model parameter values of eq 12 are assumed to be κ 0 2 day 1 α 0 21 day 1 ϕ 0 025 ρ 0 5 and h min 100 m for all cases for the hypothetical precipitation data regular interval precipitations at 1 21 41 61 and 81 days with a daily precipitation rate of 0 1 m for 1 day are imposed as explained earlier the shape parameters equivalent to 0 and 1 are identical to the solutions by park and parker 2008 and jeong and park 2017 respectively which show 0 and 4 day delays after precipitation in the water table response for the given case study with relatively short lag times the models proposed by park and parker 2008 and jeong and park 2017 represent the water table fluctuations of shallow unconfined aquifers in which unsaturated gravitational flow takes less than a few days to be percolated from the surface to the water table in contrast in deeper water table aquifers percolation through unsaturated zones can take a significantly longer time and the responses of the water table to precipitation events can be considerably delayed and dispersed over time in this situation the previously developed models are incapable of representing water table fluctuation due to precipitation in theory the developed model in this study can represent delayed and dispersed responses of the water table due to the overlying thick unsaturated zone masking the influence of infiltration the effect of the increasing shape parameter in the gamma distribution function in eq 3 can be confirmed from the shape of the curves with larger k values in fig 2 a with the increasing shape parameter the degree of delay between the precipitation event and the corresponding peak response of the water table increases in addition the dispersion of the curve increases with the shape parameter these observations indicate that the arrival times of recharge fluxes from infiltration are slowed and the infiltrated water experiences more heterogeneous processes resulting in increased dispersion that is modeled effectively by the larger shape parameter using an extreme example of a large shape parameter k 8 in fig 2 a the water table responses from the precipitation events are almost inseparable due to the prolonged arrival times of the recharge fluxes with flattened peaks in contrast to the immediate responses of the water table using the smaller shape parameters k 0 or 1 this observation implies that the developed model can be potentially applicable to deep water table aquifers for the sequential estimation of water table fluctuations based on precipitation time series when recharge patterns and other conditions are consistent with the assumptions of this study fig 2 b shows additional water table fluctuations based on the developed model where the rate parameter inverse of scale parameters θ 1 α of eq 3 varies in the demonstration k 0 2 day 1 ϕ 0 025 ρ 0 5 and h min 100 m are assumed to be constant for all cases whereas the effects of the variable rate parameters equivalent to 0 21 0 5 and 5 day 1 are compared as explained earlier eq 8 asymptotically converges to eq 9 with an increasing α value and the water table responses with α 5 day 1 are almost instantaneously similar to those in park and parker 2008 contrastingly when the α value approaches κ delayed and dispersed water table responses are more pronounced 3 2 applications to actual cases with thick unsaturated zones monitored water table level time series from jeju island 3 2 1 geology and climate of study area jeju island with a massive shield volcano mt halla is the largest volcanic island located off the southwestern coast of the korean peninsula the island has an area of about 1849 km2 the island was created from multiple volcanic eruptions on the continental shelf during the period extending from the pliocene epoch through the neogene period in the cenozoic era with the most recent eruptions occurring about 5000 years ago the geology of jeju island indicates that it is generally composed of igneous and sedimentary rocks the basement rock is granite of jurassic to cretaceous age distributed from 155 m to 312 m below mean sea level msl unconsolidated sediment the u formation with a mean thickness of 150 m is composed of pyroclastic volcanic ashes clay and fine sand and overlays the basement rock the seogwipo formation is above the u formation with a mean thickness of 64 m and composition of pebbly sandstone muddy sand and mud which serves as an aquitard due to its low permeability highly permeable materials basaltic to trachytic volcanic rocks extensively occur on the surface of the island forming mt halla and several hundreds of volcanic cones it is reported that the average hydraulic conductivities of the major aquifers of jeju island are 234 m day for basaltic rocks and 125 m day for trachytic rocks won et al 2005 the center of the island rises up to 1950 m above msl with a steep slope while the rest of the island has a relatively gentle slope down to its periphery jeju island has a temperate climate where the temperatures and precipitation patterns of the northern and southern part of the island show clear differences judging from the data from 1981 through 2010 the annual mean temperature of the northern island is 15 8 6 c while that of the southern island is 16 6 6 7 c the annual mean precipitation rates of the northern and southern island are 1497 6 mm year and 1923 0 mm year respectively and the rate generally increases with increasing topographic elevation won et al 2006 maximum precipitation is recorded in the month of july with a mean precipitation rate of 203 1 mm in contrast minimum precipitation is noted in january with a mean precipitation rate of 30 7 mm although the precipitation rate of the island is approximately 1 5 times larger than that of mainland korea the majority of the streams are ephemeral due to the high permeability of the surface materials and deep water table consequently groundwater is the sole source of fresh water and is regarded as an important water resource accordingly many studies have been conducted on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the groundwater won et al 2005 won et al 2006 mair et al 2013 yoon et al 2017 the soil of jeju island originated from ejecta of the volcano and the majority of the soil types are andisols and inceptisols according to the usda soil taxonomy for highly permeable soils the unsaturated zones all over the island are commonly thick and the thickness generally increases in proportion to surface elevation fig 3 a shows photographs taken at an outcrop that is exposed restrictively on a few cliffs on the western coast of jeju island fig 3 b as shown in the figure the exposed outcrop is constructed by multiple layers of volcanic sediments with sand to gravel size particles where occasional seepages are observed in the layers underlain by locally existing low permeable units representing the unsaturated zone of jeju island 3 2 2 monitoring wells in this study actual water table fluctuation data acquired daily from three observation wells seogwang 2 seogwang 3 and geumak 2 located at 79 9 257 and 311 m above msl respectively are used for validation of the developed method the locations of the monitoring wells are shown in fig 3 b there are no known pumping wells in the immediate vicinity of the monitoring wells and hydraulic interferences due to point sinks sources can be ignored the water table heights measured at each monitoring location are about 25 5 156 5 and 70 m for seogwang 2 seogwang 3 and geumak 2 respectively the thicknesses of the unsaturated zones of seogwang 2 seogwang 3 and geumak 2 monitoring locations are 54 4 100 5 and 241 m respectively the thicknesses of the unsaturated zones are large compared to those in the majority of previous studies furthermore the unsaturated zones include strong vertical heterogeneity due to intricate layering as in fig 3 a therefore the percolation through the section is expected to be complicated and is difficult to be modeled by existing methods the thick unsaturated zones with strong hydrological complexities suggest that the monitoring locations are well suited for the validation of the developed model as it is not restricted to shallow water table aquifers 3 2 3 groundwater data fig 4 a shows the precipitation and water table fluctuation patterns of the seogwang 2 monitoring well from 2009 through 2015 in the figure there are delays between peak precipitation and water table rise to delineate the average travel time of infiltration flux from precipitation to recharge a cross correlation analysis between precipitation and a water table level time series with increasing lag time is conducted based on the analysis it is found that the average travel time of the infiltration flux is roughly 29 days fig 5 a fig 4 b shows the precipitation and water table fluctuation patterns of the seogwang 3 monitoring well from 2010 through 2015 indicating significant delays between peak precipitation and water table rise in addition the water table responses due to precipitation show a smooth curve which suggests a dominant dispersive recharge flux based on a similar cross correlation analysis used for the data from seogwang 2 it is found that the average travel time of the infiltration flux is roughly 74 days fig 5 b the geumak 2 monitoring well also has an unsaturated zone judging from the rounded peaks in fig 4 c which shows water table level data from 2003 through 2016 the delay between precipitation and water table responses is 107 days fig 5 a even longer than those in the seogwang 2 and 3 monitoring wells fig 5 a from a similar cross correlation analysis the almost symmetric water table fluctuation over time is different from typical curves showing immediate sharp peaks with precipitation events and prolonged decay to the positive time in the hydrograph the rounded and almost symmetric water table fluctuation pattern indicates that the recharge process of the geumak 2 monitoring well is particularly slow and the fluxes are strongly dispersive the typically long travel times with dispersion dominating the unsaturated hydraulic processes of the seogwang 2 seogwang 3 and geumak 2 monitoring locations suggest that previous groundwater level estimation methods designed for shallow water table depth conditions do not correspond well with the pattern of the hydrographs 3 2 4 calibration of the developed model to calibrate the developed model based on the data from the seogwang 2 seogwang 3 and geumak 2 monitoring wells a constrained nonlinear local optimization algorithm with the interior point method is used potra and wright 2000 to promote model fitness the following strategy is used 13 α κ ρ ϕ h min argmin α κ ρ ϕ h min j where the parameters with asterisks are optimized and the objective function j is 14 j α κ ρ ϕ h min 1 n i n h i obs h i est 2 in eq 14 h i obs and h i est are the observed and estimated water table levels respectively at the i th discretized time interval where the right hand side is equivalent to the root mean squared error rmse in the optimization the ranges of the model parameters α κ ρ ϕ and h min are specified as in table 1 and α κ is assigned as a condition in the model due to the multiple numerical integration referring to precipitation history as in eq 12 the optimization based on eqs 13 and 14 may be slow and parallel computations are required for the estimation efficiency for this reason an application of the developed model is recommended when no a priori hydrogeological information is available other than the water table level time series if the targeted area is well characterized a numerical model based on richards equation which can account for moisture distribution in time and space is more appropriate the model is initially applied for water table level estimations of the seogwang 2 monitoring well in the estimation the data is separated into two parts where the earlier dataset 2000 days is used for the model calibration and the later 556 days is for the model validation by using eqs 13 and 14 and the earlier dataset the model parameters are obtained and summarized in table 1 to evaluate the model calibration result the rmse of the estimated water table levels and the observed data is computed and equals 0 94 m this value is 7 of the maximum difference of the water table level record 13 43 m in this computation the data points from the initial 300 days 0 through 300 days are excluded in the rmse because precipitation data before year 2009 affecting initial water table level estimations is not available the correlation coefficient of the estimated and observed water table levels is 0 968 for the calibration dataset the high correlation coefficient suggests a strong resemblance between the fluctuation patterns between the estimated and observed water table levels during the calibration period in the estimations for the model validation from 2001 to 2556 days the same parameters obtained from the model calibration period from 1 to 2000 days are adopted the rmse of the estimated water table levels compared to the validation dataset is slightly increased to 1 4 m corresponding to 10 of the maximum difference in the water table level record although the rmse is increased and the correlation coefficient has deteriorated to 0 94 it can be concluded that the calibrated model reasonably represents the water table level fluctuation process for the tested period 556 days conversely if there is an unexpected water table level depression in the observed data the event will be noticed by comparison to the estimated level because the model estimation capability is confirmed by the validation based on the given case seogwang 2 no further validations are pursued in the followed two cases seogwang 3 and geumak 2 based on the optimized shape k rate parameters α and recession rate coefficient κ as summarized in table 1 the system transfer function of eq 8 which explains the arrival time distribution of recharge fluxes is developed as shown in fig 5 b the peak of the transfer function with parameters from the seogwang 2 data is at 35 days although the time of the peak value is unclear for the seogwang 2 dataset in fig 5 a the peak value of the transfer function roughly corresponds to the time for the highest value from the cross correlation analysis 29 days in the preliminary calibration of the model to the seogwang 3 data the later part of the data is constantly overestimated when the model is optimized with the earlier data from this observation it is hypothesized that a period of severe drought during 2013 approximately from 1100 to 1500 days in fig 4 b considerably changes the unsaturated hydraulic condition and the moisture retention pattern with depth when compared to earlier years based on this reasoning two different sets of the optimized model parameters are separately obtained for the pre and post drought periods where the separation time is roughly determined to be about 1400 days when eqs 13 and 14 are applied independently to the two periods it is found that only the recharge to precipitation ratio has a meaningful change table 1 the rmse of the estimated water table levels compared to the observed data is 0 87 m which is 8 of the maximum difference in the water table level record the correlation coefficient is 0 93 the high correlation coefficient indicates a strong resemblance between the fluctuation patterns in the estimated and observed water table levels based on the optimized shape k rate parameters α and recession rate coefficient κ the system transfer function of eq 8 which explains the arrival time distribution of recharge fluxes is developed as shown in fig 5 b the peak of the transfer function with parameters from the seogwang 3 data is at 70 days which is similar to the time for the most correlated peak from the cross correlation analysis described earlier 74 days unlike the previous cases in the geumak 2 data there are occasional depressions in the water table levels around 1500 2600 3000 and 4500 days which are assumed to be anthropogenic the population of jeju island is 621000 and groundwater is the sole source of freshwater on the island roughly 200 million tons of groundwater is abstracted annually for domestic and agricultural use for this reason the hydraulic stress of the aquifer can be aggravated when there is less precipitation than usual in the geumak 2 monitoring well a major process controls the water table fluctuation throughout the observations while a few minor processes potentially anthropogenic have irregular influences on the hydrological system for a limited time therefore it can be stated that the water table level time series from the geumak 2 monitoring well is heteroscedastic for representation of natural water table fluctuations major process by the developed model water table data lower than 67 m are considered artificial and ignored in the calibration from the calibration the optimized model parameters are determined and summarized in table 1 the rmse of the estimations compared to the observed data is 1 84 m which is 14 of the maximum difference in the water table level record considering 67 m as the minimum water table level the correlation coefficient is 0 65 in the application to the geumak 2 data the rmse is higher and the correlation coefficient between the estimated and observed data is lower the lower degree of fitness suggests that the developed model is less suited to the geumak 2 monitoring data compared to those of seogwang 2 and 3 based on the comparisons of the reference estimates by the developed model and the actual observations from guemak 2 monitoring well fig 4 b water table level depressions around 1500 2600 3000 and 4500 days are more prominent which may indicate hydraulic stresses imposed by extraneous or exogenous causes on the underlying aquifer overall it is clear that the calibrated model is not successful in representing the water table fluctuation data from the geumak 2 monitoring well that is heteroscedastic potentially due to artificial influences however there are two factors to be considered in evaluating the degraded model performance the first factor is the anthropogenic intervention in the monitored water table level data although the data related to significant depressions are sorted out in the calibration it is still suspected that water table level changes in several periods originated from artificial causes the other factor is the thickness of the unsaturated zone at geumak 2 which is almost four times and twice the thickness of the seogwang 2 and seogwang 3 zones respectively due to the unsaturated thickness of the geumak 2 aquifer the percolation process through the unsaturated zone could be more pronounced and not represented fully by an idealized probability distribution such as the gamma distribution function described in the model development section based on the optimized shape k rate parameters α and recession rate coefficient κ the transfer function of eq 8 explaining the distribution of recharge flux in time is obtained as in fig 5 b the peak of the transfer function whose parameters are from the geumak 2 data is at 100 days which is close to that delineated from the cross correlation analysis 107 days from the above examples it is found that the developed model estimates reasonably similar water table fluctuations due to precipitation for monitored data at locations with extreme unsaturated thickness the representation of the natural water table level fluctuations leads to the conclusion that the estimates from the developed model can be compared with the actual level for determining the hydraulic stress of an aquifer although a perfect estimation could not be achieved and additional model parameters are incorporated for increased degrees of freedom the similarity of the curves between the estimated and observed water table level time series would not be attainable by applying any of the previous physically based models the remaining model discrepancy with the actual data suggests that there is significant complexity in the infiltration process in the unsaturated zone which may be unresolvable even for other competing approaches the discrepancies could provide valuable information to provide extraneous and exogenous effects that are not considered in model development such as the complexity in unsaturated hydraulic processes climate change or anthropogenic interventions therefore the large discrepancy between the estimated and the observed water table level such as in the case of the geumak 2 monitoring well reveals that further studies to resolve these effects are necessary for further development various key processes influential to water table level need to be identified and incorporated into a model 4 summary and conclusions in the present study a generalized water table fluctuation model based on precipitation is developed based on a water budget equation and a function representing the temporal dispersion of infiltration fluxes to model temporally dispersed infiltration fluxes a gamma distribution function is adopted by the lumped statistical approximation representing many complicated processes in the unsaturated zone for deriving the semi analytical formulation of the water table fluctuation a laplace transformation is used where the precipitation time series is approximated by a linear combination of a rectangular function in the mathematical derivation it is proven that the previous water table fluctuation models are special cases equivalent to k equal to 0 park and parker 2008 and 1 jeong and park 2017 in the developed model for comparisons of the developed and previous models water table level estimations are made from respective models based on several hypothetical cases from the comparisons it is found that the developed model can estimate significantly delayed and dispersed water table fluctuations which is not possible using the previous methods this finding suggests that the developed model is applicable both to shallow and deep water table aquifers for water table level estimations for further validation the model is applied to actual data from three monitoring wells on jeju island seogwang 2 seogwang 3 and geumak 2 where the unsaturated zone is considerably thick the hydrographs of the three monitoring locations suggest that a dispersive recharge process is dominant and precipitation to recharge takes a significantly long time based on the model calibration it is found that the developed model reasonably represents the water table fluctuation pattern of the two monitoring locations in addition the lag time estimations of the data from a cross correlation analysis and those by the developed transfer function agree with only minor differences from these applications it is found that the developed model is limited in its water table level estimation capability when there are extraneous and exogenous causes of water table fluctuation including climate change and anthropogenic influences although precise estimations considering exogenous factors are not available the developed model provides reference estimates assuming unstressed conditions comparable to the actual groundwater level in addition it is found that the idealized statistical function of the gamma distribution is limited and does not include the complexities of the unsaturated hydraulics especially when the unsaturated zone is significantly thick therefore further development is required based on the calibration of the developed model to actual data and the validation the hydraulic characteristics of the subsurface especially for unsaturated zones can be inferred this is not possible using the majority of conventional analytical and semi analytical methods targeting saturated zones in addition the developed model can be adopted as a tool for surveilling groundwater resources in deep water table aquifers by comparing the actual groundwater level to that estimated from the model the hydraulic stress of an aquifer can be determined for further applications however techniques to deal with extraneous and exogenous influences are required and are currently under development acknowledgements the associate software and the sample data used groundwater monitoring and precipitation data

7254,a generalized water table fluctuation model based on precipitation was developed using a statistical conceptualization of unsaturated infiltration fluxes a gamma distribution function was adopted as a transfer function due to its versatility in representing recharge rates with temporally dispersed infiltration fluxes and a laplace transformation was used to obtain an analytical solution to prove the general applicability of the model convergences with previous water table fluctuation models were shown as special cases for validation a few hypothetical cases were developed where the applicability of the model to a wide range of unsaturated zone conditions was confirmed for further validation the model was applied to water table level estimations of three monitoring wells with considerably thick unsaturated zones on jeju island the results show that the developed model represented the pattern of hydrographs from the two monitoring wells fairly well the lag times from precipitation to recharge estimated from the developed system transfer function were found to agree with those from a conventional cross correlation analysis the developed model has the potential to be adopted for the hydraulic characterization of both saturated and unsaturated zones by being calibrated to actual data when extraneous and exogenous causes of water table fluctuation are limited in addition as it provides reference estimates the model can be adopted as a tool for surveilling groundwater resources under hydraulically stressed conditions keywords groundwater fluctuation deep water table aquifer water table level estimation cyber physical system surveilling groundwater resources transfer function 1 introduction water table fluctuations due to precipitation are an obvious yet informative process that can be translated to the subsurface hydraulic characteristics of saturated park et al 2011 and unsaturated zones jeong and park 2017 jeong et al 2017a in the interpretation of subsurface information from water table fluctuation data a model supported reasonably by the corresponding hydraulics and also by the data is a prerequisite due to the importance of a model numerous studies have been conducted to develop physically based models representing water table fluctuations in response to natural i e precipitation and evapotranspiration and anthropogenic i e groundwater abstraction influences bierkens 1998 knotters and bierkens 2000 rai et al 2006 park and parker 2008 cuthbert 2010 jeong and park 2017 in addition to being an instrument for characterizing subsurface hydraulics a water table fluctuation model can be adopted potentially as a tool for the surveillance and management of groundwater resources abnormal changes of groundwater level are often associated with adverse consequences such as depletion konikow and kendy 2005 and inundation kreibich and thieken 2008 that can be alerted in advance and avoided by establishing preemptive measures with the development of information and communication technology ict the surveillance and management actions are expected to become automated and use real time characteristics in such a system e g the cyber physical system cps lee 2008 jeong et al 2017b a model replicating a physical system becomes a key component in which the estimates are continuously compared to monitored data by comparing the observed and estimated water table levels major discrepancies or the hydraulic stress of an aquifer can be observed and reported to decision makers earlier during these events there have been two contrasting approaches in estimating water table fluctuations physically based methods and data driven methods a physically based method is a conventional approach in which the water table fluctuation is estimated from analytical or semi analytical solutions of a linearized boussinesq equation rai et al 2006 cuthbert 2010 numerical solutions to the richards equation neto et al 2015 and solutions to water balance equations bierkens 1998 knotters and bierkens 2000 park and parker 2008 jeong and park 2017 water table fluctuations have been also estimated based on data driven methods that are particularly preferred when the hydrological processes in the subsurface are not necessarily resolved bierkens et al 1999 coulibaly et al 2001 or are unknown in the approaches both linear bierkens et al 1999 knotters and bierkens 2000 and non linear coulibaly et al 2001 coulibaly and baldwin 2005 yoon et al 2011 data driven methods have been adopted although there have been various studies that model water table fluctuations based on analytical and semi analytical methods the hydraulic process of unsaturated gravitational flow i e infiltration is rarely incorporated in the estimations in the majority of those studies infiltration is treated as an instantaneous process in fact the infiltrated water from precipitation generally experiences dispersion on its way to the water table due to spatial heterogeneity and the arrival time at the water table along each flow path varies considerably jeong et al 2017a the temporal variations of the recharge fluxes may be aggravated with preferential flow pathways hendrickx and flury 2001 jarvis et al 2016 which are more than common on an areal scale preferential flow refers to the discrete gravitational flow pathways through a small fraction of the unsaturated zone due to the complexity of the phenomenon and uncertainty about the subsurface the areal infiltration process is difficult to analyze with a deterministic method such as the richards model lehmann et al 2013 and may be treated statistically by assuming independent and identically distributed characteristics of the individual fluxes to alleviate these complexities one may approximate the temporally dispersed recharge fluxes due to a precipitation event by a convolution of a precipitation rate and a transfer function black box model in this approach an idealized statistical function modeling the travel time distribution of recharge fluxes can be employed as the transfer function approximating gravitational drainage during the percolation process transfer function approaches for estimating temporally dispersed recharge fluxes have been studied besbes and de marsily 1984 morel seytoux 1984 wu et al 1997 jeong and park 2017 among these studies besbes and de marsily 1984 and wu et al 1997 use a gamma distribution function as the transfer function to model the travel times of recharge fluxes in contrast jeong and park 2017 use an exponential distribution function to derive a semi analytical solution for water table fluctuation over time by assuming a shallow water table depth despite the mathematical convenience the exponential distribution is a particular case of the gamma distribution which is more versatile in terms of modeling the travel time of recharge fluxes the practical benefit of employing a gamma distribution as the transfer function is that significantly delayed gravitational flow in aquifers with thick overlying unsaturated zones can be represented at the cost of increased dimensionality number of model parameters in the present study a generalized transfer function model for estimating water table fluctuation is developed using a statistical conceptualization of unsaturated infiltration fluxes a semi analytical solution to a water table fluctuation equation park and parker 2008 is developed by adopting a gamma distribution function as the representative model for the dispersed arrival times of individual recharge fluxes to the water table that are unevenly delayed in the unsaturated zone as examples of the generality of the developed solution the convergences of the previously developed solutions to the present solution are analytically proven to demonstrate the model behavior hypothetical cases are developed and applied to the model in addition the model is applied to actual sites that have extremely thick unsaturated zones and the average travel time estimated by the developed model and that by the conventional method are compared 2 methods in the present study the equation given by jeong and park 2017 their eq 6 that is modified from a water budget equation park and parker 2008 their eq 12 is adopted to represent the water table fluctuation in time as 1 dh dt κ h 1 ϕ t

which is not necessarily identical to drainable porosity acharya et al 2012 r t lt 1 is the potential recharge rate to be translated by the transfer function f t that models the temporal dispersion of infiltration fluxes h t is the discharge potential l indicating additional water level over the minimum groundwater level park and parker 2008 h t is the hydraulic head l h min is the minimum groundwater level l affected by the local hydraulic boundary condition and τ is a variable of integration t corresponding to time t to model the temporal dispersion of the infiltration fluxes in eq 1 the gamma distribution function is given as 3 f t 1 γ k θ k t k 1 exp t θ this is used where γ k is a complete gamma function of k that is a shape parameter inversely related to the skewness of the distribution and θ is a scale parameter the mean and mode of eq 3 are k θ and k 1 θ respectively in the conceptual formulation it is assumed that the individual infiltration fluxes flowing through a stream tube in a region are independent of each other and the temporal dispersion approximately follows the idealized statistical distribution given by eq 3 fig 1 a shows a diagram of the conceptualized infiltration fluxes in a hypothetical unsaturated zone drained vertically by the gravitational force fig 1b shows a few cumulative probability distribution curves computed from the integration of eq 3 with combinations of k and θ as shown in the figures various temporal dispersions of the infiltration fluxes can be represented by a gamma distribution function however more complicated distributions over the range of representation by a gamma distribution function such as bimodal and negatively skewed distributions cannot be modeled by eq 3 these are not considered in the present study the temporal dispersion of infiltration fluxes can be incorporated in numerical models by assigning eq 3 as the transient neumann boundary condition at the water table however in the present study a simpler analytical approach is chosen to develop a water table level estimation method the advantage of an analytical solution is in the simplicity of the computations however more complicated scenarios such as temporally or spatially varying boundary conditions and strongly heterogeneous subsurface material properties are unable to be incorporated by taking an analytical approach to derive a solution for eq 1 based on an infiltration rate transfer function eq 3 with an initial condition of h t 0 0 a laplace transformation can be adopted where eq 3 in the laplace domain is f p 1 θ p k or by using rate parameter α f p α k p α k i e α θ 1 by using the transformed equation based on the rate parameter the solution of eq 1 in the laplace domain is given by 4 h r α k p α k p κ where p is the laplace transform parameter equivalent to t in the time domain if r is a rectangular or box function considering regular measurements of precipitation during a fixed time interval e g the daily precipitation rate the function can be written in the time domain as 5 r r 0 η t η t δ t r 0 0 t δ t 0 ot h erwise where η t is a heaviside step function r 0 is the constant recharge rate lt 1 during the time l δ t t l 1 δ t and δ t is the fixed time interval or length of temporal discretization then based on eq 5 the solution in the laplace domain i e eq 4 can be revised as 6 h r 0 exp lp δ t p exp l 1 p δ t p α k p α k p κ however there is no simple analytical form of the inverse laplace transform of eq 6 and numerical inverse laplace transformation techniques such as the stehfest stehfest 1970 talbot talbot 1979 or de hoog de hoog et al 1982 methods are necessary for the implementation however the methods are numerically unstable for a pulse shaped function in general alternatively for numerical stability purposes one can obtain a semi analytical form by assuming an integer valued shape parameter including zero i e k 0 1 2 as 7 h 1 ϕ t 0 r τ k t τ k κ α d τ where the function k t responsible for the system transfer of recharge flux is given by the analytical formulation 8 k t k κ α α k exp κ t α κ k exp α t n 1 k t k n k n α κ n in contrast to the numerical inverse laplace transformation eq 8 is significantly more stable in terms of computation in the above equation k t k κ α becomes exp κ t when α regardless of the shape parameter k from eqs 7 and 8 for example for k 3 eq 7 becomes h α 3 ϕ t 0 r τ exp κ t α κ 3 exp α t α κ 3 t exp α t α κ 2 t 2 exp α t 2 α κ d τ and for k 2 eq 7 becomes h α 2 ϕ t 0 r τ exp κ t α κ 2 exp α t α κ 2 t exp α t α κ d τ eqs 7 and 8 are degenerated to the previous solutions of park and parker 2008 their eq 14 and jeong and park 2017 their eq 8 by assigning k 0 and 1 respectively which are 9 h 1 ϕ t 0 r τ exp κ t τ d τ and 10 h α ϕ α κ t 0 r τ exp κ t τ exp α t τ d τ where r t needs to be a rectangular function with temporal discretization of δ t for the equivalency to approximate the recharge rate time series a linear combination of rectangular functions is used where a respective weight is the cumulative precipitation during the given time interval between j δ t and j 1 δ t for a recharge rate time series discretized uniformly by δ t an approximated recharge rate function is given by 11 r t j 0 j r j η t j δ t η t j 1 δ t and by applying eq 11 eq 7 becomes 12 h 1 ϕ j 0 j t j δ t r j η t j δ t η t j 1 δ t k t τ d τ where j is the number of days to estimate the water table level in the present study it is assumed that the recharge rate is a constant portion of the precipitation ratio as r j ρ p j where p j is the precipitation rate lt 1 and ρ is the recharge to precipitation ratio in addition it is assumed that ρ is constant for a certain period of time for this reason the developed method may not be applicable to an area with a temperate climate where the recharge to precipitation ratio is highly variable cuthbert 2010 for the demonstration of the developed model the vectorized adaptive quadrature in matlab shampine 2008 based on eq 12 with eq 8 is used for numerical integration and an inverse laplace transformation based on eq 6 is avoided due to the numerical instability associated with a rectangular function because the hydraulic influences imposed by individual precipitation events are independent of each other the implementation of eq 12 can be accelerated by code parallelization 3 verification and discussion 3 1 demonstration of the developed model hypothetical cases fig 2 a shows hypothetical water table level fluctuations over time using the developed model and a few different shape parameters k as described earlier a large k value generally increases the mode and variance of the gamma distribution with a reduction in the skewness for the demonstration the model parameter values of eq 12 are assumed to be κ 0 2 day 1 α 0 21 day 1 ϕ 0 025 ρ 0 5 and h min 100 m for all cases for the hypothetical precipitation data regular interval precipitations at 1 21 41 61 and 81 days with a daily precipitation rate of 0 1 m for 1 day are imposed as explained earlier the shape parameters equivalent to 0 and 1 are identical to the solutions by park and parker 2008 and jeong and park 2017 respectively which show 0 and 4 day delays after precipitation in the water table response for the given case study with relatively short lag times the models proposed by park and parker 2008 and jeong and park 2017 represent the water table fluctuations of shallow unconfined aquifers in which unsaturated gravitational flow takes less than a few days to be percolated from the surface to the water table in contrast in deeper water table aquifers percolation through unsaturated zones can take a significantly longer time and the responses of the water table to precipitation events can be considerably delayed and dispersed over time in this situation the previously developed models are incapable of representing water table fluctuation due to precipitation in theory the developed model in this study can represent delayed and dispersed responses of the water table due to the overlying thick unsaturated zone masking the influence of infiltration the effect of the increasing shape parameter in the gamma distribution function in eq 3 can be confirmed from the shape of the curves with larger k values in fig 2 a with the increasing shape parameter the degree of delay between the precipitation event and the corresponding peak response of the water table increases in addition the dispersion of the curve increases with the shape parameter these observations indicate that the arrival times of recharge fluxes from infiltration are slowed and the infiltrated water experiences more heterogeneous processes resulting in increased dispersion that is modeled effectively by the larger shape parameter using an extreme example of a large shape parameter k 8 in fig 2 a the water table responses from the precipitation events are almost inseparable due to the prolonged arrival times of the recharge fluxes with flattened peaks in contrast to the immediate responses of the water table using the smaller shape parameters k 0 or 1 this observation implies that the developed model can be potentially applicable to deep water table aquifers for the sequential estimation of water table fluctuations based on precipitation time series when recharge patterns and other conditions are consistent with the assumptions of this study fig 2 b shows additional water table fluctuations based on the developed model where the rate parameter inverse of scale parameters θ 1 α of eq 3 varies in the demonstration k 0 2 day 1 ϕ 0 025 ρ 0 5 and h min 100 m are assumed to be constant for all cases whereas the effects of the variable rate parameters equivalent to 0 21 0 5 and 5 day 1 are compared as explained earlier eq 8 asymptotically converges to eq 9 with an increasing α value and the water table responses with α 5 day 1 are almost instantaneously similar to those in park and parker 2008 contrastingly when the α value approaches κ delayed and dispersed water table responses are more pronounced 3 2 applications to actual cases with thick unsaturated zones monitored water table level time series from jeju island 3 2 1 geology and climate of study area jeju island with a massive shield volcano mt halla is the largest volcanic island located off the southwestern coast of the korean peninsula the island has an area of about 1849 km2 the island was created from multiple volcanic eruptions on the continental shelf during the period extending from the pliocene epoch through the neogene period in the cenozoic era with the most recent eruptions occurring about 5000 years ago the geology of jeju island indicates that it is generally composed of igneous and sedimentary rocks the basement rock is granite of jurassic to cretaceous age distributed from 155 m to 312 m below mean sea level msl unconsolidated sediment the u formation with a mean thickness of 150 m is composed of pyroclastic volcanic ashes clay and fine sand and overlays the basement rock the seogwipo formation is above the u formation with a mean thickness of 64 m and composition of pebbly sandstone muddy sand and mud which serves as an aquitard due to its low permeability highly permeable materials basaltic to trachytic volcanic rocks extensively occur on the surface of the island forming mt halla and several hundreds of volcanic cones it is reported that the average hydraulic conductivities of the major aquifers of jeju island are 234 m day for basaltic rocks and 125 m day for trachytic rocks won et al 2005 the center of the island rises up to 1950 m above msl with a steep slope while the rest of the island has a relatively gentle slope down to its periphery jeju island has a temperate climate where the temperatures and precipitation patterns of the northern and southern part of the island show clear differences judging from the data from 1981 through 2010 the annual mean temperature of the northern island is 15 8 6 c while that of the southern island is 16 6 6 7 c the annual mean precipitation rates of the northern and southern island are 1497 6 mm year and 1923 0 mm year respectively and the rate generally increases with increasing topographic elevation won et al 2006 maximum precipitation is recorded in the month of july with a mean precipitation rate of 203 1 mm in contrast minimum precipitation is noted in january with a mean precipitation rate of 30 7 mm although the precipitation rate of the island is approximately 1 5 times larger than that of mainland korea the majority of the streams are ephemeral due to the high permeability of the surface materials and deep water table consequently groundwater is the sole source of fresh water and is regarded as an important water resource accordingly many studies have been conducted on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the groundwater won et al 2005 won et al 2006 mair et al 2013 yoon et al 2017 the soil of jeju island originated from ejecta of the volcano and the majority of the soil types are andisols and inceptisols according to the usda soil taxonomy for highly permeable soils the unsaturated zones all over the island are commonly thick and the thickness generally increases in proportion to surface elevation fig 3 a shows photographs taken at an outcrop that is exposed restrictively on a few cliffs on the western coast of jeju island fig 3 b as shown in the figure the exposed outcrop is constructed by multiple layers of volcanic sediments with sand to gravel size particles where occasional seepages are observed in the layers underlain by locally existing low permeable units representing the unsaturated zone of jeju island 3 2 2 monitoring wells in this study actual water table fluctuation data acquired daily from three observation wells seogwang 2 seogwang 3 and geumak 2 located at 79 9 257 and 311 m above msl respectively are used for validation of the developed method the locations of the monitoring wells are shown in fig 3 b there are no known pumping wells in the immediate vicinity of the monitoring wells and hydraulic interferences due to point sinks sources can be ignored the water table heights measured at each monitoring location are about 25 5 156 5 and 70 m for seogwang 2 seogwang 3 and geumak 2 respectively the thicknesses of the unsaturated zones of seogwang 2 seogwang 3 and geumak 2 monitoring locations are 54 4 100 5 and 241 m respectively the thicknesses of the unsaturated zones are large compared to those in the majority of previous studies furthermore the unsaturated zones include strong vertical heterogeneity due to intricate layering as in fig 3 a therefore the percolation through the section is expected to be complicated and is difficult to be modeled by existing methods the thick unsaturated zones with strong hydrological complexities suggest that the monitoring locations are well suited for the validation of the developed model as it is not restricted to shallow water table aquifers 3 2 3 groundwater data fig 4 a shows the precipitation and water table fluctuation patterns of the seogwang 2 monitoring well from 2009 through 2015 in the figure there are delays between peak precipitation and water table rise to delineate the average travel time of infiltration flux from precipitation to recharge a cross correlation analysis between precipitation and a water table level time series with increasing lag time is conducted based on the analysis it is found that the average travel time of the infiltration flux is roughly 29 days fig 5 a fig 4 b shows the precipitation and water table fluctuation patterns of the seogwang 3 monitoring well from 2010 through 2015 indicating significant delays between peak precipitation and water table rise in addition the water table responses due to precipitation show a smooth curve which suggests a dominant dispersive recharge flux based on a similar cross correlation analysis used for the data from seogwang 2 it is found that the average travel time of the infiltration flux is roughly 74 days fig 5 b the geumak 2 monitoring well also has an unsaturated zone judging from the rounded peaks in fig 4 c which shows water table level data from 2003 through 2016 the delay between precipitation and water table responses is 107 days fig 5 a even longer than those in the seogwang 2 and 3 monitoring wells fig 5 a from a similar cross correlation analysis the almost symmetric water table fluctuation over time is different from typical curves showing immediate sharp peaks with precipitation events and prolonged decay to the positive time in the hydrograph the rounded and almost symmetric water table fluctuation pattern indicates that the recharge process of the geumak 2 monitoring well is particularly slow and the fluxes are strongly dispersive the typically long travel times with dispersion dominating the unsaturated hydraulic processes of the seogwang 2 seogwang 3 and geumak 2 monitoring locations suggest that previous groundwater level estimation methods designed for shallow water table depth conditions do not correspond well with the pattern of the hydrographs 3 2 4 calibration of the developed model to calibrate the developed model based on the data from the seogwang 2 seogwang 3 and geumak 2 monitoring wells a constrained nonlinear local optimization algorithm with the interior point method is used potra and wright 2000 to promote model fitness the following strategy is used 13 α κ ρ ϕ h min argmin α κ ρ ϕ h min j where the parameters with asterisks are optimized and the objective function j is 14 j α κ ρ ϕ h min 1 n i n h i obs h i est 2 in eq 14 h i obs and h i est are the observed and estimated water table levels respectively at the i th discretized time interval where the right hand side is equivalent to the root mean squared error rmse in the optimization the ranges of the model parameters α κ ρ ϕ and h min are specified as in table 1 and α κ is assigned as a condition in the model due to the multiple numerical integration referring to precipitation history as in eq 12 the optimization based on eqs 13 and 14 may be slow and parallel computations are required for the estimation efficiency for this reason an application of the developed model is recommended when no a priori hydrogeological information is available other than the water table level time series if the targeted area is well characterized a numerical model based on richards equation which can account for moisture distribution in time and space is more appropriate the model is initially applied for water table level estimations of the seogwang 2 monitoring well in the estimation the data is separated into two parts where the earlier dataset 2000 days is used for the model calibration and the later 556 days is for the model validation by using eqs 13 and 14 and the earlier dataset the model parameters are obtained and summarized in table 1 to evaluate the model calibration result the rmse of the estimated water table levels and the observed data is computed and equals 0 94 m this value is 7 of the maximum difference of the water table level record 13 43 m in this computation the data points from the initial 300 days 0 through 300 days are excluded in the rmse because precipitation data before year 2009 affecting initial water table level estimations is not available the correlation coefficient of the estimated and observed water table levels is 0 968 for the calibration dataset the high correlation coefficient suggests a strong resemblance between the fluctuation patterns between the estimated and observed water table levels during the calibration period in the estimations for the model validation from 2001 to 2556 days the same parameters obtained from the model calibration period from 1 to 2000 days are adopted the rmse of the estimated water table levels compared to the validation dataset is slightly increased to 1 4 m corresponding to 10 of the maximum difference in the water table level record although the rmse is increased and the correlation coefficient has deteriorated to 0 94 it can be concluded that the calibrated model reasonably represents the water table level fluctuation process for the tested period 556 days conversely if there is an unexpected water table level depression in the observed data the event will be noticed by comparison to the estimated level because the model estimation capability is confirmed by the validation based on the given case seogwang 2 no further validations are pursued in the followed two cases seogwang 3 and geumak 2 based on the optimized shape k rate parameters α and recession rate coefficient κ as summarized in table 1 the system transfer function of eq 8 which explains the arrival time distribution of recharge fluxes is developed as shown in fig 5 b the peak of the transfer function with parameters from the seogwang 2 data is at 35 days although the time of the peak value is unclear for the seogwang 2 dataset in fig 5 a the peak value of the transfer function roughly corresponds to the time for the highest value from the cross correlation analysis 29 days in the preliminary calibration of the model to the seogwang 3 data the later part of the data is constantly overestimated when the model is optimized with the earlier data from this observation it is hypothesized that a period of severe drought during 2013 approximately from 1100 to 1500 days in fig 4 b considerably changes the unsaturated hydraulic condition and the moisture retention pattern with depth when compared to earlier years based on this reasoning two different sets of the optimized model parameters are separately obtained for the pre and post drought periods where the separation time is roughly determined to be about 1400 days when eqs 13 and 14 are applied independently to the two periods it is found that only the recharge to precipitation ratio has a meaningful change table 1 the rmse of the estimated water table levels compared to the observed data is 0 87 m which is 8 of the maximum difference in the water table level record the correlation coefficient is 0 93 the high correlation coefficient indicates a strong resemblance between the fluctuation patterns in the estimated and observed water table levels based on the optimized shape k rate parameters α and recession rate coefficient κ the system transfer function of eq 8 which explains the arrival time distribution of recharge fluxes is developed as shown in fig 5 b the peak of the transfer function with parameters from the seogwang 3 data is at 70 days which is similar to the time for the most correlated peak from the cross correlation analysis described earlier 74 days unlike the previous cases in the geumak 2 data there are occasional depressions in the water table levels around 1500 2600 3000 and 4500 days which are assumed to be anthropogenic the population of jeju island is 621000 and groundwater is the sole source of freshwater on the island roughly 200 million tons of groundwater is abstracted annually for domestic and agricultural use for this reason the hydraulic stress of the aquifer can be aggravated when there is less precipitation than usual in the geumak 2 monitoring well a major process controls the water table fluctuation throughout the observations while a few minor processes potentially anthropogenic have irregular influences on the hydrological system for a limited time therefore it can be stated that the water table level time series from the geumak 2 monitoring well is heteroscedastic for representation of natural water table fluctuations major process by the developed model water table data lower than 67 m are considered artificial and ignored in the calibration from the calibration the optimized model parameters are determined and summarized in table 1 the rmse of the estimations compared to the observed data is 1 84 m which is 14 of the maximum difference in the water table level record considering 67 m as the minimum water table level the correlation coefficient is 0 65 in the application to the geumak 2 data the rmse is higher and the correlation coefficient between the estimated and observed data is lower the lower degree of fitness suggests that the developed model is less suited to the geumak 2 monitoring data compared to those of seogwang 2 and 3 based on the comparisons of the reference estimates by the developed model and the actual observations from guemak 2 monitoring well fig 4 b water table level depressions around 1500 2600 3000 and 4500 days are more prominent which may indicate hydraulic stresses imposed by extraneous or exogenous causes on the underlying aquifer overall it is clear that the calibrated model is not successful in representing the water table fluctuation data from the geumak 2 monitoring well that is heteroscedastic potentially due to artificial influences however there are two factors to be considered in evaluating the degraded model performance the first factor is the anthropogenic intervention in the monitored water table level data although the data related to significant depressions are sorted out in the calibration it is still suspected that water table level changes in several periods originated from artificial causes the other factor is the thickness of the unsaturated zone at geumak 2 which is almost four times and twice the thickness of the seogwang 2 and seogwang 3 zones respectively due to the unsaturated thickness of the geumak 2 aquifer the percolation process through the unsaturated zone could be more pronounced and not represented fully by an idealized probability distribution such as the gamma distribution function described in the model development section based on the optimized shape k rate parameters α and recession rate coefficient κ the transfer function of eq 8 explaining the distribution of recharge flux in time is obtained as in fig 5 b the peak of the transfer function whose parameters are from the geumak 2 data is at 100 days which is close to that delineated from the cross correlation analysis 107 days from the above examples it is found that the developed model estimates reasonably similar water table fluctuations due to precipitation for monitored data at locations with extreme unsaturated thickness the representation of the natural water table level fluctuations leads to the conclusion that the estimates from the developed model can be compared with the actual level for determining the hydraulic stress of an aquifer although a perfect estimation could not be achieved and additional model parameters are incorporated for increased degrees of freedom the similarity of the curves between the estimated and observed water table level time series would not be attainable by applying any of the previous physically based models the remaining model discrepancy with the actual data suggests that there is significant complexity in the infiltration process in the unsaturated zone which may be unresolvable even for other competing approaches the discrepancies could provide valuable information to provide extraneous and exogenous effects that are not considered in model development such as the complexity in unsaturated hydraulic processes climate change or anthropogenic interventions therefore the large discrepancy between the estimated and the observed water table level such as in the case of the geumak 2 monitoring well reveals that further studies to resolve these effects are necessary for further development various key processes influential to water table level need to be identified and incorporated into a model 4 summary and conclusions in the present study a generalized water table fluctuation model based on precipitation is developed based on a water budget equation and a function representing the temporal dispersion of infiltration fluxes to model temporally dispersed infiltration fluxes a gamma distribution function is adopted by the lumped statistical approximation representing many complicated processes in the unsaturated zone for deriving the semi analytical formulation of the water table fluctuation a laplace transformation is used where the precipitation time series is approximated by a linear combination of a rectangular function in the mathematical derivation it is proven that the previous water table fluctuation models are special cases equivalent to k equal to 0 park and parker 2008 and 1 jeong and park 2017 in the developed model for comparisons of the developed and previous models water table level estimations are made from respective models based on several hypothetical cases from the comparisons it is found that the developed model can estimate significantly delayed and dispersed water table fluctuations which is not possible using the previous methods this finding suggests that the developed model is applicable both to shallow and deep water table aquifers for water table level estimations for further validation the model is applied to actual data from three monitoring wells on jeju island seogwang 2 seogwang 3 and geumak 2 where the unsaturated zone is considerably thick the hydrographs of the three monitoring locations suggest that a dispersive recharge process is dominant and precipitation to recharge takes a significantly long time based on the model calibration it is found that the developed model reasonably represents the water table fluctuation pattern of the two monitoring locations in addition the lag time estimations of the data from a cross correlation analysis and those by the developed transfer function agree with only minor differences from these applications it is found that the developed model is limited in its water table level estimation capability when there are extraneous and exogenous causes of water table fluctuation including climate change and anthropogenic influences although precise estimations considering exogenous factors are not available the developed model provides reference estimates assuming unstressed conditions comparable to the actual groundwater level in addition it is found that the idealized statistical function of the gamma distribution is limited and does not include the complexities of the unsaturated hydraulics especially when the unsaturated zone is significantly thick therefore further development is required based on the calibration of the developed model to actual data and the validation the hydraulic characteristics of the subsurface especially for unsaturated zones can be inferred this is not possible using the majority of conventional analytical and semi analytical methods targeting saturated zones in addition the developed model can be adopted as a tool for surveilling groundwater resources in deep water table aquifers by comparing the actual groundwater level to that estimated from the model the hydraulic stress of an aquifer can be determined for further applications however techniques to deal with extraneous and exogenous influences are required and are currently under development acknowledgements the associate software and the sample data used groundwater monitoring and precipitation data
