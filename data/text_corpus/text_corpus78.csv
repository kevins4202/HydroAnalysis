390,in recent years several approaches in the field of pollution source identification have been developed to identify the unknown pollution source parameters psp of a river pollution incident these approaches rely on monitoring data which have to be collected in the case of the pollution incident up until now the influence of the often arbitrarily selected monitoring data on the identification results is rarely evaluated nevertheless when considering an inverse problem monitoring data can be of major importance regarding parameter identifiability and the reliable estimation of unknown parameters accordingly in this work the influence of the spatial and temporal monitoring design on the identification of an instantaneous pollutant release is analyzed assuming steady flow conditions an analytical solution of the two dimensional advection dispersion reaction equation is used to model the pollutant transport in the river the mirror image technique is applied to capture no flux conditions across the lateral boundaries parameter identifiability is analyzed using the profile likelihood approach the approach additionally enables the user to determine causes in the case of poor or non identifiability and to derive likelihood based confidence intervals the results imply that the spatial and temporal monitoring design has a significant influence on the identifiability and reliable estimation of psp this work provides an overview of first recommendations to guide the setup of a monitoring campaign in the case of a pollution incident keywords surface water pollution source identification monitoring network design identifiability analysis profile likelihood parameter uncertainty 1 introduction the pollution of surface water bodies is a major problem around the world population and economicgrowth lead to increasing pressure on the available water resources in the last decades thousands of accidental pollution spills and intentional illegal discharges into surface water have occurred all over the world just a few examples are the sandoz chemical spill into the rhine river germany in 1986 the metam sodium spill in the sacramento river usa in 1991 capel et al 1988 the cyanide spill in a tributary of the danube river in 2000 wang et al 1997 the nitrobenzene spill to the songhua river china in 2004 jiang et al 2019 the vedan scandal at the thi vai estuary vietnam uncovered in 2008 nguyen and pham 2012 the mchm chemical spill to the elk river west virgina usa in 2014 whelton et al 2017 or the recent contamination of the kim kim river malaysia in 2019 yap et al 2019 to mitigate the social economical and ecological consequences of a pollution incident a rapid and accurate identification of the spill parameters is necessary in recent years several methods have been successfully developed and applied to identify the unknown parameters depending on the spill characteristics these unknown pollution source parameters psp include the source location the release time and duration as well as the total pollutant mass or the pollution intensity in the literature this inverse problem is often referred to as pollution source identification psi and relies on pollutant concentration measurements collected following the pollution incident one of the most popular methods is the simulation optimization approach in which a pollutant transport model is linked to an optimization algorithm to identify the unknown psp han et al 2014 zhang and xin 2017 parolin et al 2015 jing et al 2018 probabilistic approaches form another group of approaches and include the backward probability method cheng and jia 2010 ghane et al 2016 wang et al 2018 bayesian inference yang et al 2016 guozhen et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 and the geostatistical method boano et al 2005 in contrast to simulation optimization approaches the psp are usually treated as random stochastic variables and probability distribution functions are used for their prediction mazaheri et al 2015 further mathematical approaches using regularization methods like the tikhonov regularization are applied badia and hamdi 2007 mazaheri et al 2015 inverse problems like the identification of psp are often considered ill posed boano et al 2005 wang and liu 2012 this can be attributed among other things to a lack of identifiability in psp identifiability issues have already been encountered and reported by various authors ghane et al 2016 applied the backward probability method to identify psp in a river network if the river network contained multiple branches the method was only able to state potential source locations because multiple pollutant sources inside different branches created similar effects at the monitoring point wang et al 2018 extended previous works to multi point source pollution incidents the authors showed that the accuracy of source identification deteriorates when the number of point sources increases as in the case of ghane et al 2016 different combinations of psp led to a very close objective function value which impairs the accurate identification of psp increasing the number of monitoring stations could improve the identification results in this case even under the consideration of a single instantaneous point source in a river stretch results show that the monitoring design influences the overall identifiability and correct identification of psp han et al 2014 because identifiability is a property of the problem itself it is irrelevant which methodology is used for the identification of psp in the mentioned cases olivier and smyth 2017 the previous works already indicate that for pollution source identification monitoring data form the essential basis for the application of all approaches and can have a significant effect on the identifiability and accurate identification of psp when the observed data do not adequately define the actual contaminant characteristics multiple parameter sets might fit the data amirabdollahian and datta 2013 nevertheless up until now the influence of the often arbitrarily selected monitoring data on the identification results has been rarely evaluated accordingly in this work the influence of the spatial and temporal design of the monitoring network on the identifiability and accurate identification of psp is assessed for the identifiability analysis the profile likelihood approach is applied which is described in detail in section 2 2 the method is able to analyze structural and practical identifiability to reveal sources of non identifiability and to derive likelihood based confidence intervals in this work a hypothetical river stretch is considered to gain basic knowledge regarding parameter identifiability the pollutant transport is modeled using an analytical solution of the 2d advection dispersion reaction equation derived for an instantaneous point source the psp include the longitudinal and lateral source location the release time and the total pollutant mass the pollutant transport model and the parametrization of the considered reference scenario are described in section 2 3 in section 3 1 the calculated profile likelihoods and parameter traces for the reference scenario are presented and discussed to assess if the results can be transferred to any river system section 3 2 includes a comparison of the influence of system and pollutant dependent model parameters on the identifiability of psp including the flow velocity the dispersion coefficients and the decay rate finally in section 3 3 and section 3 4 the influence of the spatial and temporal monitoring design and different monitoring strategies on parameter identifiability and uncertainty is discussed section 4 summarizes the most important results regarding an operational monitoring design in practice the paper concludes with a short summary of results and an outlook in section 5 2 material and methods 2 1 parameter estimation in general a linear or non linear functional relationship between the model output f u θ and the observation data d can be expressed by bard 1974 1 d f u θ ϵ where d d 1 d n t contains a discrete number of measurements f u θ includes the model results in this case the simulated concentrations of the pollutant transport model for a corresponding set of independent variables e g time space u u 1 u n t θ θ 1 θ p is a p dimensional vector of model parameters ϵ ϵ 1 ϵ n t contains the measurement error associated with each observation and n is the total number of measurements overall the inverse problem is concerned with the determination of the unknown model parameters p based on available observations d as briefly discussed in section 1 several methods are available for the estimation of unknown model parameters in this work the simulation optimization approach is adopted which is based on an iterative minimization of a pre defined objective function the objective function measures the agreement between measured data and corresponding model results and its formulation is often based on maximum likelihood ml theory and the corresponding formulation of a likelihood function the likelihood function l θ d can be derived from the joint probability density function for d given a model with parameter values θ bates and watts 1988 under the assumption of statistically independent normally distributed measurement noise ϵ i n 0 σ i 2 the likelihood function has the form carrera and neuman 1986a aster et al 2013 2 l θ d i n p d i θ i n 1 2 π σ i 2 exp d i f u i θ 2 2 σ i 2 when the natural logarithm of the likelihood function is taken one obtains the negative log likelihood function 3 2 ln l θ d i 1 n d i f u i θ σ i 2 c o n s t the maximum likelihood estimator mle is the parameter vector which maximizes the likelihood to improve the numerical evaluation and the optimizer convergence the mle is usually determined by minimizing the negative log likelihood function carrera and neuman 1986a 4 m l e θ arg max θ l θ d arg min θ 2 ln l θ d maximum likelihood estimation has several beneficial theoretical properties ensuring efficient and accurate statistical analyses and is therefore often used for parameter estimation kreutz et al 2015 2 2 identifiability analysis 2 2 1 parameter identifiability in mathematics a problem is considered well posed if a unique solution exists which depends continuously on the data if one of these conditions is violated the problem is termed ill posed according to carrera and neuman 1986b a solution to an inverse problem is non unique when the criterion to be minimized is non convex and therefore exhibits local or global minima at more than one point in the parameter space solution uniqueness is inherently related to the identifiability of considered model parameters parameters are termed non identifiable when different parameter sets lead to the same model response šimůnek and hopmans 2002 in this case the solution to the inverse problem is non unique as different parameter vectors will result in the same value regrading the minimization criterion consequently the inverse problem is considered ill posed parameter non identifiability can have different sources and is often classified into structural and practical non identifiability guillaume et al 2019 the concept of structural identifiability was first introduced by bellman and åström 1970 and addresses the question whether model parameters can in theory be uniquely determined for a given model structure the model structure is defined by its input output relationship including the specified set of input variables e g x y t a lack in structural parameter identifiability can exist if model predictions do not react to changes in the respective parameters missing sensitivity or if parameters compensate each other in their influence on model predictions collinearity brun et al 2001 structural identifiability analysis is usually based on the analysis of model equations and is independent of observational data guillaume et al 2019 nevertheless although necessary structural identifiability is not sufficient to guarantee a reliable identification of model parameters in practice when only a finite amount of noise perturbed measurements are available miao et al 2011 therefore the term practical identifiability has been introduced in the literature practical identifiability is often associated with the quantification of uncertainty in the estimated parameters raue et al 2009 miao et al 2011 marsili libelli et al 2014 according to raue et al 2009 a parameter estimate is termed practically non identifiable if although a unique estimate could be obtained only infinite confidence intervals in the de and or increasing direction of the parameter estimate can be derived large uncertainties can be due to a limited amount or quality of the given monitoring data collected for the given model structure raue et al 2009 this is a practical identifiability problem and a change in the monitoring design i e an improvement in the amount and quality of the data can resolve parameter non identifiability in these cases nevertheless unreliable parameter estimates might also be the result of structural identifiability problems 2 2 2 profile likelihood approach there exist several approaches to determine if the parameters of a model are identifiable comprehensive reviews of different methods can be found for example in walter and pronzato 1996 miao et al 2011 and guillaume et al 2019 one approach is the profile likelihood pl approach which is frequently adopted in systems biology raue et al 2009 kreutz et al 2013 because the pl approach does not pose any restrictions on the algebraic form of the model equations it can also be applied to other research areas raue et al 2014 the pl approach is based on the likelihood function l θ d given in eq 2 after the determination of the mle likelihood profiles for the respective parameters can be calculated as described in detail in raue et al 2009 after an optimal parameter set θ is obtained each parameter θi is profiled by scanning along its axis in both increasing and decreasing direction of the optimized parameter value while the parameter of interest θi is set fixed for every optimization step the other parameters θ j i are re optimized 5 p l θ i min θ j i 2 ln l θ d a threshold in the likelihood profile measured from the mle can be used to compute likelihood based confidence intervals kreutz et al 2013 6 c i p l θ i θ p l θ i 2 ln l θ d δ α 1 the threshold δ α 1 represents the α quantiles of a χ 2 distribution with one degree of freedom a confidence interval of a parameter estimate θ i to a confidence level α signifies that for repeated experiments the true parameter value is located within this interval with probability α maiwald et al 2016 in general likelihood based confidence intervals are preferred over asymptotic confidence intervals when the model is non linear or only a small amount of data is available raue et al 2009 the derived likelihood profiles and confidence intervals can be used to assess both structural and practical parameter identifiability as well as parameter uncertainty 2 3 pollutant transport model in this work it is assumed that the pollutant is released instantaneously from a single point source consequently the pollution spill is described by four parameters including the x and y coordinate of the source location xs and ys the release time ts and the total pollutant mass ms although in practice this is a fairly major assumption this kind of release is in general recommended by jiang et al 2018 for a first trial nevertheless the approach applied in this work can be easily transferred to other source characteristics e g continuous sources or multiple point sources to model the transport and mixing of the pollutant in the river an analytical solution of the advection dispersion reaction equation adre is applied in comparison to a numerical transport model the analytical solution is computationally fast and numerical errors and instabilities due to the spatial and temporal discretization do not occur nevertheless if unsteady flow or more complex river geometries are investigated a numerical transport model is necessary which is further discussed in section 5 in the literature regarding psi the transport and mixing inside the river is often modeled by using the one dimensional 1d adre ghane et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 when applying this equation it has to be considered that immediate mixing in the lateral and vertical direction is assumed thus in practice this equation can only be applied to very narrow and shallow rivers or when observation points are located further away from a potential release location and mixing in lateral and vertical direction has already taken place because the lateral mixing zone can have a considerable length the use of a two dimensional 2d model is recommended jiang et al 2018 for an instantaneous pollution release at time ts with a total pollutant mass ms introduced at a source location specified by its coordinates xs and ys the analytical expression of the 2d adre has the form van genuchten et al 2013 7 c x y t m s 4 h π t d x d y exp x x s v x t 2 4 d x t y y s v y t 2 4 d y t k t where h is the water depth m dx and dy are the dispersion coefficients in x and y direction m2 s 1 vx and vy are the flow velocities in x and y direction m s 1 k is the decay rate s 1 and t t t s s 1 is the time since the pollutant release eq 7 considers an infinite domain in the longitudinal and lateral flow direction nevertheless in reality a further movement of the constituent across the river banks can not take place using eq 7 without lateral boundaries would therefore underestimate the real concentration inside the river to introduce a no flux boundary condition at the lateral boundaries the mirror image technique is used in this work fischer et al 1979 chin 2013 it ensures that the constituent beyond the river bank is reflected back by introducing additional sources also called image sources which balance the mass loss inside the river section usually it is sufficient to only use a small number of mirror reflections fischer et al 1979 based on chin 2013 in this work the number of mirror reflections was set to four on the left and right hand boundary 2 4 monitoring data in this work a discrete number of synthetically generated noise perturbed data is considered monitoring data are derived using the results of the transport model described in section 2 3 and adding a perturbation term for the identifiability analysis a reference scenario is defined having the system and pollutant characteristics shown in table 1 the analytical solution considers a straight river section with no tortuosity a constant rectangular cross sectional profile and steady state in hydrodynamics thus constant values for the longitudinal and lateral flow velocities and dispersion coefficients in respect to both time and space are applied in general vy is set to zero because no significant advective transport takes place in the lateral direction the river depth h is set to 2m when using the 2d adre it is assumed that the pollutant is mixed instantly in the vertical direction if a pollutant with a different density than water e g oil derivative is considered the 3d adre should be applied instead the river width w which is not a direct parameter of eq 7 is used for the placement of image sources an instantaneous pollutant release in the center of the cross section at km 7 is considered here at time 12 00 h a total pollutant mass of 500 kg is introduced into the river the pollutant is considered to be conservative in section 3 2 additionally the influence of a decay rate is evaluated regarding the spatial design of the monitoring network two different configurations are considered in this work these include concentrations measurements at fixed monitoring stations and measurement campaigns along the longitudinal direction of the river for a given point in time both approaches rely on the knowledge that a pollutant release has already occurred further upstream in the river the detection of a potential pollutant release e g early warning system is not part of this study monitoring is only conducted after the information that a pollutant release has occurred somewhere upstream knowledge of a potential release might be derived from the responsible discharger itself from public complaints or available monitoring data grayman and males 2002 2 4 1 fixed monitoring stations in this work the single and combined influence of different monitoring stations on parameter identifiability and uncertainty is analyzed the location of the considered pollutant source and the monitoring stations can be retrieved from fig 1 which includes a schematic representation of the synthetic river section corresponding concentration time series at the monitoring stations are presented in figure s1 of the supplementary material it is assumed that monitoring starts at the considered monitoring stations 4 h before the corresponding maximum pollutant concentration is reached the sampling frequency and duration are set constant to 15 min and 8 h respectively to enable a comparison of different monitoring designs in total 33 observations were used for each monitoring station because less data is generally collected in practice section 3 4 includes an analysis of the influence of the monitoring frequency and duration on psp identification only the monitoring stations b1 and b2 are considered for the analysis of the likelihood profiles of the reference scenario in section 3 1 and the influence of system and pollutant dependent model parameters in section 3 2 the further monitoring stations a1 a2 c1 c2 shown in fig 1 are used in section 3 3 to assess the influence of the spatial monitoring network design on the identifiability of psp 2 4 2 longitudinal measurements for the identification of psp zhang and xin 2017 and yang et al 2016 did not use concentration time series collected at fixed monitoring stations but longitudinal concentration measurements where pollutant concentrations were measured along the longitudinal direction over a very small time period to compare the influence of both data collection approaches on the identifiability of psp additionally longitudinal concentration measurements were considered in the analysis in this work it was assumed that data were collected at three different points in time namely t 1 4 4 h t 2 15 6 h and t 3 26 7 h after the pollutant release the considered times determine the moments where the peak of the pollutant plume arrives at the cross section a b and c respectively for all designs a monitored river section with a total length of 16km and an equidistant discretization of 500m was considered the center of each section was located at the cross section a b and c respectively it was assumed that concentration profiles were taken either close to the bank y o b s 5 m or in the center of the river stretch y o b s 150 m fig 1 corresponding concentration data are presented in figure s2 of the supplementary material in total for every longitudinal measurement series 33 observation data were considered 2 4 3 integration of measurement errors as monitoring data are seldom perfect an error model was used to perturb the simulated concentration data generated by the analytical solution of the 2d adre in this work it was assumed that measurement noise is multiplicative an often applied assumption when concentration data are used cheng and jia 2010 han et al 2014 li et al 2016 8 ϵ i f i θ ϵ r e l with ϵ r e l n 0 σ r e l 2 consequently σi is set to fi θ σrel in eq 2 the relative standard deviation σrel of the measurement noise is set to 0 1 corresponding noise perturbed observation data used in the further analysis are depicted in figure s1 and s2 of the supplementary material in this work a constant value for σrel is used higher values for the relative standard deviation will lead to larger uncertainties in the estimated parameters synthetically generated concentration data can be very small this is not representative of actual monitoring data whose accuracy is influenced by the monitoring device therefore a concentration threshold value cth e g limit of detection is defined concentration data below the predefined value were set to the respective value in this work a value of 10 4 g m 3 was adopted after careful inspection of all considered monitoring data as the chosen value can have an influence on the results it should be chosen with care 2 5 software all calculations were carried out in matlab 2018b for the optimization of parameters the matlab function fminsearchbnd based on the nelder and mead simplex algorithm was employed d errico 2020 the algorithm is a constrained direct method and does not use numerical or analytical gradients of the objective function the following parameter boundaries are used for the estimation of optimal parameter sets and calculation of likelihood profiles xs 0 14000 m ys 0 300 m ts 0 24 h and ms 0 1000 kg in general optimization results have to be handled with care due to the existence of local minima therefore likelihood profiles were carefully inspected after their calculation firstly the mle should be the lowest point in all parameter profiles secondly likelihood profiles should be relatively smooth sudden changes or spikes might be the result of premature convergence of the optimization algorithm in this case it is necessary to repeat profile calculations from different initial values to enhance robustness of the results raue et al 2014 the analytical solution of the 2d adre was implemented based on a vectorized approach resulting in a fast computation of simulated concentrations when a single monitoring station with 33 data points is considered the analytical solution of the 2d adre is computed on average in less than 0 001 s for the calculation of the corresponding likelihood profiles of one scenario on average less than 30 s were needed when using parallel computation for the different likelihood profiles as can be expected the more monitoring data are included in the analysis the higher will be the computational time 3 results and discussion 3 1 identifiability of pollution source parameters in the reference scenario in fig 2 the resulting likelihood profiles of each pollution source parameter psp for the reference scenario defined in section 2 4 are displayed three monitoring configurations are compared considering on the one hand the individual monitoring stations b1 and b2 and on the other hand a combination of both monitoring stations the gray dashed line represents the 95 confidence level in general parameters are termed structurally identifiable if the mle is a unique minimum of the likelihood profile profiles that have a unique minimum but do not cross the confidence threshold in decreasing and or increasing direction are often termed practically non identifiable raue et al 2009 nevertheless as this can also be the result of poor structural identifiability further analysis should be carried out in this case if monitoring data are collected at both monitoring stations b1 and b2 the derived likelihood profiles for the four psp exhibit a unique minimum and exceed the 95 confidence level in both directions resulting in finite confidence intervals in this case the parameters can be termed both structurally and practically identifiable in contrast if only one of the monitoring stations either at the bank or in the center of the cross section is considered the likelihood profiles of the lateral source location ys show a unique minimum when observed in detail but are very flat in decreasing direction additionally for the monitoring station b1 the likelihood profile for the total pollutant mass ms is very flat in decreasing direction leading to significantly wider confidence intervals in comparison to the other monitoring configurations the poor identifiability of the parameters ys and ms under the discussed monitoring configurations is also the reason for the large deviation between real and estimated parameter values for ys and ms reasons for parameter non as well as poor identifiability can be further analyzed by plotting the fixed parameter θi against the re optimized parameters θj this provides an overview of possible parameter interactions and can determine functionally related groups when structurally non identifiable parameters are observed raue et al 2014 a straight horizontal line indicates that no interaction between the correspondent source parameters exists in contrast if the line continuously deviates from zero a change in the parameters θj can at least partially balance a change in the parameter θi in regards to the likelihood function in fig 3 a the traces of ms for the profile calculation of ys are presented considering the individual monitoring stations b1 and b2 for the monitoring station b1 a non linear interaction effect between ys and ms can be observed which explains the poor identifiability of these parameters relating these results to practice if a higher pollutant mass is introduced not in the center but at the river banks due to lateral mixing similar pollutant concentrations could be observed at the monitoring station b1 in contrast for the monitoring station b2 no interaction could be observed between ys and ms in this case the poor identifiability of ys is due to a lack of sensitivity of the model output to changes in the parameter ys in both cases an improvement in data quantity or quality could not improve the identifiability of ys as this is the result of a structural problem due to the defined model input i e the considered monitoring locations the results are in agreement with han et al 2014 who used the simulation optimization approach for the identification of source parameters of an instantaneous pollutant release in the case that the pollution source was located in the center of a cross section and only a single monitoring station in the lateral direction was used the accurate identification of the total pollutant mass ms and the lateral source location ys failed and led to very high errors in the estimated parameters if two or more monitoring stations were considered inside one cross section both parameters could be determined with very small errors the results already imply that the identifiability and reliable estimation of psp is influenced by the monitoring network design parameter interactions between psp can lead to flatter profiles of the likelihood function resulting in poor identifiability and inaccurate estimation of parameters 3 2 influence of system and pollutant dependent model parameters in the further course of this work the influence of the monitoring design will only be analyzed based on a specific river system and pollutant defined in the reference scenario however system and pollutant dependent model parameters as the flow velocity the longitudinal and lateral dispersion coefficients or the decay rate might influence the identifiability of psp to assess if the results obtained in this study can be transferred to other river systems the influence of the mentioned model parameters on the identifiability of psp is analyzed for every considered scenario only one model parameter was changed while the other parameters were held constant two monitoring configurations were considered and maintained for all scenarios including the individual station b2 as well as a combination of the stations b1 and b2 in contrast to the information given in the description of the reference scenario the monitoring duration was extended to 16 h so that the full pollutant concentration profiles were measured for each of the considered scenarios this is especially relevant when the dispersion coefficient is very high or when the flow velocity is small it is noted that in practice this many measurements are unlikely to be available but only in this way different scenarios can be compared independent of the monitoring duration the results are presented in fig 4 to make the scenarios easier to compare instead of showing the full likelihood profile only the mle and the likelihood based confidence intervals for a confidence level of 95 are presented while the solid lines represent the monitoring design consisting of both monitoring stations b1 and b2 for the dashed lines only the monitoring station b2 is taken into account in general very wide confidence intervals represent non or only poorly identifiable parameters a further sign of poor identifiability is a large deviation between the mle and the real parameter value regarding the parameters ys and ms significant changes in the width of the derived confidence intervals can only be observed if the flow velocity vx or the lateral dispersion coefficient dy are modified the accurate identification of ys and ms is dependent on the length of the mixing zone and the associated position of the considered monitoring stations the model parameters vx dy and w affect the total mixing length a decrease in vx or an increase in dy will lead to a decreased length of the mixing zone if dy is changed to 0 1 m2 s 1 the mixing zone has a length of 45 km in this case the monitoring stations b1 and b2 are still located inside the mixing zone as described in section 3 1 if only one monitoring station is considered the confidence interval for ms is very wide due to interaction effects with ys if both monitoring stations are considered both parameters can be determined with relatively small uncertainties the results further show that ys regardless of the considered scenario can only be determined if two monitoring stations are used inside the cross section in the case that dy is set to 1 m2 s 1 or vx to 0 25 m s 1 ys can only be termed poorly identifiable even when two monitoring stations are considered this is explained by the fact that full longitudinal mixing would have occurred even when a release from the bank of the river stretch is considered thus different lateral release locations could not be distinguished anymore at the cross section b for the parameters xs and ts only minor changes can be observed between different scenarios both parameters can be termed identifiable and estimated with high accuracy under the given scenarios slight differences can be observed for changes in the flow velocity vx or the longitudinal dispersion coefficient dx in fig 3b traces of xs and ms for the profile calculation of ts for the reference scenario are shown slight linear interaction effects can be observed between the three parameters in practice a source located a little bit further downstream with a later release time and a higher pollutant mass will lead to a similar concentration profile at the observation stations nevertheless under the given hydrodynamic conditions these effects do not influence parameter identifiability when vx or dx are varied the interaction between xs ts and ms changes in the case that vx is increased the uncertainty in ts slightly decreases while for the other source parameters the opposite is the case in comparison for an increase in dx the uncertainty in all three parameters is slightly reduced the process of dispersion whose strength is represented by the parameter dx is an important process which enables the identifiability of xs and ts in the first place if only advection would be considered infinite combinations would exist for xs and ts which could not be determined separately as already emphasized the presented results are only valid under the specified monitoring configurations which included the monitoring stations b1 and b2 the results have shown that parameter identifiability and uncertainty can be affected by the parametrization of the pollutant transport model nevertheless the model parametrization can not be chosen arbitrarily but depends on the underlying system and pollutant characteristics therefore an identifiability analysis should always be part of the parameter estimation process miao et al 2011 only if parameter identifiability is ensured a reliable estimation of the unknown source parameters can be expected 3 3 influence of the spatial monitoring design up to now only monitoring data collected at the cross section b were considered in the analysis the results have already shown that parameter identifiability is influenced by the monitoring network design in the following section the influence of the spatial monitoring design is further evaluated for the parametrization of the different scenarios the system and pollutant dependent model parameters of the reference scenario table 1 were applied again in the upcoming figures for reasons of better comparison for every scenario not the likelihood profile but the mle and the resulting confidence intervals in both directions are presented 3 3 1 fixed monitoring stations in this section the influence of the number and location of different monitoring stations on the identification of psp is assessed in fig 5 the resulting confidence intervals of the considered monitoring designs are compared regarding the uncertainty in the parameters xs and ts when the cross sections a to c are considered the farther the monitoring station is located away from the source the higher the uncertainty in both parameters this could be confirmed by ghane et al 2016 and wang et al 2018 who observed increasing deviations between estimated and actual psp values the further downstream the monitoring station was located the lateral location of the monitoring station does not seem to significantly influence the results the consideration of two monitoring stations in one cross section can slightly reduce parameter uncertainties the same holds for the consideration of more than one station in the longitudinal direction as already discussed in section 3 1 the parameters ys and ms show poor identifiability under certain monitoring configurations resulting in very wide confidence intervals the lateral source location ys can only be reliably estimated if more than one station is considered in cross section a and b or when multiple stations in the longitudinal direction are incorporated in the monitoring network as explained before the accurate identification of ys is dependent on the lateral mixing length for the reference scenario the estimated mixing length is approx 11 25 km as depicted in fig 1 due to increasing lateral mixing information regarding the identification of ys is lost resulting in increasing uncertainty the further downstream the monitoring station is located although full mixing has already taken place when the pollutant plume arrives at cross section b ys is still identifiable when two monitoring stations are used at the named cross section this might be surprising at first but can be explained by the longer mixing length in case the pollutant is introduced at the river banks in this case the mixing zone would extend up to approx 45 km downstream of the release point thus creating different signals at the two monitoring stations inside the cross section in contrast to a release in the center of the cross section large confidence intervals exist for the monitoring cross section c where full lateral mixing would have already taken place even if a release from the bank of the river stretch is considered regarding the identification of the total pollutant mass ms the opposite can be observed with increasing distance between source location and monitoring station the confidence intervals become more narrow this can be explained by a decreasing interaction effect between ys and ms the consideration of more than one monitoring station only has an influence if full lateral mixing has not taken place yet 3 3 2 longitudinal measurements the derived confidence intervals for the four pollution source parameters when using longitudinal measurements are displayed in fig 6 for the longitudinal source location xs and the release time ts finite confidence intervals can be obtained for all scenarios the closer the time of the measurement to the release time of the pollutant the narrower the confidence intervals the lateral location i e if the monitoring is performed along the center or the river bank has not a significant influence on the results the consideration of an additional measurement campaign further downstream can lead to a slight reduction in the uncertainty of estimated parameters regarding the identifiability of the parameters ys and ms similar conclusions as to the application of fixed monitoring stations can be drawn if only a single longitudinal measurement campaign is performed before full lateral mixing has taken place the total pollutant mass ms can only be identified with large uncertainties measurements later in time can significantly reduce uncertainties especially if these are carried out in the river center instead of the river bank in contrast the lateral source location ys can only be estimated with acceptable uncertainties if at least two measurement campaigns are carried out which should be located at the river bank the results show that both monitoring approaches can be used equally in pollution source identification it has to be considered that in this work it is assumed that data are collected at a single time which is not representative in practice nevertheless for the collection of longitudinal concentration profiles in contrast to fixed monitoring stations a minor amount of time is needed for data collection at fixed monitoring stations the monitoring frequency and duration have to be set according to the system characteristics to prevent the pollutant plume not being detected 3 4 influence of the temporal monitoring design not only the spatial design but also the temporal monitoring design will influence the uncertainty in the estimated parameters in this work the temporal design is evaluated with regard to the monitoring frequency and the start of the monitoring the analysis is based on the monitoring stations b1 and b2 for comparison the reference scenario considers a monitoring frequency of 15 min a start of the monitoring 11 5 h after the release and a total monitoring duration of 8 h for the analysis of the temporal design a monitoring frequency of 30 min and 60 min is considered resulting in a total number of 17 and 9 measurements respectively at each monitoring station additionally the influence of the start time of the monitoring is analyzed here three different points in time are considered including a start of the monitoring 14 5 h 15 5 h and 16 5 h after the initial release of the pollutant the considered times refer to a start of the monitoring when the concentration time series have reached half of their maximum value when the maximum concentration is reached and when the concentration time series have decreased to half of their maximum value in total 21 17 and 13 measurements are considered at each monitoring station for the corresponding start times the results for the analysis of the temporal design are presented in fig 7 regarding the monitoring frequency a decrease in the monitoring frequency leads to increased uncertainties in the estimated parameters this is to be expected as the number of available monitoring data influences the width of the confidence intervals nevertheless all psp can still be estimated with relatively small uncertainties and the mle does not deviate significantly from the real parameter values even if a monitoring frequency of 60 min is used in practice the monitoring frequency has to be chosen according to the hydrodynamic characteristics e g flow velocity longitudinal dispersion a highly advective system will require a higher monitoring frequency to avoid that the pollutant plume might not be detected regarding the start of the monitoring a significant impact can be observed on the mle and the derived confidence intervals of the considered source parameters the later the monitoring starts at the stations b1 and b2 the larger the confidence intervals for the parameters xs ts and ms in contrast for the parameter ys only a minor impact can be observed based on the results it is strongly recommended to start the monitoring before the pollutant plume actually arrives at the considered monitoring stations a reliable estimation of source parameters can only be expected when the complete concentration profile is recorded 4 operational guidelines for the monitoring design given the results of the preceding analysis some practical guidelines for the design of a monitoring network in the case of a pollution incident can be summarized it has to be noted that the considered river stretch represents idealized conditions assuming a straight river section with no tortuosity a rectangular cross section and steady hydrodynamics therefore the given suggestions can only be understood as general guidelines investigating if these also apply in more complex systems should be the task of future research projects regarding the longitudinal source location xs and the release time ts monitoring stations should be located as close as possible to the potential source the monitoring program should therefore be started as soon as possible after detection multiple stations in one cross section or along the longitudinal direction can reduce uncertainties in the estimated parameters the results imply that the location of the monitoring location in the lateral direction does not significantly affect the results under economical considerations a station at the river bank might be more suitable nevertheless it has to made certain that the pollutant can actually be measured there as lateral mixing up to this location might not have taken place yet for the application of longitudinal measurements the same guidelines can be applied the earlier the measurement the more accurate the identification of xs and ts additional measurement campaigns at a later time further downstream can further reduce uncertainties in contrast to the identification of xs and ts the uncertainty in the estimated total pollutant mass ms reduces the further the monitoring station is located away from the source this is due to the interaction with the lateral source location ys if full lateral mixing has not taken place yet measurements should be collected at at least two monitoring stations in one cross section or at multiple stations along the longitudinal direction of the river stretch the same holds for longitudinal measurement campaigns which should be carried out at at least two different points in time the accurate identification of the lateral source location ys is the most difficult as it is connected to the lateral mixing length in practice the identification of ys might often be regarded as negligible nevertheless ys should always be incorporated in the identification process if monitoring stations are still located inside the mixing zone and ys is falsely set constant to a wrong value due to interaction effects errors will be present in the other source parameters especially in ms for an accurate identification of ys monitoring should be started as soon as possible after detection at a minimum of two monitoring stations either located in the lateral or longitudinal direction of the river stretch the given summary already implies that depending on the chosen monitoring design there is a trade off in the accuracy of different source parameters therefore it should be determined beforehand which parameter will be the most important in the identification process most often this will be the longitudinal source location which can be used to identify the responsible polluter on the other hand it might also be necessary to estimate the pollutant mass introduced into the river for the planning of mitigation measures a different monitoring design might be necessary in either of these cases the design of the monitoring network will further depend on economic considerations in general the results imply that the more monitoring data are collected the smaller the uncertainties in the estimated parameters nevertheless economic resources are often limited which results in a trade off between cost and parameter uncertainty when considering an even longer river stretch with high industrial activity along the river banks it might be appropriate to design and install an early warning monitoring network before an actual pollution incident has occurred in groundwater systems several authors have already emphasized the use of scientifically designed monitoring networks for pollution source identification datta et al 2009 amirabdollahian and datta 2013 regarding the application in surface waters telci et al 2009 and park et al 2014 developed optimal monitoring networks for the altamaha river system usa based on the mean detection time and detection probability telci and aral 2011 and lee et al 2018 later applied the designed monitoring networks for pollution source identification in the considered river network results of this study indicate that for the identification of the longitudinal source location xs and the release time ts the detection time might be an appropriate criterion regarding the identification of ms and ys the influence of the mixing length has to be taken into consideration 5 conclusions in the case of a pollution incident the overall aim is the fast and accurate identification of pollution source parameters psp so that the responsible parties can be found and mitigation measures put into action it is desirable that uncertainties in the estimated parameters are as small as possible parameter identifiability and parameter uncertainty are closely related identifiability problems will lead to higher parameter uncertainties or even non identifiable parameters overall the results of this work show that although parameters could be termed structurally identifiable the design of the monitoring network has a significant influence on the reliable estimation of psp depending on the adopted monitoring design interaction effects between different psp can increase leading to higher uncertainties in the estimated parameters the application of the profile likelihood approach is especially useful when the simulation optimization approach is adopted and in contrast to probabilistic methods parameter uncertainties have to be assessed after parameter estimation nevertheless the resulting conclusions can be transferred to all approaches regarding the approach of bayesian inference for convergence of the markov chain it has to be ensured that the posterior probability distribution is proper non identifiable parameters cause the posterior to be non proper berger and bayarri 2004 thus before an mcmc technique can be used securely the user must ensure parameter identifiability raue et al 2013 in this study steady hydrodynamics and a constant geometry of a synthetic river stretch have been considered leading to the simplified application of an analytical solution of the 2d advection dispersion reaction equation at present the authors are investigating how parameter identifiability changes in non steady systems in this case it is necessary to use numerical transport models for the profile likelihood approach a significant number of model runs are necessary in the case of computationally intensive numerical transport models other approaches for the identifiability analysis and for the propagation of uncertainties might be more convenient which are currently investigated promising methods are either based on the calculation and analysis of the covariance matrix or its inverse the fisher information matrix some applications are described in brun et al 2001 marsili libelli and giusti 2008 and freni and mannina 2012 a special case present bidirectional flow systems e g estuaries here the varying flow direction and velocity pose an even bigger challenge in the correct identification of psp a publication of first results regarding the identifiability of psp using a numerical transport model in bidirectional systems is in preparation the results are used to improve the identification of psp in the case of a pollution incident in an estuary as an exemplary case study the thi vai estuary located in one of the core regions of industrial development in south vietnam for which a numerical transport model

390,in recent years several approaches in the field of pollution source identification have been developed to identify the unknown pollution source parameters psp of a river pollution incident these approaches rely on monitoring data which have to be collected in the case of the pollution incident up until now the influence of the often arbitrarily selected monitoring data on the identification results is rarely evaluated nevertheless when considering an inverse problem monitoring data can be of major importance regarding parameter identifiability and the reliable estimation of unknown parameters accordingly in this work the influence of the spatial and temporal monitoring design on the identification of an instantaneous pollutant release is analyzed assuming steady flow conditions an analytical solution of the two dimensional advection dispersion reaction equation is used to model the pollutant transport in the river the mirror image technique is applied to capture no flux conditions across the lateral boundaries parameter identifiability is analyzed using the profile likelihood approach the approach additionally enables the user to determine causes in the case of poor or non identifiability and to derive likelihood based confidence intervals the results imply that the spatial and temporal monitoring design has a significant influence on the identifiability and reliable estimation of psp this work provides an overview of first recommendations to guide the setup of a monitoring campaign in the case of a pollution incident keywords surface water pollution source identification monitoring network design identifiability analysis profile likelihood parameter uncertainty 1 introduction the pollution of surface water bodies is a major problem around the world population and economicgrowth lead to increasing pressure on the available water resources in the last decades thousands of accidental pollution spills and intentional illegal discharges into surface water have occurred all over the world just a few examples are the sandoz chemical spill into the rhine river germany in 1986 the metam sodium spill in the sacramento river usa in 1991 capel et al 1988 the cyanide spill in a tributary of the danube river in 2000 wang et al 1997 the nitrobenzene spill to the songhua river china in 2004 jiang et al 2019 the vedan scandal at the thi vai estuary vietnam uncovered in 2008 nguyen and pham 2012 the mchm chemical spill to the elk river west virgina usa in 2014 whelton et al 2017 or the recent contamination of the kim kim river malaysia in 2019 yap et al 2019 to mitigate the social economical and ecological consequences of a pollution incident a rapid and accurate identification of the spill parameters is necessary in recent years several methods have been successfully developed and applied to identify the unknown parameters depending on the spill characteristics these unknown pollution source parameters psp include the source location the release time and duration as well as the total pollutant mass or the pollution intensity in the literature this inverse problem is often referred to as pollution source identification psi and relies on pollutant concentration measurements collected following the pollution incident one of the most popular methods is the simulation optimization approach in which a pollutant transport model is linked to an optimization algorithm to identify the unknown psp han et al 2014 zhang and xin 2017 parolin et al 2015 jing et al 2018 probabilistic approaches form another group of approaches and include the backward probability method cheng and jia 2010 ghane et al 2016 wang et al 2018 bayesian inference yang et al 2016 guozhen et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 and the geostatistical method boano et al 2005 in contrast to simulation optimization approaches the psp are usually treated as random stochastic variables and probability distribution functions are used for their prediction mazaheri et al 2015 further mathematical approaches using regularization methods like the tikhonov regularization are applied badia and hamdi 2007 mazaheri et al 2015 inverse problems like the identification of psp are often considered ill posed boano et al 2005 wang and liu 2012 this can be attributed among other things to a lack of identifiability in psp identifiability issues have already been encountered and reported by various authors ghane et al 2016 applied the backward probability method to identify psp in a river network if the river network contained multiple branches the method was only able to state potential source locations because multiple pollutant sources inside different branches created similar effects at the monitoring point wang et al 2018 extended previous works to multi point source pollution incidents the authors showed that the accuracy of source identification deteriorates when the number of point sources increases as in the case of ghane et al 2016 different combinations of psp led to a very close objective function value which impairs the accurate identification of psp increasing the number of monitoring stations could improve the identification results in this case even under the consideration of a single instantaneous point source in a river stretch results show that the monitoring design influences the overall identifiability and correct identification of psp han et al 2014 because identifiability is a property of the problem itself it is irrelevant which methodology is used for the identification of psp in the mentioned cases olivier and smyth 2017 the previous works already indicate that for pollution source identification monitoring data form the essential basis for the application of all approaches and can have a significant effect on the identifiability and accurate identification of psp when the observed data do not adequately define the actual contaminant characteristics multiple parameter sets might fit the data amirabdollahian and datta 2013 nevertheless up until now the influence of the often arbitrarily selected monitoring data on the identification results has been rarely evaluated accordingly in this work the influence of the spatial and temporal design of the monitoring network on the identifiability and accurate identification of psp is assessed for the identifiability analysis the profile likelihood approach is applied which is described in detail in section 2 2 the method is able to analyze structural and practical identifiability to reveal sources of non identifiability and to derive likelihood based confidence intervals in this work a hypothetical river stretch is considered to gain basic knowledge regarding parameter identifiability the pollutant transport is modeled using an analytical solution of the 2d advection dispersion reaction equation derived for an instantaneous point source the psp include the longitudinal and lateral source location the release time and the total pollutant mass the pollutant transport model and the parametrization of the considered reference scenario are described in section 2 3 in section 3 1 the calculated profile likelihoods and parameter traces for the reference scenario are presented and discussed to assess if the results can be transferred to any river system section 3 2 includes a comparison of the influence of system and pollutant dependent model parameters on the identifiability of psp including the flow velocity the dispersion coefficients and the decay rate finally in section 3 3 and section 3 4 the influence of the spatial and temporal monitoring design and different monitoring strategies on parameter identifiability and uncertainty is discussed section 4 summarizes the most important results regarding an operational monitoring design in practice the paper concludes with a short summary of results and an outlook in section 5 2 material and methods 2 1 parameter estimation in general a linear or non linear functional relationship between the model output f u θ and the observation data d can be expressed by bard 1974 1 d f u θ ϵ where d d 1 d n t contains a discrete number of measurements f u θ includes the model results in this case the simulated concentrations of the pollutant transport model for a corresponding set of independent variables e g time space u u 1 u n t θ θ 1 θ p is a p dimensional vector of model parameters ϵ ϵ 1 ϵ n t contains the measurement error associated with each observation and n is the total number of measurements overall the inverse problem is concerned with the determination of the unknown model parameters p based on available observations d as briefly discussed in section 1 several methods are available for the estimation of unknown model parameters in this work the simulation optimization approach is adopted which is based on an iterative minimization of a pre defined objective function the objective function measures the agreement between measured data and corresponding model results and its formulation is often based on maximum likelihood ml theory and the corresponding formulation of a likelihood function the likelihood function l θ d can be derived from the joint probability density function for d given a model with parameter values θ bates and watts 1988 under the assumption of statistically independent normally distributed measurement noise ϵ i n 0 σ i 2 the likelihood function has the form carrera and neuman 1986a aster et al 2013 2 l θ d i n p d i θ i n 1 2 π σ i 2 exp d i f u i θ 2 2 σ i 2 when the natural logarithm of the likelihood function is taken one obtains the negative log likelihood function 3 2 ln l θ d i 1 n d i f u i θ σ i 2 c o n s t the maximum likelihood estimator mle is the parameter vector which maximizes the likelihood to improve the numerical evaluation and the optimizer convergence the mle is usually determined by minimizing the negative log likelihood function carrera and neuman 1986a 4 m l e θ arg max θ l θ d arg min θ 2 ln l θ d maximum likelihood estimation has several beneficial theoretical properties ensuring efficient and accurate statistical analyses and is therefore often used for parameter estimation kreutz et al 2015 2 2 identifiability analysis 2 2 1 parameter identifiability in mathematics a problem is considered well posed if a unique solution exists which depends continuously on the data if one of these conditions is violated the problem is termed ill posed according to carrera and neuman 1986b a solution to an inverse problem is non unique when the criterion to be minimized is non convex and therefore exhibits local or global minima at more than one point in the parameter space solution uniqueness is inherently related to the identifiability of considered model parameters parameters are termed non identifiable when different parameter sets lead to the same model response šimůnek and hopmans 2002 in this case the solution to the inverse problem is non unique as different parameter vectors will result in the same value regrading the minimization criterion consequently the inverse problem is considered ill posed parameter non identifiability can have different sources and is often classified into structural and practical non identifiability guillaume et al 2019 the concept of structural identifiability was first introduced by bellman and åström 1970 and addresses the question whether model parameters can in theory be uniquely determined for a given model structure the model structure is defined by its input output relationship including the specified set of input variables e g x y t a lack in structural parameter identifiability can exist if model predictions do not react to changes in the respective parameters missing sensitivity or if parameters compensate each other in their influence on model predictions collinearity brun et al 2001 structural identifiability analysis is usually based on the analysis of model equations and is independent of observational data guillaume et al 2019 nevertheless although necessary structural identifiability is not sufficient to guarantee a reliable identification of model parameters in practice when only a finite amount of noise perturbed measurements are available miao et al 2011 therefore the term practical identifiability has been introduced in the literature practical identifiability is often associated with the quantification of uncertainty in the estimated parameters raue et al 2009 miao et al 2011 marsili libelli et al 2014 according to raue et al 2009 a parameter estimate is termed practically non identifiable if although a unique estimate could be obtained only infinite confidence intervals in the de and or increasing direction of the parameter estimate can be derived large uncertainties can be due to a limited amount or quality of the given monitoring data collected for the given model structure raue et al 2009 this is a practical identifiability problem and a change in the monitoring design i e an improvement in the amount and quality of the data can resolve parameter non identifiability in these cases nevertheless unreliable parameter estimates might also be the result of structural identifiability problems 2 2 2 profile likelihood approach there exist several approaches to determine if the parameters of a model are identifiable comprehensive reviews of different methods can be found for example in walter and pronzato 1996 miao et al 2011 and guillaume et al 2019 one approach is the profile likelihood pl approach which is frequently adopted in systems biology raue et al 2009 kreutz et al 2013 because the pl approach does not pose any restrictions on the algebraic form of the model equations it can also be applied to other research areas raue et al 2014 the pl approach is based on the likelihood function l θ d given in eq 2 after the determination of the mle likelihood profiles for the respective parameters can be calculated as described in detail in raue et al 2009 after an optimal parameter set θ is obtained each parameter θi is profiled by scanning along its axis in both increasing and decreasing direction of the optimized parameter value while the parameter of interest θi is set fixed for every optimization step the other parameters θ j i are re optimized 5 p l θ i min θ j i 2 ln l θ d a threshold in the likelihood profile measured from the mle can be used to compute likelihood based confidence intervals kreutz et al 2013 6 c i p l θ i θ p l θ i 2 ln l θ d δ α 1 the threshold δ α 1 represents the α quantiles of a χ 2 distribution with one degree of freedom a confidence interval of a parameter estimate θ i to a confidence level α signifies that for repeated experiments the true parameter value is located within this interval with probability α maiwald et al 2016 in general likelihood based confidence intervals are preferred over asymptotic confidence intervals when the model is non linear or only a small amount of data is available raue et al 2009 the derived likelihood profiles and confidence intervals can be used to assess both structural and practical parameter identifiability as well as parameter uncertainty 2 3 pollutant transport model in this work it is assumed that the pollutant is released instantaneously from a single point source consequently the pollution spill is described by four parameters including the x and y coordinate of the source location xs and ys the release time ts and the total pollutant mass ms although in practice this is a fairly major assumption this kind of release is in general recommended by jiang et al 2018 for a first trial nevertheless the approach applied in this work can be easily transferred to other source characteristics e g continuous sources or multiple point sources to model the transport and mixing of the pollutant in the river an analytical solution of the advection dispersion reaction equation adre is applied in comparison to a numerical transport model the analytical solution is computationally fast and numerical errors and instabilities due to the spatial and temporal discretization do not occur nevertheless if unsteady flow or more complex river geometries are investigated a numerical transport model is necessary which is further discussed in section 5 in the literature regarding psi the transport and mixing inside the river is often modeled by using the one dimensional 1d adre ghane et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 when applying this equation it has to be considered that immediate mixing in the lateral and vertical direction is assumed thus in practice this equation can only be applied to very narrow and shallow rivers or when observation points are located further away from a potential release location and mixing in lateral and vertical direction has already taken place because the lateral mixing zone can have a considerable length the use of a two dimensional 2d model is recommended jiang et al 2018 for an instantaneous pollution release at time ts with a total pollutant mass ms introduced at a source location specified by its coordinates xs and ys the analytical expression of the 2d adre has the form van genuchten et al 2013 7 c x y t m s 4 h π t d x d y exp x x s v x t 2 4 d x t y y s v y t 2 4 d y t k t where h is the water depth m dx and dy are the dispersion coefficients in x and y direction m2 s 1 vx and vy are the flow velocities in x and y direction m s 1 k is the decay rate s 1 and t t t s s 1 is the time since the pollutant release eq 7 considers an infinite domain in the longitudinal and lateral flow direction nevertheless in reality a further movement of the constituent across the river banks can not take place using eq 7 without lateral boundaries would therefore underestimate the real concentration inside the river to introduce a no flux boundary condition at the lateral boundaries the mirror image technique is used in this work fischer et al 1979 chin 2013 it ensures that the constituent beyond the river bank is reflected back by introducing additional sources also called image sources which balance the mass loss inside the river section usually it is sufficient to only use a small number of mirror reflections fischer et al 1979 based on chin 2013 in this work the number of mirror reflections was set to four on the left and right hand boundary 2 4 monitoring data in this work a discrete number of synthetically generated noise perturbed data is considered monitoring data are derived using the results of the transport model described in section 2 3 and adding a perturbation term for the identifiability analysis a reference scenario is defined having the system and pollutant characteristics shown in table 1 the analytical solution considers a straight river section with no tortuosity a constant rectangular cross sectional profile and steady state in hydrodynamics thus constant values for the longitudinal and lateral flow velocities and dispersion coefficients in respect to both time and space are applied in general vy is set to zero because no significant advective transport takes place in the lateral direction the river depth h is set to 2m when using the 2d adre it is assumed that the pollutant is mixed instantly in the vertical direction if a pollutant with a different density than water e g oil derivative is considered the 3d adre should be applied instead the river width w which is not a direct parameter of eq 7 is used for the placement of image sources an instantaneous pollutant release in the center of the cross section at km 7 is considered here at time 12 00 h a total pollutant mass of 500 kg is introduced into the river the pollutant is considered to be conservative in section 3 2 additionally the influence of a decay rate is evaluated regarding the spatial design of the monitoring network two different configurations are considered in this work these include concentrations measurements at fixed monitoring stations and measurement campaigns along the longitudinal direction of the river for a given point in time both approaches rely on the knowledge that a pollutant release has already occurred further upstream in the river the detection of a potential pollutant release e g early warning system is not part of this study monitoring is only conducted after the information that a pollutant release has occurred somewhere upstream knowledge of a potential release might be derived from the responsible discharger itself from public complaints or available monitoring data grayman and males 2002 2 4 1 fixed monitoring stations in this work the single and combined influence of different monitoring stations on parameter identifiability and uncertainty is analyzed the location of the considered pollutant source and the monitoring stations can be retrieved from fig 1 which includes a schematic representation of the synthetic river section corresponding concentration time series at the monitoring stations are presented in figure s1 of the supplementary material it is assumed that monitoring starts at the considered monitoring stations 4 h before the corresponding maximum pollutant concentration is reached the sampling frequency and duration are set constant to 15 min and 8 h respectively to enable a comparison of different monitoring designs in total 33 observations were used for each monitoring station because less data is generally collected in practice section 3 4 includes an analysis of the influence of the monitoring frequency and duration on psp identification only the monitoring stations b1 and b2 are considered for the analysis of the likelihood profiles of the reference scenario in section 3 1 and the influence of system and pollutant dependent model parameters in section 3 2 the further monitoring stations a1 a2 c1 c2 shown in fig 1 are used in section 3 3 to assess the influence of the spatial monitoring network design on the identifiability of psp 2 4 2 longitudinal measurements for the identification of psp zhang and xin 2017 and yang et al 2016 did not use concentration time series collected at fixed monitoring stations but longitudinal concentration measurements where pollutant concentrations were measured along the longitudinal direction over a very small time period to compare the influence of both data collection approaches on the identifiability of psp additionally longitudinal concentration measurements were considered in the analysis in this work it was assumed that data were collected at three different points in time namely t 1 4 4 h t 2 15 6 h and t 3 26 7 h after the pollutant release the considered times determine the moments where the peak of the pollutant plume arrives at the cross section a b and c respectively for all designs a monitored river section with a total length of 16km and an equidistant discretization of 500m was considered the center of each section was located at the cross section a b and c respectively it was assumed that concentration profiles were taken either close to the bank y o b s 5 m or in the center of the river stretch y o b s 150 m fig 1 corresponding concentration data are presented in figure s2 of the supplementary material in total for every longitudinal measurement series 33 observation data were considered 2 4 3 integration of measurement errors as monitoring data are seldom perfect an error model was used to perturb the simulated concentration data generated by the analytical solution of the 2d adre in this work it was assumed that measurement noise is multiplicative an often applied assumption when concentration data are used cheng and jia 2010 han et al 2014 li et al 2016 8 ϵ i f i θ ϵ r e l with ϵ r e l n 0 σ r e l 2 consequently σi is set to fi θ σrel in eq 2 the relative standard deviation σrel of the measurement noise is set to 0 1 corresponding noise perturbed observation data used in the further analysis are depicted in figure s1 and s2 of the supplementary material in this work a constant value for σrel is used higher values for the relative standard deviation will lead to larger uncertainties in the estimated parameters synthetically generated concentration data can be very small this is not representative of actual monitoring data whose accuracy is influenced by the monitoring device therefore a concentration threshold value cth e g limit of detection is defined concentration data below the predefined value were set to the respective value in this work a value of 10 4 g m 3 was adopted after careful inspection of all considered monitoring data as the chosen value can have an influence on the results it should be chosen with care 2 5 software all calculations were carried out in matlab 2018b for the optimization of parameters the matlab function fminsearchbnd based on the nelder and mead simplex algorithm was employed d errico 2020 the algorithm is a constrained direct method and does not use numerical or analytical gradients of the objective function the following parameter boundaries are used for the estimation of optimal parameter sets and calculation of likelihood profiles xs 0 14000 m ys 0 300 m ts 0 24 h and ms 0 1000 kg in general optimization results have to be handled with care due to the existence of local minima therefore likelihood profiles were carefully inspected after their calculation firstly the mle should be the lowest point in all parameter profiles secondly likelihood profiles should be relatively smooth sudden changes or spikes might be the result of premature convergence of the optimization algorithm in this case it is necessary to repeat profile calculations from different initial values to enhance robustness of the results raue et al 2014 the analytical solution of the 2d adre was implemented based on a vectorized approach resulting in a fast computation of simulated concentrations when a single monitoring station with 33 data points is considered the analytical solution of the 2d adre is computed on average in less than 0 001 s for the calculation of the corresponding likelihood profiles of one scenario on average less than 30 s were needed when using parallel computation for the different likelihood profiles as can be expected the more monitoring data are included in the analysis the higher will be the computational time 3 results and discussion 3 1 identifiability of pollution source parameters in the reference scenario in fig 2 the resulting likelihood profiles of each pollution source parameter psp for the reference scenario defined in section 2 4 are displayed three monitoring configurations are compared considering on the one hand the individual monitoring stations b1 and b2 and on the other hand a combination of both monitoring stations the gray dashed line represents the 95 confidence level in general parameters are termed structurally identifiable if the mle is a unique minimum of the likelihood profile profiles that have a unique minimum but do not cross the confidence threshold in decreasing and or increasing direction are often termed practically non identifiable raue et al 2009 nevertheless as this can also be the result of poor structural identifiability further analysis should be carried out in this case if monitoring data are collected at both monitoring stations b1 and b2 the derived likelihood profiles for the four psp exhibit a unique minimum and exceed the 95 confidence level in both directions resulting in finite confidence intervals in this case the parameters can be termed both structurally and practically identifiable in contrast if only one of the monitoring stations either at the bank or in the center of the cross section is considered the likelihood profiles of the lateral source location ys show a unique minimum when observed in detail but are very flat in decreasing direction additionally for the monitoring station b1 the likelihood profile for the total pollutant mass ms is very flat in decreasing direction leading to significantly wider confidence intervals in comparison to the other monitoring configurations the poor identifiability of the parameters ys and ms under the discussed monitoring configurations is also the reason for the large deviation between real and estimated parameter values for ys and ms reasons for parameter non as well as poor identifiability can be further analyzed by plotting the fixed parameter θi against the re optimized parameters θj this provides an overview of possible parameter interactions and can determine functionally related groups when structurally non identifiable parameters are observed raue et al 2014 a straight horizontal line indicates that no interaction between the correspondent source parameters exists in contrast if the line continuously deviates from zero a change in the parameters θj can at least partially balance a change in the parameter θi in regards to the likelihood function in fig 3 a the traces of ms for the profile calculation of ys are presented considering the individual monitoring stations b1 and b2 for the monitoring station b1 a non linear interaction effect between ys and ms can be observed which explains the poor identifiability of these parameters relating these results to practice if a higher pollutant mass is introduced not in the center but at the river banks due to lateral mixing similar pollutant concentrations could be observed at the monitoring station b1 in contrast for the monitoring station b2 no interaction could be observed between ys and ms in this case the poor identifiability of ys is due to a lack of sensitivity of the model output to changes in the parameter ys in both cases an improvement in data quantity or quality could not improve the identifiability of ys as this is the result of a structural problem due to the defined model input i e the considered monitoring locations the results are in agreement with han et al 2014 who used the simulation optimization approach for the identification of source parameters of an instantaneous pollutant release in the case that the pollution source was located in the center of a cross section and only a single monitoring station in the lateral direction was used the accurate identification of the total pollutant mass ms and the lateral source location ys failed and led to very high errors in the estimated parameters if two or more monitoring stations were considered inside one cross section both parameters could be determined with very small errors the results already imply that the identifiability and reliable estimation of psp is influenced by the monitoring network design parameter interactions between psp can lead to flatter profiles of the likelihood function resulting in poor identifiability and inaccurate estimation of parameters 3 2 influence of system and pollutant dependent model parameters in the further course of this work the influence of the monitoring design will only be analyzed based on a specific river system and pollutant defined in the reference scenario however system and pollutant dependent model parameters as the flow velocity the longitudinal and lateral dispersion coefficients or the decay rate might influence the identifiability of psp to assess if the results obtained in this study can be transferred to other river systems the influence of the mentioned model parameters on the identifiability of psp is analyzed for every considered scenario only one model parameter was changed while the other parameters were held constant two monitoring configurations were considered and maintained for all scenarios including the individual station b2 as well as a combination of the stations b1 and b2 in contrast to the information given in the description of the reference scenario the monitoring duration was extended to 16 h so that the full pollutant concentration profiles were measured for each of the considered scenarios this is especially relevant when the dispersion coefficient is very high or when the flow velocity is small it is noted that in practice this many measurements are unlikely to be available but only in this way different scenarios can be compared independent of the monitoring duration the results are presented in fig 4 to make the scenarios easier to compare instead of showing the full likelihood profile only the mle and the likelihood based confidence intervals for a confidence level of 95 are presented while the solid lines represent the monitoring design consisting of both monitoring stations b1 and b2 for the dashed lines only the monitoring station b2 is taken into account in general very wide confidence intervals represent non or only poorly identifiable parameters a further sign of poor identifiability is a large deviation between the mle and the real parameter value regarding the parameters ys and ms significant changes in the width of the derived confidence intervals can only be observed if the flow velocity vx or the lateral dispersion coefficient dy are modified the accurate identification of ys and ms is dependent on the length of the mixing zone and the associated position of the considered monitoring stations the model parameters vx dy and w affect the total mixing length a decrease in vx or an increase in dy will lead to a decreased length of the mixing zone if dy is changed to 0 1 m2 s 1 the mixing zone has a length of 45 km in this case the monitoring stations b1 and b2 are still located inside the mixing zone as described in section 3 1 if only one monitoring station is considered the confidence interval for ms is very wide due to interaction effects with ys if both monitoring stations are considered both parameters can be determined with relatively small uncertainties the results further show that ys regardless of the considered scenario can only be determined if two monitoring stations are used inside the cross section in the case that dy is set to 1 m2 s 1 or vx to 0 25 m s 1 ys can only be termed poorly identifiable even when two monitoring stations are considered this is explained by the fact that full longitudinal mixing would have occurred even when a release from the bank of the river stretch is considered thus different lateral release locations could not be distinguished anymore at the cross section b for the parameters xs and ts only minor changes can be observed between different scenarios both parameters can be termed identifiable and estimated with high accuracy under the given scenarios slight differences can be observed for changes in the flow velocity vx or the longitudinal dispersion coefficient dx in fig 3b traces of xs and ms for the profile calculation of ts for the reference scenario are shown slight linear interaction effects can be observed between the three parameters in practice a source located a little bit further downstream with a later release time and a higher pollutant mass will lead to a similar concentration profile at the observation stations nevertheless under the given hydrodynamic conditions these effects do not influence parameter identifiability when vx or dx are varied the interaction between xs ts and ms changes in the case that vx is increased the uncertainty in ts slightly decreases while for the other source parameters the opposite is the case in comparison for an increase in dx the uncertainty in all three parameters is slightly reduced the process of dispersion whose strength is represented by the parameter dx is an important process which enables the identifiability of xs and ts in the first place if only advection would be considered infinite combinations would exist for xs and ts which could not be determined separately as already emphasized the presented results are only valid under the specified monitoring configurations which included the monitoring stations b1 and b2 the results have shown that parameter identifiability and uncertainty can be affected by the parametrization of the pollutant transport model nevertheless the model parametrization can not be chosen arbitrarily but depends on the underlying system and pollutant characteristics therefore an identifiability analysis should always be part of the parameter estimation process miao et al 2011 only if parameter identifiability is ensured a reliable estimation of the unknown source parameters can be expected 3 3 influence of the spatial monitoring design up to now only monitoring data collected at the cross section b were considered in the analysis the results have already shown that parameter identifiability is influenced by the monitoring network design in the following section the influence of the spatial monitoring design is further evaluated for the parametrization of the different scenarios the system and pollutant dependent model parameters of the reference scenario table 1 were applied again in the upcoming figures for reasons of better comparison for every scenario not the likelihood profile but the mle and the resulting confidence intervals in both directions are presented 3 3 1 fixed monitoring stations in this section the influence of the number and location of different monitoring stations on the identification of psp is assessed in fig 5 the resulting confidence intervals of the considered monitoring designs are compared regarding the uncertainty in the parameters xs and ts when the cross sections a to c are considered the farther the monitoring station is located away from the source the higher the uncertainty in both parameters this could be confirmed by ghane et al 2016 and wang et al 2018 who observed increasing deviations between estimated and actual psp values the further downstream the monitoring station was located the lateral location of the monitoring station does not seem to significantly influence the results the consideration of two monitoring stations in one cross section can slightly reduce parameter uncertainties the same holds for the consideration of more than one station in the longitudinal direction as already discussed in section 3 1 the parameters ys and ms show poor identifiability under certain monitoring configurations resulting in very wide confidence intervals the lateral source location ys can only be reliably estimated if more than one station is considered in cross section a and b or when multiple stations in the longitudinal direction are incorporated in the monitoring network as explained before the accurate identification of ys is dependent on the lateral mixing length for the reference scenario the estimated mixing length is approx 11 25 km as depicted in fig 1 due to increasing lateral mixing information regarding the identification of ys is lost resulting in increasing uncertainty the further downstream the monitoring station is located although full mixing has already taken place when the pollutant plume arrives at cross section b ys is still identifiable when two monitoring stations are used at the named cross section this might be surprising at first but can be explained by the longer mixing length in case the pollutant is introduced at the river banks in this case the mixing zone would extend up to approx 45 km downstream of the release point thus creating different signals at the two monitoring stations inside the cross section in contrast to a release in the center of the cross section large confidence intervals exist for the monitoring cross section c where full lateral mixing would have already taken place even if a release from the bank of the river stretch is considered regarding the identification of the total pollutant mass ms the opposite can be observed with increasing distance between source location and monitoring station the confidence intervals become more narrow this can be explained by a decreasing interaction effect between ys and ms the consideration of more than one monitoring station only has an influence if full lateral mixing has not taken place yet 3 3 2 longitudinal measurements the derived confidence intervals for the four pollution source parameters when using longitudinal measurements are displayed in fig 6 for the longitudinal source location xs and the release time ts finite confidence intervals can be obtained for all scenarios the closer the time of the measurement to the release time of the pollutant the narrower the confidence intervals the lateral location i e if the monitoring is performed along the center or the river bank has not a significant influence on the results the consideration of an additional measurement campaign further downstream can lead to a slight reduction in the uncertainty of estimated parameters regarding the identifiability of the parameters ys and ms similar conclusions as to the application of fixed monitoring stations can be drawn if only a single longitudinal measurement campaign is performed before full lateral mixing has taken place the total pollutant mass ms can only be identified with large uncertainties measurements later in time can significantly reduce uncertainties especially if these are carried out in the river center instead of the river bank in contrast the lateral source location ys can only be estimated with acceptable uncertainties if at least two measurement campaigns are carried out which should be located at the river bank the results show that both monitoring approaches can be used equally in pollution source identification it has to be considered that in this work it is assumed that data are collected at a single time which is not representative in practice nevertheless for the collection of longitudinal concentration profiles in contrast to fixed monitoring stations a minor amount of time is needed for data collection at fixed monitoring stations the monitoring frequency and duration have to be set according to the system characteristics to prevent the pollutant plume not being detected 3 4 influence of the temporal monitoring design not only the spatial design but also the temporal monitoring design will influence the uncertainty in the estimated parameters in this work the temporal design is evaluated with regard to the monitoring frequency and the start of the monitoring the analysis is based on the monitoring stations b1 and b2 for comparison the reference scenario considers a monitoring frequency of 15 min a start of the monitoring 11 5 h after the release and a total monitoring duration of 8 h for the analysis of the temporal design a monitoring frequency of 30 min and 60 min is considered resulting in a total number of 17 and 9 measurements respectively at each monitoring station additionally the influence of the start time of the monitoring is analyzed here three different points in time are considered including a start of the monitoring 14 5 h 15 5 h and 16 5 h after the initial release of the pollutant the considered times refer to a start of the monitoring when the concentration time series have reached half of their maximum value when the maximum concentration is reached and when the concentration time series have decreased to half of their maximum value in total 21 17 and 13 measurements are considered at each monitoring station for the corresponding start times the results for the analysis of the temporal design are presented in fig 7 regarding the monitoring frequency a decrease in the monitoring frequency leads to increased uncertainties in the estimated parameters this is to be expected as the number of available monitoring data influences the width of the confidence intervals nevertheless all psp can still be estimated with relatively small uncertainties and the mle does not deviate significantly from the real parameter values even if a monitoring frequency of 60 min is used in practice the monitoring frequency has to be chosen according to the hydrodynamic characteristics e g flow velocity longitudinal dispersion a highly advective system will require a higher monitoring frequency to avoid that the pollutant plume might not be detected regarding the start of the monitoring a significant impact can be observed on the mle and the derived confidence intervals of the considered source parameters the later the monitoring starts at the stations b1 and b2 the larger the confidence intervals for the parameters xs ts and ms in contrast for the parameter ys only a minor impact can be observed based on the results it is strongly recommended to start the monitoring before the pollutant plume actually arrives at the considered monitoring stations a reliable estimation of source parameters can only be expected when the complete concentration profile is recorded 4 operational guidelines for the monitoring design given the results of the preceding analysis some practical guidelines for the design of a monitoring network in the case of a pollution incident can be summarized it has to be noted that the considered river stretch represents idealized conditions assuming a straight river section with no tortuosity a rectangular cross section and steady hydrodynamics therefore the given suggestions can only be understood as general guidelines investigating if these also apply in more complex systems should be the task of future research projects regarding the longitudinal source location xs and the release time ts monitoring stations should be located as close as possible to the potential source the monitoring program should therefore be started as soon as possible after detection multiple stations in one cross section or along the longitudinal direction can reduce uncertainties in the estimated parameters the results imply that the location of the monitoring location in the lateral direction does not significantly affect the results under economical considerations a station at the river bank might be more suitable nevertheless it has to made certain that the pollutant can actually be measured there as lateral mixing up to this location might not have taken place yet for the application of longitudinal measurements the same guidelines can be applied the earlier the measurement the more accurate the identification of xs and ts additional measurement campaigns at a later time further downstream can further reduce uncertainties in contrast to the identification of xs and ts the uncertainty in the estimated total pollutant mass ms reduces the further the monitoring station is located away from the source this is due to the interaction with the lateral source location ys if full lateral mixing has not taken place yet measurements should be collected at at least two monitoring stations in one cross section or at multiple stations along the longitudinal direction of the river stretch the same holds for longitudinal measurement campaigns which should be carried out at at least two different points in time the accurate identification of the lateral source location ys is the most difficult as it is connected to the lateral mixing length in practice the identification of ys might often be regarded as negligible nevertheless ys should always be incorporated in the identification process if monitoring stations are still located inside the mixing zone and ys is falsely set constant to a wrong value due to interaction effects errors will be present in the other source parameters especially in ms for an accurate identification of ys monitoring should be started as soon as possible after detection at a minimum of two monitoring stations either located in the lateral or longitudinal direction of the river stretch the given summary already implies that depending on the chosen monitoring design there is a trade off in the accuracy of different source parameters therefore it should be determined beforehand which parameter will be the most important in the identification process most often this will be the longitudinal source location which can be used to identify the responsible polluter on the other hand it might also be necessary to estimate the pollutant mass introduced into the river for the planning of mitigation measures a different monitoring design might be necessary in either of these cases the design of the monitoring network will further depend on economic considerations in general the results imply that the more monitoring data are collected the smaller the uncertainties in the estimated parameters nevertheless economic resources are often limited which results in a trade off between cost and parameter uncertainty when considering an even longer river stretch with high industrial activity along the river banks it might be appropriate to design and install an early warning monitoring network before an actual pollution incident has occurred in groundwater systems several authors have already emphasized the use of scientifically designed monitoring networks for pollution source identification datta et al 2009 amirabdollahian and datta 2013 regarding the application in surface waters telci et al 2009 and park et al 2014 developed optimal monitoring networks for the altamaha river system usa based on the mean detection time and detection probability telci and aral 2011 and lee et al 2018 later applied the designed monitoring networks for pollution source identification in the considered river network results of this study indicate that for the identification of the longitudinal source location xs and the release time ts the detection time might be an appropriate criterion regarding the identification of ms and ys the influence of the mixing length has to be taken into consideration 5 conclusions in the case of a pollution incident the overall aim is the fast and accurate identification of pollution source parameters psp so that the responsible parties can be found and mitigation measures put into action it is desirable that uncertainties in the estimated parameters are as small as possible parameter identifiability and parameter uncertainty are closely related identifiability problems will lead to higher parameter uncertainties or even non identifiable parameters overall the results of this work show that although parameters could be termed structurally identifiable the design of the monitoring network has a significant influence on the reliable estimation of psp depending on the adopted monitoring design interaction effects between different psp can increase leading to higher uncertainties in the estimated parameters the application of the profile likelihood approach is especially useful when the simulation optimization approach is adopted and in contrast to probabilistic methods parameter uncertainties have to be assessed after parameter estimation nevertheless the resulting conclusions can be transferred to all approaches regarding the approach of bayesian inference for convergence of the markov chain it has to be ensured that the posterior probability distribution is proper non identifiable parameters cause the posterior to be non proper berger and bayarri 2004 thus before an mcmc technique can be used securely the user must ensure parameter identifiability raue et al 2013 in this study steady hydrodynamics and a constant geometry of a synthetic river stretch have been considered leading to the simplified application of an analytical solution of the 2d advection dispersion reaction equation at present the authors are investigating how parameter identifiability changes in non steady systems in this case it is necessary to use numerical transport models for the profile likelihood approach a significant number of model runs are necessary in the case of computationally intensive numerical transport models other approaches for the identifiability analysis and for the propagation of uncertainties might be more convenient which are currently investigated promising methods are either based on the calculation and analysis of the covariance matrix or its inverse the fisher information matrix some applications are described in brun et al 2001 marsili libelli and giusti 2008 and freni and mannina 2012 a special case present bidirectional flow systems e g estuaries here the varying flow direction and velocity pose an even bigger challenge in the correct identification of psp a publication of first results regarding the identifiability of psp using a numerical transport model in bidirectional systems is in preparation the results are used to improve the identification of psp in the case of a pollution incident in an estuary as an exemplary case study the thi vai estuary located in one of the core regions of industrial development in south vietnam for which a numerical transport model

391,in this paper laminar flow through and over models of porous media is studied to characterize the flow at the onset of inertia horizontal vertical or mesh arrays of circular rods are used to model the porous medium the rods are arranged to cover solid volume fraction ranging from 0 03 to 0 49 and to fill approximately three quarters of the depth of the test section each of the porous media models is tested in a refractive index matched viscous fluid flow driven by pressure the reynolds number is also varied over an order of magnitude to cover the regime at which the porous medium flow just transitions from a darcy to an inertia laminar flow regime velocity measurements are then obtained by a planar particle image velocimetry technique the experimental data confirms that the averaged transition flow is indeed governed by the brinkman equation if modeled with a new parametrization of the apparent viscosity and modified with an equivalent permeability that accounts for the effects of inertia additionally the results show that at such inertial flows the interfacial region is the porous medium zone affected most by changes in reynolds numbers the data presented in this work provide tools for analytical and numerical validations and the prediction of interfacial flow pertaining to isotropic porous media 1 introduction flow through and over porous media occurs in a variety of natural and industrial applications it is specifically relevant in the consideration of surface or subsurface water resources it is therefore no surprise that the study of this flow has been the subject of several works over several decades despite the progress that has been made in the study of this coupled porous medium free flow problem some fundamental questions about the flow remain foremostly the formulation of transport equations that adequately characterizes the averaged flow behavior in the laminar regime is still an open problem shavit 2009 in one of the first attempts at resolving the problem brinkman 1949 considered the flow as a single volume averaged domain for a unidirectional fluid flow of dynamic viscosity µ averaged streamwise velocity u varying in the transverse direction y an averaged streamwise pressure gradient dp dx across an isotropic porous medium of specific permeability k brinkman 1949 postulated that the flow is governed by an equation that may be expressed as 1 dp dx μ d 2 u d y 2 μ u k an important attribute of this equation is that it was formulated for a non inertial laminar flow regime furthermore it employs an empirically determined apparent or effective viscosity µ to account for the viscous diffusion within the complicated free zone porous medium flow domain while the brinkman equation was initially proposed to study the viscous flow past a dense swarm of spherical particles in a porous mass its application has been extended for a wide range of free zone porous media arrangements additionally it has been verified by several works e g tam 1969 freed and muthukumar 1978 givler and altobelli 1994 other researchers led by beavers and joseph 1967 also considered the problem from quite another perspective they focussed on defining hydrodynamic interfacial boundary conditions between the microscopic free flow governed by the navier stokes equation and the averaged porous medium flow governed by the darcy law or the forchheimer equation the results of that approach have been corroborated in a wide range of theoretical and experimental studies saffman 1971 beavers et al 1974 gupte and advani 1997 chandesris and jamet 2009 however the treatment of the coupled porous medium free flow problem at the onset of inertia using the approach of beaver and joseph 1967 or even that of brinkman 1949 have been relatively few sahraoui and kaviany 1992 ochoa tapia and whitaker 1998 hsu and chang 1990 the brinkman approach in particular has some notable advantages those advantages include the potential to provide accurate predictions of the porous media free zone interfacial boundary layers an adaptability for application for the entire coupled porous medium free flow domain and more importantly the capability to be extended for a wider range of laminar flow conditions those unique utilities of the brinkman approach are the kind required for an accurate assessment of mass and momentum transfer through the flow domain and for other flow assessments at the onset of inertia they have however not been sufficiently explored it is therefore a primary aim of this research study to investigate some of these prospects of the brinkman equation and to employ them in the characterization of the coupled porous medium free flow problem in employing the brinkman approach in this work the modeling of the apparent viscosity is considered as a key requirement to an adequate description of the interfacial flow with or without inertia the modeling of the apparent viscosity has been examined in previous research studies however those studies have resulted in mixed outcomes for instance while some researchers e g koplik et al 1983 have proposed a model of the apparent viscosity to be less than the fluid viscosity others e g kim and russell 1985 have showed that the apparent viscosity is greater than the viscosity of the fluid in this work a rarely used variable apparent viscosity model is presented as a valid and versatile option to the best of this author s knowledge the numerical work of sahraoui and kaviany 1992 is the only work reported in the literature that employs a variable model of the apparent viscosity it appears no other study has pursued any other kind nor verified any with experimental test data an important product of this work then is to present a new variable model of the apparent viscosity of the brinkman equation and to use experimental data to demonstrate its effectiveness in describing the interfacial flow another distinctive feature of this work is that special attention is focussed on the flow phenomena at the onset of inertia this is an important practical consideration giving that several flow applications ranging from flows near well bores or flows through fractures or steady currents running over riverbeds involve flow regimes transitioning to the inertial range as noted the preponderance of related studies appear to be limited to non inertial laminar flows even when some have considered modifications of the brinkman equation for inertial flows e g vafai and tien 1981 hsu and chang 1990 abbasbandy et al 2017 detailed experimental verifications appear to be non existent this work seeks to fill that current gap in the literature by using detail measurement data to characterize the flow at the onset of inertia in undertaking this task of flow characterization periodic arrays of rods are used to model porous media this is a classic model employed in the past by various researchers sahraoui and kaviany 1992 james and davis 2001 arthur et al 2009 this arrangement lends suitability to fundamental flow studies such that the rods may be arranged in the same direction to simulate a two or three dimensional porous media configuration sahraoui and kaviany 1992 james and davis 2001 tachie et al 2004 or two orthogonal directions to simulate a three dimensional brush flow configuration arthur 2012 the relative ease in the use of such models is of immense value in the application of fundamental analyses as well as non intrusive flow measurement techniques at the same time they are useful in simulating real cases such as flows through and over banks of heat exchangers rigid vegetation subject to the fluid flow or an overlying flow associated with woven structures in this work models are achieved using a two dimensional porous medium arrangement and two kinds of three dimensional porous medium arrangement the rods of the models are arrayed to cover a wide range of solid volume fraction ϕ from 0 03 to 0 49 this range covers both loosely packed and compact porous media these models were used in the generation of an extensive data applicable to a wide range of complexity of porous media structures in order to provide substantial support for the analytical model proposed in this work in order to account for the onset of inertial effects the range of bulk reynolds number is also varied from 1 to 10 this reynolds number range is within the scope of laminar flow regime where inertia is expected to be just apparent within the porous medium arthur 2018 in summary then the goal of this work is to characterize the flow through and over porous media problem at the onset of inertia as an integral aspect of the study a brinkman equation of the flow domain is verified this equation is initially based on a hypothesis that at the onset of inertia the momentum equation is a form of an equation by brinkman 1949 with a novel parameterization of the apparent viscosity and the equivalent permeability the hypothesis is tested using detailed velocity measurements obtained from a high resolution planar particle image velocimetry piv technique in a refractive index matched fluid flow section to capture the variations of velocities in the two and three dimensional porous media array multiple streamwise transverse planes are measured at various spanwise locations of the test section these measurements are then averaged over a representative elementary volume to provide volume averages the averaged quantities are subsequently used to characterize the flow through and over the model porous media and to suggest how the flow profile and its parameters may be predicted the analyses are done using equivalent permeability values obtained from finite element comsol multiphysics simulations after verifying the brinkman equation with the test data the parametric values of the associated new apparent viscosity model are obtained and studied further the paper is organized as follows an analysis of the flow problem is first presented in 2 the experimental and numerical approaches are then described in 3 and 4 respectively the research results are subsequently presented and discussed in 5 finally the major conclusions of the work are summarized in 6 2 analysis of the flow problem a schematic diagram of the flow domain is shown in fig 1 in this analysis a steady incompressible laminar flow through and over a homogenous rigid porous medium is considered in this case body forces are neglected at the microscopic level of description microscopic mass and momentum conservation equations may be used to describe the flow in the entire flow section however by applying the same volume averaging over a representative elementary volume throughout the flow domain the scale of description is transformed into a mesoscopic type where a single equivalent medium replaces the fluid and solid phases at such an up scaled description the interfacial zone between the flow domain may be more practically resolved through numerical computations considering the porous medium and the open free zone that description as a continuous heterogenous transition zone with varying flow domain properties jamet et al 2009 furthermore the same volume averaged transport equation is validly applied everywhere as noted in 1 the brinkman equation is a volume averaged momentum equation applicable at a mesoscopic scale in a flow regime where inertia is not a factor in other works e g abbasbandy et al 2017 modifications to the brinkman equation for inertial laminar flows have been suggested notably including an inertial coefficient and the darcy coefficient however in this study it is hypothesized that for a steady state one dimensional flow case directed only in the streamwise x direction by a uniform averaged pressure gradient dp dx an equation similar to the brinkman equation is applicable even at the onset of inertia within the porous medium the equation being a balance of the pressure gradient the divergence of the stress tensor and damping force due to the porous medium is of the form 2 dp dx μ d 2 u d y 2 μ u k v as for eq 1 u is the volume averaged mean filter velocity in the direction of the flow in the porous medium this is specifically a constant mean filter velocity q as the regime of flow in the porous medium of the current analysis is one in which inertia is to be factored an inertial form of the permeability is used instead of the specific permeability in eq 1 this new permeability kv represents the equivalent permeability of the porous medium obtained from the forchheimer 1901 equation expressed by 3 dp dx μ k q κ ρ q 2 1 k 1 κ k ρ q μ μ q μ k v q where κ k ρ are respectively the inertial coefficient darcy specific permeability and fluid density again it is further hypothesized that the flow profile at the edge of the interface being a double sided boundary layer would not significantly deviate from a sigmoidal function with asymptotic values in the porous medium and the free zone arthur 2012 arthur 2019 with that in mind then the sigmoidal solution of 2 for which u a q as y and u b equivalent to the maximum velocity in the free zone as y is of the form 4 u y a b a 1 10 d y p where p and d are unknown factors respectively characterizing the hill slope and the transverse component of the center of the velocity profile this solution is true if 5 μ 10 p d y 1 3 ln 2 10 p 2 10 p d y 1 2 10 p d y k v μ the foregoing hypotheses will be tested experimentally for a wide range of coupled porous medium free flow cases furthermore the nature of empirical factors such as μ and the effects by inertia on the boundary layer parameters will also be probed further as the velocity profile around the interfacial zone is that of a boundary layer some boundary layer parameters can be defined and used to study the flow as affected by inertia following neale and nader 1974 the boundary layer thickness δ may be defined as the transverse distance measured from the interface into the porous medium at which the velocity first decays to within 1 of q i e 1 01q thus at y δ using this definition in eq 4 6 δ 1 p log 10 b q 0 01 q d this boundary layer thickness δ is a measure of the depth of penetration of flow from the free zone into the porous medium the displacement thickness δ and the momentum thickness θ of the boundary layer within the edge of the porous medium may also be respectively expressed by 7 δ 0 u q 1 dy ln 10 dp 1 ln 10 dp b q ln 10 pq 0 δ u q 1 dy and 8 θ 0 u q u q 1 dy b q q b 10 dp 1 ln 10 dp 1 ln 10 dp 1 ln 10 p q 2 10 dp 1 0 δ u q u q 1 dy while eqs 4 to 8 would serve immense benefits in an analytical study their practical utility may be limited by the seemingly unpredictable nature of empirical constants such as p and d however for a macroscopic two domain study made up of a forchheimer porous medium flow and a parallel laminar flow in the free zone it is quite clear from eq 4 that at the interface y 0 the boundary condition at the interface is given by 9 du dy y 0 u b q ln 10 p 10 pd 10 pd 1 u b q β where ub is the slip velocity i e u at y 0 and β is an empirical constant this is similar to the boundary condition suggested by beavers and joseph 1967 if eq 4 holds true then it will confirm the applicability of the beavers and joseph 1967 boundary condition at the onset of inertia more importantly the question of the practical determination of β from global bulk flow measurements can be resolved as follows for a fully developed poiseuille flow in the free zone given by 10 d p d x μ 2 u y 2 and the porous medium flow governed by the forchheimer equation expressed in eq 3 if continuity in velocity and stress is allowed at the interface then by considering the no slip upper wall boundary condition u 0 at y h top and the interfacial boundary condition in eq 9 the flow in the free zone y 0 may be expressed as 11 u y 1 2 μ dp dx y h top 2 k v β u b β y h top where ub is the slip velocity given by 12 u b 1 2 μ k v d p d x σ 2 2 β h top 1 β h top for parameter σ h top k v from this solution it can be shown that the general relationship between the average velocity in the free domain utop the mean filter velocity in the porous medium q and the slip velocity ub is 13 2 k v β σ 2 u top q 1 6 β h top 3 4 h top 2 σ 3 6 β h top 3 σ 2 u b q this means that using measurements solely from the bulk flow rates through and above porous medium it should be possible to predict the essential features of the flow profile such as the slip velocity and subsequently the parameter β a verification of these analytical deductions will be provided using the present experiments 3 experimental method 3 1 experimental set up a schema of the porous media test facility is shown in fig 2 major components of the test facility are the test channel into which porous media test models were inserted a 1 l acrylic reservoir a single speed centrifugal pump two piston spring loaded flow meters so as to cover the wide range of flow rates to be tested interconnecting hoses tubing and valves and a particle image velocimetry piv system the test channel was constructed from a transparent acrylic material of refractive index ri 1 47 as shown in fig 3 the internal dimensions of the channel were of length 500 mm width 109 5 mm and of variable depth h the test channel was designed so as to allow flow to be conducted through an upstream central entry of diameter 25 mm upon entry the flow was directed through a 200 mm long flow conditioning section so that it could be modulated into a reasonably uniform stream the conditioned flow was subsequently conducted through a 300 mm long downstream test section where velocity measurement could be made before exiting through another central hole of diameter 25 mm three types of model porous media were tested for clarity and convenience we will hereafter refer to these model types will hereafter be referenced as horizontal vertical and mesh models they are respectively schematized in fig 4 a b and c each of the models was constructed from acrylic circular rods of ri 1 47 as well as two side plates and one lower acrylic plate of ri 1 47 as shown in fig 4 a in the two dimensional horizontal model corresponding holes were drilled through the side plates in square array so that when installed the axes of the rods were aligned along the span of the test channel in the three dimensional vertical model holes were drilled through the lower plate of the model in square array so that the axes of the installed rods were aligned in the transverse direction as shown in fig 4 b the three dimensional mesh model is schematically shown in fig 4 c this may be seen as a hybrid of the horizontal and vertical models for such models some of the rods were held by the two side plates as in the horizontal models and some were inserted into the lower plate as in the vertical models in a regularly alternating manner but in a cubic array for all models of rod diameter d and solid volume fraction ϕ the spacing between adjacent rod centers l was obtained from 14 l d 2 π ϕ 0 5 the rods used were of diameter d 3 18 mm and 4 76 mmand inter rod spacing of l 6 mm 8 mm and 12 mm they were arrayed so as to cover solid volume fractions within the range 0 03 ϕ 0 49 the vertical models were of solid volume fraction ϕ 0 03 0 06 and 0 12 whereas each of the horizontal and mesh models were of ϕ 0 12 0 22 and 0 49 in a complete assembly each porous medium model consisted of three plates screwed together to form a box of length 300 mm and span 109 5 mm with a mean test channel depth and porous media depth of h 46 mmandh 34 mm respectively a filling fraction h h of 0 75 was achieved each of the models was tested by placing them into the section of the test channel reserved for measurement such that the center of the most upstream rods of the models were situated at 230 mm downstream of the channel entrance the coordinate system used in this work is cartesian they are identified in figs 3 and 4 the origin of the streamwise axis x 0 was located at the center of the most upstream column of rods for the transverse direction on the other hand y 0 was located at the lower wall and y 0 at the edge of the porous medium closest to the free zone flow the origin of the axis in the spanwise direction z 0 was located at the middle of the channel span a cargille immersion liquid code 5040 of kinematic viscosityν 20 10 6 m2s 1 at 25 c density ρ 848 kg m 3 and ri 1 47 was used as the working fluid the fluid was seeded with silver coated hollow glass spheres of mean diameter 10μm and specific gravity 1 4 in order to facilitate the scattering of light detectable for piv measurement the effectiveness of the particles was tested using the settling velocity v s and response time parameter τr they were respectively computed from mei et al 1991 westerweel 1996 v s ρp ρf gdp 2 18μ and τr ρpv s gdp 2 18μ the parameters ρp ρf g dp and µ are respectively the particle density fluid density the gravitational acceleration constant the particle diameter and the dynamic viscosity of the fluid based on the working fluid and seeding particles the particle settling velocity and response time were estimated to be 1 77 μm s 1 and 7 98 ps respectively these values are indeed respectively far less than the characteristic velocity and time scales used in the experiment it was therefore assumed that the seeding particles were neutrally buoyant in the fluid and faithfully following the fluid the hardware for the planar piv system used in this work are the following a nd yag laser system a dantec dynamichisense 4 m digital camera that used a charge coupled device ccd of 2048 pixel by 2048 pixel chip and pitch 7 4 μm and an intel r core tm 2 duo cpu e6750 computer system equipped with a dantec dynamicdynamicstudiocommercial software installed on its hard drive the laser system provided a nd yag 120 mj pulse laser at 532 nm wavelength of light to illuminate the flow a nikon lens with a band pass filter was fitted to the camera to capture images of the flow section the computer system was used to operate the piv system and to process data that was acquired this was done with the aid of a hub providing an interconnection and synchronization for the laser camera and the computer 3 2 velocity measurement procedure prior to the velocity measurements the piv system was calibrated to establish a scale factor between the real time displacement of the flow displacements in physical units and the pixel displacements in pixel units this was done by the use of a metallic rule fixed onto a try square at the measurement section of the channel within the still fluid careful adjustments of the camera lens were made until a fine focus of graduations of the metallic rule was reached verified through visualizations obtained using the dynamicstudio software using a field of view of 27 mm per side the dimensionless scale factor of the measurement was typically 1 8 the resultant spatial resolution was about 0 42 mm when the velocity data was processed using an interrogation window of size 32 pixels by 32 pixels by maintaining an overlap of 50 between neighbouring interrogation areas during the processing of data additional vectors were provided so that the distance between neighbouring vectors were 0 21 mm with an interrogation window of 32 pixels by 32 pixels and a sub pixel accuracy of 0 1 scarano and riethmuller 1999 the dynamic range is estimated to be 80 several precautions were taken to ensure optimum background contrast and resolution reduce peak locking and to guarantee a good signal to noise ratio these measures are similar to those detailed in arthur 2012 they are also extensively treated by raffel et al 2018 and will not be repeated here the best vector correlations of images were obtained by post processing captured images using the adaptive correlation option of the dynamicstudio software during piv measurements different test conditions were achieved by first inserting models into the test section of the test channel the channel and the metered plates were both placed on a black pvc panel and supported on a structural frame at about 1 meter high from the ground the laser and the camera were arranged so that they could be traversed along the frame mechanism in a parallel plane the camera in particular was fixed onto an x y translation stage having a least count of 0 5 mm while the test channel was also held in an x z stage also with a least count of 0 5 mm after positioning the test system the test channel was then connected to the flow circuit and the flow set at the desired speed of the test condition 3 3 statistical convergence periodicity and uncertainty assessments an extensive round of preliminary experiments were carried out to determine the minimum sample size of images sufficient for statistical convergence of velocity measurements check the entrance effects and the development of flow through models and to assess the veracity and uncertainties in measurement sample results are indicated in fig 5 for the convergence tests trials of over 200 sample images of measurements were used for each test case of flow through a plane channel on one hand and flow through and over a porous media model in those tests it was observed that for both streamwise and transverse velocities 30 images were sufficient to attain statistical convergence fig 5a furthermore preliminary tests to check entrance phenomena also showed it was only after the third row of the porous media models i e x l 3 that the flow was established to be periodic in view of these observation all velocity measurement results reported in this work are extracted with a minimum sample size of 30 images and only within the region of periodicity fig 5b c the veracity of the measurement system was established by conducting measurements in a plane channel and comparing the results of the fully developed flow with analytical results it was shown that the measurements were well within 1 5 of the analytical results fig 5d measurement uncertainties in streamwise and transverse ensemble averaged velocities were also assessed using methods outlined in adeyinka and naterer 2005 and arthur 2012 to assess the uncertainty in the streamwise and transverse velocities the bias and precision errors were identified and then quantified the bias component was first estimated considering measurement chain factors as the particle response to fluid motion light sheet positioning velocity gradient light pulse timing the size of ia the sub pixel interpolation of the displacement correlation peak and insufficient sample size the precision limit of the measured time averaged streamwise velocity was statistically evaluated using measurement data obtained from 15 rounds of experiments from this assessment the uncertainty in streamwise velocity u in the free zone is approximately 1 of the local maximum velocity umax inside the porous medium the uncertainty in u for ϕ 0 03 and 0 06 is estimated to be 1 5 of umax for porous media of ϕ 0 12 0 22 and 0 49 the uncertainties of u measured for flows through them are approximately 2 5 4 and 5 respectively of umax within the medium for the transverse velocities v total uncertainties are also estimated to be 1 of umax in the free zone and in porous medium of ϕ 0 03 and 0 06 and 2 3 and 3 5 of umax in model porous media of ϕ 0 12 0 22 and 0 49 respectively all error estimates are at 95 confidence level and are shown by error bars in pertinent plots 3 4 test conditions as illustrated in fig 6 and summarized in table 1 the piv measurements were conducted at multiple streamwise transverse x y planes within the central channel span i e 1 z l 1 this was done particularly for each vertical and mesh model test condition in order to capture the spanwise variations of velocity as the thickness of the sheet of laser light illuminating the flow section was approximately 1 5 mm channel movements along the streamwise spanwise plane were done in intervals of 2 mm covering a minimum of two unit cells of the model porous medium shown in fig 6c by so doing an array of data was obtained necessary to determine volumetric averaged velocities within a volumetric unit cell in this work all microscopic quantities are denominated by italicized lower case letters and their corresponding averaged quantities by italicized upper case letters for the cartesian frame of reference used the components of the microscopic velocity in the streamwise x and transverse y directions are designated respectively by u and v similarly averaged velocities in the x and y directions are signified respectively by u and v the volume averaged velocities respectively u v were calculated as 15 u 1 l 3 0 l 0 l 0 l u x y z d x d y d z 16 v 1 l 3 0 l 0 l 0 l v x y z d x d y d z the pertinent test conditions are summarized in table 1 in the table the rod diameter d spacing between rod centers l and solid volume fraction ϕ of the respective test models per condition are shown the solid volume fractions of porous media used are 0 03 0 06 0 12 0 22 and 0 49 the ubulk is the streamwise bulk velocity and it was calculated as follows 17 u b u l k 1 h 0 h u d y the reynolds number effect was tested for a characteristic bulk reynolds number 18 re bulk u bulk d ν the range of rebulk covered was 0 8 rebulk 10 3 4 numerical computations of equivalent permeability as the instrumentation in the current work was limited to velocity measurement the values of the mean filter dependent permeability kv eq 3 were numerically computed for each of the models within a solid volume fraction range of 0 03 to 0 60 this was done with the aid of comsol multiphysics a commercial finite element based numerical code in keeping with the experimental test model configurations the porous media were simulated first by generating an appropriate geometrical model to represent a unit cell of that porous medium as shown in fig 7 the geometric domains were meshed into unstructured triangular and quadrilateral elements in the horizontal models and additionally tetrahedral and prismatic elements in the vertical and mesh models in this way discretized forms of the steady state continuity and momentum navier stokes equations could be solved with requisite boundary conditions for the horizontal model the boundary conditions applied were that of pressure at the left and right periodic flow at the top and bottom and no slip for other wall boundaries for the vertical and mesh models the boundary conditions assigned were that of pressure at the left and right faces periodic flow conditions at the front back top and bottom faces and no slip for other wall boundaries to assure robustness in numerical computation flow domains were solved using a fully coupled parallel direct solver for the horizontal model and a fully coupled generalized minimal residual method for the vertical and mesh models from the values of the mean filter velocity and pressure gradient obtained from these computations the equivalent permeability kv for each porous medium was calculated this was done using data for which the local bulk reynolds numbers ranged from 10 7 for the darcy regime to 20 inertial laminar flow regime some preliminary measures were undertaken to ensure that the numerical solutions were independent of the mesh sizes and accurate by comparing results from mesh independence studies it was determined that the number elements were sufficient for computations if they ranged from 2000 to 2800 elements for the horizontal models 202 000 to 406 000 elements for the vertical models and 62 000 to 73 000 elements for mesh models the accuracy of the solutions was verified by comparing numerical results of specific darcy permeability with published analytical results for the case of a porous medium made of rods in square array the results shown in fig 8 indicates the accuracy of the numerical calculations as the deviations between it and the analytical solutions of kuwabara 1959 and drummond and tahir 1984 and they are within 3 for the range of fibrous porous media tested using the afore mentioned numerical procedure then the values of the equivalent permeability kv eq 3 were obtained they are shown in fig 9 and listed in table 2 5 results and discussion in this section results are presented and briefly discussed in terms of inertial effects this is done by considering changes in flow parameters resulting from changes in reynolds number the bulk flow phenomena are first assessed secondly the streamwise data are used to verify various hypotheses made in 2 elucidating the mesoscopic momentum equation applicable at the onset of inertia lastly attention is turned to the apparent viscosity and boundary layer parameters of the flow at the edge of the porous medium free flowcoupled flow to determine how these vary with inertia 5 1 general observations of bulk flow behavior sample results of flow profiles are plotted in fig 10 they show the results of volume averaged streamwise velocities u and transverse velocities v for flow at the edge of horizontal vertical and mesh models the results indicate that transverse velocities are no more than 4 of the maximum local streamwise volume averaged velocity umax when rebulk 1 on the other hand the transverse velocities increase to a maximum of about 9 of umax in high reynolds number test conditions as in mhϕ22re6 6 however in cases where the flow through the porous media is virtually a plug flow e g mmϕ49re10 3 transverse velocities are typically comparable with the streamwise velocities these descriptions are common with each type of porous medium model tested these observations suggest that the increase in flow rate in the regime of inertia leads to the increment of multi dimensional effects within the porous medium flow while the consequences of these effects are not totally clear an inference is that as reynolds number increases the complexity of the flow may not be sufficiently described by simple one dimensional equations other parameters useful in showing discernible effects of inertia on the bulk flow were studied these parameters include the wall normal position of the maximum velocity ymax the percentage flow rates per unit width of test section channelled through the free zone and the ratio of the maximum and average velocities conducted through the whole test channel umax ubulk results presented in table 2 for all the types of model porous media show that the increase in rebulk from 1 to 7 is usually attended with up to a 115 shift in the position of umax towards the top wall furthermore as shown in table 2 and fig 11 increasing rebulk within the range of reynolds number for the model types tested leads to as much as 20 more of the fractional flow being diverted into the porous medium as long as ϕ 0 22 it is only at ϕ 0 22 that the effective drag due to the walls of the porous medium is high enough to resist significant surges in relative bulk flow through them as a further study of the inertial effects in the bulk flow the umax ubulk ratios are plotted in fig 11 c f i the plots show that the bulk distribution of flow and the umax ubulk ratios decreases by about 22 as rebulk rises from 1 to 7 this reduction however tends to become less significant as ϕ 0 22 and insignificant at ϕ 0 49 the results also indicate that for all the models tested as rebulk grows the rate of increase in umax is relatively lower than ubulk and this remains the case even at ϕ 0 49 5 2 verification of momentum equation a close observation of streamwise data in fig 10 shows that the shape of the streamwise profiles are sigmoidal with asymptotes in the free zone and in the porous medium as expected then after applying curve fitting techniques to the averaged unnormalized experimental data the interfacial flow was found to be well described by sigmoidal curves such as the dose response curve eq 4 and the normal cumulative distribution curve to maintain brevity and simplicity however only the dose response sample curve fits are demonstrated in this work for each model porous medium type this is shown using sample results in fig 12 table 3 indicates that these fits are excellent since they yield adjusted coefficient of determinations r2 of 0 98 and above the values of a b p and d are listed in table 3 as further shown in fig 13 the constants a and b in eq 2 are respectively equivalent to the average velocity in the porous medium q and the maximum velocity in the free zone umax from the data it is not clear how unknown constants p and d may be predicted separately it remains a matter of resolution in a future study whether these values are unique to the porous medium and or the reynolds number regardless the curve fitted plots conclusively prove as hypothesized in 2 that the form of brinkman equation defined in eqs 2 and 3 is the approximate momentum equation at the edge of the porous medium at the onset of inertia furthermore it is pointed out that the application of this equation ranges from low solid volume fractions as pertaining to fibrous porous media of solid volume fraction ϕ 0 12 to relatively high solid volume fraction for more compact porous media giving that the vertical models of ϕ 0 03 were constructed with free zone depths less than the porous medium inter rod distance l the curve fits show that eq 2 may be used not only in a porous medium free flowcoupled flow but generally for flows bounded by varying porous media in 2 it was pointed out that a more practical utility of eq 2 is the derivation of a boundary condition eq 9 applicable in the analyses of the flow at a two domain macroscopic level in fig 14 plots of ub q against utop q in a general plot fig 14a are provided for each porous medium fig 14b c d they are linear as suggested in eq 13 and give credence to the fact that by merely measuring global parameters such as the pressure gradient the average velocity through and above the porous medium ub β and the macroscopic profile may be obtained it is to be noted however from eq 6 fig 15 and summaries in table 4 that the parameter β is a complex function that is dependent on the reynolds number of the flow at the onset of inertia it appears that inertial effects at the interface are more dominant at lower solid volume fraction thus for vertical models the change in β as reynolds number increases from 0 8 to 8 increases by margins up to 180 when ϕ 0 03 but is only 8 when ϕ 0 12 and the reynolds number increases from 1 to 7 it is also important to note that inertia changes are also a factor of the porous medium type a comparison of the porous media indicates that inertia changes are least 8 for vertical models and most substantial 42 in horizontal models these observations suggest then that the greater surface resistance offered by the porous medium at the projected interfacial plane the greater the inertial effects 5 3 apparent viscosity in line with expectations from a mesoscopic level of description the apparent viscosity μ for each test model was found to vary at the transitional interfacial zone to a constant value within the porous medium values of this viscosity at the interface μ o and within the porous medium μ are reported in fig 16 and table 4 there are four noteworthy observations that can be made from the results in the first place the apparent viscosity increases with reynolds number indeed at the interface where high flow persists along with the dominating effects of inertia increment in reynolds number results in up to 100 changes in the apparent viscosities even within the porous medium where inertial effects are relatively subdued the increase in reynolds number still leads to up to 45 changes in apparent viscosity values a second observation that cannot be missed is that the apparent viscosity values reduce by decades with changes in location from the porous free zone interface to depths within the same porous medium this is a significant but not a surprising phenomenon giving that the prominence of location effects is predicted in the variable apparent viscosity model shown in eq 5 the third point that may be made is that the apparent viscosity tends to decrease with decreasing solid volume fraction or increasing equivalent permeability this is also consistent with the variable apparent permeability model given in eq 5 consequently it may be noted fourthly that the apparent viscosities vary significantly with model porous media type compared to the other models the mesh models which are the most permeable of all the three models record the least values of apparent viscosity the foregoing observations thus reinforce the idea that the apparent viscosity is indeed a complex parameter that is a function of both porous media and flow parameters in a porous medium free flow coupled flow this parameter is responsible for diffusing the macroscopic heterogeneities in the velocity scales of the flow as the flow transitions from the free zone to the porous medium for this reason its value is highest at the interface and inertial zones where it is required for viscous diffusion and its value is least at zones where inertia is relatively low in porous medium free flow coupled flow arrangements where the porous medium is of high permeability and there is a low heterogeneity between the free zone flow and the porous medium flow the apparent viscosity is expectedly relatively low on the other hand in arrangements where the porous medium is of low permeability and therefore the disparity between free zone and porous medium flow is larger the apparent viscosity is higher as sahraoui and kaviany 1992 also used a variable model for flow through and over horizontal model porous media a note of comparison of that result with the current data is necessary in contrast to the present observations the numerical simulations of sahraoui and kaviany 1992 showed local apparent viscosity distributions that increased with depth into the medium they also noted that the apparent viscosity decreased with increasing solid volume fraction the reason for this marked difference in their result from the present data lies in the distinctively different apparent viscosity models applied in either work 5 4 boundary layer parameters in 2 it was asserted that the streamwise flow at the edge of the porous medium may be seen as a boundary layer the study of the boundary layer beneath the interface is of particular importance noting that it provides an important value of flow penetrating into the porous medium as well as the deficits in mass and momentum due to the presence of a porous medium in a plain flow in this regard then it is important to study the behavior of the boundary layer thickness δ the displacement thickness δ and the momentum thickness θ these are defined in eqs 6 to 8 and experimentally measured and presented in table 4 and fig 17 it is difficult to clearly decipher the nature of δ from eq 6 given the unpredictable nature of p and d however it is clearly a factor of q and therefore the reynolds number of the local flow using the experimental values of δ obtained by assuming a linear interpolation between the spatially averaged piv data values it was found that δ which is also a measure of the depth of penetration is at least twice that of kv for the test models the horizontal models recorded the highest values of δ furthermore δ tended to reduce with increasing solid volume fraction thus it may be inferred that the presence solid surfaces due to the increasing complexity or the compactness of the porous medium essentially helps in the decay of the free zone velocity as it penetrates through the porous medium while δ appears to be affected by inertia its trend is not clear it is expected that mass and momentum deficits indicated respectively by δ and θ of the free zone flow will increase due flow retardation caused by the presence of the porous medium eqs 7 and 8 however indicate that an increase in the mean filter velocity in the porous medium q leads to a decrease in both mass and momentum deficits thus as confirmed in the test data the increase in the local reynolds number in the porous medium from 1 to 7 results in as much as 108 reduction in mass flow deficit and reduction momentum deficits the highest cuts in deficits are observed in the mesh model an examination of the shape parameter h δ θ as summarized in table 4 indicates that the momentum flux of the flow increases at the expense of mass flux as the local reynolds number increases from 1 to 10 6 conclusion the focus of this work has been to characterize the flow through and over porous media at the onset of inertia this has been done using analytical deductions volume averaged piv measurements and numerical simulations of flow through and over complex porous media models the following conclusions may be drawn from this study the momentum equation for the inertial flow at bulk reynolds number between 1 and 10 has been confirmed to be essentially brinkman in form however that equation is associated with a variable model of the apparent viscosity and an equivalent permeability that prevails in the forchheimer regime the apparent viscosity is a complex parameter that is a function of both porous media and flow parameters in aporous medium free flow coupled flow this parameter appears to be responsible for diffusing the macroscopic heterogeneities in the velocity scales of the flow as the flow transitions from the free zone to the porous medium for this reason its value is highest at the interface and inertial zones and its value is least at zones where inertia is relatively low additionally the apparent viscosity tends to decrease with increasing equivalent permeability and least in the most permeable porous media using the sigmoidal velocity profile at the edge of the medium a boundary condition equivalent to that of beavers and joseph 1967 may be obtained a constant associated with this condition β and other factors that can be obtained from bulk measurements and other relations and these may be used to solve the macroscopic two domain porous medium free zone flow an examination of the bulk flow apparent viscosity boundary condition empirical constant and relevant boundary layer parameters indicates that for porous medium free flow coupled flows the interface is the porous media zone that is affected most by reynolds number changes as inertia sets in given the range of complexity of porous media tested it is expected that these conclusions will also apply to real isotropic porous media these results are expected to provide tools for analytical and numerical validations and prediction of interfacial flow pertaining to isotropic porous media 7 author statement this author james kofi arthur is solely responsible for the conceptualization

391,in this paper laminar flow through and over models of porous media is studied to characterize the flow at the onset of inertia horizontal vertical or mesh arrays of circular rods are used to model the porous medium the rods are arranged to cover solid volume fraction ranging from 0 03 to 0 49 and to fill approximately three quarters of the depth of the test section each of the porous media models is tested in a refractive index matched viscous fluid flow driven by pressure the reynolds number is also varied over an order of magnitude to cover the regime at which the porous medium flow just transitions from a darcy to an inertia laminar flow regime velocity measurements are then obtained by a planar particle image velocimetry technique the experimental data confirms that the averaged transition flow is indeed governed by the brinkman equation if modeled with a new parametrization of the apparent viscosity and modified with an equivalent permeability that accounts for the effects of inertia additionally the results show that at such inertial flows the interfacial region is the porous medium zone affected most by changes in reynolds numbers the data presented in this work provide tools for analytical and numerical validations and the prediction of interfacial flow pertaining to isotropic porous media 1 introduction flow through and over porous media occurs in a variety of natural and industrial applications it is specifically relevant in the consideration of surface or subsurface water resources it is therefore no surprise that the study of this flow has been the subject of several works over several decades despite the progress that has been made in the study of this coupled porous medium free flow problem some fundamental questions about the flow remain foremostly the formulation of transport equations that adequately characterizes the averaged flow behavior in the laminar regime is still an open problem shavit 2009 in one of the first attempts at resolving the problem brinkman 1949 considered the flow as a single volume averaged domain for a unidirectional fluid flow of dynamic viscosity µ averaged streamwise velocity u varying in the transverse direction y an averaged streamwise pressure gradient dp dx across an isotropic porous medium of specific permeability k brinkman 1949 postulated that the flow is governed by an equation that may be expressed as 1 dp dx μ d 2 u d y 2 μ u k an important attribute of this equation is that it was formulated for a non inertial laminar flow regime furthermore it employs an empirically determined apparent or effective viscosity µ to account for the viscous diffusion within the complicated free zone porous medium flow domain while the brinkman equation was initially proposed to study the viscous flow past a dense swarm of spherical particles in a porous mass its application has been extended for a wide range of free zone porous media arrangements additionally it has been verified by several works e g tam 1969 freed and muthukumar 1978 givler and altobelli 1994 other researchers led by beavers and joseph 1967 also considered the problem from quite another perspective they focussed on defining hydrodynamic interfacial boundary conditions between the microscopic free flow governed by the navier stokes equation and the averaged porous medium flow governed by the darcy law or the forchheimer equation the results of that approach have been corroborated in a wide range of theoretical and experimental studies saffman 1971 beavers et al 1974 gupte and advani 1997 chandesris and jamet 2009 however the treatment of the coupled porous medium free flow problem at the onset of inertia using the approach of beaver and joseph 1967 or even that of brinkman 1949 have been relatively few sahraoui and kaviany 1992 ochoa tapia and whitaker 1998 hsu and chang 1990 the brinkman approach in particular has some notable advantages those advantages include the potential to provide accurate predictions of the porous media free zone interfacial boundary layers an adaptability for application for the entire coupled porous medium free flow domain and more importantly the capability to be extended for a wider range of laminar flow conditions those unique utilities of the brinkman approach are the kind required for an accurate assessment of mass and momentum transfer through the flow domain and for other flow assessments at the onset of inertia they have however not been sufficiently explored it is therefore a primary aim of this research study to investigate some of these prospects of the brinkman equation and to employ them in the characterization of the coupled porous medium free flow problem in employing the brinkman approach in this work the modeling of the apparent viscosity is considered as a key requirement to an adequate description of the interfacial flow with or without inertia the modeling of the apparent viscosity has been examined in previous research studies however those studies have resulted in mixed outcomes for instance while some researchers e g koplik et al 1983 have proposed a model of the apparent viscosity to be less than the fluid viscosity others e g kim and russell 1985 have showed that the apparent viscosity is greater than the viscosity of the fluid in this work a rarely used variable apparent viscosity model is presented as a valid and versatile option to the best of this author s knowledge the numerical work of sahraoui and kaviany 1992 is the only work reported in the literature that employs a variable model of the apparent viscosity it appears no other study has pursued any other kind nor verified any with experimental test data an important product of this work then is to present a new variable model of the apparent viscosity of the brinkman equation and to use experimental data to demonstrate its effectiveness in describing the interfacial flow another distinctive feature of this work is that special attention is focussed on the flow phenomena at the onset of inertia this is an important practical consideration giving that several flow applications ranging from flows near well bores or flows through fractures or steady currents running over riverbeds involve flow regimes transitioning to the inertial range as noted the preponderance of related studies appear to be limited to non inertial laminar flows even when some have considered modifications of the brinkman equation for inertial flows e g vafai and tien 1981 hsu and chang 1990 abbasbandy et al 2017 detailed experimental verifications appear to be non existent this work seeks to fill that current gap in the literature by using detail measurement data to characterize the flow at the onset of inertia in undertaking this task of flow characterization periodic arrays of rods are used to model porous media this is a classic model employed in the past by various researchers sahraoui and kaviany 1992 james and davis 2001 arthur et al 2009 this arrangement lends suitability to fundamental flow studies such that the rods may be arranged in the same direction to simulate a two or three dimensional porous media configuration sahraoui and kaviany 1992 james and davis 2001 tachie et al 2004 or two orthogonal directions to simulate a three dimensional brush flow configuration arthur 2012 the relative ease in the use of such models is of immense value in the application of fundamental analyses as well as non intrusive flow measurement techniques at the same time they are useful in simulating real cases such as flows through and over banks of heat exchangers rigid vegetation subject to the fluid flow or an overlying flow associated with woven structures in this work models are achieved using a two dimensional porous medium arrangement and two kinds of three dimensional porous medium arrangement the rods of the models are arrayed to cover a wide range of solid volume fraction ϕ from 0 03 to 0 49 this range covers both loosely packed and compact porous media these models were used in the generation of an extensive data applicable to a wide range of complexity of porous media structures in order to provide substantial support for the analytical model proposed in this work in order to account for the onset of inertial effects the range of bulk reynolds number is also varied from 1 to 10 this reynolds number range is within the scope of laminar flow regime where inertia is expected to be just apparent within the porous medium arthur 2018 in summary then the goal of this work is to characterize the flow through and over porous media problem at the onset of inertia as an integral aspect of the study a brinkman equation of the flow domain is verified this equation is initially based on a hypothesis that at the onset of inertia the momentum equation is a form of an equation by brinkman 1949 with a novel parameterization of the apparent viscosity and the equivalent permeability the hypothesis is tested using detailed velocity measurements obtained from a high resolution planar particle image velocimetry piv technique in a refractive index matched fluid flow section to capture the variations of velocities in the two and three dimensional porous media array multiple streamwise transverse planes are measured at various spanwise locations of the test section these measurements are then averaged over a representative elementary volume to provide volume averages the averaged quantities are subsequently used to characterize the flow through and over the model porous media and to suggest how the flow profile and its parameters may be predicted the analyses are done using equivalent permeability values obtained from finite element comsol multiphysics simulations after verifying the brinkman equation with the test data the parametric values of the associated new apparent viscosity model are obtained and studied further the paper is organized as follows an analysis of the flow problem is first presented in 2 the experimental and numerical approaches are then described in 3 and 4 respectively the research results are subsequently presented and discussed in 5 finally the major conclusions of the work are summarized in 6 2 analysis of the flow problem a schematic diagram of the flow domain is shown in fig 1 in this analysis a steady incompressible laminar flow through and over a homogenous rigid porous medium is considered in this case body forces are neglected at the microscopic level of description microscopic mass and momentum conservation equations may be used to describe the flow in the entire flow section however by applying the same volume averaging over a representative elementary volume throughout the flow domain the scale of description is transformed into a mesoscopic type where a single equivalent medium replaces the fluid and solid phases at such an up scaled description the interfacial zone between the flow domain may be more practically resolved through numerical computations considering the porous medium and the open free zone that description as a continuous heterogenous transition zone with varying flow domain properties jamet et al 2009 furthermore the same volume averaged transport equation is validly applied everywhere as noted in 1 the brinkman equation is a volume averaged momentum equation applicable at a mesoscopic scale in a flow regime where inertia is not a factor in other works e g abbasbandy et al 2017 modifications to the brinkman equation for inertial laminar flows have been suggested notably including an inertial coefficient and the darcy coefficient however in this study it is hypothesized that for a steady state one dimensional flow case directed only in the streamwise x direction by a uniform averaged pressure gradient dp dx an equation similar to the brinkman equation is applicable even at the onset of inertia within the porous medium the equation being a balance of the pressure gradient the divergence of the stress tensor and damping force due to the porous medium is of the form 2 dp dx μ d 2 u d y 2 μ u k v as for eq 1 u is the volume averaged mean filter velocity in the direction of the flow in the porous medium this is specifically a constant mean filter velocity q as the regime of flow in the porous medium of the current analysis is one in which inertia is to be factored an inertial form of the permeability is used instead of the specific permeability in eq 1 this new permeability kv represents the equivalent permeability of the porous medium obtained from the forchheimer 1901 equation expressed by 3 dp dx μ k q κ ρ q 2 1 k 1 κ k ρ q μ μ q μ k v q where κ k ρ are respectively the inertial coefficient darcy specific permeability and fluid density again it is further hypothesized that the flow profile at the edge of the interface being a double sided boundary layer would not significantly deviate from a sigmoidal function with asymptotic values in the porous medium and the free zone arthur 2012 arthur 2019 with that in mind then the sigmoidal solution of 2 for which u a q as y and u b equivalent to the maximum velocity in the free zone as y is of the form 4 u y a b a 1 10 d y p where p and d are unknown factors respectively characterizing the hill slope and the transverse component of the center of the velocity profile this solution is true if 5 μ 10 p d y 1 3 ln 2 10 p 2 10 p d y 1 2 10 p d y k v μ the foregoing hypotheses will be tested experimentally for a wide range of coupled porous medium free flow cases furthermore the nature of empirical factors such as μ and the effects by inertia on the boundary layer parameters will also be probed further as the velocity profile around the interfacial zone is that of a boundary layer some boundary layer parameters can be defined and used to study the flow as affected by inertia following neale and nader 1974 the boundary layer thickness δ may be defined as the transverse distance measured from the interface into the porous medium at which the velocity first decays to within 1 of q i e 1 01q thus at y δ using this definition in eq 4 6 δ 1 p log 10 b q 0 01 q d this boundary layer thickness δ is a measure of the depth of penetration of flow from the free zone into the porous medium the displacement thickness δ and the momentum thickness θ of the boundary layer within the edge of the porous medium may also be respectively expressed by 7 δ 0 u q 1 dy ln 10 dp 1 ln 10 dp b q ln 10 pq 0 δ u q 1 dy and 8 θ 0 u q u q 1 dy b q q b 10 dp 1 ln 10 dp 1 ln 10 dp 1 ln 10 p q 2 10 dp 1 0 δ u q u q 1 dy while eqs 4 to 8 would serve immense benefits in an analytical study their practical utility may be limited by the seemingly unpredictable nature of empirical constants such as p and d however for a macroscopic two domain study made up of a forchheimer porous medium flow and a parallel laminar flow in the free zone it is quite clear from eq 4 that at the interface y 0 the boundary condition at the interface is given by 9 du dy y 0 u b q ln 10 p 10 pd 10 pd 1 u b q β where ub is the slip velocity i e u at y 0 and β is an empirical constant this is similar to the boundary condition suggested by beavers and joseph 1967 if eq 4 holds true then it will confirm the applicability of the beavers and joseph 1967 boundary condition at the onset of inertia more importantly the question of the practical determination of β from global bulk flow measurements can be resolved as follows for a fully developed poiseuille flow in the free zone given by 10 d p d x μ 2 u y 2 and the porous medium flow governed by the forchheimer equation expressed in eq 3 if continuity in velocity and stress is allowed at the interface then by considering the no slip upper wall boundary condition u 0 at y h top and the interfacial boundary condition in eq 9 the flow in the free zone y 0 may be expressed as 11 u y 1 2 μ dp dx y h top 2 k v β u b β y h top where ub is the slip velocity given by 12 u b 1 2 μ k v d p d x σ 2 2 β h top 1 β h top for parameter σ h top k v from this solution it can be shown that the general relationship between the average velocity in the free domain utop the mean filter velocity in the porous medium q and the slip velocity ub is 13 2 k v β σ 2 u top q 1 6 β h top 3 4 h top 2 σ 3 6 β h top 3 σ 2 u b q this means that using measurements solely from the bulk flow rates through and above porous medium it should be possible to predict the essential features of the flow profile such as the slip velocity and subsequently the parameter β a verification of these analytical deductions will be provided using the present experiments 3 experimental method 3 1 experimental set up a schema of the porous media test facility is shown in fig 2 major components of the test facility are the test channel into which porous media test models were inserted a 1 l acrylic reservoir a single speed centrifugal pump two piston spring loaded flow meters so as to cover the wide range of flow rates to be tested interconnecting hoses tubing and valves and a particle image velocimetry piv system the test channel was constructed from a transparent acrylic material of refractive index ri 1 47 as shown in fig 3 the internal dimensions of the channel were of length 500 mm width 109 5 mm and of variable depth h the test channel was designed so as to allow flow to be conducted through an upstream central entry of diameter 25 mm upon entry the flow was directed through a 200 mm long flow conditioning section so that it could be modulated into a reasonably uniform stream the conditioned flow was subsequently conducted through a 300 mm long downstream test section where velocity measurement could be made before exiting through another central hole of diameter 25 mm three types of model porous media were tested for clarity and convenience we will hereafter refer to these model types will hereafter be referenced as horizontal vertical and mesh models they are respectively schematized in fig 4 a b and c each of the models was constructed from acrylic circular rods of ri 1 47 as well as two side plates and one lower acrylic plate of ri 1 47 as shown in fig 4 a in the two dimensional horizontal model corresponding holes were drilled through the side plates in square array so that when installed the axes of the rods were aligned along the span of the test channel in the three dimensional vertical model holes were drilled through the lower plate of the model in square array so that the axes of the installed rods were aligned in the transverse direction as shown in fig 4 b the three dimensional mesh model is schematically shown in fig 4 c this may be seen as a hybrid of the horizontal and vertical models for such models some of the rods were held by the two side plates as in the horizontal models and some were inserted into the lower plate as in the vertical models in a regularly alternating manner but in a cubic array for all models of rod diameter d and solid volume fraction ϕ the spacing between adjacent rod centers l was obtained from 14 l d 2 π ϕ 0 5 the rods used were of diameter d 3 18 mm and 4 76 mmand inter rod spacing of l 6 mm 8 mm and 12 mm they were arrayed so as to cover solid volume fractions within the range 0 03 ϕ 0 49 the vertical models were of solid volume fraction ϕ 0 03 0 06 and 0 12 whereas each of the horizontal and mesh models were of ϕ 0 12 0 22 and 0 49 in a complete assembly each porous medium model consisted of three plates screwed together to form a box of length 300 mm and span 109 5 mm with a mean test channel depth and porous media depth of h 46 mmandh 34 mm respectively a filling fraction h h of 0 75 was achieved each of the models was tested by placing them into the section of the test channel reserved for measurement such that the center of the most upstream rods of the models were situated at 230 mm downstream of the channel entrance the coordinate system used in this work is cartesian they are identified in figs 3 and 4 the origin of the streamwise axis x 0 was located at the center of the most upstream column of rods for the transverse direction on the other hand y 0 was located at the lower wall and y 0 at the edge of the porous medium closest to the free zone flow the origin of the axis in the spanwise direction z 0 was located at the middle of the channel span a cargille immersion liquid code 5040 of kinematic viscosityν 20 10 6 m2s 1 at 25 c density ρ 848 kg m 3 and ri 1 47 was used as the working fluid the fluid was seeded with silver coated hollow glass spheres of mean diameter 10μm and specific gravity 1 4 in order to facilitate the scattering of light detectable for piv measurement the effectiveness of the particles was tested using the settling velocity v s and response time parameter τr they were respectively computed from mei et al 1991 westerweel 1996 v s ρp ρf gdp 2 18μ and τr ρpv s gdp 2 18μ the parameters ρp ρf g dp and µ are respectively the particle density fluid density the gravitational acceleration constant the particle diameter and the dynamic viscosity of the fluid based on the working fluid and seeding particles the particle settling velocity and response time were estimated to be 1 77 μm s 1 and 7 98 ps respectively these values are indeed respectively far less than the characteristic velocity and time scales used in the experiment it was therefore assumed that the seeding particles were neutrally buoyant in the fluid and faithfully following the fluid the hardware for the planar piv system used in this work are the following a nd yag laser system a dantec dynamichisense 4 m digital camera that used a charge coupled device ccd of 2048 pixel by 2048 pixel chip and pitch 7 4 μm and an intel r core tm 2 duo cpu e6750 computer system equipped with a dantec dynamicdynamicstudiocommercial software installed on its hard drive the laser system provided a nd yag 120 mj pulse laser at 532 nm wavelength of light to illuminate the flow a nikon lens with a band pass filter was fitted to the camera to capture images of the flow section the computer system was used to operate the piv system and to process data that was acquired this was done with the aid of a hub providing an interconnection and synchronization for the laser camera and the computer 3 2 velocity measurement procedure prior to the velocity measurements the piv system was calibrated to establish a scale factor between the real time displacement of the flow displacements in physical units and the pixel displacements in pixel units this was done by the use of a metallic rule fixed onto a try square at the measurement section of the channel within the still fluid careful adjustments of the camera lens were made until a fine focus of graduations of the metallic rule was reached verified through visualizations obtained using the dynamicstudio software using a field of view of 27 mm per side the dimensionless scale factor of the measurement was typically 1 8 the resultant spatial resolution was about 0 42 mm when the velocity data was processed using an interrogation window of size 32 pixels by 32 pixels by maintaining an overlap of 50 between neighbouring interrogation areas during the processing of data additional vectors were provided so that the distance between neighbouring vectors were 0 21 mm with an interrogation window of 32 pixels by 32 pixels and a sub pixel accuracy of 0 1 scarano and riethmuller 1999 the dynamic range is estimated to be 80 several precautions were taken to ensure optimum background contrast and resolution reduce peak locking and to guarantee a good signal to noise ratio these measures are similar to those detailed in arthur 2012 they are also extensively treated by raffel et al 2018 and will not be repeated here the best vector correlations of images were obtained by post processing captured images using the adaptive correlation option of the dynamicstudio software during piv measurements different test conditions were achieved by first inserting models into the test section of the test channel the channel and the metered plates were both placed on a black pvc panel and supported on a structural frame at about 1 meter high from the ground the laser and the camera were arranged so that they could be traversed along the frame mechanism in a parallel plane the camera in particular was fixed onto an x y translation stage having a least count of 0 5 mm while the test channel was also held in an x z stage also with a least count of 0 5 mm after positioning the test system the test channel was then connected to the flow circuit and the flow set at the desired speed of the test condition 3 3 statistical convergence periodicity and uncertainty assessments an extensive round of preliminary experiments were carried out to determine the minimum sample size of images sufficient for statistical convergence of velocity measurements check the entrance effects and the development of flow through models and to assess the veracity and uncertainties in measurement sample results are indicated in fig 5 for the convergence tests trials of over 200 sample images of measurements were used for each test case of flow through a plane channel on one hand and flow through and over a porous media model in those tests it was observed that for both streamwise and transverse velocities 30 images were sufficient to attain statistical convergence fig 5a furthermore preliminary tests to check entrance phenomena also showed it was only after the third row of the porous media models i e x l 3 that the flow was established to be periodic in view of these observation all velocity measurement results reported in this work are extracted with a minimum sample size of 30 images and only within the region of periodicity fig 5b c the veracity of the measurement system was established by conducting measurements in a plane channel and comparing the results of the fully developed flow with analytical results it was shown that the measurements were well within 1 5 of the analytical results fig 5d measurement uncertainties in streamwise and transverse ensemble averaged velocities were also assessed using methods outlined in adeyinka and naterer 2005 and arthur 2012 to assess the uncertainty in the streamwise and transverse velocities the bias and precision errors were identified and then quantified the bias component was first estimated considering measurement chain factors as the particle response to fluid motion light sheet positioning velocity gradient light pulse timing the size of ia the sub pixel interpolation of the displacement correlation peak and insufficient sample size the precision limit of the measured time averaged streamwise velocity was statistically evaluated using measurement data obtained from 15 rounds of experiments from this assessment the uncertainty in streamwise velocity u in the free zone is approximately 1 of the local maximum velocity umax inside the porous medium the uncertainty in u for ϕ 0 03 and 0 06 is estimated to be 1 5 of umax for porous media of ϕ 0 12 0 22 and 0 49 the uncertainties of u measured for flows through them are approximately 2 5 4 and 5 respectively of umax within the medium for the transverse velocities v total uncertainties are also estimated to be 1 of umax in the free zone and in porous medium of ϕ 0 03 and 0 06 and 2 3 and 3 5 of umax in model porous media of ϕ 0 12 0 22 and 0 49 respectively all error estimates are at 95 confidence level and are shown by error bars in pertinent plots 3 4 test conditions as illustrated in fig 6 and summarized in table 1 the piv measurements were conducted at multiple streamwise transverse x y planes within the central channel span i e 1 z l 1 this was done particularly for each vertical and mesh model test condition in order to capture the spanwise variations of velocity as the thickness of the sheet of laser light illuminating the flow section was approximately 1 5 mm channel movements along the streamwise spanwise plane were done in intervals of 2 mm covering a minimum of two unit cells of the model porous medium shown in fig 6c by so doing an array of data was obtained necessary to determine volumetric averaged velocities within a volumetric unit cell in this work all microscopic quantities are denominated by italicized lower case letters and their corresponding averaged quantities by italicized upper case letters for the cartesian frame of reference used the components of the microscopic velocity in the streamwise x and transverse y directions are designated respectively by u and v similarly averaged velocities in the x and y directions are signified respectively by u and v the volume averaged velocities respectively u v were calculated as 15 u 1 l 3 0 l 0 l 0 l u x y z d x d y d z 16 v 1 l 3 0 l 0 l 0 l v x y z d x d y d z the pertinent test conditions are summarized in table 1 in the table the rod diameter d spacing between rod centers l and solid volume fraction ϕ of the respective test models per condition are shown the solid volume fractions of porous media used are 0 03 0 06 0 12 0 22 and 0 49 the ubulk is the streamwise bulk velocity and it was calculated as follows 17 u b u l k 1 h 0 h u d y the reynolds number effect was tested for a characteristic bulk reynolds number 18 re bulk u bulk d ν the range of rebulk covered was 0 8 rebulk 10 3 4 numerical computations of equivalent permeability as the instrumentation in the current work was limited to velocity measurement the values of the mean filter dependent permeability kv eq 3 were numerically computed for each of the models within a solid volume fraction range of 0 03 to 0 60 this was done with the aid of comsol multiphysics a commercial finite element based numerical code in keeping with the experimental test model configurations the porous media were simulated first by generating an appropriate geometrical model to represent a unit cell of that porous medium as shown in fig 7 the geometric domains were meshed into unstructured triangular and quadrilateral elements in the horizontal models and additionally tetrahedral and prismatic elements in the vertical and mesh models in this way discretized forms of the steady state continuity and momentum navier stokes equations could be solved with requisite boundary conditions for the horizontal model the boundary conditions applied were that of pressure at the left and right periodic flow at the top and bottom and no slip for other wall boundaries for the vertical and mesh models the boundary conditions assigned were that of pressure at the left and right faces periodic flow conditions at the front back top and bottom faces and no slip for other wall boundaries to assure robustness in numerical computation flow domains were solved using a fully coupled parallel direct solver for the horizontal model and a fully coupled generalized minimal residual method for the vertical and mesh models from the values of the mean filter velocity and pressure gradient obtained from these computations the equivalent permeability kv for each porous medium was calculated this was done using data for which the local bulk reynolds numbers ranged from 10 7 for the darcy regime to 20 inertial laminar flow regime some preliminary measures were undertaken to ensure that the numerical solutions were independent of the mesh sizes and accurate by comparing results from mesh independence studies it was determined that the number elements were sufficient for computations if they ranged from 2000 to 2800 elements for the horizontal models 202 000 to 406 000 elements for the vertical models and 62 000 to 73 000 elements for mesh models the accuracy of the solutions was verified by comparing numerical results of specific darcy permeability with published analytical results for the case of a porous medium made of rods in square array the results shown in fig 8 indicates the accuracy of the numerical calculations as the deviations between it and the analytical solutions of kuwabara 1959 and drummond and tahir 1984 and they are within 3 for the range of fibrous porous media tested using the afore mentioned numerical procedure then the values of the equivalent permeability kv eq 3 were obtained they are shown in fig 9 and listed in table 2 5 results and discussion in this section results are presented and briefly discussed in terms of inertial effects this is done by considering changes in flow parameters resulting from changes in reynolds number the bulk flow phenomena are first assessed secondly the streamwise data are used to verify various hypotheses made in 2 elucidating the mesoscopic momentum equation applicable at the onset of inertia lastly attention is turned to the apparent viscosity and boundary layer parameters of the flow at the edge of the porous medium free flowcoupled flow to determine how these vary with inertia 5 1 general observations of bulk flow behavior sample results of flow profiles are plotted in fig 10 they show the results of volume averaged streamwise velocities u and transverse velocities v for flow at the edge of horizontal vertical and mesh models the results indicate that transverse velocities are no more than 4 of the maximum local streamwise volume averaged velocity umax when rebulk 1 on the other hand the transverse velocities increase to a maximum of about 9 of umax in high reynolds number test conditions as in mhϕ22re6 6 however in cases where the flow through the porous media is virtually a plug flow e g mmϕ49re10 3 transverse velocities are typically comparable with the streamwise velocities these descriptions are common with each type of porous medium model tested these observations suggest that the increase in flow rate in the regime of inertia leads to the increment of multi dimensional effects within the porous medium flow while the consequences of these effects are not totally clear an inference is that as reynolds number increases the complexity of the flow may not be sufficiently described by simple one dimensional equations other parameters useful in showing discernible effects of inertia on the bulk flow were studied these parameters include the wall normal position of the maximum velocity ymax the percentage flow rates per unit width of test section channelled through the free zone and the ratio of the maximum and average velocities conducted through the whole test channel umax ubulk results presented in table 2 for all the types of model porous media show that the increase in rebulk from 1 to 7 is usually attended with up to a 115 shift in the position of umax towards the top wall furthermore as shown in table 2 and fig 11 increasing rebulk within the range of reynolds number for the model types tested leads to as much as 20 more of the fractional flow being diverted into the porous medium as long as ϕ 0 22 it is only at ϕ 0 22 that the effective drag due to the walls of the porous medium is high enough to resist significant surges in relative bulk flow through them as a further study of the inertial effects in the bulk flow the umax ubulk ratios are plotted in fig 11 c f i the plots show that the bulk distribution of flow and the umax ubulk ratios decreases by about 22 as rebulk rises from 1 to 7 this reduction however tends to become less significant as ϕ 0 22 and insignificant at ϕ 0 49 the results also indicate that for all the models tested as rebulk grows the rate of increase in umax is relatively lower than ubulk and this remains the case even at ϕ 0 49 5 2 verification of momentum equation a close observation of streamwise data in fig 10 shows that the shape of the streamwise profiles are sigmoidal with asymptotes in the free zone and in the porous medium as expected then after applying curve fitting techniques to the averaged unnormalized experimental data the interfacial flow was found to be well described by sigmoidal curves such as the dose response curve eq 4 and the normal cumulative distribution curve to maintain brevity and simplicity however only the dose response sample curve fits are demonstrated in this work for each model porous medium type this is shown using sample results in fig 12 table 3 indicates that these fits are excellent since they yield adjusted coefficient of determinations r2 of 0 98 and above the values of a b p and d are listed in table 3 as further shown in fig 13 the constants a and b in eq 2 are respectively equivalent to the average velocity in the porous medium q and the maximum velocity in the free zone umax from the data it is not clear how unknown constants p and d may be predicted separately it remains a matter of resolution in a future study whether these values are unique to the porous medium and or the reynolds number regardless the curve fitted plots conclusively prove as hypothesized in 2 that the form of brinkman equation defined in eqs 2 and 3 is the approximate momentum equation at the edge of the porous medium at the onset of inertia furthermore it is pointed out that the application of this equation ranges from low solid volume fractions as pertaining to fibrous porous media of solid volume fraction ϕ 0 12 to relatively high solid volume fraction for more compact porous media giving that the vertical models of ϕ 0 03 were constructed with free zone depths less than the porous medium inter rod distance l the curve fits show that eq 2 may be used not only in a porous medium free flowcoupled flow but generally for flows bounded by varying porous media in 2 it was pointed out that a more practical utility of eq 2 is the derivation of a boundary condition eq 9 applicable in the analyses of the flow at a two domain macroscopic level in fig 14 plots of ub q against utop q in a general plot fig 14a are provided for each porous medium fig 14b c d they are linear as suggested in eq 13 and give credence to the fact that by merely measuring global parameters such as the pressure gradient the average velocity through and above the porous medium ub β and the macroscopic profile may be obtained it is to be noted however from eq 6 fig 15 and summaries in table 4 that the parameter β is a complex function that is dependent on the reynolds number of the flow at the onset of inertia it appears that inertial effects at the interface are more dominant at lower solid volume fraction thus for vertical models the change in β as reynolds number increases from 0 8 to 8 increases by margins up to 180 when ϕ 0 03 but is only 8 when ϕ 0 12 and the reynolds number increases from 1 to 7 it is also important to note that inertia changes are also a factor of the porous medium type a comparison of the porous media indicates that inertia changes are least 8 for vertical models and most substantial 42 in horizontal models these observations suggest then that the greater surface resistance offered by the porous medium at the projected interfacial plane the greater the inertial effects 5 3 apparent viscosity in line with expectations from a mesoscopic level of description the apparent viscosity μ for each test model was found to vary at the transitional interfacial zone to a constant value within the porous medium values of this viscosity at the interface μ o and within the porous medium μ are reported in fig 16 and table 4 there are four noteworthy observations that can be made from the results in the first place the apparent viscosity increases with reynolds number indeed at the interface where high flow persists along with the dominating effects of inertia increment in reynolds number results in up to 100 changes in the apparent viscosities even within the porous medium where inertial effects are relatively subdued the increase in reynolds number still leads to up to 45 changes in apparent viscosity values a second observation that cannot be missed is that the apparent viscosity values reduce by decades with changes in location from the porous free zone interface to depths within the same porous medium this is a significant but not a surprising phenomenon giving that the prominence of location effects is predicted in the variable apparent viscosity model shown in eq 5 the third point that may be made is that the apparent viscosity tends to decrease with decreasing solid volume fraction or increasing equivalent permeability this is also consistent with the variable apparent permeability model given in eq 5 consequently it may be noted fourthly that the apparent viscosities vary significantly with model porous media type compared to the other models the mesh models which are the most permeable of all the three models record the least values of apparent viscosity the foregoing observations thus reinforce the idea that the apparent viscosity is indeed a complex parameter that is a function of both porous media and flow parameters in a porous medium free flow coupled flow this parameter is responsible for diffusing the macroscopic heterogeneities in the velocity scales of the flow as the flow transitions from the free zone to the porous medium for this reason its value is highest at the interface and inertial zones where it is required for viscous diffusion and its value is least at zones where inertia is relatively low in porous medium free flow coupled flow arrangements where the porous medium is of high permeability and there is a low heterogeneity between the free zone flow and the porous medium flow the apparent viscosity is expectedly relatively low on the other hand in arrangements where the porous medium is of low permeability and therefore the disparity between free zone and porous medium flow is larger the apparent viscosity is higher as sahraoui and kaviany 1992 also used a variable model for flow through and over horizontal model porous media a note of comparison of that result with the current data is necessary in contrast to the present observations the numerical simulations of sahraoui and kaviany 1992 showed local apparent viscosity distributions that increased with depth into the medium they also noted that the apparent viscosity decreased with increasing solid volume fraction the reason for this marked difference in their result from the present data lies in the distinctively different apparent viscosity models applied in either work 5 4 boundary layer parameters in 2 it was asserted that the streamwise flow at the edge of the porous medium may be seen as a boundary layer the study of the boundary layer beneath the interface is of particular importance noting that it provides an important value of flow penetrating into the porous medium as well as the deficits in mass and momentum due to the presence of a porous medium in a plain flow in this regard then it is important to study the behavior of the boundary layer thickness δ the displacement thickness δ and the momentum thickness θ these are defined in eqs 6 to 8 and experimentally measured and presented in table 4 and fig 17 it is difficult to clearly decipher the nature of δ from eq 6 given the unpredictable nature of p and d however it is clearly a factor of q and therefore the reynolds number of the local flow using the experimental values of δ obtained by assuming a linear interpolation between the spatially averaged piv data values it was found that δ which is also a measure of the depth of penetration is at least twice that of kv for the test models the horizontal models recorded the highest values of δ furthermore δ tended to reduce with increasing solid volume fraction thus it may be inferred that the presence solid surfaces due to the increasing complexity or the compactness of the porous medium essentially helps in the decay of the free zone velocity as it penetrates through the porous medium while δ appears to be affected by inertia its trend is not clear it is expected that mass and momentum deficits indicated respectively by δ and θ of the free zone flow will increase due flow retardation caused by the presence of the porous medium eqs 7 and 8 however indicate that an increase in the mean filter velocity in the porous medium q leads to a decrease in both mass and momentum deficits thus as confirmed in the test data the increase in the local reynolds number in the porous medium from 1 to 7 results in as much as 108 reduction in mass flow deficit and reduction momentum deficits the highest cuts in deficits are observed in the mesh model an examination of the shape parameter h δ θ as summarized in table 4 indicates that the momentum flux of the flow increases at the expense of mass flux as the local reynolds number increases from 1 to 10 6 conclusion the focus of this work has been to characterize the flow through and over porous media at the onset of inertia this has been done using analytical deductions volume averaged piv measurements and numerical simulations of flow through and over complex porous media models the following conclusions may be drawn from this study the momentum equation for the inertial flow at bulk reynolds number between 1 and 10 has been confirmed to be essentially brinkman in form however that equation is associated with a variable model of the apparent viscosity and an equivalent permeability that prevails in the forchheimer regime the apparent viscosity is a complex parameter that is a function of both porous media and flow parameters in aporous medium free flow coupled flow this parameter appears to be responsible for diffusing the macroscopic heterogeneities in the velocity scales of the flow as the flow transitions from the free zone to the porous medium for this reason its value is highest at the interface and inertial zones and its value is least at zones where inertia is relatively low additionally the apparent viscosity tends to decrease with increasing equivalent permeability and least in the most permeable porous media using the sigmoidal velocity profile at the edge of the medium a boundary condition equivalent to that of beavers and joseph 1967 may be obtained a constant associated with this condition β and other factors that can be obtained from bulk measurements and other relations and these may be used to solve the macroscopic two domain porous medium free zone flow an examination of the bulk flow apparent viscosity boundary condition empirical constant and relevant boundary layer parameters indicates that for porous medium free flow coupled flows the interface is the porous media zone that is affected most by reynolds number changes as inertia sets in given the range of complexity of porous media tested it is expected that these conclusions will also apply to real isotropic porous media these results are expected to provide tools for analytical and numerical validations and prediction of interfacial flow pertaining to isotropic porous media 7 author statement this author james kofi arthur is solely responsible for the conceptualization

392,fractures in geological formations constitute high conductivity conduits which potentially act as preferential paths during fluid injection in soil remediation and reservoir engineering operations recently the measurement of the pressure drop under different flow rates during the flow of yield stress fluids in porous media has been proposed as the basis for an environmentally friendly method to characterize the pore size distribution however the yield stress fluids porosimetry method ysm has still not been extended to the characterization of the hydraulic aperture distribution of rough walled rock fractures the potential interest of such an extension is intense considering that the distinct characteristics of rock fractures vs the matrix represent a burden to other traditional porosimetry techniques in the particular case of x ray microtomography time consuming calibration is often needed and serious difficulties arise due to beam hardening and reconstruction artifacts the specific objective of the present investigation is to adapt ysm to the characterization of rough walled rock fractures for this purpose the results of laboratory experiments in which a yield stress fluid was injected through two natural rock fractures were exploited and the ysm model and algorithm was adapted to the particular topological and geometrical features of flows in fractures moreover numerical experiments were performed at the scale of a single 2d channel with variable aperture to identify the dimension characterized by ysm and decipher the yielding behaviour of the fluids the present findings show that ysm can be successfully used to characterize the distribution of hydraulic apertures of the flow channels in rough walled rock fractures furthermore the numerical results revealed that the plug of stagnant fluid is located in the central part of these flow channels and breaks close to the constrictions forming islands of unyielded fluid 1 introduction flow through fractured porous media plays a major role in various fields of geosciences including reservoir exploitation for water supply transport of contaminants from subsurface repositories geological isolation of nuclear waste underground storage of co2 mineralization processes mining petroleum engineering and geothermal systems berkowitz 2002 berre et al 2019 javadi et al 2010 given that the permeability of the fracture is orders of magnitude higher than that of the rock in which it is formed the fracture acts as a high conductivity conduit from the surrounding reservoir towards the producing well in enhanced oil recovery among other applications this raises a central issue in the specific case of soil remediation operations in which the displacing liquid may bypass the contaminated matrix if a natural fracture network is hit during injection lavrov 2013a a great number of yield stress fluids are commonly used as both displacing fluids to enhance mobility ratio and blocking agents to divert flow from highly permeable regions e g polymer solutions slurries foams and microemulsion kovscek and bertin 2003 silva et al 2012 di cristo et al 2019 forey et al 2020 omirbekov et al 2020 consequently it is of crucial importance to understand the flow behaviour of yield stress fluids as they enter fractures that are rough walled by nature on this subject frigaard et al 2017 reviewed the extensive use of yield stress fluids in oil and gas industry including the flow through fractured media as reviewed by birdsell et al 2015 hydraulic fracturing is a source of environmental concern due among other issues to the potential upward migration of the fracturing fluids to shallow drinking water aquifers through permeable pathways such as existing fractures such fracturing fluids often exhibit a yield stress therefore generating extra motivation for investigating the flow of yield stress fluids in fractured media fracture wall surfaces are rough and do not perfectly match generating voids of different sizes and spatial heterogeneity of the flow field auradou et al 2006 for this reason the accurate evaluation of fracture hydro mechanical properties relies heavily on the knowledge of the aperture distribution ad i e the distribution of perpendicular distances between asperities on adjacent fracture surfaces which serve as fluid flow paths dang et al 2019 li et al 2020 by analogy with a homogeneous porous medium the ad of the fracture can be considered as being its pore size distribution psd as the flow channels of varying aperture can be assimilated to individual pores huo et al 2016 listed 10 methods for measuring fracture apertures together with their main advantages and drawbacks as presented in table 1 among these methods the popular non destructive computed tomography method presents the serious shortcoming of needing calibration johns et al 1993 weerakone and wong 2010 lai et al 2017 in its conventional version which is a time consuming task and generally difficult to achieve on fracture networks voorn et al 2015 moreover the use of x ray micro computed tomography tests to characterize the psd of fractured media is challenging given the disparity between the dimensions of the fracture apertures and the size of the pores in the rock li et al 2017 indeed different requirements in terms of spatial resolution need to be met for the fracture and the host rock also the thin samples that are used in x ray micro computed tomography may not be representative of the heterogeneity of fractured media a great number of previous works exist dealing with the application of x ray to characterize the microstructure of porous media and the details on the advantages and limitations of this technique can be consulted in the literature lindquist and venkatarangan 2000 burlion et al 2006 prodanovic et al 2006 karpyn et al 2007 wildenschild and sheppard 2012 bultreys et al 2016 li et al 2017 houston et al 2017 tembely et al 2019 regarding the methods for fracture aperture characterization based on surface topography measurements resin injection and casting techniques hakami et al 1995 presented a review in which the advantages and shortcomings of each method were critically discussed as explained by these authors the preceding methods are intended for research purposes as in field mapping for site characterisation the measurements must be quicker and simpler the injection of yield stress fluids in porous media was first proposed as a potential method for porosimetry by ambari et al 1990 in that work it was shown that the psd of porous media can be derived from the measurement of flow rate q vs pressure gradient p during injection of a yield stress fluid through a sample of the investigated material the medium was modelled as an equivalent bundle of straight cylindrical capillaries of circular cross section with different radii providing the same flow rate vs pressure gradient relationship as the actual sample although the method was first proposed only for bingham fluids it was extended to casson and herschel bulkley fluids in subsequent works oukhlef 2011 oukhlef et al 2014 moreover oukhlef et al 2014 performed a set of numerical experiments with yield stress fluids in which the psds of bundles of capillaries were successfully computed from the analytical inversion of the generated q vs p datasets some major drawbacks of such inversion procedure were its deep sensitivity to experimental uncertainty and the noisy results obtained in the small pore size region in an attempt to solve these issues malvault 2013 proposed a procedure to achieve numerical inversion of q vs p data obtained from laboratory experiments nevertheless the accuracy of the results was highly dependent on the choice of the order of the polynomial fitting required to invert the experimental data the preceding contributions and theoretical concepts constituted the starting point for the development of the yield stress porosimetry method ysm which was presented by rodríguez de castro et al 2014 as a clean alternative to toxic mercury intrusion porosimetry león y león 1998 giesche 2006 cieszko et al 2019 the inversion algorithm followed in ysm uses the raw experimental data as input without any filtering or interpolation this was accomplished by identifying the contribution in terms of flow rate occurring only in the pores of decreasing size in which the fluid yields when the pressure gradient is steeply increased then from this new contribution the number of pores of the incorporated pore size class can be determined ysm was successfully applied to characterize the psds of both synthetic and natural consolidated porous media rodríguez de castro et al 2016 2018 more recently rodríguez de castro et al 2019 characterized the psds of unconsolidated packs of spherical beads by using ysm the preceding work showed that the results of ysm were essentially identical to those provided by mercury intrusion porosimetry also the comparison of ysm results with pore network models proved that the pore dimension being characterized by ysm is closer to the pore constriction rather than the pore body however rough walled fractures constitute a distinct type of pores given that the distance between the walls of the fracture i e the aperture is much lower than the width and the length of the fracture moreover in many fractures both walls come into contact zero aperture only at a limited number of points consequently the interstices are composed of a set of wide pores with varying aperture in between the contact points rather than being a network of interconnected smaller pores as is the case in common porous media such as rocks or sand packs for this reason the bundle of cylindrical capillaries model used when applying ysm to traditional porous media needs to be adapted to the geometrical and topological particularities of fractures the previous contributions to the development of a method to characterize the pore size distributions of porous media through the injection of complex fluids are summarized in the supplementary material of the present article table s1 until now ysm has only been applied to isotropic porous media the objective of the present investigation is to extend the use of ysm to the characterization of rough walled rock fractures in terms of their hydraulic aperture distribution had in order to fulfil this objective a model is first proposed to provide a suitable representation of the flow of yield stress fluids through this particular porous structure then a set of previously published experiments in which a yield stress fluid is injected through two replicas of real rock fractures are used as input to ysm algorithm in order to obtain the had additionally several 2d numerical simulations are performed to gain further insight into the characteristic aperture controlling the generation of pressure losses and therefore the ysm measurements in fractures the conclusions of the current study are critically discussed allowing the evaluation of ysm as an efficient method to characterize rough walled rock fractures 2 application of yield stress fluids porosimetry method to rough walled rock fractures in this section the porous medium model and the fluid rheology considered in the extension of ysm method to rough walled rock fractures are presented together with the underlying assumptions and the algorithm used to extract the had 2 1 modelling the flow of yield stress fluids through rough fractures the steady state shear rheology of the yield stress fluids used in the ysm method is described by herschel bulkley s law eq 1 under the assumption of simple shear conditions 1 τ τ 0 k γ n for τ τ 0 γ 0 for τ τ 0 in this model τ0 is the yield stress k is the consistency and n is the power law index of the fluid these rheological parameters are determined by fitting τ vs γ data obtained with a controlled stress rheometer neuzil and tracy 1981 tsang and tsang 1987 and silliman 1989 proposed simplified fracture models with 1 d aperture variability in which the total newtonian flow through a rough walled fracture is considered to be the sum of a set of elementary flows through plate channels of different apertures this type of model was subsequently extended to power law fluid flows di federico 1998 and more recently to the flow of truncated power law fluids felisa et al 2018 using a similar approach auradou et al 2006 presented a simple model in which the aperture field is replaced by a set of parallel channels each of constant aperture and perpendicular to the direction of shear displacement in shear displaced fractures exhibiting self affine geometries in the preceding work the authors showed that for a mean flow parallel to these channels the fluid streamlines are only weakly tortuous and the variations in their velocity along these flow paths are small compared to the velocity contrasts from one channel to another for each channel the velocity of the fluid was related to the pressure gradient by darcy s equation in a subsequent work auradou et al 2008 the width and geometry of the front of a dyed shear thinning polymer solution displacing a transparent solution of the same composition were studied as a function of the fluid rheology and flow rate observing low transverse mixing between the flow paths and showing hence that the fracture could be considered as a set of parallel ducts of constant hydraulic apertures also their results showed that the flow velocity contrasts between different flow channels was more significant for shear thinning fluids than for newtonian fluids the newtonian hydraulic aperture of a rough walled fracture hn is defined as the aperture of a hele shaw cell producing the same pressure loss as the actual rough walled fracture under any flow rate for the injection of a newtonian fluid therefore in the model used in the current work the void space between the walls of a rough fracture is discretized in a bundle of z straight parallel flow channels with rectangular cross section of widths wi and apertures hi with i ranging from 1 to z a schematic representation of this model is provided in fig 1 the transverse flow between channels may be considered as negligible auradou et al 2008 therefore one dimensional flow is considered within each flow channel the wall effects are neglected over the width direction and slipping condition is assumed between neighbour flow channels as displayed in fig 1 c in this regard lavrov 2013b numerically showed that a strong channelization of the flow occurs during the injection of shear thinning fluids through rough walled fractures this means that the flow rate contribution in the direction of the applied pressure gradient is much larger than the flow rate contribution perpendicular to the global direction of the flow as a consequence of the very high effective viscosity values exhibited by this type of fluids at small pressure gradients it is to be noted that such a simple model is not expected to represent the actual geometry and topology but only the characteristic dimensions determining the pressure losses through the real rock fracture therefore the total flow rate q through the fracture can be written as 2 q p i 1 z w i q p h i where p δp l is the absolute value of the pressure gradient δp is the absolute value of the pressure drop between the inlet and the outlet of the fracture l is the length of the straight channels hi are the different representative flow channel aperture classes and wi is the width of each flow channel in the preceding equation the wi hi data correspond to the flow channel hydraulic aperture distribution had of the investigated rough walled fracture and q p hi is the individual flow rate per unit width in a rectangular channel of aperture hi under a pressure gradient p in the case of creeping one dimensional flow of a newtonian fluid of shear viscosity μ q δp hi is given by hele shaw s equation 3 q p h i h i 3 12 μ p t with t being the hydraulic tortuosity and p being the magnitude of the pressure gradient in the flow direction based on the results of previous experiments shojaei et al 2019 which reported low tortuosity of the streamlines during the flow of yield stress fluids in a typical rock fracture the rectangular flow channels were considered to be perfectly straight in the present model t 1 whereas hi is known to be equal to the hydraulic aperture for newtonian fluids this equivalency is still to be proved in the case of yield stress fluids proving such equivalency will be the scope of the numerical simulations presented in section 3 of the present manuscript for a herschel bulkley fluid the q p hi relationships are given by skelland 1967 chhabra and richardson 2008 ferrás et al 2012 4 q p h i 2 n n 1 p k 1 n h i h 2 h i 2 h 0 2 1 1 n n h i 2 h 0 2 2 1 n 1 2 n 0 for h i h 0 for h i h 0 with h0 2τ0 p being the threshold aperture which represent the aperture of a flow channel below which no flow occurs under the considered pressure gradient obviously for τ0 0 n 1 and k µ eq 4 becomes identical to eq 3 2 2 computation of aperture distribution by using ysm the details of the algorithm used to compute the psd of a porous sample from the raw flow rate vs pressure gradient data qi pi collected during injection of a yield stress fluid were provided by rodríguez de castro et al 2014 2016 2018 hence only the essential features of the method and the procedure used to extend ysm to the case of rough walled fractures are presented in this section in order to characterize the hydraulic aperture distribution of a rough walled rock fracture with ysm an experiment must be performed that allows the collection of a set of qi pi data with qi being the total flow rate through the fracture these steady state measurements are performed during the injection of a herschel bulkley fluid through the investigated fracture the number of collected data couples is z 1 i 1 z 1 from the z 1 measurements a set of z representative flow channel apertures are defined as 5 h j α 2 τ 0 p j j 1 z it must be taken into account that flow under a given pressure gradient pj only occurs in channels with an aperture strictly larger than 2 τ 0 p j consequently the value of the numerical factor α in eq 5 must be greater than unity a full description of the procedure followed to compute the value of α was presented in the literature rodríguez de castro et al 2014 and is adapted to the case of fractures in the present section with the objective of extending ysm method to rough walled rock fractures it is first assumed that the bundle of z straight parallel flow channels with rectangular cross sectional areas presented in subsection 2 1 is capable of accurately predicting the relationship between flow rate and generated pressure losses then the width wj of the flow channel with aperture hj is calculated as being the maximum positive value of wj for which the following condition is respected 6 q s g 1 j w g q p s h g for s j 1 where q ps hg is given by eq 4 the width w1 of the flow channel with the largest aperture h1 is first determined by solving the system of inequations 6 for s 2 then w2 was calculated for s 3 and then the width of the flow channels of smaller and smaller aperture are computed until wz the width of the flow channel with the smallest aperture is calculated at the end of this process a set of hj wj data is obtained from these results the relative frequency p hj of each flow channel aperture class hj is given by 7 p h j h j w j i 1 z h i w i the suitable value of α named α is calculated as follows first α 1 is used to calculate the hj wj data and the total width of the flow channels i 1 z w i is computed then the same procedure is repeated by successively increasing the value of α with a scanning step of δ δ 0 1 was used in the present work until the hj wj data corresponding to α 2 has been calculated α is selected as being the value of α that minimizes the absolute value of the difference between the actual width of the fracture w and the calculated one i e w i 1 z w i from the computed hj wj data the calculated macroscopic relationship between the total flow rate through the fracture q and the pressure gradient p can be obtained using eq 2 it must be borne in mind that flow channels with large apertures contribute more significantly to the total flow rate hence the scanning procedure to calculate each wj should be more refined when the considered aperture is large for this reason the step used in the scanning procedure different from δ is defined as stepj ζq pz 1 hz q pz 1 hj where ζ is a coefficient that quantifies the refinement of scanning ζ 0 05 w was used in the considered experiments 3 numerical simulation of the flow of yield stress fluids through 2d rough walled rock fractures a set of 2d numerical simulations were performed in order to gain further insight into the physical meaning of the had provided by ysm in the case of rough walled rock fractures a key objective was to identify the regions of the fracture where most pressure drops were generated during the injection of yield stress fluids and their correlation with the hydraulic aperture as determined for newtonian fluids 3 1 investigated media karpyn et al 2007 conducted x ray microtomography experiments in order to map the internal structure of an artificially induced rough fracture in a berea sandstone which was oriented parallel to the natural bedding of the rock the results of such x ray microtomography experiments are freely available karpyn et al 2016 from the reconstructed fracture geometry the four segmented 2d slices displayed in fig 2 were used in the present work as an input to the numerical simulations moreover the bonej algorithm doube et al 2010 included in the open source image processing software imagej schindelin et al 2012 was used to determine the local aperture map of the 2d slices then a first set of newtonian direct numerical simulations was performed to determine the newtonian hydraulic aperture hn of these 2d slices the hn values are also given in fig 2 it can be seen that all the 2d slices present a wide range of local apertures and the value of hn is strongly affected by the presence of narrow constrictions as expected from the important pressure losses produced in these regions 3 2 the procedure for numerical experiments numerical simulations are commonly used to study the characteristics of flow systems whose mathematical models are too tedious to provide analytical solutions as it is the case of the flow of yield stress fluids through real rough walled fractures hewitt et al 2016 chaparian and tamiasola 2020 full 3d cfd simulations of this type of flows can become prohibitively expensive in terms of computational resources given that the two in plane dimensions of the fracture are much larger than the fracture aperture in order to avoid the computational cost of a fully 3d approach morris et al 2015 developed a simulator for the flow of power law bingham and herschel bulkley fluids through fractures by introducing a 2d aperture averaged analytic solution and compared the results to those obtained for a 3d model implemented in a commercial code these authors showed that the 2 d model was capable of predicting the location of the fluids in non mixing flows also for the first time zhang et al 2019 carried out 3d numerical simulations of the flow of shear thinning fluids without yield stress through a rough walled rock fracture by extracting the input geometry from a computed microtomography image recently rodríguez de castro and agnaou 2019 and rodríguez de castro et al 2020 performed numerical simulations that provided the velocity and viscosity maps for a herschel bulkley fluid flowing in a set of 2d porous media these media consisted of real and idealized packings of particles of various shapes and sizes following the procedure described in these previous works the finite element based numerical simulation software comsol multiphysics version 5 3 2017 was used in the present study to solve the flow problems under interest analogously to the work of bauer et al 2019 stokes flow was considered in the numerical simulations and the following equations were solved 0 π p with π being thethe deviatoric stress tensor and p being the pressure for a herschel bulkley fluid π can be written as follows π i j 2 μ δ i j where δ is the strain rate tensor i e δ i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i with u being the velocity vector and xi xj being the spatial coordinates a generalized shear rate γ can be defined by using einstein s summation convention γ 2 δ i j δ i j the following model was implemented to quantify the local viscosity of the yield stress fluid μ min μ max k γ n 1 τ 0 γ where μmax corresponds to a maximum viscosity the herschel bulkley shear rheology parameters of the investigated fluid were τ0 10 pa k 1 pa sn and n 0 5 a value μmax 10000 pa s was selected as a compromise between numerical stability and accuracy indeed using extremely high μmax values results in large viscosity gradients within the computational domain and instabilities on the other hand low μmax values fail to emulate a yield stress the chosen value of μmax corresponds to shear rates lower than γ 10 3s 1 further details on the viscosity regularisation methods for visco plastic fluid flow computation were provided in the literature frigaard and nouar 2005 the computational domain which is a 2d section of a fracture as shown in fig 2 was discretized using unstructured meshes composed of triangular element faces the elementary control volumes are defined around each node joining the centres of mesh elements the values obtained at mesh nodes are interpolated based on a linear lagrangian interpolation for the pressure whereas a quadratic interpolation is adopted for the velocity components the creeping flow module designed for solving stokes flows was used for each 2d geometry various inlet pressures were imposed as boundary conditions while keeping the outlet pressure equal to 0 and the corresponding steady state total flow rates per unit width m2 s were computed the non linear system of equations was solved using the comsol stationary solver the solution is sought by making use of a newton raphson algorithm that starts with the initial conditions as an initial guess the solution is considered converged upon reaching a residual below a relative tolerance of 10 3 within each newton raphson iteration the resulting system of linearized equations is solved using the direct solver pardiso schenk 2004 simulations are initiated with the fluid at rest to go further the influence of the chosen μmax value was also evaluated by comparing the results obtained by using the original μmax 10000 pa s value and a ten times greater μmax 100000 pa s value in the case of the 2d geometry with hydraulic aperture hn 372 µm and imposing an inlet pressure of 3000 pa the smallest one under consideration the observed differences in terms of both the average shear rate and the total flow rate per unit width used in ysm algorithm were negligible 1 20 and 2 2 respectively as reported by lavrov 2013a it is sometimes advantageous to replace a real rough walled fracture with an equivalent fracture with parallel smooth walls when incorporating fluid flow through fractures into higher level models such as reservoir simulators in this regard the equivalent aperture heq di federico 1997 1998 is defined as the aperture of a fracture with parallel smooth walls that would exhibit the same flow rate under a given applied pressure gradient as the real rough walled rock fracture in the case of newtonian flow heq hn for any considered pressure gradient tsang 1992 discussed the differences between the numerous definitions and notations of fracture apertures showing that the hydraulic aperture and the aperture obtained from tracer tests should not be assimilated in this respect tracer tests were performed by nowamooz et al 2013 in the same two fractures that will be investigated in the current work the distribution of local permeabilities were computed from the results of the tracer tests assuming a stratified medium model which required image processing stages and calibration regarding the determination of the hydraulic apertures of rock fractures borehole pumping tests were used by other authors for this purpose barton et al 1985 as listed in table 1 also cao et al 2016 stated that knowledge of the hydraulic aperture distribution had of a fracture is urgently needed in engineering construction and analytical models at the engineering field scale in the same work the authors presented a method for the measurement of had based on in situ camera measurements combined with borehole water pressure tests and discussed the relationships between hydraulic aperture and mechanical aperture from eq 4 the following expression can be written to calculate the equivalent apertures heq of the 2d considered flow channels from the numerically computed qj pj data for each imposed value of pj 8 q j p j h eq 2 n n 1 p j k 1 n h eq 2 h eq 2 h 0 2 1 1 n n h eq 2 h 0 2 2 1 n 1 2 n 0 for h eq h 0 for h eq h 0 eq 8 can be numerically solved to obtain heq for example this was achieved by using the differential evolution method in the present work it is noted that in contrast to the constant value of hn heq cannot be safely assumed to be constant for different values of pj in the case of yield stress fluids given the non linear relationship between flow rate and pressure gradient according to eq 2 the relationship wq p h n i 1 z w i q p h n i can be expressed as w h n 3 12 μ p t i 1 z w i h n i 3 12 μ p t for the injection of a newtonian fluid so w h n 3 i 1 z w i h n i 3 with w i 1 z w i and hn i being the newtonian hydraulic aperture of each flow channel given that yield stress fluids are used in ysm the question that arises is whether hn i is still representative of the characteristic aperture that should be used in the bundle model so as to accurately predict the relationship between flow rate and pressure loss in other words is i 1 z w i q p h n i still equivalent to the total flow rate wq p heq through a rough walled fracture for the injection of a herschel bulkley fluid to answer this question it will be first considered that each 2d fracture used in the present numerical experiments can be assimilated to an individual flow channel traversed by the yield stress fluid during its flow through a real fracture providing a representation of the evolving aperture of such flow channel throughout the medium then the equivalent aperture heq of a constant section flow channel providing the same pressure loss flow rate relationship as the actual 2d geometries presented in fig 2 for a wide range of flow rates will be computed from the results of the numerical experiments with herschel bulkley fluids finally the values of heq computed for the 2d geometries will be compared to the corresponding values of hn to assess the closeness of both quantities it should be highlighted that the objective of the current numerical simulations is not to assimilate the microscopic mechanisms arising during the flow of yield stress fluids through real 3d fractures to the mechanisms arising in a 2d geometry indeed significant differences exist between the 2d and the 3d cases in particular a preferential flow channel with higher flow rate than the one produced in the constrictions can be formed in 3d rough walled rock fractures in contrast the highest flow velocities are located in the constricted zones in the case of 2d channels as will be shown in subsection 5 1 4 experimental flow of yield stress fluids through rough walled rock fractures rodríguez de castro and radilla 2017 carried out flow rate vs pressure gradient measurements during the injection of a yield stress fluid through two well characterized rough walled rock fractures in this section the full experimental data set obtained by these authors is used as an input to the ysm algorithm to compute the had of both fractures 4 1 investigated media experimental works dealing with the injection of yield stress fluids in rough walled fractures are scarce rodríguez de castro and radilla 2017 shojaei et al 2019 rodríguez de castro and radilla 2017 conducted a set of laboratory experiments in which a concentrated polymer solution exhibiting a yield stress was injected through two transparent epoxy resin replicas of a granite fracture and a vosges sandstone fracture the details of the procedure followed for the fabrication of these fracture replicas are available elsewhere isakov et al 2001 nowamooz et al 2013 the width w total length permeability k newtonian hydraulic aperture hn and mechanical aperture arithmetic average hm of both fractures are listed in table 2 the aperture maps were previously obtained by nowamooz et al 2013 by means of an image processing procedure based on the attenuation of a light source following the law of beer lambert and are displayed in fig 3 for both fractures the smallest apertures are located in the central part and the largest apertures are located near the inlet and the outlet moreover the apertures of the vosges sandstone fracture are more variable at the lower half than at the upper half while the spatial variability appears to be relatively high across the entire granite fracture area as showed in the work of nowamooz et al 2013 the constrictions in the central part of these fractures constituted a barrier to fluid flow especially in the case of shear thinning and yield stress fluids as the pressure loss sensitivity to aperture is higher than for a newtonian one roustaei et al 2016 on this subject shojaei et al 2019 experimentally determined the velocity map of a yield stress fluid flowing through the same vosges sandstone fracture and characterized the apparent shear rheology of the fluid the characterization of the velocity map was achieved by performing a particle image velocimetry piv analysis on a set of images obtained during the flow of a pre generated foam exhibiting a yield stress through the transparent replica in order to monitor the position of the bubbles at different times the authors showed that the aperture variation strongly affects the apparent viscosity of the foam and the velocity contrast between preferential flow channels and stagnant zones 4 2 experimental setup and fluid properties the signature of had in the flow rate vs pressure gradient curve is only present at low flow rates for which the fluid remains unyielded in a fragment of the fracture i e in some of the flow channels depending on the applied pressure gradient given that this signature needs to be present in the q vs p data used as input to ysm algorithm the particularly wide range of flow rates 3 6 orders of magnitude imposed in the experiments of rodríguez de castro and radilla 2017 is suitable for its use in ysm algorithm the experimental setup and procedure presented in the following lines corresponds to the one used by these authors the calibration of the yield stress fluid was discussed in previous works rodríguez de castro et al 2018 xanthan gum aqueous solutions were selected due not only to their low degree of viscoelasticity and their negligible thixotropic behaviour but also to their environmentally friendly nature the herschel bulkley parameters of injected fluid were τ0 7 36 pa k 0 365 pa sn and n 0 52 the shear rheology of the xanthan solutions used in the present experiments was characterized by means of a stress controlled rheometer equipped with a cone plate geometry all rheological measurements were performed at 20 c by applying shear stresses linearly sampled from 0 to a maximum value producing a shear rate of approximately 1000 s 1 the τj γ j experimental data presented by rodríguez de castro and radilla 2017 were fitted to a herschel bulkley law by minimizing the sum j 1 n τ 0 k γ j n τ j 2 γ j with n being the number of τj γ j data by doing so the values of the yield stress τ0 the power law index n and the consistency k were determined the square of the difference between τj and τ 0 k γ j n was weighted by γ j following the procedure presented by rodríguez de castro et al 2014 moreover a set of effluent fluid samples were collected at the outlet of the fractures after injection at the highest flow rate the effluent rheograms were determined and compared to that of the inflowing fluid in order to assess polymer degradation retention of the polymer on the fracture walls and the constancy of the rheological parameters during all the experiments no significant difference was observed between the rheograms so polymer degradation and polymer retention were proved to be negligible the results also showed that the variation in the values of the herschel bulkley parameters over the set of experiments was not significant two different experimental setups were used depending on the injection flow rates for the low and moderate flow rates ranging from 1 67 10 8 to 1 67 10 6 m3 s an open injection circuit was used in which the aqueous polymer solution was injected through the fracture at a flow rate imposed by a dual piston pump for the highest flow rates ranging from 2 50 10 6 to 6 94 10 5 m3 s the circuit was closed in this second configuration a volumetric pump was used to inject the yield stress fluid from a tank situated upstream of the rough walled rock fracture and the fluid was continuously recirculated to the tank from the outlet of the fracture also a positive displacement flow meter was installed at the outlet of the volumetric pump to measure the injection flow rate in both configurations the pressure drop was measured with a differential pressure sensor over a distance of l 20 5 cm for the vosges sandstone fracture and l 27 cm for the granite fracture the range of the pressure sensor was adjusted by installing different membranes from 0 1400 pa to 0 56 000 pa with an accuracy of 0 3 of the full scale the range of the piston pump was from 1 67 10 9 to 1 67 10 6 m3 s with an accuracy of 2 while the range of the flow meter installed at the outlet of the volumetric pump was from 1 94 10 6 to 1 38 10 4 m3 s with an accuracy of 1 4 3 experimental procedure both rough walled fractures were saturated with co2 more water miscible gas than air prior to saturation with the yield stress fluid to avoid the formation of gas bubbles during the measurements then the fractures were fully saturated with the yield stress fluid which was subsequently injected at 45 different flow rates ranging from 1 67 10 9 to 4 72 10 5 m3 s through the granite fracture and at 38 flow rates that lie between 3 33 10 9 m3 s and 2 78 10 5 m3 s through the vosges sandstone fracture in each series the flow rate was steeply increased and the corresponding steady state pressure drop was measured each measurement was repeated four times and the uncertainty related to the repeatability was calculated as 2σ with σ being an estimate of the relative standard deviation of the measurements 95 confidence interval all experiments were performed at t 20 1 c it is highlighted that the minimum number of experiments required to obtain an hydraulic aperture distribution with an acceptable level of accuracy in ysm depends on the statistical dispersion of the microstructural dimensions of the characterized sample more dispersed samples require more measurements this statistical dispersion is unknown a priori unless some microstructural information is known beforehand this issue also arises in the case of other porosimetry methods such as mip and x ray microtomography techniques in particular the choice of minimum resolution in a microtomography measurement is often challenging nevertheless for the case of ysm experiments some general guidelines and recommendations can be made it should be ensured that the maximum flow rate imposed during the experiments qmax is adequate to make the yield stress fluid flow through all the channels of the rough walled fracture as explained in subsection 5 3 the preceding condition is respected if the fit of the data points at the highest flow rates leads to a power law of p with an exponent of 1 n the minimum flow rate imposed during the experiments qmin should be as low as possible and is given in practice by the technical limitations of the experimental setup however it must be checked that the value 2 τ 0 p min is close to the largest hydraulic aperture sizes expected in the characterized fracture rodríguez de castro 2014 tested different sampling procedures for ysm in order to evaluate their suitability based on the results reported in this previous work it is recommended that during each experiment a set of different flow rates qj j 1 z 1 should be imposed to the injected the yield stress fluid following the sequence below q j q min q max q min z 1 i z based on the previous experimental and numerical works listed in table s1 of the supplementary material in which ysm was used to characterize high and moderate permeability samples it is recommended that the number of experimental data z 1 should be greater than 30 however the accuracy of the obtained had is expected to be improved by increasing the number of measurements 5 results 5 1 numerical results velocity and viscosity maps some examples of the velocity maps obtained by performing the numerical simulations presented in subsection 3 2 are presented in fig 4 showing the existence of a wide range of velocities within a single 2d channel with much higher velocity values in the constrictions of the fracture and lower velocity values in the vicinity of the walls as expected it is highlighted that the extension of the high velocity regions warmer colours in fig 4 is greater for the 2d flow channels of greater hydraulic apertures mitsoulis and huilgol 2004 numerically investigated the flow of bingham fluids through conduits with an abrupt expansion their results showed that the plug region of unyielded fluid breaks at the location of the drastic aperture change resulting in the formation of blobs of unyielded material in the corners of the expansion the size of such blobs increases by decreasing the injection flow rates as bingham number increases de souza mendes et al 2007 also showed that unyielded regions appear first in the corners of an abrupt expansion whereas for the smooth geometries of roustaei and frigaard 2013 unyielded fluid was first observed in the deepest part of the channel i e with the highest aperture the viscosity maps computed from the numerical experiments performed in the 2d fracture with hn 372 µm are presented in fig 5 for different values of the imposed pressure drop this 2d fracture presents important aperture variations with a central constricted area fig 5 shows that the plug breaks close to the constriction in the low local aperture zones forming islands of unyielded fluid also the fluid remains unyielded in the corners of the sections with large local apertures roustaei et al 2016 analysed the so called fouling layers generated at the walls of smooth 2d channels during the flow of a yield stress fluid in which residual fluid is held stationary this geometric effect had also been observed in various experimental and computational analytical studies e g mitsoulis and huilgol 2004 de souza mendes et al 2007 chevalier et al 2013 roustaei and frigaard 2013 moreover frigaard and ryan 2004 analytically showed that in a conduit with regularly and smoothly varying aperture an intact and continuous plug exists throughout the channel however as the roughness of the walls increases the plug breaks creating three distinct regions the shear flow near the walls the stagnant zones forming a group of unconnected blobs and the regions of extensional flow between the islands of unyielded material based on the preceding observations roustaei et al 2016 suggested that the size of the flowing region without including the fouling layer in which the fluid remains stagnant governs pressure losses during the flow of a yield stress fluid rather than the aperture of the fracture nevertheless as stated by lavrov 2013a little is known about the features of the flow field for a yield stress fluid flowing in a realistic rough walled fracture in the present work the aperture variation over a given fracture was considered to be smooth when the minimum to maximum aperture ratio was higher than 0 4 arbitrary value in an attempt to elucidate the unyielding behaviour of a yield stress fluid in a realistic 2d fracture with smooth aperture variation the viscosity maps obtained at low pressure gradients were computed from an additional set of numerical experiment performed in the fracture with hn 608 µm minimum to maximum aperture ratio of 0 43 these experiments were performed following the procedure described in section 3 the results are presented in fig 6 confirming the existence of unconnected blobs of unyielded material inside the rough fracture with smoothly changing aperture also the thickness of the fouling layer generated in the vicinity of the walls decreases when the applied pressure gradient is increased 5 2 numerical results h eq calculation four sets of qi pi data were computed for the flow through the 2d channels of variable aperture by using the procedure presented in subsection 3 1 and the results are displayed in table 3 as explained in subsection 3 2 the aperture heq of an equivalent fracture with parallel smooth walls exhibiting the same flow rate under a given applied pressure gradient as the real rough walled flow channel was calculated for the geometries presented in fig 2 this was achieved by solving eq 8 with the computed qi pi data as input the variation of the calculated heq values when varying qi was shown to be negligible within the investigated range of flow rates the computed values of heq are listed in table 4 together with the corresponding values of the newtonian hydraulic aperture hn more details for the calculation of heq are provided as supplementary material figure s1 from table 4 it can be deduced that heq is very close to hn in all the investigated realistic rough walled 2d flow channels these results are consistent with the numerical modelling of shear thinning flows through rough walled fractures performed by di federico 1997 and lavrov 2013 in particular di federico 1997 showed that for the flow perpendicular to aperture variation heq is only slightly higher than hn for shear thinning fluids n 1 this was also the case of realistic aperture distributions in which the aperture varies both in parallel and perpendicular directions to fluid flow as the ones investigated in the laboratory experiments as a consequence of these observations the wi hi data computed with ysm from the experimental qi pi data by assuming the bundle of parallel rectangular flow channels presented in subsection 2 1 are expected to be close to the distribution of newtonian hydraulic apertures of the different flow channels 5 3 experimental results p vs q measurements the results of the pressure drop vs flow rate measurements provided by the ysm laboratory experiments presented in section 4 are displayed in fig 7 it should be noted that the average velocity u q hn w is represented in the horizontal axis of this figure instead of the flow rate in order to facilitate comparison between the two fractures careful observation of the experimental data shows that higher pressure gradients are generated in the vosges sandstone fracture as compared to the granite fracture for a given value of average velocity in the region u 10 4 m s this is consistent with the lower newtonian hydraulic aperture value of the vosges sandstone reported in table 2 however the measured pressure drops are slightly higher in the granite fracture for the lowest average velocities which can be explained by the influence of ad in this region in which only the channels with the highest aperture are conducting moreover as described by rodríguez de castro et al 2019 the overall flow is a power law of p with an exponent of 1 nrate for p 2 τ 0 h 0 where h0 is the aperture of the narrowest flow channel in the fracture when all flow channels are conducting at high pressure gradients according to the preceding remark fig 7 shows that all the flow channels are conducting at the highest flow rates imposed during the present experiments for both fractures it should be noted that porous media and rough walled rock fractures share the same characteristics in many features in this regard fig 7 suggests porous media type scaling displaying the three distinct flow regimes previously reported bauer et al 2019 1 a power law regime at the lowest flow rates within which the yield stress fluid only flows through the high conductance channels 2 an intermediate region in which the yield stress fluid progressively yields in more and more channels as the flow rate is increased and 3 a power law of p with an exponent of 1 n at the highest flow rates with the yield stress fluid flowing through all channels bauer et al 2019 performed lattice boltzmann numerical experiments in 3d porous media and laboratory experiments showing that the microstructural disorder of sphere packs and sandstones led to this type of porous media scaling also chaparian and tammisola 2020 conducted numerical experiments to analyze the hydrodynamic features of yield stress fluids flowing through 2d porous media under no slip and sliding conditions reporting the same type of porous media scaling in their q vs p datasets 5 4 experimental results obtained aperture distributions the experimental data presented in fig 7 were used as input to the ysm algorithm which allowed the determination of the had of both rough walled fractures as displayed in fig 8 it should be noted that the probability distributions represented in fig 8 are discrete therefore the relative frequencies of the different aperture classes can be directly obtained from the vertical coordinate value without calculating the surface area under the curve as in the case of a continuous distribution the lines joining the symbols represented in the figure are only provided in order to facilitate the reading of the graph moreover the flow curves predicted by the model used in ysm and presented in subsection 2 2 are provided as supplementary material figure s2 the computed peaks of probability were 498 µm for the vosges sandstone fracture and 914 µm for the granite fracture therefore as shown in fig 8 the mode of the inferred had is nearly equal to the newtonian hydraulic aperture for both fractures however this conclusion cannot be generalized to all porous medium yield stress fluid combinations and differences can be observed in porous media with different microstructural characteristics this aspect was addressed in a previous work rodríguez de castro et al 2016 showing that the mode of the pore size distribution provided by ysm and the hydraulic radius of a set of consolidated porous media did not always coincide in the same manner the present conclusions cannot be generalized to other rough walled rock fractures without further investigation also the averages of the hads provided by ysm were 538 µm for the vosges sandstone fracture and 953 µm for the granite fracture these values are close to the newtonian hydraulic aperture in both cases table 2 which is consistent with the numerical results presented in subsection 5 1 from fig 8 it can also be observed that the hads provided by ysm are quite narrow given that ysm provides the hydraulic apertures of the flow channels a narrow had can be interpreted as a quasi monodisperse size distribution of the flow channels constrictions to go further the results provided by ysm were also compared in fig 8 to the aperture distributions ads computed from the image processing procedure performed by nowamooz et al 2013 the locations of the bins represented in fig 8 correspond to the raw aperture classes defined by eq 5 for the ysm experiments under consideration it should be noted that the density of measurements in the work of nowamooz et al 2013 was higher than in the work of rodríguez de castro and radilla 2017 to which ysm method was applied therefore all the original aperture classes of nowamooz et al 2013 falling within the range a single bin of the ysm aperture distribution were merged to allow comparison independently of ysm results a first interesting observation is the evident similarity between the ads provided by the image processing method for both fractures indeed the average apertures obtained with this method hm in table 2 were 847 µm and 900 µm for the vosges sandstone fracture and the granite fracture respectively moreover the range of aperture classes with significant probability is also very close in both fractures from 500 µm to 1500 µm therefore the image processing method based on the measurement of light intensity through the attenuation law of beer lambert does not directly provide the distribution of hydraulic apertures a substantial difference between the results of both methods lies in the dispersion of the computed ads image processing and hads ysm indeed the ads provided by image processing are more disperse which was expected given that this method maps the whole fracture without any influence of the paths taken by the fluid during injection however in the case of the ysm method the measured quantity is the macroscopic pressure drop given that the aperture of the flow path evolves throughout the length of a flow channel ysm measurements are dominated by the apertures generating the lowest conductance i e the constrictions as shown in a preceding work rodríguez de castro et al 2019 consequently the frequencies of the greater aperture dimensions connected in series with the constrictions throughout the flow path will be absorbed by the presence of a low conductance zone resulting in narrower aperture distributions for ysm the contributions to the overall flow rate of a set of four different aperture classes determined by ysm in the case of the vosges sandstone fracture are provided as supplementary material figure s3 as a consequence of the preceding observations the had provided by ysm method are validated based on the following results 1 the newtonian hydraulic aperture of each fracture hn is close to the average of the had provided by ysm for both fractures 2 the hads obtained by ysm fall within the range of geometric apertures obtained by nowamooz for both fractures 3 the relationships between q and p are properly represented by the sum of the individual flows through a set of elementary rectangular channels of hydraulic aperture hi as can be observed in figure s3 of the supplementary material which is consistent with the model presented in subsection 2 1 4 the sum of the widths of the individual channels characterized by ysm i 1 z w i is almost identical to the total width w of the fracture difference lower than 3 in both cases 6 summary and conclusion the non toxic yield stress porosimetry method has been extended to the characterization of the hydraulic aperture distribution of rough walled rock fractures by adapting the model used to describe the pore space and also the inversion procedure then several 2d direct numerical simulations have been performed in order to interpret the physical meaning of the characterized aperture dimension moreover a set of experimental data has been used to obtain the hads of two replicas of real rough walled rock fractures by using ysm and the results have been compared to the ads provided by an image processing technique the main conclusions can be summarized as follows the hads of the real fracture replica were successfully obtained by applying the extended version of ysm the probability peaks of the hads obtained by ysm are very close to the hydraulic apertures for newtonian flow the whole range of computed aperture sizes falls within the bounds of the ads determined by an image processing method the image processing method does not directly capture the differences in terms of hydraulic aperture between the investigated rough walled rock fractures therefore this method cannot be directly used to accurately predict the relationships between pressure gradient and injection flow rate neither for newtonian fluid neither for non newtonian fluids furthermore the results of the numerical experiments revealed that the hads computed with ysm from the experimental qi pi data are close to the distribution of newtonian hydraulic apertures of the different flow channels the plug of stagnant fluid located in the central part of the flow channels breaks close to the constrictions forming islands of unyielded fluid the fluid remains unyielded in the corners of the sections with large apertures and the thickness of the fouling layer decreases as the applied pressure gradient is increased the implications of these findings are that ysm can be considered as a potential alternative to the existing methods for had characterization the main advantages are the simplicity of the tests the fact that the investigated fracture is not destroyed and the possibility of determining an had closely related to flow characteristics moreover the usefulness of ysm in characterizing dislocated media and fractured porous media presenting preferential flow paths has been demonstrated however despite the encouraging results discussed above further experiments are required in order to establish ysm as a reliable porosimetry method for rough walled fractures future studies could fruitfully explore this issue further by characterizing a set of fractures displaying a wide range of hads given that the present study was conducted using the only available experimental dataset in the literature future works will also provide an opportunity to optimize the experimental procedures of the ysm tests which should allow for obtaining hads with more bins in the vicinity of the probability peaks also the development of an efficient manner to produce fracture samples or replicas that can be used in ysm is desirable for future works declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper supplementary materials supplementary material

392,fractures in geological formations constitute high conductivity conduits which potentially act as preferential paths during fluid injection in soil remediation and reservoir engineering operations recently the measurement of the pressure drop under different flow rates during the flow of yield stress fluids in porous media has been proposed as the basis for an environmentally friendly method to characterize the pore size distribution however the yield stress fluids porosimetry method ysm has still not been extended to the characterization of the hydraulic aperture distribution of rough walled rock fractures the potential interest of such an extension is intense considering that the distinct characteristics of rock fractures vs the matrix represent a burden to other traditional porosimetry techniques in the particular case of x ray microtomography time consuming calibration is often needed and serious difficulties arise due to beam hardening and reconstruction artifacts the specific objective of the present investigation is to adapt ysm to the characterization of rough walled rock fractures for this purpose the results of laboratory experiments in which a yield stress fluid was injected through two natural rock fractures were exploited and the ysm model and algorithm was adapted to the particular topological and geometrical features of flows in fractures moreover numerical experiments were performed at the scale of a single 2d channel with variable aperture to identify the dimension characterized by ysm and decipher the yielding behaviour of the fluids the present findings show that ysm can be successfully used to characterize the distribution of hydraulic apertures of the flow channels in rough walled rock fractures furthermore the numerical results revealed that the plug of stagnant fluid is located in the central part of these flow channels and breaks close to the constrictions forming islands of unyielded fluid 1 introduction flow through fractured porous media plays a major role in various fields of geosciences including reservoir exploitation for water supply transport of contaminants from subsurface repositories geological isolation of nuclear waste underground storage of co2 mineralization processes mining petroleum engineering and geothermal systems berkowitz 2002 berre et al 2019 javadi et al 2010 given that the permeability of the fracture is orders of magnitude higher than that of the rock in which it is formed the fracture acts as a high conductivity conduit from the surrounding reservoir towards the producing well in enhanced oil recovery among other applications this raises a central issue in the specific case of soil remediation operations in which the displacing liquid may bypass the contaminated matrix if a natural fracture network is hit during injection lavrov 2013a a great number of yield stress fluids are commonly used as both displacing fluids to enhance mobility ratio and blocking agents to divert flow from highly permeable regions e g polymer solutions slurries foams and microemulsion kovscek and bertin 2003 silva et al 2012 di cristo et al 2019 forey et al 2020 omirbekov et al 2020 consequently it is of crucial importance to understand the flow behaviour of yield stress fluids as they enter fractures that are rough walled by nature on this subject frigaard et al 2017 reviewed the extensive use of yield stress fluids in oil and gas industry including the flow through fractured media as reviewed by birdsell et al 2015 hydraulic fracturing is a source of environmental concern due among other issues to the potential upward migration of the fracturing fluids to shallow drinking water aquifers through permeable pathways such as existing fractures such fracturing fluids often exhibit a yield stress therefore generating extra motivation for investigating the flow of yield stress fluids in fractured media fracture wall surfaces are rough and do not perfectly match generating voids of different sizes and spatial heterogeneity of the flow field auradou et al 2006 for this reason the accurate evaluation of fracture hydro mechanical properties relies heavily on the knowledge of the aperture distribution ad i e the distribution of perpendicular distances between asperities on adjacent fracture surfaces which serve as fluid flow paths dang et al 2019 li et al 2020 by analogy with a homogeneous porous medium the ad of the fracture can be considered as being its pore size distribution psd as the flow channels of varying aperture can be assimilated to individual pores huo et al 2016 listed 10 methods for measuring fracture apertures together with their main advantages and drawbacks as presented in table 1 among these methods the popular non destructive computed tomography method presents the serious shortcoming of needing calibration johns et al 1993 weerakone and wong 2010 lai et al 2017 in its conventional version which is a time consuming task and generally difficult to achieve on fracture networks voorn et al 2015 moreover the use of x ray micro computed tomography tests to characterize the psd of fractured media is challenging given the disparity between the dimensions of the fracture apertures and the size of the pores in the rock li et al 2017 indeed different requirements in terms of spatial resolution need to be met for the fracture and the host rock also the thin samples that are used in x ray micro computed tomography may not be representative of the heterogeneity of fractured media a great number of previous works exist dealing with the application of x ray to characterize the microstructure of porous media and the details on the advantages and limitations of this technique can be consulted in the literature lindquist and venkatarangan 2000 burlion et al 2006 prodanovic et al 2006 karpyn et al 2007 wildenschild and sheppard 2012 bultreys et al 2016 li et al 2017 houston et al 2017 tembely et al 2019 regarding the methods for fracture aperture characterization based on surface topography measurements resin injection and casting techniques hakami et al 1995 presented a review in which the advantages and shortcomings of each method were critically discussed as explained by these authors the preceding methods are intended for research purposes as in field mapping for site characterisation the measurements must be quicker and simpler the injection of yield stress fluids in porous media was first proposed as a potential method for porosimetry by ambari et al 1990 in that work it was shown that the psd of porous media can be derived from the measurement of flow rate q vs pressure gradient p during injection of a yield stress fluid through a sample of the investigated material the medium was modelled as an equivalent bundle of straight cylindrical capillaries of circular cross section with different radii providing the same flow rate vs pressure gradient relationship as the actual sample although the method was first proposed only for bingham fluids it was extended to casson and herschel bulkley fluids in subsequent works oukhlef 2011 oukhlef et al 2014 moreover oukhlef et al 2014 performed a set of numerical experiments with yield stress fluids in which the psds of bundles of capillaries were successfully computed from the analytical inversion of the generated q vs p datasets some major drawbacks of such inversion procedure were its deep sensitivity to experimental uncertainty and the noisy results obtained in the small pore size region in an attempt to solve these issues malvault 2013 proposed a procedure to achieve numerical inversion of q vs p data obtained from laboratory experiments nevertheless the accuracy of the results was highly dependent on the choice of the order of the polynomial fitting required to invert the experimental data the preceding contributions and theoretical concepts constituted the starting point for the development of the yield stress porosimetry method ysm which was presented by rodríguez de castro et al 2014 as a clean alternative to toxic mercury intrusion porosimetry león y león 1998 giesche 2006 cieszko et al 2019 the inversion algorithm followed in ysm uses the raw experimental data as input without any filtering or interpolation this was accomplished by identifying the contribution in terms of flow rate occurring only in the pores of decreasing size in which the fluid yields when the pressure gradient is steeply increased then from this new contribution the number of pores of the incorporated pore size class can be determined ysm was successfully applied to characterize the psds of both synthetic and natural consolidated porous media rodríguez de castro et al 2016 2018 more recently rodríguez de castro et al 2019 characterized the psds of unconsolidated packs of spherical beads by using ysm the preceding work showed that the results of ysm were essentially identical to those provided by mercury intrusion porosimetry also the comparison of ysm results with pore network models proved that the pore dimension being characterized by ysm is closer to the pore constriction rather than the pore body however rough walled fractures constitute a distinct type of pores given that the distance between the walls of the fracture i e the aperture is much lower than the width and the length of the fracture moreover in many fractures both walls come into contact zero aperture only at a limited number of points consequently the interstices are composed of a set of wide pores with varying aperture in between the contact points rather than being a network of interconnected smaller pores as is the case in common porous media such as rocks or sand packs for this reason the bundle of cylindrical capillaries model used when applying ysm to traditional porous media needs to be adapted to the geometrical and topological particularities of fractures the previous contributions to the development of a method to characterize the pore size distributions of porous media through the injection of complex fluids are summarized in the supplementary material of the present article table s1 until now ysm has only been applied to isotropic porous media the objective of the present investigation is to extend the use of ysm to the characterization of rough walled rock fractures in terms of their hydraulic aperture distribution had in order to fulfil this objective a model is first proposed to provide a suitable representation of the flow of yield stress fluids through this particular porous structure then a set of previously published experiments in which a yield stress fluid is injected through two replicas of real rock fractures are used as input to ysm algorithm in order to obtain the had additionally several 2d numerical simulations are performed to gain further insight into the characteristic aperture controlling the generation of pressure losses and therefore the ysm measurements in fractures the conclusions of the current study are critically discussed allowing the evaluation of ysm as an efficient method to characterize rough walled rock fractures 2 application of yield stress fluids porosimetry method to rough walled rock fractures in this section the porous medium model and the fluid rheology considered in the extension of ysm method to rough walled rock fractures are presented together with the underlying assumptions and the algorithm used to extract the had 2 1 modelling the flow of yield stress fluids through rough fractures the steady state shear rheology of the yield stress fluids used in the ysm method is described by herschel bulkley s law eq 1 under the assumption of simple shear conditions 1 τ τ 0 k γ n for τ τ 0 γ 0 for τ τ 0 in this model τ0 is the yield stress k is the consistency and n is the power law index of the fluid these rheological parameters are determined by fitting τ vs γ data obtained with a controlled stress rheometer neuzil and tracy 1981 tsang and tsang 1987 and silliman 1989 proposed simplified fracture models with 1 d aperture variability in which the total newtonian flow through a rough walled fracture is considered to be the sum of a set of elementary flows through plate channels of different apertures this type of model was subsequently extended to power law fluid flows di federico 1998 and more recently to the flow of truncated power law fluids felisa et al 2018 using a similar approach auradou et al 2006 presented a simple model in which the aperture field is replaced by a set of parallel channels each of constant aperture and perpendicular to the direction of shear displacement in shear displaced fractures exhibiting self affine geometries in the preceding work the authors showed that for a mean flow parallel to these channels the fluid streamlines are only weakly tortuous and the variations in their velocity along these flow paths are small compared to the velocity contrasts from one channel to another for each channel the velocity of the fluid was related to the pressure gradient by darcy s equation in a subsequent work auradou et al 2008 the width and geometry of the front of a dyed shear thinning polymer solution displacing a transparent solution of the same composition were studied as a function of the fluid rheology and flow rate observing low transverse mixing between the flow paths and showing hence that the fracture could be considered as a set of parallel ducts of constant hydraulic apertures also their results showed that the flow velocity contrasts between different flow channels was more significant for shear thinning fluids than for newtonian fluids the newtonian hydraulic aperture of a rough walled fracture hn is defined as the aperture of a hele shaw cell producing the same pressure loss as the actual rough walled fracture under any flow rate for the injection of a newtonian fluid therefore in the model used in the current work the void space between the walls of a rough fracture is discretized in a bundle of z straight parallel flow channels with rectangular cross section of widths wi and apertures hi with i ranging from 1 to z a schematic representation of this model is provided in fig 1 the transverse flow between channels may be considered as negligible auradou et al 2008 therefore one dimensional flow is considered within each flow channel the wall effects are neglected over the width direction and slipping condition is assumed between neighbour flow channels as displayed in fig 1 c in this regard lavrov 2013b numerically showed that a strong channelization of the flow occurs during the injection of shear thinning fluids through rough walled fractures this means that the flow rate contribution in the direction of the applied pressure gradient is much larger than the flow rate contribution perpendicular to the global direction of the flow as a consequence of the very high effective viscosity values exhibited by this type of fluids at small pressure gradients it is to be noted that such a simple model is not expected to represent the actual geometry and topology but only the characteristic dimensions determining the pressure losses through the real rock fracture therefore the total flow rate q through the fracture can be written as 2 q p i 1 z w i q p h i where p δp l is the absolute value of the pressure gradient δp is the absolute value of the pressure drop between the inlet and the outlet of the fracture l is the length of the straight channels hi are the different representative flow channel aperture classes and wi is the width of each flow channel in the preceding equation the wi hi data correspond to the flow channel hydraulic aperture distribution had of the investigated rough walled fracture and q p hi is the individual flow rate per unit width in a rectangular channel of aperture hi under a pressure gradient p in the case of creeping one dimensional flow of a newtonian fluid of shear viscosity μ q δp hi is given by hele shaw s equation 3 q p h i h i 3 12 μ p t with t being the hydraulic tortuosity and p being the magnitude of the pressure gradient in the flow direction based on the results of previous experiments shojaei et al 2019 which reported low tortuosity of the streamlines during the flow of yield stress fluids in a typical rock fracture the rectangular flow channels were considered to be perfectly straight in the present model t 1 whereas hi is known to be equal to the hydraulic aperture for newtonian fluids this equivalency is still to be proved in the case of yield stress fluids proving such equivalency will be the scope of the numerical simulations presented in section 3 of the present manuscript for a herschel bulkley fluid the q p hi relationships are given by skelland 1967 chhabra and richardson 2008 ferrás et al 2012 4 q p h i 2 n n 1 p k 1 n h i h 2 h i 2 h 0 2 1 1 n n h i 2 h 0 2 2 1 n 1 2 n 0 for h i h 0 for h i h 0 with h0 2τ0 p being the threshold aperture which represent the aperture of a flow channel below which no flow occurs under the considered pressure gradient obviously for τ0 0 n 1 and k µ eq 4 becomes identical to eq 3 2 2 computation of aperture distribution by using ysm the details of the algorithm used to compute the psd of a porous sample from the raw flow rate vs pressure gradient data qi pi collected during injection of a yield stress fluid were provided by rodríguez de castro et al 2014 2016 2018 hence only the essential features of the method and the procedure used to extend ysm to the case of rough walled fractures are presented in this section in order to characterize the hydraulic aperture distribution of a rough walled rock fracture with ysm an experiment must be performed that allows the collection of a set of qi pi data with qi being the total flow rate through the fracture these steady state measurements are performed during the injection of a herschel bulkley fluid through the investigated fracture the number of collected data couples is z 1 i 1 z 1 from the z 1 measurements a set of z representative flow channel apertures are defined as 5 h j α 2 τ 0 p j j 1 z it must be taken into account that flow under a given pressure gradient pj only occurs in channels with an aperture strictly larger than 2 τ 0 p j consequently the value of the numerical factor α in eq 5 must be greater than unity a full description of the procedure followed to compute the value of α was presented in the literature rodríguez de castro et al 2014 and is adapted to the case of fractures in the present section with the objective of extending ysm method to rough walled rock fractures it is first assumed that the bundle of z straight parallel flow channels with rectangular cross sectional areas presented in subsection 2 1 is capable of accurately predicting the relationship between flow rate and generated pressure losses then the width wj of the flow channel with aperture hj is calculated as being the maximum positive value of wj for which the following condition is respected 6 q s g 1 j w g q p s h g for s j 1 where q ps hg is given by eq 4 the width w1 of the flow channel with the largest aperture h1 is first determined by solving the system of inequations 6 for s 2 then w2 was calculated for s 3 and then the width of the flow channels of smaller and smaller aperture are computed until wz the width of the flow channel with the smallest aperture is calculated at the end of this process a set of hj wj data is obtained from these results the relative frequency p hj of each flow channel aperture class hj is given by 7 p h j h j w j i 1 z h i w i the suitable value of α named α is calculated as follows first α 1 is used to calculate the hj wj data and the total width of the flow channels i 1 z w i is computed then the same procedure is repeated by successively increasing the value of α with a scanning step of δ δ 0 1 was used in the present work until the hj wj data corresponding to α 2 has been calculated α is selected as being the value of α that minimizes the absolute value of the difference between the actual width of the fracture w and the calculated one i e w i 1 z w i from the computed hj wj data the calculated macroscopic relationship between the total flow rate through the fracture q and the pressure gradient p can be obtained using eq 2 it must be borne in mind that flow channels with large apertures contribute more significantly to the total flow rate hence the scanning procedure to calculate each wj should be more refined when the considered aperture is large for this reason the step used in the scanning procedure different from δ is defined as stepj ζq pz 1 hz q pz 1 hj where ζ is a coefficient that quantifies the refinement of scanning ζ 0 05 w was used in the considered experiments 3 numerical simulation of the flow of yield stress fluids through 2d rough walled rock fractures a set of 2d numerical simulations were performed in order to gain further insight into the physical meaning of the had provided by ysm in the case of rough walled rock fractures a key objective was to identify the regions of the fracture where most pressure drops were generated during the injection of yield stress fluids and their correlation with the hydraulic aperture as determined for newtonian fluids 3 1 investigated media karpyn et al 2007 conducted x ray microtomography experiments in order to map the internal structure of an artificially induced rough fracture in a berea sandstone which was oriented parallel to the natural bedding of the rock the results of such x ray microtomography experiments are freely available karpyn et al 2016 from the reconstructed fracture geometry the four segmented 2d slices displayed in fig 2 were used in the present work as an input to the numerical simulations moreover the bonej algorithm doube et al 2010 included in the open source image processing software imagej schindelin et al 2012 was used to determine the local aperture map of the 2d slices then a first set of newtonian direct numerical simulations was performed to determine the newtonian hydraulic aperture hn of these 2d slices the hn values are also given in fig 2 it can be seen that all the 2d slices present a wide range of local apertures and the value of hn is strongly affected by the presence of narrow constrictions as expected from the important pressure losses produced in these regions 3 2 the procedure for numerical experiments numerical simulations are commonly used to study the characteristics of flow systems whose mathematical models are too tedious to provide analytical solutions as it is the case of the flow of yield stress fluids through real rough walled fractures hewitt et al 2016 chaparian and tamiasola 2020 full 3d cfd simulations of this type of flows can become prohibitively expensive in terms of computational resources given that the two in plane dimensions of the fracture are much larger than the fracture aperture in order to avoid the computational cost of a fully 3d approach morris et al 2015 developed a simulator for the flow of power law bingham and herschel bulkley fluids through fractures by introducing a 2d aperture averaged analytic solution and compared the results to those obtained for a 3d model implemented in a commercial code these authors showed that the 2 d model was capable of predicting the location of the fluids in non mixing flows also for the first time zhang et al 2019 carried out 3d numerical simulations of the flow of shear thinning fluids without yield stress through a rough walled rock fracture by extracting the input geometry from a computed microtomography image recently rodríguez de castro and agnaou 2019 and rodríguez de castro et al 2020 performed numerical simulations that provided the velocity and viscosity maps for a herschel bulkley fluid flowing in a set of 2d porous media these media consisted of real and idealized packings of particles of various shapes and sizes following the procedure described in these previous works the finite element based numerical simulation software comsol multiphysics version 5 3 2017 was used in the present study to solve the flow problems under interest analogously to the work of bauer et al 2019 stokes flow was considered in the numerical simulations and the following equations were solved 0 π p with π being thethe deviatoric stress tensor and p being the pressure for a herschel bulkley fluid π can be written as follows π i j 2 μ δ i j where δ is the strain rate tensor i e δ i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i with u being the velocity vector and xi xj being the spatial coordinates a generalized shear rate γ can be defined by using einstein s summation convention γ 2 δ i j δ i j the following model was implemented to quantify the local viscosity of the yield stress fluid μ min μ max k γ n 1 τ 0 γ where μmax corresponds to a maximum viscosity the herschel bulkley shear rheology parameters of the investigated fluid were τ0 10 pa k 1 pa sn and n 0 5 a value μmax 10000 pa s was selected as a compromise between numerical stability and accuracy indeed using extremely high μmax values results in large viscosity gradients within the computational domain and instabilities on the other hand low μmax values fail to emulate a yield stress the chosen value of μmax corresponds to shear rates lower than γ 10 3s 1 further details on the viscosity regularisation methods for visco plastic fluid flow computation were provided in the literature frigaard and nouar 2005 the computational domain which is a 2d section of a fracture as shown in fig 2 was discretized using unstructured meshes composed of triangular element faces the elementary control volumes are defined around each node joining the centres of mesh elements the values obtained at mesh nodes are interpolated based on a linear lagrangian interpolation for the pressure whereas a quadratic interpolation is adopted for the velocity components the creeping flow module designed for solving stokes flows was used for each 2d geometry various inlet pressures were imposed as boundary conditions while keeping the outlet pressure equal to 0 and the corresponding steady state total flow rates per unit width m2 s were computed the non linear system of equations was solved using the comsol stationary solver the solution is sought by making use of a newton raphson algorithm that starts with the initial conditions as an initial guess the solution is considered converged upon reaching a residual below a relative tolerance of 10 3 within each newton raphson iteration the resulting system of linearized equations is solved using the direct solver pardiso schenk 2004 simulations are initiated with the fluid at rest to go further the influence of the chosen μmax value was also evaluated by comparing the results obtained by using the original μmax 10000 pa s value and a ten times greater μmax 100000 pa s value in the case of the 2d geometry with hydraulic aperture hn 372 µm and imposing an inlet pressure of 3000 pa the smallest one under consideration the observed differences in terms of both the average shear rate and the total flow rate per unit width used in ysm algorithm were negligible 1 20 and 2 2 respectively as reported by lavrov 2013a it is sometimes advantageous to replace a real rough walled fracture with an equivalent fracture with parallel smooth walls when incorporating fluid flow through fractures into higher level models such as reservoir simulators in this regard the equivalent aperture heq di federico 1997 1998 is defined as the aperture of a fracture with parallel smooth walls that would exhibit the same flow rate under a given applied pressure gradient as the real rough walled rock fracture in the case of newtonian flow heq hn for any considered pressure gradient tsang 1992 discussed the differences between the numerous definitions and notations of fracture apertures showing that the hydraulic aperture and the aperture obtained from tracer tests should not be assimilated in this respect tracer tests were performed by nowamooz et al 2013 in the same two fractures that will be investigated in the current work the distribution of local permeabilities were computed from the results of the tracer tests assuming a stratified medium model which required image processing stages and calibration regarding the determination of the hydraulic apertures of rock fractures borehole pumping tests were used by other authors for this purpose barton et al 1985 as listed in table 1 also cao et al 2016 stated that knowledge of the hydraulic aperture distribution had of a fracture is urgently needed in engineering construction and analytical models at the engineering field scale in the same work the authors presented a method for the measurement of had based on in situ camera measurements combined with borehole water pressure tests and discussed the relationships between hydraulic aperture and mechanical aperture from eq 4 the following expression can be written to calculate the equivalent apertures heq of the 2d considered flow channels from the numerically computed qj pj data for each imposed value of pj 8 q j p j h eq 2 n n 1 p j k 1 n h eq 2 h eq 2 h 0 2 1 1 n n h eq 2 h 0 2 2 1 n 1 2 n 0 for h eq h 0 for h eq h 0 eq 8 can be numerically solved to obtain heq for example this was achieved by using the differential evolution method in the present work it is noted that in contrast to the constant value of hn heq cannot be safely assumed to be constant for different values of pj in the case of yield stress fluids given the non linear relationship between flow rate and pressure gradient according to eq 2 the relationship wq p h n i 1 z w i q p h n i can be expressed as w h n 3 12 μ p t i 1 z w i h n i 3 12 μ p t for the injection of a newtonian fluid so w h n 3 i 1 z w i h n i 3 with w i 1 z w i and hn i being the newtonian hydraulic aperture of each flow channel given that yield stress fluids are used in ysm the question that arises is whether hn i is still representative of the characteristic aperture that should be used in the bundle model so as to accurately predict the relationship between flow rate and pressure loss in other words is i 1 z w i q p h n i still equivalent to the total flow rate wq p heq through a rough walled fracture for the injection of a herschel bulkley fluid to answer this question it will be first considered that each 2d fracture used in the present numerical experiments can be assimilated to an individual flow channel traversed by the yield stress fluid during its flow through a real fracture providing a representation of the evolving aperture of such flow channel throughout the medium then the equivalent aperture heq of a constant section flow channel providing the same pressure loss flow rate relationship as the actual 2d geometries presented in fig 2 for a wide range of flow rates will be computed from the results of the numerical experiments with herschel bulkley fluids finally the values of heq computed for the 2d geometries will be compared to the corresponding values of hn to assess the closeness of both quantities it should be highlighted that the objective of the current numerical simulations is not to assimilate the microscopic mechanisms arising during the flow of yield stress fluids through real 3d fractures to the mechanisms arising in a 2d geometry indeed significant differences exist between the 2d and the 3d cases in particular a preferential flow channel with higher flow rate than the one produced in the constrictions can be formed in 3d rough walled rock fractures in contrast the highest flow velocities are located in the constricted zones in the case of 2d channels as will be shown in subsection 5 1 4 experimental flow of yield stress fluids through rough walled rock fractures rodríguez de castro and radilla 2017 carried out flow rate vs pressure gradient measurements during the injection of a yield stress fluid through two well characterized rough walled rock fractures in this section the full experimental data set obtained by these authors is used as an input to the ysm algorithm to compute the had of both fractures 4 1 investigated media experimental works dealing with the injection of yield stress fluids in rough walled fractures are scarce rodríguez de castro and radilla 2017 shojaei et al 2019 rodríguez de castro and radilla 2017 conducted a set of laboratory experiments in which a concentrated polymer solution exhibiting a yield stress was injected through two transparent epoxy resin replicas of a granite fracture and a vosges sandstone fracture the details of the procedure followed for the fabrication of these fracture replicas are available elsewhere isakov et al 2001 nowamooz et al 2013 the width w total length permeability k newtonian hydraulic aperture hn and mechanical aperture arithmetic average hm of both fractures are listed in table 2 the aperture maps were previously obtained by nowamooz et al 2013 by means of an image processing procedure based on the attenuation of a light source following the law of beer lambert and are displayed in fig 3 for both fractures the smallest apertures are located in the central part and the largest apertures are located near the inlet and the outlet moreover the apertures of the vosges sandstone fracture are more variable at the lower half than at the upper half while the spatial variability appears to be relatively high across the entire granite fracture area as showed in the work of nowamooz et al 2013 the constrictions in the central part of these fractures constituted a barrier to fluid flow especially in the case of shear thinning and yield stress fluids as the pressure loss sensitivity to aperture is higher than for a newtonian one roustaei et al 2016 on this subject shojaei et al 2019 experimentally determined the velocity map of a yield stress fluid flowing through the same vosges sandstone fracture and characterized the apparent shear rheology of the fluid the characterization of the velocity map was achieved by performing a particle image velocimetry piv analysis on a set of images obtained during the flow of a pre generated foam exhibiting a yield stress through the transparent replica in order to monitor the position of the bubbles at different times the authors showed that the aperture variation strongly affects the apparent viscosity of the foam and the velocity contrast between preferential flow channels and stagnant zones 4 2 experimental setup and fluid properties the signature of had in the flow rate vs pressure gradient curve is only present at low flow rates for which the fluid remains unyielded in a fragment of the fracture i e in some of the flow channels depending on the applied pressure gradient given that this signature needs to be present in the q vs p data used as input to ysm algorithm the particularly wide range of flow rates 3 6 orders of magnitude imposed in the experiments of rodríguez de castro and radilla 2017 is suitable for its use in ysm algorithm the experimental setup and procedure presented in the following lines corresponds to the one used by these authors the calibration of the yield stress fluid was discussed in previous works rodríguez de castro et al 2018 xanthan gum aqueous solutions were selected due not only to their low degree of viscoelasticity and their negligible thixotropic behaviour but also to their environmentally friendly nature the herschel bulkley parameters of injected fluid were τ0 7 36 pa k 0 365 pa sn and n 0 52 the shear rheology of the xanthan solutions used in the present experiments was characterized by means of a stress controlled rheometer equipped with a cone plate geometry all rheological measurements were performed at 20 c by applying shear stresses linearly sampled from 0 to a maximum value producing a shear rate of approximately 1000 s 1 the τj γ j experimental data presented by rodríguez de castro and radilla 2017 were fitted to a herschel bulkley law by minimizing the sum j 1 n τ 0 k γ j n τ j 2 γ j with n being the number of τj γ j data by doing so the values of the yield stress τ0 the power law index n and the consistency k were determined the square of the difference between τj and τ 0 k γ j n was weighted by γ j following the procedure presented by rodríguez de castro et al 2014 moreover a set of effluent fluid samples were collected at the outlet of the fractures after injection at the highest flow rate the effluent rheograms were determined and compared to that of the inflowing fluid in order to assess polymer degradation retention of the polymer on the fracture walls and the constancy of the rheological parameters during all the experiments no significant difference was observed between the rheograms so polymer degradation and polymer retention were proved to be negligible the results also showed that the variation in the values of the herschel bulkley parameters over the set of experiments was not significant two different experimental setups were used depending on the injection flow rates for the low and moderate flow rates ranging from 1 67 10 8 to 1 67 10 6 m3 s an open injection circuit was used in which the aqueous polymer solution was injected through the fracture at a flow rate imposed by a dual piston pump for the highest flow rates ranging from 2 50 10 6 to 6 94 10 5 m3 s the circuit was closed in this second configuration a volumetric pump was used to inject the yield stress fluid from a tank situated upstream of the rough walled rock fracture and the fluid was continuously recirculated to the tank from the outlet of the fracture also a positive displacement flow meter was installed at the outlet of the volumetric pump to measure the injection flow rate in both configurations the pressure drop was measured with a differential pressure sensor over a distance of l 20 5 cm for the vosges sandstone fracture and l 27 cm for the granite fracture the range of the pressure sensor was adjusted by installing different membranes from 0 1400 pa to 0 56 000 pa with an accuracy of 0 3 of the full scale the range of the piston pump was from 1 67 10 9 to 1 67 10 6 m3 s with an accuracy of 2 while the range of the flow meter installed at the outlet of the volumetric pump was from 1 94 10 6 to 1 38 10 4 m3 s with an accuracy of 1 4 3 experimental procedure both rough walled fractures were saturated with co2 more water miscible gas than air prior to saturation with the yield stress fluid to avoid the formation of gas bubbles during the measurements then the fractures were fully saturated with the yield stress fluid which was subsequently injected at 45 different flow rates ranging from 1 67 10 9 to 4 72 10 5 m3 s through the granite fracture and at 38 flow rates that lie between 3 33 10 9 m3 s and 2 78 10 5 m3 s through the vosges sandstone fracture in each series the flow rate was steeply increased and the corresponding steady state pressure drop was measured each measurement was repeated four times and the uncertainty related to the repeatability was calculated as 2σ with σ being an estimate of the relative standard deviation of the measurements 95 confidence interval all experiments were performed at t 20 1 c it is highlighted that the minimum number of experiments required to obtain an hydraulic aperture distribution with an acceptable level of accuracy in ysm depends on the statistical dispersion of the microstructural dimensions of the characterized sample more dispersed samples require more measurements this statistical dispersion is unknown a priori unless some microstructural information is known beforehand this issue also arises in the case of other porosimetry methods such as mip and x ray microtomography techniques in particular the choice of minimum resolution in a microtomography measurement is often challenging nevertheless for the case of ysm experiments some general guidelines and recommendations can be made it should be ensured that the maximum flow rate imposed during the experiments qmax is adequate to make the yield stress fluid flow through all the channels of the rough walled fracture as explained in subsection 5 3 the preceding condition is respected if the fit of the data points at the highest flow rates leads to a power law of p with an exponent of 1 n the minimum flow rate imposed during the experiments qmin should be as low as possible and is given in practice by the technical limitations of the experimental setup however it must be checked that the value 2 τ 0 p min is close to the largest hydraulic aperture sizes expected in the characterized fracture rodríguez de castro 2014 tested different sampling procedures for ysm in order to evaluate their suitability based on the results reported in this previous work it is recommended that during each experiment a set of different flow rates qj j 1 z 1 should be imposed to the injected the yield stress fluid following the sequence below q j q min q max q min z 1 i z based on the previous experimental and numerical works listed in table s1 of the supplementary material in which ysm was used to characterize high and moderate permeability samples it is recommended that the number of experimental data z 1 should be greater than 30 however the accuracy of the obtained had is expected to be improved by increasing the number of measurements 5 results 5 1 numerical results velocity and viscosity maps some examples of the velocity maps obtained by performing the numerical simulations presented in subsection 3 2 are presented in fig 4 showing the existence of a wide range of velocities within a single 2d channel with much higher velocity values in the constrictions of the fracture and lower velocity values in the vicinity of the walls as expected it is highlighted that the extension of the high velocity regions warmer colours in fig 4 is greater for the 2d flow channels of greater hydraulic apertures mitsoulis and huilgol 2004 numerically investigated the flow of bingham fluids through conduits with an abrupt expansion their results showed that the plug region of unyielded fluid breaks at the location of the drastic aperture change resulting in the formation of blobs of unyielded material in the corners of the expansion the size of such blobs increases by decreasing the injection flow rates as bingham number increases de souza mendes et al 2007 also showed that unyielded regions appear first in the corners of an abrupt expansion whereas for the smooth geometries of roustaei and frigaard 2013 unyielded fluid was first observed in the deepest part of the channel i e with the highest aperture the viscosity maps computed from the numerical experiments performed in the 2d fracture with hn 372 µm are presented in fig 5 for different values of the imposed pressure drop this 2d fracture presents important aperture variations with a central constricted area fig 5 shows that the plug breaks close to the constriction in the low local aperture zones forming islands of unyielded fluid also the fluid remains unyielded in the corners of the sections with large local apertures roustaei et al 2016 analysed the so called fouling layers generated at the walls of smooth 2d channels during the flow of a yield stress fluid in which residual fluid is held stationary this geometric effect had also been observed in various experimental and computational analytical studies e g mitsoulis and huilgol 2004 de souza mendes et al 2007 chevalier et al 2013 roustaei and frigaard 2013 moreover frigaard and ryan 2004 analytically showed that in a conduit with regularly and smoothly varying aperture an intact and continuous plug exists throughout the channel however as the roughness of the walls increases the plug breaks creating three distinct regions the shear flow near the walls the stagnant zones forming a group of unconnected blobs and the regions of extensional flow between the islands of unyielded material based on the preceding observations roustaei et al 2016 suggested that the size of the flowing region without including the fouling layer in which the fluid remains stagnant governs pressure losses during the flow of a yield stress fluid rather than the aperture of the fracture nevertheless as stated by lavrov 2013a little is known about the features of the flow field for a yield stress fluid flowing in a realistic rough walled fracture in the present work the aperture variation over a given fracture was considered to be smooth when the minimum to maximum aperture ratio was higher than 0 4 arbitrary value in an attempt to elucidate the unyielding behaviour of a yield stress fluid in a realistic 2d fracture with smooth aperture variation the viscosity maps obtained at low pressure gradients were computed from an additional set of numerical experiment performed in the fracture with hn 608 µm minimum to maximum aperture ratio of 0 43 these experiments were performed following the procedure described in section 3 the results are presented in fig 6 confirming the existence of unconnected blobs of unyielded material inside the rough fracture with smoothly changing aperture also the thickness of the fouling layer generated in the vicinity of the walls decreases when the applied pressure gradient is increased 5 2 numerical results h eq calculation four sets of qi pi data were computed for the flow through the 2d channels of variable aperture by using the procedure presented in subsection 3 1 and the results are displayed in table 3 as explained in subsection 3 2 the aperture heq of an equivalent fracture with parallel smooth walls exhibiting the same flow rate under a given applied pressure gradient as the real rough walled flow channel was calculated for the geometries presented in fig 2 this was achieved by solving eq 8 with the computed qi pi data as input the variation of the calculated heq values when varying qi was shown to be negligible within the investigated range of flow rates the computed values of heq are listed in table 4 together with the corresponding values of the newtonian hydraulic aperture hn more details for the calculation of heq are provided as supplementary material figure s1 from table 4 it can be deduced that heq is very close to hn in all the investigated realistic rough walled 2d flow channels these results are consistent with the numerical modelling of shear thinning flows through rough walled fractures performed by di federico 1997 and lavrov 2013 in particular di federico 1997 showed that for the flow perpendicular to aperture variation heq is only slightly higher than hn for shear thinning fluids n 1 this was also the case of realistic aperture distributions in which the aperture varies both in parallel and perpendicular directions to fluid flow as the ones investigated in the laboratory experiments as a consequence of these observations the wi hi data computed with ysm from the experimental qi pi data by assuming the bundle of parallel rectangular flow channels presented in subsection 2 1 are expected to be close to the distribution of newtonian hydraulic apertures of the different flow channels 5 3 experimental results p vs q measurements the results of the pressure drop vs flow rate measurements provided by the ysm laboratory experiments presented in section 4 are displayed in fig 7 it should be noted that the average velocity u q hn w is represented in the horizontal axis of this figure instead of the flow rate in order to facilitate comparison between the two fractures careful observation of the experimental data shows that higher pressure gradients are generated in the vosges sandstone fracture as compared to the granite fracture for a given value of average velocity in the region u 10 4 m s this is consistent with the lower newtonian hydraulic aperture value of the vosges sandstone reported in table 2 however the measured pressure drops are slightly higher in the granite fracture for the lowest average velocities which can be explained by the influence of ad in this region in which only the channels with the highest aperture are conducting moreover as described by rodríguez de castro et al 2019 the overall flow is a power law of p with an exponent of 1 nrate for p 2 τ 0 h 0 where h0 is the aperture of the narrowest flow channel in the fracture when all flow channels are conducting at high pressure gradients according to the preceding remark fig 7 shows that all the flow channels are conducting at the highest flow rates imposed during the present experiments for both fractures it should be noted that porous media and rough walled rock fractures share the same characteristics in many features in this regard fig 7 suggests porous media type scaling displaying the three distinct flow regimes previously reported bauer et al 2019 1 a power law regime at the lowest flow rates within which the yield stress fluid only flows through the high conductance channels 2 an intermediate region in which the yield stress fluid progressively yields in more and more channels as the flow rate is increased and 3 a power law of p with an exponent of 1 n at the highest flow rates with the yield stress fluid flowing through all channels bauer et al 2019 performed lattice boltzmann numerical experiments in 3d porous media and laboratory experiments showing that the microstructural disorder of sphere packs and sandstones led to this type of porous media scaling also chaparian and tammisola 2020 conducted numerical experiments to analyze the hydrodynamic features of yield stress fluids flowing through 2d porous media under no slip and sliding conditions reporting the same type of porous media scaling in their q vs p datasets 5 4 experimental results obtained aperture distributions the experimental data presented in fig 7 were used as input to the ysm algorithm which allowed the determination of the had of both rough walled fractures as displayed in fig 8 it should be noted that the probability distributions represented in fig 8 are discrete therefore the relative frequencies of the different aperture classes can be directly obtained from the vertical coordinate value without calculating the surface area under the curve as in the case of a continuous distribution the lines joining the symbols represented in the figure are only provided in order to facilitate the reading of the graph moreover the flow curves predicted by the model used in ysm and presented in subsection 2 2 are provided as supplementary material figure s2 the computed peaks of probability were 498 µm for the vosges sandstone fracture and 914 µm for the granite fracture therefore as shown in fig 8 the mode of the inferred had is nearly equal to the newtonian hydraulic aperture for both fractures however this conclusion cannot be generalized to all porous medium yield stress fluid combinations and differences can be observed in porous media with different microstructural characteristics this aspect was addressed in a previous work rodríguez de castro et al 2016 showing that the mode of the pore size distribution provided by ysm and the hydraulic radius of a set of consolidated porous media did not always coincide in the same manner the present conclusions cannot be generalized to other rough walled rock fractures without further investigation also the averages of the hads provided by ysm were 538 µm for the vosges sandstone fracture and 953 µm for the granite fracture these values are close to the newtonian hydraulic aperture in both cases table 2 which is consistent with the numerical results presented in subsection 5 1 from fig 8 it can also be observed that the hads provided by ysm are quite narrow given that ysm provides the hydraulic apertures of the flow channels a narrow had can be interpreted as a quasi monodisperse size distribution of the flow channels constrictions to go further the results provided by ysm were also compared in fig 8 to the aperture distributions ads computed from the image processing procedure performed by nowamooz et al 2013 the locations of the bins represented in fig 8 correspond to the raw aperture classes defined by eq 5 for the ysm experiments under consideration it should be noted that the density of measurements in the work of nowamooz et al 2013 was higher than in the work of rodríguez de castro and radilla 2017 to which ysm method was applied therefore all the original aperture classes of nowamooz et al 2013 falling within the range a single bin of the ysm aperture distribution were merged to allow comparison independently of ysm results a first interesting observation is the evident similarity between the ads provided by the image processing method for both fractures indeed the average apertures obtained with this method hm in table 2 were 847 µm and 900 µm for the vosges sandstone fracture and the granite fracture respectively moreover the range of aperture classes with significant probability is also very close in both fractures from 500 µm to 1500 µm therefore the image processing method based on the measurement of light intensity through the attenuation law of beer lambert does not directly provide the distribution of hydraulic apertures a substantial difference between the results of both methods lies in the dispersion of the computed ads image processing and hads ysm indeed the ads provided by image processing are more disperse which was expected given that this method maps the whole fracture without any influence of the paths taken by the fluid during injection however in the case of the ysm method the measured quantity is the macroscopic pressure drop given that the aperture of the flow path evolves throughout the length of a flow channel ysm measurements are dominated by the apertures generating the lowest conductance i e the constrictions as shown in a preceding work rodríguez de castro et al 2019 consequently the frequencies of the greater aperture dimensions connected in series with the constrictions throughout the flow path will be absorbed by the presence of a low conductance zone resulting in narrower aperture distributions for ysm the contributions to the overall flow rate of a set of four different aperture classes determined by ysm in the case of the vosges sandstone fracture are provided as supplementary material figure s3 as a consequence of the preceding observations the had provided by ysm method are validated based on the following results 1 the newtonian hydraulic aperture of each fracture hn is close to the average of the had provided by ysm for both fractures 2 the hads obtained by ysm fall within the range of geometric apertures obtained by nowamooz for both fractures 3 the relationships between q and p are properly represented by the sum of the individual flows through a set of elementary rectangular channels of hydraulic aperture hi as can be observed in figure s3 of the supplementary material which is consistent with the model presented in subsection 2 1 4 the sum of the widths of the individual channels characterized by ysm i 1 z w i is almost identical to the total width w of the fracture difference lower than 3 in both cases 6 summary and conclusion the non toxic yield stress porosimetry method has been extended to the characterization of the hydraulic aperture distribution of rough walled rock fractures by adapting the model used to describe the pore space and also the inversion procedure then several 2d direct numerical simulations have been performed in order to interpret the physical meaning of the characterized aperture dimension moreover a set of experimental data has been used to obtain the hads of two replicas of real rough walled rock fractures by using ysm and the results have been compared to the ads provided by an image processing technique the main conclusions can be summarized as follows the hads of the real fracture replica were successfully obtained by applying the extended version of ysm the probability peaks of the hads obtained by ysm are very close to the hydraulic apertures for newtonian flow the whole range of computed aperture sizes falls within the bounds of the ads determined by an image processing method the image processing method does not directly capture the differences in terms of hydraulic aperture between the investigated rough walled rock fractures therefore this method cannot be directly used to accurately predict the relationships between pressure gradient and injection flow rate neither for newtonian fluid neither for non newtonian fluids furthermore the results of the numerical experiments revealed that the hads computed with ysm from the experimental qi pi data are close to the distribution of newtonian hydraulic apertures of the different flow channels the plug of stagnant fluid located in the central part of the flow channels breaks close to the constrictions forming islands of unyielded fluid the fluid remains unyielded in the corners of the sections with large apertures and the thickness of the fouling layer decreases as the applied pressure gradient is increased the implications of these findings are that ysm can be considered as a potential alternative to the existing methods for had characterization the main advantages are the simplicity of the tests the fact that the investigated fracture is not destroyed and the possibility of determining an had closely related to flow characteristics moreover the usefulness of ysm in characterizing dislocated media and fractured porous media presenting preferential flow paths has been demonstrated however despite the encouraging results discussed above further experiments are required in order to establish ysm as a reliable porosimetry method for rough walled fractures future studies could fruitfully explore this issue further by characterizing a set of fractures displaying a wide range of hads given that the present study was conducted using the only available experimental dataset in the literature future works will also provide an opportunity to optimize the experimental procedures of the ysm tests which should allow for obtaining hads with more bins in the vicinity of the probability peaks also the development of an efficient manner to produce fracture samples or replicas that can be used in ysm is desirable for future works declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

393,in this article we consider a two phase flow model in a highly heterogeneous porous column the porous column consists of homogeneous blocks where the porosity and permeability vary from one block to the other the flow direction is perpendicular to the layering of the porous column and hence can be approximated by one dimensional model equations the periodic change in porosity and absolute permeability enforce the fluid to be trapped at the interface between the blocks leading to a highly varying saturation in order to capture the effective behavior upscaled equations for the average saturation are derived via homogenization this technique relies on a notion of periodicity and allows averaging over any number of blocks that may have any internal distributions of the rock parameters moreover the present article also derives effective equations for randomly distributed layers of different porosity and absolute permeability numerical experiments are performed which show good agreement between the averaged solutions of the original micro scale equations and the solutions of the upscaled equations also in the case of randomly distributed layers in particular these numerical experiments show how the internal distribution of the permeability and porosity affect the effective behavior of the flow keywords homogenization upscaling heterogeneous medium two phase flow 1 introduction multi phase flow through highly heterogeneous porous medium is encountered in various natural systems for example co2 sequestration in subsurface flow oil natural gas transport inside petroleum reservoirs groundwater networks etc generally these natural systems are spatially heterogeneous and range from small scale to large scale formations a typical heterogeneity stems from the composition of two homogeneous materials separated by a sharp interface where this transition is non smooth understanding the effect of such a sharp interface on the movement of these phases is an important topic and has drawn the attention of the research community in the last few decades kueper et al 1989 experimentally studied the effect of the heterogeneities on two phase flow through porous structures van lingen 1998 carried out a laboratory experiment on a column of porous layers with periodically varying permeability it may be noted that in petroleum recovery process rock heterogeneities lead to counter productive results for example if the permeability of the reservoir formation is high from the injection well to the production well a large amount of oil is bypassed during the water drive due to the preferential flow paths this leads to a substantial reduction in the recovery rate on the other hand let us consider the case when the rock inhomogeneity is perpendicular or cross laminated to flow from the injection to the production well in this case during water drive oil phase trapping is encountered at the interface between high and low permeability regions and flow becomes stagnant this again causes reduction in the recovery rate fluid flow inside these cross laminated heterogenous structures are studied by kortekaas 1985 and by duijn et al 1995 in a similar framework dale et al 1997 studied a steady two phase flow in a heterogeneous medium a very common challenge in petroleum reservoir models is the effect of small scale heterogeneities which significantly impact the large scale behavior of flow through the reservoir formation specifically the reservoir characteristics like porosity intrinsic permeability relative permeability etc vary at a microscopic scale compared to the field scale in general these micro scale variations largely control the macro scale flow behavior in order to capture these micro scale variations one has to perform detailed simulations which are very expensive with respect to time and other resources hence one should look for upscaling these oscillatory quantities and obtain a macro model or an intermediate scale model that is more amenable to perform simulations thus it is necessary to derive effective equations and constitutive relationships which can further capture the influence of micro scale heterogeneities and effectively transfer them to the large scale modeling approach one may refer to wen and gómez hernández 1996 for a detailed overview of the upscaling techniques for absolute permeabilities in heterogeneous media a comparative investigation between various dynamic upscaling methods for two phase flow based on fluid potentials is presented in darman et al 2002 a wide range of literature is available on the upscaling of multi phase fluid flow through porous media volume averaging techniques and homogenization or two scale asymptotic expansion techniques are popular upscaling methods for multi phase flow through porous media whitaker 1986 used volume averaging techniques and developed a macroscopic model for stokes flow of two immiscible fluids through a medium consisting of a rigid solid skeleton whitaker 1994 and lasseux et al 1996 improved this process by transforming the closure problem to stokes like equations that can be solved to determine the permeability tensors later lasseux et al 2008 derived a macroscopic model through volume averaging techniques for inertial two phase fluid flow through homogeneous porous media in the context of two phase flow through heterogeneous permeable structures quintard and whitaker 1988 derived large scale transport equations using volume averaging they also developed a closure scheme which can theoretically determine the large scale permeability tensor along with the large scale capillary pressure quintard and whitaker 1990a used the method of volume averaging to capture the complexities of two phase flow in heterogeneous porous media and derived a macroscopic form of the momentum equations for two immiscible fluids along with the large scale permeability tensor and a dynamic large scale capillary pressure here the corresponding closure problem was expressed in terms of integro differential equations for each of the phases involving two permeability tensors continuing their work quintard and whitaker 1990b presented numerical experiments in a two region model of a stratified system based on local volume averaged equations and compared these with the theoretical results obtained from large scale averaging quintard and whitaker 1988 1990a in general volume averaging techniques provide the form of the upscaled equations but in order to determine the coefficients it must be supplemented with physical arguments and or associated data berryman 2005 through assuming periodicity explicit expressions for the coefficients in the upscaled equations can be obtained through homogenization one may refer davit et al 2013 for a comparative investigation between volume averaging with closure and formal periodic asymptotics based on multi scale expansions in this context a noteworthy upscaling method of considerable interest is the homogenization using two scale asymptotic expansion methods we refer to hornung 1997 cioranescu and donato 1999 and auriault et al 2009 for more details on the homogenization technique lewandowska et al 2004 and neuweiler and cirpka 2005 used a homogenization approach to derive upscaled quantities for unsaturated porous media flow mikelić 2000 presented a detailed note on homogenization theory and its application to infiltration through porous structures several researchers beliaev 2003 bourgeat and hidani 1995 yeh 2006 zijl and trykozko 2002 have relied on this homogenization approach and analyzed incompressible immiscible two phase flow through heterogeneous porous media through homogenization bourgeat and panfilov 1998 constructed a macro scale model for two phase flow in a dual porosity medium moreover they determined a capillary relaxation time the existing literature indicates that upscaled models have been exploited to address multi phase flow through layered porous media mouche et al 2010 developed such a model for the vertical migration of a co2 plume through a vertical column filled with a periodically layered porous medium since the configuration is vertical both capillarity and buoyancy are taken into account and semi explicit upscaled flux functions are proposed transport of immiscible compressible fluids such as water gas through porous media is discussed by amaziane et al 2010 there a weak formulation of a nonlinear parabolic equation for the non wetting phase pressure and a nonlinear degenerate parabolic diffusion convection equation for the wetting phase saturation is developed considering a rapidly oscillating porosity function and absolute permeability tensor a nonlinear homogenized problem is obtained it is noticed that a large variation in the porosities permeabilities and the capillary pressure curves significantly control the rate and extent of the oil trapping or the storage of supercritical co2 moreover analyzing the impact of block type heterogeneities on the oil trapping in the upscaling context is an important area of research in the field of petroleum extraction process accounting for the influence of the capillary and viscous forces virnovsky et al 2004 presented an upscaled model for steady state two phase flow in a heterogeneous medium with periodic structures they computed rate dependent relative permeabilities and effective capillary pressure for the above mentioned setup adopting two scale asymptotic expansion methods van duijn et al 2002 derived the effective flow equations for a layered media with flow orthogonal to the strata they also considered a medium consisting of multiple layers and with random properties hence upscaled equations are derived for periodically as well as randomly layered media where the random nature is treated as a stationary ergodic structure van duijn et al 2002 assumed continuity of the first order term in the asymptotic expansion of the oil saturation this has lead to enhanced diffusivity effect in the effective equations van duijn et al 2007 consequently assuming continuity of the first order terms in the asymptotic expansion of the capillary pressure van duijn et al 2007 derived the effective quantities which are the weighted harmonic mean of the micro scale properties and these are different from the ones derived by van duijn et al 2002 the differences in the effective quantities are mainly in terms of the weights in this article we adopt a similar approach as in van duijn et al 2007 schweizer 2008 presented a convergence proof of the homogenization procedure for the setting used in van duijn et al 2002 2007 more precisely schweizer 2008 proved the weak convergence of the multi scale saturation and flux towards their effective counterparts however without hinting to the explicit form only the structure of the effective quantities are provided for the upscaled models schweizer and pop 2007 have shown that the effective models derived in van duijn et al 2007 and schweizer 2008 are equivalent using the concept of weighted solutions henning et al 2013 derived a rigorous homogenization result for degenerate two phase flow in a porous medium szymkiewicz et al 2011 proposed a macroscopic model for two phase flow accounting the trapping effects in a heterogeneous porous medium composed of disconnected inclusions embedded in the background material later szymkiewicz et al 2012 extended the previous study of szymkiewicz et al 2011 with two specific objectives i pointing out the limitations of the richard s equation for porous media with disconnected coarse inclusions ii accounting for the effect of apparent air entry pressure due to heterogeneous structures deriving an upscaled form of the modified richard s equation in the context of unsaturated porous media flow szymkiewicz et al 2014 have shown that the performance of the richard s equation can be improved by introducing appropriately defined effective permeability and capillary pressure functions representing large scale behavior of the heterogeneous medium bertsch et al 2003 analyzed the existence uniqueness and the regularity properties along with the matching conditions at the interface between the two types of rock with different permeabilities a generic model for capillary entrapment together with the convergence study of a numerical scheme of industrial interest is presented by enchery et al 2006 using an appropriate regularization and time discretization buzzi et al 2009 showed the existence for degenerate two phase flow equations in one space dimension for a simplified model of two phase flow the influence of discontinuous capillary forces at the interfaces between several rock types is investigated by cances 2010 ahmadi et al 2010 relied on numerical simulations to analyze the generalized darcy forchheimer model for two phase flow in a heterogeneous porous medium ern et al 2010 presented a sequential discontinuous galerkin method to approximate the trapping effects for two phase flow through heterogeneous porous media with capillary pressure discontinuity recently van duijn et al 2016 studied a two phase flow in heterogeneous porous media with dynamic capillarity effects the medium that they considered was composed of two adjacent homogeneous blocks with a sharp interface and they consequently derived the coupling conditions at the sharp transition face it is noticed that in most of the existing literature heterogeneity is mainly due to different permeabilities in the adjacent layers only a few researchers have treated heterogeneities due to both porosity and absolute permeability moreover the majority of the available studies in upscaling deals with a single discontinuity in the unit cell models allowing multiple types of heterogeneities and hence averaging over several discontinuities in the unit cell expected to better describe the average behavior in a highly heterogeneous reservoir on a fairly coarse grid we address such models in the current work here in this paper we generalize the problem considered by van duijn et al 2002 2007 which deals with the trapping phenomena at the micro scale we adopt homogenization techniques and two scale asymptotic expansion methods to derive the effective equations and the corresponding constitutive relations we consider only the capillary limit case i e capillary number is of order one in the dimensionless form physically we are interested in a situation when the capillary effects due to surface tension are balanced with the viscous effects the present study can not be thought of just as a simple generalization of van duijn et al 2002 2007 as the current work derives effective equations in two different configurations i cell containing a single discontinuity and ii cell containing multiple discontinuities we allow porosity and intrinsic permeability to vary on the micro scale we demonstrate the convergence through numerical examples further this study considers a variety of orientations for distribution of the porosity and permeability layers in addition this article derives upscaled equations for randomly distributed layers of different porosity and absolute permeability this study also briefly presents upscaled quantities for any number of discontinuities within a unit cell although we consider upscaling of a one dimensional model understanding the complex behavior for this setting is important for extending to two or three dimensions which will be taken up in future in section 2 we present the mathematical model for two phase flow through heterogeneous porous media section 3 deals with the derivation of the upscaled equations for highly heterogeneous porous structures effective quantities for a single discontinuity within a cell can be found in section 3 2 and extended results for multiple discontinuities within a cell are shown in section 3 3 section 4 deals with the derivation of effective equations for randomly distributed blocks a brief discussion on the numerical discretization of the micro scale and the upscaled equations are in section 5 1 and 5 2 respectively various numerical test cases are presented in section 5 3 with the final remarks in section 6 we conclude this article 2 mathematical formulation this section deals with the mathematical formulation of a specific two phase flow model the model is defined on a highly heterogeneous porous structure the highly heterogeneous porous medium consists of homogeneous layers with different porosity and absolute permeability these layers are perpendicular to the flow direction leading to a one dimensional flow and a medium with different coarse and fine layers refer fig 1 here we assume that the porosity ϕ x as well as absolute intrinsic permeability k x are varying between the layers note that the porosity and intrinsic permeability are assumed to be constant inside each layer hence here we analyze the one dimensional flow of two incompressible and immiscible phases through a medium with homogeneous layers of any porosity and intrinsic permeability zones throughout this investigation water is being considered as the wetting fluid and oil as the non wetting fluid the governing equations are the mass conservation 2 1 ϕ x s α t q α x 0 with α w n w and the multi phase extended darcy law with x axis along the flow direction 2 2 q α k x k r α s α μ α p α x the system is closed with the constraints on phase saturation and capillary pressure as 2 3 s w s n w 1 2 4 p n w p w p c x s w here ϕ k s μ kr p and q denote the porosity the intrinsic absolute permeability the saturation mapped to the standard interval 0 1 the viscosity the relative permeability the phase pressure and the specific discharge respectively with subscripts for each of the phases the capillary pressure is described by the widely used leverett model leverett 1941 2 5 p c x s w σ ϕ x k x j s w where σ and j are respectively the interfacial tension between the two fluids and the leverett function it is assumed that j is strictly decreasing going to infinity as sw 0 and that j 1 0 physically this indicates that the pressure difference in the two phases should exceed the capillary entry pressure given by p c x 1 σ ϕ x k x j 1 before the oil phase can penetrate into a fully water saturated core it may be noted that the entry pressure is inversely proportional to the square root of the absolute permeability and directly related to the square root of porosity and therefore varies between the layers thus the entry pressure will be discontinuous at the interface separating the two layers the mass conservation eq 2 1 together with the saturation constraint 2 3 implies that the total specific discharge darcy s velocity q q w q n w is constant in space i e q x 0 for the sake of simplicity we assume that the total specific discharge is constant with time as well hence one can choose q 0 as a prescribed quantity i e the flow takes place from left to right following van duijn et al 2002 2007 we set u s n w and consequently s w 1 u this eventually prompts us to redefine the functional form of k r α with α w n w pc and j in terms of u now j becomes strictly increasing with u and approaches to infinity as u 1 and j 0 0 taking into account the constant nature of the total darcy velocity specific discharge one can combine eqs 2 1 2 2 and conditions 2 3 2 4 into a single transport equation for the oil saturation consequently the saturation equation for the oil phase in terms of the new variable u can be written as 2 6 ϕ x u t x k r n w k r n w m k r w q k x μ w k r n w k r w k r n w m k r w p c x 0 note that in the leverett model of capillary pressure eq 2 5 an explicit relation between the capillary pressure porosity and absolute permeability of the medium is prescribed this expresses the saturation eq 2 6 precisely in terms of these discontinuous quantities of interest i e porosity and absolute permeability which in turn enable us to effectively capture the impact of these quantities in the formal derivation of the effective equations introducing the non dimensional variables as 2 7 x x l t t q l k k k where l is a macroscopic characteristic length scale and k is the characteristic absolute permeability for notational convenience we drop the hats in the rest of this study in this way we bring eq 2 6 to a dimensionless form as 2 8 ϕ x u t f x 0 with 2 9 f f u n c k x k r w u f u x p c x u here 2 10 f u k r n w k r n w m k r w is the fractional flow function and 2 11 p c x u ϕ x k x j u is the dimensionless capillary pressure the capillary number nc and the viscosity ratio m are defined as follows 2 12 n c σ k μ w q l m μ o μ w one must note that based on the specific application the value of the capillary number nc may vary considerably the jumps in the porosity ϕ and intrinsic permeability k produce discontinuities in the capillary pressure hence across the interfaces the spatial derivatives in eqs 2 8 and 2 9 need a special attention to deal with this complexity duijn et al 1995 bertsch et al 2003 have suggested to consider eq 2 8 only in the homogeneous layers with constant ϕ and k and to enforce matching conditions across the discontinuities specifically we assume that the discontinuity interface is located at x x i for given ϕ and k the matching conditions read for all t 0 2 13 f t x i 0 2 14 u x i t p c t x i 0 p c t x i 0 where f t x i f x i t f x i t is the jump in the flux at the interface xi and p c t x i likewise condition 2 13 expresses the flux continuity from condition 2 14 the capillary pressure is continuous p c t x i 0 only if the oil phase is present on the both sides of the interface u x i t 0 on the other hand the capillary pressure is discontinuous across the interface p c t x i 0 if the oil phase disappears for x xi i e u x i t 0 to complete the model suitable initial and boundary conditions are also needed as the upscaling procedure is independent of these they will be specified in section 5 it may be noted that bertsch et al 2003 studied a simplified version of the problem considered in this article with only one trap location they have shown the existence and uniqueness of a solution satisfying the standard porous media equation with regularity away from the trap location in addition they also established that the solution is bounded in the present article we assume similar properties for the oil saturation in the case of arbitrarily distributed multiple traps in particular 0 u 1 we mention that bourgeat and panfilov 1998 investigates a similar problem as considered here although using a phase pressure saturation formulation for the two phase flow and not the fractional flow formulation as applied here where we apply continuity of flux and capillary pressure if u x i t 0 they apply continuity of the fluxes in each phase and of the pressure in each phase and hence also of the capillary pressure at the discontinuity in this present article we investigate the trapping phenomena in highly heterogeneous media in this context it may be noted that the capillary entry pressure has a significant impact on the trapping phenomena van duijn et al 2007 hence to incorporate the effect of the capillary entry pressure in this current setting it is necessary to assume that the capillary pressure is continuous only when oil phase is present on the either side of the discontinuity otherwise a jump in the capillary pressure is noticed at the interface moreover in their non dimensionalization they open for the permeability ratio and the ratio of characteristic capillary pressure values to also depend on the scale separation ϵ l l which is not considered here 3 homogenization technique for periodic layers here in this section we derive effective upscaled two phase flow equations for periodically distributed layers corresponding to the model equations introduced in the earlier section the present study includes the differences in entry pressure corresponding to the different homogeneous layers which is eventually the main reason for trapping at the micro scale 3 1 homogenization procedure in order to derive an effective upscaled model we make use of the homogenization technique hornung 1997 we refer to the model equations as described in section 2 the highly heterogeneous nature of the medium considered stems from the varying porosity ϕj and absolute permeability kj as depicted in fig 1 each of the homogeneous layers is of thickness l micro scale reference length which is very small compared to the macro scale reference length l naturally this leads to a small expansion parameter ϵ l l 1 one may note that the trapping effects are prominent in all the transitions from a high permeability to a low permeability region one may note the presence of two dimensionless numbers m and nc in the dimensionless eq 2 8 through the flux 2 9 van duijn et al 2002 analyzed the problem separately for the two specific cases of small and moderate capillary number nc while keeping the viscosity ratio m 1 in their investigation convergence results for balance case i e n c o ϵ are shown using numerical examples whereas these numerical evidences are really difficult to attain in the case of the capillary limit i e n c o 1 until the capillary effects are dominant this restriction is due to the micro scale assumption of continuity of the o ϵ term in the asymptotic expansion of the oil saturation later with a different micro scale assumption concerning the continuity of the o ϵ term in the asymptotic expansion of the capillary pressure van duijn et al 2007 investigated the capillary limit case and consequently derived the macro scale equations which are also suitable for flow regimes that are not dominated by capillary effects here we follow a similar approach as described in van duijn et al 2007 in this present investigation we look only at the capillary limit case and derive the corresponding effective equations for a highly heterogeneous porous structure one can now proceed with the derivation of the upscaled effective equations for ϵ 0 using the well known two scale or homogenization technique here we assume that all the quantities depend on the two spatial variables x the macro scale or slow variable and y x ϵ the micro scale or fast variable based on these two variables one may expand all the quantities involved in terms of ϵ and equate the similar order terms in ϵ here we proceed with the derivation of the effective upscaled equations with two sub cases namely i single discontinuity within a cell and ii multiple discontinuities within a cell details are presented in the forthcoming subsections 3 2 single discontinuity within a cell for notational convenience we assume that the periodic structures with traps are located at the points x i ϵ y i ϵ i i z refer fig 2 the corresponding permeability k ϵ x and the porosity ϕ ϵ x are defined by k ϵ x k x ϵ and ϕ ϵ x ϕ x ϵ where 3 1 k k i 1 on y 2 i y 2 i 1 k i 2 on y 2 i 1 y 2 i 2 3 2 ϕ ϕ i 1 on y 2 i y 2 i 1 ϕ i 2 on y 2 i 1 y 2 i 2 we distinguish two kinds of matching conditions one going from k i 1 to k i 2 and the other from k i 2 to k i 1 1 at x 2 i 1 ϵ we impose the following a for k i 1 k i 2 3 3a if u 2 i 1 ϵ u 2 i 1 then u 2 i 1 ϵ 0 if u 2 i 1 ϵ u 2 i 1 then ϕ i 1 k i 1 j u 2 i 1 ϵ ϕ i 2 k i 2 j u 2 i 1 ϵ b for k i 1 k i 2 3 3b if u 2 i 1 ϵ u 2 i 1 then ϕ i 2 k i 2 j u 2 i 1 ϵ ϕ i 1 k i 1 j u 2 i 1 ϵ if u 2 i 1 ϵ u 2 i 1 then u 2 i 1 ϵ 0 where u 2 i 1 ϵ lim x 2 i 1 ϵ u x u 2 i 1 ϵ lim x 2 i 1 ϵ u x and u 2 i 1 is the threshold entry point saturation for fluid to flow through the interface x 2 i 1 ϵ which has to be exceeded before the non wetting oil phase can enter the fine material low permeability region from the coarse material high permeability region this threshold saturation is uniquely defined as a if k i 1 k i 2 then 3 4a ϕ i 1 k i 1 j u 2 i 1 ϕ i 2 k i 2 j 0 b if k i 1 k i 2 then 3 4b ϕ i 1 k i 1 j 0 ϕ i 2 k i 2 j u 2 i 1 at x 2 i 2 ϵ we impose a similar matching condition as that of 3 3 depending on the criterion either k i 2 k i 1 1 or k i 2 k i 1 1 as a for k i 2 k i 1 1 3 5a if u 2 i 2 ϵ u 2 i 2 then u 2 i 2 ϵ 0 if u 2 i 2 ϵ u 2 i 2 then ϕ i 2 k i 2 j u 2 i 2 ϵ ϕ i 1 1 k i 1 1 j u 2 i 2 ϵ b for k i 2 k i 1 1 3 5b if u 2 i 2 ϵ u 2 i 2 then ϕ i 1 1 k i 1 1 j u 2 i 2 ϵ ϕ i 2 k i 2 j u 2 i 2 ϵ if u 2 i 2 ϵ u 2 i 2 then u 2 i 2 ϵ 0 where u 2 i 2 is the threshold entry point saturation for fluid to flow through the interface x 2 i 2 ϵ this is similarly defined as u 2 i 1 in eq 3 4 we now replace ϕ and k by ϕ ϵ and k ϵ in 2 8 and 2 9 now eqs 2 8 and 2 9 hold in the domain σ ϵ r t ϵ where t ϵ ϵ i z i let u ϵ be a solution of 2 8 satisfying the matching conditions 3 3 and 3 5 we consider the following two scale asymptotic expansion 3 6 u ϵ x t u 0 x y t ϵ u 1 x y t ϵ 2 u 2 x y t where the functions uj are periodic in y x ϵ the fast scale this assumption is the counterpart of the stationarity condition in a random medium for the two scale asymptotic expansion method of homogenization since the microstructure is periodic here the property is stronger i e each uj is y periodic auriault et al 2009 it is noted that the continuity of the first order term in the asymptotic expansion of oil saturation eq 3 6 at the interface between two homogeneous layers used in van duijn et al 2002 leads to enhanced diffusivity in the resulting upscaled equation van duijn et al 2007 moreover this also produces discontinuities of order ϵ in the capillary pressure however although these are at the micro scale they result in a significant effect at the macro scale van duijn et al 2007 these observations prompts us to adopt the approach proposed in van duijn et al 2007 i e the continuity of first order terms in the expansion of the capillary pressure the averaged solution of the micro scale model is compared with the effective solutions developed in van duijn et al 2002 2007 the averaged solution is found to be better represented by the effective solution developed in van duijn et al 2007 to proceed with the derivation of the upscaled model one may notice that the capillary pressure can be expanded asymptotically as 3 7 p c u ϵ ϕ x k x j u ϵ ϕ x k x j u 0 j u u u 0 δ u 2 j u u 2 u 0 δ u 2 with δ u ϵ u 1 ϵ 2 u 2 this becomes 3 8 p c u ϵ ϕ x k x j u 0 ϵ u 1 j u 0 o ϵ 2 the first two terms in the pc expansion are 3 9 p c 0 ϕ x k x j u 0 3 10 p c 1 ϕ x k x u 1 j u 0 it may be noted that the expansion 3 7 is admissible only when j u and its higher order partial derivatives exist and are continuous at u 0 substituting these expansions into 2 8 and equating the terms of the same order of ϵ gives equations for u 0 u 1 at different orders of ϵ the details follow we define the effective oil saturation as 3 11 u x t y 2 i y 2 i 2 ϕ y u 0 x y t d y y 2 i y 2 i 2 ϕ y d y which is the weak limit of u ϵ and where u 0 x y t is the leading order approximation to u ϵ in some norm schweizer 2008 proved the convergence of the homogenization procedure for nonlinear flow problems in inhomogeneous geometries which is similar to the setting considered in this present article capillary limit n

now incorporating the continuity of f ϵ we have 3 18 n c k λ u 0 p c 0 y f 0 f 0 x t which holds for every x y r and for all t 0 this is due to the continuity of the flux moreover we also have the

scale let us first consider the case k i 1 k i 2 assuming w y 2 i 1 j u 2 i 1 and using the strict monotonicity of w we get w y 2 i j u 2 i 1 giving w y 2 i j 0 this eventually contradicts the monotonic behaviour of w in y 2 i 1 y 2 i now assuming w y 2 i 1 j u 2 i 1 and the continuity of capillary pressure implies w y 2 i 1 ϕ i 1 k i 2 ϕ i 2 k i 1 w y 2 i 1 consequently from the relations 3 25 and 3 26 we have 3 27 w y 2 i 2 ϕ i 1 k i 2 ϕ i 2 k i 1 w y 2 i 1 f ϕ i 2 k i 2 ϵ λ ϕ i 1 k i 2 ϕ i 2 k i 1 w y 2 i f ϕ i 2 ϵ λ k i 2 k i 1 1 k i 2 repetition of this reasoning backwards in i shows that w will drop below j u 2 i 1 at the right half of a certain transition face which again leads to a contradiction hence f 0 0 similar arguments imply f 0 0 and hence f 0 0 now consider the case k i 1 k i 2 note that in this analysis flow direction is from left to right here in this case flow is from a low permeable medium to a relatively high permeable medium i e capillary pressure in the right portion of the transition face is lower than the same in the left side if the non wetting phase is present on both sides whereas in this scenario zero non wetting phase saturation in the right part eventually implies zero non wetting phase saturation in the left part as well hence in this case it is trivial that f 0 0 this conclusion allows us to solve eq 3 18 with the matching conditions 3 3 and 3 5 it may be noted that at the interface between the two homogeneous layers fluxes are continuous at all scales in addition to this the capillary pressure condition is also imposed at the interface and the periodicity is assumed at the end points of the cells these are satisfied only if u 0 is the lowest term in the asymptotic expansion 3 6 and is constant at the micro scale in the homogeneous layers in particular ci and c i are related by 3 28 c i j 1 ϕ i 1 k i 1 k i 2 ϕ i 2 j c i where ci and c i are the values of u 0 at the micro scale in the left and right part of the interface located at y 2 i 1 respectively now whenever c i 0 we find 3 29 u 0 y c i u 2 i 1 for y 2 i y y 2 i 1 c i for y 2 i 1 y y 2 i 2 if ci exceeds the threshold saturation u 2 i 1 and the non wetting phase can infiltrate into the immediate fine material or 3 30 u 0 y c i u 2 i 1 for y 2 i y y 2 i 1 0 for y 2 i 1 y y 2 i 2 if there is no non wetting phase flow from the high into the low permeable medium note that in the first case the capillary pressure is continuous at the transition face now consider the ϵ 1 eq 3 19 since f 0 0 and the flux is continuous we obtain f 1 f 1 x t using 3 29 and 3 30 the local form of f 1 is 3 31 f 1 f c i n c k i 1 λ c i p c 1 y p c 0 c i x for y 2 i y y 2 i 1 and 3 32 f 1 f c i n c k i 2 λ c i p c 1 y p c 0 c i x for c i u 2 i 1 0 for c i u 2 i 1 for y 2 i 1 y y 2 i 2 clearly one has to consider only the nontrivial case c i u 2 i 1 from 3 31 and 3 32 we obtain 3 33 p c 1 y f c i f 1 n c k i 1 λ c i p c 0 c i x b 1 x t for y 2 i y y 2 i 1 f c i f 1 n c k i 2 λ c i p c 0 c i x b 2 x t for y 2 i 1 y y 2 i 2 it is noted that after the integration b 1 b 2 0 thus one can solve for f 1 and obtain 3 34 f 1 1 k i 1 k r w c i 1 k i 2 k r w c i 1 k i 1 k r w c i f c i 1 k i 2 k r w c i f c i n c p c 0 c i x p c 0 c i x 1 k i 1 λ c i 1 k i 2 λ c i finally we use the ϵ0 eq 3 20 since f 2 is continuous in the fast scale we find the averaged oil saturation from eq 3 11 as 3 35 u x t y 2 i y 2 i 2 ϕ y u 0 x y t d y y 2 i y 2 i 2 ϕ y d y ϕ i 1 c i ϕ i 2 c i ϕ i 1 ϕ i 2 and the effective equation has the following form 3 36 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 2 2 u t x f u n c λ u x p c u 0 the effective saturation is expressed in terms of ci and c i for c i 0 we end up with the relation given in 3 28 this gives 3 37 u g c i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 2 ϕ i 1 c i ϕ i 2 j 1 ϕ i 1 k i 1 k i 2 ϕ i 2 j c i notice that g defined above maps 0 1 onto ϕ i 1 u 2 i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 2 1 as j is strictly increasing the function g shares the same property and can therefore be inverted hence one can write ci in terms of u as 3 38 c i g 1 u inserting the above into 3 28 one can obtain an equivalent expression for c i with the above expressions one can identify the upscaled fractional flow as 3 39 f u 0 for 0 u ϕ i 1 u 2 i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 2 1 k i 1 k r w c i 1 k i 2 k r w c i 1 k i 1 k r w c i f c i 1 k i 2 k r w c i f c i for ϕ i 1 u 2 i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 2 u 1 1 for u 1 this function can be interpreted as the weighted harmonic mean of the micro scale fractional flow the weight functions 1 k i 1 k r w c i and 1 k i 2 k r w c i depend on the water relative permeability which in turn depends on ci and c i the upscaled λ term is the harmonic average of the terms k i 1 λ c i and k i 2 λ c i 3 40 λ u 0 for 0 u ϕ i 1 u 2 i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 2 2 1 k i 1 λ c i 1 k i 2 λ c i for ϕ i 1 u 2 i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 2 u 1 0 for u 1 to express the upscaled capillary pressure we use 3 28 this means that whenever oil is present on both sides of the interface the first term in the expansion 3 8 is constant in the entire micro scale cell hence we get 3 41 p c u ϕ i 1 k i 1 j c i ϕ i 2 k i 2 j c i to determine the effective diffusivity d we use 3 38 3 40 and 3 41 which implies 3 42 d u λ u p c u where p c

layers for convenience we will present here considering n 4 results for any n are given in appendix a for notational convenience we assume that the periodic structures with traps are located at the points x i ϵ y i ϵ i i z the corresponding permeability k ϵ x and the porosity ϕ ϵ x are defined by k ϵ x k x ϵ and ϕ ϵ x ϕ x ϵ where 3 43 k k i 1 on y 4 i y 4 i 1 k i 2 on y 4 i 1 y 4 i 2 k i 3 on y

going from k i 1 to k i 2 a second from k i 2 to k i 3 another from k i 3 to k i 4 and finally from k i 4 to k i 1 1 note that we impose matching conditions similar to eqs 3 3 and 3 5 at the locations x 4 i 1 ϵ x 4 i 2 ϵ x 4 i 3 ϵ and x 4 i 4 ϵ it may be noted that the unit cell construction used in fig 3 is referred to as the original or non shifted approach in the rest of this article from eq 3 23 with similar arguments as before one can prove that f 0 0 this conclusion allows us to solve eq 3 18 with the matching conditions similar to eqs 3 3 and 3 5 in the case of a single transition within a cell fluid can pass through the cell whenever it exceeds the threshold saturation at that transition face however for multiple transitions within a cell fluid can pass through the cell only if it exceeds the maximum threshold saturation of the transition faces otherwise fluid flow may cease at any of the transition faces having higher threshold saturation in this context we find different possibilities as follows 3 45 u 0 y c i 1 u 4 i 1 for y 4 i y y 4 i 1 c i 2 u 4 i 2 for y 4 i 1 y y 4 i 2 c i 3 u 4 i 3 for y 4 i 2 y y 4 i 3 c i 4 for y 4 i 3 y y 4 i 4 where 3 46a c i 2 j

u 4 i 3 respectively and the non wetting phase can infiltrate into the next fine material on the other hand if c i 1 c i 2 exceeds the threshold saturations u 4 i 1 u 4 i 2 respectively but c i 3 stays below or equal to u 4 i 3 and the non wetting phase can not infiltrate into the next fine material at the fourth compartment block of the cell i e y 4 i 3 y y 4 i 4 then 3 47 u 0 y c i 1 u 4 i 1 for y 4 i y y 4 i 1 c i 2 u 4 i 2 for y 4 i 1 y y 4 i 2 c i 3 u 4 i 3 for y 4 i 2 y y 4 i 3 0 for y 4 i 3 y y 4 i 4 further if c i 1 exceeds the threshold saturation u 4 i 1 but c i 2 stays below or equal to u 4 i 2 and the non wetting phase can not infiltrate into the next fine material at the third compartment of the cell i e y 4 i 2 y y 4 i 3 and consequently in the fourth compartment then 3 48 u 0 y c i 1 u 4 i 1 for y 4 i y y 4 i 1 c i 2 u 4 i 2 for y 4 i 1 y y 4 i 2 0 for y 4 i 2 y y 4 i 3 0 for y 4 i 3 y y 4 i 4 finally if c i 1 stays below or equal to u 4 i 1 and the non wetting phase can not infiltrate into the next fine material at the second compartment of the cell i e y 4 i 1 y y 4 i 2 and also the consequent compartments then we have 3 49 u 0 y c i 1 u 4 i 1 for y 4 i y y 4 i 1 0 for y 4 i 1 y y 4 i 2 0 for y 4 i 2 y y 4 i 3 0 for y 4 i 3 y y 4 i 4 note that in the first case the capillary pressure is continuous at all the transition faces in the second case the capillary pressure is continuous at the first two transition faces further in the third case the capillary pressure is only continuous at the first transition face whereas in the fourth case the capillary pressure is discontinuous at all the transition faces here in this subsection we will only point out the differences between the single discontinuity case and the multiple discontinuities case for the effective equations for all the necessary steps in the derivation we refer to the previous subsection and also to van duijn et al 2007 for multiple transitions within a cell we define the averaged oil saturation as 3 50 u x t y 4 i y 4 i 4 ϕ y u 0 x y t d y y 4 i y 4 i 4 ϕ y d y ϕ i 1 c i 1 ϕ i 2 c i 2 ϕ i 3 c i 3 ϕ i 4 c i 4 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 2 ϕ i 3 ϕ i 4 and the corresponding effective

function g shares the same property and can therefore be inverted hence one can write c i 1 in terms of u as 3 53 c i 1 g 1 u inserting the above into 3 46 one can obtain equivalent expressions for c i j j 2 3 4 note that fluid flow can be ceased at any of the transition faces unless it exceeds the corresponding threshold saturation hence it can pass through any of the transitions including the entire cell considering this and with the above expressions one can identify the upscaled fractional flow as 3 54 f u 0 for 0 u ϕ i 1 u 4 i 1 j 1 4 ϕ i j j 1 2 1 k i j k r w c i j j 1 2 1 k i j k r w

interpreted as the weighted harmonic mean of the micro scale fractional flow the weight functions 1 k i j k r w c i j j 1 2 3 4 depend on the water relative permeability which eventually depend on c i j j 1 2 3 4 note that the harmonic means in 3 54 are only over the layers for which fluid could enter this is to illustrate the potential effect that fluid could enter partly into a macroscopic grid cell with several layers but not completely through for example if the saturation is such that fluid can enter the first two blocks but is too low to proceed to the third one would be in the second case of 3 54 note however that it would not be possible for the flow to pass through the entire cell in this case the upscaled λ term is the harmonic average of the terms k i j λ c i j j 1 2 3 4 3 55

case of partial intrusion second and third case but we note that there would not be any diffusion across the macro scale block to express the upscaled capillary pressure we use 3 46 this means that whenever oil is present on both sides of all the interfaces the first term in the expansion 3 8 is constant in the entire micro scale cell hence we get 3 56 p c u ϕ i 1 k i 1 j c i 1 ϕ i 2 k i 2 j c i

that when the permeability in k i 4 last compartment block of ith cell is much larger than k i 1 1 first compartment block of i 1 th cell the choice of the above cell as in fig 3 may not be a good periodic structure for the upscaling procedure since the threshold saturation value at the micro scale location y 4 i 4 controls significantly the flow transitions from the ith to i 1 th cell in this context we consider a shifted periodic structure refer fig 4 for a medium with a staircase upwards type porosity and intrinsic permeability distribution refer fig 5 please note that the upscaled quantities can be derived in a similar way as earlier here in the following we only hint the deviations in the local reconstruction of the flow quantities for notational convenience we assume that the periodic structures with traps are located at the points x i ϵ y i ϵ i i z the corresponding permeability k ϵ x and the porosity ϕ ϵ x are defined by k ϵ x k x ϵ and ϕ ϵ x ϕ x ϵ where 3 58 k k i 1 on

distinguish four kinds of matching conditions one going from k i 1 to k i 2 other from k i 2 to k i 3 other from k i 3 to k i 4 and another from k i 4 to k i 1 1 note that we impose matching

wetting phase can infiltrate into the next fine material we also have other possibilities analogous to the original approach given in eqs 3 47 3 49 however to compute the effective quantities we require c i j 0 j hence these alternatives are not relevant and to avoid repetitions we skip these expressions now in the case of the shifted approach for multiple transitions within a cell we define

distributed blocks in this section we derive effective equations for a random distribution of blocks refer to fig 6 in the capillary limit here we present the derivation for the cell with a single discontinuity and for multiple discontinuities we refer to appendix b the derivation steps are similar to the approach explained by van duijn et al 2002 and are thus only explained briefly however here we assume the continuity of the first order term in the asymptotic expansion of the capillary pressure instead of the oil saturation that is used in van duijn et al 2002 we give more attention to the differences between the approach of van duijn et al 2002 and what is followed here in this study we consider a stationary ergodic geometrical structure instead of a periodic distribution of blocks a stationary ergodic structure is a stochastic structure that exhibits both stationarity and ergodicity essentially this implies that the random structure will not change its statistical properties with time and that its statistical properties can be deduced from a single sufficiently large random sample of the process daley and vere jones 1988 papanicolaou 1995 it is assumed that the stationary ergodic structure is characterized by a probability space ω μ along with an ergodic dynamical system t x x r papanicolaou 1995 van duijn et al 2002 now for a μ measurable subset p ω we introduce p p ω r by 4 1 p ω x r t x ω p which is a random stationary set in this case we assume that p ω is of the form 4 2 p ω i z y 2 i y 2 i 1 in which y i r are strictly increasing random variables with respect to i according to the ergodic theorem of birkhoff 1931 there exists a density function of p given by 4 3 ψ μ p lim a b 1 y 2 b y 2 a a b y 2 i 1 ω y 2 i ω for nearly all ω ω satisfying 0 ψ 1 the corresponding random porosity and absolute permeability is given by 4 4 ϕ x i ω ϕ t x i ω ϕ i 1 if x i p ϕ i 2 if x i r p 4 5 k x i ω k t x i ω k i 1 if x i p k i 2 if x i r p note that porosity ϕ and absolute permeability k are stationary random variables now 4 6 ϕ ϵ x ω ϕ t x ϵ ω and k ϵ x ω k t x ϵ ω consequently u i u i ω through the relation 3 4 this being stochastic we use the two scale asymptotic expansion for the saturation capillary pressure and flux function given by relation 3 6 3 7 and 3 16 respectively note that here fj are stationary ergodic random fields using these expansions in eq 3 14 we get 4 7 f 0 y 0 f 0 f 0 x t while the random variable p c 0 satisfies the eq 3 18 now for a given realization of ω one needs to reconsider this eq 3 18 following analogous steps as van duijn et al 2002 and as in the periodic layer case it follows that f 0 0 now for i z 4 8 u 0 y ω c i ω u 2 i 1 ω for y 2 i ω y y 2 i 1 ω c i ω j 1 ϕ i 1 k i 1 k i 2 ϕ i 2 j c i ω for y 2

for y 2 i 1 ω y y 2 i 2 ω if there is no non wetting phase flow from high to low permeable medium note that in the first case capillary pressure is continuous at the transition face now consider the o ϵ 1 eq 3 19 as f 0 0 the ergodic nature of f 1 suggests that f 1 f 1 x t and given by 4 10 f 1 f u 0 n c k i ω λ u 0 p c 1 y p c 0 x let c i ω u 2 i 1 ω then f 1 0 on y 2 i ω y 2 i 1 ω implies f 1 0 x r and t 0 next if c i ω u 2 i 1 ω then 4 11 p c 1 y f c i ω f 1 n c k i 1 ω λ c i ω p c 0 c i ω x b 1 ω for y 2 i ω y y 2 i 1 ω f c i ω f 1 n c k i 2 ω λ c i ω p c 0 c i ω x b 2 ω for y 2 i 1 ω y y 2 i 2 ω it may be noted that van duijn et al 2002 has the local representation for u 1 y however in this article we have the same for p c 1 y this is due to the differences in the micro scale assumption between van duijn et al 2002 and the present study since p c 1 y is the local representation of a stationary random variable with zero mean we get 4 12 χ 1 b 1 ω χ 2 b 2 ω 0 where χ is the characteristic function now eq 4 12 gives 4 13 ψ f c i ω f 1 n c k i 1 ω λ c i ω 1 ψ f c i ω f 1 n c k i 2 ω λ c i ω ψ p c 0 c i ω x 1 ψ p c 0 c i ω x eq 4 13 can be solved for f 1 and we obtain dropping ω dependency for convenience 4 14 f 1 ψ k i 1 k r w c i 1 ψ k i 2 k r w c i ψ k i 1 k r w c i f c i 1 ψ k i 2 k r w c i f c i n c ψ p c 0 c i x 1 ψ p c 0 c i x ψ k i 1 λ c i 1 ψ k i 2 λ c i finally we use the o ϵ 0 eq 3 20 using the ergodic nature of f 2 we find the averaged oil saturation from eq 3 11 as 4 15 u x t y 2 i y 2 i 2 ϕ y u 0 x y t d y y 2 i y 2 i 2 ϕ y d y ψ ϕ i 1 c i 1 ψ ϕ

c i ω 0 we have 4 17 u g c i ω 1 ψ ϕ i 1 1 ψ ϕ i 2 ψ ϕ i 1 c i ω 1 ψ ϕ i 2 j 1 ϕ i 1 k i 1 k i 2 ϕ i 2 j c i ω note that g defined above maps 0 1 onto ψ ϕ i 1 u 2 i 1 ψ ϕ i 1 1 ψ ϕ i 2 1 we use similar arguments to write ci ω in terms of u as in eq 3 38 with the above expressions one can identify the effective upscaled fractional flow as 4 18 f u 0 for 0 u ψ ϕ i 1 u 2 i 1 ψ ϕ i 1 1 ψ ϕ i 2 ψ

harmonic mean of the micro scale fractional flow function as in the periodic layer case here we mention that the difference in the effective fractional flow in van duijn et al 2002 compared to the present study is in terms of the weights a straightforward mathematical calculation shows that the weights in van duijn et al 2002 are ψ k i 1 k r w c i j c i and 1 ψ k i 2 k r w c i j c i we refer to appendix b for the functional form of the effective fractional flow in case of multiple discontinuities in addition the effective upscaled λ term is also the harmonic average of the micro scale quantities hence given by 4 19 λ u 0 for 0 u ψ ϕ i 1 u 2 i 1 ψ ϕ i 1 1 ψ ϕ i 2 1 ψ k i 1 λ c i 1 ψ k i 2 λ c i for ψ ϕ i 1 u 2 i 1 ψ ϕ i 1 1 ψ ϕ i 2 u 1 0 for u 1 for the effective λ term in case of multiple discontinuities refer to appendix b with similar arguments as in the periodic case one can also define the effective capillary pressure and the effective diffusivity following the eqs 3 41 and 3 42 respectively note that for a single discontinuity in a cell the periodic case corresponds to ψ 1 2 hence for each realization ω we end up with an effective equation similar to the periodic case eq 3 36 in addition one may observe that for ψ 1 2 the average oil saturation relation 4 15 reduces to the relation 3 35 which is the average oil saturation for the periodic case 5 comparison between micro scale and upscaled model we here compare the original micro scale eq 2 8 and the upscaled equation for periodic layers 3 36 or 3 51 with special emphasis on showing the differences with respect to the upscaled equation developed in van duijn et al 2007 we first describe the numerical implementation of the equations before moving to the numerical examples for all the numerical examples we let n c 1 and consider the following brooks corey type relative permeabilities and leverett type capillary pressure 5 1 k r w u 1 u 2 k r n w u 2 j u 1 u 1 2 in van duijn et al 2007 2002 the porosity was always constant and our model reduces to the model found in van duijn et al 2007 when the porosity is set as constant and averaging over two blocks hence the model of van duijn et al 2007 can be seen as a special case of the model derived in the current paper when allowing porosity to vary with the permeability we will in most of the numerical examples assume a kozeny carman like relation between the non dimensional permeability and porosity that is 5 2 k ϕ ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 γ with a material constant γ 2 5 however note that the considered models and the upscaling procedure in the previous sections do not rely on such a relation between porosity and permeability and is mainly applied for convenience for all the simulations we consider the initial condition 5 3 u t 0 0 9999 and u t 0 0 9999 for the micro scale and the upscaled equations respectively the reason for not using an initial value of 1 is to avoid the singularity of the capillary pressure 5 1 the corresponding boundary conditions over the domain x 0 2 are 5 4 u x 0 0 and u x x 2 0 and correspondingly for the upscaled saturation u 5 1 numerical discretization of the micro scale equation implementing the original eqs 2 8 is a non trivial task due to the discontinuities appearing at the transitions between the permeability layers the main steps follow the approach developed and applied by van duijn et al 2002 2007 hence we explain these only in brief we give more attention to the differences between the numerical approach of van duijn et al 2002 and the current one the micro scale eq 2 8 will be discretized with a cell centered two point finite volume scheme using upwinding for the spatial discretization and forward euler for the time discretization such an approach has proven successful in previous applications as by van duijn et al 2002 2007 and is analyzed by evje and karlsen 2000 dealing with the fluxes at the transitions between the layers is of high importance to correctly capture the trapping and to get an accurate numerical approximation therefore we adopt a similar strategy here as applied by van duijn et al 2002 2007 however similar considerations to incorporate capillary pressure conditions and entry pressure effects are also taken into account by ern et al 2010 henning et al 2013 duijn et al 1995 van duijn et al 2016 discretizations with such modified flux calculations are also investigated analytically by brenner et al 2013 enchery et al 2006 henning et al 2015 jaffré 1995 we mention that although the choice of explicit time discretization gives a time step restriction the explicit time discretization also makes each time step much cheaper as fewer nonlinear problems have to be solved the domain x 0 2 is divided into uniform grid cells where we use more grid cells than number of discontinuities and where grid cell j is the interval x x j 1 2 x j 1 2 j j 1 δ x and δx is the grid size the cell center xj is hence located in j 1 2 δ x for the time discretization we use forward euler with a constant time step δt the flow is always from left to right and we apply upwinding for the advective flux we let u j k denote the discrete unknown in grid cell j at time step k the grid size is such that a discontinuity in permeability porosity always occurs on a grid edge we first describe the discretization away from the discontinuities before explaining the procedure for correctly incorporating the discontinuities on the transitions discontinuities are found in both permeability k x and in porosity ϕ x but these are assumed to occur at the same locations hence for an interior unknown u j k 1 away from a discontinuity in permeability and porosity we have 5 5 u j k 1 u j k δ t δ x ϕ j f j 1 2 k f j 1 2 k where f j 1 2 k is the approximation of the flux function 2 9 on the edges x j 1 2 similarly as van duijn et al 2002 and evje and karlsen 2000 we apply a kirchhoff transformation to the capillary pressure term in 2 9 we define 5 6 β u 0 u k r w v f v j v d v where β u is now a strictly increasing function in u and smooth for our choices of krw u krnw u and j u the flux function 2 9 can then be approximated as 5 7 f j 1 2 k f u j k n c ϕ j k j β u j 1 k β u j k δ x where ϕj and kj are the constant porosity and permeability found in grid cell j when there is a discontinuity in porosity and permeability on the cell edge x j 1 2 we have to modify the corresponding approximation of the flux f j 1 2 k to this aim we use a similar approach as van duijn et al 2002 but include also the effect of the varying porosity in this case the permeability and porosity values in grid cells j and j 1 are different and are denoted by kj k j 1 and ϕj ϕ j 1 to determine the correct flux on x j 1 2 we apply the capillary pressure conditions as described in 3 3 we introduce dummy variables u j k and u j k representing the saturation just left and right of the edge x j 1 2 respectively as in van duijn et al 2002 we separate between transitions from low to high or from high to low permeability to calculate u j k and to modify the fluxes following the capillary pressure conditions 3 3 we have a if k j k j 1 then 5 8a if u j k u j then u j k 0 if u j k u j then ϕ j k j j u j k ϕ j 1 k j 1 j u j k b if k j k j 1 then 5 8b if u j k u j then ϕ j 1 k j 1 j u j k ϕ j k j j u j k if u j k u j then u j k 0 where u j is the threshold saturation associated with the edge x j 1 2 defined similarly as 3 4 the flux f j 1 2 k is modified using values only from the left or the right side of the edge x j 1 2 that is 5 9a f j 1 2 k f u j k n c k j ϕ j β u j k β u j k δ x 2 5 9b f j 1 2 k f u j k n c k j 1 ϕ j 1 β u j 1 k β u j k δ x 2 from the assumptions on u j k these two fluxes have to be equal since u j k is known we reformulate 5 9 together with 5 8 as equations for determining u j k we are searching for the zero of the function 5 10 g u j k u j k δ x 2 f u j k n c k j 1 ϕ j 1 β u j k n c k j ϕ j β u j k t where t is given by 5 11 t δ x 2 f u j k n c k j 1 ϕ j 1 β u j 1 k n c k j ϕ j β u j k note that g u j k u j k is a strictly increasing function in both arguments we assume that a cfl condition is fulfilled such that t δ x 2 n c k j ϕ j k j 1 ϕ j 1 β 1 to incorporate the capillary pressure conditions we separate between four cases corresponding to 5 8 we emphasize that van duijn et al 2002 describes the same cases with respect to shifts in permeability but uses different bounds on t than considered in the following first assume k j k j 1 and that t n c ϕ j k j β u j in this case the function g u j k 0 has a unique zero in the interval u j k 0 u j it hence follows that u j k 0 and the first pressure condition in 5 8a is fulfilled secondly if k j k j 1 and n c ϕ j k j β u j t the only possibility for g u j k u j k to reach zero is for a non zero u j k and u j k u j and we are in the second case of 5 8a we hence search for the unique solution u j k u j 1 and u j k j 1 ϕ j k j 1 k j ϕ j 1 j u j k 0 fulfilling g u j k u j k 0 similarly when k j k j 1 and t δ x 2 f u j n c ϕ j 1 k j 1 β u j the function g 0 u j k has a unique zero in the interval u j k 0 u j in this case u j k 0 fulfilling the second pressure condition in 5 8b finally if k j k j 1 and δ x 2 f u j n c ϕ j 1 k j 1 β u j t the function g u j k u j k has a unique zero fulfilling u j k u j 1 and u j k j 1 ϕ j 1 k j k j 1 ϕ j j u j k 0 although van duijn et al 2002 considered the same cases as here with constant ϕ with the corresponding reasoning they use the opposite cases for t giving unique solutions for when k j k j 1 and k j k j 1 the bounds given by van duijn et al 2002 cannot yield unique solutions for u j k and u j k under their conditions it seems that they simply switched the cases k j k j 1 and k j k j 1 while describing the bounds we could only reproduce their simulation results when using the cases for t as described here these four cases cover the conditions in 5 8 and enable us to determine the modified fluxes 5 9 on edges x j 1 2 where the permeability and porosity is discontinuous any of the two expressions in 5 9 can be applied in 5 5 as they are equal the values for u j k have to be updated for every time step but depend only on information from the previous known time step to ensure that the saturation remains within the physical bounds 0 and up to 1 we get a time step restriction in 5 5 following arguments by evje and karlsen 2000 we get for 5 5 that 5 12 δ t δ x max u 0 1 f u 2 n c δ x max x 0 2 ϕ x k x max u 0 1 β u min x 0 2 ϕ x guarantees a solution within these bounds as long the initial condition fulfills these for a domain with many discontinuities in the permeability and porosity a very small grid size δx will be needed which will also pose severe restrictions on the time step δt for example for δ x 1 512 n c 1 m 1 ϕ varying between 0 5 and 0 66 and maximum k being 1 we get δ t 9 10 6 the simulations in section 5 3 are made with a time step fulfilling 5 12 hence the saturations are expected to remain within 0 1 as proven by pop and yong 2002 although we use the initial condition 5 3 which is below 1 we could in theory have that the saturation in the first time steps increases to saturation values very close to 1 near the layer transitions which would lead to numerical difficulties this was however not the case for the examples considered in the current study where only a small increase related to the machine precision was encountered 5 2 numerical discretization of the upscaled equations the upscaled eqs 3 36 3 51 and 4 16 are also discretized using a cell centered finite volume scheme although the upscaled solution represents the case where the number of layers have approached infinity we will generally use the same number of grid points for the upscaled solution as there are layers divided by the number of layers we average over in this case the upscaled solution has the same number of grid points as the averaged micro scale solution giving a fair comparison between the two solutions hence if considering a case with e g 16 layers with every second low and high permeabilities and porosities we would only apply 8 upscaled grid cells when considering the formulation from section 3 2 for 3 36 and 3 51 a uniform grid is applied each grid cell j is the interval x x j 1 2 x j 1 2 j j 1 δ x where δx is the grid size but where the grid size is now determined by the number of permeability and porosity layers and of how many are averaged over the cell center xj is located in j 1 2 δ x if there are n layers in total and we average over n layers where n n is an integer the discretization of the upscaled model hence has n n grid cells and δ x 2 n n but δx can also be chosen differently and in this case there is no connection between the number of grid points used for the upscaled solution and the actual number of layers for the randomly distributed blocks the upscaled eq 4 16 is discretized on a non uniform grid that reflects the widths of the underlying random layers that are averaged over here each grid cell j is the interval x x j 1 2 x j 1 2 where δ x j x j 1 2 x j 1 2 and the cell center xj is in x j x j 1 2 x j 1 2 2 the flow is always from left to right and we apply upwinding for the time discretization we use forward euler with a constant time step δt letting u j k denote the discrete unknown in grid cell j at time step k the upscaled eqs 3 36 3 51 or 4 16 is 5 13 u j k 1 u j k δ t δ x j ϕ j g j 1 2 k g j 1 2 k where g j 1 2 k is the approximation of the flux found in 3 36 3 51 or 4 16 and ϕ j is the average of the n porosities found in grid cell j this average is weighted with respect to the layer widths in the random case note that for 3 36 and 3 51 the grid size is constant the upscaled flux g is approximated by 5 14 g j 1 2 k f u j k n c λ j 1 2 k p c u j 1 k p c u j k δ x j 1 2 where λ j 1 2 k is the width weighted harmonic average of the λ u j 1 k and of λ u j k where λ u is given by 3 40 for n 2 by 3 55 or 3 65 for n 4 and by 4 19 for the randomly distributed blocks the upscaled fractional flow function f u is given by 3 39 for n 2 by 3 54 or 3 64 for n 4 and by 4 18 for the random blocks the averaged grid size δ x j 1 2 δ x j δ x j 1 2 is used in the case for the randomly distributed blocks 4 16 but is constant equal to δx for 3 36 and 3 51 to evaluate f u j k and λ u j k the local saturations have to be reconstructed for each layer found within grid cell j as explained in sections 3 2 3 3 and 4 the discontinuities between the layers are incorporated into the upscaled equations hence they do not require any special attention except to ensure that the local reconstruction remains within 0 1 hence 5 13 is applied for the entire domain similarly as with the discretization for the micro scale equations we get a bound on the time step size in 5 13 to ensure solutions remaining between 0 and up to 1 here we get 5 15 δ t δ x max u 0 1 f u 2 n c δ x max u 0 1 λ u p c u min x 0 2 ϕ x in the case of a non uniform grid the above bound should be fulfilled with respect to the smallest appearing grid size as the upscaled equations are in general solved on a much coarser mesh this constraint will not be a severe one for the numerical examples in the following section the upscaled equations are solved with the same time step as applied for the corresponding micro scale equations which always fulfilled the upscaled time step constraint 5 3 numerical examples we first assess the behavior of the micro scale and upscaled equations with respect to an increasing number of repeated layers and assess the effect of averaging over several layers as well as the number of grid points used further we compare our model to van duijn et al 2007 and show the differences that appear when letting the porosity vary before considering the effect of large permeability and porosity difference and viscosity ratio we then assess some interesting behavior when letting n 2 and finally we address a case with randomly distributed blocks the original non shifted approach is applied for the upscaled equations unless otherwise is stated unless otherwise stated we apply for the micro scale simulations n x 8 grid points within each layer and hence nx n grid points in total for n layers while for the upscaled equations we apply n n grid points 5 3 1 behavior with respect to number of grid points and averaging layers we let n denote the total number of layers between x 0 2 the permeability values are oscillating between 0 2 and 0 4 with corresponding porosity values of 0 5 and 0 57 we let the viscosity ratio be m 1 increasing n for the micro scale equations corresponds to layers becoming thinner and the medium acting more homogeneous fig 7 shows the average behavior of the micro scale equations black lines where the solution has been averaged over the two internal layers the micro scale simulations have here used a discretization with n x 8 grid points in each layer the average is a porosity weighted average to coincide with the averaging applied in the upscaling procedure in fig 7 we also show the convergence of the upscaled solution with respect to refining the grid as mentioned in section 5 2 the number of grid points for the upscaled equations can but does not have to represent the number of layers we here use n to denote the number of layers also for the upscaled equations since we always average over two layers this means n 2 grid points have been used this way the averaged and upscaled solutions with same n in fig 7 use the same number of grid points the purple lines are the results of the upscaled equations where we always average over two transitions hence n 2 the upscaled solution shows a small overestimate of the saturation values near the inlet as also observed in van duijn et al 2007 for constant porosities this overestimate is however decreasing with increasing n hence fig 7 shows how the increasing number of layers support a converging average behavior while increasing number of grid points for the upscaled equations also support convergence and that these two approaches converge towards the same averaged upscaled solution in the following we will always use n n grid points for the upscaled equations one can of course use a larger amount of grid points but this choice give a more fair comparison with the averaged solution as they then have the same number of grid points we now fix n 128 and assess the effect of averaging or upscaling over two or more internal layers the setting is the same as before with permeability values oscillating between 0 2 and 0 4 porosity between 0 5 and 0 57 and viscosity ratio is m 1 the original micro scale equations are solved for n 128 and with n x 8 grid points within each layer and the micro scale solution is averaged using porosity weighted averages over n 2 n 4 and n 8 layers also the upscaled equations are correspondingly solved for when averaging over n 2 n 4 and n 8 layers using n n grid points the results are seen in fig 8 note that when solving the n 8 upscaled equations only 16 macro scale grid points are used this gives a very cheap and fairly accurate discretization although the shape of the front is not captured so accurately due to a low amount of grid points however from fig 8 it is clear that all the upscaled approaches do a good job in approximating the average behavior of the micro scale equations as in fig 7 we see a slight overestimate of the upscaled solutions compared to the averaged micro scale solutions however this overestimate is less when only averaging over n 2 finally we assess the grid convergence of the micro scale equations we here fix n 96 layers and let nx be the number of grid points used within each layer fig 9 shows the micro scale solutions using n x 4 8 16 grid points within each layer the zoomed in view in the right part of fig 9 shows that n x 4 is deviating slightly from the other two near the block transitions while n x 8 and n x 16 give very similar results at the micro scale the averaged solutions are visually identical for all three cases with the averaged n x 4 solution lying slightly above the other two calculating the l2 norm of the difference between the two coarser solutions with the n x 16 solution gives 6 6 10 3 and 2 6 10 3 for n x 4 for the averaged and micro scale solution respectively and 2 2 10 3 and 9 1 10 4 for n x 8 the small difference between n x 8 and n x 16 both for the micro scale solution and the averaged solution indicates that the gain of increasing the number of grid points per layer is marginal we will hence use n x 8 grid points for each layer in all following numerical examples 5 3 2 constant versus varying porosity we now consider n 128 and let the permeability vary between k 0 2 and k 0 4 to compare with the model considered by van duijn et al 2007 we either let the porosity be constant or vary between ϕ 0 5 and ϕ 0 57 with the fine and coarse layers fig 10 shows the average of the micro scale equations and the upscaled equations n 2 for each of the two cases together with a zoomed in view of also the original micro scale solution since van duijn et al 2007 has incorporated the porosity into the non dimensionalization we calculate a corresponding non dimensional time for the varying porosity based on the average porosity the effect of varying porosity mainly affects the slope of the saturation front also the varying porosity gives a different internal distribution of the saturation between the fine and the coarse layers 5 3 3 effect of strong discontinuity between layers if increasing the permeability and porosity ratio between the repeating layers the effect is similar as observed in van duijn et al 2007 where the front becomes more steep we here apply repeating layers of permeability k 0 2 and k 1 while porosity correspondingly oscillates between ϕ 0 5 and ϕ 0 66 fig 11 shows the upscaled and averaged solution after t 0 1 t 0 3 and t 0 5 using n 128 and n 2 both for the averaged and upscaled solutions comparing to the solutions found with a smaller permeability and porosity difference in figs 8 and 10 we see that the averaged and upscaled solutions approach a higher plateau level as expected also the micro scale oscillations are much larger where substantially larger saturation values are found in the high porosity and permeability layers we consider now a larger permeability ratio and also explore a different relation between porosity and permeability than the kozeny carman relation 5 2 the repeating layers have a permeability of k 0 1 and k 1 while porosity either follows 5 2 giving ϕ 0 43 and ϕ 0 66 in the layers or we consider porosities of ϕ 0 2 and ϕ 0 8 in the layers to at the same time show how a larger porosity ratio affects the behavior the averaged and upscaled results at time t 0 25 using n 128 and n 2 are shown in fig 12 where the results marked kc corresponds to the porosity ratio following 5 2 while the results marked large have the larger porosity ratio compared to fig 11 we see that the plateau values of trapped oil near the inlet is even larger for both cases although the averaged and upscaled behavior of the kc and large cases are quite similar with only a minor difference in the front speed and the internal distribution of the micro scale solution is quite different the difference in front speed can be connected to the average porosity being different note that the averaged and upscaled solutions are based on porosity weighted averages in the case of a large porosity difference between the layers the larger saturations in the high porosity layers have a large impact on the averaged solution the increased porosity ratio between the layers makes the jump in the micro scale saturation between the layers smaller which was also observed in fig 10 5 3 4 effect of large viscosity ratio we also consider the viscosity ratio between the fluids being large namely m 5 and m 10 going back to the n 128 permeability and porosity layers of k 0 2 and k 0 4 and ϕ 0 5 and ϕ 0 57 as earlier and average over n 2 we obtain the averaged and upscaled solutions found in fig 13 the solutions are shown at the times t 0 1 t 0 25 and t 0 4 which approximately corresponds to the times of t 0 2 t 0 5 and t 0 8 considered in van duijn et al 2007 also when including varying porosity we see that the larger viscosity ratios lead to a more smooth front as capillary forces become more dominant and the front speed increases this is particularly more visible for m 10 the zoomed in view in the right part of fig 13 also shows how the increasing viscosity ratio allows more trapping of fluid near the inlet in both the high permeability and low permeability layers 5 3 5 four repeated layers we here design two test cases where four layers are repeated throughout the domain the four layers have increasingly finer coarser permeabilities and porosities and attain the values k i 1 0 2 k i 2 0 34 k i 3 0 58 k i 4 0 99 ϕ i 1 0 5 ϕ i 2 0 55 ϕ i 3 0 61 ϕ i 4 0 66 these values are periodically repeated through the domain and we consider two cases one where the internal distribution is a staircase upwards with stepwise increasing values as in the above equation and the other where the internal distribution is a staircase downwards where the permeabilities and porosities are stepwise decreasing oppositely as the above equation these two distributions represent the extreme cases that can be expected when there are four repeated values this is due to the fact that both include a step between the highest and lowest porosity and permeability values in particular for the staircase upwards case the step from the last high permeability layer to the first low permeability layer poses a severe restriction on the flow for this case the shifted upscaling approach is expected to better represent the average behavior the staircase downwards case has several minor steps that all limit the flow while the large step from the last low permeability layer to the first high permeability layer does not pose a restriction here both the upscaling approaches are expected to behave reasonably well although the permeability and porosity values are the same in these two cases the effective fractional flow functions and effective diffusivity are generally not the same when averaging over n 4 the reason is that the local reconstructions of the saturation values using 3 52 or 3 63 are different however if applying the original multi block averaging described in section 3 3 the effective diffusivity 3 57 and fractional flow 3 54 functions are the same for values larger than u 0 45 and they would both approach zero as u 0 45 this is due to only the internal transitions being properly accounted for especially for the staircase upwards case this is a crude approach as the transition from the last high permeability block into the first low permeability block in the next cell represents a large restriction on the flow in figs 14 and 15 the effective fractional flow 3 54 and 3 64 and diffusivity 3 57 and 3 67 using the original and shifted approach for the staircase upwards and downwards cases are shown as mentioned earlier the original approach gives curves that are similar to each other and they are identical for u 0 45 compared to the fractional flow and effective diffusivity found in e g van duijn et al 2007 we see a non monotone behavior for low values of u in the effective quantities in the staircase downwards case recall that the effective fractional flow 3 54 and 3 64 and diffusivity 3 57 and 3 67 are defined as the harmonic averages over the layers where fluid could enter this non monotone behavior is due to the fluid in this case would theoretically be able to enter the first high permeability block or two first blocks in the cell but not pass through the cell completely as the last block represents the largest restriction on the flow only the staircase downwards case includes such artifacts as the internal transitions pose restrictions on the flow while for the staircase upwards case the flow could infiltrate the entire layer when being able to enter the first low permeability layer however since we initially start with a large saturation which gradually decreases the effective saturation u will not reach values below u 0 45 or u 0 48 as the effective quantities do not allow any fluid movement then values below u 0 45 or u 0 48 correspond to at least one block those with lowest porosity and permeability having zero saturation this means that the non monotone behavior seen in the effective flux and diffusivity functions is not relevant as we will not be able to attain effective saturation values below 0 45 or 0 48 for the staircase downwards case we also see that for the shifted approach the possible upscaled saturation values are only above u 0 48 and u 0 31 for the staircase downwards and staircase upwards cases respectively fig 16 shows the micro scale solutions of the two cases together with the averaged and upscaled solutions using n 4 the upscaled solutions using both the original and shifted approaches are shown note that the solutions for staircase upwards and staircase downwards using the original approach are the same as they share the same effective fractional flow and effective diffusivity in the relevant range of u it is also clear from fig 16 that the shifted upscaling approach represents as expected a much better approximation of the averaged behavior of the staircase upwards case compared to the original approach the shifted approach leads to an overestimation of the plateau level near the inlet in the staircase downwards case hence for the staircase downwards example the original approach approximates the average behavior slightly better but both the original and shifted approach lead to fairly good representations of the average behavior in this case as seen in the curves for the effective fractional flow and effective diffusivity in figs 14 and 15 and in the corresponding averaged and upscaled solutions in fig 16 the internal distribution of the layers is not irrelevant in particular for the shifted approach the lowest possible value of upscaled saturation is u 0 48 for the staircase downwards case while the lowest for the staircase upwards case is u 0 31 as seen in fig 15 for the original approach the lowest upscaled saturation is u 0 45 in both the cases fig 14 this is reflected also in fig 16 where these plateau values are approached near the inlet in the upscaled solutions the averaged saturation of the staircase upwards case is approaching a plateau value similar to as predicted by the shifted upscaling approach while the averaged saturation of the staircase downwards case approaches a plateau value slightly below both upscaling approaches but closer to the original approach the staircase downwards case is hence not as limited in its averaged transport as predicted by the upscaled equations the amount of trapping in the staircase downwards case is overestimated by both approaches a possible way to improve the upscaling approach for such a transport would be to better incorporate the behavior between the low permeability and the next high permeability block between the cells the non monotone behavior discussed earlier where fluid would propagate partly into a new cell but do not cross completely as seen in figs 14 and 15 indicates that the staircase downwards case should indeed be more mobile than currently predicted by the upscaled approaches however the upscaled quantities below u 0 45 or u 0 48 are now never relevant 5 3 6 randomly distributed blocks finally we investigate the case of randomly distributed blocks as described in section 4 we consider two different layers with porosity ϕ 0 5 and ϕ 0 57 and permeability k 0 2 and k 0 4 the width of each layer is randomly chosen for simplicity we keep the grid on the micro scale uniform and the random width is chosen to be a multiple of the chosen grid size this ensures that the same discretization as described in section 5 1 can be directly applied to ease the comparison with the averaged and upscaled solutions the upscaled solution is chosen to have a grid such that each macro scale grid cell corresponds to two micro scale blocks since the blocks have a random width the upscaled eq 4 16 with corresponding flux function 4 18 and diffusivity 4 19 is discretized on a non uniform grid as described in section 5 2 note that the averaged and upscaled saturations represent the averages weighted with respect to porosity and layer width as seen in 4 15 in order to realize a random distribution of the blocks we choose δ x 1 512 and pick for each micro scale block a random number from a uniform distribution of integers between 4 and 12 the lower limit is set to 4 to ensure the presence of at least four grid points in each layer while the upper could be set to any number larger than 4 the last block has been adjusted in size such that the domain is x 0 2 the applied realization resulted in 124 blocks where the width of each block can be seen in fig 17 here we also show the macro scale grid size for each of the 62 macro scale grid cells the micro scale solution together with the averaged and upscaled solutions at time t 0 4 are shown in fig 18 the micro scale solution shows a qualitative similar behavior as e g in fig 9 although with a clear visible effect from the varying layer width the upscaled and averaged solutions are not behaving monotone anymore which is due to the averages being weighted with the layer width as well as the porosity hence when a high porosity and high permeability layer is wide the average over the two blocks will also be larger the averaged and upscaled solutions are however still behaving very similar to each other showing that the upscaled solution can still give a very good representation of the averaged behavior also in the case of randomly distributed blocks 6 final remarks we have derived an upscaled approach for two phase flow through highly heterogeneous media where both permeability and porosity can vary substantially the upscaling procedure applies to periodically or randomly distributed heterogeneities and where these heterogeneities can have any internal distributions compared to earlier approaches accounting for porosity differences in the model gives new conditions for the capillary pressure determining the overall flow and also affects the internal distribution of the fluid and hence the local trapping of the fluid the inclusion of several blocks that are periodically repeated with different internal distributions in the block properties opens for the consideration of local trapping in different ways in particular we are able to observe behavior with respect to trapping that would not have been visible for when only averaging over two periodically repeated layers or when considering a constant porosity the upscaled fractional flow function and effective diffusion depend both on the permeability and porosity values of the internal blocks but also of their internal distribution as the ordering of high permeability versus low permeability and likewise porosity blocks affects the effective flow and diffusivity behavior especially the location of the lowest permeability and porosity values compared to its neighbors is important for the overall flow to better account for the extreme case where the flow is limited by a transition from a high to a low permeability block a shifted upscaling approach was found to better represent the average behavior in such scenarios the upscaling has been generalized to be valid for averaging over any n number of periodally repeated layers but also to random layers where both porosity and permeability are randomly distributed the upscaled solution for the randomly distributed blocks was found to still give a very good representation of the average behavior showing the applicability of the upscaling procedure also in more general cases it should however be stressed that the considered models are applicable for moderate capillary numbers the upscaling approach we have presented here for one dimensional porous media represents a necessary basis for later extensions to two or three spatial dimensions with the current development we have derived a novel approach that allows the upscaling of trapping effects based on differences in the fractional flow and capillary effects through varying material properties credit authorship contribution statement tufan ghosh

appendix a upscaled equations for n sub layers within a cell here we present briefly the generalization of the results presented in section 3 3 in following we demonstrate the effective flow

capillary pressure we adopt a similar relation as in a 3 this means that whenever oil is present on either side of all the interfaces the first term in the expansion 3 8 is constant in the entire

again we consider a stationary ergodic geometrical structure which is characterized by a probability space ω μ along with ergodic dynamical systems t j x j 1 2 n 1 x r now for a μ measurable subset p

now b 6 ϕ ϵ x ω ϕ t x ϵ ω and k ϵ x ω k t x ϵ ω following similar steps as in section 4 one can derive the effective equations for n randomly distributed sub layers in a cell when there are randomly

1 ψ j ϕ i j u n i j j 1 n 1 ψ j ϕ i j 1 j 1 n 1 ψ j ϕ i n u 1 1 for u 1 with similar arguments as in the periodic case one can also define the effective capillary pressure and the effective diffusivity following the eqs a 7 and a 8 respectively note that for n sub layers in a cell the periodic case corresponds to ψ j 1 n for all j 1 2 n 1 hence for each realization ω we end up with an effective equation similar to the periodic case eq a 2 in addition one may observe that for ψ j 1 n for all j 1 2 n 1 the average oil saturation relation b 7 reduces to the relation a 1 which is the average oil saturation for the periodic case moreover similar observation also holds for other upscaled quantities 
393,in this article we consider a two phase flow model in a highly heterogeneous porous column the porous column consists of homogeneous blocks where the porosity and permeability vary from one block to the other the flow direction is perpendicular to the layering of the porous column and hence can be approximated by one dimensional model equations the periodic change in porosity and absolute permeability enforce the fluid to be trapped at the interface between the blocks leading to a highly varying saturation in order to capture the effective behavior upscaled equations for the average saturation are derived via homogenization this technique relies on a notion of periodicity and allows averaging over any number of blocks that may have any internal distributions of the rock parameters moreover the present article also derives effective equations for randomly distributed layers of different porosity and absolute permeability numerical experiments are performed which show good agreement between the averaged solutions of the original micro scale equations and the solutions of the upscaled equations also in the case of randomly distributed layers in particular these numerical experiments show how the internal distribution of the permeability and porosity affect the effective behavior of the flow keywords homogenization upscaling heterogeneous medium two phase flow 1 introduction multi phase flow through highly heterogeneous porous medium is encountered in various natural systems for example co2 sequestration in subsurface flow oil natural gas transport inside petroleum reservoirs groundwater networks etc generally these natural systems are spatially heterogeneous and range from small scale to large scale formations a typical heterogeneity stems from the composition of two homogeneous materials separated by a sharp interface where this transition is non smooth understanding the effect of such a sharp interface on the movement of these phases is an important topic and has drawn the attention of the research community in the last few decades kueper et al 1989 experimentally studied the effect of the heterogeneities on two phase flow through porous structures van lingen 1998 carried out a laboratory experiment on a column of porous layers with periodically varying permeability it may be noted that in petroleum recovery process rock heterogeneities lead to counter productive results for example if the permeability of the reservoir formation is high from the injection well to the production well a large amount of oil is bypassed during the water drive due to the preferential flow paths this leads to a substantial reduction in the recovery rate on the other hand let us consider the case when the rock inhomogeneity is perpendicular or cross laminated to flow from the injection to the production well in this case during water drive oil phase trapping is encountered at the interface between high and low permeability regions and flow becomes stagnant this again causes reduction in the recovery rate fluid flow inside these cross laminated heterogenous structures are studied by kortekaas 1985 and by duijn et al 1995 in a similar framework dale et al 1997 studied a steady two phase flow in a heterogeneous medium a very common challenge in petroleum reservoir models is the effect of small scale heterogeneities which significantly impact the large scale behavior of flow through the reservoir formation specifically the reservoir characteristics like porosity intrinsic permeability relative permeability etc vary at a microscopic scale compared to the field scale in general these micro scale variations largely control the macro scale flow behavior in order to capture these micro scale variations one has to perform detailed simulations which are very expensive with respect to time and other resources hence one should look for upscaling these oscillatory quantities and obtain a macro model or an intermediate scale model that is more amenable to perform simulations thus it is necessary to derive effective equations and constitutive relationships which can further capture the influence of micro scale heterogeneities and effectively transfer them to the large scale modeling approach one may refer to wen and gómez hernández 1996 for a detailed overview of the upscaling techniques for absolute permeabilities in heterogeneous media a comparative investigation between various dynamic upscaling methods for two phase flow based on fluid potentials is presented in darman et al 2002 a wide range of literature is available on the upscaling of multi phase fluid flow through porous media volume averaging techniques and homogenization or two scale asymptotic expansion techniques are popular upscaling methods for multi phase flow through porous media whitaker 1986 used volume averaging techniques and developed a macroscopic model for stokes flow of two immiscible fluids through a medium consisting of a rigid solid skeleton whitaker 1994 and lasseux et al 1996 improved this process by transforming the closure problem to stokes like equations that can be solved to determine the permeability tensors later lasseux et al 2008 derived a macroscopic model through volume averaging techniques for inertial two phase fluid flow through homogeneous porous media in the context of two phase flow through heterogeneous permeable structures quintard and whitaker 1988 derived large scale transport equations using volume averaging they also developed a closure scheme which can theoretically determine the large scale permeability tensor along with the large scale capillary pressure quintard and whitaker 1990a used the method of volume averaging to capture the complexities of two phase flow in heterogeneous porous media and derived a macroscopic form of the momentum equations for two immiscible fluids along with the large scale permeability tensor and a dynamic large scale capillary pressure here the corresponding closure problem was expressed in terms of integro differential equations for each of the phases involving two permeability tensors continuing their work quintard and whitaker 1990b presented numerical experiments in a two region model of a stratified system based on local volume averaged equations and compared these with the theoretical results obtained from large scale averaging quintard and whitaker 1988 1990a in general volume averaging techniques provide the form of the upscaled equations but in order to determine the coefficients it must be supplemented with physical arguments and or associated data berryman 2005 through assuming periodicity explicit expressions for the coefficients in the upscaled equations can be obtained through homogenization one may refer davit et al 2013 for a comparative investigation between volume averaging with closure and formal periodic asymptotics based on multi scale expansions in this context a noteworthy upscaling method of considerable interest is the homogenization using two scale asymptotic expansion methods we refer to hornung 1997 cioranescu and donato 1999 and auriault et al 2009 for more details on the homogenization technique lewandowska et al 2004 and neuweiler and cirpka 2005 used a homogenization approach to derive upscaled quantities for unsaturated porous media flow mikelić 2000 presented a detailed note on homogenization theory and its application to infiltration through porous structures several researchers beliaev 2003 bourgeat and hidani 1995 yeh 2006 zijl and trykozko 2002 have relied on this homogenization approach and analyzed incompressible immiscible two phase flow through heterogeneous porous media through homogenization bourgeat and panfilov 1998 constructed a macro scale model for two phase flow in a dual porosity medium moreover they determined a capillary relaxation time the existing literature indicates that upscaled models have been exploited to address multi phase flow through layered porous media mouche et al 2010 developed such a model for the vertical migration of a co2 plume through a vertical column filled with a periodically layered porous medium since the configuration is vertical both capillarity and buoyancy are taken into account and semi explicit upscaled flux functions are proposed transport of immiscible compressible fluids such as water gas through porous media is discussed by amaziane et al 2010 there a weak formulation of a nonlinear parabolic equation for the non wetting phase pressure and a nonlinear degenerate parabolic diffusion convection equation for the wetting phase saturation is developed considering a rapidly oscillating porosity function and absolute permeability tensor a nonlinear homogenized problem is obtained it is noticed that a large variation in the porosities permeabilities and the capillary pressure curves significantly control the rate and extent of the oil trapping or the storage of supercritical co2 moreover analyzing the impact of block type heterogeneities on the oil trapping in the upscaling context is an important area of research in the field of petroleum extraction process accounting for the influence of the capillary and viscous forces virnovsky et al 2004 presented an upscaled model for steady state two phase flow in a heterogeneous medium with periodic structures they computed rate dependent relative permeabilities and effective capillary pressure for the above mentioned setup adopting two scale asymptotic expansion methods van duijn et al 2002 derived the effective flow equations for a layered media with flow orthogonal to the strata they also considered a medium consisting of multiple layers and with random properties hence upscaled equations are derived for periodically as well as randomly layered media where the random nature is treated as a stationary ergodic structure van duijn et al 2002 assumed continuity of the first order term in the asymptotic expansion of the oil saturation this has lead to enhanced diffusivity effect in the effective equations van duijn et al 2007 consequently assuming continuity of the first order terms in the asymptotic expansion of the capillary pressure van duijn et al 2007 derived the effective quantities which are the weighted harmonic mean of the micro scale properties and these are different from the ones derived by van duijn et al 2002 the differences in the effective quantities are mainly in terms of the weights in this article we adopt a similar approach as in van duijn et al 2007 schweizer 2008 presented a convergence proof of the homogenization procedure for the setting used in van duijn et al 2002 2007 more precisely schweizer 2008 proved the weak convergence of the multi scale saturation and flux towards their effective counterparts however without hinting to the explicit form only the structure of the effective quantities are provided for the upscaled models schweizer and pop 2007 have shown that the effective models derived in van duijn et al 2007 and schweizer 2008 are equivalent using the concept of weighted solutions henning et al 2013 derived a rigorous homogenization result for degenerate two phase flow in a porous medium szymkiewicz et al 2011 proposed a macroscopic model for two phase flow accounting the trapping effects in a heterogeneous porous medium composed of disconnected inclusions embedded in the background material later szymkiewicz et al 2012 extended the previous study of szymkiewicz et al 2011 with two specific objectives i pointing out the limitations of the richard s equation for porous media with disconnected coarse inclusions ii accounting for the effect of apparent air entry pressure due to heterogeneous structures deriving an upscaled form of the modified richard s equation in the context of unsaturated porous media flow szymkiewicz et al 2014 have shown that the performance of the richard s equation can be improved by introducing appropriately defined effective permeability and capillary pressure functions representing large scale behavior of the heterogeneous medium bertsch et al 2003 analyzed the existence uniqueness and the regularity properties along with the matching conditions at the interface between the two types of rock with different permeabilities a generic model for capillary entrapment together with the convergence study of a numerical scheme of industrial interest is presented by enchery et al 2006 using an appropriate regularization and time discretization buzzi et al 2009 showed the existence for degenerate two phase flow equations in one space dimension for a simplified model of two phase flow the influence of discontinuous capillary forces at the interfaces between several rock types is investigated by cances 2010 ahmadi et al 2010 relied on numerical simulations to analyze the generalized darcy forchheimer model for two phase flow in a heterogeneous porous medium ern et al 2010 presented a sequential discontinuous galerkin method to approximate the trapping effects for two phase flow through heterogeneous porous media with capillary pressure discontinuity recently van duijn et al 2016 studied a two phase flow in heterogeneous porous media with dynamic capillarity effects the medium that they considered was composed of two adjacent homogeneous blocks with a sharp interface and they consequently derived the coupling conditions at the sharp transition face it is noticed that in most of the existing literature heterogeneity is mainly due to different permeabilities in the adjacent layers only a few researchers have treated heterogeneities due to both porosity and absolute permeability moreover the majority of the available studies in upscaling deals with a single discontinuity in the unit cell models allowing multiple types of heterogeneities and hence averaging over several discontinuities in the unit cell expected to better describe the average behavior in a highly heterogeneous reservoir on a fairly coarse grid we address such models in the current work here in this paper we generalize the problem considered by van duijn et al 2002 2007 which deals with the trapping phenomena at the micro scale we adopt homogenization techniques and two scale asymptotic expansion methods to derive the effective equations and the corresponding constitutive relations we consider only the capillary limit case i e capillary number is of order one in the dimensionless form physically we are interested in a situation when the capillary effects due to surface tension are balanced with the viscous effects the present study can not be thought of just as a simple generalization of van duijn et al 2002 2007 as the current work derives effective equations in two different configurations i cell containing a single discontinuity and ii cell containing multiple discontinuities we allow porosity and intrinsic permeability to vary on the micro scale we demonstrate the convergence through numerical examples further this study considers a variety of orientations for distribution of the porosity and permeability layers in addition this article derives upscaled equations for randomly distributed layers of different porosity and absolute permeability this study also briefly presents upscaled quantities for any number of discontinuities within a unit cell although we consider upscaling of a one dimensional model understanding the complex behavior for this setting is important for extending to two or three dimensions which will be taken up in future in section 2 we present the mathematical model for two phase flow through heterogeneous porous media section 3 deals with the derivation of the upscaled equations for highly heterogeneous porous structures effective quantities for a single discontinuity within a cell can be found in section 3 2 and extended results for multiple discontinuities within a cell are shown in section 3 3 section 4 deals with the derivation of effective equations for randomly distributed blocks a brief discussion on the numerical discretization of the micro scale and the upscaled equations are in section 5 1 and 5 2 respectively various numerical test cases are presented in section 5 3 with the final remarks in section 6 we conclude this article 2 mathematical formulation this section deals with the mathematical formulation of a specific two phase flow model the model is defined on a highly heterogeneous porous structure the highly heterogeneous porous medium consists of homogeneous layers with different porosity and absolute permeability these layers are perpendicular to the flow direction leading to a one dimensional flow and a medium with different coarse and fine layers refer fig 1 here we assume that the porosity ϕ x as well as absolute intrinsic permeability k x are varying between the layers note that the porosity and intrinsic permeability are assumed to be constant inside each layer hence here we analyze the one dimensional flow of two incompressible and immiscible phases through a medium with homogeneous layers of any porosity and intrinsic permeability zones throughout this investigation water is being considered as the wetting fluid and oil as the non wetting fluid the governing equations are the mass conservation 2 1 ϕ x s α t q α x 0 with α w n w and the multi phase extended darcy law with x axis along the flow direction 2 2 q α k x k r α s α μ α p α x the system is closed with the constraints on phase saturation and capillary pressure as 2 3 s w s n w 1 2 4 p n w p w p c x s w here ϕ k s μ kr p and q denote the porosity the intrinsic absolute permeability the saturation mapped to the standard interval 0 1 the viscosity the relative permeability the phase pressure and the specific discharge respectively with subscripts for each of the phases the capillary pressure is described by the widely used leverett model leverett 1941 2 5 p c x s w σ ϕ x k x j s w where σ and j are respectively the interfacial tension between the two fluids and the leverett function it is assumed that j is strictly decreasing going to infinity as sw 0 and that j 1 0 physically this indicates that the pressure difference in the two phases should exceed the capillary entry pressure given by p c x 1 σ ϕ x k x j 1 before the oil phase can penetrate into a fully water saturated core it may be noted that the entry pressure is inversely proportional to the square root of the absolute permeability and directly related to the square root of porosity and therefore varies between the layers thus the entry pressure will be discontinuous at the interface separating the two layers the mass conservation eq 2 1 together with the saturation constraint 2 3 implies that the total specific discharge darcy s velocity q q w q n w is constant in space i e q x 0 for the sake of simplicity we assume that the total specific discharge is constant with time as well hence one can choose q 0 as a prescribed quantity i e the flow takes place from left to right following van duijn et al 2002 2007 we set u s n w and consequently s w 1 u this eventually prompts us to redefine the functional form of k r α with α w n w pc and j in terms of u now j becomes strictly increasing with u and approaches to infinity as u 1 and j 0 0 taking into account the constant nature of the total darcy velocity specific discharge one can combine eqs 2 1 2 2 and conditions 2 3 2 4 into a single transport equation for the oil saturation consequently the saturation equation for the oil phase in terms of the new variable u can be written as 2 6 ϕ x u t x k r n w k r n w m k r w q k x μ w k r n w k r w k r n w m k r w p c x 0 note that in the leverett model of capillary pressure eq 2 5 an explicit relation between the capillary pressure porosity and absolute permeability of the medium is prescribed this expresses the saturation eq 2 6 precisely in terms of these discontinuous quantities of interest i e porosity and absolute permeability which in turn enable us to effectively capture the impact of these quantities in the formal derivation of the effective equations introducing the non dimensional variables as 2 7 x x l t t q l k k k where l is a macroscopic characteristic length scale and k is the characteristic absolute permeability for notational convenience we drop the hats in the rest of this study in this way we bring eq 2 6 to a dimensionless form as 2 8 ϕ x u t f x 0 with 2 9 f f u n c k x k r w u f u x p c x u here 2 10 f u k r n w k r n w m k r w is the fractional flow function and 2 11 p c x u ϕ x k x j u is the dimensionless capillary pressure the capillary number nc and the viscosity ratio m are defined as follows 2 12 n c σ k μ w q l m μ o μ w one must note that based on the specific application the value of the capillary number nc may vary considerably the jumps in the porosity ϕ and intrinsic permeability k produce discontinuities in the capillary pressure hence across the interfaces the spatial derivatives in eqs 2 8 and 2 9 need a special attention to deal with this complexity duijn et al 1995 bertsch et al 2003 have suggested to consider eq 2 8 only in the homogeneous layers with constant ϕ and k and to enforce matching conditions across the discontinuities specifically we assume that the discontinuity interface is located at x x i for given ϕ and k the matching conditions read for all t 0 2 13 f t x i 0 2 14 u x i t p c t x i 0 p c t x i 0 where f t x i f x i t f x i t is the jump in the flux at the interface xi and p c t x i likewise condition 2 13 expresses the flux continuity from condition 2 14 the capillary pressure is continuous p c t x i 0 only if the oil phase is present on the both sides of the interface u x i t 0 on the other hand the capillary pressure is discontinuous across the interface p c t x i 0 if the oil phase disappears for x xi i e u x i t 0 to complete the model suitable initial and boundary conditions are also needed as the upscaling procedure is independent of these they will be specified in section 5 it may be noted that bertsch et al 2003 studied a simplified version of the problem considered in this article with only one trap location they have shown the existence and uniqueness of a solution satisfying the standard porous media equation with regularity away from the trap location in addition they also established that the solution is bounded in the present article we assume similar properties for the oil saturation in the case of arbitrarily distributed multiple traps in particular 0 u 1 we mention that bourgeat and panfilov 1998 investigates a similar problem as considered here although using a phase pressure saturation formulation for the two phase flow and not the fractional flow formulation as applied here where we apply continuity of flux and capillary pressure if u x i t 0 they apply continuity of the fluxes in each phase and of the pressure in each phase and hence also of the capillary pressure at the discontinuity in this present article we investigate the trapping phenomena in highly heterogeneous media in this context it may be noted that the capillary entry pressure has a significant impact on the trapping phenomena van duijn et al 2007 hence to incorporate the effect of the capillary entry pressure in this current setting it is necessary to assume that the capillary pressure is continuous only when oil phase is present on the either side of the discontinuity otherwise a jump in the capillary pressure is noticed at the interface moreover in their non dimensionalization they open for the permeability ratio and the ratio of characteristic capillary pressure values to also depend on the scale separation ϵ l l which is not considered here 3 homogenization technique for periodic layers here in this section we derive effective upscaled two phase flow equations for periodically distributed layers corresponding to the model equations introduced in the earlier section the present study includes the differences in entry pressure corresponding to the different homogeneous layers which is eventually the main reason for trapping at the micro scale 3 1 homogenization procedure in order to derive an effective upscaled model we make use of the homogenization technique hornung 1997 we refer to the model equations as described in section 2 the highly heterogeneous nature of the medium considered stems from the varying porosity ϕj and absolute permeability kj as depicted in fig 1 each of the homogeneous layers is of thickness l micro scale reference length which is very small compared to the macro scale reference length l naturally this leads to a small expansion parameter ϵ l l 1 one may note that the trapping effects are prominent in all the transitions from a high permeability to a low permeability region one may note the presence of two dimensionless numbers m and nc in the dimensionless eq 2 8 through the flux 2 9 van duijn et al 2002 analyzed the problem separately for the two specific cases of small and moderate capillary number nc while keeping the viscosity ratio m 1 in their investigation convergence results for balance case i e n c o ϵ are shown using numerical examples whereas these numerical evidences are really difficult to attain in the case of the capillary limit i e n c o 1 until the capillary effects are dominant this restriction is due to the micro scale assumption of continuity of the o ϵ term in the asymptotic expansion of the oil saturation later with a different micro scale assumption concerning the continuity of the o ϵ term in the asymptotic expansion of the capillary pressure van duijn et al 2007 investigated the capillary limit case and consequently derived the macro scale equations which are also suitable for flow regimes that are not dominated by capillary effects here we follow a similar approach as described in van duijn et al 2007 in this present investigation we look only at the capillary limit case and derive the corresponding effective equations for a highly heterogeneous porous structure one can now proceed with the derivation of the upscaled effective equations for ϵ 0 using the well known two scale or homogenization technique here we assume that all the quantities depend on the two spatial variables x the macro scale or slow variable and y x ϵ the micro scale or fast variable based on these two variables one may expand all the quantities involved in terms of ϵ and equate the similar order terms in ϵ here we proceed with the derivation of the effective upscaled equations with two sub cases namely i single discontinuity within a cell and ii multiple discontinuities within a cell details are presented in the forthcoming subsections 3 2 single discontinuity within a cell for notational convenience we assume that the periodic structures with traps are located at the points x i ϵ y i ϵ i i z refer fig 2 the corresponding permeability k ϵ x and the porosity ϕ ϵ x are defined by k ϵ x k x ϵ and ϕ ϵ x ϕ x ϵ where 3 1 k k i 1 on y 2 i y 2 i 1 k i 2 on y 2 i 1 y 2 i 2 3 2 ϕ ϕ i 1 on y 2 i y 2 i 1 ϕ i 2 on y 2 i 1 y 2 i 2 we distinguish two kinds of matching conditions one going from k i 1 to k i 2 and the other from k i 2 to k i 1 1 at x 2 i 1 ϵ we impose the following a for k i 1 k i 2 3 3a if u 2 i 1 ϵ u 2 i 1 then u 2 i 1 ϵ 0 if u 2 i 1 ϵ u 2 i 1 then ϕ i 1 k i 1 j u 2 i 1 ϵ ϕ i 2 k i 2 j u 2 i 1 ϵ b for k i 1 k i 2 3 3b if u 2 i 1 ϵ u 2 i 1 then ϕ i 2 k i 2 j u 2 i 1 ϵ ϕ i 1 k i 1 j u 2 i 1 ϵ if u 2 i 1 ϵ u 2 i 1 then u 2 i 1 ϵ 0 where u 2 i 1 ϵ lim x 2 i 1 ϵ u x u 2 i 1 ϵ lim x 2 i 1 ϵ u x and u 2 i 1 is the threshold entry point saturation for fluid to flow through the interface x 2 i 1 ϵ which has to be exceeded before the non wetting oil phase can enter the fine material low permeability region from the coarse material high permeability region this threshold saturation is uniquely defined as a if k i 1 k i 2 then 3 4a ϕ i 1 k i 1 j u 2 i 1 ϕ i 2 k i 2 j 0 b if k i 1 k i 2 then 3 4b ϕ i 1 k i 1 j 0 ϕ i 2 k i 2 j u 2 i 1 at x 2 i 2 ϵ we impose a similar matching condition as that of 3 3 depending on the criterion either k i 2 k i 1 1 or k i 2 k i 1 1 as a for k i 2 k i 1 1 3 5a if u 2 i 2 ϵ u 2 i 2 then u 2 i 2 ϵ 0 if u 2 i 2 ϵ u 2 i 2 then ϕ i 2 k i 2 j u 2 i 2 ϵ ϕ i 1 1 k i 1 1 j u 2 i 2 ϵ b for k i 2 k i 1 1 3 5b if u 2 i 2 ϵ u 2 i 2 then ϕ i 1 1 k i 1 1 j u 2 i 2 ϵ ϕ i 2 k i 2 j u 2 i 2 ϵ if u 2 i 2 ϵ u 2 i 2 then u 2 i 2 ϵ 0 where u 2 i 2 is the threshold entry point saturation for fluid to flow through the interface x 2 i 2 ϵ this is similarly defined as u 2 i 1 in eq 3 4 we now replace ϕ and k by ϕ ϵ and k ϵ in 2 8 and 2 9 now eqs 2 8 and 2 9 hold in the domain σ ϵ r t ϵ where t ϵ ϵ i z i let u ϵ be a solution of 2 8 satisfying the matching conditions 3 3 and 3 5 we consider the following two scale asymptotic expansion 3 6 u ϵ x t u 0 x y t ϵ u 1 x y t ϵ 2 u 2 x y t where the functions uj are periodic in y x ϵ the fast scale this assumption is the counterpart of the stationarity condition in a random medium for the two scale asymptotic expansion method of homogenization since the microstructure is periodic here the property is stronger i e each uj is y periodic auriault et al 2009 it is noted that the continuity of the first order term in the asymptotic expansion of oil saturation eq 3 6 at the interface between two homogeneous layers used in van duijn et al 2002 leads to enhanced diffusivity in the resulting upscaled equation van duijn et al 2007 moreover this also produces discontinuities of order ϵ in the capillary pressure however although these are at the micro scale they result in a significant effect at the macro scale van duijn et al 2007 these observations prompts us to adopt the approach proposed in van duijn et al 2007 i e the continuity of first order terms in the expansion of the capillary pressure the averaged solution of the micro scale model is compared with the effective solutions developed in van duijn et al 2002 2007 the averaged solution is found to be better represented by the effective solution developed in van duijn et al 2007 to proceed with the derivation of the upscaled model one may notice that the capillary pressure can be expanded asymptotically as 3 7 p c u ϵ ϕ x k x j u ϵ ϕ x k x j u 0 j u u u 0 δ u 2 j u u 2 u 0 δ u 2 with δ u ϵ u 1 ϵ 2 u 2 this becomes 3 8 p c u ϵ ϕ x k x j u 0 ϵ u 1 j u 0 o ϵ 2 the first two terms in the pc expansion are 3 9 p c 0 ϕ x k x j u 0 3 10 p c 1 ϕ x k x u 1 j u 0 it may be noted that the expansion 3 7 is admissible only when j u and its higher order partial derivatives exist and are continuous at u 0 substituting these expansions into 2 8 and equating the terms of the same order of ϵ gives equations for u 0 u 1 at different orders of ϵ the details follow we define the effective oil saturation as 3 11 u x t y 2 i y 2 i 2 ϕ y u 0 x y t d y y 2 i y 2 i 2 ϕ y d y which is the weak limit of u ϵ and where u 0 x y t is the leading order approximation to u ϵ in some norm schweizer 2008 proved the convergence of the homogenization procedure for nonlinear flow problems in inhomogeneous geometries which is similar to the setting considered in this present article capillary limit n c o 1 introducing the oil flux as 3 12 f ϵ f u ϵ n c k ϵ x λ u ϵ p c ϵ x where 3 13 λ u ϵ k r w u ϵ f u ϵ and p c ϵ ϕ ϵ x k ϵ x j u ϵ eq 2 8 becomes 3 14 ϕ ϵ x u ϵ t f ϵ x 0 in σ ϵ 0 we now apply expansions 3 6 and 3 8 to f ϵ which gives 3 15 f ϵ ϵ 1 n c k λ u 0 p c 0 y f u 0 n c k λ u 0 p c 1 y p c 0 x λ u 0 u 1 p c 0 y ϵ f u 0 u 1 n c k λ u 0 p c 2 y p c 1 x λ u 0 u 1 p c 1 y p c 0 x λ u 0 u 1 2 2 λ u 0 u 2 p c 0 y o ϵ 2 equivalently we define 3 16 f ϵ ϵ 1 f 0 f 1 ϵ f 2 o ϵ 2 using the expansion 3 15 in the eq 3 14 leads to the following equations 3 17 o ϵ 2 0 f 0 y n c y k λ u 0 p c 0 y now incorporating the continuity of f ϵ we have 3 18 n c k λ u 0 p c 0 y f 0 f 0 x t which holds for every x y r and for all t 0 this is due to the continuity of the flux moreover we also have the following 3 19 o ϵ 1 0 f 0 x f 1 y x ϵ 1 n c k λ u 0 p c 0 y y f u 0 n c k λ u 0 p c 1 y p c 0 x λ u 0 u 1 p c 0 y 3 20 o ϵ 0 0 ϕ y u 0 t f 1 x f 2 y ϕ y u 0 t x f u 0 n c k λ u 0 p c 1 y p c 0 x λ u

3 5 with x and t as given parameters our aim is now to prove that f 0 0 let f 0 0 define 3 21 w y j u 0 y λ w k r w j 1 w f j 1 w and 3 22 λ w j 0 w λ s d s note that the last function is strictly increasing and from eq 3 18 we have 3 23 λ w ϕ k w y f 0 n c f 0 hence for y 2 i y y 2 i 1 3 24 λ w y 2 i 1 λ w y 2 i f ϕ i 1 k i 1 giving 3 25 w y 2 i 1 w y 2 i f ϕ i 1 k i 1 ϵ λ where λ denotes the standard sup norm defined by λ sup λ u 0 u 1 similarly for y 2 i 1 y y 2 i 2 3 26 w y 2 i 2 w y 2 i 1 f ϕ i 2 k i 2 ϵ λ where y 2i y 2 i 1 and y 2 i 2 are the location of the interfaces at the micro scale let us first consider the case k i 1 k i 2 assuming w y 2 i 1 j u 2 i 1 and using the strict monotonicity of w we get w y 2 i j u 2 i 1 giving w y 2 i j 0 this eventually contradicts the monotonic behaviour of w in y 2 i 1 y 2 i now assuming w y 2 i 1 j u 2 i 1 and the continuity of capillary pressure implies w y 2 i 1 ϕ i 1 k i 2 ϕ i 2 k i 1 w y 2 i 1 consequently from the relations 3 25 and 3 26 we have 3 27 w y 2 i 2 ϕ i 1 k i 2 ϕ i 2 k i 1 w y 2 i 1 f ϕ i 2 k i 2 ϵ λ ϕ i 1 k i 2 ϕ i 2 k i 1 w y 2 i f ϕ i 2 ϵ λ k i 2 k i 1 1 k i 2 repetition of this reasoning backwards in i shows that w will drop below j u 2 i 1 at the right half of a certain transition face which again leads to a contradiction hence f 0 0 similar arguments imply f 0 0 and hence f 0 0 now consider the case k i 1 k i 2 note that in this analysis flow direction is from left to right here in this case flow is from a low permeable medium to a relatively high permeable medium i e capillary pressure in the right portion of the transition face is lower than the same in the left side if the non wetting phase is present on both sides whereas in this scenario zero non wetting phase saturation in the right part eventually implies zero non wetting phase saturation in the left part as well hence in this case it is trivial that f 0 0 this conclusion allows us to solve eq 3 18 with the matching conditions 3 3 and 3 5 it may be noted that at the interface between the two homogeneous layers fluxes are continuous at all scales in addition to this the capillary pressure condition is also imposed at the interface and the periodicity is assumed at the end points of the cells these are satisfied only if u 0 is the lowest term in the asymptotic expansion 3 6 and is constant at the micro scale in the homogeneous layers in particular ci and c i are related by 3 28 c i j 1 ϕ i 1 k i 1 k i 2 ϕ i 2 j c i where ci and c i are the values of u 0 at the micro scale in the left and right part of the interface located at y 2 i 1 respectively now whenever c i 0 we find 3 29 u 0 y c i u 2 i 1 for y 2 i y y 2 i 1 c i for y 2 i 1 y y 2 i 2 if ci exceeds the threshold saturation u 2 i 1 and the non wetting phase can infiltrate into the immediate fine material or 3 30 u 0 y c i u 2 i 1 for y 2 i y y 2 i 1 0 for y 2 i 1 y y 2 i 2 if there is no non wetting phase flow from the high into the low permeable medium note that in the first case the capillary pressure is continuous at the transition face now consider the ϵ 1 eq 3 19 since f 0 0 and the flux is continuous we obtain f 1 f 1 x t using 3 29 and 3 30 the local form of f 1 is 3 31 f 1 f c i n c k i 1 λ c i p c 1 y p c 0 c i x for y 2 i y y 2 i 1 and 3 32 f 1 f c i n c k i 2 λ c i p c 1 y p c 0 c i x for c i u 2 i 1 0 for c i u 2 i 1 for y 2 i 1 y y 2 i 2 clearly one has to consider only the nontrivial case c i u 2 i 1 from 3 31 and 3 32 we obtain 3 33 p c 1 y f c i f 1 n c k i 1 λ c i p c 0 c i x b 1 x t for y 2 i y y 2 i 1 f c i f 1 n c k i 2 λ c i p c 0 c i x b 2 x t for y 2 i 1 y y 2 i 2 it is noted that after the integration b 1 b 2 0 thus one can solve for f 1 and obtain 3 34 f 1 1 k i 1 k r w c i 1 k i 2 k r w c i 1 k i 1 k r w c i f c i 1 k i 2 k r w c i f c i n c p c 0 c i x p c 0 c i x 1 k i 1 λ c i 1 k i 2 λ c i finally we use the ϵ0 eq 3 20 since f 2 is continuous in the fast scale we find the averaged oil saturation from eq 3 11 as 3 35 u x t y 2 i y 2 i 2 ϕ y u 0 x y t d y y 2 i y 2 i 2 ϕ y d y ϕ i 1 c i ϕ i 2 c i ϕ i 1 ϕ i 2 and the effective equation has the following form 3 36 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 2 2 u t x f u n c λ u x p c u 0 the effective saturation is expressed in terms of ci and c i for c i 0 we end up with the relation given in 3 28 this gives 3 37 u g c i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 2 ϕ i 1 c i ϕ i 2 j 1 ϕ i 1 k i 1 k i 2 ϕ i 2 j c i notice that g defined above maps 0 1 onto ϕ i 1 u 2 i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 2 1 as j is strictly increasing the function g shares the same property and can therefore be inverted hence one can write ci in terms of u as 3 38 c i g 1 u inserting the above into 3 28 one can obtain an equivalent expression for c i with the above expressions one can identify the upscaled fractional flow as 3 39 f u 0 for 0 u ϕ i 1 u 2 i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 2 1 k i 1 k r w c i 1 k i 2 k r w c i 1 k i 1 k r w c i f c i 1 k i 2 k r w c i f c i for ϕ i 1 u 2 i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 2 u 1 1 for u 1 this function can be interpreted as the weighted harmonic mean of the micro scale fractional flow the weight functions 1 k i 1 k r w c i and 1 k i 2 k r w c i depend on the water relative permeability which in turn depends on ci and c i the upscaled λ term is the harmonic average of the terms k i 1 λ c i and k i 2 λ c i 3 40 λ u 0 for 0 u ϕ i 1 u 2 i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 2 2 1 k i 1 λ c i 1 k i 2 λ c i for ϕ i 1 u 2 i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 2 u 1 0 for u 1 to express the upscaled capillary pressure we use 3 28 this means that whenever oil is present on both sides of the interface the first term in the expansion 3 8 is constant in the entire micro scale cell hence we get 3 41 p c u ϕ i 1 k i 1 j c i ϕ i 2 k i 2 j c i to determine the effective diffusivity d we use 3 38 3 40 and 3 41 which implies 3 42 d u λ u p c u where p c

going from k i 1 to k i 2 a second from k i 2 to k i 3 another from k i 3 to k i 4 and finally from k i 4 to k i 1 1 note that we impose matching conditions similar to eqs 3 3 and 3 5 at the locations x 4 i 1 ϵ x 4 i 2 ϵ x 4 i 3 ϵ and x 4 i 4 ϵ it may be noted that the unit cell construction used in fig 3 is referred to as the original or non shifted approach in the rest of this article from eq 3 23 with similar arguments as before one can prove that f 0 0 this conclusion allows us to solve eq 3 18 with the matching conditions similar to eqs 3 3 and 3 5 in the case of a single transition within a cell fluid can pass through the cell whenever it exceeds the threshold saturation at that transition face however for multiple transitions within a cell fluid can pass through the cell only if it exceeds the maximum threshold saturation of the transition faces otherwise fluid flow may cease at any of the transition faces having higher threshold saturation in this context we find different possibilities as follows 3 45 u 0 y c i 1 u 4 i 1 for y 4 i y y 4 i 1 c i 2 u 4 i 2 for y 4 i 1 y y 4 i 2 c i 3 u 4 i 3 for y 4 i 2 y y 4 i 3 c i 4 for y 4 i 3 y y 4 i 4 where 3 46a c i 2 j

u 4 i 3 respectively and the non wetting phase can infiltrate into the next fine material on the other hand if c i 1 c i 2 exceeds the threshold saturations u 4 i 1 u 4 i 2 respectively but c i 3 stays below or equal to u 4 i 3 and the non wetting phase can not infiltrate into the next fine material at the fourth compartment block of the cell i e y 4 i 3 y y 4 i 4 then 3 47 u 0 y c i 1 u 4 i 1 for y 4 i y y 4 i 1 c i 2 u 4 i 2 for y 4 i 1 y y 4 i 2 c i 3 u 4 i 3 for y 4 i 2 y y 4 i 3 0 for y 4 i 3 y y 4 i 4 further if c i 1 exceeds the threshold saturation u 4 i 1 but c i 2 stays below or equal to u 4 i 2 and the non wetting phase can not infiltrate into the next fine material at the third compartment of the cell i e y 4 i 2 y y 4 i 3 and consequently in the fourth compartment then 3 48 u 0 y c i 1 u 4 i 1 for y 4 i y y 4 i 1 c i 2 u 4 i 2 for y 4 i 1 y y 4 i 2 0 for y 4 i 2 y y 4 i 3 0 for y 4 i 3 y y 4 i 4 finally if c i 1 stays below or equal to u 4 i 1 and the non wetting phase can not infiltrate into the next fine material at the second compartment of the cell i e y 4 i 1 y y 4 i 2 and also the consequent compartments then we have 3 49 u 0 y c i 1 u 4 i 1 for y 4 i y y 4 i 1 0 for y 4 i 1 y y 4 i 2 0 for y 4 i 2 y y 4 i 3 0 for y 4 i 3 y y 4 i 4 note that in the first case the capillary pressure is continuous at all the transition faces in the second case the capillary pressure is continuous at the first two transition faces further in the third case the capillary pressure is only continuous at the first transition face whereas in the fourth case the capillary pressure is discontinuous at all the transition faces here in this subsection we will only point out the differences between the single discontinuity case and the multiple discontinuities case for the effective equations for all the necessary steps in the derivation we refer to the previous subsection and also to van duijn et al 2007 for multiple transitions within a cell we define the averaged oil saturation as 3 50 u x t y 4 i y 4 i 4 ϕ y u 0 x y t d y y 4 i y 4 i 4 ϕ y d y ϕ i 1 c i 1 ϕ i 2 c i 2 ϕ i 3 c i 3 ϕ i 4 c i 4 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 2 ϕ i 3 ϕ i 4 and the corresponding effective equation is given by 3 51 j 1 4 ϕ i j 4 u t x f u n c λ u x p c u 0 the effective saturation is expressed in terms of c i j j 1 2 3 4 fluid can pass through the cell only if c i j 0 j hence we consider c i j 0 to derive the upscaled quantities next for c i j 0 j 2 3 4 we end up with the relations given in 3 46 this gives 3 52 u g c i 1 1 j 1 4 ϕ i j ϕ i 1 c i 1 ϕ i 2 j 1 ϕ i 1 k i 1 k i 2 ϕ

function g shares the same property and can therefore be inverted hence one can write c i 1 in terms of u as 3 53 c i 1 g 1 u inserting the above into 3 46 one can obtain equivalent expressions for c i j j 2 3 4 note that fluid flow can be ceased at any of the transition faces unless it exceeds the corresponding threshold saturation hence it can pass through any of the transitions including the entire cell considering this and with the above expressions one can identify the upscaled fractional flow as 3 54 f u 0 for 0 u ϕ i 1 u 4 i 1 j 1 4 ϕ i j j 1 2 1 k i j k r w c i j j 1 2 1 k i j k r w

interpreted as the weighted harmonic mean of the micro scale fractional flow the weight functions 1 k i j k r w c i j j 1 2 3 4 depend on the water relative permeability which eventually depend on c i j j 1 2 3 4 note that the harmonic means in 3 54 are only over the layers for which fluid could enter this is to illustrate the potential effect that fluid could enter partly into a macroscopic grid cell with several layers but not completely through for example if the saturation is such that fluid can enter the first two blocks but is too low to proceed to the third one would be in the second case of 3 54 note however that it would not be possible for the flow to pass through the entire cell in this case the upscaled λ term is the harmonic average of the terms k i j λ c i j j 1 2 3 4 3 55

case of partial intrusion second and third case but we note that there would not be any diffusion across the macro scale block to express the upscaled capillary pressure we use 3 46 this means that whenever oil is present on both sides of all the interfaces the first term in the expansion 3 8 is constant in the entire micro scale cell hence we get 3 56 p c u ϕ i 1 k i 1 j c i 1 ϕ i 2 k i 2 j c i

that when the permeability in k i 4 last compartment block of ith cell is much larger than k i 1 1 first compartment block of i 1 th cell the choice of the above cell as in fig 3 may not be a good periodic structure for the upscaling procedure since the threshold saturation value at the micro scale location y 4 i 4 controls significantly the flow transitions from the ith to i 1 th cell in this context we consider a shifted periodic structure refer fig 4 for a medium with a staircase upwards type porosity and intrinsic permeability distribution refer fig 5 please note that the upscaled quantities can be derived in a similar way as earlier here in the following we only hint the deviations in the local reconstruction of the flow quantities for notational convenience we assume that the periodic structures with traps are located at the points x i ϵ y i ϵ i i z the corresponding permeability k ϵ x and the porosity ϕ ϵ x are defined by k ϵ x k x ϵ and ϕ ϵ x ϕ x ϵ where 3 58 k k i 1 on

distinguish four kinds of matching conditions one going from k i 1 to k i 2 other from k i 2 to k i 3 other from k i 3 to k i 4 and another from k i 4 to k i 1 1 note that we impose matching

original approach we find 3 60 u 0 y c i 1 u 4 i 1 for y 4 i 1 2 y y 4 i 1 c i 2 u 4 i 2 for y 4 i 1 y y 4 i 2 c i 3 u 4 i 3 for y 4 i 2 y y 4 i 3 c i 4 u 4 i 4 for y 4 i 3 y y 4 i 4 c i 5 for y 4 i 4

wetting phase can infiltrate into the next fine material we also have other possibilities analogous to the original approach given in eqs 3 47 3 49 however to compute the effective quantities we require c i j 0 j hence these alternatives are not relevant and to avoid repetitions we skip these expressions now in the case of the shifted approach for multiple transitions within a cell we define

distributed blocks in this section we derive effective equations for a random distribution of blocks refer to fig 6 in the capillary limit here we present the derivation for the cell with a single discontinuity and for multiple discontinuities we refer to appendix b the derivation steps are similar to the approach explained by van duijn et al 2002 and are thus only explained briefly however here we assume the continuity of the first order term in the asymptotic expansion of the capillary pressure instead of the oil saturation that is used in van duijn et al 2002 we give more attention to the differences between the approach of van duijn et al 2002 and what is followed here in this study we consider a stationary ergodic geometrical structure instead of a periodic distribution of blocks a stationary ergodic structure is a stochastic structure that exhibits both stationarity and ergodicity essentially this implies that the random structure will not change its statistical properties with time and that its statistical properties can be deduced from a single sufficiently large random sample of the process daley and vere jones 1988 papanicolaou 1995 it is assumed that the stationary ergodic structure is characterized by a probability space ω μ along with an ergodic dynamical system t x x r papanicolaou 1995 van duijn et al 2002 now for a μ measurable subset p ω we introduce p p ω r by 4 1 p ω x r t x ω p which is a random stationary set in this case we assume that p ω is of the form 4 2 p ω i z y 2 i y 2 i 1 in which y i r are strictly increasing random variables with respect to i according to the ergodic theorem of birkhoff 1931 there exists a density function of p given by 4 3 ψ μ p lim a b 1 y 2 b y 2 a a b y 2 i 1 ω y 2 i ω for nearly all ω ω satisfying 0 ψ 1 the corresponding random porosity and absolute permeability is given by 4 4 ϕ x i ω ϕ t x i ω ϕ i 1 if x i p ϕ i 2 if x i r p 4 5 k x i ω k t x i ω k i 1 if x i p k i 2 if x i r p note that porosity ϕ and absolute permeability k are stationary random variables now 4 6 ϕ ϵ x ω ϕ t x ϵ ω and k ϵ x ω k t x ϵ ω consequently u i u i ω through the relation 3 4 this being stochastic we use the two scale asymptotic expansion for the saturation capillary pressure and flux function given by relation 3 6 3 7 and 3 16 respectively note that here fj are stationary ergodic random fields using these expansions in eq 3 14 we get 4 7 f 0 y 0 f 0 f 0 x t while the random variable p c 0 satisfies the eq 3 18 now for a given realization of ω one needs to reconsider this eq 3 18 following analogous steps as van duijn et al 2002 and as in the periodic layer case it follows that f 0 0 now for i z 4 8 u 0 y ω c i ω u 2 i 1 ω for y 2 i ω y y 2 i 1 ω c i ω j 1 ϕ i 1 k i 1 k i 2 ϕ i 2 j c i ω for y 2

for y 2 i 1 ω y y 2 i 2 ω if there is no non wetting phase flow from high to low permeable medium note that in the first case capillary pressure is continuous at the transition face now consider the o ϵ 1 eq 3 19 as f 0 0 the ergodic nature of f 1 suggests that f 1 f 1 x t and given by 4 10 f 1 f u 0 n c k i ω λ u 0 p c 1 y p c 0 x let c i ω u 2 i 1 ω then f 1 0 on y 2 i ω y 2 i 1 ω implies f 1 0 x r and t 0 next if c i ω u 2 i 1 ω then 4 11 p c 1 y f c i ω f 1 n c k i 1 ω λ c i ω p c 0 c i ω x b 1 ω for y 2 i ω y y 2 i 1 ω f c i ω f 1 n c k i 2 ω λ c i ω p c 0 c i ω x b 2 ω for y 2 i 1 ω y y 2 i 2 ω it may be noted that van duijn et al 2002 has the local representation for u 1 y however in this article we have the same for p c 1 y this is due to the differences in the micro scale assumption between van duijn et al 2002 and the present study since p c 1 y is the local representation of a stationary random variable with zero mean we get 4 12 χ 1 b 1 ω χ 2 b 2 ω 0 where χ is the characteristic function now eq 4 12 gives 4 13 ψ f c i ω f 1 n c k i 1 ω λ c i ω 1 ψ f c i ω f 1 n c k i 2 ω λ c i ω ψ p c 0 c i ω x 1 ψ p c 0 c i ω x eq 4 13 can be solved for f 1 and we obtain dropping ω dependency for convenience 4 14 f 1 ψ k i 1 k r w c i 1 ψ k i 2 k r w c i ψ k i 1 k r w c i f c i 1 ψ k i 2 k r w c i f c i n c ψ p c 0 c i x 1 ψ p c 0 c i x ψ k i 1 λ c i 1 ψ k i 2 λ c i finally we use the o ϵ 0 eq 3 20 using the ergodic nature of f 2 we find the averaged oil saturation from eq 3 11 as 4 15 u x t y 2 i y 2 i 2 ϕ y u 0 x y t d y y 2 i y 2 i 2 ϕ y d y ψ ϕ i 1 c i 1 ψ ϕ

c i ω 0 we have 4 17 u g c i ω 1 ψ ϕ i 1 1 ψ ϕ i 2 ψ ϕ i 1 c i ω 1 ψ ϕ i 2 j 1 ϕ i 1 k i 1 k i 2 ϕ i 2 j c i ω note that g defined above maps 0 1 onto ψ ϕ i 1 u 2 i 1 ψ ϕ i 1 1 ψ ϕ i 2 1 we use similar arguments to write ci ω in terms of u as in eq 3 38 with the above expressions one can identify the effective upscaled fractional flow as 4 18 f u 0 for 0 u ψ ϕ i 1 u 2 i 1 ψ ϕ i 1 1 ψ ϕ i 2 ψ

harmonic mean of the micro scale fractional flow function as in the periodic layer case here we mention that the difference in the effective fractional flow in van duijn et al 2002 compared to the present study is in terms of the weights a straightforward mathematical calculation shows that the weights in van duijn et al 2002 are ψ k i 1 k r w c i j c i and 1 ψ k i 2 k r w c i j c i we refer to appendix b for the functional form of the effective fractional flow in case of multiple discontinuities in addition the effective upscaled λ term is also the harmonic average of the micro scale quantities hence given by 4 19 λ u 0 for 0 u ψ ϕ i 1 u 2 i 1 ψ ϕ i 1 1 ψ ϕ i 2 1 ψ k i 1 λ c i 1 ψ k i 2 λ c i for ψ ϕ i 1 u 2 i 1 ψ ϕ i 1 1 ψ ϕ i 2 u 1 0 for u 1 for the effective λ term in case of multiple discontinuities refer to appendix b with similar arguments as in the periodic case one can also define the effective capillary pressure and the effective diffusivity following the eqs 3 41 and 3 42 respectively note that for a single discontinuity in a cell the periodic case corresponds to ψ 1 2 hence for each realization ω we end up with an effective equation similar to the periodic case eq 3 36 in addition one may observe that for ψ 1 2 the average oil saturation relation 4 15 reduces to the relation 3 35 which is the average oil saturation for the periodic case 5 comparison between micro scale and upscaled model we here compare the original micro scale eq 2 8 and the upscaled equation for periodic layers 3 36 or 3 51 with special emphasis on showing the differences with respect to the upscaled equation developed in van duijn et al 2007 we first describe the numerical implementation of the equations before moving to the numerical examples for all the numerical examples we let n c 1 and consider the following brooks corey type relative permeabilities and leverett type capillary pressure 5 1 k r w u 1 u 2 k r n w u 2 j u 1 u 1 2 in van duijn et al 2007 2002 the porosity was always constant and our model reduces to the model found in van duijn et al 2007 when the porosity is set as constant and averaging over two blocks hence the model of van duijn et al 2007 can be seen as a special case of the model derived in the current paper when allowing porosity to vary with the permeability we will in most of the numerical examples assume a kozeny carman like relation between the non dimensional permeability and porosity that is 5 2 k ϕ ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 γ with a material constant γ 2 5 however note that the considered models and the upscaling procedure in the previous sections do not rely on such a relation between porosity and permeability and is mainly applied for convenience for all the simulations we consider the initial condition 5 3 u t 0 0 9999 and u t 0 0 9999 for the micro scale and the upscaled equations respectively the reason for not using an initial value of 1 is to avoid the singularity of the capillary pressure 5 1 the corresponding boundary conditions over the domain x 0 2 are 5 4 u x 0 0 and u x x 2 0 and correspondingly for the upscaled saturation u 5 1 numerical discretization of the micro scale equation implementing the original eqs 2 8 is a non trivial task due to the discontinuities appearing at the transitions between the permeability layers the main steps follow the approach developed and applied by van duijn et al 2002 2007 hence we explain these only in brief we give more attention to the differences between the numerical approach of van duijn et al 2002 and the current one the micro scale eq 2 8 will be discretized with a cell centered two point finite volume scheme using upwinding for the spatial discretization and forward euler for the time discretization such an approach has proven successful in previous applications as by van duijn et al 2002 2007 and is analyzed by evje and karlsen 2000 dealing with the fluxes at the transitions between the layers is of high importance to correctly capture the trapping and to get an accurate numerical approximation therefore we adopt a similar strategy here as applied by van duijn et al 2002 2007 however similar considerations to incorporate capillary pressure conditions and entry pressure effects are also taken into account by ern et al 2010 henning et al 2013 duijn et al 1995 van duijn et al 2016 discretizations with such modified flux calculations are also investigated analytically by brenner et al 2013 enchery et al 2006 henning et al 2015 jaffré 1995 we mention that although the choice of explicit time discretization gives a time step restriction the explicit time discretization also makes each time step much cheaper as fewer nonlinear problems have to be solved the domain x 0 2 is divided into uniform grid cells where we use more grid cells than number of discontinuities and where grid cell j is the interval x x j 1 2 x j 1 2 j j 1 δ x and δx is the grid size the cell center xj is hence located in j 1 2 δ x for the time discretization we use forward euler with a constant time step δt the flow is always from left to right and we apply upwinding for the advective flux we let u j k denote the discrete unknown in grid cell j at time step k the grid size is such that a discontinuity in permeability porosity always occurs on a grid edge we first describe the discretization away from the discontinuities before explaining the procedure for correctly incorporating the discontinuities on the transitions discontinuities are found in both permeability k x and in porosity ϕ x but these are assumed to occur at the same locations hence for an interior unknown u j k 1 away from a discontinuity in permeability and porosity we have 5 5 u j k 1 u j k δ t δ x ϕ j f j 1 2 k f j 1 2 k where f j 1 2 k is the approximation of the flux function 2 9 on the edges x j 1 2 similarly as van duijn et al 2002 and evje and karlsen 2000 we apply a kirchhoff transformation to the capillary pressure term in 2 9 we define 5 6 β u 0 u k r w v f v j v d v where β u is now a strictly increasing function in u and smooth for our choices of krw u krnw u and j u the flux function 2 9 can then be approximated as 5 7 f j 1 2 k f u j k n c ϕ j k j β u j 1 k β u j k δ x where ϕj and kj are the constant porosity and permeability found in grid cell j when there is a discontinuity in porosity and permeability on the cell edge x j 1 2 we have to modify the corresponding approximation of the flux f j 1 2 k to this aim we use a similar approach as van duijn et al 2002 but include also the effect of the varying porosity in this case the permeability and porosity values in grid cells j and j 1 are different and are denoted by kj k j 1 and ϕj ϕ j 1 to determine the correct flux on x j 1 2 we apply the capillary pressure conditions as described in 3 3 we introduce dummy variables u j k and u j k representing the saturation just left and right of the edge x j 1 2 respectively as in van duijn et al 2002 we separate between transitions from low to high or from high to low permeability to calculate u j k and to modify the fluxes following the capillary pressure conditions 3 3 we have a if k j k j 1 then 5 8a if u j k u j then u j k 0 if u j k u j then ϕ j k j j u j k ϕ j 1 k j 1 j u j k b if k j k j 1 then 5 8b if u j k u j then ϕ j 1 k j 1 j u j k ϕ j k j j u j k if u j k u j then u j k 0 where u j is the threshold saturation associated with the edge x j 1 2 defined similarly as 3 4 the flux f j 1 2 k is modified using values only from the left or the right side of the edge x j 1 2 that is 5 9a f j 1 2 k f u j k n c k j ϕ j β u j k β u j k δ x 2 5 9b f j 1 2 k f u j k n c k j 1 ϕ j 1 β u j 1 k β u j k δ x 2 from the assumptions on u j k these two fluxes have to be equal since u j k is known we reformulate 5 9 together with 5 8 as equations for determining u j k we are searching for the zero of the function 5 10 g u j k u j k δ x 2 f u j k n c k j 1 ϕ j 1 β u j k n c k j ϕ j β u j k t where t is given by 5 11 t δ x 2 f u j k n c k j 1 ϕ j 1 β u j 1 k n c k j ϕ j β u j k note that g u j k u j k is a strictly increasing function in both arguments we assume that a cfl condition is fulfilled such that t δ x 2 n c k j ϕ j k j 1 ϕ j 1 β 1 to incorporate the capillary pressure conditions we separate between four cases corresponding to 5 8 we emphasize that van duijn et al 2002 describes the same cases with respect to shifts in permeability but uses different bounds on t than considered in the following first assume k j k j 1 and that t n c ϕ j k j β u j in this case the function g u j k 0 has a unique zero in the interval u j k 0 u j it hence follows that u j k 0 and the first pressure condition in 5 8a is fulfilled secondly if k j k j 1 and n c ϕ j k j β u j t the only possibility for g u j k u j k to reach zero is for a non zero u j k and u j k u j and we are in the second case of 5 8a we hence search for the unique solution u j k u j 1 and u j k j 1 ϕ j k j 1 k j ϕ j 1 j u j k 0 fulfilling g u j k u j k 0 similarly when k j k j 1 and t δ x 2 f u j n c ϕ j 1 k j 1 β u j the function g 0 u j k has a unique zero in the interval u j k 0 u j in this case u j k 0 fulfilling the second pressure condition in 5 8b finally if k j k j 1 and δ x 2 f u j n c ϕ j 1 k j 1 β u j t the function g u j k u j k has a unique zero fulfilling u j k u j 1 and u j k j 1 ϕ j 1 k j k j 1 ϕ j j u j k 0 although van duijn et al 2002 considered the same cases as here with constant ϕ with the corresponding reasoning they use the opposite cases for t giving unique solutions for when k j k j 1 and k j k j 1 the bounds given by van duijn et al 2002 cannot yield unique solutions for u j k and u j k under their conditions it seems that they simply switched the cases k j k j 1 and k j k j 1 while describing the bounds we could only reproduce their simulation results when using the cases for t as described here these four cases cover the conditions in 5 8 and enable us to determine the modified fluxes 5 9 on edges x j 1 2 where the permeability and porosity is discontinuous any of the two expressions in 5 9 can be applied in 5 5 as they are equal the values for u j k have to be updated for every time step but depend only on information from the previous known time step to ensure that the saturation remains within the physical bounds 0 and up to 1 we get a time step restriction in 5 5 following arguments by evje and karlsen 2000 we get for 5 5 that 5 12 δ t δ x max u 0 1 f u 2 n c δ x max x 0 2 ϕ x k x max u 0 1 β u min x 0 2 ϕ x guarantees a solution within these bounds as long the initial condition fulfills these for a domain with many discontinuities in the permeability and porosity a very small grid size δx will be needed which will also pose severe restrictions on the time step δt for example for δ x 1 512 n c 1 m 1 ϕ varying between 0 5 and 0 66 and maximum k being 1 we get δ t 9 10 6 the simulations in section 5 3 are made with a time step fulfilling 5 12 hence the saturations are expected to remain within 0 1 as proven by pop and yong 2002 although we use the initial condition 5 3 which is below 1 we could in theory have that the saturation in the first time steps increases to saturation values very close to 1 near the layer transitions which would lead to numerical difficulties this was however not the case for the examples considered in the current study where only a small increase related to the machine precision was encountered 5 2 numerical discretization of the upscaled equations the upscaled eqs 3 36 3 51 and 4 16 are also discretized using a cell centered finite volume scheme although the upscaled solution represents the case where the number of layers have approached infinity we will generally use the same number of grid points for the upscaled solution as there are layers divided by the number of layers we average over in this case the upscaled solution has the same number of grid points as the averaged micro scale solution giving a fair comparison between the two solutions hence if considering a case with e g 16 layers with every second low and high permeabilities and porosities we would only apply 8 upscaled grid cells when considering the formulation from section 3 2 for 3 36 and 3 51 a uniform grid is applied each grid cell j is the interval x x j 1 2 x j 1 2 j j 1 δ x where δx is the grid size but where the grid size is now determined by the number of permeability and porosity layers and of how many are averaged over the cell center xj is located in j 1 2 δ x if there are n layers in total and we average over n layers where n n is an integer the discretization of the upscaled model hence has n n grid cells and δ x 2 n n but δx can also be chosen differently and in this case there is no connection between the number of grid points used for the upscaled solution and the actual number of layers for the randomly distributed blocks the upscaled eq 4 16 is discretized on a non uniform grid that reflects the widths of the underlying random layers that are averaged over here each grid cell j is the interval x x j 1 2 x j 1 2 where δ x j x j 1 2 x j 1 2 and the cell center xj is in x j x j 1 2 x j 1 2 2 the flow is always from left to right and we apply upwinding for the time discretization we use forward euler with a constant time step δt letting u j k denote the discrete unknown in grid cell j at time step k the upscaled eqs 3 36 3 51 or 4 16 is 5 13 u j k 1 u j k δ t δ x j ϕ j g j 1 2 k g j 1 2 k where g j 1 2 k is the approximation of the flux found in 3 36 3 51 or 4 16 and ϕ j is the average of the n porosities found in grid cell j this average is weighted with respect to the layer widths in the random case note that for 3 36 and 3 51 the grid size is constant the upscaled flux g is approximated by 5 14 g j 1 2 k f u j k n c λ j 1 2 k p c u j 1 k p c u j k δ x j 1 2 where λ j 1 2 k is the width weighted harmonic average of the λ u j 1 k and of λ u j k where λ u is given by 3 40 for n 2 by 3 55 or 3 65 for n 4 and by 4 19 for the randomly distributed blocks the upscaled fractional flow function f u is given by 3 39 for n 2 by 3 54 or 3 64 for n 4 and by 4 18 for the random blocks the averaged grid size δ x j 1 2 δ x j δ x j 1 2 is used in the case for the randomly distributed blocks 4 16 but is constant equal to δx for 3 36 and 3 51 to evaluate f u j k and λ u j k the local saturations have to be reconstructed for each layer found within grid cell j as explained in sections 3 2 3 3 and 4 the discontinuities between the layers are incorporated into the upscaled equations hence they do not require any special attention except to ensure that the local reconstruction remains within 0 1 hence 5 13 is applied for the entire domain similarly as with the discretization for the micro scale equations we get a bound on the time step size in 5 13 to ensure solutions remaining between 0 and up to 1 here we get 5 15 δ t δ x max u 0 1 f u 2 n c δ x max u 0 1 λ u p c u min x 0 2 ϕ x in the case of a non uniform grid the above bound should be fulfilled with respect to the smallest appearing grid size as the upscaled equations are in general solved on a much coarser mesh this constraint will not be a severe one for the numerical examples in the following section the upscaled equations are solved with the same time step as applied for the corresponding micro scale equations which always fulfilled the upscaled time step constraint 5 3 numerical examples we first assess the behavior of the micro scale and upscaled equations with respect to an increasing number of repeated layers and assess the effect of averaging over several layers as well as the number of grid points used further we compare our model to van duijn et al 2007 and show the differences that appear when letting the porosity vary before considering the effect of large permeability and porosity difference and viscosity ratio we then assess some interesting behavior when letting n 2 and finally we address a case with randomly distributed blocks the original non shifted approach is applied for the upscaled equations unless otherwise is stated unless otherwise stated we apply for the micro scale simulations n x 8 grid points within each layer and hence nx n grid points in total for n layers while for the upscaled equations we apply n n grid points 5 3 1 behavior with respect to number of grid points and averaging layers we let n denote the total number of layers between x 0 2 the permeability values are oscillating between 0 2 and 0 4 with corresponding porosity values of 0 5 and 0 57 we let the viscosity ratio be m 1 increasing n for the micro scale equations corresponds to layers becoming thinner and the medium acting more homogeneous fig 7 shows the average behavior of the micro scale equations black lines where the solution has been averaged over the two internal layers the micro scale simulations have here used a discretization with n x 8 grid points in each layer the average is a porosity weighted average to coincide with the averaging applied in the upscaling procedure in fig 7 we also show the convergence of the upscaled solution with respect to refining the grid as mentioned in section 5 2 the number of grid points for the upscaled equations can but does not have to represent the number of layers we here use n to denote the number of layers also for the upscaled equations since we always average over two layers this means n 2 grid points have been used this way the averaged and upscaled solutions with same n in fig 7 use the same number of grid points the purple lines are the results of the upscaled equations where we always average over two transitions hence n 2 the upscaled solution shows a small overestimate of the saturation values near the inlet as also observed in van duijn et al 2007 for constant porosities this overestimate is however decreasing with increasing n hence fig 7 shows how the increasing number of layers support a converging average behavior while increasing number of grid points for the upscaled equations also support convergence and that these two approaches converge towards the same averaged upscaled solution in the following we will always use n n grid points for the upscaled equations one can of course use a larger amount of grid points but this choice give a more fair comparison with the averaged solution as they then have the same number of grid points we now fix n 128 and assess the effect of averaging or upscaling over two or more internal layers the setting is the same as before with permeability values oscillating between 0 2 and 0 4 porosity between 0 5 and 0 57 and viscosity ratio is m 1 the original micro scale equations are solved for n 128 and with n x 8 grid points within each layer and the micro scale solution is averaged using porosity weighted averages over n 2 n 4 and n 8 layers also the upscaled equations are correspondingly solved for when averaging over n 2 n 4 and n 8 layers using n n grid points the results are seen in fig 8 note that when solving the n 8 upscaled equations only 16 macro scale grid points are used this gives a very cheap and fairly accurate discretization although the shape of the front is not captured so accurately due to a low amount of grid points however from fig 8 it is clear that all the upscaled approaches do a good job in approximating the average behavior of the micro scale equations as in fig 7 we see a slight overestimate of the upscaled solutions compared to the averaged micro scale solutions however this overestimate is less when only averaging over n 2 finally we assess the grid convergence of the micro scale equations we here fix n 96 layers and let nx be the number of grid points used within each layer fig 9 shows the micro scale solutions using n x 4 8 16 grid points within each layer the zoomed in view in the right part of fig 9 shows that n x 4 is deviating slightly from the other two near the block transitions while n x 8 and n x 16 give very similar results at the micro scale the averaged solutions are visually identical for all three cases with the averaged n x 4 solution lying slightly above the other two calculating the l2 norm of the difference between the two coarser solutions with the n x 16 solution gives 6 6 10 3 and 2 6 10 3 for n x 4 for the averaged and micro scale solution respectively and 2 2 10 3 and 9 1 10 4 for n x 8 the small difference between n x 8 and n x 16 both for the micro scale solution and the averaged solution indicates that the gain of increasing the number of grid points per layer is marginal we will hence use n x 8 grid points for each layer in all following numerical examples 5 3 2 constant versus varying porosity we now consider n 128 and let the permeability vary between k 0 2 and k 0 4 to compare with the model considered by van duijn et al 2007 we either let the porosity be constant or vary between ϕ 0 5 and ϕ 0 57 with the fine and coarse layers fig 10 shows the average of the micro scale equations and the upscaled equations n 2 for each of the two cases together with a zoomed in view of also the original micro scale solution since van duijn et al 2007 has incorporated the porosity into the non dimensionalization we calculate a corresponding non dimensional time for the varying porosity based on the average porosity the effect of varying porosity mainly affects the slope of the saturation front also the varying porosity gives a different internal distribution of the saturation between the fine and the coarse layers 5 3 3 effect of strong discontinuity between layers if increasing the permeability and porosity ratio between the repeating layers the effect is similar as observed in van duijn et al 2007 where the front becomes more steep we here apply repeating layers of permeability k 0 2 and k 1 while porosity correspondingly oscillates between ϕ 0 5 and ϕ 0 66 fig 11 shows the upscaled and averaged solution after t 0 1 t 0 3 and t 0 5 using n 128 and n 2 both for the averaged and upscaled solutions comparing to the solutions found with a smaller permeability and porosity difference in figs 8 and 10 we see that the averaged and upscaled solutions approach a higher plateau level as expected also the micro scale oscillations are much larger where substantially larger saturation values are found in the high porosity and permeability layers we consider now a larger permeability ratio and also explore a different relation between porosity and permeability than the kozeny carman relation 5 2 the repeating layers have a permeability of k 0 1 and k 1 while porosity either follows 5 2 giving ϕ 0 43 and ϕ 0 66 in the layers or we consider porosities of ϕ 0 2 and ϕ 0 8 in the layers to at the same time show how a larger porosity ratio affects the behavior the averaged and upscaled results at time t 0 25 using n 128 and n 2 are shown in fig 12 where the results marked kc corresponds to the porosity ratio following 5 2 while the results marked large have the larger porosity ratio compared to fig 11 we see that the plateau values of trapped oil near the inlet is even larger for both cases although the averaged and upscaled behavior of the kc and large cases are quite similar with only a minor difference in the front speed and the internal distribution of the micro scale solution is quite different the difference in front speed can be connected to the average porosity being different note that the averaged and upscaled solutions are based on porosity weighted averages in the case of a large porosity difference between the layers the larger saturations in the high porosity layers have a large impact on the averaged solution the increased porosity ratio between the layers makes the jump in the micro scale saturation between the layers smaller which was also observed in fig 10 5 3 4 effect of large viscosity ratio we also consider the viscosity ratio between the fluids being large namely m 5 and m 10 going back to the n 128 permeability and porosity layers of k 0 2 and k 0 4 and ϕ 0 5 and ϕ 0 57 as earlier and average over n 2 we obtain the averaged and upscaled solutions found in fig 13 the solutions are shown at the times t 0 1 t 0 25 and t 0 4 which approximately corresponds to the times of t 0 2 t 0 5 and t 0 8 considered in van duijn et al 2007 also when including varying porosity we see that the larger viscosity ratios lead to a more smooth front as capillary forces become more dominant and the front speed increases this is particularly more visible for m 10 the zoomed in view in the right part of fig 13 also shows how the increasing viscosity ratio allows more trapping of fluid near the inlet in both the high permeability and low permeability layers 5 3 5 four repeated layers we here design two test cases where four layers are repeated throughout the domain the four layers have increasingly finer coarser permeabilities and porosities and attain the values k i 1 0 2 k i 2 0 34 k i 3 0 58 k i 4 0 99 ϕ i 1 0 5 ϕ i 2 0 55 ϕ i 3 0 61 ϕ i 4 0 66 these values are periodically repeated through the domain and we consider two cases one where the internal distribution is a staircase upwards with stepwise increasing values as in the above equation and the other where the internal distribution is a staircase downwards where the permeabilities and porosities are stepwise decreasing oppositely as the above equation these two distributions represent the extreme cases that can be expected when there are four repeated values this is due to the fact that both include a step between the highest and lowest porosity and permeability values in particular for the staircase upwards case the step from the last high permeability layer to the first low permeability layer poses a severe restriction on the flow for this case the shifted upscaling approach is expected to better represent the average behavior the staircase downwards case has several minor steps that all limit the flow while the large step from the last low permeability layer to the first high permeability layer does not pose a restriction here both the upscaling approaches are expected to behave reasonably well although the permeability and porosity values are the same in these two cases the effective fractional flow functions and effective diffusivity are generally not the same when averaging over n 4 the reason is that the local reconstructions of the saturation values using 3 52 or 3 63 are different however if applying the original multi block averaging described in section 3 3 the effective diffusivity 3 57 and fractional flow 3 54 functions are the same for values larger than u 0 45 and they would both approach zero as u 0 45 this is due to only the internal transitions being properly accounted for especially for the staircase upwards case this is a crude approach as the transition from the last high permeability block into the first low permeability block in the next cell represents a large restriction on the flow in figs 14 and 15 the effective fractional flow 3 54 and 3 64 and diffusivity 3 57 and 3 67 using the original and shifted approach for the staircase upwards and downwards cases are shown as mentioned earlier the original approach gives curves that are similar to each other and they are identical for u 0 45 compared to the fractional flow and effective diffusivity found in e g van duijn et al 2007 we see a non monotone behavior for low values of u in the effective quantities in the staircase downwards case recall that the effective fractional flow 3 54 and 3 64 and diffusivity 3 57 and 3 67 are defined as the harmonic averages over the layers where fluid could enter this non monotone behavior is due to the fluid in this case would theoretically be able to enter the first high permeability block or two first blocks in the cell but not pass through the cell completely as the last block represents the largest restriction on the flow only the staircase downwards case includes such artifacts as the internal transitions pose restrictions on the flow while for the staircase upwards case the flow could infiltrate the entire layer when being able to enter the first low permeability layer however since we initially start with a large saturation which gradually decreases the effective saturation u will not reach values below u 0 45 or u 0 48 as the effective quantities do not allow any fluid movement then values below u 0 45 or u 0 48 correspond to at least one block those with lowest porosity and permeability having zero saturation this means that the non monotone behavior seen in the effective flux and diffusivity functions is not relevant as we will not be able to attain effective saturation values below 0 45 or 0 48 for the staircase downwards case we also see that for the shifted approach the possible upscaled saturation values are only above u 0 48 and u 0 31 for the staircase downwards and staircase upwards cases respectively fig 16 shows the micro scale solutions of the two cases together with the averaged and upscaled solutions using n 4 the upscaled solutions using both the original and shifted approaches are shown note that the solutions for staircase upwards and staircase downwards using the original approach are the same as they share the same effective fractional flow and effective diffusivity in the relevant range of u it is also clear from fig 16 that the shifted upscaling approach represents as expected a much better approximation of the averaged behavior of the staircase upwards case compared to the original approach the shifted approach leads to an overestimation of the plateau level near the inlet in the staircase downwards case hence for the staircase downwards example the original approach approximates the average behavior slightly better but both the original and shifted approach lead to fairly good representations of the average behavior in this case as seen in the curves for the effective fractional flow and effective diffusivity in figs 14 and 15 and in the corresponding averaged and upscaled solutions in fig 16 the internal distribution of the layers is not irrelevant in particular for the shifted approach the lowest possible value of upscaled saturation is u 0 48 for the staircase downwards case while the lowest for the staircase upwards case is u 0 31 as seen in fig 15 for the original approach the lowest upscaled saturation is u 0 45 in both the cases fig 14 this is reflected also in fig 16 where these plateau values are approached near the inlet in the upscaled solutions the averaged saturation of the staircase upwards case is approaching a plateau value similar to as predicted by the shifted upscaling approach while the averaged saturation of the staircase downwards case approaches a plateau value slightly below both upscaling approaches but closer to the original approach the staircase downwards case is hence not as limited in its averaged transport as predicted by the upscaled equations the amount of trapping in the staircase downwards case is overestimated by both approaches a possible way to improve the upscaling approach for such a transport would be to better incorporate the behavior between the low permeability and the next high permeability block between the cells the non monotone behavior discussed earlier where fluid would propagate partly into a new cell but do not cross completely as seen in figs 14 and 15 indicates that the staircase downwards case should indeed be more mobile than currently predicted by the upscaled approaches however the upscaled quantities below u 0 45 or u 0 48 are now never relevant 5 3 6 randomly distributed blocks finally we investigate the case of randomly distributed blocks as described in section 4 we consider two different layers with porosity ϕ 0 5 and ϕ 0 57 and permeability k 0 2 and k 0 4 the width of each layer is randomly chosen for simplicity we keep the grid on the micro scale uniform and the random width is chosen to be a multiple of the chosen grid size this ensures that the same discretization as described in section 5 1 can be directly applied to ease the comparison with the averaged and upscaled solutions the upscaled solution is chosen to have a grid such that each macro scale grid cell corresponds to two micro scale blocks since the blocks have a random width the upscaled eq 4 16 with corresponding flux function 4 18 and diffusivity 4 19 is discretized on a non uniform grid as described in section 5 2 note that the averaged and upscaled saturations represent the averages weighted with respect to porosity and layer width as seen in 4 15 in order to realize a random distribution of the blocks we choose δ x 1 512 and pick for each micro scale block a random number from a uniform distribution of integers between 4 and 12 the lower limit is set to 4 to ensure the presence of at least four grid points in each layer while the upper could be set to any number larger than 4 the last block has been adjusted in size such that the domain is x 0 2 the applied realization resulted in 124 blocks where the width of each block can be seen in fig 17 here we also show the macro scale grid size for each of the 62 macro scale grid cells the micro scale solution together with the averaged and upscaled solutions at time t 0 4 are shown in fig 18 the micro scale solution shows a qualitative similar behavior as e g in fig 9 although with a clear visible effect from the varying layer width the upscaled and averaged solutions are not behaving monotone anymore which is due to the averages being weighted with the layer width as well as the porosity hence when a high porosity and high permeability layer is wide the average over the two blocks will also be larger the averaged and upscaled solutions are however still behaving very similar to each other showing that the upscaled solution can still give a very good representation of the averaged behavior also in the case of randomly distributed blocks 6 final remarks we have derived an upscaled approach for two phase flow through highly heterogeneous media where both permeability and porosity can vary substantially the upscaling procedure applies to periodically or randomly distributed heterogeneities and where these heterogeneities can have any internal distributions compared to earlier approaches accounting for porosity differences in the model gives new conditions for the capillary pressure determining the overall flow and also affects the internal distribution of the fluid and hence the local trapping of the fluid the inclusion of several blocks that are periodically repeated with different internal distributions in the block properties opens for the consideration of local trapping in different ways in particular we are able to observe behavior with respect to trapping that would not have been visible for when only averaging over two periodically repeated layers or when considering a constant porosity the upscaled fractional flow function and effective diffusion depend both on the permeability and porosity values of the internal blocks but also of their internal distribution as the ordering of high permeability versus low permeability and likewise porosity blocks affects the effective flow and diffusivity behavior especially the location of the lowest permeability and porosity values compared to its neighbors is important for the overall flow to better account for the extreme case where the flow is limited by a transition from a high to a low permeability block a shifted upscaling approach was found to better represent the average behavior in such scenarios the upscaling has been generalized to be valid for averaging over any n number of periodally repeated layers but also to random layers where both porosity and permeability are randomly distributed the upscaled solution for the randomly distributed blocks was found to still give a very good representation of the average behavior showing the applicability of the upscaling procedure also in more general cases it should however be stressed that the considered models are applicable for moderate capillary numbers the upscaling approach we

capillary pressure we adopt a similar relation as in a 3 this means that whenever oil is present on either side of all the interfaces the first term in the expansion 3 8 is constant in the entire

where p c u ϕ i 1 k i 1 j g 1 u g g 1 u similarly one can obtain the effective flow quantities for the shifted approach in a cell with n sub layers appendix b upscaled equations for n randomly

again we consider a stationary ergodic geometrical structure which is characterized by a probability space ω μ along with ergodic dynamical systems t j x j 1 2 n 1 x r now for a μ measurable subset p

are strictly increasing random variables with respect to i using the ergodic theorem by birkhoff 1931 we get that there exists a density function of pj given by b 3 ψ j μ p j lim a b 1 y n b j 1 y n a

now b 6 ϕ ϵ x ω ϕ t x ϵ ω and k ϵ x ω k t x ϵ ω following similar steps as in section 4 one can derive the effective equations for n randomly distributed sub layers in a cell when there are randomly

diffusivity following the eqs a 7 and a 8 respectively note that for n sub layers in a cell the periodic case corresponds to ψ j 1 n for all j 1 2 n 1 hence for each realization ω we end up with an effective equation similar to the periodic case eq a 2 in addition one may observe that for ψ j 1 n for all j 1 2 n 1 the average oil saturation relation b 7 reduces to the relation a 1 which is the average oil saturation for the periodic case moreover similar observation also holds for other upscaled quantities 
394,understanding multiphase flow in porous media especially how velocity is distributed at the pore scale has been the aim of several studies however these studies address the recirculation behavior inside the trapped phase experimentally without any comprehensive numerical study of the impact of different governing mechanisms related to the fluid configurations and properties including drag force and capillary number analysis at low capillary number regime in this study we analyzed the recirculation phenomenon inside the trapped phase for various displacement mechanisms fluid configurations and dynamic properties to simulate the pore scale displacement at low capillary number we used a filtered surface force formulation of volume of fluid method which was implemented in a separately available solver for openfoam package the results showed that within the ranges of capillary number of invading phase analyzed in this study in the order of 1 10 7 to 1 10 2 the recirculation phenomenon exists in trapped phases during the imbibition mechanism two stagnant regions are created adjacent to the fluid fluid interface inside the invading fluid drag force analysis on fluid fluid interfaces shows that during imbibition the maximum force is exerted near the center of the interface whereas during drainage more force is applied on two elongated interface tails on a solid surface the centroids are elongated parallel to the interface during drainage and perpendicularly during imbibition which is in concordance with drag force distribution along with the interface the existence of a solid surface near the fluid fluid interface affects the recirculation process in a way that one or more centroids can be created depending on displacement mechanisms when the ratio of trapped phase radius to cavity depth is lower two simultaneous recirculation zones are formed inside the invading and trapped phases while the changes in viscosity ratio and interfacial tension shifted the centroid location inside the trapped zone the center of rotation seems to be independent of injection velocity the average velocity of trapped phase is individually a logarithmic function of the surface tension and fluids viscosity ratio the stationariness of centroid results in a linear relationship between the average velocity inside the trapped zone and injection velocity for all ranges of viscosity ratios a linear relationship between the capillary number of invading and trapped phase is obtained the findings of this study lead to a better understanding of trapping and

enhanced oil recovery zhao et al 2010 soil remediation aminnaji et al 2019 and carbon hydrogen storage ebigbo et al 2013 riazi et al 2011 various microscale forces including capillary viscous inertial and gravitational forces play an important role in fluid dynamics especially at the interface dejam et al 2014 ferrari and lunati 2014 2013 mashayekhizadeh et al 2011 méheust et al 2002 raeini et al 2014 the roles of rock and fluid properties that can significantly affect the displacement process are also important avraam and payatakes 1995 specifically pore scale investigation is a strong tool that can shed light on the subsurface process at the microscale to investigate the physics of fluid flow at pore scale 2d glass micromodels can be used in conjunction with fluorescence microscopy and micro particle image velocimetry micro piv to directly observe and measure the pore scale processes jiménez martínez et al 2017 roman et al 2016 2019 roman et al 2016 investigated the velocity profiles in two phase flow through the heterogeneous sandstone replica micromodel using micro piv the results depicted recirculation motion inside the immobile pockets of the wetting phase due to momentum transmitted by the flowing oil kazemifar et al 2016 reported shear induced circulation in trapped water ganglia during post front passage displacement of water by supercritical co2 in a homogenous micromodel in concordance with the kazemifar et al work li et al 2017 observed the shear induced circulation during post front passage flow in a heterogeneous micromodel for a supercritical co2 water system they determined co2 flow directions with the aim of circulation within the trapped water phase as it is very difficult to directly measure co2 flow using micro piv heshmati and piri 2018 observed the recirculation process in a pore doublet model in the viscous dominant regime they reported that the shear stress applied to the trapped non wetting phase was intensified as the viscous forces increased the effect of increasing injection velocity on the velocity of the non wetting phase was less noticeable indicating the presence of a slip boundary between the fluids zarikos et al 2018 analyzed the interaction of capillarity and momentum transfer between the two immiscible phases for different non wetting trapped globules with various sizes in contrast with stagnant areas where the viscous drag applied on the fluid fluid interface is negligible in nonzero velocity areas the momentum transfers cause circulations within the trapped phase the circulation velocity is maximum near the fluid fluid interface and an increase in capillary number of invading phase increases the circulation velocity as well as the shift in circulation centroid toward high velocity region similar to the circulation phenomenon process for trapped phases in porous media there are other two phase systems in which this process is noticeable bhaga and weber 1981 maxworthy et al 1996 the effect of capillary numbers slug size and viscosity ratios on internal recirculation within two phases in capillary channels have been investigated in several experimental kashid et al 2007 liu et al 2017 ma et al 2014 and numerical studies kashid et al 2005 sarrazin et al 2006 contrary to the recent studies where the velocity fields were observed in only one phase usually the water phase two phase flow can be explored using an appropriate two phase flow simulator pore network modeling as a low cost computational tool has advanced during recent years in both quasi static and dynamic modes blunt 2001 oren et al 1998 direct numerical simulation methods including smoothed particle hydrodynamic sph as a meshless method hirschler et al 2016 the lattice boltzmann method lbm kang et al 2002 and computational fluid dynamic methods cfd raeini et al 2012 can perform simulation at high resolution of the real structure of pore spaces fakhari et al 2018 using the lattice boltzmann model for the simulation of multiphase flows of water co2 systems in a micromodel observed the recirculating flows in the still flowing co2 phase as the impacts of inertial forces direct numerical simulation of pore scale processes by cfd methods have gained great prominence due to their ability to simulate fluid flow for wide density and viscosity ratio ranges meakin and tartakovsky 2009 in a recent study using direct numerical simulation the results of drainage processes in a 2d cavity showed better mixing processes and larger interfacial mass transfer in the presence of recirculation inside the cavity maes and soulaine 2018 shams et al 2018 analyzed the viscous coupling effects as a function of the viscosity ratio wettability and varying fluid configurations in circular capillary tubes raeini et al 2014 studied the snap off and layer flow to analyze the impact of geometry and flow rate on the hydraulic conductivity of disconnected ganglia using volume of fluid vof based finite volume method to consider interfacial tension various approaches can be applied to vof the continuous surface stress css method gueyffier et al 1999 the continuous surface force csf method brackbill et al 1992 and the sharp surface force ssf francois et al 2006 raeini et al 2012 in these approaches it is very difficult to predict flow at low capillary numbers where the capillary forces are dominant which can result in non physical velocity currents around the interface raeini et al 2014 to eliminate the non physical behavior from the numerical solution for the cases of capillary forces dominancy the filtered surface force fsf is introduced raeini et al 2012 specifically the capillary pressure dynamic pressure gradients and viscous and inertial forces are separately calculated to prevent introducing instabilities in the numerical equations it is shown that the spurious current is minimum around the interface when the fsf is used pavuluri et al 2018 the concept and application of the recirculation phenomenon are of great importance especially for processes contending with mass transport kazemifar et al 2016 li et al 2017 maes and soulaine 2018 recently some research has been carried out to investigate this phenomenon in both experimental roman et al 2016 zarikos et al 2018 and numerical approaches fakhari et al 2018 maes and soulaine 2018 however they have not discussed the role of displacement mechanism and fluid configurations on the recirculation process also in the case of experimental investigations kazemifar et al 2016 roman et al 2016 2019 zarikos et al 2018 the velocity profile is only presented inside the trapped phase maes et al 2018 investigated the role of recirculation phenomena on the mass transfer process for various viscosity ratios however they did not consider the effects of injection velocity and surface tension as other dynamic parameters involved in the capillary number zarikos et al 2018 investigated how the center of circulation and average velocity of the trapped phase moved for various capillary numbers but they did not discuss the behavior of capillary number for various viscosity ratios this work sheds light on the recirculation process for both imbibition and drainage mechanisms for various fluid configurations at low capillary number also using drag force analysis on fluid fluid and fluid solid interfaces we comprehensively discuss the behavior of recirculation phenomena in addition we discuss the analysis of dynamic parameters including injection velocity viscosity ratio and surface tension individually on the behavior of recirculation we used the fsf formulation of the vof method implemented in porefoam separately available solver for openfoam to simulate two phase flow inside a 2d pore doublet model at low capillary number in this study we addressed the question of how recirculation behavior changes under various dynamic and static conditions as the multiphase flow simulation is carried out in the real structure of pore spaces this study is new to those that use simplified models such as pore network modeling also using the fsf formulation of the vof method minimizes the spurious currents introduced in numerical equations on the other hand the simulation run time is relatively long due to small time steps that should be used especially at low capillary numbers the main limitation is that even with this advanced method the simulation of fluid flow for the invading phase capillary numbers lower than 10 7 cannot be performed also because of high computational cost investigation of more complex porous media was not feasible the increase in mesh size and shortness of time steps might have led to a long simulation time the results of this work can be applied for cases where recirculation plays a pivotal role along with mass transfer such as co2 storage analyzing drag force on the fluid fluid interface is also important in processes where the balance of forces on the interface determines the mobilization or trapping of the droplet during enhanced oil recovery methods dejam and hassanzadeh 2018 olayiwola and dejam 2019 yang et al 2020 2019 fig 1 is a schematic of the problem statement this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the numerical method section 3 gives the model validation and verification section 4 discusses the results and finally section 5 summarizes the conclusions 2 numerical method 2 1 mathematical formulation this section described the mathematical model we used to solve two phase flow the navier stokes equation describes the dynamics of two immiscible incompressible flow since part of the solutions are interface dynamics a moving boundary problem is required batchelor and batchelor 2000 for an isothermal condition the momentum balance equation in terms of the viscous inertial capillary and gravity forces is written as raeini et al 2012 1 d d t ρ u t p d ρ g f c p c where u denotes the velocity field ρ the density t the time and g is gravity vector d d t ρ u is attributed to the inertial force which is responsible for the acceleration of fluid and momentum transfer caused by advection t μ u u μ is the viscous force ρ g is gravity force and f c is the capillary force pd is dynamic pressure and defined as pd p pc where the pc is capillary pressure term dynamic pressure is acquired from the mass balance equation in combination with the momentum balance equation considering incompressible flow 2 u 0 the capillary pressure term is calculated using the equation 3 p c f c with the boundary condition 4 p c n b 0 where nb is the axis normal to the boundary eqs 3 and 4 introduce a neumann problem for capillary pressure term which has a unique solution including the effect of the capillary force in navier stokes equations provides an opportunity to filter the instabilities introduced into the numerical equations where the capillary forces are high raeini et al 2012 at the fluid fluid interface the α value is between zero and one it is evolved with the advection equation of the form 5 α t α u 0 by solving eq 5 the indicator function is obtained then the capillary force fc can be calculated as a body force brackbill et al 1992 6 f c σ k n i δ s where σ is surface tension n i is the unit interface normal vector δ is the delta function active along the interface and k n i is the interface curvature and is normal to the interface 7 n i α α detailed forced filtered formulation of the volume of fluid method is discussed in appendix a 2 2 computational domain two phase flow simulations were performed in designed 2d pore doublets inspired by the heshmati and piri 2018 study on velocity fields and shear stress at fluid fluid interfaces in a controlled environment figure shows the 2d geometrical model used in this study the width of the inlet and outlet of the pore assembly was 120 µm and the model was 410 µm long this specific model enabled us to examine recirculation inside the trapped phases in various geometrical structures where dead ends and cavities were designed to resemble the likeliest zones in porous media for the trapping process the left and right sides of pore doublet models are cavities perpendicular to the main flow while in the left side a circular solid provides an opportunity to analyze the rotational flow in the vicinity of solid surfaces the bottom dead end is behind the main flow direction allowing investigation of the recirculation in a zone where the invading phase velocities are relatively low by subdividing the primary domain into non overlapping subdomains as smaller discrete cells flow eqs 1 7 and a1 a11 are solved the domain was meshed using openfoam meshing tools snappyhexmesh weller et al 1998 to visualize the processes we used paraview 2 3 fluid properties to analyze the role of displacement mechanisms on recirculation processes in various fluid configurations inside the pore assembly we considered a set of fluid properties listed in table 1 the properties were designed to ensure that enough shear stress was transmitted to the trapped phase in both drainage and imbibition mechanisms to examine the effects of dynamic parameters involving capillary number including surface tension velocity and viscosity ratio different ranges were considered and explained in that section as the bond number bo δρgl σ where l is the characteristic length is equal to zero due to the presence of fluids with the same densities the effect of gravitational forces is not a focus in this study 2 4 boundary and initial condition one of the essential physical parameters which should be defined in the numerical solver is suitable boundary conditions zero longitudinal velocity magnitude ux is considered while the imposition of uniform velocity profile equal to 1 0 10 4 m s supplies the latitudinal velocity uy at the inlet for outlet boundary zero gauge global pressure we considered a resemblance with atmospheric pressure inlet gradient pressure values and the velocity gradient at the outlet were fixed at zero during all simulations the grain surfaces predetermined wetting properties depending on the displacement mechanism i e fully wet to the invading phase in the case of imbibition and fully non wet to the invading phase in the case of drainage the normal velocity component at a fluid solid interface was set at zero no slip conditions to analyze the recirculation behavior inside the trapped phases in similar conditions the model was initially set to be filled with invading fluid then the trapped phase was locally patched at three individual locations on the right and left sides of the pore assembly and around the bottom dead end then the invading fluid with a certain contact angle depending on the displacement mechanism i e zero for imbibition and 180 for drainage was injected at the inlet 2 5 solution methodology for a time dependent approach for 2d simulations an open source finite volume cfd package was used the fsf formulation of the vof method raeini et al 2012 with pressure implicit split operator piso algorithms issa 1986 was a segregated procedure used to solve the pressure velocity and volume fraction coupling equations we used a semi implicit formulation of capillary forces to confirm the accuracy and stability of the numerical method adjustable time steps with a maximum courant number of 1 0 10 5 ferziger and perić 2002 were used the time steps were designed in a way to satisfy the constraints below raeini et al 2012 8 δ t c δ t μ δ x σ where δt is time step size δx is mesh resolution and c st is a constant varying depending on the formulation of capillary forces explicit or semi implicit raeini et al 2012 the simulations in this work were performed on intel core i9 5 ghz 16 mb cache with 16 processors and 16 gb ram 3 validation and verification 3 1 mesh independency the mesh density of the network is governed in a way that no dependency between the discretization and variable can be observed the openfoam snappyhexmesh utility was used for domain meshing this tool allows good refinement of grids in the various parts of a pore assembly the mesh quality was confirmed by analysis of grid refinement where numbers of mesh elements were increased gradually from 8800 to 79 000 corresponding to the number of cells in the narrowest throat from 9 to 11 13 and up to 23 the residuals average velocity and velocity distributions inside the sub domains were calculated in each simulation to confirm the grid size convergence the results showed that the simulation with 19 cells in the narrowest throat equivalent to a mesh size of 55 635 cells led to minimum error while the finer mesh did not decrease the error fig 3 illustrates the mesh inside the pore assembly 4 results this section considers the simulation results of two individual displacement mechanisms i e imbibition and drainage through the pore doublet model in both cases three patches of defending phase were trapped in the right and left sides of the pore doublet model as well as the bottom dead end this fluid configuration within the pore assembly not only facilitated the analysis of recirculation behavior in various arrangements to the flow direction but also provided the same conditions for both displacement mechanisms prior to any displacement simulation the trapped patches were relaxed for 0 03 s to remove the capillary oscillation effects from the numerical calculations during this process no inflow or outflow of the fluids across the boundaries was considered to make the interface reaching equilibrium configuration depending on the contact angle then the displacement process was simulated to reach the steady state condition depending on the displacement mechanism 4 1 model validation to ensure the accuracy of the numerical model the simulation results were validated with available experimental data mentioned in the study of heshmati and piri 2018 heshmati and piri 2018 they analyzed the recirculation process inside one side of a pore doublet model originally inspired by chatzis and dullien 1983 for immiscible displacement table 2 shows the values for velocities at 10 µm intervals to the liquid liquid interface inside invading and trapped phases our simulation results show that in a similar boundary and initial conditions to their experimental study a recirculation zone was created inside the non wetting trapped phase at the right side of pore assembly analysis of velocity distribution at both sides of liquid liquid interface shows that the velocities are in good agreement with the experiment due to the low quality of images in heshmati and piri 2018 we validated this process using other experimental data we used the experimental data related to a drainage process inside dead end pore micromodels i e eddy pockets roman et al 2019 to simulate the drainage mechanism eddy pockets including three connected cavities were considered fig 4 a then with the same boundary and initial conditions to their experimental study the non wetting phase was injected through the micromodel to avoid the borders effect the central cavity results were selected to be compared with the experimental results a mesh sensitivity was performed and mesh size equal to 93 600 cells equivalent to cell size of 1 6 micron was selected as the optimum density as fig 4 b shows good agreement can be seen between the numerical simulation and experimental results especially in phase distributions and the velocity profile inside the cavity to better understand the velocity distribution inside the trapped phase the values of ux and uy along the vertical axis to the centroid dashed white line in fig 4 b c for the simulation process are compared with the experimental result the values of uy are near zero for both experimental and simulation approaches as can be seen in fig 5 for ux values although the trends of experimental and simulation results are in concordance there is only a minor change in the locations of the centroid ux 0 that can be attributed to the effect of differences in the degree of the sharpness of the corners in experimental and simulation analysis 4 2 displacement mechanisms and fluid configurations displacement mechanisms can play a pivotal role in the forces acting on the phase interface leading to change in interface shape to assess recirculation behavior in various displacement mechanisms imbibition and drainage mechanisms within pore doublet models were simulated at the same injection velocity 100 µm s fig 6 shows the fluid configuration and velocity field through the pore doublet model for both cases the blue phase is wetting and the orange is non wetting the tubes show the velocity intensity through the invading phase and arrows depict the direction of flow through the trapped phase depending on the configuration of the fluids to the flow direction the counter clockwise or clockwise recirculation inside the trapped phase is formed zarikos et al 2018 this rotational flow is attributed to the shear stress transmitted at the interface of the fluids in contrast to the imbibition case the trapped phase has a concavity shape in the drainage mechanism where two tails of the wetting phase are elongated along the solid wall some research has been conducted to observe the characteristics of rotational flow during this mechanism in complex 2d porous media fakhari et al 2018 kazemifar et al 2016 li et al 2017 here the focus was on the various pore structures combined in a pore assembly to assess the recirculation process at low velocity using eq 9 the capillary number of invading phase was calculated where ui is invading phase velocity µi is invading phase viscosity and σ is surface tension the calculated cai was around 3 3 10 5 and m viscosity ratio was 10 9 c a i u i μ i σ 4 2 1 right hand cavity perpendicular to the mean flow direction the cavity located on the right side of the pore doublet model resembles a t junction geometry to the mean flow direction fig 7 depicts the fluid distribution and velocity vectors on the right side of the pore assembly for both imbibition and drainage mechanisms while the arrows show a counter clockwise flow direction through the trapped phase the color tube illustrates the velocity inside the trapped phase where a zero velocity zone was formed at the centroid of the recirculation region in the case of the imbibition mechanism because the non wetting phase was trapped at the end of the right side a convex meniscus was formed at the fluid interface at the upper and lower sides of the interface inside the invading phase in the right side of pore assembly there were two zero velocity zones proving the presence of two stagnant regions which are shown by red circles in fig 7 a in the case of the drainage mechanism we observed no stagnant zones inside the invading fluid near the fluid fluid interface which is attributed to the recirculation inside the wetting phase even at two tails elongated at solid walls to analyze the velocity distribution inside the trapped phase the fluid velocity curves along the vertical and horizontal axis to the centroid of the trapped phase are shown in figs 8 and 9 marked by black dashed lines in fig 7 fig 8 demonstrates the fluid velocity curves ux uy and velocity magnitude umag along the horizontal axis to the centroid of the trapped phase for both imbibition and drainage mechanisms shown by horizontal black dashed lines from point a to b in fig 7 similar velocity field behavior was observed in both cases while changes in velocity magnitude trends at the fluid fluid interface were more noticeable in drainage displacement uy is significantly higher than ux so umag is mostly affected by the uy value whereas the changes in uy values show a change in flow direction within the trapped phase showing the location of the centroid in the trapped phase the presence of interface changes in the slope of the profile velocity heshmati and piri 2018 the zero velocity zone is detected at the recirculation centroid inside the trapped phase and moved toward the wall for the drainage case no symmetry in the velocity field around the centroid can be seen since the phase distribution is not the same on the right and left sides of the centroid fig 9 demonstrates the fluid velocity curves along the vertical axis relative to the trapped phase centroid shown by vertical black dashed lines in fig 7 the trend of the umag curve along the vertical axis has an m shape an increase immediately after the upper interface a decrease close to the centroid an increase as it moves away from the centroid and finally a decrease toward the solid wall in the case of imbibition mechanism the sharp change in the umag curve at early microns expresses how interface occurs in such a way that the velocity value inside the recirculating trapped phase is one order of magnitude higher than those in stagnant zones inside the invading phase as the viscosity of the trapped phase is noticeably lower than the invading phase the momentum transfer cannot cause a vortex inside the stagnant zones the uy values are fully negative along the vertical axis as the flow is downward along the vertical axis on the contrary during drainage displacements the main flow of the invading phase collides between the interface as the trapped phase is stretched on the solid surface at both the upper and lower sides of the interface it led to the formation of a more elongated centroid resulting in positive uy between the vertical axis also no stagnant regions can be detected as the vertical axis to the centroid fell completely into the trapped phase distribution of the velocity inside the trapped and invading phases near the interface can be better understood in the surface velocity plots presented in figures in the appendices 4 2 2 left hand cavity vicinity of solid liquid interface to the liquid liquid interface the cavity on the left side of the pore doublet model helps us understand recirculation behavior where the solid surface is near the liquid liquid interface fig 12 illustrates the fluids distribution and velocity vectors on the left side of the pore assembly for both displacement mechanisms in the case of the imbibition mechanism part of the adjacent throat close to the circular solid surface is filled by the non wetting trapped phase while the rest is occupied by the flowing wetting phase the convexity of the trapped phase inside the throat as well as the circular solid surface close to the interface caused a small clockwise recirculation through the narrow layer of the non wetting phase inside the throat the black arrows show a reverse direction of flow in this zone this recirculation is followed by a vast circulation inside the cavity and around the circular solid similar to the right side of the pore assembly two stagnant regions in the upper and lower parts of the trapped non wetting phase are shown by two red circles in fig 10 a on the other hand during drainage displacement the layer of the trapped phase inside the throat is rather thin the low thickness of the trapped phase within the throat the concavity of the trapped phase and the existence of a solid surface in the vicinity of fluid fluid interfaces result in the creation of two individual centroids with clockwise circulation the reverse direction of flow near the solid surface in these zones is shown by the black direction in fig 10 b the wetting layer adhered to the solid surface is so thin inside the throat that a complete circulation around the circular solid surface cannot be seen consequently two centroids upper and lower of the thin layer are formed 4 2 3 bottom dead end behind the mean flow direction the presence of the bottom dead end makes it possible to examine recirculation behavior inside a trapped phase in a location behind the mean flow direction fig 11 shows the fluid configuration and velocity fields in the bottom dead end of the pore assembly in contrast to two other cases the dead end is not fully trapped and around half of it is occupied by the invading phase this offers a chance to the invading phase to circulate inside the dead end in both cases although in some studies more than one vortex is observed in a trapped phase kashid et al 2005 liu et al 2017 zarikos et al 2018 here two adjacent circulations coexist in invading and trapped phases the circulation of the invading phase transfers enough shear stress to the trapped phase causing recirculation the recirculation directions are opposite inside the invading and trapped phases present at the dead end clockwise inside invading fluid and counter clockwise within the trapped phase analogous to two other cases during imbibition mechanism stagnant areas are formed inside the invading wetting phase adjacent to the liquid liquid and solid liquid interfaces distribution of the velocity inside the trapped phase and invading phase near the interface can be better understood in the surface plots of velocity for various fluid configurations presented in figs b1 b3 in the appendix 4 3 drag force analysis our goal is to quantify and analyze the velocity distributions inside the recirculating trapped phase in both imbibition and drainage mechanisms detailed velocity fields near the fluid fluid interface are used for drag force quantification zarikos et al 2018 the drag force analysis helps us better understand recirculation behavior for various fluid configurations as well as the displacement mechanism viscous drag force per unit of the depth of interface exerted on each part of the interface is calculated as 10 d n μ i u x y u y x dl where d is drag force per unit of the depth of interface n is the normal vector μi is the viscosity of the invading phase and l is the interface length the distribution of drag force per unit of interface depth for the right side cavity is shown in fig 12 it clearly shows that in the case of imbibition the maximum drag force from the invading phase is exerted around the center of the interface while in two stagnant regions at the upper and lower sides of the interface inside the invading phase drag force has a reverse direction it shows that in these areas the force is exerted from the recirculating trapped phase however it cannot cause recirculation inside the invading phase as the invading phase viscosity is noticeably high in contrast in the case of the drainage mechanism drag force is at a minimum around the central parts of the interface and an increase can be seen by moving toward the upper and lower sides of the interface this drag force distribution along the interface directly affects the centroid shape inside the recirculating trapped phase the values for the centroid elongation factor which is defined as the parallel diameter of centroid to the interface divided by the perpendicular one are 1 11 and 2 76 for imbibition and drainage mechanisms respectively it proves that the more the drag force is exerted on the upper and lower sides of the interface the more elongation factor of the centroid is obtained the average velocities inside the recirculation trapped zone for drainage and imbibition mechanisms were 12 36 µm s and 10 µm s respectively this shows that the presence of two stagnant zones during the imbibition mechanism leads to less intensified recirculation in other words less interface is exposed to the high velocity invading phase during imbibition displacement for a better understanding of recirculation behavior near the solid surface drag force distribution along the right side of the solid circle close to the interface inside the left hand cavity fig 10 was analyzed and is shown in fig 13 the remarkable point is that immediately before and after the center of circulations two stagnant zones with minimized drag force exerted on the solid circle exist for both imbibition and drainage mechanisms the drag force values were higher for the lower part of the semicircle as the radius of the channel around the circle was lower leading to higher velocities for the drainage mechanism the drag force suddenly increased at the central part of the semicircle where the thickness of the trapped layer was significantly decreased the drag force applied on the semicircle in the case of the drainage mechanism was higher as the average velocities inside the trapped zones were 22 46 and 13 55 µm s for drainage and imbibition displacements respectively analysis of drag force distribution along the interface for bottom dead end depicted in fig 14 shows similar behavior to the other two cases although the recirculation of the invading phase in the vicinity of the trapped phase provides enough shear stress to recirculate the trapped phase this was not sufficient to cause intensified circulation analysis of average velocities inside the trapped phase reveals that the velocities inside the trapped phase at the bottom dead end were two orders of magnitude less than the cavities the elongation factors for centroids of rotation were 0 66 and 1 44 for imbibition and drainage respectively this is consistent with the results for the drainage mechanism in right hand cavity the more drag force exerted on two elongated tails of trapped phase on the solid surface on which the trapped phase is adhered results in higher elongation factor of the centroid the detailed average velocities of trapped phases are shown in table 3 where the effects of displacement mechanism and fluid configuration on average velocities are obvious the higher average velocity inside the trapped phase is seen in the case of drainage compared to imbibition the average velocity was at a maximum for the left side cavity where the narrowness of the throat resulted in high momentum transfer from the invading phase to the trapped one the minimum average velocity inside the trapped phase was at the bottom dead end which was behind the mean flow direction consequently the least momentum was transferred to the trapped phase another factor that is of great importance is the volume of the trapped phase normalized by interfacial area vtrap aint listed in table 4 for various cases this parameter can give a good sense of the dispersion of the drag force through the trapped phase although the values of vtrap aint are slightly higher for the drainage mechanism the more intensified recirculation can be seen in these cases this is because of greater accessibility to the interfacial area during drainage as no stagnant zones exist near the interface the point that draws attention to itself is that the vtrap aint was lowest in the bottom dead end alongside the minimum average velocity as the bottom dead end was behind the mean flow direction the drag force exerted on the interface was low this decreased the average velocity inside the trapped phase in bottom dead end in comparison to two other locations in pore assembly even in the case of low vtrap aint 4 4 effect of fluid dynamic properties on recirculation behavior although experimental and numerical studies have analyzed the role of capillary forces and viscosity ratio on the mobilization of the trapped phase as well as the recirculation intensity inside the trapped ganglia kashid et al 2005 2007 liu et al 2017 ma et al 2014 however the effects of parameters incorporating in capillary number of invading and trapped phases c a i v i μ i σ c a t u t μ t σ and the viscosity ratio on the movement of the center of rotation and average velocity of the recirculating trapped zone are not well discussed in the available literature here we analyze recirculation behavior under various dynamic conditions 4 4 1 viscosity ratio li et al 2015 investigated the effect of viscosity ratio at a constant reynolds number on the velocity field inside a spherical droplet exposed to shear flow they observed that depending on the viscosity ratio a change in location of the source points centroids of recirculation can be seen in this case we investigated the effect of viscosity ratio on the recirculation performance at a low capillary number to understand the role of viscosity ratio diverse viscosity ratio ranges for various cases including water polymer solution heavy oil displacement in porous media m μ i μ t from 1 100 to 100 were considered during an imbibition displacement through the pore doublet model where a non wetting phase was patched only on the right hand cavity the constant injection velocity was 1 10 4 m s and surface tension of 0 05 n m as the vertical movements of centers of rotations for different viscosity ratios are negligible the changes in the horizontal location of centroids to the basis case m 1 are shown in fig 15 by deviating the viscosity ratio from unity to the higher or lower ones the centroids shift to the right the more the invading viscosity the more drag force is exerted on the interface pushing the interface to the right side on the other hand as the viscosity of the trapped phase increases the more energy is dissipated through the trapped phase pilotti et al 2002 consequently although the interface moves to the left due to the change in drag force balance the dissipation results in the movement of centroid to the right in fig 16 the change in the average velocity of the trapped phase versus the viscosity ratio is shown it illustrates that by increasing the viscosity ratio the average velocity inside the trapping phase logarithmically increases this logarithmic behavior can be attributed to the coupled effects of changes in transmitted shear stress dissipation of energy inside the trapped phase and movement of centroid 4 4 2 interfacial tension ift as the interfacial tension affects the shape of the liquid liquid interface brackbill et al 1992 it can directly influence the recirculation of the trapping phase therefore the displacement process from low values for surfactant hydrocarbon systems to high values for water hydrocarbon systems is simulated in ranges of 1 to 50 mn m during an imbibition displacement through the pore doublet model where the non wetting phase is patched only on the right hand cavity the constant injection velocity is equal to 1 10 4 m s and viscosities are 0 01 and 0 001 pa s for invading and trapped phase respectively as the interfacial tension decreases the curvature of interface changes from a concave shape to a flatter form consequently the centroid of recirculation shifts toward the right side of the pore assembly that can be seen in fig 17 as the interfacial tension increases the capillary forces are strengthened as a result resistance to flow appears which leads to weakened circulation therefore as it is shown in fig 18 an overall logarithmic decrease is seen in the average velocity trend as the interfacial tension increases changes in interfacial tension reshape the interface between the invading and trapped phases consequently the distribution of drag force along the interface is varied on the other hand changes in the location of the centroids in conjugation with changes in drag force distribution cause the logarithmic non linear behavior of average velocity inside the trapped phase 4 4 3 injection velocity to examine the effect of injection velocities on the velocity field through the trapping phase various injection velocities from 1 10 3 to 3 10 6 with a stepwise increase for imbibition mechanism were considered surface tension is equal to 0 05 n m and viscosities are 0 01 and 0 001 pa s for invading and trapped phase respectively the results illustrated while the increase in velocity field is linearly proportional to the injection velocity can be seen no change in location of the centroid is observable fig 19 depicts the log log plot of average velocity inside the trapped phase versus the injected velocity linear behavior between the average velocity inside the trapped phase and injection velocity can be seen 4 4 4 the role of capillary number as discussed displacement mechanism and fluid configurations can influence recirculation behavior inside the trapped phase drag force analysis was performed to quantify the recirculation phenomenon we have shown that how the dynamic parameters are incorporated in capillary number influences recirculation behavior including average velocity in the trapped phase and centroid movement further analysis is required to address the behavior of recirculation phenomenon in response to the changes in capillary number as a dimensionless number unifying all of these elements in this regard the behavior of capillary number of trapped phase c a t u t μ t σ as a function of capillary number of invading phase for various viscosity ratios is evaluated as it is shown in fig 20 a linear relationship between the capillary numbers of trapped and invading phases was found for all viscosity ratios for the viscosity ratios more than unity m 1 increase in viscosity of invading phase results in less capillary number in trapped phase as the less drag force is transmitted to the interface on the other hand for the viscosity ratios less than unity m 1 the amount of drag force transmitted to the fluid fluid interface is constant and increase in viscosity of trapped phase results in a minor increase in capillary number of trapped phase this is attributed to the fact that the effect of increase in viscosity of trapped phase on the capillary number is cancelled out with intensified energy dissipation inside the trapped phase 5 summary and conclusion the numerical simulation of the immiscible displacement process through a pore doublet model was performed in such a way to set trapped phase patches in specified locations of the pore assembly to capture the pore scale processes at low capillary number we used a filtered surface formulation of direct pore scale modeling for drainage and imbibition mechanisms the results showed in the case of ranges capillary number of invading phase analyzed in this study in order of 1 10 2 to 1 10 7 that a recirculation phenomenon exists in the trapped phase while various behaviors were observed zero velocity zones were observed at the centroids of the recirculation trapped phase in the imbibition mechanism the convexity of the trapped phase created two stagnant regions in the vicinity of the interface inside the invading fluid in the drainage mechanism the concavity of the trapped phase wiped out the stagnant zones inside the invading fluid adjacent to the fluid fluid interface drag force analysis on the liquid liquid interface shows that the maximum force was exerted near the center of the interface during imbibition whereas during drainage the greater force was applied on two elongated interface tails on the solid surface the elongation factor of the centroid is a function of displacement mechanism drag force distribution along the interface elongated parallel to the interface during drainage perpendicularly during imbibition the existence of a solid surface accentuated the recirculation process so that one or more centroids can be created depending on the displacement mechanism analysis of drag force distribution on the solid surface showed that near the centroids adjacent to the solid surface stagnant zones were created in the case of the lower ratio of the trapped phase s radius to the cavity depth two simultaneous recirculation zones inside the adjacent invading and trapped phases were formed fluid dynamic properties play a pivotal role in recirculation behavior for all viscosity ratios a linear relationship between the capillary numbers of trapped and invading phases exists the combined effects of changes in the drag force distribution along with the interface of two phases as well movement of centroids cause logarithmic behavior of average velocity inside the trapped phase while this parameter shows a linear trend with changes in injection velocity as the centroid is fixed for various injection velocity these results can be considered as a cornerstone for more complicated cases like co2 sequestration or reservoir in situ combustion where the other parameters can be combined with momentum transfer such as mass and heat transfer our quantified recirculation results provide great insights into the mobilization process in porous media where forces such as viscosity inertia

various locations of pore assembly also it shows that the velocity inside the trapped phase is noticeably less than the adjacent invading phase closing to the wall solid surface the velocity decreases the direction of rotation inside the trapped phase is a function of fluid configuration within the pore assembly as well as the direction of flow 
394,understanding multiphase flow in porous media especially how velocity is distributed at the pore scale has been the aim of several studies however these studies address the recirculation behavior inside the trapped phase experimentally without any comprehensive numerical study of the impact of different governing mechanisms related to the fluid configurations and properties including drag force and capillary number analysis at low capillary number regime in this study we analyzed the recirculation phenomenon inside the trapped phase for various displacement mechanisms fluid configurations and dynamic properties to simulate the pore scale displacement at low capillary number we used a filtered surface force formulation of volume of fluid method which was implemented in a separately available solver for openfoam package the results showed that within the ranges of capillary number of invading phase analyzed in this study in the order of 1 10 7 to 1 10 2 the recirculation phenomenon exists in trapped phases during the imbibition mechanism two stagnant regions are created adjacent to the fluid fluid interface inside the invading fluid drag force analysis on fluid fluid interfaces shows that during imbibition the maximum force is exerted near the center of the interface whereas during drainage more force is applied on two elongated interface tails on a solid surface the centroids are elongated parallel to the interface during drainage and perpendicularly during imbibition which is in concordance with drag force distribution along with the interface the existence of a solid surface near the fluid fluid interface affects the recirculation process in a way that one or more centroids can be created depending on displacement mechanisms when the ratio of trapped phase radius to cavity depth is lower two simultaneous recirculation zones are formed inside the invading and trapped phases while the changes in viscosity ratio and interfacial tension shifted the centroid location inside the trapped zone the center of rotation seems to be independent of injection velocity the average velocity of trapped phase is individually a logarithmic function of the surface tension and fluids viscosity ratio the stationariness of centroid results in a linear relationship between the average velocity inside the trapped zone and injection velocity for all ranges of viscosity ratios a linear relationship between the capillary number of invading and trapped phase is obtained the findings of this study lead to a better understanding of trapping and

enhanced oil recovery zhao et al 2010 soil remediation aminnaji et al 2019 and carbon hydrogen storage ebigbo et al 2013 riazi et al 2011 various microscale forces including capillary viscous inertial and gravitational forces play an important role in fluid dynamics especially at the interface dejam et al 2014 ferrari and lunati 2014 2013 mashayekhizadeh et al 2011 méheust et al 2002 raeini et al 2014 the roles of rock and fluid properties that can significantly affect the displacement process are also important avraam and payatakes 1995 specifically pore scale investigation is a strong tool that can shed light on the subsurface process at the microscale to investigate the physics of fluid flow at pore scale 2d glass micromodels can be used in conjunction with fluorescence microscopy and micro particle image velocimetry micro piv to directly observe and measure the pore scale processes jiménez martínez et al 2017 roman et al 2016 2019 roman et al 2016 investigated the velocity profiles in two phase flow through the heterogeneous sandstone replica micromodel using micro piv the results depicted recirculation motion inside the immobile pockets of the wetting phase due to momentum transmitted by the flowing oil kazemifar et al 2016 reported shear induced circulation in trapped water ganglia during post front passage displacement of water by supercritical co2 in a homogenous micromodel in concordance with the kazemifar et al work li et al 2017 observed the shear induced circulation during post front passage flow in a heterogeneous micromodel for a supercritical co2 water system they determined co2 flow directions with the aim of circulation within the trapped water phase as it is very difficult to directly measure co2 flow using micro piv heshmati and piri 2018 observed the recirculation process in a pore doublet model in the viscous dominant regime they reported that the shear stress applied to the trapped non wetting phase was intensified as the viscous forces increased the effect of increasing injection velocity on the velocity of the non wetting phase was less noticeable indicating the presence of a slip boundary between the fluids zarikos et al 2018 analyzed the interaction of capillarity and momentum transfer between the two immiscible phases for different non wetting trapped globules with various sizes in contrast with stagnant areas where the viscous drag applied on the fluid fluid interface is negligible in nonzero velocity areas the momentum transfers cause circulations within the trapped phase the circulation velocity is maximum near the fluid fluid interface and an increase in capillary number of invading phase increases the circulation velocity as well as the shift in circulation centroid toward high velocity region similar to the circulation phenomenon process for trapped phases in porous media there are other two phase systems in which this process is noticeable bhaga and weber 1981 maxworthy et al 1996 the effect of capillary numbers slug size and viscosity ratios on internal recirculation within two phases in capillary channels have been investigated in several experimental kashid et al 2007 liu et al 2017 ma et al 2014 and numerical studies kashid et al 2005 sarrazin et al 2006 contrary to the recent studies where the velocity fields were observed in only one phase usually the water phase two phase flow can be explored using an appropriate two phase flow simulator pore network modeling as a low cost computational tool has advanced during recent years in both quasi static and dynamic modes blunt 2001 oren et al 1998 direct numerical simulation methods including smoothed particle hydrodynamic sph as a meshless method hirschler et al 2016 the lattice boltzmann method lbm kang et al 2002 and computational fluid dynamic methods cfd raeini et al 2012 can perform simulation at high resolution of the real structure of pore spaces fakhari et al 2018 using the lattice boltzmann model for the simulation of multiphase flows of water co2 systems in a micromodel observed the recirculating flows in the still flowing co2 phase as the impacts of inertial forces direct numerical simulation of pore scale processes by cfd methods have gained great prominence due to their ability to simulate fluid flow for wide density and viscosity ratio ranges meakin and tartakovsky 2009 in a recent study using direct numerical simulation the results of drainage processes in a 2d cavity showed better mixing processes and larger interfacial mass transfer in the presence of recirculation inside the cavity maes and soulaine 2018 shams et al 2018 analyzed the viscous coupling effects as a function of the viscosity ratio wettability and varying fluid configurations in circular capillary tubes raeini et al 2014 studied the snap off and layer flow to analyze the impact of geometry and flow rate on the hydraulic conductivity of disconnected ganglia using volume of fluid vof based finite volume method to consider interfacial tension various approaches can be applied to vof the continuous surface stress css method gueyffier et al 1999 the continuous surface force csf method brackbill et al 1992 and the sharp surface force ssf francois et al 2006 raeini et al 2012 in these approaches it is very difficult to predict flow at low capillary numbers where the capillary forces are dominant which can result in non physical velocity currents around the interface raeini et al 2014 to eliminate the non physical behavior from the numerical solution for the cases of capillary forces dominancy the filtered surface force fsf is introduced raeini et al 2012 specifically the capillary pressure dynamic pressure gradients and viscous and inertial forces are separately calculated to prevent introducing instabilities in the numerical equations it is shown that the spurious current is minimum around the interface when the fsf is used pavuluri et al 2018 the concept and application of the recirculation phenomenon are of great importance especially for processes contending with mass transport kazemifar et al 2016 li et al 2017 maes and soulaine 2018 recently some research has been carried out to investigate this phenomenon in both experimental roman et al 2016 zarikos et al 2018 and numerical approaches fakhari et al 2018 maes and soulaine 2018 however they have not discussed the role of displacement mechanism and fluid configurations on the recirculation process also in the case of experimental investigations kazemifar et al 2016 roman et al 2016 2019 zarikos et al 2018 the velocity profile is only presented inside the trapped phase maes et al 2018 investigated the role of recirculation phenomena on the mass transfer process for various viscosity ratios however they did not consider the effects of injection velocity and surface tension as other dynamic parameters involved in the capillary number zarikos et al 2018 investigated how the center of circulation and average velocity of the trapped phase moved for various capillary numbers but they did not discuss the behavior of capillary number for various viscosity ratios this work sheds light on the recirculation process for both imbibition and drainage mechanisms for various fluid configurations at low capillary number also using drag force analysis on fluid fluid and fluid solid interfaces we comprehensively discuss the behavior of recirculation phenomena in addition we discuss the analysis of dynamic parameters including injection velocity viscosity ratio and surface tension individually on the behavior of recirculation we used the fsf formulation of the vof method implemented in porefoam separately available solver for openfoam to simulate two phase flow inside a 2d pore doublet model at low capillary number in this study we addressed the question of how recirculation behavior changes under various dynamic and static conditions as the multiphase flow simulation is carried out in the real structure of pore spaces this study is new to those that use simplified models such as pore network modeling also using the fsf formulation of the vof method minimizes the spurious currents introduced in numerical equations on the other hand the simulation run time is relatively long due to small time steps that should be used especially at low capillary numbers the main limitation is that even with this advanced method the simulation of fluid flow for the invading phase capillary numbers lower than 10 7 cannot be performed also because of high computational cost investigation of more complex porous media was not feasible the increase in mesh size and shortness of time steps might have led to a long simulation time the results of this work can be applied for cases where recirculation plays a pivotal role along with mass transfer such as co2 storage analyzing drag force on the fluid fluid interface is also important in processes where the balance of forces on the interface determines the mobilization or trapping of the droplet during enhanced oil recovery methods dejam and hassanzadeh 2018 olayiwola and dejam 2019 yang et al 2020 2019 fig 1 is a

calculated as a body force brackbill et al 1992 6 f c σ k n i δ s where σ is surface tension n i is the unit interface normal vector δ is the delta function active along the interface and k n i is the interface curvature and is normal to the interface 7 n i α α detailed forced filtered formulation of the volume of fluid method is discussed in appendix a 2 2 computational domain two phase flow simulations were performed in designed 2d pore doublets inspired by the heshmati and piri 2018 study on velocity fields and shear stress at fluid fluid interfaces in a controlled environment figure shows the 2d geometrical model used in this study the width of the inlet and outlet of the pore assembly was 120 µm and the model was 410 µm long this specific model enabled us to examine recirculation inside the trapped phases in various geometrical structures where dead ends and cavities were designed to resemble the likeliest zones in porous media for the trapping process the left and right sides of pore doublet models are cavities perpendicular to the main flow while in the left side a circular solid provides an opportunity to analyze the rotational flow in the vicinity of solid surfaces the bottom dead end is behind the main flow direction allowing investigation of the recirculation in a zone where the invading phase velocities are relatively low by subdividing the primary domain into non overlapping subdomains as smaller discrete cells flow eqs 1 7 and a1 a11 are solved the domain was meshed using openfoam meshing tools snappyhexmesh weller et al 1998 to visualize the processes we used paraview 2 3 fluid properties to analyze the role of displacement mechanisms on recirculation processes in various fluid configurations inside the pore assembly we considered a set of fluid properties listed in table 1 the properties were designed to ensure that enough shear stress was transmitted to the trapped phase in both drainage and imbibition mechanisms to examine the effects of dynamic parameters involving capillary number including surface tension velocity and viscosity ratio different ranges were considered and explained in that section as the bond number bo δρgl σ where l is the characteristic length is equal to zero due to the presence of fluids with the same densities the effect of gravitational forces is not a focus in this study 2 4 boundary and initial condition one of the essential physical parameters which should be defined in the numerical solver is suitable boundary conditions zero longitudinal velocity magnitude ux is considered while the imposition of uniform velocity profile equal to 1 0 10 4 m s supplies the latitudinal velocity uy at the inlet for outlet boundary zero gauge global pressure we considered a resemblance with atmospheric pressure inlet gradient pressure values and the velocity gradient at the outlet were fixed at zero during all simulations the grain surfaces predetermined wetting properties depending on the displacement mechanism i e fully wet to the invading phase in the case of imbibition and fully non wet to the invading phase in the case of drainage the normal velocity component at a fluid solid interface was set at zero no slip conditions to analyze the recirculation behavior inside the trapped phases in similar conditions the model was initially set to be filled with invading fluid then the trapped phase was locally patched at three individual locations on the right and left sides of the pore assembly and around the bottom dead end then the invading fluid with a certain contact angle depending on the displacement mechanism i e zero for imbibition and 180 for drainage was injected at the inlet 2 5 solution methodology for a time dependent approach for 2d simulations an open source finite volume cfd package was used the fsf formulation of the vof method raeini et al 2012 with pressure implicit split operator piso algorithms issa 1986 was a segregated procedure used to solve the pressure velocity and volume fraction coupling equations we used a semi implicit formulation of capillary forces to confirm the accuracy and stability of the numerical method adjustable time steps with a maximum courant number of 1 0 10 5 ferziger and perić 2002 were used the time steps were designed in a way to satisfy the constraints below raeini et al 2012 8 δ t c δ t μ δ x σ where δt is time step size δx is mesh resolution and c st is a constant varying depending on the formulation of capillary forces explicit or semi implicit raeini et al 2012 the simulations in this work were performed on intel core i9 5 ghz 16 mb cache with 16 processors and 16 gb ram 3 validation and verification 3 1 mesh independency the mesh density of the network is governed in a way that no dependency between the discretization and variable can be observed the openfoam snappyhexmesh utility was used for domain meshing this tool allows good refinement of grids in the various parts of a pore assembly the mesh quality was confirmed by analysis of grid refinement where numbers of mesh elements were increased gradually from 8800 to 79 000 corresponding to the number of cells in the narrowest throat from 9 to 11 13 and up to 23 the residuals average velocity and velocity distributions inside the sub domains were calculated in each simulation to confirm the grid size convergence the results showed that the simulation with 19 cells in the narrowest throat equivalent to a mesh size of 55 635 cells led to minimum error while the finer mesh did not decrease the error fig 3 illustrates the mesh inside the pore assembly 4 results this section considers the simulation results of two individual displacement mechanisms i e imbibition and drainage through the pore doublet model in both cases three patches of defending phase were trapped in the right and left sides of the pore doublet model as well as the bottom dead end this fluid configuration within the pore assembly not only facilitated the analysis of recirculation behavior in various arrangements to the flow direction but also provided the same conditions for both displacement mechanisms prior to any displacement simulation the trapped patches were relaxed for 0 03 s to remove the capillary oscillation effects from the numerical calculations during this process no inflow or outflow of the fluids across the boundaries was considered to make the interface reaching equilibrium configuration depending on the contact angle then the displacement process was simulated to reach the steady state condition depending on the displacement mechanism 4 1 model validation to ensure the accuracy of the numerical model the simulation results were validated with available experimental data mentioned in the study of heshmati and piri 2018 heshmati and piri 2018 they analyzed the recirculation process inside one side of a pore doublet model originally inspired by chatzis and dullien 1983 for immiscible displacement table 2 shows the values for velocities at 10 µm intervals to the liquid liquid interface inside invading and trapped phases our simulation results show that in a similar boundary and initial conditions to their experimental study a recirculation zone was created inside the non wetting trapped phase at the right side of pore assembly analysis of velocity distribution at both sides of liquid liquid interface shows that the velocities are in good agreement with the experiment due to the low quality of images in heshmati and piri 2018 we validated this process using other experimental data we used the experimental data related to a drainage process inside dead end pore micromodels i e eddy pockets roman et al 2019 to simulate the drainage mechanism eddy pockets including three connected cavities were considered fig 4 a then with the same boundary and initial conditions to their experimental study the non wetting phase was injected through the micromodel to avoid the borders effect the central cavity results were selected to be compared with the experimental results a mesh sensitivity was performed and mesh size equal to 93 600 cells equivalent to cell size of 1 6 micron was selected as the optimum density as fig 4 b shows good agreement can be seen between the numerical simulation and experimental results especially in phase distributions and the velocity profile inside the cavity to better understand the velocity distribution inside the trapped phase the values of ux and uy along the vertical axis to the centroid dashed white line in fig 4 b c for the simulation process are compared with the experimental result the values of uy are near zero for both experimental and simulation approaches as can be seen in fig 5 for ux values although the trends of experimental and simulation results are in concordance there is only a minor change in the locations of the centroid ux 0 that can be attributed to the effect of differences in the degree of the sharpness of the corners in experimental and simulation analysis 4 2 displacement mechanisms and fluid configurations displacement mechanisms can play a pivotal role in the forces acting on the phase interface leading to change in interface shape to assess recirculation behavior in various displacement mechanisms imbibition and drainage mechanisms within pore doublet models were simulated at the same injection velocity 100 µm s fig 6 shows the fluid configuration and velocity field through the pore doublet model for both cases the blue phase is wetting and the orange is non wetting the tubes show the velocity intensity through the invading phase and arrows depict the direction of flow through the trapped phase depending on the configuration of the fluids to the flow direction the counter clockwise or clockwise recirculation inside the trapped phase is formed zarikos et al 2018 this rotational flow is attributed to the shear stress transmitted at the interface of the fluids in contrast to the imbibition case the trapped phase has a concavity shape in the drainage mechanism where two tails of the wetting phase are elongated along the solid wall some research has been conducted to observe the characteristics of rotational flow during this mechanism in complex 2d porous media fakhari et al 2018 kazemifar et al 2016 li et al 2017 here the focus was on the various pore structures combined in a pore assembly to assess the recirculation process at low velocity using eq 9 the capillary number of invading phase was calculated where ui is invading phase velocity µi is invading phase viscosity and σ is surface tension the calculated cai was around 3 3 10 5 and m viscosity ratio was 10 9 c a i u i μ i σ 4 2 1 right hand cavity perpendicular to the mean flow direction the cavity located on the right side of the pore doublet model resembles a t junction geometry to the mean flow direction fig 7 depicts the fluid distribution and velocity vectors on the right side of the pore assembly for both imbibition and drainage mechanisms while the arrows show a counter clockwise flow direction through the trapped phase the color tube illustrates the velocity inside the trapped phase where a zero velocity zone was formed at the centroid of the recirculation region in the case of the imbibition mechanism because the non wetting phase was trapped at the end of the right side a convex meniscus was formed at the fluid interface at the upper and lower sides of the interface inside the invading phase in the right side of pore assembly there were two zero velocity zones proving the presence of two stagnant regions which are shown by red circles in fig 7 a in the case of the drainage mechanism we observed no stagnant zones inside the invading fluid near the fluid fluid interface which is attributed to the recirculation inside the wetting phase even at two tails elongated at solid walls to analyze the velocity distribution inside the trapped phase the fluid velocity curves along the vertical and horizontal axis to the centroid of the trapped phase are shown in figs 8 and 9 marked by black dashed lines in fig 7 fig 8 demonstrates the fluid velocity curves ux uy and velocity magnitude umag along the horizontal axis to the centroid of the trapped phase for both imbibition and drainage mechanisms shown by horizontal black dashed lines from point a to b in fig 7 similar velocity field behavior was observed in both cases while changes in velocity magnitude trends at the fluid fluid interface were more noticeable in drainage displacement uy is significantly higher than ux so umag is mostly affected by the uy value whereas the changes in uy values show a change in flow direction within the trapped phase showing the location of the centroid in the trapped phase the presence of interface changes in the slope of the profile velocity heshmati and piri 2018 the zero velocity zone is detected at the recirculation centroid inside the trapped phase and moved toward the wall for the drainage case no symmetry in the velocity field around the centroid can be seen since the phase distribution is not the same on the right and left sides of the centroid fig 9 demonstrates the fluid velocity curves along the vertical axis relative to the trapped phase centroid shown by vertical black dashed lines in fig 7 the trend of the umag curve along the vertical axis has an m shape an increase immediately after the upper interface a decrease close to the centroid an increase as it moves away from the centroid and finally a decrease toward the solid wall in the case of imbibition mechanism the sharp change in the umag curve at early microns expresses how interface occurs in such a way that the velocity value inside the recirculating trapped phase is one order of magnitude higher than those in stagnant zones inside the invading phase as the viscosity of the trapped phase is noticeably lower than the invading phase the momentum transfer cannot cause a vortex inside the stagnant zones the uy values are fully negative along the vertical axis as the flow is downward along the vertical axis on the contrary during drainage displacements the main flow of the invading phase collides between the interface as the trapped phase is stretched on the solid surface at both the upper and lower sides of the interface it led to the formation of a more elongated centroid resulting in positive uy between the vertical axis also no stagnant regions can be detected as the vertical axis to the centroid fell completely into the trapped phase distribution of the velocity inside the trapped and invading phases near the interface can be better understood in the surface velocity plots presented in figures in the appendices 4 2 2 left hand cavity vicinity of solid liquid interface to the liquid liquid interface the cavity on the left side of the pore doublet model helps us understand recirculation behavior where the solid surface is near the liquid liquid interface fig 12 illustrates the fluids distribution and velocity vectors on the left side of the pore assembly for both displacement mechanisms in the case of the imbibition mechanism part of the adjacent throat close to the circular solid surface is filled by the non wetting trapped phase while the rest is occupied by the flowing wetting phase the convexity of the trapped phase inside the throat as well as the circular solid surface close to the interface caused a small clockwise recirculation through the narrow layer of the non wetting phase inside the throat the black arrows show a reverse direction of flow in this zone this recirculation is followed by a vast circulation inside the cavity and around the circular solid similar to the right side of the pore assembly two stagnant regions in the upper and lower parts of the trapped non wetting phase are shown by two red circles in fig 10 a on the other hand during drainage displacement the layer of the trapped phase inside the throat is rather thin the low thickness of the trapped phase within the throat the concavity of the trapped phase and the existence of a solid surface in the vicinity of fluid fluid interfaces result in the creation of two individual centroids with clockwise circulation the reverse direction of flow near the solid surface in these zones is shown by the black direction in fig 10 b the wetting layer adhered to the solid surface is so thin inside the throat that a complete circulation around the circular solid surface cannot be seen consequently two centroids upper and lower of the thin layer are formed 4 2 3 bottom dead end behind the mean flow direction the presence of the bottom dead end makes it possible to examine recirculation behavior inside a trapped phase in a location behind the mean flow direction fig 11 shows the fluid configuration and velocity fields in the bottom dead end of the pore assembly in contrast to two other cases the dead end is not fully trapped and around half of it is occupied by the invading phase this offers a chance to the invading phase to circulate inside the dead end in both cases although in some studies more than one vortex is observed in a trapped phase kashid et al 2005 liu et al 2017 zarikos et al 2018 here two adjacent circulations coexist in invading and trapped phases the circulation of the invading phase transfers enough shear stress to the trapped phase causing recirculation the recirculation directions are opposite inside the invading and trapped phases present at the dead end clockwise inside invading fluid and counter clockwise within the trapped phase analogous to two other cases during imbibition mechanism stagnant areas are formed inside the invading wetting phase adjacent to the liquid liquid and solid liquid interfaces distribution of the velocity inside the trapped phase and invading phase near the interface can be better understood in the surface plots of velocity for various fluid configurations presented in figs b1 b3 in the appendix 4 3 drag force analysis our goal is to quantify and analyze the velocity distributions inside the recirculating trapped phase in both imbibition and drainage mechanisms detailed velocity fields near the fluid fluid interface are used for drag force quantification zarikos et al 2018 the drag force analysis helps us better understand recirculation behavior for various fluid configurations as well as the displacement mechanism viscous drag force per unit of the depth of interface exerted on each part of the interface is calculated as 10 d n μ i u x y u y x dl where d is drag force per unit of the depth of interface n is the normal vector μi is the viscosity of the invading phase and l is the interface length the distribution of drag force per unit of interface depth for the right side cavity is shown in fig 12 it clearly shows that in the case of imbibition the maximum drag force from the invading phase is exerted around the center of the interface while in two stagnant regions at the upper and lower sides of the interface inside the invading phase drag force has a reverse direction it shows that in these areas the force is exerted from the recirculating trapped phase however it cannot cause recirculation inside the invading phase as the invading phase viscosity is noticeably high in contrast in the case of the drainage mechanism drag force is at a minimum around the central parts of the interface and an increase can be seen by moving toward the upper and lower sides of the interface this drag force distribution along the interface directly affects the centroid shape inside the recirculating trapped phase the values for the centroid elongation factor which is defined as the parallel diameter of centroid to the interface divided by the perpendicular one are 1 11 and 2 76 for imbibition and drainage mechanisms respectively it proves that the more the drag force is exerted on the upper and lower sides of the interface the more elongation factor of the centroid is obtained the average velocities inside the recirculation trapped zone for drainage and imbibition mechanisms were 12 36 µm s and 10 µm s respectively this shows that the presence of two stagnant zones during the imbibition mechanism leads to less intensified recirculation in other words less interface is exposed to the high velocity invading phase during imbibition displacement for a better understanding of recirculation behavior near the solid surface drag force distribution along the right side of the solid circle close to the interface inside the left hand cavity fig 10 was analyzed and is shown in fig 13 the remarkable point is that immediately before and after the center of circulations two stagnant zones with minimized drag force exerted on the solid circle exist for both imbibition and drainage mechanisms the drag force values were higher for the lower part of the semicircle as the radius of the channel around the circle was lower leading to higher velocities for the drainage mechanism the drag force suddenly increased at the central part of the semicircle where the thickness of the trapped layer was significantly decreased the drag force applied on the semicircle in the case of the drainage mechanism was higher as the average velocities inside the trapped zones were 22 46 and 13 55 µm s for drainage and imbibition displacements respectively analysis of drag force distribution along the interface for bottom dead end depicted in fig 14 shows similar behavior to the other two cases although the recirculation of the invading phase in the vicinity of the trapped phase provides enough shear stress to recirculate the trapped phase this was not sufficient to cause intensified circulation analysis of average velocities inside the trapped phase reveals that the velocities inside the trapped phase at the bottom dead end were two orders of magnitude less than the cavities the elongation factors for centroids of rotation were 0 66 and 1 44 for imbibition and drainage respectively this is consistent with the results for the drainage mechanism in right hand cavity the more drag force exerted on two elongated tails of trapped phase on the solid surface on which the trapped phase is adhered results in higher elongation factor of the centroid the detailed average velocities of trapped phases are shown in table 3 where the effects of displacement mechanism and fluid configuration on average velocities are obvious the higher average velocity inside the trapped phase is seen in the case of drainage compared to imbibition the average velocity was at a maximum for the left side cavity where the narrowness of the throat resulted in high momentum transfer from the invading phase to the trapped one the minimum average velocity inside the trapped phase was at the bottom dead end which was behind the mean flow direction consequently the least momentum was transferred to the trapped phase another factor that is of great importance is the volume of the trapped phase normalized by interfacial area vtrap aint listed in table 4 for various cases this parameter can give a good sense of the dispersion of the drag force through the trapped phase although the values of vtrap aint are slightly higher for the drainage mechanism the more intensified recirculation can be seen in these cases this is because of greater accessibility to the interfacial area during drainage as no stagnant zones exist near the interface the point that draws attention to itself is that the vtrap aint was lowest in the bottom dead end alongside the minimum average velocity as the bottom dead end was behind the mean flow direction the drag force exerted on the interface was low this decreased the average velocity inside the trapped phase in bottom dead end in comparison to two other locations in pore assembly even in the case of low vtrap aint 4 4 effect of fluid dynamic properties on recirculation behavior although experimental and numerical studies have analyzed the role of capillary forces and viscosity ratio on the mobilization of the trapped phase as well as the recirculation intensity inside the trapped ganglia kashid et al 2005 2007 liu et al 2017 ma et al 2014 however the effects of parameters incorporating in capillary number of invading and trapped phases c a i v i μ i σ c a t u t μ t σ and the viscosity ratio on the movement of the center of rotation and average velocity of the recirculating trapped zone are not well discussed in the available literature here we analyze recirculation behavior under various dynamic conditions 4 4 1 viscosity ratio li et al 2015 investigated the effect of viscosity ratio at a constant reynolds number on the velocity field inside a spherical droplet exposed to shear flow they observed that depending on the viscosity ratio a change in location of the source points centroids of recirculation can be seen in this case we investigated the effect of viscosity ratio on the recirculation performance at a low capillary number to understand the role of viscosity ratio diverse viscosity ratio ranges for various cases including water polymer solution heavy oil displacement in porous media m μ i μ t from 1 100 to 100 were considered during an imbibition displacement through the pore doublet model where a non wetting phase was patched only on the right hand cavity the constant injection velocity was 1 10 4 m s and surface tension of 0 05 n m as the vertical movements of centers of rotations for different viscosity ratios are negligible the changes in the horizontal location of centroids to the basis case m 1 are shown in fig 15 by deviating the viscosity ratio from unity to the higher or lower ones the centroids shift to the right the more the invading viscosity the more drag force is exerted on the interface pushing the interface to the right side on the other hand as the viscosity of the trapped phase increases the more energy is dissipated through the trapped phase pilotti et al 2002 consequently although the interface moves to the left due to the change in drag force balance the dissipation results in the movement of centroid to the right in fig 16 the change in the average velocity of the trapped phase versus the viscosity ratio is shown it illustrates that by increasing the viscosity ratio the average velocity inside the trapping phase logarithmically increases this logarithmic behavior can be attributed to the coupled effects of changes in transmitted shear stress dissipation of energy inside the trapped phase and movement of centroid 4 4 2 interfacial tension ift as the interfacial tension affects the shape of the liquid liquid interface brackbill et al 1992 it can directly influence the recirculation of the trapping phase therefore the displacement process from low values for surfactant hydrocarbon systems to high values for water hydrocarbon systems is simulated in ranges of 1 to 50 mn m during an imbibition displacement through the pore doublet model where the non wetting phase is patched only on the right hand cavity the constant injection velocity is equal to 1 10 4 m s and viscosities are 0 01 and 0 001 pa s for invading and trapped phase respectively as the interfacial tension decreases the curvature of interface changes from a concave shape to a flatter form consequently the centroid of recirculation shifts toward the right side of the pore assembly that can be seen in fig 17 as the interfacial tension increases the capillary forces are strengthened as a result resistance to flow appears which leads to weakened circulation therefore as it is shown in fig 18 an overall logarithmic decrease is seen in the average velocity trend as the interfacial tension increases changes in interfacial tension reshape the interface between the invading and trapped phases consequently the distribution of drag force along the interface is varied on the other hand changes in the location of the centroids in conjugation with changes in drag force distribution cause the logarithmic non linear behavior of average velocity inside the trapped phase 4 4 3 injection velocity to examine the effect of injection velocities on the velocity field through the trapping phase various injection velocities from 1 10 3 to 3 10 6 with a stepwise increase for imbibition mechanism were considered surface tension is equal to 0 05 n m and viscosities are 0 01 and 0 001 pa s for invading and trapped phase respectively the results illustrated while the increase in velocity field is linearly proportional to the injection velocity can be seen no change in location of the centroid is observable fig 19 depicts the log log plot of average velocity inside the trapped phase versus the injected velocity linear behavior between the average velocity inside the trapped phase and injection velocity can be seen 4 4 4 the role of capillary number as discussed displacement mechanism and fluid configurations can influence recirculation behavior inside the trapped phase drag force analysis was performed to quantify the recirculation phenomenon we have shown that how the dynamic parameters are incorporated in capillary number influences recirculation behavior including average velocity in the trapped phase and centroid movement further analysis is required to address the behavior of recirculation phenomenon in response to the changes in capillary number as a dimensionless number unifying all of these elements in this regard the behavior of capillary number of trapped phase c a t u t μ t σ as a function of capillary number of invading phase for various viscosity ratios is evaluated as it is shown in fig 20 a linear relationship between the capillary numbers of trapped and invading phases was found for all viscosity ratios for the viscosity ratios more than unity m 1 increase in viscosity of invading phase results in less capillary number in trapped phase as the less drag force is transmitted to the interface on the other hand for the viscosity ratios less than unity m 1 the amount of drag force transmitted to the fluid fluid interface is constant and increase in viscosity of trapped phase results in a minor increase in capillary number of trapped phase this is attributed to the fact that the effect of increase in viscosity of trapped phase on the capillary number is cancelled out with intensified energy dissipation inside the trapped phase 5 summary and conclusion the numerical simulation of the immiscible displacement process through a pore doublet model was performed in such a way to set trapped phase patches in specified locations of the pore assembly to capture the pore scale processes at low capillary number we used a filtered surface formulation of direct pore scale modeling for drainage and imbibition mechanisms the results showed in the case of ranges capillary number of invading phase analyzed in this study in order of 1 10 2 to 1 10 7 that a recirculation phenomenon exists in the trapped phase while various behaviors were observed zero velocity zones were observed at the centroids of the recirculation trapped phase in the imbibition mechanism the convexity of the trapped phase created two stagnant regions in the vicinity of the interface inside the invading fluid in the drainage mechanism the concavity of the trapped phase wiped out the stagnant zones inside the invading fluid adjacent to the fluid fluid interface drag force analysis on the liquid liquid interface shows that the maximum force was exerted near the center of the interface during imbibition whereas during drainage the greater force was applied on two elongated interface tails on the solid surface the elongation factor of the centroid is a function of displacement mechanism drag force distribution along the interface elongated parallel to the interface during drainage perpendicularly during imbibition the existence of a solid surface accentuated the recirculation process so that one or more centroids can be created depending on the displacement mechanism analysis of drag force distribution on the solid surface showed that near the centroids adjacent to the solid surface stagnant zones were created in the case of the lower ratio of the trapped phase s radius to the cavity depth two simultaneous recirculation zones inside the adjacent invading and trapped phases were formed fluid dynamic properties play a pivotal role in recirculation behavior for all viscosity ratios a linear relationship between the capillary numbers of trapped and invading phases exists the combined effects of changes in the drag force distribution along with the interface of two phases as well movement of centroids cause logarithmic behavior of average velocity inside the trapped phase while this parameter shows a linear trend with changes in injection velocity as the centroid is fixed for various injection velocity these results can be considered as a cornerstone for more complicated cases like co2 sequestration or reservoir in situ combustion where the other parameters can be combined with momentum transfer such as mass and heat transfer our quantified recirculation results provide great insights into the mobilization process in porous media where forces such as viscosity inertia

various locations of pore assembly also it shows that the velocity inside the trapped phase is noticeably less than the adjacent invading phase closing to the wall solid surface the velocity decreases the direction of rotation inside the trapped phase is a function of fluid configuration within the pore assembly as well as the direction of flow
