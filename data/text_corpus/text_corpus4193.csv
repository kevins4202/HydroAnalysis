20965,the effect of non linear phenomenon such as wave run up and wave impact on the heaving buoy wave energy converter may lead to its efficiency decrease and overtopping in this study a hydrodynamic simulation of wave run up heights and maximum wave loads on a cylindrical heaving buoy is constructed and preliminarily analysed using the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations the numerical results show that kinetic energy is mainly concentrated in the wave ward and leeward sides of the buoy further the maximum pressure at the bottom of the buoy occurs on the leeward side when the wave hits the buoy increasing by 47 over the initial pressure and 32 over the maximum pressure at the centre of the buoy for a heaving buoy with the power take off mechanism pto the damping coefficient is the main parameter that affects the wave run up and wave loads by contrast for a heaving buoy without pto the wave height and the radius of the buoy are the main parameter the accuracy of the numerical results is verified through model tests of the motion response of the buoy and the wave surface characteristics around it the computational method can guide future buoy designs in terms of safety and reliability keywords heaving buoy wave run up wave load wave filed impact pressure 1 introduction as traditional energy sources continue to get depleted at an alarming rate atmospheric pollution worsens and the demand for energy increases wave energy as a clean and sustainable energy source has become the focus of research because of the comparative ease in developing wave energy and the simple acquisition method involved the utilisation of wave energy by human beings can be traced back to more than two centuries ago hundreds of wave energy converters wecs have been developed since falcão 2010 truong and ahn 2014 compared with other devices oscillating buoy wecs are more flexible and efficient shi et al 2016 optimisation of the heaving buoy size and improvement of its conversion efficiency have been the main focus of research attention hals et al 2011 li and yu 2012 zhang and george 2015 xiao et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 however the influence of non linear phenomenon such as wave run up wave impact and overtopping on the buoy has not been studied a buoy is directly exposed to the diverse sea conditions non linear phenomena at rough seas including wave run up and impingement cause overturning plastic deformation and fatigue failure of the heaving buoy which in turn affect its working performance safety and lifespan therefore the non linear phenomena involved in the interaction between buoys and waves must be studied further previous studies have employed experimental and numerical methods to study free surface elevation however these studies mainly focused on stationary objects li et al 2012 performed a wave basin experiment to investigate the interactions between multi directional focused waves and a vertical bottom mounted cylinder they also studied the wave run up on the cylinder milanian et al 2016 integrated computer aided design cad and computational fluid dynamics cfd to investigate the effects of berm width wave height and wave period on the wave run up over berm breakwaters ning et al 2017 investigated the extreme wave run up on a vertical seawall and to that end proposed an extended numerical model that could accurately predict extreme wave run ups zhang and teng 2017 examined the influence of wave non linearity on wave run up around a vertical circular cylinder using dimensionless parameters however the motion coupling between waves and structures is more intense for floating structures such as heaving buoys and semi submersible platforms therefore capturing the parameters of the free surface of such structures is more difficult in addition to experimental models xiao et al 2014 lu et al 2020 and theoretical solutions izadparast and niedzwecki 2010 the most commonly used method for studying free surface elevation of moving structures is the numerical model based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation watai et al 2011 presented a set of wave run up estimations for a moving large volume semi submersible platform using a cfd algorithm that solved the navier stokes equations by employing a local height function for the free surface displacement matsumto et al 2013 applied the commercial cfd code com flow to investigate wave run up and air gap distributions around a moving large volume semi submersible platform entezam and kazemi 2015 compared the results of the numerical and experimental models demonstrating the ability of flow 3d to acceptably estimate the quantity of wave run up along columns of semi submersible platforms in the investigation of waves with the lower steepness jian et al 2017 used a three dimensional numerical model to study the wave run up caused by a vertical cylinder surging through regular waves and analysed the dependence of the maximum run up ratio on such factors as wave steepness wave scattering and surge amplitude compared with a floating platform a heaving buoy moves and reacts fiercely to waves producing more complex hydrodynamic characteristics moreover the influence of pto damping on a heaving buoy is more obvious than that on the platform therefore it is necessary to investigate the wave run up on the buoy the stability of a coastal structure depends on the wave loads acting on it therefore another significant issue that threatens the safety of the heaving buoy is the wave load acting on it even the overall stability of the wave energy converter device will be affected by the wave load li et al 2014 measured the multi directional focused wave impact forces on a vertical cylinder and studied the effects of wave parameters on the shape of the focused wave and the wave force ning et al 2016 developed a fully non linear numerical wave model to investigate the effects of wave conditions and chamber geometry on the wave force at the front wall of a land fixed oscillating water column owc device chamber chen et al 2016 presented a numerical analysis of the non linear interaction between waves and the movable superstructure of a coastal bridge they found that the bridge deck was most vulnerable to displacement by waves when the bridge was partially submerged owing to the combined effects of the vertical and horizontal wave forces as they can accurately predict wave loads numerical methods provide valuable suggestions for the study of wave loads on the heaving buoy in this study wave run up and wave load on a heaving buoy were studied using the numerical modelling performed by flow 3d software this software is one of the powerful software in the field of hydraulic engineering that works on the basis of the cfd methods the remainder of the paper is organised as follows section 2 details the fundamental theories and the mathematical model of a heaving buoy section 3 describes the numerical model and wave conditions section 4 mainly details the verification of numerical results section 5 discusses the wave field distribution and dynamic responses of the heaving buoy and analyses the run up heights and wave loads on it section 6 summarizes the study with the concluding remarks 2 method 2 1 governing equation in problems related to wave structure interaction waves are defined as the movement of incompressible viscous fluids the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation is used as the governing equation of fluid motion in a turbulent flow assuming that the origin of a right handed cartesian coordinate system o xyz is on the undisturbed free surface the continuity equation and the tensorial form of the rans equation can be written as follows 1 ρ t ρ u i x j 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j u i x i x j ρ u i u j where i and j are the tensor indices i j 1 2 3 and δ i j is the kronecker delta which is an isotropic tensor in the sense that its components are unchanged by a rotation of the frame of reference u and u represent the mean and fluctuating parts of velocity components of the fluid particles g is the acceleration due to gravity p is the pressure term and ρ is the volume fraction averaged density of the form the boussinesq hypothesis which relates the reynolds stresses to the mean velocity gradient is given as follows 3 ρ u i u j μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 ρ k μ t u k x k δ i j the hypothesis was used in the k ε turbulence model furthermore the re normalisation group rng k ε model which is a variant of the k ε model was adopted to account for the effects of smaller scales of motion the rng k ε turbulence model is a three dimensional model that incorporates two additional transport equations one for the turbulent kinetic energy k and one for the turbulence dissipation rate ε the equations are evaluated as a function of both k and ε thus the transport equations for k and ε in the rng k ε model can be described as follows 4 ρ k t ρ k u i x i x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k g b ρ ε y m s k 5 ρ ε t ρ ε u i x i x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j c 1 ε ε k g k c 3 ε g b c 2 ε ρ ε 2 k s ε where μ t is the turbulent viscosity g k indicates the generation of turbulent kinetic energy due to the mean velocity gradient g b is the turbulent kinetic energy term from buoyancy y m represents the contribution of the fluctuating dilation in the compressible turbulence to the overall dissipation rate c 1 ε c 2 ε and c 3 ε are modified constants adapted to the features of the surface boundary layers σ k and σ ε are the turbulent prandtl numbers for k and ε respectively and s k and s ε are undefined terms 2 2 buoy s motion equation compared with other marine structures the heaving buoy wave energy converter poses additional problems owing to the presence of a power pto the single degree of freedom dof heaving buoy model can be simplified to a mass damper system fig 1 shows a damping model for the forced vibration of a buoy in the linearisation of the governing equations and frequency domain analysis the wave load acting on the wet surface of a buoy is divided into three parts they are the excitation forces due to the incident waves radiation forces due to buoy motion and hydrostatic forces connected with the instantaneous position of the buoy with respect to the undisturbed free surface according to falcão 2010 if the position of the buoy s body is defined by a vertical coordinate z with z 0 in calm water the governing equation of its motion is expressed as follows 6 m m z f d f b b z f p t o 7 f b ρ w a t e r g s z where m is the mass of buoy m is the additional mass generated by the buoy moving on the wave f d is the excitation force acting in the vertical direction b is the radiation damping coefficient f p t o is the vertical force due to the pto mechanism f b is the hydrostatic restoring force ρ w a t e r is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration and s is the base area of the cylinder we assumed that the pto force consists of a linear damper and a linear spring therefore we can express the system as f p t o c z k z to convert eq 6 into a linear differential equation we use the following equations 8 z 2 ζ ω 0 z ω 0 2 z f 0 cos ω d t 9 ω 0 2 k m m 10 ζ c 2 k m m where ω 0 is the natural angular frequency in the system without damping f 0 is the maximum wave excitation force ω d is the angular frequency of the wave excitation force ζ is the damping ratio k is the spring coefficient and c is the damping coefficient 2 3 motion coupling for a heaving buoy the wave run up is regarded as the relative elevation based on the coordinates fixed on the buoy and is expressed as 11 η t ξ l i n e r t z t where ξ l i n e r t is the wave surface elevation and its amplitude is expressed by r r is the maximum wave surface height and r h 2 is the relative wave height where h is the incident wave height and z t is the vertical motion at the specific position concerning the run up η t is the total run up and its amplitude is expressed by r r is defined as the amplitude about the maximum wave elevation with respect to the specific position the normalised maximum run up heights can be described as r h 2 according to the coordinates of the still water surface the total wet surface height of the specific position can be expressed as follows 12 χ t η t λ where χ t is the total wetted height at the specific position of the heaving buoy and λ is the draft underwater depth at the initial state of the buoy if χ h h is the height of the buoy it will cause overtopping as λ is constant initially the total wave run up and heave motion are the two key factors affecting the safety performance of the buoy according to lu et al 2020 when floating structures are involved vertical motions heave roll and pitch must be accounted for in order to obtain an accurate estimate of the run up 2 4 elastic springs the general moving objects gmo model in numerical modelling can simulate rigid body motion which is either user prescribed prescribed motion or dynamically coupled with a fluid flow coupled motion note that explicit and implicit gmo methods perform differently for coupled motions the implicit gmo method works for both heavy and light moving objects the explicit gmo method however only works for heavy object problems i e the density of the moving object is higher than the fluid density the gmo model accommodates springs that exert force on objects under coupled motion for a linear spring the elastic restoring force f e is along the length of the spring and satisfies hooke s law of elasticity 13 f e k δ z a linear damping force associated with the spring may also be defined at this point this damping force f d is exerted on a moving object at the attachment point of the spring its line of action is along the spring and its value is proportional to the time rate of the spring length 14 f d c d z d t 2 5 volume of fluid method free surface is one of the liquid s external boundaries a proper definition of the boundary conditions at the free surface is important for accurately capturing the free surface dynamics to this end we employed the volume of fluid vof method in flow 3d it consists of three main components the definition of the vof function a method to solve the vof transport equation and setting the boundary conditions at the free surface fluid configurations were defined in terms of vof function i e f x y z t if f 1 the cell is full of fluid and if f 0 the cell is empty this function represents per unit volume and satisfies the equation 15 f t u f x v f y w f z 0 3 numerical model set up and wave conditions 3 1 geometry of buoy and computational domain the influence of the buoy geometry on the energy capture performance is obvious for surge heave and 3 dof motion the cylinder is the best shape shi et al 2019 therefore for this study we adopted a cylindrical heaving buoy to investigate the interaction between the wave and the wec the buoy geometry in this numerical model was constructed by assembling the solid geometric objects and defining the flow region for the simulation the sub components can also be defined as simple cylinders the numerical flume acts as a constrained channel in which the buoy is placed the schematic of the computational domain is shown in fig 2 where l is the wavelength a wave absorbing layer with a constant damping coefficient of 1 is arranged near the outlet boundary to suppress the numerical reflection the buoy model was placed at a distance that was more than three times the wavelength from the wave maker and more than eight times the wavelength from the wave absorbing layer at the initial state the buoy is centred between the two side wall boundaries and suspended in still water 3 2 boundary conditions fig 2 also illustrates the specific boundary conditions the velocity inlet method based on the linear wave theory was used to generate the linear waves in front of the flume the waves were assumed to come from a flat bottom reservoir which was outside the computational domain therefore the wave and outflow outlets were set as the boundary conditions for both the ends of the flume the wall condition was applied to the bottom boundary and the normal velocity of the fluid on the wall boundary was 0 the top boundary was set at atmospheric pressure because the free surface was the interface between air and water both the kinematic boundary condition and the dynamics boundary condition must be satisfied on the free surface to diminish the wave reflection from the side wall the model used a symmetrical shear stress boundary to realize a zero flow flux the initial condition was treated as still water with no wave or current motion 3 3 grid generation the precision of mesh division has a significant impact on the computational volume and accuracy of the numerical simulation in general a small mesh scale refined can improve the calculation accuracy but increase the calculation time as grid resolution is an essential factor for determining the accuracies of wave run up and wave load a mesh of high quality must be obtained in the fluid domain in the study of mesh generation sensitivity the free surface should be refined appropriately to capture the wave run up in this case the wave conditions of incident wave height h 0 20 m water depth d 1 m and wave period t 2 s were implemented in the regular wave form fig 3 shows the grid distribution of the fluid domain without and with buoy and fig 4 summarizes the results of free surface elevation against time histories for 2 l behind the flow inlet boundary obtained by comparing simulations in three grid sizes in the wave height range the grid independence tests about wave surface were conducted by applying three different mesh sizes and cell size tested in the wave height range were as follows 10 grids 20 grids and 30 grids the size and number of the cells are shown in table 1 the results show that waveforms between 20 and 30 grids are almost the same but those in 20 grids are less time consuming due to less total cell number in computational domain therefore in the given wave height range δ z 0 01 m δ z is cell size in the z direction would be sufficiently refined for simulation the single block mesh may not be efficient to simulate complex geometries because it cannot hold too many cells for scenarios of this nature using multi block structured grids to increase the simulation resolution only in the area of interest while excluding regions with no expected flow is an effective solution therefore as shown in fig 5 the multi block structured grids and a single block mesh around the buoy are provided to reasonably describe the shape of the buoy the buoy was encapsulated in three different total mesh numbers mesh numbers tested in the numerical model were shown in table 2 the grid distribution of the fluid domain with buoy is shown in fig 3 b and flow geometry is then embedded in the computational grid by the preprocessor using a technique called fractional area volume obstacle representation favor it is obvious that the favorized view of the embedded geometry can reasonably describe the shape of the buoy fig 6 compares the ability to capture the buoy s heave motion by adopting a constant wave condition under different mesh size clearly the results showed a negligible difference in the mesh size of 0 01 and 0 005 cm which indicates that the mesh size of 0 01 cm has sufficiently high simulation resolution therefore the recommended grid resolution around the buoy is set as δ x l 100 and δ z h 20 3 4 wave conditions the values of wave height and period were selected in the range of conditions for the physical test for the heaving buoy the wave run up depends on the incident wave properties the buoy parameters themselves and the coupling between the incident wave and the buoy the incident wave properties can directly represent the non linearity of a regular wave train hence water depth d and wave height h are the hydrodynamic parameters that must be considered when studying the wave run up for the buoy parameters the equivalent radius a and the density of the buoy ρ are two important structural parameters therefore four different parameters were calculated to investigate the distribution of wave run up around the buoy the wave loads on the buoy were examined for these two aspects wave height and radius through the use of dimensionless parameters i e wave steepness k a and wave scattering parameter k a table 3 lists the specific parameter for each test where the period is constant i e t 2 s the spring coefficient k and damping coefficient c also were chosen to study the wave run up and the wave loads on the heaving buoy with pto the specific damping parameters used in the numerical model are listed in table 4 and case1 was used as the wave condition the 14 virtual run up measurement points shown in fig 7 a were implemented in the model to measure the variation of wave run up around the buoy the radial distances between the measurement points and the centre of the buoy are displayed in table 5 and the distance is expressed by r to study the pressure distribution on the bottom of the buoy 11 virtual pressure measuring points as shown in fig 7 b were selected according to symmetry the semi circular arc m2 s2 was defined as the outer edge and the radial distance between these measurement points and the centre of the buoy was a the semi circular arc m1 s1 was defined as the inner edge and the radial distance between these measurement points and the centre of the buoy was a 2 the angles α defined in fig 7 is the degree in the x direction which is 0 towards the wave 45 90 135 and 180 note that the virtual run up measurement points around the buoy were implemented within approximately 3 mm from the standard position all incident waves were long crested and propagated in the positive x direction 4 numerical model verification 4 1 model setup prior to executing the numerical model the accuracy of the numerical model must be verified and the numerical results must be compared with available experimental data therefore a physical model test was carried out to obtain the hydrodynamic characteristics around a cylindrical buoy under free heave motion the test was executed at the shandong provincial key laboratory of ocean engineering the dimensions of the wave basin are 60 m 36 m 1 5 m l w h with the heaving buoy set at a distance of 25 m from the wave maker fig 8 is the schematic of the model setup in which the buoy retains only free heave motion and the other five dofs i e surge pitch sway yaw and rolling are fixed both the radius and height of the cylinder buoy are 0 4 m and the draft of the buoy with a density of 300 kg m3 is 0 12 m the buoy s motion is measured by an ndi optotrak certus 3d investigator and the whole experiment process was recorded with an hd camera 4 2 numerical results validation 4 2 1 comparison of buoy s motion displacement in numerical and experimental models to verify the model of the buoy s motion every test condition was taking twice to ensure the accuracy in the experiment the test data began to be collected after the buoy s motion reached steady state to avoid the start up impact after 5 waves passed through the buoy in general the whole comparative curves of the experimental data and the computational result are shown in fig 9 it was found that the heaving displacements between the experimental data generated by the ndi and the numerical results under case 3 with a wave height of 0 2 m are evidently close and the average relative error is 6 68 therefore the numerical model can accurately simulate the motion of the buoy 4 2 2 comparison of total wetted height between numerical and experimental models the maximum total wetted height χ at a1 with different wave periods was calculated and compared with the experimental data in fig 10 the wave period t was varied from 1 4 s to 2 0 s in intervals of 0 2 s while the other wave parameters were consistent with case 3 the maximum total wetted height at a1 was observed with an hd camera the scale relationship with buoy height was used to obtain the actual experimental data given the error accumulation in the experimental equipment only eight waves in the middle of each wave train were employed to obtain the maximum total wetted height in all tests of four different wave periods the maximum total wetted heights obtained using this numerical model were in good agreement with the experimental data and the minimum relative error occurred at t 2 s 4 2 3 comparison wave profile characteristics in numerical and experimental models fig 11 illustrates the wave profile characteristics around the buoy by comparing the snapshots of the experimental and numerical results at various instants fig 11 a is a snapshot of the maximum free surface elevation at a1 for the model experiment and numerical results respectively a large annular water wave is generated in front of the buoy as shown in fig 11 b when the buoy moves to its highest position the free surface elevation at a1 dropped by more than half most of the wave surface gathers on both sides of the buoy fig 11 c shows the generation of a whirlpool in front of the buoy the instant the buoy moves to its lowest position thus we demonstrated the effectiveness of the numerical model in revealing the fluid characteristics and the inherent mechanism of wave run up on the heaving buoy 5 results and discussion 5 1 wave field distribution around heaving buoy comparisons of the wave field distributions along the direction of the incident wave rows a b and c in fig 7 a between the heaving and fixed buoys in case 3 are shown in fig 12 a and b the relative wave height values next to the heaving buoy are smaller than that of the fixed buoy which indicates that the heaving buoys have a small effect on the surrounding wave fields in principle buoy motion should cause higher wave field disorderliness however this result is substantially the same as those of liu et al 2017 that is the heaving buoys have less effect on the surrounding wave fields than the fixed buoys therefore the heaving buoys have a better passing capability for incident regular waves that is the heave motion of the buoy has a strong wave following property in fig 13 the variation of normalised run up heights around the cylinder for regular waves was recorded at five different angles of attack by comparing the heaving buoy and monopole support structure lin et al 2017 with respect to the wave condition k a 0 1 we found that the maximum run up height for the monopole support structure occurs at 0 however for the heaving buoy the position appears at 180 the results also indicate that the style of structure plays a dominant role in the difference between the normalised run up heights especially near the front of the cylinder angles between 0 and 90 we suppose that heave motion takes up a portion of the wave energy compared to a fixed structure preventing the wave kinematics in front of the buoy from converting the total energy into the potential energy of the wave run up furthermore the normalised run up heights behind the cylinder angles between 135 and 180 are almost equal to one another which indicates that the heave motion only has a small effect on the energy transfer behind the cylindrical buoy 5 2 dynamic responses of heaving buoy to regular waves the bottom of the heaving buoy may experience uneven force under the action of wave impact which would put the buoy at risk of overturning therefore it is important to explore the pressure and flow field distribution at different buoy positions similarly through the analysis of case 3 the distributions of relative pressure p p the ratio of maximum average pressure p to initial pressure p on the bottom of the buoy are presented in fig 14 the relative pressure increases closer to the outer edge arc m2 s2 and decreases near the axis of α 90 the maximum relative pressure appears at s2 and exceeds the initial pressure by 47 however the minimum pressure value appears at o and increases by 8 5 over the initial pressure this can be attributed to the fact that the heave motion greatly weakens the wave impact on both sides of the buoy at α 90 and the kinetic energy is mainly concentrated on the wave ward side at α 0 and leeward side at α 180 fig 15 a d illustrate the two dimensional process of the wave buoy coupling motion for case 3 as the wave approaches the buoy the water particles in the wave crest approach the buoy at high speeds and run up to the wave ward side of the buoy the buoy rapidly moves up with the thrust of the wave fig 15 a and b are the instances when the buoy moves upward from the static position to the highest position the water flow on the wave ward and leeward sides of the buoy becomes turbulent which explains why kinetic energy is mainly concentrated in these two positions fig 15 b d are the instants when the buoy moves downward from the highest position to the lowest position further the velocity distribution near the centre is less influenced when compared with the other positions the velocity contours around the buoy respond to the locations of maximum pressure hence the pressure distribution is easily revealed by the flow field around the buoy 5 3 distributions of wave run up heights around buoy 5 3 1 effect of damping parameters on wave run up fig 16 illustrates the wave run up distribution around the buoy with different damping parameters under the same wave case case1 as indicated in the figure the normalised run up heights in front of the buoy angles between 0 and 90 increase with increasing damping coefficient however the variation curve behind the buoy angles between 135 and 180 is the opposite the variation laws for the spring coefficient which has little effect on the wave run up in front of the buoy are the opposite the results show that the damping coefficient has a significant effect on the wave run up in front of the buoy and it will lead to an increase of the wave run up behind the buoy with the increase of the spring coefficient it is evident that the damping and spring coefficients play different roles in the wave energy capture characteristics the reason for the different contributions to the wave run up is that the damping coefficient and the spring coefficient are respectively related to the vertical velocity and displacement of the heaving buoy 5 3 2 effect of hydraulic parameters on the wave run up for a constant period the water depth and wave height remain the main hydrodynamic parameters affecting the heave motion of the buoy therefore effects on the wave run up around the buoy were investigated and are presented in fig 17 the results in fig 17 a show that when the water depth increases from 0 8 m to 1 4 m the normalised maximum run up heights around the buoy varies within 0 1 the movement of the free water surface is not affected by the water depth when it is much deeper than the draft of the buoy as indicated in fig 17 b the wave run ups in the front and rear sides of the buoy obey different variation laws when the wave height increases from 0 12 m to 0 24 m the wave run up in front of the buoy first increases and then decreases with increase in wave height however the wave run up behind the buoy increases with wave height the reason for this trend is the increase of maximum vertical displacement of the buoy with increase in wave height which consumes most of the wave energy whereas the heave motion has a weaker effect on the energy transfer behind the buoy meanwhile the influence of wave height on the free surface height in front of the buoy is much smaller than the heaving displacement of the buoy which causes the wave run up in front of the buoy to first increase and then decrease 5 3 3 effect of structural parameters on the wave run up the radius and density of the buoy are two important structural parameters for determining the wave run up around the buoy the relationship between the maximum normalised run up height and radius is discussed in fig 18 a according to the figure the wave run up on both sides of the buoy α 90 is hardly affected by the buoy radius whereas the maximum normalised run up heights increase with the increase of the buoy radius in other angles for a constant wave condition when the buoy radius increases by 67 the normalised maximum run up heights in the wave ward and leeward sides of buoy increase by approximately 23 according to shi et al 2019 for the heave motion the capture width ratio increases with increasing radius at low wave frequencies ω 3 1 rad s this indicates that the wave energy acting on the buoy increases with the radius the relationship between maximum normalised run up heights and the density of buoy ρ is discussed in fig 18 b the results show that density had little effect on the wave run up around the buoy according to ao et al 2018 the heave motion response decreases with increasing buoy mass at low wave frequencies ω 3 1 rad s while the free surface height around the heaving buoy increases with increasing density this trend can be attributed to the fact that the difference in wave run ups around the buoy with density changes can be eliminated by the vector sum of displacement and wave surface height 5 4 maximum wave loads on buoy 5 4 1 effect of damping parameters on maximum wave load the normalised maximum horizontal and vertical wave loads impacting the buoy under different damping parameters are shown in fig 19 where f x and f z are the maximum horizontal and vertical wave loads respectively and g ρ g s h is the gravitational pull of the buoy we found that the normalised value of f x ρ g s h and f z ρ g s h increase with increase of the damping coefficient c for a constant wave case 1 h 0 12 m when damping coefficient increases from 0 to 1 000 n s m the normalised maximum horizontal and vertical loads increase by 26 7 and 13 4 respectively when the spring coefficient increases from 0 to 2 000 kg s2 the normalised maximum horizontal and vertical wave loads decrease by 9 9 and 1 6 respectively the results indicate that the influence of the damping coefficient on the wave loads is much greater than that of the spring coefficient and the spring coefficient has little effect on the horizontal wave loads impacting the buoy the reason for this trend is the increase in damping coefficient which leads to increase of resistance to heaving motion which in turn increases the intensity of coupling between the wave and the buoy by contrast the increase of the spring coefficient offers a higher restoring force for the heaving motion resulting in the maximum wave load on the buoy exhibiting a downward trend 5 4 2 effect of wave steepness parameter on maximum wave load fig 20 indicates the relationship between the wave steepness parameter k a and the normalised maximum wave loads on the buoy we observed that the normalised maximum horizontal and vertical wave loads increase by 128 and 6 7 respectively as the wave steepness increases from 0 072 to 0 144 the results indicate that the maximum wave loads impacting the buoy increase with the increase of wave steepness in this case the maximum horizontal wave load is mainly subjected to the variation of wave steepness for the heaving buoy which is the same as the fixed structures made by lin et al 2017 a plausible explanation of this phenomenon is that the wave energy is proportional to the square of the wave height and therefore the wave height is the main factor in determining the stability of the fixed milanian et al 2016 or floating structures correspondingly the wave steepness is also the main parameter required to increase the wave loads on the buoy especially the wave loads in the horizontal direction 5 4 3 effect of wave scattering parameter on maximum wave load fig 21 shows the variation of normalised maximum wave loads with wave scattering parameter k a it can be observed that when the wave scattering parameter increases from 0 164 to 0 410 the normalised maximum horizontal and vertical wave loads decrease by 14 7 and 1 1 respectively the gravitational force of the buoy increases with the increase of k a the range of wave force acting on the buoy with the increase of radius is much smaller than that of the gravitational force of the buoy which leads to the decrease of normalised maximum wave loads with the increase of k a the results once again indicate that the normalised maximum vertical wave load is less affected by heaving motion as long as the buoy does not leave the wave surface 6 conclusions in this study a three dimensional numerical wave model was established to simulate the wave run up heights and wave loads on a heaving buoy wave energy converter the model was tested and the consistency of the numerical results was verified the most important findings of the numerical analysis and physical model experiments are summarised as follows 1 the coupling motion of the wave and the buoy leads to better passing ability for the incident regular wave thus eliminating the wave field disorder around the buoy hence a single free heaving buoy has less effect on the surrounding wave fields than the fixed buoy for a constant wave condition k a 0 1 the wave run up in front of the heaving buoy is much less than that of the fixed foundation 2 for the heaving buoy the kinetic energy is mainly concentrated in wave ward and leeward sides of the buoy which causes the maximum pressure and flow velocity on the bottom of the buoy to appear in these two positions among them the maximum and minimum pressure increased by 47 and 8 5 over the initial pressure respectively 3 for the heaving buoy with pto the damping coefficient has greater influence on the maximum run up heights in front of the buoy by contrast the spring coefficient has a significant effect on the maximum run up heights behind the buoy generally the maximum wave loads increase with the increase of the damping coefficient whereas the spring coefficient has a weak influence on the maximum wave loads especially on the maximum horizontal wave loads 4 for the heaving buoy without pto the wave height and the buoy radius are the main parameters affecting the distribution of maximum normalised run up heights around the buoy the water depth and the buoy density have less influence the maximum wave loads on the heaving buoy increase with the increase of wave steepness when the wave steepness doubles the normalised maximum horizontal wave loads increase by 128 the maximum horizontal wave load decreases with the increase of the wave scattering

20965,the effect of non linear phenomenon such as wave run up and wave impact on the heaving buoy wave energy converter may lead to its efficiency decrease and overtopping in this study a hydrodynamic simulation of wave run up heights and maximum wave loads on a cylindrical heaving buoy is constructed and preliminarily analysed using the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations the numerical results show that kinetic energy is mainly concentrated in the wave ward and leeward sides of the buoy further the maximum pressure at the bottom of the buoy occurs on the leeward side when the wave hits the buoy increasing by 47 over the initial pressure and 32 over the maximum pressure at the centre of the buoy for a heaving buoy with the power take off mechanism pto the damping coefficient is the main parameter that affects the wave run up and wave loads by contrast for a heaving buoy without pto the wave height and the radius of the buoy are the main parameter the accuracy of the numerical results is verified through model tests of the motion response of the buoy and the wave surface characteristics around it the computational method can guide future buoy designs in terms of safety and reliability keywords heaving buoy wave run up wave load wave filed impact pressure 1 introduction as traditional energy sources continue to get depleted at an alarming rate atmospheric pollution worsens and the demand for energy increases wave energy as a clean and sustainable energy source has become the focus of research because of the comparative ease in developing wave energy and the simple acquisition method involved the utilisation of wave energy by human beings can be traced back to more than two centuries ago hundreds of wave energy converters wecs have been developed since falcão 2010 truong and ahn 2014 compared with other devices oscillating buoy wecs are more flexible and efficient shi et al 2016 optimisation of the heaving buoy size and improvement of its conversion efficiency have been the main focus of research attention hals et al 2011 li and yu 2012 zhang and george 2015 xiao et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 however the influence of non linear phenomenon such as wave run up wave impact and overtopping on the buoy has not been studied a buoy is directly exposed to the diverse sea conditions non linear phenomena at rough seas including wave run up and impingement cause overturning plastic deformation and fatigue failure of the heaving buoy which in turn affect its working performance safety and lifespan therefore the non linear phenomena involved in the interaction between buoys and waves must be studied further previous studies have employed experimental and numerical methods to study free surface elevation however these studies mainly focused on stationary objects li et al 2012 performed a wave basin experiment to investigate the interactions between multi directional focused waves and a vertical bottom mounted cylinder they also studied the wave run up on the cylinder milanian et al 2016 integrated computer aided design cad and computational fluid dynamics cfd to investigate the effects of berm width wave height and wave period on the wave run up over berm breakwaters ning et al 2017 investigated the extreme wave run up on a vertical seawall and to that end proposed an extended numerical model that could accurately predict extreme wave run ups zhang and teng 2017 examined the influence of wave non linearity on wave run up around a vertical circular cylinder using dimensionless parameters however the motion coupling between waves and structures is more intense for floating structures such as heaving buoys and semi submersible platforms therefore capturing the parameters of the free surface of such structures is more difficult in addition to experimental models xiao et al 2014 lu et al 2020 and theoretical solutions izadparast and niedzwecki 2010 the most commonly used method for studying free surface elevation of moving structures is the numerical model based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation watai et al 2011 presented a set of wave run up estimations for a moving large volume semi submersible platform using a cfd algorithm that solved the navier stokes equations by employing a local height function for the free surface displacement matsumto et al 2013 applied the commercial cfd code com flow to investigate wave run up and air gap distributions around a moving large volume semi submersible platform entezam and kazemi 2015 compared the results of the numerical and experimental models demonstrating the ability of flow 3d to acceptably estimate the quantity of wave run up along columns of semi submersible platforms in the investigation of waves with the lower steepness jian et al 2017 used a three dimensional numerical model to study the wave run up caused by a vertical cylinder surging through regular waves and analysed the dependence of the maximum run up ratio on such factors as wave steepness wave scattering and surge amplitude compared with a floating platform a heaving buoy moves and reacts fiercely to waves producing more complex hydrodynamic characteristics moreover the influence of pto damping on a heaving buoy is more obvious than that on the platform therefore it is necessary to investigate the wave run up on the buoy the stability of a coastal structure depends on the wave loads acting on it therefore another significant issue that threatens the safety of the heaving buoy is the wave load acting on it even the overall stability of the wave energy converter device will be affected by the wave load li et al 2014 measured the multi directional focused wave impact forces on a vertical cylinder and studied the effects of wave parameters on the shape of the focused wave and the wave force ning et al 2016 developed a fully non linear numerical wave model to investigate the effects of wave conditions and chamber geometry on the wave force at the front wall of a land fixed oscillating water column owc device chamber chen et al 2016 presented a numerical analysis of the non linear interaction between waves and the movable superstructure of a coastal bridge they found that the bridge deck was most vulnerable to displacement by waves when the bridge was partially submerged owing to the combined effects of the vertical and horizontal wave forces as they can accurately predict wave loads numerical methods provide valuable suggestions for the study of wave loads on the heaving buoy in this study wave run up and wave load on a heaving buoy were studied using the numerical modelling performed by flow 3d software this software is one of the powerful software in the field of hydraulic engineering that works on the basis of the cfd methods the remainder of the paper is organised as follows section 2 details the fundamental theories and the mathematical model of a heaving buoy section 3 describes the numerical model and wave conditions section 4 mainly details the verification of numerical results section 5 discusses the wave field distribution and dynamic responses of the heaving buoy and analyses the run up heights and wave loads on it section 6 summarizes the study with the concluding remarks 2 method 2 1 governing equation in problems related to wave structure interaction waves are defined as the movement of incompressible viscous fluids the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation is used as the governing equation of fluid motion in a turbulent flow assuming that the origin of a right handed cartesian coordinate system o xyz is on the undisturbed free surface the continuity equation and the tensorial form of the rans equation can be written as follows 1 ρ t ρ u i x j 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j u i x i x j ρ u i u j where i and j are the tensor indices i j 1 2 3 and δ i j is the kronecker delta which is an isotropic tensor in the sense that its components are unchanged by a rotation of the frame of reference u and u represent the mean and fluctuating parts of velocity components of the fluid particles g is the acceleration due to gravity p is the pressure term and ρ is the volume fraction averaged density of the form the boussinesq hypothesis which relates the reynolds stresses to the mean velocity gradient is given as follows 3 ρ u i u j μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 ρ k μ t u k x k δ i j the hypothesis was used in the k ε turbulence model furthermore the re normalisation group rng k ε model which is a variant of the k ε model was adopted to account for the effects of smaller scales of motion the rng k ε turbulence model is a three dimensional model that incorporates two additional transport equations one for the turbulent kinetic energy k and one for the turbulence dissipation rate ε the equations are evaluated as a function of both k and ε thus the transport equations for k and ε in the rng k ε model can be described as follows 4 ρ k t ρ k u i x i x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k g b ρ ε y m s k 5 ρ ε t ρ ε u i x i x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j c 1 ε ε k g k c 3 ε g b c 2 ε ρ ε 2 k s ε where μ t is the turbulent viscosity g k indicates the generation of turbulent kinetic energy due to the mean velocity gradient g b is the turbulent kinetic energy term from buoyancy y m represents the contribution of the fluctuating dilation in the compressible turbulence to the overall dissipation rate c 1 ε c 2 ε and c 3 ε are modified constants adapted to the features of the surface boundary layers σ k and σ ε are the turbulent prandtl numbers for k and ε respectively and s k and s ε are undefined terms 2 2 buoy s motion equation compared with other marine structures the heaving buoy wave energy converter poses additional problems owing to the presence of a power pto the single degree of freedom dof heaving buoy model can be simplified to a mass damper system fig 1 shows a damping model for the forced vibration of a buoy in the linearisation of the governing equations and frequency domain analysis the wave load acting on the wet surface of a buoy is divided into three parts they are the excitation forces due to the incident waves radiation forces due to buoy motion and hydrostatic forces connected with the instantaneous position of the buoy with respect to the undisturbed free surface according to falcão 2010 if the position of the buoy s body is defined by a vertical coordinate z with z 0 in calm water the governing equation of its motion is expressed as follows 6 m m z f d f b b z f p t o 7 f b ρ w a t e r g s z where m is the mass of buoy m is the additional mass generated by the buoy moving on the wave f d is the excitation force acting in the vertical direction b is the radiation damping coefficient f p t o is the vertical force due to the pto mechanism f b is the hydrostatic restoring force ρ w a t e r is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration and s is the base area of the cylinder we assumed that the pto force consists of a linear damper and a linear spring therefore we can express the system as f p t o c z k z to convert eq 6 into a linear differential equation we use the following equations 8 z 2 ζ ω 0 z ω 0 2 z f 0 cos ω d t 9 ω 0 2 k m m 10 ζ c 2 k m m where ω 0 is the natural angular frequency in the system without damping f 0 is the maximum wave excitation force ω d is the angular frequency of the wave excitation force ζ is the damping ratio k is the spring coefficient and c is the damping coefficient 2 3 motion coupling for a heaving buoy the wave run up is regarded as the relative elevation based on the coordinates fixed on the buoy and is expressed as 11 η t ξ l i n e r t z t where ξ l i n e r t is the wave surface elevation and its amplitude is expressed by r r is the maximum wave surface height and r h 2 is the relative wave height where h is the incident wave height and z t is the vertical motion at the specific position concerning the run up η t is the total run up and its amplitude is expressed by r r is defined as the amplitude about the maximum wave elevation with respect to the specific position the normalised maximum run up heights can be described as r h 2 according to the coordinates of the still water surface the total wet surface height of the specific position can be expressed as follows 12 χ t η t λ where χ t is the total wetted height at the specific position of the heaving buoy and λ is the draft underwater depth at the initial state of the buoy if χ h h is the height of the buoy it will cause overtopping as λ is constant initially the total wave run up and heave motion are the two key factors affecting the safety performance of the buoy according to lu et al 2020 when floating structures are involved vertical motions heave roll and pitch must be accounted for in order to obtain an accurate estimate of the run up 2 4 elastic springs the general moving objects gmo model in numerical modelling can simulate rigid body motion which is either user prescribed prescribed motion or dynamically coupled with a fluid flow coupled motion note that explicit and implicit gmo methods perform differently for coupled motions the implicit gmo method works for both heavy and light moving objects the explicit gmo method however only works for heavy object problems i e the density of the moving object is higher than the fluid density the gmo model accommodates springs that exert force on objects under coupled motion for a linear spring the elastic restoring force f e is along the length of the spring and satisfies hooke s law of elasticity 13 f e k δ z a linear damping force associated with the spring may also be defined at this point this damping force f d is exerted on a moving object at the attachment point of the spring its line of action is along the spring and its value is proportional to the time rate of the spring length 14 f d c d z d t 2 5 volume of fluid method free surface is one of the liquid s external boundaries a proper definition of the boundary conditions at the free surface is important for accurately capturing the free surface dynamics to this end we employed the volume of fluid vof method in flow 3d it consists of three main components the definition of the vof function a method to solve the vof transport equation and setting the boundary conditions at the free surface fluid configurations were defined in terms of vof function i e f x y z t if f 1 the cell is full of fluid and if f 0 the cell is empty this function represents per unit volume and satisfies the equation 15 f t u f x v f y w f z 0 3 numerical model set up and wave conditions 3 1 geometry of buoy and computational domain the influence of the buoy geometry on the energy capture performance is obvious for surge heave and 3 dof motion the cylinder is the best shape shi et al 2019 therefore for this study we adopted a cylindrical heaving buoy to investigate the interaction between the wave and the wec the buoy geometry in this numerical model was constructed by assembling the solid geometric objects and defining the flow region for the simulation the sub components can also be defined as simple cylinders the numerical flume acts as a constrained channel in which the buoy is placed the schematic of the computational domain is shown in fig 2 where l is the wavelength a wave absorbing layer with a constant damping coefficient of 1 is arranged near the outlet boundary to suppress the numerical reflection the buoy model was placed at a distance that was more than three times the wavelength from the wave maker and more than eight times the wavelength from the wave absorbing layer at the initial state the buoy is centred between the two side wall boundaries and suspended in still water 3 2 boundary conditions fig 2 also illustrates the specific boundary conditions the velocity inlet method based on the linear wave theory was used to generate the linear waves in front of the flume the waves were assumed to come from a flat bottom reservoir which was outside the computational domain therefore the wave and outflow outlets were set as the boundary conditions for both the ends of the flume the wall condition was applied to the bottom boundary and the normal velocity of the fluid on the wall boundary was 0 the top boundary was set at atmospheric pressure because the free surface was the interface between air and water both the kinematic boundary condition and the dynamics boundary condition must be satisfied on the free surface to diminish the wave reflection from the side wall the model used a symmetrical shear stress boundary to realize a zero flow flux the initial condition was treated as still water with no wave or current motion 3 3 grid generation the precision of mesh division has a significant impact on the computational volume and accuracy of the numerical simulation in general a small mesh scale refined can improve the calculation accuracy but increase the calculation time as grid resolution is an essential factor for determining the accuracies of wave run up and wave load a mesh of high quality must be obtained in the fluid domain in the study of mesh generation sensitivity the free surface should be refined appropriately to capture the wave run up in this case the wave conditions of incident wave height h 0 20 m water depth d 1 m and wave period t 2 s were implemented in the regular wave form fig 3 shows the grid distribution of the fluid domain without and with buoy and fig 4 summarizes the results of free surface elevation against time histories for 2 l behind the flow inlet boundary obtained by comparing simulations in three grid sizes in the wave height range the grid independence tests about wave surface were conducted by applying three different mesh sizes and cell size tested in the wave height range were as follows 10 grids 20 grids and 30 grids the size and number of the cells are shown in table 1 the results show that waveforms between 20 and 30 grids are almost the same but those in 20 grids are less time consuming due to less total cell number in computational domain therefore in the given wave height range δ z 0 01 m δ z is cell size in the z direction would be sufficiently refined for simulation the single block mesh may not be efficient to simulate complex geometries because it cannot hold too many cells for scenarios of this nature using multi block structured grids to increase the simulation resolution only in the area of interest while excluding regions with no expected flow is an effective solution therefore as shown in fig 5 the multi block structured grids and a single block mesh around the buoy are provided to reasonably describe the shape of the buoy the buoy was encapsulated in three different total mesh numbers mesh numbers tested in the numerical model were shown in table 2 the grid distribution of the fluid domain with buoy is shown in fig 3 b and flow geometry is then embedded in the computational grid by the preprocessor using a technique called fractional area volume obstacle representation favor it is obvious that the favorized view of the embedded geometry can reasonably describe the shape of the buoy fig 6 compares the ability to capture the buoy s heave motion by adopting a constant wave condition under different mesh size clearly the results showed a negligible difference in the mesh size of 0 01 and 0 005 cm which indicates that the mesh size of 0 01 cm has sufficiently high simulation resolution therefore the recommended grid resolution around the buoy is set as δ x l 100 and δ z h 20 3 4 wave conditions the values of wave height and period were selected in the range of conditions for the physical test for the heaving buoy the wave run up depends on the incident wave properties the buoy parameters themselves and the coupling between the incident wave and the buoy the incident wave properties can directly represent the non linearity of a regular wave train hence water depth d and wave height h are the hydrodynamic parameters that must be considered when studying the wave run up for the buoy parameters the equivalent radius a and the density of the buoy ρ are two important structural parameters therefore four different parameters were calculated to investigate the distribution of wave run up around the buoy the wave loads on the buoy were examined for these two aspects wave height and radius through the use of dimensionless parameters i e wave steepness k a and wave scattering parameter k a table 3 lists the specific parameter for each test where the period is constant i e t 2 s the spring coefficient k and damping coefficient c also were chosen to study the wave run up and the wave loads on the heaving buoy with pto the specific damping parameters used in the numerical model are listed in table 4 and case1 was used as the wave condition the 14 virtual run up measurement points shown in fig 7 a were implemented in the model to measure the variation of wave run up around the buoy the radial distances between the measurement points and the centre of the buoy are displayed in table 5 and the distance is expressed by r to study the pressure distribution on the bottom of the buoy 11 virtual pressure measuring points as shown in fig 7 b were selected according to symmetry the semi circular arc m2 s2 was defined as the outer edge and the radial distance between these measurement points and the centre of the buoy was a the semi circular arc m1 s1 was defined as the inner edge and the radial distance between these measurement points and the centre of the buoy was a 2 the angles α defined in fig 7 is the degree in the x direction which is 0 towards the wave 45 90 135 and 180 note that the virtual run up measurement points around the buoy were implemented within approximately 3 mm from the standard position all incident waves were long crested and propagated in the positive x direction 4 numerical model verification 4 1 model setup prior to executing the numerical model the accuracy of the numerical model must be verified and the numerical results must be compared with available experimental data therefore a physical model test was carried out to obtain the hydrodynamic characteristics around a cylindrical buoy under free heave motion the test was executed at the shandong provincial key laboratory of ocean engineering the dimensions of the wave basin are 60 m 36 m 1 5 m l w h with the heaving buoy set at a distance of 25 m from the wave maker fig 8 is the schematic of the model setup in which the buoy retains only free heave motion and the other five dofs i e surge pitch sway yaw and rolling are fixed both the radius and height of the cylinder buoy are 0 4 m and the draft of the buoy with a density of 300 kg m3 is 0 12 m the buoy s motion is measured by an ndi optotrak certus 3d investigator and the whole experiment process was recorded with an hd camera 4 2 numerical results validation 4 2 1 comparison of buoy s motion displacement in numerical and experimental models to verify the model of the buoy s motion every test condition was taking twice to ensure the accuracy in the experiment the test data began to be collected after the buoy s motion reached steady state to avoid the start up impact after 5 waves passed through the buoy in general the whole comparative curves of the experimental data and the computational result are shown in fig 9 it was found that the heaving displacements between the experimental data generated by the ndi and the numerical results under case 3 with a wave height of 0 2 m are evidently close and the average relative error is 6 68 therefore the numerical model can accurately simulate the motion of the buoy 4 2 2 comparison of total wetted height between numerical and experimental models the maximum total wetted height χ at a1 with different wave periods was calculated and compared with the experimental data in fig 10 the wave period t was varied from 1 4 s to 2 0 s in intervals of 0 2 s while the other wave parameters were consistent with case 3 the maximum total wetted height at a1 was observed with an hd camera the scale relationship with buoy height was used to obtain the actual experimental data given the error accumulation in the experimental equipment only eight waves in the middle of each wave train were employed to obtain the maximum total wetted height in all tests of four different wave periods the maximum total wetted heights obtained using this numerical model were in good agreement with the experimental data and the minimum relative error occurred at t 2 s 4 2 3 comparison wave profile characteristics in numerical and experimental models fig 11 illustrates the wave profile characteristics around the buoy by comparing the snapshots of the experimental and numerical results at various instants fig 11 a is a snapshot of the maximum free surface elevation at a1 for the model experiment and numerical results respectively a large annular water wave is generated in front of the buoy as shown in fig 11 b when the buoy moves to its highest position the free surface elevation at a1 dropped by more than half most of the wave surface gathers on both sides of the buoy fig 11 c shows the generation of a whirlpool in front of the buoy the instant the buoy moves to its lowest position thus we demonstrated the effectiveness of the numerical model in revealing the fluid characteristics and the inherent mechanism of wave run up on the heaving buoy 5 results and discussion 5 1 wave field distribution around heaving buoy comparisons of the wave field distributions along the direction of the incident wave rows a b and c in fig 7 a between the heaving and fixed buoys in case 3 are shown in fig 12 a and b the relative wave height values next to the heaving buoy are smaller than that of the fixed buoy which indicates that the heaving buoys have a small effect on the surrounding wave fields in principle buoy motion should cause higher wave field disorderliness however this result is substantially the same as those of liu et al 2017 that is the heaving buoys have less effect on the surrounding wave fields than the fixed buoys therefore the heaving buoys have a better passing capability for incident regular waves that is the heave motion of the buoy has a strong wave following property in fig 13 the variation of normalised run up heights around the cylinder for regular waves was recorded at five different angles of attack by comparing the heaving buoy and monopole support structure lin et al 2017 with respect to the wave condition k a 0 1 we found that the maximum run up height for the monopole support structure occurs at 0 however for the heaving buoy the position appears at 180 the results also indicate that the style of structure plays a dominant role in the difference between the normalised run up heights especially near the front of the cylinder angles between 0 and 90 we suppose that heave motion takes up a portion of the wave energy compared to a fixed structure preventing the wave kinematics in front of the buoy from converting the total energy into the potential energy of the wave run up furthermore the normalised run up heights behind the cylinder angles between 135 and 180 are almost equal to one another which indicates that the heave motion only has a small effect on the energy transfer behind the cylindrical buoy 5 2 dynamic responses of heaving buoy to regular waves the bottom of the heaving buoy may experience uneven force under the action of wave impact which would put the buoy at risk of overturning therefore it is important to explore the pressure and flow field distribution at different buoy positions similarly through the analysis of case 3 the distributions of relative pressure p p the ratio of maximum average pressure p to initial pressure p on the bottom of the buoy are presented in fig 14 the relative pressure increases closer to the outer edge arc m2 s2 and decreases near the axis of α 90 the maximum relative pressure appears at s2 and exceeds the initial pressure by 47 however the minimum pressure value appears at o and increases by 8 5 over the initial pressure this can be attributed to the fact that the heave motion greatly weakens the wave impact on both sides of the buoy at α 90 and the kinetic energy is mainly concentrated on the wave ward side at α 0 and leeward side at α 180 fig 15 a d illustrate the two dimensional process of the wave buoy coupling motion for case 3 as the wave approaches the buoy the water particles in the wave crest approach the buoy at high speeds and run up to the wave ward side of the buoy the buoy rapidly moves up with the thrust of the wave fig 15 a and b are the instances when the buoy moves upward from the static position to the highest position the water flow on the wave ward and leeward sides of the buoy becomes turbulent which explains why kinetic energy is mainly concentrated in these two positions fig 15 b d are the instants when the buoy moves downward from the highest position to the lowest position further the velocity distribution near the centre is less influenced when compared with the other positions the velocity contours around the buoy respond to the locations of maximum pressure hence the pressure distribution is easily revealed by the flow field around the buoy 5 3 distributions of wave run up heights around buoy 5 3 1 effect of damping parameters on wave run up fig 16 illustrates the wave run up distribution around the buoy with different damping parameters under the same wave case case1 as indicated in the figure the normalised run up heights in front of the buoy angles between 0 and 90 increase with increasing damping coefficient however the variation curve behind the buoy angles between 135 and 180 is the opposite the variation laws for the spring coefficient which has little effect on the wave run up in front of the buoy are the opposite the results show that the damping coefficient has a significant effect on the wave run up in front of the buoy and it will lead to an increase of the wave run up behind the buoy with the increase of the spring coefficient it is evident that the damping and spring coefficients play different roles in the wave energy capture characteristics the reason for the different contributions to the wave run up is that the damping coefficient and the spring coefficient are respectively related to the vertical velocity and displacement of the heaving buoy 5 3 2 effect of hydraulic parameters on the wave run up for a constant period the water depth and wave height remain the main hydrodynamic parameters affecting the heave motion of the buoy therefore effects on the wave run up around the buoy were investigated and are presented in fig 17 the results in fig 17 a show that when the water depth increases from 0 8 m to 1 4 m the normalised maximum run up heights around the buoy varies within 0 1 the movement of the free water surface is not affected by the water depth when it is much deeper than the draft of the buoy as indicated in fig 17 b the wave run ups in the front and rear sides of the buoy obey different variation laws when the wave height increases from 0 12 m to 0 24 m the wave run up in front of the buoy first increases and then decreases with increase in wave height however the wave run up behind the buoy increases with wave height the reason for this trend is the increase of maximum vertical displacement of the buoy with increase in wave height which consumes most of the wave energy whereas the heave motion has a weaker effect on the energy transfer behind the buoy meanwhile the influence of wave height on the free surface height in front of the buoy is much smaller than the heaving displacement of the buoy which causes the wave run up in front of the buoy to first increase and then decrease 5 3 3 effect of structural parameters on the wave run up the radius and density of the buoy are two important structural parameters for determining the wave run up around the buoy the relationship between the maximum normalised run up height and radius is discussed in fig 18 a according to the figure the wave run up on both sides of the buoy α 90 is hardly affected by the buoy radius whereas the maximum normalised run up heights increase with the increase of the buoy radius in other angles for a constant wave condition when the buoy radius increases by 67 the normalised maximum run up heights in the wave ward and leeward sides of buoy increase by approximately 23 according to shi et al 2019 for the heave motion the capture width ratio increases with increasing radius at low wave frequencies ω 3 1 rad s this indicates that the wave energy acting on the buoy increases with the radius the relationship between maximum normalised run up heights and the density of buoy ρ is discussed in fig 18 b the results show that density had little effect on the wave run up around the buoy according to ao et al 2018 the heave motion response decreases with increasing buoy mass at low wave frequencies ω 3 1 rad s while the free surface height around the heaving buoy increases with increasing density this trend can be attributed to the fact that the difference in wave run ups around the buoy with density changes can be eliminated by the vector sum of displacement and wave surface height 5 4 maximum wave loads on buoy 5 4 1 effect of damping parameters on maximum wave load the normalised maximum horizontal and vertical wave loads impacting the buoy under different damping parameters are shown in fig 19 where f x and f z are the maximum horizontal and vertical wave loads respectively and g ρ g s h is the gravitational pull of the buoy we found that the normalised value of f x ρ g s h and f z ρ g s h increase with increase of the damping coefficient c for a constant wave case 1 h 0 12 m when damping coefficient increases from 0 to 1 000 n s m the normalised maximum horizontal and vertical loads increase by 26 7 and 13 4 respectively when the spring coefficient increases from 0 to 2 000 kg s2 the normalised maximum horizontal and vertical wave loads decrease by 9 9 and 1 6 respectively the results indicate that the influence of the damping coefficient on the wave loads is much greater than that of the spring coefficient and the spring coefficient has little effect on the horizontal wave loads impacting the buoy the reason for this trend is the increase in damping coefficient which leads to increase of resistance to heaving motion which in turn increases the intensity of coupling between the wave and the buoy by contrast the increase of the spring coefficient offers a higher restoring force for the heaving motion resulting in the maximum wave load on the buoy exhibiting a downward trend 5 4 2 effect of wave steepness parameter on maximum wave load fig 20 indicates the relationship between the wave steepness parameter k a and the normalised maximum wave loads on the buoy we observed that the normalised maximum horizontal and vertical wave loads increase by 128 and 6 7 respectively as the wave steepness increases from 0 072 to 0 144 the results indicate that the maximum wave loads impacting the buoy increase with the increase of wave steepness in this case the maximum horizontal wave load is mainly subjected to the variation of wave steepness for the heaving buoy which is the same as the fixed structures made by lin et al 2017 a plausible explanation of this phenomenon is that the wave energy is proportional to the square of the wave height and therefore the wave height is the main factor in determining the stability of the fixed milanian et al 2016 or floating structures correspondingly the wave steepness is also the main parameter required to increase the wave loads on the buoy especially the wave loads in the horizontal direction 5 4 3 effect of wave scattering parameter on maximum wave load fig 21 shows the variation of normalised maximum wave loads with wave scattering parameter k a it can be observed that when the wave scattering parameter increases from 0 164 to 0 410 the normalised maximum horizontal and vertical wave loads decrease by 14 7 and 1 1 respectively the gravitational force of the buoy increases with the increase of k a the range of wave force acting on the buoy with the increase of radius is much smaller than that of the gravitational force of the buoy which leads to the decrease of normalised maximum wave loads with the increase of k a the results once again indicate that the normalised maximum vertical wave load is less affected by heaving motion as long as the buoy does not leave the wave surface 6 conclusions in this study a three dimensional numerical wave model was established to simulate the wave run up heights and wave loads on a heaving buoy wave energy converter the model was tested and the consistency of the numerical results was verified the most important findings of the numerical analysis and physical model experiments are summarised as follows 1 the coupling motion of the wave and the buoy leads to better passing ability for the incident regular wave thus eliminating the wave field disorder around the buoy hence a single free heaving buoy has less effect on the surrounding wave fields than the fixed buoy for a constant wave condition k a 0 1 the wave run up in front of the heaving buoy is much less than that of the fixed foundation 2 for the heaving buoy the kinetic energy is mainly concentrated in wave ward and leeward sides of the buoy which causes the maximum pressure and flow velocity on the bottom of the buoy to appear in these two positions among them the maximum and minimum pressure increased by 47 and 8 5 over the initial pressure respectively 3 for the heaving buoy with pto the damping coefficient has greater influence on the maximum run up heights in front of the buoy by contrast the spring coefficient has a significant effect on the maximum run up heights behind the buoy generally the maximum wave loads increase with the increase of the damping coefficient whereas the spring coefficient has a weak influence on the maximum wave loads especially on the maximum horizontal wave loads 4 for the heaving buoy without pto the wave height and the buoy radius are the main parameters affecting the distribution of maximum normalised run up heights around the buoy the water depth and the buoy density have less influence the maximum wave loads on the heaving buoy increase with the increase of wave steepness when the wave steepness doubles the normalised maximum horizontal wave loads increase by 128 the maximum horizontal wave load decreases with the increase of the wave scattering

20966,a brash ice channel is a typical operation condition for ice going commercial vessels the finnish swedish ice class rules fsicr define the vessels ice class performance requirements particularly in a brash ice channel the vessel performance can be verified using model tests which are conducted according to the fsicr guidelines however the guidelines define mainly the channel thickness and width this research examined which other brash ice parameters influence the brash ice behavior around a ship hull the study focuses on the brash ice as a material based on literature review of earlier research the author focused on five central parameters porosity piece size and distribution angle of repose compressibility and angle of internal friction these parameters were examined in three different model brash ice types the results show that different brash ice types have different properties covering all the five investigated parameters this variation in brash ice properties presumably affect the behavior of brash ice mass around a moving ship hull and the vessel resistance in brash ice indicating a need for better model brash ice standardization to secure consistent channel model test results keywords brash ice model testing porosity piece size and distribution angle of repose compressibility angle of internal friction 1 introduction effective winter navigation in ice covered sea areas is commonly based on icebreaker assistance and a commercial fleet with appropriate ice classes fig 1 the ice class is a proof of certain level of ice going capability a specific ice class has multiple requirements including the level of hull strengthening and engine power with the availability of icebreaker assistance the typical ice condition for a commercial vessel is a brash ice channel the finnish swedish ice class rules fsicr are determined using brash ice channel as the defining ice condition the engine power requirement of a vessel for a certain ice class can be determined based on a formula given in the rules or through conducting model scale tests in brash ice conditions trafi 2017 a brash ice channel forms as vessels pass the same channel several times and the ice breaks into small pieces in the baltic sea fairway channels the size of ice pieces seldom exceeds 1 0 m in diameter fig 2 and fig 3 over time the ice pieces become rounder and stronger as a result of the spinning movement in the water brash ice in nature is a granular material and there is no significant cohesion between the ice pieces mellor 1980 ice as a natural material has very diverse characteristics the brash ice channel condition can appear in nature in more diverse forms than intact ice as winter navigation through ice is an essential maritime activity understanding the mechanics and ice properties related to ship operations in a brash ice channel are of high importance due to the importance a number of researchers have investigated and analyzed brash ice properties using various methods under laboratory conditions in nature and based on purely theoretical and numerical approaches the early investigations focused on gathering knowledge and understanding the prevailing condition in nature therefore full scale measurements were conducted e g tuovinen 1979 studied piece size distribution sandkvist 1981 investigated brash ice growth kannari 1982 considered basic brash ice properties to understand tanker performance in an ice channel and nortala hoikkanen 1997 focused on brash ice channel porosity after the basic understanding from the properties was acquired the focus shifted to more detailed investigations on more specific properties in full scale and studies were expanded to model scale testing and numerical approaches as an example of this type of developments shear properties have been considered important in vessel resistance in a brash ice channel therefore many researchers have been executing different types of punch tests and shear box tests in full scale see e g leppäranta and hakala 1992 and the development of methods has been continuous see e g bonath et al 2019 the laboratory testing has been applied e g in developing punch test for in situ full scale testing bruneau et al 1996 and to improve understanding on the ice rubble failure processes under conditions in which the behavior cannot be directly observed azarnejad and brown 2001 the numerical methods have been applied additionally to physical tests e g punch test has been investigated using calculation models such as fem heinonen 2003 and dem polojärvi and tuhkuri 2009 this type of research has brough more insight to the measurement methods and prevailing processes as an example for shear property understanding fransson and sandkvist 1985 showed a correlation between amount of fine grained ice and friction through shear box study urroz and ettema 1987 proved shear box impractical for shear testing of mushy ice and concluded that floating ice rubble layer deforms as a cohesionless material considering influence of freeze bonding and using mohr coulomb failure criterion polojärvi et al 2015 concluded based on shear box physical laboratory experiments and 2d discrete element method dem simulations that the peak shear loads are limited by the buckling of force chains and mohr coulomb type material models do not explain the condition satisfactorily liferov and bonnemaire 2005 proposed the scaling of material cohesion could be independent from the geometrical scaling whilst noting that gravity forces are more important in punch tests based on combined in situ and laboratory tests despite its significance for ice class granting process the existing literature has to date not systemically investigated the channel brash ice material characteristics full scale experiments contain all the variations in the nature and act as a reference for the validation of the model scale experiments and numerical results however full scale experiments are expensive to conduct involve uncontrollable and unknown variables and can be conducted only after building the prototype on contrary the numerical methods and model scale testing allow a good control of variables are less expensive and can be conducted in the design phase however in order to represent ice conditions and processes correctly and to interpret the results ice model tests and simulation require a considerable understanding of the phenomenon despite the developments in numerical modelling the methods are bound by the assumptions and no model has been validated in a level granting a right to determine the power requirement for an ice class as the channel model test result can be a criterium for granting an ice class for a vessel developing the ice model test methods and full scale correlation is a topic of high importance when model tests are used for granting an ice class the sufficient power level is verified by proving that the vessel is able to advance at specific speed in a given brash ice channel the existing rules require reporting only the brash ice channel width and thickness this yields potentially invalid results because the current procedure fails to address the other model brash ice properties that influence test outcomes matala and skogström 2017 furthermore considering the multiform condition of brash ice in nature the first challenge in channel model test development is to define a standardized test condition this article details experimental work investigating model brash ice properties scrutinizes links between the brash ice properties and the vessel resistance in brash ice providing fundamental basic understanding and the basis for further research in the experimental work we investigated three different however justifiable model brash ice materials with respect to five brash ice parameters in our research we specifically focused on the granular and cohesionless character of brash ice in nature to evaluate the granular properties of model brash ice we chose the model brash ice types so that each ice type represents a different level of how loose separate or easily transformable or solid the individual ice pieces are in the medium soil mechanics is the science of equilibrium and motion of soil bodies and was chosen as our starting point to study the material parameters of brash ice because it has long traditions in material parameter testing helenelund 1967 tsytovich 1983 wood 1990 mancuso et al 2012 the methods of the soil mechanics have been developed to be consistent and repeatable soil mechanics was first applied in ice research by keinonen and nyman 1978 to analyze brash ice properties to enable analytical calculation of a vessel resistance in a first year ice ridge keinonen 1979 in keinonen s research the theoretical results were compared with full scale and model scale experiments and the agreement was found to be generally good the theory they used was based on coulomb s law and the research combined this theory with brash ice measurements made in a model test laboratory keinonen s research was pioneering as it successfully exploited new methods in brash ice research based on the earlier research related to vessel resistance in brash ice keinonen 1979 wilhelmson 1996 riska et al 1997 we chose to focus on five brash ice parameters the number of parameters was limited to five due to the time limitations related to ice tendency to alter over time these five parameters were chosen based on their assumed importance in vessel channel resistance the following parameters were measured using the existing measurement procedures 1 porosity 2 piece size and distribution 3 angle of repose 4 compressibility and 5 angle of internal friction all the five measured parameters are well known in soil mechanics discipline and specifically the soil mechanics practices were utilized when developing the test procedures these five parameters were measured with three different model brash ice types in three experiments the article had three main research questions 1 how the studied parameter varied in different model brash ice materials 2 how the measured values related to parameter values in nature 3 how did each parameter vary when the brash ice is being handled the article is structured as follows chapter 2 description of a vessel in brash ice chapter 2 1 introduces the vessel resistance in brash ice chapter 2 2 focuses on the five brash ice parameters which are investigated in this paper it describes what are the typical parameter values that have been observed in the nature chapter 3 describes the applied experimental brash ice measurement procedures chapter 4 presents the measurement results together with the analysis about divergences between the ice types and a comparison to the representative values in nature the discussion about the nature values is based on chapter 2 2 and literature overview about previous researches this study systematically examined ice properties from different model brash ice types aiming to provide understanding on brash ice properties therefore this study made a major contribution for following research about how the measured brash ice qualities could reflect to brash ice behavior around a moving ship hull and eventually to the vessel resistance in brash ice 2 description of a vessel in brash ice 2 1 vessel in brash ice understanding the brash ice interaction with the vessel is necessary to perceive the problematics with model brash ice when a vessel enters a brash ice channel the brash ice fragments first hit the vessel bow the vessel bow shape displaces the ice pieces to the vessel sides and the brash ice piles up around the ship hull forming accumulation in front of the bow at the channel sides or even under the ship depending on the hull shape behind the vessel the accumulations of ice fragments break up and the ice pieces float freely filling the channel behind the vessel usually within one ship length fig 4 the vessel resistance in ice generally consist of open water resistance and ice resistance which is usually considered to consist of three components 1 the breaking component 2 the submerging component and 3 the component depending on the friction and velocity given the brash ice channel has reached a steady form no breaking occurs and the breaking component is not included in brash ice channel resistance the submerging component considers the forces resulting from submerging the ice pieces and this component is strongly dependent on the vessel hull shape the submerging component could be interpreted to include also the forces from the ice pile up around the vessel hull and therefore referred as a submerging and displacement component the friction component includes the resistance originated from the friction forces between ice blocks and the vessel bow and sides kujala and riska 2010 to predict the vessel resistance correctly it is necessary to understand the brash ice behavior around the ship hull the brash ice particle movements around the ship hull are dependent on the brash ice characteristics and specifically the ice particle interaction see the ice pile up around the ship hull pictured using two different approaches fig 5 is a capture from a coupled cfd dem approach simulation of the brash ice and vessel interaction koivurova 2020 and fig 6 is a picture from a vessel model test based on literature review the five studied parameters 1 porosity 2 piece size and distribution 3 angle of repose 4 compressibility and 5 angle of internal friction are assumed to contribute vessel resistance and ice behavior around the hull 1 the brash ice porosity has an impact to the frictional resistance different porosity value represents a different amount of void different amount of ice volume present leads to different buoyancy of the brash ice mass and different frictional forces whilst acknowledging that the porosity varies widely in natural brash ice in model testing the objective is on keeping the porosity value constant and standardized to ensure the test conditions repeatability 2 the piece size distribution affects directly the porosity and the density and gravity forces of the ice mass 3 the angle of repose the steepest slope the material can be heaped without collapsing has a linear effect on the ice pile up at the vessel side and the height of the friction area caused by the brash ice mass influencing the vessel frictional resistance 4 the compressibility affects the frictional load at the vessel side and the force required to push the brash ice aside while being difficult or impossible to measure in full scale the compressibility value indicates the brash ice accumulation under external loads and therefore the different compressibility values reflects a different brash ice pile up around a moving ship hull the change in the compression index value could result in different brash ice form after the advancing vessel has forced the brash ice mass to the sides and eventually influence the submerging and displacement component of the vessel total resistance 5 the evaluation of internal friction angle is used only to indicate the material granular properties the material being granular or non granular significantly influences the material dynamics around the ship hull and the submerging and displacement component of the vessel total resistance this choice is supported by the fact that the mohr coulomb law which is the basis of internal friction angle measurement is true for ultimate equilibrium state and not applicable to after shear stage hence it follows that at processing of shear box test results the shearing force at instant of move start shall be considered only interaction force during the brash ice motion around a moving ship hull is not covered by mohr coulomb law 2 2 brash ice properties in nature knowing the target conditions is a key element when developing a model to know the condition in nature a data search was undertaken with particular focus on the five parameters which were studied in the experimental part of this work each parameters effect on vessel resistance is discussed in this chapter based on the literature review the magnitude of each parameter value in nature is used as a representative value for evaluating the experimental measurements in model scale there is limited published data on brash ice characteristics in full scale there are no recent studies about channel brash ice angle of repose compressibility or internal friction angle in earlier brash ice research the brash ice characteristics are often based on the well known research of mellor 1980 kankaanpää 1997 kannari 1982 and malmberg 1983 more recently research has focused on the provision of brash ice porosity and piece size distribution values bonath et al 2019 karulina et al 2019 due to the similarity with brash ice conditions floating accumulation of ice fragments some studies related to the mechanics and ice properties of ridge keel are of interest for understanding the behavior or brash ice however it should be notified in the analysis that the ice pieces in ridge keels have a more angular shape and the size of ice fragments can be larger gong et al 2019 porosity the amount of void is a relatively well understood property of brash ice brash ice porosity has a significant effect on granular material mechanical properties the porosity affects the brash ice volume and therefore the buoyancy force the buoyancy affects the vessel frictional resistance which forms a significant part of the vessel total resistance in theory granular materials that consist of solid particles have a porosity of 40 mellor 1980 the values reported from full scale and model scale experiments are listed in table 1 the measured values indicate there is a considerable variation in porosity values in brash ice samples 7 60 however they are not inconsistent with the theoretical value therefore the theoretical value is chosen to be the representative value piece size and the piece size distribution of brash ice was considered as an interesting property as geometrical scaling is applied according to soil mechanics principles the soil piece size does not necessarily define the mechanical behavior of a material the piece shape might have a more significant effect on granular material behavior cabalar 2018 rodriguez 2013 but we did not study the piece shape effect in this study the piece size distribution affects pieces pile up and porosity a recent study by bonath et al 2019 investigated the brash ice full scale properties including the piece size distribution in the barents sea the channel was produced by repeating passages of two icebreakers and the brash ice thickness was measured to be between 0 5 m and 1 3 m which are close to the fsicr conditions and the channel conditions in the baltic sea in general they reported the brash ice piece size biggest dimension to have mean values between 19 cm standard deviation 26 cm and 27 cm stdev 26 cm depending on measurement this information of block size and block size distribution was utilized in our research as geometrical scaling is applied scale factor λ 17 5 the target mean piece size would be between 11 mm and 15 mm averaging in 13 mm the values reported by bonath et al are similar to karulina et al 2019 research which define the brash ice fragment size to be less than 30 cm and earlier full scale measurements reported by tuovinen 1979 angle of repose represents the steepest slope the material can be heaped without collapsing mehta and barker 1994 the angle is different above and below water the angle of repose below water affects the brash ice piling up at the vessel side the height of the friction surface and eventually the vessel frictional resistance the angle of repose being the steepest slope possible it is rarely measured in full scale instead there are several measurements from channel edge profiles and measurements from ridge keel and sail angles it can be assumed that these slope angles are smaller compared to the actual angle of repose limit angle however they provide information about nature brash ice pile up tendency table 2 summarizes the considered slope angle measurements the profile measurements from channel edges are utilized as it can be assumed the highest measured angles in channel edge brash ice piles are close to the angle of repose kannari 1982 reports channel profiles measured in the bay of bothnia to evaluate the angle of repose the steepest slopes were collected from each channel profile kankaanpää 1997 reports baltic sea pressure ridge sail angles based on previously mentioned channel profile measurements of kannari and ridge keel measurements of kankaanpää wilhelmson 1996 assumed the brash ice channel angle of repose below water to be 22 6 timco and burden 1997 collected information from 22 different sources according to timco and burden 1997 the above water angle of repose the sail angle was affected by the ridge location and the ridges were categorized in temperate and beaufort ridges our area of interest the baltic sea is included in temperate region here the chosen representative values for both above and below water are based on the extensive ridge research of timco and burden s we were unable to find any data for the less important above water angle measured from channel brash ice consequently the corresponding ridge value is used as representative value their below water value seems appropriate being similar to channels measurements of kannari 1982 compressibility describes the relationship between applied force and displacement and how water escapes from the brash ice when external load is applied tsytovich 1983 brash ice compressibility was proposed to relate to the mechanism by which the brash ice piles up around the moving ship hull compressibility was included in the list of measured parameters to enable a comparison of the model brash ice types in a literature review no research was found that studied compressibility in full scale internal friction angle as a part of evaluating the shear properties is a well established parameter within soil mechanics brash ice internal friction angle also affects the brash ice piling up around the ship hull and the submerging and displacement component of vessel brash ice channel resistance the relationship between the material shear strength and internal friction angle is commonly described using mohr coulomb law eq 1 eq 1 τ f c σ tan φ where c represents cohesion σ the applied normal load and φ the internal friction angle helenelund 1967 according to helenelund the soil shear strength consists of two separate parts the internal friction fragments friction with adjacent fragments and cohesion molecular interaction in nature intermediate soil types are also possible which shear strength consists of both parts but the cohesion part is predominant in fine grained saturated soils φ 0 whereas the shear strength of coarse grained materials consists practically completely of internal friction c 0 helenelund 1967 the principle of φ 0 concept is generally used in engineering practice to determination of the saturated clays shear strength green and marcuson 2014 as this difference between granular and fine grained materials has a principal impact on the physics behind the studied process the internal friction angle was applied to evaluate the material type and categorize different model ice materials in granular and fine grained materials this is specifically relevant as we are working with model ice which easily becomes a non granular material if traditional froude scaling is applied and the original ice piece strength is very low according to recent studies cabalar 2018 sezer et al 2011 the shear properties and the stress strain responses of the materials are influenced not only by the piece size distribution but also fragment shape assuming channel brash ice consists of round particles we can refer only to observations made from similar channels according to coulombs law a theoretical internal friction angle for completely granular brash ice would vary between 42 and 58 malmberg 1983 in soil mechanics shear strength is generally measured using a device called shear box in a shear box experiment a brash ice sample is placed in a box which consists of two separate halves one of the halves can be moved and the required shear load is recorded this kind of experiment is difficult to conduct in full scale since certain boundary conditions set requirements for the device size however to date several studies have exploited shear box measurements in the laboratory fransson and sandkvist 1985 urroz and ettema 1987 bruneau et al 1996 based on these previous studies the representative values were determined for the five parameters which were investigated in this study with the exception of compressibility due to lack of information these values are presented in table 3 3 methods 3 1 the tested brash ice types three different brash ice types were analyzed using the presented measurement procedures the main variation between the brash ice types was the parental ice flexural strength the model brash ice types were deliberately chosen so that they represent significantly different level of granularity to enable detecting the differences in the measured parameters the two first brash ice types with softer ice pieces were produced from fgx model ice which is used at aker arctic test basin the ice is fine grained and the water is doped with salt the target thickness is controlled by the water spraying duration after which the ice field is hardened in cold temperature until the desired strength properties are achieved after this the cold room temperature is warmed up to 4 c in which the level ice properties alteration is minimal the brash ice was produced by manually cutting a level ice sheet into small pieces fig 7 the target properties of the model ice sheets for investigation ice types 1 and 2 were chosen based on flexural strength in general in the level ice vessel model tests the ice flexural strength is a central parameter because the ice fails in bending the present type of fxg model ice cannot model all the ice parameters simultaneously consequently only either flexural strength or compressive strength can be modeled correctly during testing the ratio between model ice compressive strength and model ice flexural strength is significantly lower than it is in natural sea ice the ratio in model ice is close to 1 matala 2012 but compressive strength was not measured from parental model ice fields despite flexural strength not being a substantial parameter in broken ice we chose to use flexural strength as a target value because it relates to ice piece compressive strength the target flexural strength refers to the initial level ice sheet flexural strength the strength was not measured later from the ice pieces because the flexural strength is measured using cantilever beam method which cannot be applied in broken ice condition the target flexural strengths of model ice sheets were chosen to be 29 kpa and 57 kpa based on the tradition of using froude scaling method in vessel model testing the level ice sheet thickness was chosen so that the target brash ice thickness was reached when the level ice was broken into brash ice the third brash ice type did not consist of model ice but artificial fresh water ice fragments no strength properties were measured from ice fragments but the ice was assumed to correspond to fresh water ice characteristics with a flexural strength approximately 600 kpa and an unconfined horizontal compressive strength 3000 kpa cammaert and muggeridge 1988 the ice fragments had a tube like hollow shape shown in fig 8 these three brash ice types are referred later as type 1 2 and 3 respectively table 4 the brash ice target thickness was 68 mm all the brash ice measurements were conducted in channel brash ice before a vessel channel test the vessel channel test was conducted three times in each brash ice type the brash ice measurements were undertaken once before each vessel channel test this way the effect of brash ice getting submerged and the changes in texture due to ice handling could be evaluated on one of the test days the measurements of angle of repose compressibility and internal friction angle could only be conducted twice instead of three times due to technical problems 3 2 the brash ice measurement equipment and procedures in the experimental part of this study we measured five parameters 1 brash ice porosity 2 piece size distribution 3 angle of repose 4 compressibility and 5 internal friction angle the measurement procedures were presented in detail in international conference on port and ocean engineering under arctic conditions poac 2019 matala skogström it is desirable to conduct all the tests in as a short time window as possible to minimize the ice property changes which occur as a result of ice storing time this limits the number of different measurements that can be undertaken as well as the possibility of repeating single tests porosity 1 was measured according to international towing tank conference recommendations ittc 2014 in the measurement a known volume of brash ice is submerged using an instrumented box fig 9 the ice mass buoyancy is measured with a force transducer measuring the vertical force f required to hold the sample submerged prior to the measurement the force transducer is balanced to zero to eliminate the box mass from the equation the empty box buoyancy was determined by conducting a similar test in open water n ow the porosity can be calculated according to archimedes principle using equation 2 eq 2 p v v o i d v t o t a l 1 v i c e v t o t a l 1 f n o w ρ w ρ i c e g a h 1 f n o w ρ w ρ i c e g a h where p is the porosity of brash ice v void is the volume of void v total is the total volume of the sample v ice is the total volume of the ice f is the measured vertical force required to hold the box submerged n ow is the buoyancy of the empty box ρ w the density of water ρ ice the density of ice g the gravitational acceleration a the area of the box bottom and h the brash ice thickness this measurement procedure is commonly used and it is perceived as an accurate and repeatable method the porosity was measured from three different longitudinal coordinates close to channel start close to channel end and in the middle from each brash ice channel and the standard deviation of the measurements was defined based on these measurements the ice density was measured separately using ittc 2014 procedure in which an ice piece is submerged in a water container placed on a balance and the density is calculated based on the submerging weight equation 3 eq 3 ρ i c e ρ w w 2 w 1 w 3 w 1 where w 1 is the weight of the water container without ice sample w 2 is the weight with the ice sample floating freely in the water and w 3 is the weight with the ice sample submerged entirely in the water the piece size distribution 2 was evaluated using cameras and applying mathematical processing to the pictures the piece size distribution was defined by pouring a known volume of brash ice loosely on a gridded plate and taking a picture the grid functioned as a scale the picture was processed using matlab the program separated the white ice pieces defined the area of each ice piece by fitting a circle with the same area at the top of each ice piece and counted the amount of different sized ice pieces the size represents the diameter of the circle having similar area with the ice fragment the piece size distributions of different brash ice types were compared by determining the center of gravity from each distribution chart and comparing the mean piece size and standard deviation of the observed piece sizes the measurement was fast and easy to conduct the major drawback of this approach is that only white ice pieces were visible in the analysis and the procedure ignores the transparent slush like particles that is present specifically in soft model ice the angle of repose 3 was also measured using cameras both above and below water below water the angle was defined by filling a transparent box 300 mm 780 mm 280 mm with brash ice and pressing the ice mass towards one end and releasing the pressure gently so that the slope formed freely we assume that no limit thickness is achieved in a vessel channel test and therefore also the test evaluates the angle of resume as a material specific constant below the limit thickness the slope was photographed using underwater camera and the angle was determined from the picture afterwards fig 10 above water the angle of repose was determined by piling gently brash ice on an even plate letting the slope form freely and then taking a picture in a similar manner to below water procedure fig 11 compressibility 4 was measured using a special measuring box in the beginning of the measurement the box was set below water level and filled with brash ice the box was built from plexiglass one end plate functioned as a piston which moved forward when load was applied to the system see principle in fig 12 and the device in use in fig 13 the other end plate was perforated to allow water escape from the box the box lid was attached with hinges which enabled filling the box with brash ice the box cross sectional dimensions were 300 mm 280 mm and the original length before compression was 780 mm the load was applied to the system by hanging different weights into the cable system which transferred the load to the piston multiple loads were applied and the corresponding piston displacements were measured the data pairs were plotted in a chart there was some internal friction in the device and the piston started moving only after some original weights were applied to the system and at the end of the measurement the piston stopped moving because the brash ice reached the entirely compressed state therefore both the beginning and the end points were not used in the analysis and only values obtained when the piston was moving linearly were analyzed compressibility is evaluated using volume change equation in which the compression index λ c describes the volume change relation to logarithmic unit change of stress λ c d v d log σ mancuso et al 2012 see an example of analysis in fig 14 the angle of internal friction 5 is measured in soil mechanics by using a shear box the shear box concept was also applied in the measurement device which was developed for measuring brash ice angle of internal friction the measurement device is a transparent box which consists of two separate halves the lower box was fixed and the upper part could be moved using a force transducer the box lid is able to move in upright direction to enable applying different normal loads the device principle picture is presented in fig 15 in the measurement the box was set below water level and filled with brash ice the upper halve was moved and the required force was recorded the test was conducted several times with different normal loads so that the relation between normal load and shear stress could be detected fig 16 the purpose of this measure was to qualitatively evaluate the granularity of the material and therefore only the slope of this curve the internal friction angle is considered the analysis was done using shear box analysis procedures dang et al 2017 when the measurement starts the shear force increases with the horizontal displacement of the upper halve of the box until reaching a constant level however the device was found not to be sufficiently stiff to allow measuring the peak loads reliably and therefore the analysis was done based on the average level shear force reached an example of a measurement time history is presented in fig 17 4 results of brash ice measurements this chapter presents the results and findings of the study focusing on the three key questions 1 how does the studied parameter vary in different model brash ice materials 2 what is the measured values relation to parameter values in nature 3 how does the brash ice getting submerged as a result of material handling influence each parameter value each parameter s representative value in nature and their origins were introduced in the chapter 2 2 and summarized in table 3 considering the great number of different tests and the limited time window each test could be conducted only once in each brash ice channel with the exception of porosity which was tested three times in each channel 4 1 the results of porosity measurements the porosity measurement results are presented in table 5 and fig 18 the results indicate that the different brash ice types do have different porosity as stated in chapter 2 2 the porosity is affected by the granular material piece size distribution and the parameters cannot be viewed completely independently the piece size distribution is different for the ice types due to the brash ice cutting process the observed varying porosity is an important finding this is because even small variation in porosity have a significant effect in buoyancy force and eventually vessel frictional resistance in view of the small total number of measurements this might have limited the ability to identify trends between the different ice types ice type 3 fragments were tube like chapter 3 1 consequently the brash ice type 3 porosity values are not comparable to model ice values with regards ice type 3 the presence of the void inside the ice fragments is the cause of higher porosity values than what would be expected if the ice pieces were solid thus certain part of the ice type 3 void being inside the ice fragments instead of being between the fragments the effect to ice piece interaction might have been smaller than the numerical porosity value indicates the porosity values we measured varied between 30 0 and 55 1 and the porosity values of ice types 1 and 2 between 30 0 and 43 7 the representative value was set to a theoretical 40 given the variation of brash ice porosity in nature none of the tested ice types diverged significantly from the observed condition in nature the fsicr do not specify if the channel can be reconstructed for repeat model testing in the setting of repeat channel testing brash ice porosity was affected for brash ice types 1 and 2 soft model ice the repeat channel testing affects the amount of ice in the channel altering the vessel resistance in the brash ice channel this could be a consequence of increased amount of small slush like ice fragments which use space between solid ice fragments but which density is close to water density and therefore they have only marginally buoyancy the repeat testing had no effect on brash ice type 3 porosity 4 2 the results of piece size and piece size distribution measurements the piece size distribution histograms are presented in fig 19 each measurement of mean piece size and standard deviation are collected in table 6 and presented in fig 20 ice types 1 and 2 which represent model ice were cut into pieces manually which resulted in a significant variation in piece size the model brash ice piece size was larger than ice type 3 fragments especially the stronger model brash ice the ice type 2 produced significantly larger ice pieces than the other two brash ice types the model ice s cutting process that was used resulted in a significant variation in piece size during the manual cutting process it was found to be difficult to break the ice into fragments which were smaller than the ice sheet thickness which in our test series was 40 mm ice type 3 had smallest piece size and this ice type corresponds best to scaling for real world sea brash ice however during our study we also considered that modeling based on simple geometric scaling might not be the ideal method this is because the soft model ice easily becomes a non granular material when processed and cut into very small fragments consequently we prioritized the minimal processing over the small piece size as expected the repeating of the channel test did not affect the ice type 3 s piece size on repeat testing the greatest effect was seen on the piece size of ice type 2 the strong model ice why there is less changing in piece size with ice type 1 on repeat testing the softer model ice could possibly be explained by the fact that the soft model ice is originally very soft and therefore the ice pieces break into slush during the first testing process the ice pieces remaining in water during the repeat tests the strength of ice fragments is affected and it could be that ice type 2 properties approach softer ice type 1 over time this could also explain the smaller differential between repeated tests with soft model ice compared to stronger model ice 4 3 the results of angle of repose measurements the angle of repose measurement results are presented in table 7 the above water results are presented in fig 21 and below water results in fig 22 there is a significant difference in the angle of repose values with the different ice types it is important to reiterate that the representative value here refers to brash ice typical slope angle instead of the steepest limit angle the representative value being lower the ice type 3 proposed value 19 below water is within the representative value standard deviation our results show that the ice type with higher ice piece initial flexural strength is related to a lower angle of repose both above and below water why the softer ice types maintains a higher angle of reposes maybe explained by the cohesion between the ice pieces the soft ice pieces deform pile up and fasten upon the adjacent ice pieces in contrast the solid fresh water ice fragments stay unattached and show no interaction with the adjacent fragments the repeat channel testing resulted in an increase in the angle of reposes for both ice types 1 and 2 this might be due to the soft ice pieces tendency to adhere together the model brash ice pieces become wetter and softer during the repeat channel test which results in changes towards a softer slush like material when the tests with soft ice types 1 and 2 are repeated the below water repose angles approach 90 angles within the tested brash ice height a photograph of such 90 degree angle of repose is presented in fig 23 the ice type 3 angles of repose remained minimally changed in repeat tests 4 4 the results of compressibility measurements the compression index test results are presented in table 8 and fig 24 this test was undertaken to evaluate the water escape from the material under external load the analysis reveals the different order of magnitude in the compressibility index between ice types 1 and 2 model ice compared to ice type 3 strong ice fragments the water escapes easier from the brash ice type 3 how the water escapes from the brash ice affects the brash ice movement and pile up in the vessel sides and therefore a remarkable difference in the compressibility index should affect the vessel channel resistance the compression index testing device would require further development before the test results could be applied for quantitative purpose of other researchers the steps between the applied weights were not sufficient and more measurement points would have been needed to make more reliable analysis with smaller spread the test device limitations which were mentioned above do not allow the evaluation of the effect of repeat testing on compressibility 4 5 the results of internal friction angle measurements the shear box measurements results are analyzed comparing the internal friction angle values to evaluate the material granularity to be granular the internal friction angle should be theoretically about 42 58 the results are presented in table 9 and in fig 25 the measured internal friction angles from different ice types had a wide distribution of values when only considering the initial test results there was a significant variation in results the values varying between 21 9 and 35 9 the variation in results further increased with repeat channel testing technical issues with the testing device limited the numerical comparison of the results and therefore the measured negative internal friction angles should be interpreted with caution this is further discussed in the chapter 5 1 the value of this measurement is detecting the effect of test repeat which had a crucial effect on the model brash ice ice types 1 and 2 internal friction angle we conclude that neither soft nor strong model ice can be considered as a granular material after the first test run the ice type 3 the brash ice made of strong ice fragments remained granular in all three tests 5 discussion 5 1 the measuring equipment functionality overall all devices functioned well allowing evaluation of the different brash ice types on all the measured parameters the measurement results of porosity piece size and piece size distribution and angle of repose were of good quality and the results can be utilized in the later analysis of vessel channel tests the measurements were fast to conduct and the measured values were credible the compressibility and shear box measurement results allowed qualitative comparison of the ice types and they were able to reveal the different responses of the different brash ice types to provide more reliable numerical data for use of other researchers the measurement devices for compressibility and shear strength measurements would require further development there were limitations with the compressibility measurement device the mechanical weight based loading system should be replaced we would propose with a force transducer to enable a continuous measurement instead of datapoints that were collected using physical weights using a force transducer could also allow the evaluation of the brash ice reversion characteristics when the external load is released the shear box stiffness did not allow reliable measurement of peak values however the test was able to reveal the model ice tendency to become a non granular material during brash ice handling due to test repeat as the internal friction angle dropped close to zero after the first channel test this detail of the change of ice from a granular to a non granular material is relevant for later studies on model channel testing the numerical results were of insufficient quality to provide more understanding for the research polojärvi et al 2015 indicated in their shear box study that shear loads are results of force chains and therefore no definite shear strength value can be measured with shear box from brash ice as a consequence we have decided not to develop the shear strength measurement device further as part of our future brash ice channel test research as it has proven not to provide additional information in this investigation we acknowledge there are several potential sources of error the limited amount of testing and test results may be the main source of error given the great number of different parameter tests it was not possible to repeat individual tests on this occasion another potential source of error is the fact that ice as a material has a wide scatter in properties consequently this may represent error or alternatively reflect the natural spread in nature however as the measurements were systemically undertaken to a specified methodology all of the measurements and results provide information about the differences between the brash ice types 5 2 main differences between tested brash ice types the difference in the tested ice types 1 2 and 3 target properties was the ice pieces original flexural strength the artificial fresh water ice ice type 3 had a distinctly different geometrical form from the model ice types ice types 1 and 2 the ice piece strength properties are affected by repeating the channel test the changes to the ice fragment strength properties are caused by both the additional ice handling to rearrange the ice channel for the following test and the model channel test itself which makes the ice pieces wetter softer and reshapes the ice pieces the observed interaction between the ice particles was different in the three ice types ice particle interaction is affected by surface frictional properties the transformation of ice pieces during the interaction and by the presence of small slush like particles these factors had a major effect on repeat testing of ice types 1 and 2 characteristics but there was no influence on ice type 3 the reason for no change in ice type 3 results on repeat testing was the fact that the solid ice pieces of ice type 3 did not change because of the ice handling and therefore the brash ice characteristics also remained similar to the first test run despite the repeat testing in addition to ice type 3 ice fragment being initially very strong the ice type 3 does not contain any additional dope like salt or alcohol which might also influence the transformation tendency 5 3 observations from measured brash ice parameters measured from different brash ice types the nature of ice is that it has characteristics which can vary widely which can make analysis complicated and difficult the following summarizes the observations made from our recent study 1 different porosity values were found with each of the three different brash ice types 2 the amount of void increased when the model test was repeated in originally very soft model ice ice type 1 3 whilst our piece size distribution measurement was not able to measure the smallest transparent fragment that exist in the brash ice in nature and in the brash ice types 1 and 2 this slush like medium undoubtedly affects the brash ice behavior and eventually the vessel resistance in brash ice the presence of small particle significantly changes ice particle interaction compared to the situation in which practically no small particles exist in the medium in the ice type 3 conceivably this slush like material is similar in full scale and model scale and the other properties being scaled the slush effect in model scale is prominent 4 the angle of repose varied significantly between all three ice types when the ice types 1 and 2 became soft and slush like there was more cohesion between the pieces to maintain higher angles of reposes 5 the compressibility test revealed that the water escape requires significantly greater load for ice type 1 and 2 compared to ice type 3 6 the model brash ice altered in structure from a granular to a non granular material for ice types 1 and 2 on repeat testing ice type 3 which had a significantly higher initial ice piece solidity compared to model ice types remained granular in repeat testing 7 the initial solidity of model ice types 1 and 2 became negligible when the ice was handled several times and the model ice types became similar non granular materials when repeating the tests the observations are summarized in table form to assist in evaluating the ice types as a whole table 10 summarizes the observations by arranging the tested ice types based on their relation to the representative values in nature table 11 shows the test repeat effect on each parameter related to the tested ice types these findings help us to understand ice fragment interaction in brash ice the measured numerical values of compressibility and internal friction angle must be interpreted with caution due to limited accuracy of the measurements the presented results are significant in at least two major respects first this study has identified the significance of ice piece interaction in model brash ice second this study has proven there is a need for better standardization of model tests involving brash ice 6 conclusion this study focuses solely on brash ice properties the ultimate goal of this research is to improve current understanding of brash ice behavior around a moving ship hull and to enable the further development of effective and standardized model testing procedures five brash ice parameters were investigated in model test experiments in three different model brash ice types and the results were analyzed related to three factors 1 the model brash ice type 2 the parameter value in nature and 3 the order number of test repeat all three model ice types were justified based on the current model test practices to enable detecting differences in the model brash ice the brash ice types were intentionally chosen to represent very different level of ice piece separation each model brash ice type represents different level of how loose separate easily transformable or solid the ice fragments are in water the evidence derived from this study suggest that different ice types have different properties covering all the five parameters investigated in this study this indicates there is a need for better model brash ice standardization to secure consistent channel model test results the results also indicate that model ice ice types 1 and 2 properties undergo significant changes when the tests are repeated a proposed explanation for the differences between the ice types is that less solid model ice types 1 and 2 are exposed for increased ice piece interaction which contributes to ice block metamorphosis increased friction and even merging of separate ice blocks this ice piece interaction is significantly less or non existent when the ice pieces are originally more solid mellor 1980 points out that very fine grained cohesive material is present in brash ice in nature the slush like material mellor describes appears to be similar to the slush like material we observed when we conducted our model testing with soft model ice ice types 1 and 2 the influence of this slush is prominent on model tests because other properties are being appropriately scaled we also observed that soft model ice could lose the intended granular nature and become a non granular material during the channel testing which certainly influences the channel test outcomes our brash ice property observations show that the studied different model brash ice types have different ice fragment interaction and therefore they are expected to behave in a different manner around a moving ship hull furthermore our findings encourage the evaluation of the use of froude scaling in model tests conducted in broken ice which is currently a common practice this is because the scaled down strength properties make the brash ice pieces less solid and as a consequence alter the test conditions further consideration regarding the role of fragment shape effect on brash ice properties would be worthwhile declaration of competing

20966,a brash ice channel is a typical operation condition for ice going commercial vessels the finnish swedish ice class rules fsicr define the vessels ice class performance requirements particularly in a brash ice channel the vessel performance can be verified using model tests which are conducted according to the fsicr guidelines however the guidelines define mainly the channel thickness and width this research examined which other brash ice parameters influence the brash ice behavior around a ship hull the study focuses on the brash ice as a material based on literature review of earlier research the author focused on five central parameters porosity piece size and distribution angle of repose compressibility and angle of internal friction these parameters were examined in three different model brash ice types the results show that different brash ice types have different properties covering all the five investigated parameters this variation in brash ice properties presumably affect the behavior of brash ice mass around a moving ship hull and the vessel resistance in brash ice indicating a need for better model brash ice standardization to secure consistent channel model test results keywords brash ice model testing porosity piece size and distribution angle of repose compressibility angle of internal friction 1 introduction effective winter navigation in ice covered sea areas is commonly based on icebreaker assistance and a commercial fleet with appropriate ice classes fig 1 the ice class is a proof of certain level of ice going capability a specific ice class has multiple requirements including the level of hull strengthening and engine power with the availability of icebreaker assistance the typical ice condition for a commercial vessel is a brash ice channel the finnish swedish ice class rules fsicr are determined using brash ice channel as the defining ice condition the engine power requirement of a vessel for a certain ice class can be determined based on a formula given in the rules or through conducting model scale tests in brash ice conditions trafi 2017 a brash ice channel forms as vessels pass the same channel several times and the ice breaks into small pieces in the baltic sea fairway channels the size of ice pieces seldom exceeds 1 0 m in diameter fig 2 and fig 3 over time the ice pieces become rounder and stronger as a result of the spinning movement in the water brash ice in nature is a granular material and there is no significant cohesion between the ice pieces mellor 1980 ice as a natural material has very diverse characteristics the brash ice channel condition can appear in nature in more diverse forms than intact ice as winter navigation through ice is an essential maritime activity understanding the mechanics and ice properties related to ship operations in a brash ice channel are of high importance due to the importance a number of researchers have investigated and analyzed brash ice properties using various methods under laboratory conditions in nature and based on purely theoretical and numerical approaches the early investigations focused on gathering knowledge and understanding the prevailing condition in nature therefore full scale measurements were conducted e g tuovinen 1979 studied piece size distribution sandkvist 1981 investigated brash ice growth kannari 1982 considered basic brash ice properties to understand tanker performance in an ice channel and nortala hoikkanen 1997 focused on brash ice channel porosity after the basic understanding from the properties was acquired the focus shifted to more detailed investigations on more specific properties in full scale and studies were expanded to model scale testing and numerical approaches as an example of this type of developments shear properties have been considered important in vessel resistance in a brash ice channel therefore many researchers have been executing different types of punch tests and shear box tests in full scale see e g leppäranta and hakala 1992 and the development of methods has been continuous see e g bonath et al 2019 the laboratory testing has been applied e g in developing punch test for in situ full scale testing bruneau et al 1996 and to improve understanding on the ice rubble failure processes under conditions in which the behavior cannot be directly observed azarnejad and brown 2001 the numerical methods have been applied additionally to physical tests e g punch test has been investigated using calculation models such as fem heinonen 2003 and dem polojärvi and tuhkuri 2009 this type of research has brough more insight to the measurement methods and prevailing processes as an example for shear property understanding fransson and sandkvist 1985 showed a correlation between amount of fine grained ice and friction through shear box study urroz and ettema 1987 proved shear box impractical for shear testing of mushy ice and concluded that floating ice rubble layer deforms as a cohesionless material considering influence of freeze bonding and using mohr coulomb failure criterion polojärvi et al 2015 concluded based on shear box physical laboratory experiments and 2d discrete element method dem simulations that the peak shear loads are limited by the buckling of force chains and mohr coulomb type material models do not explain the condition satisfactorily liferov and bonnemaire 2005 proposed the scaling of material cohesion could be independent from the geometrical scaling whilst noting that gravity forces are more important in punch tests based on combined in situ and laboratory tests despite its significance for ice class granting process the existing literature has to date not systemically investigated the channel brash ice material characteristics full scale experiments contain all the variations in the nature and act as a reference for the validation of the model scale experiments and numerical results however full scale experiments are expensive to conduct involve uncontrollable and unknown variables and can be conducted only after building the prototype on contrary the numerical methods and model scale testing allow a good control of variables are less expensive and can be conducted in the design phase however in order to represent ice conditions and processes correctly and to interpret the results ice model tests and simulation require a considerable understanding of the phenomenon despite the developments in numerical modelling the methods are bound by the assumptions and no model has been validated in a level granting a right to determine the power requirement for an ice class as the channel model test result can be a criterium for granting an ice class for a vessel developing the ice model test methods and full scale correlation is a topic of high importance when model tests are used for granting an ice class the sufficient power level is verified by proving that the vessel is able to advance at specific speed in a given brash ice channel the existing rules require reporting only the brash ice channel width and thickness this yields potentially invalid results because the current procedure fails to address the other model brash ice properties that influence test outcomes matala and skogström 2017 furthermore considering the multiform condition of brash ice in nature the first challenge in channel model test development is to define a standardized test condition this article details experimental work investigating model brash ice properties scrutinizes links between the brash ice properties and the vessel resistance in brash ice providing fundamental basic understanding and the basis for further research in the experimental work we investigated three different however justifiable model brash ice materials with respect to five brash ice parameters in our research we specifically focused on the granular and cohesionless character of brash ice in nature to evaluate the granular properties of model brash ice we chose the model brash ice types so that each ice type represents a different level of how loose separate or easily transformable or solid the individual ice pieces are in the medium soil mechanics is the science of equilibrium and motion of soil bodies and was chosen as our starting point to study the material parameters of brash ice because it has long traditions in material parameter testing helenelund 1967 tsytovich 1983 wood 1990 mancuso et al 2012 the methods of the soil mechanics have been developed to be consistent and repeatable soil mechanics was first applied in ice research by keinonen and nyman 1978 to analyze brash ice properties to enable analytical calculation of a vessel resistance in a first year ice ridge keinonen 1979 in keinonen s research the theoretical results were compared with full scale and model scale experiments and the agreement was found to be generally good the theory they used was based on coulomb s law and the research combined this theory with brash ice measurements made in a model test laboratory keinonen s research was pioneering as it successfully exploited new methods in brash ice research based on the earlier research related to vessel resistance in brash ice keinonen 1979 wilhelmson 1996 riska et al 1997 we chose to focus on five brash ice parameters the number of parameters was limited to five due to the time limitations related to ice tendency to alter over time these five parameters were chosen based on their assumed importance in vessel channel resistance the following parameters were measured using the existing measurement procedures 1 porosity 2 piece size and distribution 3 angle of repose 4 compressibility and 5 angle of internal friction all the five measured parameters are well known in soil mechanics discipline and specifically the soil mechanics practices were utilized when developing the test procedures these five parameters were measured with three different model brash ice types in three experiments the article had three main research questions 1 how the studied parameter varied in different model brash ice materials 2 how the measured values related to parameter values in nature 3 how did each parameter vary when the brash ice is being handled the article is structured as follows chapter 2 description of a vessel in brash ice chapter 2 1 introduces the vessel resistance in brash ice chapter 2 2 focuses on the five brash ice parameters which are investigated in this paper it describes what are the typical parameter values that have been observed in the nature chapter 3 describes the applied experimental brash ice measurement procedures chapter 4 presents the measurement results together with the analysis about divergences between the ice types and a comparison to the representative values in nature the discussion about the nature values is based on chapter 2 2 and literature overview about previous researches this study systematically examined ice properties from different model brash ice types aiming to provide understanding on brash ice properties therefore this study made a major contribution for following research about how the measured brash ice qualities could reflect to brash ice behavior around a moving ship hull and eventually to the vessel resistance in brash ice 2 description of a vessel in brash ice 2 1 vessel in brash ice understanding the brash ice interaction with the vessel is necessary to perceive the problematics with model brash ice when a vessel enters a brash ice channel the brash ice fragments first hit the vessel bow the vessel bow shape displaces the ice pieces to the vessel sides and the brash ice piles up around the ship hull forming accumulation in front of the bow at the channel sides or even under the ship depending on the hull shape behind the vessel the accumulations of ice fragments break up and the ice pieces float freely filling the channel behind the vessel usually within one ship length fig 4 the vessel resistance in ice generally consist of open water resistance and ice resistance which is usually considered to consist of three components 1 the breaking component 2 the submerging component and 3 the component depending on the friction and velocity given the brash ice channel has reached a steady form no breaking occurs and the breaking component is not included in brash ice channel resistance the submerging component considers the forces resulting from submerging the ice pieces and this component is strongly dependent on the vessel hull shape the submerging component could be interpreted to include also the forces from the ice pile up around the vessel hull and therefore referred as a submerging and displacement component the friction component includes the resistance originated from the friction forces between ice blocks and the vessel bow and sides kujala and riska 2010 to predict the vessel resistance correctly it is necessary to understand the brash ice behavior around the ship hull the brash ice particle movements around the ship hull are dependent on the brash ice characteristics and specifically the ice particle interaction see the ice pile up around the ship hull pictured using two different approaches fig 5 is a capture from a coupled cfd dem approach simulation of the brash ice and vessel interaction koivurova 2020 and fig 6 is a picture from a vessel model test based on literature review the five studied parameters 1 porosity 2 piece size and distribution 3 angle of repose 4 compressibility and 5 angle of internal friction are assumed to contribute vessel resistance and ice behavior around the hull 1 the brash ice porosity has an impact to the frictional resistance different porosity value represents a different amount of void different amount of ice volume present leads to different buoyancy of the brash ice mass and different frictional forces whilst acknowledging that the porosity varies widely in natural brash ice in model testing the objective is on keeping the porosity value constant and standardized to ensure the test conditions repeatability 2 the piece size distribution affects directly the porosity and the density and gravity forces of the ice mass 3 the angle of repose the steepest slope the material can be heaped without collapsing has a linear effect on the ice pile up at the vessel side and the height of the friction area caused by the brash ice mass influencing the vessel frictional resistance 4 the compressibility affects the frictional load at the vessel side and the force required to push the brash ice aside while being difficult or impossible to measure in full scale the compressibility value indicates the brash ice accumulation under external loads and therefore the different compressibility values reflects a different brash ice pile up around a moving ship hull the change in the compression index value could result in different brash ice form after the advancing vessel has forced the brash ice mass to the sides and eventually influence the submerging and displacement component of the vessel total resistance 5 the evaluation of internal friction angle is used only to indicate the material granular properties the material being granular or non granular significantly influences the material dynamics around the ship hull and the submerging and displacement component of the vessel total resistance this choice is supported by the fact that the mohr coulomb law which is the basis of internal friction angle measurement is true for ultimate equilibrium state and not applicable to after shear stage hence it follows that at processing of shear box test results the shearing force at instant of move start shall be considered only interaction force during the brash ice motion around a moving ship hull is not covered by mohr coulomb law 2 2 brash ice properties in nature knowing the target conditions is a key element when developing a model to know the condition in nature a data search was undertaken with particular focus on the five parameters which were studied in the experimental part of this work each parameters effect on vessel resistance is discussed in this chapter based on the literature review the magnitude of each parameter value in nature is used as a representative value for evaluating the experimental measurements in model scale there is limited published data on brash ice characteristics in full scale there are no recent studies about channel brash ice angle of repose compressibility or internal friction angle in earlier brash ice research the brash ice characteristics are often based on the well known research of mellor 1980 kankaanpää 1997 kannari 1982 and malmberg 1983 more recently research has focused on the provision of brash ice porosity and piece size distribution values bonath et al 2019 karulina et al 2019 due to the similarity with brash ice conditions floating accumulation of ice fragments some studies related to the mechanics and ice properties of ridge keel are of interest for understanding the behavior or brash ice however it should be notified in the analysis that the ice pieces in ridge keels have a more angular shape and the size of ice fragments can be larger gong et al 2019 porosity the amount of void is a relatively well understood property of brash ice brash ice porosity has a significant effect on granular material mechanical properties the porosity affects the brash ice volume and therefore the buoyancy force the buoyancy affects the vessel frictional resistance which forms a significant part of the vessel total resistance in theory granular materials that consist of solid particles have a porosity of 40 mellor 1980 the values reported from full scale and model scale experiments are listed in table 1 the measured values indicate there is a considerable variation in porosity values in brash ice samples 7 60 however they are not inconsistent with the theoretical value therefore the theoretical value is chosen to be the representative value piece size and the piece size distribution of brash ice was considered as an interesting property as geometrical scaling is applied according to soil mechanics principles the soil piece size does not necessarily define the mechanical behavior of a material the piece shape might have a more significant effect on granular material behavior cabalar 2018 rodriguez 2013 but we did not study the piece shape effect in this study the piece size distribution affects pieces pile up and porosity a recent study by bonath et al 2019 investigated the brash ice full scale properties including the piece size distribution in the barents sea the channel was produced by repeating passages of two icebreakers and the brash ice thickness was measured to be between 0 5 m and 1 3 m which are close to the fsicr conditions and the channel conditions in the baltic sea in general they reported the brash ice piece size biggest dimension to have mean values between 19 cm standard deviation 26 cm and 27 cm stdev 26 cm depending on measurement this information of block size and block size distribution was utilized in our research as geometrical scaling is applied scale factor λ 17 5 the target mean piece size would be between 11 mm and 15 mm averaging in 13 mm the values reported by bonath et al are similar to karulina et al 2019 research which define the brash ice fragment size to be less than 30 cm and earlier full scale measurements reported by tuovinen 1979 angle of repose represents the steepest slope the material can be heaped without collapsing mehta and barker 1994 the angle is different above and below water the angle of repose below water affects the brash ice piling up at the vessel side the height of the friction surface and eventually the vessel frictional resistance the angle of repose being the steepest slope possible it is rarely measured in full scale instead there are several measurements from channel edge profiles and measurements from ridge keel and sail angles it can be assumed that these slope angles are smaller compared to the actual angle of repose limit angle however they provide information about nature brash ice pile up tendency table 2 summarizes the considered slope angle measurements the profile measurements from channel edges are utilized as it can be assumed the highest measured angles in channel edge brash ice piles are close to the angle of repose kannari 1982 reports channel profiles measured in the bay of bothnia to evaluate the angle of repose the steepest slopes were collected from each channel profile kankaanpää 1997 reports baltic sea pressure ridge sail angles based on previously mentioned channel profile measurements of kannari and ridge keel measurements of kankaanpää wilhelmson 1996 assumed the brash ice channel angle of repose below water to be 22 6 timco and burden 1997 collected information from 22 different sources according to timco and burden 1997 the above water angle of repose the sail angle was affected by the ridge location and the ridges were categorized in temperate and beaufort ridges our area of interest the baltic sea is included in temperate region here the chosen representative values for both above and below water are based on the extensive ridge research of timco and burden s we were unable to find any data for the less important above water angle measured from channel brash ice consequently the corresponding ridge value is used as representative value their below water value seems appropriate being similar to channels measurements of kannari 1982 compressibility describes the relationship between applied force and displacement and how water escapes from the brash ice when external load is applied tsytovich 1983 brash ice compressibility was proposed to relate to the mechanism by which the brash ice piles up around the moving ship hull compressibility was included in the list of measured parameters to enable a comparison of the model brash ice types in a literature review no research was found that studied compressibility in full scale internal friction angle as a part of evaluating the shear properties is a well established parameter within soil mechanics brash ice internal friction angle also affects the brash ice piling up around the ship hull and the submerging and displacement component of vessel brash ice channel resistance the relationship between the material shear strength and internal friction angle is commonly described using mohr coulomb law eq 1 eq 1 τ f c σ tan φ where c represents cohesion σ the applied normal load and φ the internal friction angle helenelund 1967 according to helenelund the soil shear strength consists of two separate parts the internal friction fragments friction with adjacent fragments and cohesion molecular interaction in nature intermediate soil types are also possible which shear strength consists of both parts but the cohesion part is predominant in fine grained saturated soils φ 0 whereas the shear strength of coarse grained materials consists practically completely of internal friction c 0 helenelund 1967 the principle of φ 0 concept is generally used in engineering practice to determination of the saturated clays shear strength green and marcuson 2014 as this difference between granular and fine grained materials has a principal impact on the physics behind the studied process the internal friction angle was applied to evaluate the material type and categorize different model ice materials in granular and fine grained materials this is specifically relevant as we are working with model ice which easily becomes a non granular material if traditional froude scaling is applied and the original ice piece strength is very low according to recent studies cabalar 2018 sezer et al 2011 the shear properties and the stress strain responses of the materials are influenced not only by the piece size distribution but also fragment shape assuming channel brash ice consists of round particles we can refer only to observations made from similar channels according to coulombs law a theoretical internal friction angle for completely granular brash ice would vary between 42 and 58 malmberg 1983 in soil mechanics shear strength is generally measured using a device called shear box in a shear box experiment a brash ice sample is placed in a box which consists of two separate halves one of the halves can be moved and the required shear load is recorded this kind of experiment is difficult to conduct in full scale since certain boundary conditions set requirements for the device size however to date several studies have exploited shear box measurements in the laboratory fransson and sandkvist 1985 urroz and ettema 1987 bruneau et al 1996 based on these previous studies the representative values were determined for the five parameters which were investigated in this study with the exception of compressibility due to lack of information these values are presented in table 3 3 methods 3 1 the tested brash ice types three different brash ice types were analyzed using the presented measurement procedures the main variation between the brash ice types was the parental ice flexural strength the model brash ice types were deliberately chosen so that they represent significantly different level of granularity to enable detecting the differences in the measured parameters the two first brash ice types with softer ice pieces were produced from fgx model ice which is used at aker arctic test basin the ice is fine grained and the water is doped with salt the target thickness is controlled by the water spraying duration after which the ice field is hardened in cold temperature until the desired strength properties are achieved after this the cold room temperature is warmed up to 4 c in which the level ice properties alteration is minimal the brash ice was produced by manually cutting a level ice sheet into small pieces fig 7 the target properties of the model ice sheets for investigation ice types 1 and 2 were chosen based on flexural strength in general in the level ice vessel model tests the ice flexural strength is a central parameter because the ice fails in bending the present type of fxg model ice cannot model all the ice parameters simultaneously consequently only either flexural strength or compressive strength can be modeled correctly during testing the ratio between model ice compressive strength and model ice flexural strength is significantly lower than it is in natural sea ice the ratio in model ice is close to 1 matala 2012 but compressive strength was not measured from parental model ice fields despite flexural strength not being a substantial parameter in broken ice we chose to use flexural strength as a target value because it relates to ice piece compressive strength the target flexural strength refers to the initial level ice sheet flexural strength the strength was not measured later from the ice pieces because the flexural strength is measured using cantilever beam method which cannot be applied in broken ice condition the target flexural strengths of model ice sheets were chosen to be 29 kpa and 57 kpa based on the tradition of using froude scaling method in vessel model testing the level ice sheet thickness was chosen so that the target brash ice thickness was reached when the level ice was broken into brash ice the third brash ice type did not consist of model ice but artificial fresh water ice fragments no strength properties were measured from ice fragments but the ice was assumed to correspond to fresh water ice characteristics with a flexural strength approximately 600 kpa and an unconfined horizontal compressive strength 3000 kpa cammaert and muggeridge 1988 the ice fragments had a tube like hollow shape shown in fig 8 these three brash ice types are referred later as type 1 2 and 3 respectively table 4 the brash ice target thickness was 68 mm all the brash ice measurements were conducted in channel brash ice before a vessel channel test the vessel channel test was conducted three times in each brash ice type the brash ice measurements were undertaken once before each vessel channel test this way the effect of brash ice getting submerged and the changes in texture due to ice handling could be evaluated on one of the test days the measurements of angle of repose compressibility and internal friction angle could only be conducted twice instead of three times due to technical problems 3 2 the brash ice measurement equipment and procedures in the experimental part of this study we measured five parameters 1 brash ice porosity 2 piece size distribution 3 angle of repose 4 compressibility and 5 internal friction angle the measurement procedures were presented in detail in international conference on port and ocean engineering under arctic conditions poac 2019 matala skogström it is desirable to conduct all the tests in as a short time window as possible to minimize the ice property changes which occur as a result of ice storing time this limits the number of different measurements that can be undertaken as well as the possibility of repeating single tests porosity 1 was measured according to international towing tank conference recommendations ittc 2014 in the measurement a known volume of brash ice is submerged using an instrumented box fig 9 the ice mass buoyancy is measured with a force transducer measuring the vertical force f required to hold the sample submerged prior to the measurement the force transducer is balanced to zero to eliminate the box mass from the equation the empty box buoyancy was determined by conducting a similar test in open water n ow the porosity can be calculated according to archimedes principle using equation 2 eq 2 p v v o i d v t o t a l 1 v i c e v t o t a l 1 f n o w ρ w ρ i c e g a h 1 f n o w ρ w ρ i c e g a h where p is the porosity of brash ice v void is the volume of void v total is the total volume of the sample v ice is the total volume of the ice f is the measured vertical force required to hold the box submerged n ow is the buoyancy of the empty box ρ w the density of water ρ ice the density of ice g the gravitational acceleration a the area of the box bottom and h the brash ice thickness this measurement procedure is commonly used and it is perceived as an accurate and repeatable method the porosity was measured from three different longitudinal coordinates close to channel start close to channel end and in the middle from each brash ice channel and the standard deviation of the measurements was defined based on these measurements the ice density was measured separately using ittc 2014 procedure in which an ice piece is submerged in a water container placed on a balance and the density is calculated based on the submerging weight equation 3 eq 3 ρ i c e ρ w w 2 w 1 w 3 w 1 where w 1 is the weight of the water container without ice sample w 2 is the weight with the ice sample floating freely in the water and w 3 is the weight with the ice sample submerged entirely in the water the piece size distribution 2 was evaluated using cameras and applying mathematical processing to the pictures the piece size distribution was defined by pouring a known volume of brash ice loosely on a gridded plate and taking a picture the grid functioned as a scale the picture was processed using matlab the program separated the white ice pieces defined the area of each ice piece by fitting a circle with the same area at the top of each ice piece and counted the amount of different sized ice pieces the size represents the diameter of the circle having similar area with the ice fragment the piece size distributions of different brash ice types were compared by determining the center of gravity from each distribution chart and comparing the mean piece size and standard deviation of the observed piece sizes the measurement was fast and easy to conduct the major drawback of this approach is that only white ice pieces were visible in the analysis and the procedure ignores the transparent slush like particles that is present specifically in soft model ice the angle of repose 3 was also measured using cameras both above and below water below water the angle was defined by filling a transparent box 300 mm 780 mm 280 mm with brash ice and pressing the ice mass towards one end and releasing the pressure gently so that the slope formed freely we assume that no limit thickness is achieved in a vessel channel test and therefore also the test evaluates the angle of resume as a material specific constant below the limit thickness the slope was photographed using underwater camera and the angle was determined from the picture afterwards fig 10 above water the angle of repose was determined by piling gently brash ice on an even plate letting the slope form freely and then taking a picture in a similar manner to below water procedure fig 11 compressibility 4 was measured using a special measuring box in the beginning of the measurement the box was set below water level and filled with brash ice the box was built from plexiglass one end plate functioned as a piston which moved forward when load was applied to the system see principle in fig 12 and the device in use in fig 13 the other end plate was perforated to allow water escape from the box the box lid was attached with hinges which enabled filling the box with brash ice the box cross sectional dimensions were 300 mm 280 mm and the original length before compression was 780 mm the load was applied to the system by hanging different weights into the cable system which transferred the load to the piston multiple loads were applied and the corresponding piston displacements were measured the data pairs were plotted in a chart there was some internal friction in the device and the piston started moving only after some original weights were applied to the system and at the end of the measurement the piston stopped moving because the brash ice reached the entirely compressed state therefore both the beginning and the end points were not used in the analysis and only values obtained when the piston was moving linearly were analyzed compressibility is evaluated using volume change equation in which the compression index λ c describes the volume change relation to logarithmic unit change of stress λ c d v d log σ mancuso et al 2012 see an example of analysis in fig 14 the angle of internal friction 5 is measured in soil mechanics by using a shear box the shear box concept was also applied in the measurement device which was developed for measuring brash ice angle of internal friction the measurement device is a transparent box which consists of two separate halves the lower box was fixed and the upper part could be moved using a force transducer the box lid is able to move in upright direction to enable applying different normal loads the device principle picture is presented in fig 15 in the measurement the box was set below water level and filled with brash ice the upper halve was moved and the required force was recorded the test was conducted several times with different normal loads so that the relation between normal load and shear stress could be detected fig 16 the purpose of this measure was to qualitatively evaluate the granularity of the material and therefore only the slope of this curve the internal friction angle is considered the analysis was done using shear box analysis procedures dang et al 2017 when the measurement starts the shear force increases with the horizontal displacement of the upper halve of the box until reaching a constant level however the device was found not to be sufficiently stiff to allow measuring the peak loads reliably and therefore the analysis was done based on the average level shear force reached an example of a measurement time history is presented in fig 17 4 results of brash ice measurements this chapter presents the results and findings of the study focusing on the three key questions 1 how does the studied parameter vary in different model brash ice materials 2 what is the measured values relation to parameter values in nature 3 how does the brash ice getting submerged as a result of material handling influence each parameter value each parameter s representative value in nature and their origins were introduced in the chapter 2 2 and summarized in table 3 considering the great number of different tests and the limited time window each test could be conducted only once in each brash ice channel with the exception of porosity which was tested three times in each channel 4 1 the results of porosity measurements the porosity measurement results are presented in table 5 and fig 18 the results indicate that the different brash ice types do have different porosity as stated in chapter 2 2 the porosity is affected by the granular material piece size distribution and the parameters cannot be viewed completely independently the piece size distribution is different for the ice types due to the brash ice cutting process the observed varying porosity is an important finding this is because even small variation in porosity have a significant effect in buoyancy force and eventually vessel frictional resistance in view of the small total number of measurements this might have limited the ability to identify trends between the different ice types ice type 3 fragments were tube like chapter 3 1 consequently the brash ice type 3 porosity values are not comparable to model ice values with regards ice type 3 the presence of the void inside the ice fragments is the cause of higher porosity values than what would be expected if the ice pieces were solid thus certain part of the ice type 3 void being inside the ice fragments instead of being between the fragments the effect to ice piece interaction might have been smaller than the numerical porosity value indicates the porosity values we measured varied between 30 0 and 55 1 and the porosity values of ice types 1 and 2 between 30 0 and 43 7 the representative value was set to a theoretical 40 given the variation of brash ice porosity in nature none of the tested ice types diverged significantly from the observed condition in nature the fsicr do not specify if the channel can be reconstructed for repeat model testing in the setting of repeat channel testing brash ice porosity was affected for brash ice types 1 and 2 soft model ice the repeat channel testing affects the amount of ice in the channel altering the vessel resistance in the brash ice channel this could be a consequence of increased amount of small slush like ice fragments which use space between solid ice fragments but which density is close to water density and therefore they have only marginally buoyancy the repeat testing had no effect on brash ice type 3 porosity 4 2 the results of piece size and piece size distribution measurements the piece size distribution histograms are presented in fig 19 each measurement of mean piece size and standard deviation are collected in table 6 and presented in fig 20 ice types 1 and 2 which represent model ice were cut into pieces manually which resulted in a significant variation in piece size the model brash ice piece size was larger than ice type 3 fragments especially the stronger model brash ice the ice type 2 produced significantly larger ice pieces than the other two brash ice types the model ice s cutting process that was used resulted in a significant variation in piece size during the manual cutting process it was found to be difficult to break the ice into fragments which were smaller than the ice sheet thickness which in our test series was 40 mm ice type 3 had smallest piece size and this ice type corresponds best to scaling for real world sea brash ice however during our study we also considered that modeling based on simple geometric scaling might not be the ideal method this is because the soft model ice easily becomes a non granular material when processed and cut into very small fragments consequently we prioritized the minimal processing over the small piece size as expected the repeating of the channel test did not affect the ice type 3 s piece size on repeat testing the greatest effect was seen on the piece size of ice type 2 the strong model ice why there is less changing in piece size with ice type 1 on repeat testing the softer model ice could possibly be explained by the fact that the soft model ice is originally very soft and therefore the ice pieces break into slush during the first testing process the ice pieces remaining in water during the repeat tests the strength of ice fragments is affected and it could be that ice type 2 properties approach softer ice type 1 over time this could also explain the smaller differential between repeated tests with soft model ice compared to stronger model ice 4 3 the results of angle of repose measurements the angle of repose measurement results are presented in table 7 the above water results are presented in fig 21 and below water results in fig 22 there is a significant difference in the angle of repose values with the different ice types it is important to reiterate that the representative value here refers to brash ice typical slope angle instead of the steepest limit angle the representative value being lower the ice type 3 proposed value 19 below water is within the representative value standard deviation our results show that the ice type with higher ice piece initial flexural strength is related to a lower angle of repose both above and below water why the softer ice types maintains a higher angle of reposes maybe explained by the cohesion between the ice pieces the soft ice pieces deform pile up and fasten upon the adjacent ice pieces in contrast the solid fresh water ice fragments stay unattached and show no interaction with the adjacent fragments the repeat channel testing resulted in an increase in the angle of reposes for both ice types 1 and 2 this might be due to the soft ice pieces tendency to adhere together the model brash ice pieces become wetter and softer during the repeat channel test which results in changes towards a softer slush like material when the tests with soft ice types 1 and 2 are repeated the below water repose angles approach 90 angles within the tested brash ice height a photograph of such 90 degree angle of repose is presented in fig 23 the ice type 3 angles of repose remained minimally changed in repeat tests 4 4 the results of compressibility measurements the compression index test results are presented in table 8 and fig 24 this test was undertaken to evaluate the water escape from the material under external load the analysis reveals the different order of magnitude in the compressibility index between ice types 1 and 2 model ice compared to ice type 3 strong ice fragments the water escapes easier from the brash ice type 3 how the water escapes from the brash ice affects the brash ice movement and pile up in the vessel sides and therefore a remarkable difference in the compressibility index should affect the vessel channel resistance the compression index testing device would require further development before the test results could be applied for quantitative purpose of other researchers the steps between the applied weights were not sufficient and more measurement points would have been needed to make more reliable analysis with smaller spread the test device limitations which were mentioned above do not allow the evaluation of the effect of repeat testing on compressibility 4 5 the results of internal friction angle measurements the shear box measurements results are analyzed comparing the internal friction angle values to evaluate the material granularity to be granular the internal friction angle should be theoretically about 42 58 the results are presented in table 9 and in fig 25 the measured internal friction angles from different ice types had a wide distribution of values when only considering the initial test results there was a significant variation in results the values varying between 21 9 and 35 9 the variation in results further increased with repeat channel testing technical issues with the testing device limited the numerical comparison of the results and therefore the measured negative internal friction angles should be interpreted with caution this is further discussed in the chapter 5 1 the value of this measurement is detecting the effect of test repeat which had a crucial effect on the model brash ice ice types 1 and 2 internal friction angle we conclude that neither soft nor strong model ice can be considered as a granular material after the first test run the ice type 3 the brash ice made of strong ice fragments remained granular in all three tests 5 discussion 5 1 the measuring equipment functionality overall all devices functioned well allowing evaluation of the different brash ice types on all the measured parameters the measurement results of porosity piece size and piece size distribution and angle of repose were of good quality and the results can be utilized in the later analysis of vessel channel tests the measurements were fast to conduct and the measured values were credible the compressibility and shear box measurement results allowed qualitative comparison of the ice types and they were able to reveal the different responses of the different brash ice types to provide more reliable numerical data for use of other researchers the measurement devices for compressibility and shear strength measurements would require further development there were limitations with the compressibility measurement device the mechanical weight based loading system should be replaced we would propose with a force transducer to enable a continuous measurement instead of datapoints that were collected using physical weights using a force transducer could also allow the evaluation of the brash ice reversion characteristics when the external load is released the shear box stiffness did not allow reliable measurement of peak values however the test was able to reveal the model ice tendency to become a non granular material during brash ice handling due to test repeat as the internal friction angle dropped close to zero after the first channel test this detail of the change of ice from a granular to a non granular material is relevant for later studies on model channel testing the numerical results were of insufficient quality to provide more understanding for the research polojärvi et al 2015 indicated in their shear box study that shear loads are results of force chains and therefore no definite shear strength value can be measured with shear box from brash ice as a consequence we have decided not to develop the shear strength measurement device further as part of our future brash ice channel test research as it has proven not to provide additional information in this investigation we acknowledge there are several potential sources of error the limited amount of testing and test results may be the main source of error given the great number of different parameter tests it was not possible to repeat individual tests on this occasion another potential source of error is the fact that ice as a material has a wide scatter in properties consequently this may represent error or alternatively reflect the natural spread in nature however as the measurements were systemically undertaken to a specified methodology all of the measurements and results provide information about the differences between the brash ice types 5 2 main differences between tested brash ice types the difference in the tested ice types 1 2 and 3 target properties was the ice pieces original flexural strength the artificial fresh water ice ice type 3 had a distinctly different geometrical form from the model ice types ice types 1 and 2 the ice piece strength properties are affected by repeating the channel test the changes to the ice fragment strength properties are caused by both the additional ice handling to rearrange the ice channel for the following test and the model channel test itself which makes the ice pieces wetter softer and reshapes the ice pieces the observed interaction between the ice particles was different in the three ice types ice particle interaction is affected by surface frictional properties the transformation of ice pieces during the interaction and by the presence of small slush like particles these factors had a major effect on repeat testing of ice types 1 and 2 characteristics but there was no influence on ice type 3 the reason for no change in ice type 3 results on repeat testing was the fact that the solid ice pieces of ice type 3 did not change because of the ice handling and therefore the brash ice characteristics also remained similar to the first test run despite the repeat testing in addition to ice type 3 ice fragment being initially very strong the ice type 3 does not contain any additional dope like salt or alcohol which might also influence the transformation tendency 5 3 observations from measured brash ice parameters measured from different brash ice types the nature of ice is that it has characteristics which can vary widely which can make analysis complicated and difficult the following summarizes the observations made from our recent study 1 different porosity values were found with each of the three different brash ice types 2 the amount of void increased when the model test was repeated in originally very soft model ice ice type 1 3 whilst our piece size distribution measurement was not able to measure the smallest transparent fragment that exist in the brash ice in nature and in the brash ice types 1 and 2 this slush like medium undoubtedly affects the brash ice behavior and eventually the vessel resistance in brash ice the presence of small particle significantly changes ice particle interaction compared to the situation in which practically no small particles exist in the medium in the ice type 3 conceivably this slush like material is similar in full scale and model scale and the other properties being scaled the slush effect in model scale is prominent 4 the angle of repose varied significantly between all three ice types when the ice types 1 and 2 became soft and slush like there was more cohesion between the pieces to maintain higher angles of reposes 5 the compressibility test revealed that the water escape requires significantly greater load for ice type 1 and 2 compared to ice type 3 6 the model brash ice altered in structure from a granular to a non granular material for ice types 1 and 2 on repeat testing ice type 3 which had a significantly higher initial ice piece solidity compared to model ice types remained granular in repeat testing 7 the initial solidity of model ice types 1 and 2 became negligible when the ice was handled several times and the model ice types became similar non granular materials when repeating the tests the observations are summarized in table form to assist in evaluating the ice types as a whole table 10 summarizes the observations by arranging the tested ice types based on their relation to the representative values in nature table 11 shows the test repeat effect on each parameter related to the tested ice types these findings help us to understand ice fragment interaction in brash ice the measured numerical values of compressibility and internal friction angle must be interpreted with caution due to limited accuracy of the measurements the presented results are significant in at least two major respects first this study has identified the significance of ice piece interaction in model brash ice second this study has proven there is a need for better standardization of model tests involving brash ice 6 conclusion this study focuses solely on brash ice properties the ultimate goal of this research is to improve current understanding of brash ice behavior around a moving ship hull and to enable the further development of effective and standardized model testing procedures five brash ice parameters were investigated in model test experiments in three different model brash ice types and the results were analyzed related to three factors 1 the model brash ice type 2 the parameter value in nature and 3 the order number of test repeat all three model ice types were justified based on the current model test practices to enable detecting differences in the model brash ice the brash ice types were intentionally chosen to represent very different level of ice piece separation each model brash ice type represents different level of how loose separate easily transformable or solid the ice fragments are in water the evidence derived from this study suggest that different ice types have different properties covering all the five parameters investigated in this study this indicates there is a need for better model brash ice standardization to secure consistent channel model test results the results also indicate that model ice ice types 1 and 2 properties undergo significant changes when the tests are repeated a proposed explanation for the differences between the ice types is that less solid model ice types 1 and 2 are exposed for increased ice piece interaction which contributes to ice block metamorphosis increased friction and even merging of separate ice blocks this ice piece interaction is significantly less or non existent when the ice pieces are originally more solid mellor 1980 points out that very fine grained cohesive material is present in brash ice in nature the slush like material mellor describes appears to be similar to the slush like material we observed when we conducted our model testing with soft model ice ice types 1 and 2 the influence of this slush is prominent on model tests because other properties are being appropriately scaled we also observed that soft model ice could lose the intended granular nature and become a non granular material during the channel testing which certainly influences the channel test outcomes our brash ice property observations show that the studied different model brash ice types have different ice fragment interaction and therefore they are expected to behave in a different manner around a moving ship hull furthermore our findings encourage the evaluation of the use of froude scaling in model tests conducted in broken ice which is currently a common practice this is because the scaled down strength properties make the brash ice pieces less solid and as a consequence alter the test conditions further consideration regarding the role of fragment shape effect on brash ice properties would be worthwhile declaration of competing

20967,for a floating tidal current turbine power station the motion response of the floating carrier would affect the hydrodynamic performance of the tidal current turbine to study the turbine loads and power output characteristics of the proposed twin rotor turbine in moving condition the hydrodynamic performance of a vertical axis twin rotor turbine in surge motion is thoroughly discussed in this manuscript based on the moving mesh and sliding mesh technique the rotary motion and surge motion of the turbine are combined to simulate the turbine operation conditions in waves and currents the twin rotor turbine working at different surge frequencies surge amplitudes and tip speed ratios is simulated and the simulation results are compared with the fixed turbine in an uniform flow the change characteristics of thrust force lateral force and flow field are analyzed the results show that the twin rotor can improve the power output efficiency better than a stand alone turbine surge frequency and surge amplitude have very little influence on the average power output of the turbine the fluctuation amplitude of the thrust and lateral forces of a twin rotor turbine is larger than the stand alone turbine while the fluctuation amplitude of thrust and lateral forces increase with surge amplitude and frequency spectra of turbine loads and power output show that surge and rotation frequencies have different impacts on the dynamics and performances of the turbine the research results can provide a reference for the development of floating tidal current power stations in the future keywords tidal current energy vertical axis twin rotor turbine hydrodynamic performance forced oscillation 1 introduction tidal current energy represents a significant kind of marine renewable energy resource and has attracted attention from researchers worldwide due to its predictability sustainability widespread distribution and high energy density zhang and li 2016 tidal current turbines are one of the most important devices for capturing tidal current energy tidal current turbines can convert the kinetic energy of tides and currents into mechanical energy and use the generator to produce electricity ma et al 2016 according to the main shaft structure of the tidal current turbine tidal current turbines can be divided into horizontal axis tidal turbines hatts and vertical axis tidal turbines vatts a vatt represents a vital kind of tidal current turbine and has the advantages of a simple design compact gear transmission design low seal requirement and low noise li et al 2011 wang et al 2004 compared with the slow development of vertical axis wind turbines in the wind energy industry vatts are obtaining new opportunities in marine renewable energy development to date hatts account for 43 of the prototypes in industry demonstrations while vatts account for 33 uihlein and magagna 2016 some researchers have suggested that twin rotor tidal current turbines could be a better format for capturing tidal current energy among various kinds of vatts since the average power outputs of twin rotor tidal current turbines is larger than those of stand alone turbines ma et al 2018 several precommercial prototypes in fig 1 of twin rotor tidal current turbines have been reported in the literature or in the demonstration phase such as the marine current turbine mct stanford

horizontal axis twin rotor turbine qingdao china guo 2013 and hai neng ⅲ vertical axis twin rotor turbine dai shan china jing 2013 in fig 1 a b are fixed type twin rotor tidal current turbines while c f are floating type twin rotor tidal current turbines the platforms carrying the twin rotor tidal current turbine can be classified as ⅰ floating mooring platforms ⅱ pile mounted platforms and ⅲ sea bed mounted or gravity based platforms compared with the other two types of platforms the floating mooring platform has the advantages of ⅰ the floating moored systems are easy to install maintain and remove ⅱ the floating mooring platform has simpler maintenance schedules and ⅲ the floating mooring platform is preferred at locations where the sea bed is mostly stone with deeper sea conditions since the current speed decreases with increasing sea depth the floating turbine can easily capture the kinetic energy of sea surface currents the pile mounted system is practical for deep water conditions 30 60 m and the structure is very rigid the sea bed mounted platform and gravity based platform are best for shallow water where the effects from waves and wind are minimal zhang et al 2013 several pilot floating twin rotor tidal current turbines located worldwide are listed in table 1 most of these turbines are still in the demonstration phase and are still far from business applications the floating catamaran is a promising carrier among various kinds of floating mooring platforms floating catamarans have the advantages of a large deck area convenient maintenance and deployment and strong adaptability to water depth and complex sea bed topography fig 1 shows the tidal current power station hai neng ⅰ which was developed by harbin engineering university and currently operates in the gui shan water channel dai shan county jing et al 2014 the rated power output of hai neng ⅰ is 2 150 kw and hai neng ⅰ can provide electricity to guan shan island through a submarine cable the successful operation of hai neng ⅰ lays the foundation of hai neng ⅱ and hai neng ⅲ the rated power outputs of hai neng ⅱ and hai neng ⅲ are 2 100 kw and 2 300 kw respectively until now the existing literature on twin rotor tidal current turbines under moving conditions has been very limited investigations of twin rotor tidal current turbines have mostly been conducted under fixed conditions li and sander proposed a vortex method based on the traditional discrete vortex method dvm to study such a system li and calışal 2010 li and calisal 2011 the influence of the relative rotation direction corotating or counterrotating and relative distance between the twin rotors on the hydrodynamic performance was investigated the results showed that the relative efficiency of a twin rotor tidal current turbine could be 25 higher than that of a stand alone turbine the counterrotating direction could achieve higher power output efficiency compared with the other rotation directions in our published paper we conducted research on the hydrodynamic interactions between the two rotors ma et al 2018 the power output efficiency of the twin rotor tidal current turbine decreased when the relative distance exceeded a critical value the wake behind each rotor had the tendency to merge when the two rotors were too close to each other this closeness would result in a blockage effect for the incoming flow which led to a decrease in the power output for the twin rotor tidal current turbine stefania conducted a two dimensional cfd computational fluid dynamics analysis of the hydrodynamic interactions among three closely spaced vatts with a side by side layout and a triangular layout zanforlin 2018 the results showed that the side by side layout could increase the average power output efficiency in a wide range of incoming flow directions compared with the triangular layout however those studies did not consider the influence of floating platform motion on the hydrodynamics of the turbine in the presence of waves and currents researchers have studied the hydrodynamic performance changes of fixed stand alone turbines in the presence of waves and currents barltrop et al combined linear wave theory with blade element theory and established a mathematical model to solve the dynamic problems associated with marine current turbines barltrop et al 2007 the simulation results agreed well with the experimental results and the mathematical model could analyze the wave current interactions for marine current turbines in 2012 milne et al carried out a towing tank test to simulate the unsteady hydrodynamic loads of turbine blades subjected to waves and turbulence milne et al 2013 phenomena associated with dynamic stalling were observed the blade load could be 25 larger than that of the turbine in a steady uniform flow in 2013 ethan et al carried out a towing tank test to study the influence of surface waves on the performance of a scaled marine current turbine lust et al 2013 the experimental results were consistent with the computational results of bem blade element momentum theory the influences of different immersion depths and wave parameters on the hydrodynamics of the turbine were monitored during the experiment the presence of waves had very little influence on the average thrust and power output however the thrust and power output reached a maximum with the passing of the wave crest and a minimum with the passing of the wave trough they concluded that a significant change in power output might lead to poor electrical power quality and a significant change in thrust might increase the risk of fatigue failure yan et al established a computational free surface flow framework to study the hydrodynamic performance of horizontal axis tidal stream turbines subjected to free surface flow yan et al 2017 the thrust and power coefficients exhibited time periodic behavior which was consistent with the wave frequency the average thrust and power coefficients decreased as the immersion depth declined however the above results were all obtained under the assumption that the turbine is fixed in waves and currents for a twin rotor tidal current turbine mounted on a catamaran the catamaran may generate periodic motion in the presence of waves and currents thus the flow field around the turbine also changes due to motion the dynamic load behavior of the twin rotor tidal current turbine would be very different from the fixed situation x guo et al 2018 the periodic motions have a negative influence on the hydrodynamics and fatigue life of the twin rotor tidal current turbine guo et al 2018 brown et al 2020 due to the lack of relative research results and literature existing stand alone turbines and twin rotor tidal current turbines often adopt conservative designs to reduce the risk of fatigue failure and structural damage holst et al 2015 however the motion response of twin rotor tidal current turbines in a real sea environment is very complicated in addition due to complex geometric shapes it is too complicated to directly study the hydrodynamic performances of most floating power stations when subjected to waves and currents therefore we make the following assumptions 1 the twin rotor tidal current turbine is fixed to the catamaran though the main shaft and the main shaft is fixed on the catamaran 2 the whole system moves harmonically 3 the immersion depth of the twin rotor tidal current turbine is deep enough so that the waves have no influence on the incoming current speed of the turbine in this paper the hydrodynamic simulation of the twin rotor turbine in surge motion induced by the floating platform is carried out in ansys cfx ansysinc 2010 the rotary motion and surge motion of the turbine are combined to simulate the turbine s moving condition in the presence of waves and currents based on the moving mesh and sliding mesh techniques the cfd method can reflect the influence of the turbulent flow and viscosity of water on the hydrodynamic performances of tidal turbines harrison et al 2010 the results of the cfd method are more accurate than those of the potential flow theory and researchers can know more details regarding the wake flow which could benefit the understanding and research of the hydrodynamic mechanism for turbines a sliding mesh and moving mesh are adopted in the numerical simulations the influence of the tip speed ratio tsr surge frequency and surge amplitude on the hydrodynamic performance of the twin rotor tidal current turbine is investigated due to the complexity of the 6 degree of freedom motion simulation only surge motion induced by platform motion is considered in this study 2 twin rotor turbine and cfd modeling 2 1 introduction to the π type vertical axis twin rotor tidal current turbine a π type vertical axis twin rotor tidal current turbine which is carried by a catamaran is introduced in this study fig 2 the layout plan of the twin rotor system is similar to the greek letter π and the incoming flow direction is assumed to be perpendicular to the middle line between the two rotors the overall configuration of the twin rotor system is a π type structure consisting of two vertical axis tidal current turbines the two rotors rotate in the opposite direction the twin rotor tidal current turbine adopts a modular design including a main supporting frame turbine blade hub spider waterproof disc main shaft and electric power control system the main supporting frame is used to support the twin rotor tidal current turbine and the relative distance between the two rotors can be adjusted the air foil of the blade is naca0018 the diameter of the turbine can be adjusted by the tapping hole set on the supporting arm three supporting arms are connected by a three slipper pretensioner to enhance structural stability the twin rotor tidal current turbine has the following advantages the simple structure of the turbine is less expensive for manufacturing the twin rotor tidal current turbine can operate at wide ranges of water depths and has a stronger ability to adapt to the complex sea environment the hub spiders holding the blades are above the water level which can reduce flow field disturbance the cantilever straight blade has no other additional components below the water level thus causing less influence on the flow field which benefits the energy capture of the turbine in addition the cantilever straight blade reduces the risk of water plant and fish net entanglement the cantilever blade design is convenient for installation maintenance marine foul cleaning operations and other offshore operations long term operation costs for such a system are low since all the components of the π type twin rotor tidal current turbine are above the water level except for the blades the waterproofing difficulty is highly reduced the seawater corrosion effect on the twin rotor tidal current turbine has been highly reduced which promotes the reliability of such a system 2 2 turbine load analysis as shown in fig 3 the blade load parallel to the flow direction is defined as thrust while the blade load vertical to the flow direction is defined as the lateral force thrust f x and lateral force f y of the turbine are defined by 1 where d r is the drag force of a single blade chordwise l is the lifting force chordwise α is the attack angle θ is the position angle of the blade and ϕ is the pitch angle of the blade the torque q of a single blade to the rotation center of the turbine can be expressed as follows 2 q f t r m o r l sin α ϕ d r cos α ϕ m o where m o is the torque of a single blade to a fixed point o x 1 y 1 on the blade r is the diameter of the turbine and f t is the tangential force of a single blade m o can be expressed in the following equation 3 m o f x y 1 f y x 1 d r x 1 cos α ϕ y 1 sin α ϕ l x 1 sin α ϕ y 1 cos α ϕ where x 1 and y 1 are the coordinate values of the blade foil center the above derivation results are the load of a single blade for a turbine the total load acting on the turbine could be obtained by adding all the turbine blades together 4 f x θ f x 1 θ f x 2 θ f x z θ i 1 z f x 1 θ z 1 2 π z f y θ f y 1 θ f y 2 θ f y z θ i 1 z f y 1 θ z 1 2 π z q θ q 1 θ q 2 θ q z θ i 1 z q 1 θ z 1 2 π z where z is the number of

setup of the twin rotor turbine the three dimensional flow around the turbine is assumed to be incompressible and unsteady in absolute rectangular coordinates the basic governing equations to describe the transient flow can be expressed as follows continuity equation 10 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 navier stokes equation momentum equation 11 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j s i where ρ is the water density u is the velocity p is the pressure t is the time x is the spatial coordinate μ is the kinetic viscosity and s is the source term despite the fact that equation 11 can be used to describe the turbulence flow it is difficult to directly solve equation 11 due to the high pulsation characteristics of the turbulence nonlinear characteristic of the n s equation and diversity of the turbine boundary condition wang 2005 thus the time average method is often used by researchers to simplify turbulence fluctuations the rans reynolds average navier stokes equation originated from the time average method the rans equations were used to model the turbulent flow because they are relatively simple and more computationally economical than other approaches such as direct numerical simulation dns and large eddy simulation les moreover the rans results are widely accepted in the published literature for predicting the hydrodynamic loads of turbines turnock et al 2011 afgan et al 2013 batten

equation is not closed to solve the flow field around the turbine a corresponding turbulence model should be adopted some turbulence models are widely used in solving the flow field i e k ε k ω sst shear stress turbulence reynolds stress model les and dns in 1994 the sst model was developed by menter 1994 for the numerical simulation of tidal current turbines the sst turbulence model is frequently adopted by many researchers afgan et al 2013 liu et al 2016 shives and crawford 2016 the sst model combines the advantages of k ε and k ω the k ω model is adopted in the inner region of the boundary layer and switches to the standard k ε model in the outer region and free shear flows the sst model shows a good performance in the simulation of the flow separation and flow domain with a reverse pressure gradient catalano pointed out that the k ω sst model could better simulate the stalling characteristics of the airfoil and cost less computational time catalano and tognaccini 2010 the sst turbulent model is adopted in the simulation the sst shows advantages in capturing complex boundary layer flows under adverse pressure gradients or simulating flow separation many researchers have adopted the sst model to simulate vatt the sst model has been proven to be accurate by many researchers in simulating rotation fluid machinery afgan et al 2013 masters et al 2015 shives and crawford 2016 liu et al 2016 ahmed et al 2017 the computational domain of the twin rotor tidal current turbine simulation with surge motion is shown in fig 4 and fig 6 the incoming flow is parallel to the x axis the whole computational domain is divided into the steady domain the rotation domain and the surging domain the three domains are connected by an interface the motion of the rotation domain and the surging domain are sinusoidal and only the surge motion is applied to the twin rotor turbine the rotation domain rotates inside the surging domain and the rotation domain acts as the subdomain of the surging domain the surging domain and steady domain are connected by an interface this kind of setup can reduce the mesh deformation and guarantee the calculation accuracy table 2 shows the boundary conditions and wall functions used for the numerical simulation the surging law can be expressed by ξ ξ 0 sin ω t ξ 0 is the surge amplitude and ω is the surge frequency the surge motion of the turbine is realized by the dynamic mesh technique the rotation of the rotor is controlled by cel cfx expression language the dynamic mesh and sliding mesh techniques are used to control the motion of the mesh a structured mesh is adopted in the computational simulation compared with the unstructured mesh the structured mesh shows more advantages in terms of convergence speed and accuracy in the numerical simulation mcnaughton et al 2014 different grid topologies are used in the computational domain the rotation domain adopts the o grid method fig 5 and fig 6 while the static domain adopts the h grid and o grid method this strategy allowed for a smooth transition of the mesh geometry from the circular disk regions to the rectangular tunnel cross section thus circumventing the increase in grid nonorthogonality or skewness of the grid cells in the cfx setup the convergence criterion is set to a root mean square rms of less than 1 0 10 4 in the transient simulation of the twin rotor turbine the transient solver is set to be at least two iterations within each time step while the maximum number of iterations should be less than 10 within each time step the high resolution second order backward euler scheme is adopted to discretize the transient term ensuring implicit time discretization a larger mesh density has a positive effect in terms of improving the numerical simulation accuracy however the numerical simulation needs to maintain a balance between the simulation accuracy and time consumption the most important part of the hydrodynamic performance analysis for the vatt is the flow field simulation around the turbine blade research results regarding the mesh thickness around the turbine blade can be seen in many studies lanzafame et al 2014 it is effective to simulate the flow field around the turbine blade when y 5 a mesh refinement near the walls of the turbine blades was set to fully capture the interactions between the fluid and the turbine blades as presented in fig 5 the surface of the blade is set as a no slip wall and the blade surface is influenced by the fluid friction force the outer sidewall adopts a free slip wall and the wall is not influenced by the fluid friction force 2 4 effectiveness verification to verify the effectiveness of the two dimensional simulation the numerical simulation results are compared with the circulation water tunnel experiment results turbine and test apparatus the turbine used in this experiment was a three bladed vertical axis turbine measuring 0 8 m in diameter the chord length of the blade was 0 12 m the air foil of the turbine blade was naca0018 detailed parameters of the turbine are shown in table 3 the blades were mounted on a tapered beam and the tapered beam was connected to a nacelle fig 7 and fig 8 the nacelle was connected to a flange plate the flange plate was connected to the main shaft of the turbine there were two encoders namely the absolute encoder and incremental encoder mounted on the main shaft to monitor the phase angle and instantaneous angular velocity of the turbine the torque of the turbine was transmitted to the horizontally mounted generator according to the bevel gear and the horizontal shaft a speed torque meter was mounted in the middle of the horizontal shaft to measure the speed and torque of the turbine circulation water tunnel the experiment of the vertical axis cantilever turbine was carried out in the circulation water tunnel at harbin engineering university which measures 17 3 m long 6 2 m wide and 2 8 m deep the tunnel features a horizontal circulation pump that can produce uniform water flow at a velocity range of 0 2 5 m s the circulation water tunnel is also equipped with a wave absorber capable of making the stationary wave height smaller than 7 mm when the water velocity is below 1 5 m s a two dimensional numerical simulation method is adopted to compute the hydrodynamics of the twin rotor tidal current turbine for this specific turbine in this study there are no extra connecting arms or main shaft below the water surface which lays a good foundation for the two dimensional numerical simulation of the proposed turbine a three dimensional model is required for some special purposes such as calculating the vertical flow fluctuation i e the flow fluctuation in the z direction studying the arm effects etc for turbine designers in the initial design stage because the computational time of the three dimensional model is more than thirty times that of the two dimensional model it can be said that the two dimensional model is more cost effective than the three dimensional model however due to the inherent defects of the two dimensional numerical simulations of vatts e g infinite span length of the blade and infinite water depth mannion et al 2018 the flow divergence is constrained over the top and bottom of the vertical axis tidal turbine lam and peng 2016 thus two dimensional numerical simulation tends to overestimate the power output of the vertical axis turbine by using fully turbulent rans models lanzafame et al 213 yang and lawn 2013 previous published literature has discussed the influence of the span ratio and arm installation location on the hydrodynamic performance of vatts the power output reduction coefficient for different arm locations and different span ratios was provided in li and calisal 2010 marsh et al 2015 2017 to verify the feasibility of the 2d numerical simulation for the vertical axis turbine the turbine power output efficiency and blade loads are compared between the experimental and computational results as fig 9 shows the power output efficiencies of the two dimensional numerical simulation results are larger than those of the experimental results to eliminate the overestimation of turbine power by 2d numerical simulation a reduction coefficient should be applied to correct the power output efficiency then due to the unique structure of the turbine blade there is no connecting arm or main shaft below the water surface only a correction considering the span ratio effect is applied the ratio of turbine height and radius h r for this turbine is 2 125 li s work li and calisal 2010 documented that the power output efficiency can decrease by as much as 6 5 when the h r of the vatt is 2 125 thus the power output reduction factor for this specific turbine would be 0 935 therefore the power output efficiency results for cfx are multiplied by the reduction factor and then the correction curve is obtained the correction curve reaches the maximum power output at approximately 2 3 the cyclic variation tendency of the correction curve agreed well with the experimental results the deviation between the correction curve and experimental curve is below 4 when the three dimensional effect is considered the difference between the exp curve and correction curve is acceptable to further verify the feasibility of the two dimensional numerical simulations the blade load computational results obtained by cfx are compared with the experimental results from strickland the specific turbine parameters in the strickland experiment are documented in table 4 the overall variation trends of the computational results agree well with the experimental results over a given period except when the angle ranges from 180 360 in fig 10 the tangential force is generally an order of magnitude smaller than the normal force and is thus much more subject to experimental error and extraneous noise since the two dimensional numerical simulations ignored the three dimensional effect and blade vortex shedding effect over the top and bottom of the turbine blade the overall cyclic variation tendency is well correlated for the experiment and numerical simulation therefore the two dimensional numerical simulation method can be applied to simulate the turbine loads and power output efficiency notably the introduction of the reduction factor verifies the effectiveness and feasibility of the two dimensional numerical simulation for the vertical axis twin rotor tidal current turbine no such correction is applied to the following numerical simulations the accurate prediction of turbine power output is not the main focus of this manuscript and the overestimation of the power output of the turbine will not influence the following study of the turbine the overestimation of the power output for the turbine will not change the fluctuation characteristics of the load and power output in the following numerical simulations nor will it change the frequency characteristics of the turbine load and power output 3 numerical simulation of a twin turbine system without oscillation the simulation of the hydrodynamic performance of the twin turbine system in a uniform flow is carried out in this section the relative distance between the two rotors is 12 m 1 5d as fig 11 shows the upper rotor rotates counterclockwise and the lower rotor rotates clockwise this kind of rotation can counteract the influence of the lateral force and increase the power output efficiency jang et al 2016 for the sake of decreasing the load fluctuation of the turbine the initial phase angles of the two rotors are both set as 0 the incoming flow v e is 3 m s the angular velocities of the upper and lower rotors are ω and ω respectively several tsrs have been selected in the simulation i e 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 and 4 0 c p 1 is the average power output coefficient of the lower rotor c p 2 is the average power output coefficient of the upper rotor c p is the average power output efficiency of the twin turbine system as shown in fig 12 a the average power output efficiency of the twin turbine is very close to that of the single turbine at a low tsr the power output efficiency of the twin rotor system is larger than that of the single turbine when the tip speed ratio is close to the optimal tsr when the tsr is equal to 2 0 the average power output coefficient of the twin rotor turbine is 15 3 higher than that of the single turbine the mutual interference between the twin rotors can indeed increase the power output efficiency which is consistent with the result in the existing literature dyachuk et al 2012 the power output efficiency increases for the twin rotor turbine at larger tsrs first when the turbine is operating at a low tsr the turbine generates flow separation and dynamic stalling the benefit of mutual interactions between the two rotors is not obvious second as seen in the velocity magnitude maps fig 12 b an increase in tsr leads to a reduction in the turbine permeability making the turbine increasingly similar to a bluff body as revealed by the wake shortening and the growth of wake instabilities far downstream compared with the contour of the stand alone turbine the high flow velocity area dramatically increased for the twin rotor turbine at high tsrs additionally the flow in the middle is accelerated when the tsr increases for the twin rotor turbine at a low tsr the high flow velocity area yellow spots tsr 1 5 in the middle is dispersed while the high flow velocity area at a high tsr is more concentrated and larger tan spots in the middle tsr 3 0 and being accelerated at the same time thus leading to the power output that increases at a high tsr similar results can also be found in zanforlin 2018 zanforlin and nishino 2016 fig 13 and fig 14 show the average dimensionless thrust coefficient and torque coefficient of the twin rotor turbine when the tip speed ratio is 2 0 the thrust and torque change periodically compared with stand alone turbines in an uniform flow multiple frequencies are seen in the time history of the twin rotor turbine loads the difference is caused by the mutual interactions between the two rotors an immediate effect of the narrow separation between the two rotors is that tip vortices shed from a rotor can impinge each other triggering unsteadiness for the turbine load in addition when the two rotors are deployed in close proximity the flow between the two rotors is accelerated due to the blockage effect which in turn increases the velocity fluctuation acting on the turbine blade clary et al 2020 nevertheless the fluctuation amplitude of the thrust is small and the upper envelope curve of the thrust is an approximately straight line the lateral force coefficient fluctuates more severely than the thrust the average value of the lateral force coefficient is equal to 0 0068 compared with a stand alone turbine system the motion response of a carrier carrying such a twin rotor system can be reduced 4 numerical simulation of the twin turbine system with oscillation 4 1 verification of the mesh size and time step the mesh size and time step independence tests are essential for the accuracy of numerical simulations fertahi et al 2018 satrio et al 2018 therefore the independent verifications of mesh size and time step should be carried out in the initial stage three different time steps and three different mesh cases are carried out to determine the optimal time step and mesh parameters all the verification cases employ the same surge motion parameters the surge amplitude is 1 m while the surge frequency is 1 rad s the mesh parameters are shown in table 5 the parameters of the time steps are shown in table 6 fig 15 and fig 16 show the time history of torque a single turbine for three different meshes and three different time steps respectively as shown in fig 15 the results of the medium mesh case nearly coincide with the fine mesh quality case moreover the fine mesh case requires 38 more time than the medium mesh case the coarse mesh case requires only the minimum time in the simulation however the torque of the coarse mesh quality case is quite different from that of the other two cases therefore the medium mesh quality has already met the mesh independent standard as shown in fig 16 case 1 nearly coincides with case 2 the computational time of case 1 is 52 longer than that of case 2 furthermore the torque of case 3 is obviously larger than that of the other two cases compared with case 2 case 3 saves only 26 of the computational time for the purpose of efficiency and accuracy the time step in case 2 is selected in the following simulations 4 2 influence of the tip speed ratio several different tsrs are selected during the simulation i e 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 and 3 5 the surge amplitude and surge frequency remain constant under different tsrs the surge motion parameters are shown in table 7 fig 17 shows the average power output coefficient of the twin turbine under two different scenarios i e turbine with surge motion turbine without surge motion compared with the twin rotor turbine without surge motion the varying tendencies of the power output of the two scenarios are nearly the same the oscillation of the twin rotor system has very little effect on the location of the optimal tsr the optimal tsr is always approximately 2 0 however the power output of the turbine with surge motion is slightly larger than that of the turbine without surge motion at high tsrs while the power output at low tsrs is nearly the same for a turbine with surge motion the incoming flow velocity acting on the turbine is the sum of the flow velocity v e and surge velocity ξ 0 ω cos ω t therefore the actual transient tsr of the turbine always changes when the turbine is in surge motion fig 18 and fig 19 show the power output time history of a single turbine at two different tsrs in a surge motion period the power output phase relationships of the turbine with surge motion and the turbine without surge motion are nearly the same but the magnitudes are quite different when the surge velocity is positive the turbine moves downstream when the value of the surge displacement is positive the turbine is downstream when the location surge displacement is 0 the turbine is at the equilibrium position when the turbine starts moving downstream there is a negative power output for both cases at this time the surge velocity acting on the blade is the largest and the surge velocity direction is opposite to the incoming flow direction which leads to a sharp decrease in power output when the surge velocity is close to 0 the power output curves of the turbine with surge motion and the turbine without surge motion are nearly coincident with each other when the turbine starts moving upstream the surge motion velocity increases the actual flow velocity acting on the blade which leads to an increase in the power output of the turbine with increasing tsr the fluctuation rate of the power output is more obvious and more wave crests and wave troughs can be seen in a surge motion period additionally the power output increase resulting from the negative surge velocity at a higher tsr is larger than that at a low tsr which may lead to a slight power output increase at a higher tsr for the turbine in surge motion to further investigate the thrust coefficient and lateral force coefficient are also analyzed μ 0 t μ d t t is defined as the average load of the turbine μ ˆ μ max μ min is defined as the fluctuation amplitude of the turbine load as shown in fig 20 and fig 21 the fluctuation amplitude of the thrust and lateral force coefficients of the twin rotor turbine are proportional to the tsr and both increase with the tsr the average lateral force coefficient does not change with the tsr since the lateral force directions for the two rotors are opposite the average lateral force of the twin rotor turbine slightly fluctuates at approximately 0 the fluctuation amplitude of the lateral force increases with the tsr obviously the frequency of the turbine load and power output efficiency of the twin rotor turbine with surge motion can be divided into two main components i e one component is related to the rotation frequency and the other component is related to the surge motion frequency however in the published literature it is not clearly discussed how the rotation frequency and oscillation frequency influence the turbine load and power output efficiency a spectrum analysis of turbine load can transform the complex time varying load curve into a clear frequency spectrum figure which makes it easier to analyze the frequency of turbine load components the fast fourier transform fft method is used to analyze the turbine load and power output characteristics in this study the frequency of turbine loads and power outputs are first investigated considering the spectral density of the thrust lateral force and power output efficiency defined by eqs 7 9 these spectra are plotted in the following figures for different tsrs surge frequencies and surge amplitudes those spectra are plotted against frequency the time series duration used to compute these spectral densities is 128 s for convenience ffr and ffo are defined as the fundamental frequencies of rotation and surge motion respectively the fundamental frequency of the twin rotor turbine ffr is the inverse of the rotation period the fundamental frequency of the oscillation ffo is the inverse of the surge motion period for the twin rotor turbine with forced sinusoidal motion the frequencies of the turbine load in the spectrum should be the integer multiple of the fundamental frequencies or the superposition of fundamental frequencies fig 22 and fig 23 show the spectra of the thrust and lateral forces for the twin rotor turbine at different tsrs multiple specific peaks are observed in the load and power output spectra for different tsrs for convenience these peaks have been labeled in the spectrum the two highest peaks found for different tsrs are peak ⅰ and peak ⅱ which take place at 2 and 4 times the ffr detailed parameters for the two peaks are shown in table 8 ffr is also labeled in the spectrum the response magnitude at ffr is smaller than that at peak ⅰ and peak ⅱ the other small peaks that have not been labeled in the spectrum result from the frequency spectrum leakage or blade periodic vortex shedding frequency the frequency spectrum leakage is caused by the fact that the sampling frequency and original signal frequency are out of sync the original signal frequency of the turbine loads is an infinite decimal thus a truncation error would appear when we choose the sampling frequency during the fft analysis the periodic vortex shedding of the turbine blade will also cause vibrations in the turbine loads thus leaving peaks at the turbine load spectrum the small peaks caused by the spectrum leakage or vortex shedding will not be discussed in the following analysis in the following spectra for the turbine under different surge frequencies and surge amplitudes a similar phenomenon could be observed in those spectra the following analysis will concentrate on explaining the influence of several special frequencies on the dynamics of the turbine fig 24 shows one single turbine power output spectrum of the twin rotor turbine at three different tsrs the four highest peaks are annotated in fig 24 i e peak ⅰ peak ⅱ 1 5 peak ⅱ 2 0 and peak ⅱ 2 5 detailed parameters of those peaks are documented in table 9 the frequency of peak ⅰ is equal to ffo the frequencies of peak ⅱ at different tsrs are all 3 times that of the ffr with the increase in tsr the magnitude at peak ⅰ gradually increases and the magnitude at peak ⅰ is larger than that at peak ⅱ when tsr is larger than 1 5 thus the surge motion frequency has a larger influence on the power output efficiency than the rotation frequency when the turbine is at a high tsr the magnitude at peak ⅱ gradually decreases with increasing tsr but the response difference is less than 5 the influence of tsr change on peak ⅱ is not obvious however the frequency of peak ⅱ gradually increase with the increase of tsr as discussed above the highest peak for the turbine load occurs at 2ffr and 4ffr while one of the highest peaks for the turbine power output occurs at 3ffr according to payne et al 2018 a similar phenomenon could be found in which multiple specific peaks can be observed in the turbine load and torque spectrum the highest peak also takes place at three times the rotational frequency in the spectrum they explained that it is due to the shadowing effect of the tower taking place when each blade passes the tower i e three times per revolution for the twin rotor turbine although there is no solid tower in the computational domain the three blades of each rotor will meet each other once in the middle the mutual interaction caused by the rotor blade passing acts like an invisible tower shadowing effect in the computational domain as seen in the flow field in figs 12 b fig 33 and fig 42 the flow field in the middle channel is not symmetrical therefore an invisible tower shadowing effect should occur when each blade of the two rotors passes by in the middle channel i e three times per revolution in the following power output spectrum the same characteristics could be observed peaks a b and c occur at 0 71 hz 0 88 hz and 1 05 hz respectively and there are not multiple relationships between those frequencies and the fundamental frequency of rotation or surge motion which is caused by the frequency spectrum leakage for the turbine load spectrum the highest peaks found in the turbine load spectra occur at 2ffr and 4ffr the thrust and lateral force of the twin rotor used in the spectrum analysis is a simple sum of the time history load of each rotor this phenomenon could not be explained by any obvious hydrodynamic phenomenon at the moment compared with the spectra between the turbine load and power output it can only be concluded that the frequency characteristics for the turbine load are caused by the complex interactions between the two rotors further experimental investigations are needed to analyze this phenomenon 4 3 influence of the surge amplitude several surge amplitudes ζ 0 are selected in the simulation namely 0 4 m 0 05 d 0 8 m 0 1d 1 0 m 0 125 d 1 2 m 0 15 d and 1 6 m 0 2 d the incoming flow velocity is 3 m s the tsr is 2 0 the oscillation frequency ω is 1 rad s the oscillation rule can be expressed by ξ ξ 0 sin ω t the parameter setups at different surge amplitudes are shown in table 10 fig 25 and fig 26 show the time varying curves of the thrust and lateral force coefficients at different surge amplitudes compared with the twin rotor system in the uniform flow without oscillation motion the load variation tendency of the twin rotor system in the oscillation motion is more complex more load crests and troughs could be seen when the turbine was in the surge motion compared with the time histories of turbine power outputs in figs 13 and 14 the phase relationship between the thrust and lateral forces of the turbine is dramatically changed by the surge motion furthermore the periodicity of the turbine load time history shares the same characteristics when the surge amplitude increases from 0 8 m to 1 6 m the load crests and troughs that the fluctuation amplitude of the turbine load increases with the surge amplitude and that the phase relationship at different surge amplitudes remains the same at different surge amplitudes the fluctuation amplitude and average value change tendency of the thrust coefficient lateral force coefficient at different surge amplitudes are shown in figs 27 and 28 respectively the thrust and lateral force coefficients increase with the surge amplitude the mean values of the thrust and lateral force coefficients change very little at different surge amplitudes as mentioned above the turbine is assumed to move harmonically in the flow therefore the incoming flow velocity for the turbine will increase and change periodically in terms of oscillation motion which increases the fluctuation of the turbine load however the velocity change in a period would be 0 therefore the oscillation motion would have no influence on the average load fig 29 and fig 30 show the spectra of the thrust and lateral force coefficients at different surge amplitudes a value of 0 m means that the turbine is fixed the influence of surge motion on the turbine load characteristics can be clearly seen in the spectrum the highest peak peak ⅰ could be observed in the turbine load spectrum when the turbine was fixed peak ⅰ occurs at 2ffr the two highest peaks peak ⅰ and peak ⅱ could be observed in the turbine load spectrum when the turbine began to oscillate peak ⅰ and peak ⅱ occur at 2ffr and 4ffr respectively therefore it is obvious that the turbine generates the highest response magnitude at peak ⅱ resulting from the turbine surge motion furthermore it should be noted that the magnitude at peak ⅱ is higher than that at peak ⅰ when the turbine begins to oscillate which reveals that the turbine will generate a high frequency response for the turbine load when the turbine is in surge motion peaks a and b occur at 1 68ffr and 3ffr respectively peak a is caused by the frequency leakage peak b is caused by the blade passing frequency detailed parameters of those peaks are documented in table 11 when the surge amplitude increases the magnitude at peak ⅰ and peak ⅱ increases and the frequency remains the same therefore the increase in surge amplitude has no influence on the fluctuation frequency and only increases the turbine load fluctuation amplitude which agrees with the time history of the turbine load at different surge amplitudes as shown in figs 25 and 26 fig 31 shows the power output of the average power output efficiency of the turbine with respect to different surge amplitudes a value of 0 m indicates that the twin rotor system does not oscillate the power output changes little with increasing surge amplitude the surge motion only results in a periodic variation in the current velocity at the rotor disk surface the average velocity change for the turbine disk would be 0 in a given period and the average power output changes little fig 32 shows the single turbine power output spectrum of the twin rotor turbine at different surge amplitudes the detailed parameters of fig 33 are documented in table 12 when the turbine is fixed only peak ⅰ with a frequency of 0 716 hz could be observed the frequency of peak ⅰ is 3 times that of the rotation frequency when the surge amplitude increases the frequency of peak ⅰ remains the same the two highest peaks peak ⅰ and peak ⅱ could be observed when the turbine is in the surge motion compared with the turbine without the surge motion the magnitude of peak ⅰ will decrease when the turbine is in the surge motion while the magnitude at peak ⅱ will increase the frequency of peak ⅰ is equal to the oscillation frequency and the response of peak ⅱ is much larger than that of peak ⅰ therefore the oscillation frequency is the dominant factor for the power output fluctuation the flow field variation characteristics are also studied fig 33 shows the flow field when the turbine is at the equivalent position the rotation of the twin turbine results in jet flow in the middle of the twin turbine the jet flow breaks the continuous vortex into a concentrated vortex compared with the two outer vortex streets the continuity of the vortex street in the middle is worse and the vortex street is more discrete when the surge amplitude increases the instant velocity of the turbine at the equivalent position will increase from 0 8 m s to 1 6 m s thus the outer vortex street in the near flow field is breaking with the increase of surge amplitude pointed out by four boxes even though the surge amplitude increases from 0 8 m to 1 6 m three concentrated vortices could still be observed in the wake flow without any change pointed out by three arrows increasing the surge amplitude will not change the vortex shedding frequency 4 4 influence of the surge frequency it is assumed that the surge frequency of the turbine is identical to that of the wave frequency therefore the common wave frequencies are selected in the simulation namely 0 4 rad s 0 8 rad s 1 rad s 1 2 rad s and 1 6 rad s the incoming flow velocity is 3 m s the tsr is 2 0 the oscillation amplitude is 1 0 m the parameter setup at different surge frequencies is shown in table 13 fig 34 and fig 35 show the time varying curves of the thrust and lateral force coefficients at different surge frequencies the period characteristics of the thrust and lateral force coefficients change little with increasing surge frequency the overall cyclic variation tendencies of the thrust and lateral force coefficients at different surge frequencies are nearly the same except for some slight amplitude differences the peak value of the thrust and lateral force coefficient increases with surge frequency comparing the load time history of the turbine in surge motion with the turbine without surge motion the oscillation motion dramatically changes the time history curve of the turbine thrust and lateral force fig 36 and fig 37 show the spectrum thrust and lateral force of the twin rotor turbine at different surge frequencies a value of 0 rad s means that the turbine is fixed the detailed parameters in figs 36 and 37 are documented in table 14 the two highest peaks peaks ⅰ and ⅱ with frequencies of 0 477 hz and 0 951 hz respectively could be observed when the turbine was at different surge frequencies the frequency of peak ⅰ occurs at 2 times the rotation frequency the frequency of peak ⅱ occurs at 4 times the rotation frequency peak a occurs at 3ffr with an increasing surge frequency the response at peak ⅱ gradually increases however the frequency of peak ⅱ did not change with the surge frequency in figs 34 and 35 the time history fluctuation tendencies of the thrust and lateral forces at different surge frequencies remain the same and the surge frequency only changes the fluctuation amplitude the fluctuation amplitude and average value of the thrust and lateral force coefficients at different surge frequencies are shown in fig 38 and fig 39 the surge frequency has little effect on the average value of the thrust and lateral force coefficients the fluctuation amplitude of the thrust and lateral force coefficients increase with the surge frequency for the same reason different surge frequencies increase the incoming flow velocity fluctuation range but the velocity change in a period would be 0 fig 40 shows the power output of the twin turbine at different surge frequencies as we can see the surge frequency has little effect on the average output of the twin turbine the small fluctuation in the average power output occurs because the velocity change on the turbine disk is periodic the mean velocity change within the turbine disk in a surge motion period is 0 fig 41 shows the single turbine power output spectrum of the twin rotor turbine at three different surge frequencies detailed parameters for the power output spectrum are documented in table 15 peak ⅰ was always be observed for the twin rotor turbine the frequency of peak ⅰ occurs at 3 times the ffr the magnitude at peak ⅰ decreased when the turbine began to oscillate with increasing surge frequency the response at peak ⅰ gradually increases when the turbine was in the surge motion two peaks were observed for the two surge frequencies the frequency of peak ⅱ was 0 127 hz and the frequency was equal to the corresponding ffo when the surge frequency was 0 8 rad s the frequency of peak ⅱ was 0 252 hz and the frequency was also equal to the corresponding ffo when the surge frequency was 1 6 rad s the response at peak ⅱ was larger than that at peak ⅰ when the turbine was at different surge frequencies the oscillation frequency is the dominant factor for the power output fluctuation frequency when the turbine oscillates fig 42 shows the wake flow characteristics of the twin turbine at different surge frequencies the surge frequency influences the vortex shedding frequency the vortex shedding frequency increases with increasing surge frequency and the distribution of the vortex is more dispersed in the wake flow three vortices were observed in the wake flow of the turbine when the oscillation frequency was 0 8 rad s while 5 vortices were observed when the surge frequency increased to 1 6 rad s however the variation in surge frequency has very little effect on the length of wake flow therefore the surge frequency has a greater effect on the frequency of vortex shedding while the surge amplitude has little effect on the vortex shedding frequency 5 discussion in section 4 the influences of the tsr surge amplitude and surge frequency on the turbine load power output efficiency and wake flow characteristics are presented these influences are discussed in terms of several different aspects as shown in figs 22 23 29 30 36 and 37 the two highest peaks could be observed in the turbine load spectrum detailed relationships between those two peaks and the fundamental frequency ffr and ffo are documented in table 16 in figs 22 and 23 the turbine has a high frequency response with increasing tsr in figs 29 and 30 36 and 37 increasing the surge amplitude and surge frequency does not change the peak frequency in the spectrum and only the magnitudes at those peaks increase two peaks have been annotated in those figures peak ⅰ and peak ⅱ the frequencies of peak ⅰ and peak ⅱ are 2 and 4 times the rotation frequency respectively there is no integer multiple relationship between the frequencies of peak ⅰ and peak ⅱ and the surge frequency however this result does not mean that the surge frequency has no influence on the turbine load characteristics in figs 29 and 30 34 37 when the turbine is fixed peaks occur at ffr 2ffr and 3ffr when the turbine starts oscillating peaks occur at ffr 2ffr 3ffr and 4ffr at different surge amplitudes and surge frequencies and the magnitude at 4ffr is the highest therefore the turbine generates a high frequency response when the turbine starts oscillating notably the peaks in the turbine load occur at ffr 2ffr 3ffr and 4ffr but the turbine load has the highest magnitude at 2ffr and 4ffr the multiple relationships between the frequencies of the peaks and the fundamental frequency for the turbine power output are shown in table 17 the responses at peak ⅰ and peak ⅱ are also provided the frequency of peak ⅰ is always three times ffr the multiple frequencies are related to the turbine blade passing frequency each rotor of the twin rotor turbine has 3 identical blades there would be 3 blades passing the same location in a rotation period similar results could also be found in zhao s study zhao et al 2016 and the results showed that there was a complex multiple frequency vibration for a three blade vertical axis turbine the fundamental frequency of torsional vibration was three times that of the rotation frequency in this research since the power output of the turbine is computed by equation 9 during the simulation the torque dynamic characteristics should be the same as the power output characteristics the power output spectrum in different cases shows that the turbine always has the second highest magnitude at 3ffr the frequency of peak ⅱ is equal to ffo in all cases table 17 shows that the magnitude at peak ⅱ is always lower than that at peak ⅰ when the turbine is in the surge motion therefore the surge frequency plays a more important role in the power output characteristics of the turbine increasing the surge amplitude will not change the frequency of peak ⅰ in the power output spectrum but it will increase the magnitude at peak ⅰ the turbine power output will generate a high frequency response with increasing surge frequency and the magnitude at the corresponding ffo will also increase 6 conclusion in this study a new concept of the π type twin rotor tidal current turbines is proposed the rotation and oscillation motions of the twin rotors are combined based on the moving mesh and dynamic mesh techniques the hydrodynamics turbine load characteristics power output characteristics and wake flow characteristics of the twin turbine system are studied in this paper the load coefficient flow field variation and rotor dynamic characteristics are analyzed the conclusions are described as follows 1 the twin rotor turbine system could increase the power output compared with a single turbine the average power output of the twin rotor turbine could increase by as much as 15 3 the mutual interactions between the two rotors tend to increase the power output at a high tsr 2 the surge amplitude and surge frequency would increase the turbine load and power output fluctuation but it will not change the average values of the turbine load and power output the fluctuation amplitude of the lateral force and thrust coefficient is proportional to the surge amplitude and surge frequency 3 the turbine load would have the highest magnitudes at 2ffr and 4 ffr increasing the surge amplitude and surge frequency would increase the magnitudes at those peaks in the spectrum but would not change the frequency of those peaks 4 the turbine power output spectrum shows that the turbine has the highest magnitudes at ffo and 3ffr the surge frequency plays a more important role in the power output characteristics of the turbine increasing the surge amplitude will not change the frequency of peak ⅰ in the power output spectrum but it will increase the magnitude at peak ⅰ the turbine power output will generate a high frequency response with increasing surge frequency and the magnitude at the corresponding ffo will also increase 5 the surge motion of the turbine will break the concentrated vortices into smaller vortices the surge amplitude has no effect on the vortex shedding frequency while the surge frequency increases the vortex shedding frequency causing larger blade load fluctuations credit authorship contribution

20967,for a floating tidal current turbine power station the motion response of the floating carrier would affect the hydrodynamic performance of the tidal current turbine to study the turbine loads and power output characteristics of the proposed twin rotor turbine in moving condition the hydrodynamic performance of a vertical axis twin rotor turbine in surge motion is thoroughly discussed in this manuscript based on the moving mesh and sliding mesh technique the rotary motion and surge motion of the turbine are combined to simulate the turbine operation conditions in waves and currents the twin rotor turbine working at different surge frequencies surge amplitudes and tip speed ratios is simulated and the simulation results are compared with the fixed turbine in an uniform flow the change characteristics of thrust force lateral force and flow field are analyzed the results show that the twin rotor can improve the power output efficiency better than a stand alone turbine surge frequency and surge amplitude have very little influence on the average power output of the turbine the fluctuation amplitude of the thrust and lateral forces of a twin rotor turbine is larger than the stand alone turbine while the fluctuation amplitude of thrust and lateral forces increase with surge amplitude and frequency spectra of turbine loads and power output show that surge and rotation frequencies have different impacts on the dynamics and performances of the turbine the research results can provide a reference for the development of floating tidal current power stations in the future keywords tidal current energy vertical axis twin rotor turbine hydrodynamic performance forced oscillation 1 introduction tidal current energy represents a significant kind of marine renewable energy resource and has attracted attention from researchers worldwide due to its predictability sustainability widespread distribution and high energy density zhang and li 2016 tidal current turbines are one of the most important devices for capturing tidal current energy tidal current turbines can convert the kinetic energy of tides and currents into mechanical energy and use the generator to produce electricity ma et al 2016 according to the main shaft structure of the tidal current turbine tidal current turbines can be divided into horizontal axis tidal turbines hatts and vertical axis tidal turbines vatts a vatt represents a vital kind of tidal current turbine and has the advantages of a simple design compact gear transmission design low seal requirement and low noise li et al 2011 wang et al 2004 compared with the slow development of vertical axis wind turbines in the wind energy industry vatts are obtaining new opportunities in marine renewable energy development to date hatts account for 43 of the prototypes in industry demonstrations while vatts account for 33 uihlein and magagna 2016 some researchers have suggested that twin rotor tidal current turbines could be a better format for capturing tidal current energy among various kinds of vatts since the average power outputs of twin rotor tidal current turbines is larger than those of stand alone turbines ma et al 2018 several precommercial prototypes in fig 1 of twin rotor tidal current turbines have been reported in the literature or in the demonstration phase such as the marine current turbine mct stanford narrows northern ireland a douglas et al 2008 floating kuroshio turbine fkt japan chiu et al 2016 ak1000 orkney scotland zhang et al 2015 hai neng ⅰ zhejiang china zhang et al 2016 hai neng ⅱ horizontal axis twin rotor turbine qingdao china guo 2013 and hai neng ⅲ vertical axis twin rotor turbine dai shan china jing 2013 in fig 1 a b are fixed type twin rotor tidal current turbines while c f are floating type twin rotor tidal current turbines the platforms carrying the twin rotor tidal current turbine can be classified as ⅰ floating mooring platforms ⅱ pile mounted platforms and ⅲ sea bed mounted or gravity based platforms compared with the other two types of platforms the floating mooring platform has the advantages of ⅰ the floating moored systems are easy to install maintain and remove ⅱ the floating mooring platform has simpler maintenance schedules and ⅲ the floating mooring platform is preferred at locations where the sea bed is mostly stone with deeper sea conditions since the current speed decreases with increasing sea depth the floating turbine can easily capture the kinetic energy of sea surface currents the pile mounted system is practical for deep water conditions 30 60 m and the structure is very rigid the sea bed mounted platform and gravity based platform are best for shallow water where the effects from waves and wind are minimal zhang et al 2013 several pilot floating twin rotor tidal current turbines located worldwide are listed in table 1 most of these turbines are still in the demonstration phase and are still far from business applications the floating catamaran is a promising carrier among various kinds of floating mooring platforms floating catamarans have the advantages of a large deck area convenient maintenance and deployment and strong adaptability to water depth and complex sea bed topography fig 1 shows the tidal current power station hai neng ⅰ which was developed by harbin engineering university and

submarine cable the successful operation of hai neng ⅰ lays the foundation of hai neng ⅱ and hai neng ⅲ the rated power outputs of hai neng ⅱ and hai neng ⅲ are 2 100 kw and 2 300 kw respectively until now the existing literature on twin rotor tidal current turbines under moving conditions has been very limited investigations of twin rotor tidal current turbines have mostly been conducted under fixed conditions li and sander proposed a vortex method based on the traditional discrete vortex method dvm to study such a system li and calışal 2010 li and calisal 2011 the influence of the relative rotation direction corotating or counterrotating and relative distance between the twin rotors on the hydrodynamic performance was investigated the results showed that the relative efficiency of a twin rotor tidal current turbine could be 25 higher than that of a stand alone turbine the counterrotating direction could achieve higher power output efficiency compared with the other rotation directions in our published paper we conducted research on the hydrodynamic interactions between the two rotors ma et al 2018 the power output efficiency of the twin rotor tidal current turbine decreased when the relative distance exceeded a critical value the wake behind each rotor had the tendency to merge when the two rotors were too close to each other this closeness would result in a blockage effect for the incoming flow which led to a decrease in the power output for the twin rotor tidal current turbine stefania conducted a two dimensional cfd computational fluid dynamics analysis of the hydrodynamic interactions among three closely spaced vatts with a side by side layout and a triangular layout zanforlin 2018 the results showed that the side by side layout could increase the average power output efficiency in a wide range of incoming flow directions compared with the triangular layout however those studies did not consider the influence of floating platform motion on the hydrodynamics of the turbine in the presence of waves and currents researchers have studied the hydrodynamic performance changes of fixed stand alone turbines in the presence of waves and currents barltrop et al combined linear wave theory with blade element theory and established a mathematical model to solve the dynamic problems associated with marine current turbines barltrop et al 2007 the simulation results agreed well with the experimental results and the mathematical model could analyze the wave current interactions for marine current turbines in 2012 milne et al carried out a towing tank test to simulate the unsteady hydrodynamic loads of turbine blades subjected to waves and turbulence milne et al 2013 phenomena associated with dynamic stalling were observed the blade load could be 25 larger than that of the turbine in a steady uniform flow in 2013 ethan et al carried out a towing tank test to study the influence of surface waves on the performance of a scaled marine current turbine lust et al 2013 the experimental results were consistent with the computational results of bem blade element momentum theory the influences of different immersion depths and wave parameters on the hydrodynamics of the turbine were monitored during the experiment the presence of waves had very little influence on the average thrust and power output however the thrust and power output reached a maximum with the passing of the wave crest and a minimum with the passing of the wave trough they concluded that a significant change in power output might lead to poor electrical power quality and a significant change in thrust might increase the risk of fatigue failure yan et al established a computational free surface flow framework to study the hydrodynamic performance of horizontal axis tidal stream turbines subjected to free surface flow yan et al 2017 the thrust and power coefficients exhibited time periodic behavior which was consistent with the wave frequency the average thrust and power coefficients decreased as the immersion depth declined however the above results were all obtained under the assumption that the turbine is fixed in waves and currents for a twin rotor tidal current turbine mounted on a catamaran the catamaran may generate periodic motion in the presence of waves and currents thus the flow field around the turbine also changes due to motion the dynamic load behavior of the twin rotor tidal current turbine would be very different from the fixed situation x guo et al 2018 the periodic motions have a negative influence on the hydrodynamics and fatigue life of the twin rotor tidal current turbine guo et al 2018 brown et al 2020 due to the lack of relative research results and literature existing stand alone turbines and twin rotor tidal current turbines often adopt conservative designs to reduce the risk of fatigue failure and structural damage holst et al 2015 however the motion response of twin rotor tidal current turbines in a real sea environment is very complicated in addition due to complex geometric shapes it is too complicated to directly study the hydrodynamic performances of most floating power stations when subjected to waves and currents therefore we make the following assumptions 1 the twin rotor tidal current turbine is fixed to the catamaran though the main shaft and the main shaft is fixed on the catamaran 2 the whole system moves harmonically 3 the immersion depth of the twin rotor tidal current turbine is deep enough so that the waves have no influence on the incoming current speed of the turbine in this paper the hydrodynamic simulation of the twin rotor turbine in surge motion induced by the floating platform is carried out in ansys cfx ansysinc 2010 the rotary motion and surge motion of the turbine are combined to simulate the turbine s moving condition in the presence of waves and currents based on the moving mesh and sliding mesh techniques the cfd method can reflect the influence of the turbulent flow and viscosity of water on the hydrodynamic performances of tidal turbines harrison et al 2010 the results of the cfd method are more accurate than those of the potential flow theory and researchers can know more details regarding the wake flow which could benefit the understanding and research of the hydrodynamic mechanism for turbines a sliding mesh and moving mesh are adopted in the numerical simulations the influence of the tip speed ratio tsr surge frequency and surge amplitude on the hydrodynamic performance of the twin rotor tidal current turbine is investigated due to the complexity of the 6 degree of freedom motion simulation only surge motion induced by platform motion is considered in this study 2 twin rotor turbine and cfd modeling 2 1 introduction to the π type vertical axis twin rotor tidal current turbine a π type vertical axis twin rotor tidal current turbine which is carried by a catamaran is introduced in this study fig 2 the layout plan of the twin rotor system is similar to the greek letter π and the incoming flow direction is assumed to be perpendicular to the middle line between the two rotors the overall configuration of the twin rotor system is a π type structure consisting of two vertical axis tidal current turbines the two rotors rotate in the opposite direction the twin rotor tidal current turbine adopts a modular design including a main supporting frame turbine blade hub spider waterproof disc main shaft and electric power control system the main supporting frame is used to support the twin rotor tidal current turbine and the relative distance between the two rotors can be adjusted the air foil of the blade is naca0018 the diameter of the turbine can be adjusted by the tapping hole set on the supporting arm three supporting arms are connected by a three slipper pretensioner to enhance structural stability the twin rotor tidal current turbine has the following advantages the simple structure of the turbine is less expensive for manufacturing the twin rotor tidal current turbine can operate at wide ranges of water depths and has a stronger ability to adapt to the complex sea environment the hub spiders holding the blades are above the water level which can reduce flow field disturbance the cantilever straight blade has no other additional components below the water level thus causing less influence on the flow field which benefits the energy capture of the turbine in addition the cantilever straight blade reduces the risk of water plant and fish net entanglement the cantilever blade design is convenient for installation maintenance marine foul cleaning operations and other offshore operations long term operation costs for such a system are low since all the components of the π type twin rotor tidal current turbine are above the water level except for the blades the waterproofing difficulty is highly reduced the seawater corrosion effect on the twin rotor tidal current turbine has been highly reduced which promotes the reliability of such a system 2 2 turbine load analysis as shown in fig 3 the blade load parallel to the flow direction is defined as thrust while the blade load vertical to the flow direction is defined as the lateral force thrust f x and lateral force f y of the turbine are defined by 1 where d r is the drag force of a single blade chordwise l is the lifting force chordwise α is the attack angle θ is the position angle of the blade and ϕ is the pitch angle of the blade the torque q of a single blade to the rotation center

coordinate values of the blade foil center the above derivation results are the load of a single blade for a turbine the total load acting on the turbine could be obtained by adding all the turbine blades together 4 f x θ f x 1 θ f x 2 θ f x z θ i 1 z f x 1 θ z 1 2 π z f y θ f y 1 θ f y 2 θ f y z θ i 1 z f y 1 θ z 1 2 π z q θ q 1 θ q 2 θ q z θ i 1 z q 1 θ z 1 2 π z where z is the number of

setup of the twin rotor turbine the three dimensional flow around the turbine is assumed to be incompressible and unsteady in absolute rectangular coordinates the basic governing equations to describe the transient flow can be expressed as follows continuity equation 10 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 navier stokes equation momentum equation 11 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j s i where ρ is the water density u is the velocity p is the pressure t is the time x is the spatial coordinate μ is the kinetic viscosity and s is the source term despite the fact that equation 11 can be used to describe the turbulence flow it is difficult to directly solve equation 11 due to the high pulsation characteristics of the turbulence nonlinear characteristic of the n s equation and diversity of the turbine boundary condition wang 2005 thus the time average method is often used by researchers to simplify turbulence fluctuations the rans reynolds average navier stokes equation originated from the time average method the rans equations were used to model the turbulent flow because they are relatively simple and more computationally economical than other approaches such as direct numerical simulation dns and large eddy simulation les moreover the rans results are widely accepted in the published literature for predicting the hydrodynamic loads of turbines turnock et al 2011 afgan et al 2013 batten

equation is not closed to solve the flow field around the turbine a corresponding turbulence model should be adopted some turbulence models are widely used in solving the flow field i e k ε k ω sst shear stress turbulence reynolds stress model les and dns in 1994 the sst model was developed by menter 1994 for the numerical simulation of tidal current turbines the sst turbulence model is frequently adopted by many researchers afgan et al 2013 liu et al 2016 shives and crawford 2016 the sst model combines the advantages of k ε and k ω the k ω model is adopted in the inner region of the boundary layer and switches to the standard k ε model in the outer region and free shear flows the sst model shows a good performance in the simulation of the flow separation and flow domain with a reverse pressure gradient catalano pointed out that the k ω sst model could better simulate the stalling characteristics of the airfoil and cost less computational time catalano and tognaccini 2010 the sst turbulent model is adopted in the simulation the sst shows advantages in capturing complex boundary layer flows under adverse pressure gradients or simulating flow separation many researchers have adopted the sst model to simulate vatt the sst model has been proven to be accurate by many researchers in simulating rotation fluid machinery afgan et al 2013 masters et al 2015 shives and crawford 2016 liu et al 2016 ahmed et al 2017 the computational domain of the twin rotor tidal current turbine simulation with surge motion is shown in fig 4 and fig 6 the incoming flow is parallel to the x axis the whole computational domain is divided into the steady domain the rotation domain and the surging domain the three domains are connected by an interface the motion of the rotation domain and the surging domain are sinusoidal and only the surge motion is applied to the twin rotor turbine the rotation domain rotates inside the surging domain and the rotation domain acts as the subdomain of the surging domain the surging domain and steady domain are connected by an interface this kind of setup can reduce the mesh deformation and guarantee the calculation accuracy table 2 shows the boundary conditions and wall functions used for the numerical simulation the surging law can be expressed by ξ ξ 0 sin ω t ξ 0 is the surge amplitude and ω is the surge frequency the surge motion of the turbine is realized by the dynamic mesh technique the rotation of the rotor is controlled by cel cfx expression language the dynamic mesh and sliding mesh techniques are used to control the motion of the mesh a structured mesh is adopted in the computational simulation compared with the unstructured mesh the structured mesh shows more advantages in terms of convergence speed and accuracy in the numerical simulation mcnaughton et al 2014 different grid topologies are used in the computational domain the rotation domain adopts the o grid method fig 5 and fig 6 while the static domain adopts the h grid and o grid method this strategy allowed for a smooth transition of the mesh geometry from the circular disk regions to the rectangular tunnel cross section thus circumventing the increase in grid nonorthogonality or skewness of the grid cells in the cfx setup the convergence criterion is set to a root mean square rms of less than 1 0 10 4 in the transient simulation of the twin rotor turbine the transient solver is set to be at least two iterations within each time step while the maximum number of iterations should be less than 10 within each time step the high resolution second order backward euler scheme is adopted to discretize the transient term ensuring implicit time discretization a larger mesh density has a positive effect in terms of improving the numerical simulation accuracy however the numerical simulation needs to maintain a balance between the simulation accuracy and time consumption the most important part of the hydrodynamic performance analysis for the vatt is the flow field simulation around the turbine blade research results regarding the mesh thickness around the turbine blade can be seen in many studies lanzafame et al 2014 it is effective to simulate the flow field around the turbine blade when y 5 a mesh refinement near the walls of the turbine blades was set to fully capture the interactions between the fluid and the turbine blades as presented in fig 5 the surface of the blade is set as a no slip wall and the blade surface is influenced by the fluid friction force the outer sidewall adopts a free slip wall and the wall is not influenced by the fluid friction force 2 4 effectiveness verification to verify the effectiveness of the two dimensional simulation the numerical simulation results are compared with the circulation water tunnel experiment results turbine and test apparatus the turbine used in this experiment was a three bladed vertical axis turbine measuring 0 8 m in diameter the chord length of the blade was 0 12 m the air foil of the turbine blade was naca0018 detailed parameters of the turbine are shown in table 3 the blades were mounted on a tapered beam and the tapered beam was connected to a nacelle fig 7 and fig 8 the nacelle was connected to a flange plate the flange plate was connected to the main shaft of the turbine there were two encoders namely the absolute encoder and incremental encoder mounted on the main shaft to monitor the phase angle and instantaneous angular velocity of the turbine the torque of the turbine was transmitted to the horizontally mounted generator according to the bevel gear and the horizontal shaft a speed torque meter was mounted in the middle of the horizontal shaft to measure the speed and torque of the turbine circulation water tunnel the experiment of the vertical axis cantilever turbine was carried out in the circulation water tunnel at harbin engineering university which measures 17 3 m long 6 2 m wide and 2 8 m deep the tunnel features a horizontal circulation pump that can produce uniform water flow at a velocity range of 0 2 5 m s the circulation water tunnel is also equipped with a wave absorber capable of making the stationary wave height smaller than 7 mm when the water velocity is below 1 5 m s a two dimensional numerical simulation method is adopted to compute the hydrodynamics of the twin rotor tidal current turbine for this specific turbine in this study there are no extra connecting arms or main shaft below the water surface which lays a good foundation for the two dimensional numerical simulation of the proposed turbine a three dimensional model is required for some special purposes such as calculating the vertical flow fluctuation i e the flow fluctuation in the z direction studying the arm effects etc for turbine designers in the initial design stage because the computational time of the three dimensional model is more than thirty times that of the two dimensional model it can be said that the two dimensional model is more cost effective than the three dimensional model however due to the inherent defects of the two dimensional numerical simulations of vatts e g infinite span length of the blade and infinite water depth mannion et al 2018 the flow divergence is constrained over the top and bottom of the vertical axis tidal turbine lam and peng 2016 thus two dimensional numerical simulation tends to overestimate the power output of the vertical axis turbine by using fully turbulent rans models lanzafame et al 213 yang and lawn 2013 previous published literature has discussed the influence of the span ratio and arm installation location on the hydrodynamic performance of vatts the power output reduction coefficient for different arm locations and different span ratios was provided in li and calisal 2010 marsh et al 2015 2017 to verify the feasibility of the 2d numerical simulation for the vertical axis turbine the turbine power output efficiency and blade loads are compared between the experimental and computational results as fig 9 shows the power output efficiencies of the two dimensional numerical simulation results are larger than those of the experimental results to eliminate the overestimation of turbine power by 2d numerical simulation a reduction coefficient should be applied to correct the power output efficiency then due to the unique structure of the turbine blade there is no connecting arm or main shaft below the water surface only a correction considering the span ratio effect is applied the ratio of turbine height and radius h r for this turbine is 2 125 li s work li and calisal 2010 documented that the power output efficiency can decrease by as much as 6 5 when the h r of the vatt is 2 125 thus the power output reduction factor for this specific turbine would be 0 935 therefore the power output efficiency results for cfx are multiplied by the reduction factor and then the correction curve is obtained the correction curve reaches the maximum power output at approximately 2 3 the cyclic variation tendency of the correction curve agreed well with the experimental results the deviation between the correction curve and experimental curve is below 4 when the three dimensional effect is considered the difference between the exp curve and correction curve is acceptable to further verify the feasibility of the two dimensional numerical simulations the blade load computational results obtained by cfx are compared with the experimental results from strickland the specific turbine parameters in the strickland experiment are documented in table 4 the overall variation trends of the computational results agree well with the experimental results over a given period except when the angle ranges from 180 360 in fig 10 the tangential force is generally an order of magnitude smaller than the normal force and is thus much more subject to experimental error and extraneous noise since the two dimensional numerical simulations ignored the three dimensional effect and blade vortex shedding effect over the top and bottom of the turbine blade the overall cyclic variation tendency is well correlated for the experiment and numerical simulation therefore the two dimensional numerical simulation method can be applied to simulate the turbine loads and power output efficiency notably the introduction of the reduction factor verifies the effectiveness and feasibility of the two dimensional numerical simulation for the vertical axis twin rotor tidal current turbine no such correction is applied to the following numerical simulations the accurate prediction of turbine power output is not the main focus of this manuscript and the overestimation of the power output of the turbine will not influence the following study of the turbine the overestimation of the power output for the turbine will not change the fluctuation characteristics of the load and power output in the following numerical simulations nor will it change the frequency characteristics of the turbine load and power output 3 numerical simulation of a twin turbine system without oscillation the simulation of the hydrodynamic performance of the twin turbine system in a uniform flow is carried out in this section the relative distance between the two rotors is 12 m 1 5d as fig 11 shows the upper rotor rotates counterclockwise and the lower rotor rotates clockwise this kind of rotation can counteract the influence of the lateral force and increase the power output efficiency jang et al 2016 for the sake of decreasing the load fluctuation of the turbine the initial phase angles of the two rotors are both set as 0 the incoming flow v e is 3 m s the angular velocities of the upper and lower rotors are ω and ω respectively several tsrs have been selected in the simulation i e 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 and 4 0 c p 1 is the average power output coefficient of the lower rotor c p 2 is the average power output coefficient of the upper rotor c p is the average power output efficiency of the twin turbine system as shown in fig 12 a the average power output efficiency of the twin turbine is very close to that of the single turbine at a low tsr the power output efficiency of the twin rotor system is larger than that of the single turbine when the tip speed ratio is close to the optimal tsr when the tsr is equal to 2 0 the average power output coefficient of the twin rotor turbine is 15 3 higher than that of the single turbine the mutual interference between the twin rotors can indeed increase the power output efficiency which is consistent with the result in the existing literature dyachuk et al 2012 the power output efficiency increases for the twin rotor turbine at larger tsrs first when the turbine is operating at a low tsr the turbine generates flow separation and dynamic stalling the benefit of mutual interactions between the two rotors is not obvious second as seen in the velocity magnitude maps fig 12 b an increase in tsr leads to a reduction in the turbine permeability making the turbine increasingly similar to a bluff body as revealed by the wake shortening and the growth of wake instabilities far downstream compared with the contour of the stand alone turbine the high flow velocity area dramatically increased for the twin rotor turbine at high tsrs additionally the flow in the middle is accelerated when the tsr increases for the twin rotor turbine at a low tsr the high flow velocity area yellow spots tsr 1 5 in the middle is dispersed while the high flow velocity area at a high tsr is more concentrated and larger tan spots in the middle tsr 3 0 and being accelerated at the same time thus leading to the power output that increases at a high tsr similar results can also be found in zanforlin 2018 zanforlin and nishino 2016 fig 13 and fig 14 show the average dimensionless thrust coefficient and torque coefficient of the twin rotor turbine when the tip speed ratio is 2 0 the thrust and torque change periodically compared with stand alone turbines in an uniform flow multiple frequencies are seen in the time history of the twin rotor turbine loads the difference is caused by the mutual interactions between the two rotors an immediate effect of the narrow separation between the two rotors is that tip vortices shed from a rotor can impinge each other triggering unsteadiness for the turbine load in addition when the two rotors are deployed in close proximity the flow between the two rotors is accelerated due to the blockage effect which in turn increases the velocity fluctuation acting on the turbine blade clary et al 2020 nevertheless the fluctuation amplitude of the thrust is small and the upper envelope curve of the thrust is an approximately straight line the lateral force coefficient fluctuates more severely than the thrust the average value of the lateral force coefficient is equal to 0 0068 compared with a stand alone turbine system the motion response of a carrier carrying such a twin rotor system can be reduced 4 numerical simulation of the twin turbine system with oscillation 4 1 verification of the mesh size and time step the mesh size and time step independence tests are essential for the accuracy of numerical simulations fertahi et al 2018 satrio et al 2018 therefore the independent verifications of mesh size and time step should be carried out in the initial stage three different time steps and three different mesh cases are carried out to determine the optimal time step and mesh parameters all the verification cases employ the same surge motion parameters the surge amplitude is 1 m while the surge frequency is 1 rad s the mesh parameters are shown in table 5 the parameters of the time steps are shown in table 6 fig 15 and fig 16 show the time history of torque a single turbine for three different meshes and three different time steps respectively as shown in fig 15 the results of the medium mesh case nearly coincide with the fine mesh quality case moreover the fine mesh case requires 38 more time than the medium mesh case the coarse mesh case requires only the minimum time in the simulation however the torque of the coarse mesh quality case is quite different from that of the other two cases therefore the medium mesh quality has already met the mesh independent standard as shown in fig 16 case 1 nearly coincides with case 2 the computational time of case 1 is 52 longer than that of case 2 furthermore the torque of case 3 is obviously larger than that of the other two cases compared with case 2 case 3 saves only 26 of the computational time for the purpose of efficiency and accuracy the time step in case 2 is selected in the following simulations 4 2 influence of the tip speed ratio several different tsrs are selected during the simulation i e 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 and 3 5 the surge amplitude and surge frequency remain constant under different tsrs the surge motion parameters are shown in table 7 fig 17 shows the average power output coefficient of the twin turbine under two different scenarios i e turbine with surge motion turbine without surge motion compared with the twin rotor turbine without surge motion the varying tendencies of the power output of the two scenarios are nearly the same the oscillation of the twin rotor system has very little effect on the location of the optimal tsr the optimal tsr is always approximately 2 0 however the power output of the turbine with surge motion is slightly larger than that of the turbine without surge motion at high tsrs while the power output at low tsrs is nearly the same for a turbine with surge motion the incoming flow velocity acting on the turbine is the sum of the flow velocity v e and surge velocity ξ 0 ω cos ω t therefore the actual transient tsr of the turbine always changes when the turbine is in surge motion fig 18 and fig 19 show the power output time history of a single turbine at two different tsrs in a surge motion period the power output phase relationships of the turbine with surge motion and the turbine without surge motion are nearly the same but the magnitudes are quite different when the surge velocity is positive the turbine moves downstream when the value of the surge displacement is positive the turbine is downstream when the location surge displacement is 0 the turbine is at the equilibrium position when the turbine starts moving downstream there is a negative power output for both cases at this time the surge velocity acting on the blade is the largest and the surge velocity direction is opposite to the incoming flow direction which leads to a sharp decrease in power output when the surge velocity is close to 0 the power output curves of the turbine with surge motion and the turbine without surge motion are nearly coincident with each other when the turbine starts moving upstream the surge motion velocity increases the actual flow velocity acting on the blade which leads to an increase in the power output of the turbine with increasing tsr the fluctuation rate of the power output is more obvious and more wave crests and wave troughs can be seen in a surge motion period additionally the power output increase resulting from the negative surge velocity at a higher tsr is larger than that at a low tsr which may lead to a slight power output increase at a higher tsr for the turbine in surge motion to further investigate the thrust coefficient and lateral force coefficient are also analyzed μ 0 t μ d t t is defined as the average load of the turbine μ ˆ μ max μ min is defined as the fluctuation amplitude of the turbine load as shown in fig 20 and fig 21 the fluctuation amplitude of the thrust and lateral force coefficients of the twin rotor turbine are proportional to the tsr and both increase with the tsr the average lateral force coefficient does not change with the tsr since the lateral force directions for the two rotors are opposite the average lateral force of the twin rotor turbine slightly fluctuates at approximately 0 the fluctuation amplitude of the lateral force increases with the tsr obviously the frequency of the turbine load and power output efficiency of the twin rotor turbine with surge motion can be divided into two main components i e one component is related to the rotation frequency and the other component is related to the surge motion frequency however in the published literature it is not clearly discussed how the rotation frequency and oscillation frequency influence the turbine load and power output efficiency a spectrum analysis of turbine load can transform the complex time varying load curve into a clear frequency spectrum figure which makes it easier to analyze the frequency of turbine load components the fast fourier transform fft method is used to analyze the turbine load and power output characteristics in this study the frequency of turbine loads and power outputs are first investigated considering the spectral density of the thrust lateral force and power output efficiency defined by eqs 7 9 these spectra are plotted in the following figures for different tsrs surge frequencies and surge amplitudes those spectra are plotted against frequency the time series duration used to compute these spectral densities is 128 s for convenience ffr and ffo are defined as the fundamental frequencies of rotation and surge motion respectively the fundamental frequency of the twin rotor turbine ffr is the inverse of the rotation period the fundamental frequency of the oscillation ffo is the inverse of the surge motion period for the twin rotor turbine with forced sinusoidal motion the frequencies of the turbine load in the spectrum should be the integer multiple of the fundamental frequencies or the superposition of fundamental frequencies fig 22 and fig 23 show the spectra of the thrust and lateral forces for the twin rotor turbine at different tsrs multiple specific peaks are observed in the load and power output spectra for different tsrs for convenience these peaks have been labeled in the spectrum the two highest peaks found for different tsrs are peak ⅰ and peak ⅱ which take place at 2 and 4 times the ffr detailed parameters for the two peaks are shown in table 8 ffr is also labeled in the spectrum the response magnitude at ffr is smaller than that at peak ⅰ and peak ⅱ the other small peaks that have not been labeled in the spectrum result from the frequency spectrum leakage or blade periodic vortex shedding frequency the frequency spectrum leakage is caused by the fact that the sampling frequency and original signal frequency are out of sync the original signal frequency of the turbine loads is an infinite decimal thus a truncation error would appear when we choose the sampling frequency during the fft analysis the periodic vortex shedding of the turbine blade will also cause vibrations in the turbine loads thus leaving peaks at the turbine load spectrum the small peaks caused by the spectrum leakage or vortex shedding will not be discussed in the following analysis in the following spectra for the turbine under different surge frequencies and surge amplitudes a similar phenomenon could be observed in those spectra the following analysis will concentrate on explaining the influence of several special frequencies on the dynamics of the turbine fig 24 shows one single turbine power output spectrum of the twin rotor turbine at three different tsrs the four highest peaks are annotated in fig 24 i e peak ⅰ peak ⅱ 1 5 peak ⅱ 2 0 and peak ⅱ 2 5 detailed parameters of those peaks are documented in table 9 the frequency of peak ⅰ is equal to ffo the frequencies of peak ⅱ at different tsrs are all 3 times that of the ffr with the increase in tsr the magnitude at peak ⅰ gradually increases and the magnitude at peak ⅰ is larger than that at peak ⅱ when tsr is larger than 1 5 thus the surge motion frequency has a larger influence on the power output efficiency than the rotation frequency when the turbine is at a high tsr the magnitude at peak ⅱ gradually decreases with increasing tsr but the response difference is less than 5 the influence of tsr change on peak ⅱ is not obvious however the frequency of peak ⅱ gradually increase with the increase of tsr as discussed above the highest peak for the turbine load occurs at 2ffr and 4ffr while one of the highest peaks for the turbine power output occurs at 3ffr according to payne et al 2018 a similar phenomenon could be found in which multiple specific peaks can be observed in the turbine load and torque spectrum the highest peak also takes place at three times the rotational frequency in the spectrum they explained that it is due to the shadowing effect of the tower taking place when each blade passes the tower i e three times per revolution for the twin rotor turbine although there is no solid tower in the computational domain the three blades of each rotor will meet each other once in the middle the mutual interaction caused by the rotor blade passing acts like an invisible tower shadowing effect in the computational domain as seen in the flow field in figs 12 b fig 33 and fig 42 the flow field in the middle channel is not symmetrical therefore an invisible tower shadowing effect should occur when each blade of the two rotors passes by in the middle channel i e three times per revolution in the following power output spectrum the same characteristics could be observed peaks a b and c occur at 0 71 hz 0 88 hz and 1 05 hz respectively and there are not multiple relationships between those frequencies and the fundamental frequency of rotation or surge motion which is caused by the frequency spectrum leakage for the turbine load spectrum the highest peaks found in the turbine load spectra occur at 2ffr and 4ffr the thrust and lateral force of the twin rotor used in the spectrum analysis is a simple sum of the time history load of each rotor this phenomenon could not be explained by any obvious hydrodynamic phenomenon at the moment compared with the spectra between the turbine load and power output it can only be concluded that the frequency characteristics for the turbine load are caused by the complex interactions between the two rotors further experimental investigations are needed to analyze this phenomenon 4 3 influence of the surge amplitude several surge amplitudes ζ 0 are selected in the simulation namely 0 4 m 0 05 d 0 8 m 0 1d 1 0 m 0 125 d 1 2 m 0 15 d and 1 6 m 0 2 d the incoming flow velocity is 3 m s the tsr is 2 0 the oscillation frequency ω is 1 rad s the oscillation rule can be expressed by ξ ξ 0 sin ω t the parameter setups at different surge amplitudes are shown in table 10 fig 25 and fig 26 show the time varying curves of the thrust and lateral force coefficients at different surge amplitudes compared with the twin rotor system in the uniform flow without oscillation motion the load variation tendency of the twin rotor system in the oscillation motion is more complex more load crests and troughs could be seen when the turbine was in the surge motion compared with the time histories of turbine power outputs in figs 13 and 14 the phase relationship between the thrust and lateral forces of the turbine is dramatically changed by the surge motion furthermore the periodicity of the turbine load time history shares the same characteristics when the surge amplitude increases from 0 8 m to 1 6 m the load crests and troughs that the fluctuation amplitude of the turbine load increases with the surge amplitude and that the phase relationship at different surge amplitudes remains the same at different surge amplitudes the fluctuation amplitude and average value change tendency of the thrust coefficient lateral force coefficient at different surge amplitudes are shown in figs 27 and 28 respectively the thrust and lateral force coefficients increase with the surge amplitude the mean values of the thrust and lateral force coefficients change very little at different surge amplitudes as mentioned above the turbine is assumed to move harmonically in the flow therefore the incoming flow velocity for the turbine will increase and change periodically in terms of oscillation motion which increases the fluctuation of the turbine load however the velocity change in a period would be 0 therefore the oscillation motion would have no influence on the average load fig 29 and fig 30 show the spectra of the thrust and lateral force coefficients at different surge amplitudes a value of 0 m means that the turbine is fixed the influence of surge motion on the turbine load characteristics can be clearly seen in the spectrum the highest peak peak ⅰ could be observed in the turbine load spectrum when the turbine was fixed peak ⅰ occurs at 2ffr the two highest peaks peak ⅰ and peak ⅱ could be observed in the turbine load spectrum when the turbine began to oscillate peak ⅰ and peak ⅱ occur at 2ffr and 4ffr respectively therefore it is obvious that the turbine generates the highest response magnitude at peak ⅱ resulting from the turbine surge motion furthermore it should be noted that the magnitude at peak ⅱ is higher than that at peak ⅰ when the turbine begins to oscillate which reveals that the turbine will generate a high frequency response for the turbine load when the turbine is in surge motion peaks a and b occur at 1 68ffr and 3ffr respectively peak a is caused by the frequency leakage peak b is caused by the blade passing frequency detailed parameters of those peaks are documented in table 11 when the surge amplitude increases the magnitude at peak ⅰ and peak ⅱ increases and the frequency remains the same therefore the increase in surge amplitude has no influence on the fluctuation frequency and only increases the turbine load fluctuation amplitude which agrees with the time history of the turbine load at different surge amplitudes as shown in figs 25 and 26 fig 31 shows the power output of the average power output efficiency of the turbine with respect to different surge amplitudes a value of 0 m indicates that the twin rotor system does not oscillate the power output changes little with increasing surge amplitude the surge motion only results in a periodic variation in the current velocity at the rotor disk surface the average velocity change for the turbine disk would be 0 in a given period and the average power output changes little fig 32 shows the single turbine power output spectrum of the twin rotor turbine at different surge amplitudes the detailed parameters of fig 33 are documented in table 12 when the turbine is fixed only peak ⅰ with a frequency of 0 716 hz could be observed the frequency of peak ⅰ is 3 times that of the rotation frequency when the surge amplitude increases the frequency of peak ⅰ remains the same the two highest peaks peak ⅰ and peak ⅱ could be observed when the turbine is in the surge motion compared with the turbine without the surge motion the magnitude of peak ⅰ will decrease when the turbine is in the surge motion while the magnitude at peak ⅱ will increase the frequency of peak ⅰ is equal to the oscillation frequency and the response of peak ⅱ is much larger than that of peak ⅰ therefore the oscillation frequency is the dominant factor for the power output fluctuation the flow field variation characteristics are also studied fig 33 shows the flow field when the turbine is at the equivalent position the rotation of the twin turbine results in jet flow in the middle of the twin turbine the jet flow breaks the continuous vortex into a concentrated vortex compared with the two outer vortex streets the continuity of the vortex street in the middle is worse and the vortex street is more discrete when the surge amplitude increases the instant velocity of the turbine at the equivalent position will increase from 0 8 m s to 1 6 m s thus the outer vortex street in the near flow field is breaking with the increase of surge amplitude pointed out by four boxes even though the surge amplitude increases from 0 8 m to 1 6 m three concentrated vortices could still be observed in the wake flow without any change pointed out by three arrows increasing the surge amplitude will not change the vortex shedding frequency 4 4 influence of the surge frequency it is assumed that the surge frequency of the turbine is identical to that of the wave frequency therefore the common wave frequencies are selected in the simulation namely 0 4 rad s 0 8 rad s 1 rad s 1 2 rad s and 1 6 rad s the incoming flow velocity is 3 m s the tsr is 2 0 the oscillation amplitude is 1 0 m the parameter setup at different surge frequencies is shown in table 13 fig 34 and fig 35 show the time varying curves of the thrust and lateral force coefficients at different surge frequencies the period characteristics of the thrust and lateral force coefficients change little with increasing surge frequency the overall cyclic variation tendencies of the thrust and lateral force coefficients at different surge frequencies are nearly the same except for some slight amplitude differences the peak value of the thrust and lateral force coefficient increases with surge frequency comparing the load time history of the turbine in surge motion with the turbine without surge motion the oscillation motion dramatically changes the time history curve of the turbine thrust and lateral force fig 36 and fig 37 show the spectrum thrust and lateral force of the twin rotor turbine at different surge frequencies a value of 0 rad s means that the turbine is fixed the detailed parameters in figs 36 and 37 are documented in table 14 the two highest peaks peaks ⅰ and ⅱ with frequencies of 0 477 hz and 0 951 hz respectively could be observed when the turbine was at different surge frequencies the frequency of peak ⅰ occurs at 2 times the rotation frequency the frequency of peak ⅱ occurs at 4 times the rotation frequency peak a occurs at 3ffr with an increasing surge frequency the response at peak ⅱ gradually increases however the frequency of peak ⅱ did not change with the surge frequency in figs 34 and 35 the time history fluctuation tendencies of the thrust and lateral forces at different surge frequencies remain the same and the surge frequency only changes the fluctuation amplitude the fluctuation amplitude and average value of the thrust and lateral force coefficients at different surge frequencies are shown in fig 38 and fig 39 the surge frequency has little effect on the average value of the thrust and lateral force coefficients the fluctuation amplitude of the thrust and lateral force coefficients increase with the surge frequency for the same reason different surge frequencies increase the incoming flow velocity fluctuation range but the velocity change in a period would be 0 fig 40 shows the power output of the twin turbine at different surge frequencies as we can see the surge frequency has little effect on the average output of the twin turbine the small fluctuation in the average power output occurs because the velocity change on the turbine disk is periodic the mean velocity change within the turbine disk in a surge motion period is 0 fig 41 shows the single turbine power output spectrum of the twin rotor turbine at three different surge frequencies detailed parameters for the power output spectrum are documented in table 15 peak ⅰ was always be observed for the twin rotor turbine the frequency of peak ⅰ occurs at 3 times the ffr the magnitude at peak ⅰ decreased when the turbine began to oscillate with increasing surge frequency the response at peak ⅰ gradually increases when the turbine was in the surge motion two peaks were observed for the two surge frequencies the frequency of peak ⅱ was 0 127 hz and the frequency was equal to the corresponding ffo when the surge frequency was 0 8 rad s the frequency of peak ⅱ was 0 252 hz and the frequency was also equal to the corresponding ffo when the surge frequency was 1 6 rad s the response at peak ⅱ was larger than that at peak ⅰ when the turbine was at different surge frequencies the oscillation frequency is the dominant factor for the power output fluctuation frequency when the turbine oscillates fig 42 shows the wake flow characteristics of the twin turbine at different surge frequencies the surge frequency influences the vortex shedding frequency the vortex shedding frequency increases with increasing surge frequency and the distribution of the vortex is more dispersed in the wake flow three vortices were observed in the wake flow of the turbine when the oscillation frequency was 0 8 rad s while 5 vortices were observed when the surge frequency increased to 1 6 rad s however the variation in surge frequency has very little effect on the length of wake flow therefore the surge frequency has a greater effect on the frequency of vortex shedding while the surge amplitude has little effect on the vortex shedding frequency 5 discussion in section 4 the influences of the tsr surge amplitude and surge frequency on the turbine load power output efficiency and wake flow characteristics are presented these influences are discussed in terms of several different aspects as shown in figs 22 23 29 30 36 and 37 the two highest peaks could be observed in the turbine load spectrum detailed relationships between those two peaks and the fundamental frequency ffr and ffo are documented in table 16 in figs 22 and 23 the turbine has a high frequency response with increasing tsr in figs 29 and 30 36 and 37 increasing the surge amplitude and surge frequency does not change the peak frequency in the spectrum and only the magnitudes at those peaks increase two peaks have been annotated in those figures peak ⅰ and peak ⅱ the frequencies of peak ⅰ and peak ⅱ are 2 and 4 times the rotation frequency respectively there is no integer multiple relationship between the frequencies of peak ⅰ and peak ⅱ and the surge frequency however this result does not mean that the surge frequency has no influence on the turbine load characteristics in figs 29 and 30 34 37 when the turbine is fixed peaks occur at ffr 2ffr and 3ffr when the turbine starts oscillating peaks occur at ffr 2ffr 3ffr and 4ffr at different surge amplitudes and surge frequencies and the magnitude at 4ffr is the highest therefore the turbine generates a high frequency response when the turbine starts oscillating notably the peaks in the turbine load occur at ffr 2ffr 3ffr and 4ffr but the turbine load has the highest magnitude at 2ffr and 4ffr the multiple relationships between the frequencies of the peaks and the fundamental frequency for the turbine power output are shown in table 17 the responses at peak ⅰ and peak ⅱ are also provided the frequency of peak ⅰ is always three times ffr the multiple frequencies are related to the turbine blade passing frequency each rotor of the twin rotor turbine has 3 identical blades there would be 3 blades passing the same location in a rotation period similar results could also be found in zhao s study zhao et al 2016 and the results showed that there was a complex multiple frequency vibration for a three blade vertical axis turbine the fundamental frequency of torsional vibration was three times that of the rotation frequency in this research since the power output of the turbine is computed by equation 9 during the simulation the torque dynamic characteristics should be the same as the power output characteristics the power output spectrum in different cases shows that the turbine always has the second highest magnitude at 3ffr the frequency of peak ⅱ is equal to ffo in all cases table 17 shows that the magnitude at peak ⅱ is always lower than that at peak ⅰ when the turbine is in the surge motion therefore the surge frequency plays a more important role in the power output characteristics of the turbine increasing the surge amplitude will not change the frequency of peak ⅰ in the power output spectrum but it will increase the magnitude at peak ⅰ the turbine power output will generate a high frequency response with increasing surge frequency and the magnitude at the corresponding ffo will also increase 6 conclusion in this study a new concept of the π type twin rotor tidal current turbines is proposed the rotation and oscillation motions of the twin rotors are combined based on the moving mesh and dynamic mesh techniques the hydrodynamics turbine load characteristics power output characteristics and wake flow characteristics of the twin turbine system are studied in this paper the load coefficient flow field variation and rotor dynamic characteristics are analyzed the conclusions are described as follows 1 the twin rotor turbine system could increase the power output compared with a single turbine the average power output of the twin rotor turbine could increase by as much as 15 3 the mutual interactions between the two rotors tend to increase the power output at a high tsr 2 the surge amplitude and surge frequency would increase the turbine load and power output fluctuation but it will not change the average values of the turbine load and power output the fluctuation amplitude of the lateral force and thrust coefficient is proportional to the surge amplitude and surge frequency 3 the turbine load would have the highest magnitudes at 2ffr and 4 ffr increasing the surge amplitude and surge frequency would increase the magnitudes at those peaks in the spectrum but would not change the frequency of those peaks 4 the turbine power output spectrum shows that the turbine has the highest magnitudes at ffo and 3ffr the surge frequency plays a more important role in the power output characteristics of the turbine increasing the surge amplitude will not change the frequency of peak ⅰ in the power output spectrum but it will increase the magnitude at peak ⅰ the turbine power output will generate a high frequency response with increasing surge frequency and the magnitude at the corresponding ffo will also increase 5 the surge motion of the turbine will break the concentrated vortices into smaller vortices the surge amplitude has no effect on the vortex shedding frequency while the surge frequency increases the vortex shedding frequency causing larger blade load fluctuations credit authorship contribution

observed in the slamming impact load with two peaks irregular wave tests conducted under oblique wave conditions were further used to investigate the characteristics of the slamming impact loads and the velocities of the directional sway and roll motions were found to be significant determinants of the slamming impact load keywords breaking wave irregular wave slamming load wave impact model test fpso 1 introduction offshore structures and ships are subjected to harsh environmental conditions and forces during their operation including critical wave impact loads that slam against them wave impact loads are of two types namely vertical and horizontal wave impact loads vertical wave impact loads such as those that slam against the bottom of offshore structures and ships and wave in deck impact loads are mainly related to the wave induced motions of the floating structure horizontal wave impact loads also frequently occur and may cause fatigue damage of the structure von karman 1929 and wagner 1932 estimated slamming impact loads by an analytical method that utilized a simple model of the structure and their pioneering works inspired several subsequent studies however there is still the need for specific studies on estimating the wave impact loads that slam against ships and offshore structures kapsenberg 2011 several researchers have estimated the slamming load through experiments using pressure sensors and force sensors kapsenberg et al 2002 hermundstad and moan 2005 kapsenberg and thornhull 2010 and voogt and buchner 2004 specifically used pressure sensors to measure the slamming loads however the measured data varied with the characteristics of the pressure sensors kim et al 2015 conducted sloshing tests using four types of pressure sensors namely piezoresistive piezoelectric integrated electronics piezoelectric sensors and explained the differing results to overcome issues related to the sensitivity of pressure sensors some researchers have employed force sensors such as hong et al 2017 huang et al 2015 2017 ha et al 2018 and kim et al 2019 this approach requires the use of special force panels and high natural frequency force sensors and the measured local impact load may differ with the size of the force panel and natural frequency of the sensor the slamming impact loads measured in experiments are of various types huang et al 2017 measured the slamming impact loads on a gbs model in irregular waves and categorized three types based on the impact time series namely general impact loads impact loads with air bubbles and impact loads with mechanical vibration wienke et al 2000 conducted slamming tests on a large vertical cylinder in breaking waves and showed that the characteristics of the slamming impact loads varied with the inclination angle of the cylinder from the determined relationship between the cylinder inclination angle and the shape of the wave crest the slamming impact loads were categorized as one peak and two peak loads more recently computational fluid dynamics cfd has been widely used to evaluate slamming impact loads wang et al 1996 and wang and guedes soares 2012 2013 used cfd to conduct drop tests chen and chen 2015 and seo and jeong 2019 also used cfd to describe the bow and stern slamming loads on container ships in regular waves in the application of cfd the mesh characteristics and the definition of the computational time steps are very important and the simulation of numerous cases are thus required for accurate results ha et al 2019 conducted a numerical simulation of a truncated vertical cylinder in breaking waves and directly compared the results with those of previous experiments although good agreement was observed the numerical simulation could not capture impact loads with two peaks there is thus room for improvement in cfd studies including regarding the mesh time step and free surface boundary conditions in the present study experiments were performed on the slamming impact loads on the bow of a floating production storage and offloading fpso model in breaking waves the incoming waves were generated by the focusing wave method and the slamming impact loads were measured using several force sensors three different heading angles were applied and each experiment was repeated twenty times in addition irregular wave tests were conducted under oblique wave conditions to investigate the characteristics of the horizontal and vertical slamming impact loads 2 experiment 2 1 model the present experimental investigation of slamming impact loads utilized a ship type fpso model in the ocean wave basin of the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso the wave absorber length of the ocean wave basin which is punching plate is 3 2 m and the length breadth and water depth of the ocean wave basin are 56 m 32 m x 3 2 m respectively the model was produced by samsung heavy industries for experimental purposes with a scale of 1 50 fig 1 the principal dimensions of the model are presented in table 1 the bow part was produced from fiber reinforced plastic and has an additional aluminum frame for the installation of 15 force sensors the sensors are tightly arranged to minimize mechanical vibration as shown in fig 2 the 15 kistler 4576 a force sensors have force panels of diameter 50 mm and sampling rate of 20 khz the natural frequency of the force sensors including the force panels is 2 25 khz in the model experiment six degree of freedom 6 dof motions of the fpso model were measured by a non contact optical measurement system as shown in fig 2 to maintain the lateral orientation of the model it was moored by four soft spring wire systems the sampling rates for measuring motions and mooring loads are 200 hz in this study wave elevations were measured with the sampling rate of 200 hz whenever the experiments were performed a high speed camera with a frame rate of 5000 frame s was used to capture the incoming waves at the moment of their impact on the model at a particular time by triggering a time 2 2 test conditions for breaking waves the focusing wave method davis and zarnick 1964 was used to generate the breaking waves fig 3 shows the displacements of the wave maker as repeated five times the frequency range of the focusing wave which had a maximum wave amplitude of 0 22 m was 2 856 5 235 rad s with a peak wave frequency of 3 696 rad s the fpso model was positioned at the focus of the breaking waves located 25 8 m from the wave maker fig 4 a shows the flows of the breaking wave which can be observed to be strongly broken near the wave probe after the wave assumes a curling shape as shown in fig 4 b the generation of the breaking waves was repeated five times and the results were fairly consistent in this study the experiment for each heading angle was repeated 20 times heading angles of 180 165 and 150 were used to investigate the variation of the wave impact loads with the wave heading the wave heading was adjusted based on the stem of the bow forward perpendicular f p as shown in fig 5 for each wave heading the stem of the bow was positioned at the point where the wave broke in this study the slamming load under an irregular wave was evaluated additionally table 2 summarized the environmental conditions 3 experimental results 3 1 wave flows for horizontal slamming in breaking waves fig 6 shows snapshots of the breaking wave as it impacts the fpso model with respect to the heading angle it can be seen from fig 6 a that for a heading angle of 180 the incoming wave has a curling shape near the bow of the fpso model and the slightly sank wave crest then directly hits the bow in the case of a 165 heading as shown in fig 6 b the wave with its curling shape approaches the front of the bow and the wave crest then directly hits the bow similar to the case of a 180 heading the flow patterns for a 150 heading in fig 6 c reveal a similar trend 3 2 characteristics of slamming impact loads of breaking waves in the present study the experiment for each heading angle was repeated twenty times fig 7 shows the relative motion characteristics of the fpso model for a heading angle of 150 the results of the repeated experiments can be seen to be in good agreement the motion of the fpso model is very small before the wave slams into it this indicates that the changes in the relative angle and velocity due to the motion is relatively small and the main parameters of the wave impact may therefore be the relative angle and velocity between the incoming wave and the bow of the fpso model excluding the motion effects however after the wave impact there are large motions of the fpso model figs 8 10 show the slamming impact loads at representative locations on the bow of the fpso model as observed from the 20 experiments repeated for each wave heading angle large impact loads occurred at fb13 fb14 and fb15 the first two of which are located at the maximum amplitude of the incoming wave the loads at the other sensor locations are relatively small because of the large relative angles the figures reveal good agreement between the results of the twenty repeated experiments for each heading angle it has been observed that the variability of the slamming load can be substantial huang et al 2017 in the present study however the difference between the maximum and minimum impact loads among the repeated experiments for each heading angle was not very significant there were some points at which larger differences occurred due to the force sensors not covering the entire area of the bow flare but the overall results do not reveal substantial variations of the magnitude reported by huang et al 2017 as can be seen from fig 8 the slamming loads at fb15 were larger than those at the other sensor locations this is because the relative angle at fb15 was smaller than those at the other sensor locations slamming impact loads with two peaks were also observed at fb13 and fb15 it is possible that the waves later hit the fpso bow again after the wave crest tip with the curling shape directly hitting the bowl at fb14 the slamming loads had one peak because of the direct hit of the broken wave as shown in fig 9 the slamming impact loads are relatively larger than the slamming impact loads for a heading of 180 when the fpso model was rotated to produce a heading of 165 the relative angle between the bow and the incoming wave was reduced this caused an increase in the slamming impact loads with the increase at fb13 being larger for a heading of 150 the largest slamming impact loads occurred at fb13 this heading was the smallest among the three considered and produced the greatest angle effect and largest slamming impact loads as shown in figs 8 10 slamming impact loads with one and two peaks both occurred for each of the considered heading angles fig 11 categorizes the results for the two types of slamming impact loads the categorization was based on observations at the sensor locations where large slamming impact loads occurred fig 11 shows that with decreasing heading from 180 to 150 the slamming impact loads with one peak are amplified because the wave heading was adjusted based on the f p of the fpso model the location of fb15 was slightly moved backward from its initial position when the heading was decreased from 180 to 165 and there is the possibility that the slamming loads with one peak were applied by fully broken waves as shown in fig 12 a when the heading was reduced to 150 although fb13 was slightly moved forward from its initial position it might have still been behind fb15 fig 12 b shows representative time histories of the slamming impact loads with one and two peaks the loads with one peak can be observed to be relatively large in addition in the case of the slamming impact loads with two peaks the larger load occurs first moreover the peaks of the slamming impact loads with one peak are higher than both peaks of the loads with two peaks fig 13 shows the average magnitudes of the slamming impact loads with one peak and two peaks the average magnitudes of the loads with one peak can be seen to be larger than those of the loads with two peaks for all the heading angles in the case of the loads with two peaks the load of the second peak could have been slightly damped by the water on the force panel surface after the first peak 3 3 characteristics of slamming impact loads in irregular wave the characteristics of the slamming impact loads in irregular waves were investigated to determine the significant wave height and peak period of the irregular wave the motion response amplitude operators raos were investigated for a heading of 150 as shown in fig 14 regular and white noise tests whts were conducted and the results were directly compared with those of the model experiment in the frequency domain using the adflow software adflow is a frequency domain hydrodynamic solver developed by kriso using the potential flow method the frequency domain results of the model experiments and whts were in good agreement fig 14 d and e show that the resonance periods of the roll and pitch motions are near 0 5 rad s from the motion tests the peak wave period and wave height in the full scale were determined to be 12 07 s and 11 2 m respectively fig 15 shows the wave spectrum and time history of the wave elevation the model experiments for headings of 165 and 150 were performed for 3 h each based on the full scale fig 16 shows the representative time histories of the slamming impact loads on the bow of the fpso model where relatively large slamming impact loads occurred on fb15 for heading angles of 165 and 150 the relationship between the velocities of the model motions and the slamming impact loads were investigated for the slamming loads with relatively high peaks in the case of the 165 heading the larger slamming impact loads occurred within two time windows as shown in fig 16 the relationship between the velocities of the model motions and the large slamming impact loads was first investigated within the 895 905 s time window the larger slamming impact loads were observed to occur at very low velocities for each directional motion as shown in fig 17 fig 18 a shows that a large wave directly hits the bow of the fpso model after the passage of a smaller wave while fig 18 b shows that the larger slamming impact loads coincide with the larger waves rather than the higher velocities of the model motions this is similar to the indications of the breaking wave tests using horizontal impacts with the wave elevation measured on the far side of the f p of the fpso model in this horizontal impact case a large slamming impact load may occur due to a small angle between the bow of the fpso model and the wave within the second considered time window at 1350 1360 s shown in fig 19 the pitch directional velocity is higher at the moment of the impact fig 20 a shows that the bow of the fpso model moves up to the surface of the water after the large wave passes colliding with the very small wave in fig 20 b the very small wave can be seen to approach the front of the bow after the large wave passes further the magnitudes of the slamming impact loads in figs 17 and 19 are similar indicating that both the vertical and horizontal slamming are significant design factors fig 21 shows the time series of the velocities of the model motions and the large slamming impact load for a heading of 150 the velocities of the horizontal motions of the model can be observed to be relatively low while the roll velocity of the vertical motion is relatively high interestingly under this wave condition the large slamming impact load occurs by the roll motion as shown in fig 22 a the bow of the fpso model collided with the approaching second large wave after the passage of the first large wave in fig 22 b the wave amplitude is relatively small when the bow of the fpso model collides with the surface of the wave this indicates that both the pitch and roll directional velocities are important factors of the large slamming impact load for an oblique wave heading in addition the large slamming impact load may also be affected by the relative angle between the bow of the fpso model and the wave the slamming impact loads in fig 16 are greater than 4 n while the general slamming loads in fig 22 are less than 4 n the slamming impact loads greater than 4 n occurred about seven times for each heading angle the velocity of each directional motion in fig 16 was examined based on the slamming impact loads greater than 4 n fig 23 shows the velocities of the directional motions with the dominant motions highlighted the velocities are arranged in the order of the large forces as is also done in fig 24 it can be observed from fig 23 that the velocities of the sway and roll motions are more important to the slamming impact load for an oblique wave heading compared with that of the yaw motion fig 24 shows the magnitudes of the slamming impact loads greater than 4 n with the experimental results directly compared with the analytically determined values mei et al 1999 the bow part of the fpso model was idealized to a wedge section in the analysis kim et al 2019 to estimate the impact loads the relative velocities and the relative angles were first estimated from the experimental results as shown in fig 25 the slamming coefficients were estimated using the work of chuang 1970 as shown in fig 26 fig 24 shows that the estimated impact loads are smaller than the experimental results with some exception this suggests that it may be difficult to accurately estimate large slamming impact loads analytically the differences between the experimental and analytical results may be attributed to the occurrence of breaking waves in the experiments figs 23 and 24 also show that most of the impact loads for a heading of 165 are determined by the directional surge sway heave and pitch velocities while most of those for a heading of 150 are determined by the directional surge sway and roll velocities the sixth impact load in fig 24 b is caused by the relatively small relative angle fig 25 the results reveal that the directional velocities of the sway and roll motions become increasingly important factors of the slamming impact loads with decreasing wave heading angle the directional velocity of the roll motion is particularly a very important factor for a heading of 150 the pressure coefficients estimated from the experimental results were directly compared with those determined by chuang 1970 as shown in fig 26 because of the smallness of the relative angle the present experimental results are larger than those obtained by chuang 1970 the larger pressure coefficient determined by a breaking wave test should be used to estimate the slamming impact load in the design of an fpso 4 conclusions model experiments were performed to investigate the characteristics of slamming impact loads on the bow of a ship type fpso the following conclusions are drawn from the experimental results the incoming waves develop in front of the fpso model and the breaking waves directly hit the bow of the model the wave slamming phenomena induce motions of the model with the locations of the larger slamming impact loads varying with the wave heading angle relative to the model three heading angles were considered in the present study namely 180 165 and 150 with the largest slamming impact loads observed for 150 the slamming impact loads can be categorized as loads with one peak and two peaks for a heading of 180 are were more slamming impact loads with two peaks while those with one peak are more frequent for a heading of 150 in loads with two peaks the second peak is smaller due to the damping effect of the first slam in an irregular wave test both horizontal and vertical slamming impact loads occur for an oblique wave heading with the directional velocities of the sway and roll motions being very important factors of the slamming impact loads however for a heading of 165 the directional velocity of the pitch motion is the more important factor while it is that of the roll motion for a heading of 150 the analytical solutions obtained by mei et al 1999 are smaller than the present experimental results for representative cases suggesting the need for more accurate analytical methods for estimating the slamming impact loads the pressure coefficients estimated from the presents results are also larger than those determined by chuang 1970 once again suggesting the need for more advanced

slamming impact loads utilized a ship type fpso model in the ocean wave basin of the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso the wave absorber length of the ocean wave basin

at the point where the wave broke in this study the slamming load under an irregular wave was evaluated additionally table 2 summarized the environmental conditions 3 experimental results 3 1 wave flows for horizontal slamming in breaking waves fig 6 shows snapshots of the breaking wave as it impacts the fpso model with respect to the heading angle it can be seen from fig 6 a that for a heading angle of 180 the incoming wave has a curling shape near the bow of the fpso model and the slightly sank wave crest then directly hits the bow in the case of a 165 heading as shown in fig 6 b the wave with its curling shape approaches the front of the bow and the wave crest then directly hits the bow similar to the case of a 180 heading the flow patterns for a 150 heading in fig 6 c reveal a similar trend 3 2 characteristics of slamming impact loads of breaking waves in the present study the experiment for each heading angle was repeated twenty times fig 7 shows the relative motion characteristics of the fpso model for a heading angle of 150 the results of the repeated experiments can be seen to be in good agreement the motion of the fpso model is very small before the wave slams into it this indicates that the changes in the relative angle and velocity due to the motion is relatively small and the main parameters of the wave impact may therefore be the relative angle and velocity between the incoming wave and the bow of the fpso model excluding the motion effects however after the wave impact there are large motions of the fpso model figs 8 10 show the slamming impact loads at representative locations on the bow of the fpso model as observed from the 20 experiments repeated for each wave heading angle large impact loads occurred at fb13 fb14 and fb15 the first two of which are located at the maximum amplitude of the incoming wave the loads at the other sensor locations are relatively small because of the large relative angles the figures reveal good agreement between the results of the twenty repeated experiments for each heading angle it has been observed that the variability of the slamming load can be substantial huang et al 2017 in the present study however the difference between the maximum and minimum impact loads among the repeated experiments for each heading angle was not very significant there were some points at which larger differences occurred due to the force sensors not covering the entire area of the bow flare but the overall results do not reveal substantial variations of the magnitude reported by huang et al 2017 as can be seen from fig 8 the slamming loads at fb15 were larger than those at the other sensor locations this is because the relative angle at fb15 was smaller than those at the other sensor locations slamming impact loads with two peaks were also observed at fb13 and fb15 it is possible that the waves later hit the fpso bow again after the wave crest tip with the curling shape directly hitting the bowl at fb14 the slamming loads had one peak because of the direct hit of the broken wave as shown in fig 9 the slamming impact loads are relatively larger than the slamming impact loads for a heading of 180 when the fpso model was rotated to produce a heading of 165 the relative angle between the bow and the incoming wave was reduced this caused an increase in the slamming impact loads with the increase at fb13 being larger for a heading of 150 the largest slamming impact loads occurred at fb13 this heading was the smallest among the three considered and produced the greatest angle effect and largest slamming impact loads as shown in figs 8 10 slamming impact loads with one and two peaks both occurred for each of the considered heading angles fig 11 categorizes the results for the two types of slamming impact loads the categorization was based on observations at the sensor locations where large slamming impact loads occurred fig 11 shows that with decreasing heading from 180 to 150 the slamming impact loads with one peak are amplified because the wave heading was adjusted based on the f p of the fpso model the location of fb15 was slightly moved backward from its initial position when the heading was decreased from 180 to 165 and there is the possibility that the slamming loads with one peak were applied by fully broken waves as shown in fig 12 a when the heading was reduced to 150 although fb13 was slightly moved forward from its initial position it might have still been behind fb15 fig 12 b shows representative time histories of the slamming impact loads with one and two peaks the loads with one peak can be observed to be relatively large in addition in the case of the slamming impact loads with two peaks the larger load occurs first moreover the peaks of the slamming impact loads with one peak are higher than both peaks of the loads with two peaks fig 13 shows the average magnitudes of the slamming impact loads with one peak and two peaks the average magnitudes of the loads with one peak can be seen to be larger than those of the loads with two peaks for all the heading angles in the case of the loads with two peaks the load of the second peak could have been slightly damped by the water on the force panel surface after the first peak 3 3 characteristics of slamming impact loads in irregular wave the characteristics of the slamming impact loads in irregular waves were investigated to determine the significant wave height and peak period of the irregular wave the motion response amplitude operators raos were investigated for a heading of 150 as shown in fig 14 regular and white noise tests whts were conducted and the results were directly compared with those of the model experiment in the frequency domain using the adflow software adflow is a frequency domain hydrodynamic solver developed by kriso using the potential flow method the frequency domain results of the model experiments and whts were in good agreement fig 14 d and e show that the resonance periods of the roll and pitch motions are near 0 5 rad s from the motion tests the peak wave period and wave height in the full scale were determined to be 12 07 s and 11 2 m respectively fig 15 shows the wave spectrum and time history of the wave elevation the model experiments for headings of 165 and 150 were performed for 3 h each based on the full scale fig 16 shows the representative time histories of the slamming impact loads on the bow of the fpso model where relatively large slamming impact loads occurred on fb15 for heading angles of 165 and 150 the relationship between the velocities of the model motions and the slamming impact loads were investigated for the slamming loads with relatively high peaks in the case of the 165 heading the larger slamming impact loads occurred within two time windows as shown in fig 16 the relationship between the velocities of the model motions and the large slamming impact loads was first investigated within the 895 905 s time window the larger slamming impact loads were observed to occur at very low velocities for each directional motion as shown in fig 17 fig 18 a shows that a large wave directly hits the bow of the fpso model after the passage of a smaller wave while fig 18 b shows that the larger slamming impact loads coincide with the larger waves rather than the higher velocities of the model motions this is similar to the indications of the breaking wave tests using horizontal impacts with the wave elevation measured on the far side of the f p of the fpso model in this horizontal impact case a large slamming impact load may occur due to a small angle between the bow of the fpso model and the wave within the second considered time window at 1350 1360 s shown in fig 19 the pitch directional velocity is higher at the moment of the impact fig 20 a shows that the bow of the fpso model moves up to the surface of the water after the large wave passes colliding with the very small wave in fig 20 b the very small wave can be seen to approach the front of the bow after the large wave passes further the magnitudes of the slamming impact loads in figs 17 and 19 are similar indicating that both the vertical and horizontal slamming are significant design factors fig 21 shows the time series of the velocities of the model motions and the large slamming impact load for a heading of 150 the velocities of the horizontal motions of the model can be observed to be relatively low while the roll velocity of the vertical motion is relatively high interestingly under this wave condition the large slamming impact load occurs by the roll motion as shown in fig 22 a the bow of the fpso model collided with the approaching second large wave after the passage of the first large wave in fig 22 b the wave amplitude is relatively small when the bow of the fpso model collides with the surface of the wave this indicates that both the pitch and roll directional velocities are important factors of the large slamming impact load for an oblique wave heading in addition the large slamming impact load may also be affected by the relative angle between the bow of the fpso model and the wave the slamming impact loads in fig 16 are greater than 4 n while the general slamming loads in fig 22 are less than 4 n the slamming impact loads greater than 4 n occurred about seven times for each heading angle the velocity of each directional motion in fig 16 was examined based on the slamming impact loads greater than 4 n fig 23 shows the velocities of the directional motions with the dominant motions highlighted the velocities are arranged in the order of the large forces as is also done in fig 24 it can be observed from fig 23 that the velocities of the sway and roll motions are more important to the slamming impact load for an oblique wave heading compared with that of the yaw motion fig 24 shows the magnitudes of the slamming impact loads greater than 4 n with the experimental results directly compared with the analytically determined values mei et al 1999 the bow part of the fpso model was idealized to a wedge section in the analysis kim et al 2019 to estimate the impact loads the relative velocities and the relative angles were first estimated from the experimental results as shown in fig 25 the slamming coefficients were estimated using the work of chuang 1970 as shown in fig 26 fig 24 shows that the estimated impact loads are smaller than the experimental results with some exception this suggests that it may be difficult to accurately estimate large slamming impact loads analytically the differences between the experimental and analytical results may be attributed to the occurrence of breaking waves in the experiments figs 23 and 24 also show that most of the impact loads for a heading of 165 are determined by the directional surge sway heave and pitch velocities while most of those for a heading of 150 are determined by the directional surge sway and roll velocities the sixth impact load in fig 24 b is caused by the relatively small relative angle fig 25 the results reveal that the directional velocities of the sway and roll motions become increasingly important factors of the slamming impact loads with decreasing wave heading angle the directional velocity of the roll motion is particularly a very important factor for a heading of 150 the pressure coefficients estimated from the experimental results were directly compared with those determined by chuang 1970 as shown in fig 26 because of the smallness of the relative angle the present experimental results are larger than those obtained by chuang 1970 the larger pressure coefficient determined by a breaking wave test should be used to estimate the slamming impact load in the design of an fpso 4 conclusions model experiments were performed to investigate the characteristics of slamming impact loads on the bow of a ship type fpso the following conclusions are drawn from the experimental results the incoming waves develop in front of the fpso model and the breaking waves directly hit the bow of the model the wave slamming phenomena induce motions of the model with the locations of the larger slamming impact loads varying with the wave heading angle relative to the model three heading angles were considered in the present study namely 180 165 and 150 with the largest slamming impact loads observed for 150 the slamming impact loads can be categorized as loads with one peak and two peaks for a heading of 180 are were more slamming impact loads with two peaks while those with one peak are more frequent for a heading of 150 in loads with two peaks the second peak is smaller due to the damping effect of the first slam in an irregular wave test both horizontal and vertical slamming impact loads occur for an oblique wave heading with the directional velocities of the sway and roll motions being very important factors of the slamming impact loads however for a heading of 165 the directional velocity of the pitch motion is the more important factor while it is that of the roll motion for a heading of 150 the analytical solutions obtained by mei et al 1999 are smaller than the present experimental results for representative cases suggesting the need for more accurate analytical methods for estimating the slamming impact loads the pressure coefficients estimated from the presents results are also larger than those determined by chuang 1970 once again suggesting the need for more advanced

20969,in the tip clearance flow the dominant vortex is the tip leakage vortex tlv which has a significant impact on the hydraulic and cavitation performance of axial flow machinery thus the suppression methods of the tlv are necessary in turbomachinery casing groove is an effective and economical technique among many control methods however its mechanism is still not completely understood in order to reveal the effect mechanism of the casing groove on the tlv numerical investigations of gap flow with groove configurations are carried out a naca0009 hydrofoil with tip gap is selected as the research object two typical groove types vertical groove and horizontal groove are applied on the solid wall respectively efforts are made to analyze the difference of velocity distributions between the two groove cases and the smooth wall case combing with the vortex stability theory the suppression mechanisms of the two types of casing groove are distinguished and uncovered for the vertical groove the tlv intensity is reinforced via the secondary leakage vortex slv at first and then the supply of the axial momentum in the tlv center is cut off leading to a less stable tlv for the horizontal groove the dissipation effect caused by viscosity on the tlv is strong resulting in a weakened tlv keywords groove tlv suppression simulation 1 introduction tip clearance is a common structure in various axial turbine machines tip leakage flow passing through the tip region in the reverse direction of the main flow is generated due to the pressure difference between the pressure side and the suction side of a blade kang and hirsch 1993 such leakage flow can result in serious deterioration of flow pattern liu and tan 2020 and give rise to a kind of tip leakage vortex tlv which is the primary vortex structure in the gap flow in particular cavitation always appears in the tlv center in hydraulic machinery and further causes vibrations and performance reductions han and tan 2020 liu and tan 2018 to minimizes those negative effects passive and active control methods are available as its name implies active control requires extra equipment to eliminate the leakage flow by blowing or sucking fluids for example suder et al 2001 enhanced the stability of an axial compressor by removing the turbulent flow around the blade tip with a kind of tip injection technique however active control usually comes at a high cost and the extra equipment are not conducive to maintain the operational reliability in contrast passive control is more economical and convenient in engineering through some treatments applied on the blade or the casing wall the gap flow state can be improved in all passive control methods groove structure and its variants are most commonly used for instance in the research of tip blade treatments kharati et al kharati koopaee and moallemi 2020 improved the performance of an axial fan with single and double tip grooves they also found that the recirculation zones generated within the tip grooves reduced the flow passage areas and decreased the leakage flow rate fu et al fu et al 2018 song and wang et al 2018 attempted to reduce the tip leakage rate and total pressure drop with honeycomb tips in a turbine cascade and achieved good results liu et al liu and tan 2018 adopted a kind of c shaped slot on a hydrofoil and found the tlv is cut off by the high speed leakage flow passing through the slot as the tip treatment acts directly at the tlv forming position it can suppress the tlv effectively however this method is not available under all circumstances particularly the blade tip thicknesses of the axial flow pump rotor and the ducted propeller blade are typically small to minimize the excretion effect it is difficult to apply groove structures on the tip surfaces thus casing groove is more general in small gap conditions there are two typical groove types used in axial machinery one is slotted in the axial direction and the other is in the centrifugal direction these two groove types have not been strictly defined in the earlier research and they are named differently in this study the names of j groove and c groove are used respectively for brevity two types of casing groove are depicted in one sketch on a meridian plane as shown in fig 1 the j groove has a long axial length and a shallow depth the material object is showed in fig 2 a this technique was first applied on the casing wall of a mixed flow pump by saha et al 2000 they found that the j groove is helpful in reducing the intensities of vortices and cavitation in the pump choi et al 2007 adopted the j groove on the casing of an inducer and the draft tube of a francis turbine to suppress the vortex cavitation and vibration the c groove is a single rectangular groove distributed on casing wall in the circumferential direction as shown in fig 2 b the unitized c grooves are similar to screws so the c groove is also called as the screwed groove in a few literature this type of groove is often used in axial compressors e g muller et al müller et al 2007 and smith et al smith and cumpsty 1984 increased the stall margin of a compressor without significant efficiency reduction through several c groove configurations from the above the casing groove treatment do contribute to improving the gap flow state and mechanical performance in axial machinery however there is no certain conclusion about the effect mechanism of the grooves on the tip leakage flow many scholars have argued on this point gumusel 2008 found that the leakage flow rate is reduced by the grooves thus the axial momentum deficit in the tlv center is reduced however kavurmacioglu et al 2018 took the opposite view they pointed out that the leakage rate is increased under a casing groove condition it results in a high intensity tlv with an expanded core whereas the total loss is decreased moreover through the numerical simulation of a compressor bareiss et al bareiss and vogt 2019 suggested that the groove can modify the intensity and the direction of the tlv the pressure distribution on the blade surface is improved rabe rabe and hah 2002 and hah 2011 hold similar views they considered that the effect of variations in the gap flow direction is a main factor in addition mao et al 2018 suggested the gap flow state is improved due to the suction and unloading effects caused by the groove kang et al 2010 believed that the tlv is trapped in the groove several reasons may be responsible for these obscure explanations first subject to the experimental configuration it is difficult to directly observe the flow inside the casing groove or around the tip thus some flow details are absent in experimental results second previous studies including numerical ones are usually carried out in a whole machine so the result is easily disturbed by many factors e g shear flow caused by the rotation of the rotor and the interference between the rotor and the stator in addition major attentions are focused on the blade performance third casing grooves are not classified the suppression mechanism of two types of groove may not be identical it is biased to try to explain the mechanism with the same reason to remedy these defects and purely reveal the suppression mechanism of grooves numerical simulations of the gap flow with different casing treatments are conducted a naca0009 hydrofoil with tip gap is selected as the research model three wall configurations i e smooth wall vertical groove and horizontal groove are applied on the solid wall respectively combing with the findings about the tlv evolution process gained from our previous work the characteristics of the gap flow field and the tlv are analyzed emphatically 2 numerical method from our previous work the tlv cavitation can slightly affects the leakage rate in small gap conditions however the primary physical mechanisms of the gap flow and the tlv are immune to the cavitation therefore single phase flow simulations were used instead of two phase flow simulations the influence of the turbulence caused by cavitation bubbles is not considered the governing equations of the single phase tip leakage flow field are given as 1 u j x j 0 2 u i t u j u i x j f i 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j the turbulence model is crucial for the accuracy of simulation results reynolds averaged navier stokes rans and large eddy simulation les approaches are widely used in simulations of gap flows in literatures the results of les are more accurate however it has a strict demand for mesh especially near rigid walls leading to a great total mesh number for instance the mesh number decaix et al in their les simulation used a mesh number of up to 300 million decaix et al 2015 which is inapplicable in industrial simulations in contrast the rans method has mature applications as the relative mesh requirements are significantly lower nevertheless some details of the actual turbulent flows are erased in rans simulations therefore to obtain precise numerical results with a reasonable mesh number the hybrid model of the two methods i e the detached eddy simulation des approach is selected in this study the des approach is more capable than rans and les as rans is adopted in near wall regions and switches to a sub grid scale formulation in regions sufficiently fine for les this method was first proposed by spalart 2009 then the improved delayed detached eddy simulation iddes method was developed to avoid possible vortex viscosity mutations and premature flow separations that are triggered by the untimely switch of the model gritskevich et al 2012 shur et al 2008 considering a strong shear flow due to the large pressure difference between the pressure side and the suction side the k ω sst iddes turbulence model is finally selected the rans approach necessitates a separate closure model for describing the effects of turbulence on the mean flow the k ω sst model for an incompressible single phase fluid is formulated as 3 k t u j k x j x j ν σ k ν t k x j p k k 3 2 l 4 ω t u j ω x j x j ν σ ω ν t ω x j p ω β ω 2 2 1 f 1 σ ω 2 ω k x j ω x j where k 1 2 u i u i is the turbulent kinetic energy ω is the specific dissipation rate p k is the shear production term for k ν is the kinematic viscosity ν t is the turbulent kinematic viscosity the switch of turbulence model is controlled by the following equation gritskevich et al 2012 shur et al 2008 5 l l i d f d 1 f e l r a n s 1 f d l l e s in which is the blending function and f e is known as the elevating function gritskevich et al 2012 it is aimed at preventing the excessive reduction of the rans reynolds stresses which has been observed in the interaction of the rans and les regions in the vicinity of their interface shur et al 2008 default constant values in the literature gritskevich et al 2012 shur et al 2008 are used in simulations 3 validation 3 1 influence of the mesh resolution the computational domain of the smooth wall case is showed in fig 3 the gap is set as 2 mm in this study grooves are applied in vertical and horizontal directions respectively on the solid wall the detailed positional parameters are showed in fig 4 groove width and depth are fixed as 1 mm spacing is fixed as 2 mm as the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the suppression mechanism of grooves on the tlv to further inspire some ideas in improving the suppression method on the tlv the parametric studies on the groove size number or the position were not conducted gap flows are generated by a naca0009 straight hydrofoil with chord length c 0 1 m span length l 0 15 m and maximum thickness t 10 mm for the convenience of mesh generation the sharp trailing edge is truncated one side of the hydrofoil is mounted on the fixed wall with an attack angle of 10 leaving a gap between the other side and the solid wall the reynolds number based on c is 1 10 6 with a uniform inlet velocity of 10 m s the position coordinates are normalized by c the incoming velocity in this simulation is used to normalize the velocity field and other quantities such as vorticity field or dissipation field the uniform outlet pressure is set to 1 10 5 pa the detailed boundary conditions are listed in table 1 all the numerical steps are carried out on the openfoam platform which is an open source software platform for the computation of partial differential equations the convergence criterion is 1 10 6 the time step used in this study is decided by the courant number the max courant number is set as 0 4 and the time step is approximately 2 10 7 other detailed numerical steps has been presented in our previous papers chen et al 2019 mesh resolution is another vital issue in cfd for gap flow simulations in the earlier research on the groove treatment for the convenience of the mesh generation interface methods were always adopted these methods will result in two separated computational domains i e the main flow domain and the groove domain however the interface method can lead to inconsistencies of the flow filed using the les approach therefore global mesh generations are realized by a cutting mesh method in this research as shown in fig 5 homogeneous grids are used in groove regions whereas the regions around the hydrofoil surface are refined with prism mesh mesh independence verification has been carried with the large gap case 10 mm in our previous study as showed in fig 6 and table 2 first the vorticity field is time averaged in 0 2s to obtain a mean value then the dimensionless mean vorticity is obtained based on the inlet velocity which is 10 m s we can see that both the time averaged axial vorticity distribution and lift coefficient of mesh3 are close to the result of mesh4 with a smaller mesh number thus mesh3 is selected the final mesh number for the smooth wall case is 8 5 million and approximately 11 million for groove cases the y based on the friction velocity at the nearest wall is within the range of 30 50 for the pressure and suction surfaces and is about 5 for groove surfaces the boundary layers are not enough refined to ensure a y of 1 therefore the wall law is used in this study allmaras and johnson 2012 kalitzin et al 2005 instead of directly calculating the boundary layers 3 2 comparison of numerical and experimental results dreyer et al 2014 provided velocity distributions experimentally under the smooth wall condition at three downstream axial positions where x c 1 1 2 and 1 5 the experiment is conducted with combinations of various gaps attack angles and inlet flow velocities under cavitation condition by using stereo particle image velocity spiv techniques some of the experimental results are used to valid the numerical simulation results in this study the green lines showed in fig 7 represent the predicted tlv trajectories which are calculated via the velocity gradient tensors the white lines denote the tlv cavitation trajectories recorded by the experiments their passing positions at x c 1 and x c 1 2 are marked with yellow crosses it can be seen that the predicted tlv trajectories are consistent with the experimental results the validation of the velocity fields should also be performed the averaged axial velocity distributions for two smooth wall cases are displayed in fig 8 the coordinate system used in the experiment research in the reference is set on the solid wall and the streamwise shares the same direction with the x direction it is different from the coordinate system used in this study therefore to compare the numerical result with the experimental results in detail the coordinate system of the numerical result in fig 8 was converted to keep consistent with the experiment thus the coordinate inside the sections in fig 8 are marked with x and y the boundary layer of the solid wall is thicker in the experimental result as the reducing pipe upstream the test section is long enough to create a fully developed boundary layer however this part was not considered in the numerical study subjecting to the computational cost therefore there is a little difference of the boundary layer thickness between the experimental result and the numerical result similar numerical result also exists in the literature decaix et al 2015 guo et al 2018 it has small influence on the leakage rate and the leakage jet speed nevertheless it does not change the physical mechanism of the gap flow for the 10 mm gap τ 1 0 the peak velocity region in the tlv core is well presented this type of velocity distribution in the core is called jet like axial flow as it exceeds the main flow the low speed velocity areas between the tlv and the solid wall are also captured for the 2 mm gap τ 0 2 a deficit of axial velocity distribution appears in the tlv core this state could be described as a wake like axial flow the shape of the peak velocity area in the large gap case is close to the experimental result the tlv core position as well as the velocity magnitude in the tlv center predicted by the des method of the small gap case are consistent with the experimental results in the literature decaix et al 2018 both rans and les approaches were adopted in the simulations of gap flows the les approach can provide a better result than the rans approach nonetheless the total mesh number used in the les computations is up to 300 million for the rans computations a structured mesh with approximately 2 8 million nodes is used in contrast des captured the velocity peak magnitudes and tlv positions precisely with a reasonable amount 9 6 million in addition the accuracy of the vorticity field is improved by cutting mesh method the mean dimensionless axial vorticity field in the two groove cases are showed in fig 9 it can be seen that a strong viscous shear flow is generated inside the grooves in the vertical groove case owing to the large pressure difference between the pressure side and the suction side results in a type of secondary leakage vortex slv for the horizontal groove case multiple induced vortices are filled in grooves it seems like the boundary layer of the solid wall is thickened the axial vorticity distribution around the tip sways in the spanwise direction especially at section x c 0 025 as the interaction between the leakage jet and the boundary layer is aggravated such phenomenons have not been reported in the research which adopted the interface method from the above the numerical method used in this study is successful 4 results and discussions first of all to examine the effect of grooves on suppressing the tlv the pressure coefficient c p is defined as 6 c p p i p 0 0 5 ρ u i n 2 where p i represents the static pressure of the cell i u i n is the incoming velocity which is 10 m s ρ is the density of the liquid p 0 is the standard atmospheric pressure fig 10 shows the distributions of c p in the three cases in several axial sections compared with the smooth wall case the low pressure magnitude caused by the tlv is larger in the groove cases at downstream positions after x c 0 1 besides the vorticity peak areas at downstream positions are reduced significantly in the groove cases as shown in fig 11 the difference is that in the vertical groove case the tlv is stronger near the leading edge as well as the induced vortex iv for the horizontal groove case the tlv is weaker in the whole evolution process therefore both types of groove show suppression effects on the tlv however the mechanisms may not be identical 4 1 effects of grooves on the tlv trajectory macroscopic characteristics of the tlv in the three cases are first analyzed the tlv trajectories in the groove cases are much closer to the suction surface as showed in figs 10 and 11 the spanwise velocity is the immediate cause of the rolling up motion of the tlv when the spanwise velocity becomes significant the leakage flow will leave the gap region further results in the formation of the tlv so the difference in tlv trajectory heights can be revealed via the continuity equation in a two dimensional plane as shown in fig 12 the continuity equation of a 2d flow is given by eq 7 in which v and w are the vertical and spanwise components of velocity respectively and δ is the gap width by integrating eq 7 we obtain eq 8 assuming that v is uniform inside the gap and the spanwise velocity on the solid wall surface w 0 is zero then we obtain eq 9 it is clear that the spanwise velocity on the tip side is approximately linearly proportional to the gap size and the vertical velocity gradient for the vertical groove case the groove configuration shares the similar effect with a local enlarged gap in addition the high intensity iv showed in fig 11 can reduce the vertical jet intensity and contribute to a large spanwise w δ for the horizontal groove case the vorticity field reveals that there are a lot of small induced vortices inside the grooves the penetration ability of the leakage jet is weakened as its adverse vertical gradient is enhanced by these induced vortices thus the formation positions of the tlv in the two groove cases are lower than the smooth case 4 2 effects of the grooves on the gap flow in this study the suppression mechanism of the grooves on the tlv is investigated from the perspective of the vortex stability theory in the earlier research on the vortex stability sarpkaya 1971a 1971b observed three types of vortex breakdown double helix spiral and bubble types the breakdown of the tlv in the smooth wall case has similarities with the spiral mode hall 1967 found that there is a streamwise adverse pressure gradient along the vortex center line and it increases with the enhancement of the vortex intensity such adverse pressure gradient is regarded as the main cause of the vortex breakdown devenport et al 1996 according to the balance between the radial pressure gradient and the centrifugal force escudier 1988 obtained eq 10 to predict the pressure gradient at the vortex center if the vortex core grows the second term on the right hand of eq 10 is always positive this manifests that the adverse pressure gradient can be generated at the vortex center even the ambient pressure gradient is negative finally leading to a reduction in the axial velocity therefore for a growing vortex a stagnant point with reversed velocity may be caused by the adverse pressure gradient at the vortex center thereafter the axial flow concentrated in the vortex core with an appreciable velocity may decelerate and diverge as if a solid obstacle was met hall 1967 10 p x r 0 p x ρ 0 γ r 3 γ r v r u x d r 11 θ t a n 1 v t u x independent studies of the vortex stability are usually carried out in cylindrical tubes to control some parameters however the tlv is rather complex since it involves the boundary layer interactions and the multiple vortex merging in addition the three components of the tlv velocity are not constant during the evolutionary process thus it is a challenging task to estimate the tlv stability through eq 10 to overcome these difficulties a local vortex parameter the swirl angle is denoted as eq 11 hall 1967 found that the maximum value of θ before the breakdown position is invariably greater than 50 other scholars have made similar findings krause 1985 suggested that the distance a vortex moves downstream stably is inversely proportional to the square of the maximum vortex tangential velocity and proportional to the square of the axial velocity using a simulation narain 1977 found that if the swirl angle increases the diffusion of the vortex will be enhanced casing the breakdown position to move upstream therefore the vortex stability is mainly related with two velocity parameters i e the tangential velocity and the axial velocity thus these two parameters are discussed respectively in following subsections 4 2 1 tangential velocity analysis the tangential velocity of the tlv under small gap conditions always shows asymmetric characteristics on account of strong interactions between the gap flow and the solid wall the tangential velocity distribution in the spanwise contains vital vortex information such as the maximum tangential velocity magnitude and the maximum vortex core radius thus the investigation of the tangential velocity of the tlv is focused in the spanwise direction as shown in fig 13 in the smooth wall case tangential velocity curves are more order on the near wall side when groove structures are applied the tlv interacts with the low speed flow inside the grooves resulting in chaotic distributions at the tip side for the vertical groove case as the section x c 0 3 cuts into a groove the tangential velocity drops steeply in the groove at z c 1 5 there is an m shaped distribution near the tip it is caused by the combined action of the tlv and the slv as the sampled line in spanwise passed through the two vortices simultaneously this phenomenon is not found in the horizontal groove case the tangential velocity peak values in the two groove cases are also different compared with the smooth wall case the tlv under the vertical groove case is hindered by the iv seriously leading to a slight reduction in the maximum tangential velocity magnitude in the horizontal groove case the maximum tangential velocity decreases significantly even the iv is weak this attributes to the difference in the leakage rate on the cross sectional plane through the foil chord in the gap region the leakage rate q l is calculated by integrating the leakage velocity on the cross sectional plane the results are shown in table 3 for the vertical groove case the leakage rate is larger as the averaged gap size is increased for the horizontal groove case the leakage jet is weakened by counter rotating vortices i e small iv inside the grooves resulting in a smaller leakage rate in small gap size conditions it can be considered that the leakage flow is basically converted into the tlv therefore the tlv can get a high intensity in the vertical groove case the iv above the tlv is correspondingly strengthened the opposite result is presented in the horizontal groove case in addition it can also be found in table 3 that when the tlv is suppressed the hydrofoil lift coefficient decreases it is consistent with the kutta joukowski theorem it implies that the suppression of the tlv may cause an adverse impact on the blade performance 4 2 2 axial velocity analysis the difference in the axial flow state between the two groove cases is significant as shown in fig 14 for the vertical groove the axial velocity in the tlv center is jet like before x c 0 0 then turns into a wake like state downstream x c 0 1 the near suction surface regions are full of high speed flow which is similar to the smooth case for the horizontal groove case the jet like axial flow state in the tlv center is less obvious a more detailed comparison of the axial velocity value in the tlv center is listed in table 4 in can be seen that the jet like axial flow state presents in the tlv center near the leading for the three cases it is consistent with lee s report that the jet like axial flow is always presents in vortex center during the vortex formation period lee and pereira 2010 the most notable difference is that the axial velocity in the tlv center under the vertical groove configuration exceeds the values in the two other cases before x c 0 0 thereafter it drops abruptly in the other two cases the axial velocity decreases smoothly qualitative investigations of the axial velocity in the tlv center can be carried out according to the formula proposed by batchelor 1964 in cylindrical coordinates the equations of motion for the steady axisymmetric flow of an incompressible fluid can be reduced to eq 12 where u x v r and v t are the axial radial and tangential velocity components respectively without considering vortex growth i e neglecting the radial velocity the relationship between the tangential velocity and the radial pressure gradient can be simplified as eq 13 by integrating it and combining with the bernoulli equation we obtain eq 14 where γ is the vortex circulation δ h denotes a function that accounts for the viscous losses along a streamline passing through the boundary layer of the surface where the effect of viscous forces is appreciable this equation shows that there are two types of effects on the axial velocity in the vortex center inviscid swirl acceleration effect and viscous dissipation effect the axial velocity will increase if the core size or viscous loss decreases and the vortex intensity increases 12 u x v r x v r v r r v t 2 r 1 ρ p r ν 2 v r v r r 2 13 v t 2 r 1 ρ p r 14 u r 0 2 u 2 2 r 1 4 π 2 r 2 γ 2 r d r 2 δ h besides the swirl motion effect and the viscus dissipation a kind of local suction blowing action exists in the groove cases therefore momentum exchange happens on the interfacial plane that between the grooves and the gap the momentum transport attributed to the grooves can be detected through an axial momentum transport rate 15 π x u z u x u i n u i n the π x along the projected line of the foil chord on the interfacial plane is sampled as shown in fig 15 considering the flow direction there are four possible combinations as listed in table 5 the symbol of and donates the direction according to the cartesian coordinate system in fig 3 the suction or blowing effect caused by the grooves is decided by the direction of u z therefore a positive π x indicates the grooves blow out the negative axial momentum in the grooves or suck in the positive axial momentum from the gap flow which weakens the axial velocity in the tlv center while negative π x means the grooves blow out the positive axial momentum in the grooves or sucking in the negative axial momentum from the gap flow which enhances the axial velocity in the tlv center it can be seen in fig 15 that the sampled π x in the vertical groove case is almost negative denoting that the grooves especially the ones near the leading edge of the hydrofoil have a significantly reinforcement effect on the axial momentum of the tlv the similar effect exists in the horizontal groove case with less intense which can be neglected to clarify the situation uniformly spaced sampling lines in the pitchwise on the interfacial plane are selected and marked as λ as shown in fig 16 π x is integrated on the sampled lines it is clear in fig 16 that beneath the hydrofoil the integrated π x is positive then turns into negative in the gap it suggests that the fluid inside the gap is sucked into the grooves beneath the pressure surface and then blew out at a higher position for the vertical groove case the slv showed in fig 9 is formed owing to the shear flow inside the gap thereafter it is absorbed into the leakage flow via the blowing effect as the axial velocity in the center of a vortex must be positive if the vortex is stable the slv is an important momentum carrier variation laws of vortex intensity after the merging of two co rotor vortices were studied by dritschel et al dritschel and waugh 1992 who found that the merged vortex is invariably stronger than previous individuals folz et al folz and nomura 2017 also pointed out that the vortex after merging is about 1 01 1 60 times stronger than the previous ones these results are consistent with the significant increases of the tlv intensity and the axial velocity in the tlv center for the vertical groove case thus it can be confirmed that both the intensity and axial velocity of the tlv are enhanced extremely through the merging of the tlv and slv at upstream positions in the vertical groove case however for the horizontal groove case such compensation effect is almost absent regarding the viscous dissipation caused by the interaction between the tlv and the iv or the boundary layer it can be detected through the dissipation term from the energy equation of a steady incompressible flow as shown in eq 16 in which ν e f f ν ν t is the effective viscosity the results are shown in fig 17 there are clear dissipation distributions around the tip and inside the grooves in the both cases for the vertical groove the dissipation merely concentrates at upstream positions however it is more serious in the horizontal groove case as it covered the regions that the leakage jet and the tlv passing by so far the causes of axial flow states in the tlv center can be revealed for the vertical groove case the slv directly enhances the tlv intensity and the axial momentum simultaneously before x c 0 1 this caused the jet like axial flow state at the upstream positions however the compensation action ceases abruptly making the flow state turn into a wake like state for the horizontal groove case the acceleration effect caused by the swirl motion on the axial velocity in the tlv center is weak due to the low vortex intensity together with a stronger viscous dissipation resulting in a smaller axial velocity value in the tlv center 16 φ ν e f f u i x j ν e f f 2 u i x j u j x i 2 4 2 3 stability analysis finally the swirl angle in the three cases are obtained as shown in fig 18 for the vertical groove case the swirl angle maintains small before x c 0 0 as the axial momentum is resupplied via the slv this supplement disappeared subsequently however the enhancement on the tlv intensity the tsv has made is still exist giving rise to a steep increase on the swirl angle downstream x c 0 1 the tlv becomes unstably rapidly at this position and breaks down for the horizontal groove case the momentum exchange between the grooves and the gap flow is barely exist the dissipation effect dominates in the whole evolution process resulting in a more stable but weaker tlv than the other two cases 5 conclusion and discussion in this study two types of most commonly used casing grooves are distinguished i e the vertical groove and the horizontal groove based on their slot directions behaviors of the tlv and the gap flow under different solid wall conditions are numerically investigated the k ω sst iddes turbulence model is selected to solve the flow field which is helpful in providing accurate numerical results both the two types of grooves show suppression effects on the tlv and also bring the tlv trajectory close to the suction surface owing to the enlarged local gap size or the large adverse vertical velocity gradient this phenomenon implies that tlv cavitation bubbles may collapse near the blade suction surface there are strong shear flows inside the vertical grooves giving birth to a type of secondary leakage vortex slv near the leading edge in addition the local suction blowing effect is strong in the vertical groove case near the leading edge it leads to the merging of the tlv and the slv further enhances the tlv intensity and the axial velocity in the tlv center for the horizontal groove case such local suction blowing effect is almost absent on the contrary the viscous dissipation effect is more stronger than that in the vertical groove case resulting in a low intensity tlv from the perspective of the vortex stability theory the suppression mechanism of the two casing groove methods on the tlv is different for the vertical groove the momentum exchange is the main factor it increases the tlv intensity at upstream positions and then shuts down the axial momentum supply at a downstream position makes the tlv loss its stability thus it seems like the tlv is cut off however this method may against to the purpose to improve the anti cavitation ability in hydraulic machinery as the breakdown of a high intensity vortex may lead to a fierce cavitation erosion moreover the collapse positions of the tlv cavitation bubbles are probably very close to the foil surface in contrast the suppression effect on the tlv of the horizontal groove is mainly generated via the viscous dissipation the counter rotating vortices exists inside the grooves can hinder the development of the leakage jet leading to a low intensity tlv it manifests that thicken the boundary layers on the casing wall may be a better option for suppressing the tlv in axial hydraulic machinery credit authorship contribution statement zhen bi conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing

20969,in the tip clearance flow the dominant vortex is the tip leakage vortex tlv which has a significant impact on the hydraulic and cavitation performance of axial flow machinery thus the suppression methods of the tlv are necessary in turbomachinery casing groove is an effective and economical technique among many control methods however its mechanism is still not completely understood in order to reveal the effect mechanism of the casing groove on the tlv numerical investigations of gap flow with groove configurations are carried out a naca0009 hydrofoil with tip gap is selected as the research object two typical groove types vertical groove and horizontal groove are applied on the solid wall respectively efforts are made to analyze the difference of velocity distributions between the two groove cases and the smooth wall case combing with the vortex stability theory the suppression mechanisms of the two types of casing groove are distinguished and uncovered for the vertical groove the tlv intensity is reinforced via the secondary leakage vortex slv at first and then the supply of the axial momentum in the tlv center is cut off leading to a less stable tlv for the horizontal groove the dissipation effect caused by viscosity on the tlv is strong resulting in a weakened tlv keywords groove tlv suppression simulation 1 introduction tip clearance is a common structure in various axial turbine machines tip leakage flow passing through the tip region in the reverse direction of the main flow is generated due to the pressure difference between the pressure side and the suction side of a blade kang and hirsch 1993 such leakage flow can result in serious deterioration of flow pattern liu and tan 2020 and give rise to a kind of tip leakage vortex tlv which is the primary vortex structure in the gap flow in particular cavitation always appears in the tlv center in hydraulic machinery and further causes vibrations and performance reductions han and tan 2020 liu and tan 2018 to minimizes those negative effects passive and active control methods are available as its name implies active control requires extra equipment to eliminate the leakage flow by blowing or sucking fluids for example suder et al 2001 enhanced the stability of an axial compressor by removing the turbulent flow around the blade tip with a kind of tip injection technique however active control usually comes at a high cost and the extra equipment are not conducive to maintain the operational reliability in contrast passive control is more economical and convenient in engineering through some treatments applied on the blade or the casing wall the gap flow state can be improved in all passive control methods groove structure and its variants are most commonly used for instance in the research of tip blade treatments kharati et al kharati koopaee and moallemi 2020 improved the performance of an axial fan with single and double tip grooves they also found that the recirculation zones generated within the tip grooves reduced the flow passage areas and decreased the leakage flow rate fu et al fu et al 2018 song and wang et al 2018 attempted to reduce the tip leakage rate and total pressure drop with honeycomb tips in a turbine cascade and achieved good results liu et al liu and tan 2018 adopted a kind of c shaped slot on a hydrofoil and found the tlv is cut off by the high speed leakage flow passing through the slot as the tip treatment acts directly at the tlv forming position it can suppress the tlv effectively however this method is not available under all circumstances particularly the blade tip thicknesses of the axial flow pump rotor and the ducted propeller blade are typically small to minimize the excretion effect it is difficult to apply groove structures on the tip surfaces thus casing groove is more general in small gap conditions there are two typical groove types used in axial machinery one is slotted in the axial direction and the other is in the centrifugal direction these two groove types have not been strictly defined in the earlier research and they are named differently in this study the names of j groove and c groove are used respectively for brevity two types of casing groove are depicted in one sketch on a meridian plane as shown in fig 1 the j groove has a long axial length and a shallow depth the material object is showed in fig 2 a this technique was first applied on the casing wall of a mixed flow pump by saha et al 2000 they found that the j groove is helpful in reducing the intensities of vortices and cavitation in the pump choi et al 2007 adopted the j groove on the casing of an inducer and the draft tube of a francis turbine to suppress the vortex cavitation and vibration the c groove is a single rectangular groove distributed on casing wall in the circumferential direction as shown in fig 2 b the unitized c grooves are similar to screws so the c groove is also called as the screwed groove in a few literature this type of groove is often used in axial compressors e g muller et al müller et al 2007 and smith et al smith and cumpsty 1984 increased the stall margin of a compressor without significant efficiency reduction through several c groove configurations from the above the casing groove treatment do contribute to improving the gap flow state and mechanical performance in axial machinery however there is no certain conclusion about the effect mechanism of the grooves on the tip leakage flow many scholars have argued on this point gumusel 2008 found that the leakage flow rate is reduced by the grooves thus the axial momentum deficit in the tlv center is reduced however kavurmacioglu et al 2018 took the opposite view they pointed out that the leakage rate is increased under a casing groove condition it results in a high intensity tlv with an expanded core whereas the total loss is decreased moreover through the numerical simulation of a compressor bareiss et al bareiss and vogt 2019 suggested that the groove can modify the intensity and the direction of the tlv the pressure distribution on the blade surface is improved rabe rabe and hah 2002 and hah 2011 hold similar views they considered that the effect of variations in the gap flow direction is a main factor in addition mao et al 2018 suggested the gap flow state is improved due to the suction and unloading effects caused by the groove kang et al 2010 believed that the tlv is trapped in the groove several reasons may be responsible for these obscure explanations first subject to the experimental configuration it is difficult to directly observe the flow inside the casing groove or around the tip thus some flow details are absent in experimental results second previous studies including numerical ones are usually carried out in a whole machine so the result is easily disturbed by many factors e g shear flow caused by the rotation of the rotor and the interference between the rotor and the stator in addition major attentions are focused on the blade performance third casing grooves are not classified the suppression mechanism of two types of groove may not be identical it is biased to try to explain the mechanism with the same reason to remedy these defects and purely reveal the suppression mechanism of grooves numerical simulations of the gap flow with different casing treatments are conducted a naca0009 hydrofoil with tip gap is selected as the research model three wall configurations i e smooth wall vertical groove and horizontal groove are applied on the solid wall respectively combing with the findings about the tlv evolution process gained from our previous work the characteristics of the gap flow field and the tlv are analyzed emphatically 2 numerical method from our previous work the tlv cavitation can slightly affects the leakage rate in small gap conditions however the primary physical mechanisms of the gap flow and the tlv are immune to the cavitation therefore single phase flow simulations were used instead of two phase flow simulations the influence of the turbulence caused by cavitation bubbles is not considered the governing equations of the single phase tip leakage flow field are given as 1 u j x j 0 2 u i t u j u i x j f i 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j the turbulence model is crucial for the accuracy of simulation results reynolds averaged navier stokes rans and large eddy simulation les approaches are widely used in simulations of gap flows in literatures the results of les are more accurate however it has a strict demand for mesh especially near rigid walls leading to a great total mesh number for instance the mesh number decaix et al in their les simulation used a mesh number of up to 300 million decaix et al 2015 which is inapplicable in industrial simulations in contrast the rans method has mature applications as the relative mesh requirements are significantly lower nevertheless some details of the actual turbulent flows are erased in rans simulations therefore to obtain precise numerical results with a reasonable mesh number the hybrid model of the two methods i e the detached eddy simulation des approach is selected in this study the des approach is more capable than rans and les as rans is adopted in near wall regions and switches to a sub grid scale formulation in regions sufficiently fine for les this method was first proposed by spalart 2009 then the improved delayed detached eddy simulation iddes method was developed to avoid possible vortex viscosity mutations and premature flow separations that are triggered by the untimely switch of the model gritskevich et al 2012 shur et al 2008 considering a strong shear flow due to the large pressure difference between the pressure side and the suction side the k ω sst iddes turbulence model is finally selected the rans approach necessitates a separate closure model for describing the effects of turbulence on the mean flow the k ω sst model for an incompressible single phase fluid is formulated as 3 k t u j k x j x j ν σ k ν t k x j p k k 3 2 l 4 ω t u j ω x j x j ν σ ω ν t ω x j p ω β ω 2 2 1 f 1 σ ω 2 ω k x j ω x j where k 1 2 u i u i is the turbulent kinetic energy ω is the specific dissipation rate p k is the shear production term for k ν is the kinematic viscosity ν t is the turbulent kinematic viscosity the switch of turbulence model is controlled by the following equation gritskevich et al 2012 shur et al 2008 5 l l i d f d 1 f e l r a n s 1 f d l l e s in which is the blending function and f e is known as the elevating function gritskevich et al 2012 it is aimed at preventing the excessive reduction of the rans reynolds stresses which has been observed in the interaction of the rans and les regions in the vicinity of their interface shur et al 2008 default constant values in the literature gritskevich et al 2012 shur et al 2008 are used in simulations 3 validation 3 1 influence of the mesh resolution the computational domain of the smooth wall case is showed in fig 3 the gap is set as 2 mm in this study grooves are applied in vertical and horizontal directions respectively on the solid wall the detailed positional parameters are showed in fig 4 groove width and depth are fixed as 1 mm spacing is fixed as 2 mm as the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the suppression mechanism of grooves on the tlv to further inspire some ideas in improving the suppression method on the tlv the parametric studies on the groove size number or the position were not conducted gap flows are generated by a naca0009 straight hydrofoil with chord length c 0 1 m span length l 0 15 m and maximum thickness t 10 mm for the convenience of mesh generation the sharp trailing edge is truncated one side of the hydrofoil is mounted on the fixed wall with an attack angle of 10 leaving a gap between the other side and the solid wall the reynolds number based on c is 1 10 6 with a uniform inlet velocity of 10 m s the position coordinates are normalized by c the incoming velocity in this simulation is used to normalize the velocity field and other quantities such as vorticity field or dissipation field the uniform outlet pressure is set to 1 10 5 pa the detailed boundary conditions are listed in table 1 all the numerical steps are carried out on the openfoam platform which is an open source software platform for the computation of partial differential equations the convergence criterion is 1 10 6 the time step used in this study is decided by the courant number the max courant number is set as 0 4 and the time step is approximately 2 10 7 other detailed numerical steps has been presented in our previous papers chen et al 2019 mesh resolution is another vital issue in cfd for gap flow simulations in the earlier research on the groove treatment for the convenience of the mesh generation interface methods were always adopted these methods will result in two separated computational domains i e the main flow domain and the groove domain however the interface method can lead to inconsistencies of the flow filed using the les approach therefore global mesh generations are realized by a cutting mesh method in this research as shown in fig 5 homogeneous grids are used in groove regions whereas the regions around the hydrofoil surface are refined with prism mesh mesh independence verification has been carried with the large gap case 10 mm in our previous study as showed in fig 6 and table 2 first the vorticity field is time averaged in 0 2s to obtain a mean value then the dimensionless mean vorticity is obtained based on the inlet velocity which is 10 m s we can see that both the time averaged axial vorticity distribution and lift coefficient of mesh3 are close to the result of mesh4 with a smaller mesh number thus mesh3 is selected the final mesh number for the smooth wall case is 8 5 million and approximately 11 million for groove cases the y based on the friction velocity at the nearest wall is within the range of 30 50 for the pressure and suction surfaces and is about 5 for groove surfaces the boundary layers are not enough refined to ensure a y of 1 therefore the wall law is used in this study allmaras and johnson 2012 kalitzin et al 2005 instead of directly calculating the boundary layers 3 2 comparison of numerical and experimental results dreyer et al 2014 provided velocity distributions experimentally under the smooth wall condition at three downstream axial positions where x c 1 1 2 and 1 5 the experiment is conducted with combinations of various gaps attack angles and inlet flow velocities under cavitation condition by using stereo particle image velocity spiv techniques some of the experimental results are used to valid the numerical simulation results in this study the green lines showed in fig 7 represent the predicted tlv trajectories which are calculated via the velocity gradient tensors the white lines denote the tlv cavitation trajectories recorded by the experiments their passing positions at x c 1 and x c 1 2 are marked with yellow crosses it can be seen that the predicted tlv trajectories are consistent with the experimental results the validation of the velocity fields should also be performed the averaged axial velocity distributions for two smooth wall cases are displayed in fig 8 the coordinate system used in the experiment research in the reference is set on the solid wall and the streamwise shares the same direction with the x direction it is different from the coordinate system used in this study therefore to compare the numerical result with the experimental results in detail the coordinate system of the numerical result in fig 8 was converted to keep consistent with the experiment thus the coordinate inside the sections in fig 8 are marked with x and y the boundary layer of the solid wall is thicker in the experimental result as the reducing pipe upstream the test section is long enough to create a fully developed boundary layer however this part was not considered in the numerical study subjecting to the computational cost therefore there is a little difference of the boundary layer thickness between the experimental result and the numerical result similar numerical result also exists in the literature decaix et al 2015 guo et al 2018 it has small influence on the leakage rate and the leakage jet speed nevertheless it does not change the physical mechanism of the gap flow for the 10 mm gap τ 1 0 the peak velocity region in the tlv core is well presented this type of velocity distribution in the core is called jet like axial flow as it exceeds the main flow the low speed velocity areas between the tlv and the solid wall are also captured for the 2 mm gap τ 0 2 a deficit of axial velocity distribution appears in the tlv core this state could be described as a wake like axial flow the shape of the peak velocity area in the large gap case is close to the experimental result the tlv core position as well as the velocity magnitude in the tlv center predicted by the des method of the small gap case are consistent with the experimental results in the literature decaix et al 2018 both rans and les approaches were adopted in the simulations of gap flows the les approach can provide a better result than the rans approach nonetheless the total mesh number used in the les computations is up to 300 million for the rans computations a structured mesh with approximately 2 8 million nodes is used in contrast des captured the velocity peak magnitudes and tlv positions precisely with a reasonable amount 9 6 million in addition the accuracy of the vorticity field is improved by cutting mesh method the mean dimensionless axial vorticity field in the two groove cases are showed in fig 9 it can be seen that a strong viscous shear flow is generated inside the grooves in the vertical groove case owing to the large pressure difference between the pressure side and the suction side results in a type of secondary leakage vortex slv for the horizontal groove case multiple induced vortices are filled in grooves it seems like the boundary layer of the solid wall is thickened the axial vorticity distribution around the tip sways in the spanwise direction especially at section x c 0 025 as the interaction between the leakage jet and the boundary layer is aggravated such phenomenons have not been reported in the research which adopted the interface method from the above the numerical method used in this study is successful 4 results and discussions first of all to examine the effect of grooves on suppressing the tlv the pressure coefficient c p is defined as 6 c p p i p 0 0 5 ρ u i n 2 where p i represents the static pressure of the cell i u i n is the incoming velocity which is 10 m s ρ is the density of the liquid p 0 is the standard atmospheric pressure fig 10 shows the distributions of c p in the three cases in several axial sections compared with the smooth wall case the low pressure magnitude caused by the tlv is larger in the groove cases at downstream positions after x c 0 1 besides the vorticity peak areas at downstream positions are reduced significantly in the groove cases as shown in fig 11 the difference is that in the vertical groove case the tlv is stronger near the leading edge as well as the induced vortex iv for the horizontal groove case the tlv is weaker in the whole evolution process therefore both types of groove show suppression effects on the tlv however the mechanisms may not be identical 4 1 effects of grooves on the tlv trajectory macroscopic characteristics of the tlv in the three cases are first analyzed the tlv trajectories in the groove cases are much closer to the suction surface as showed in figs 10 and 11 the spanwise velocity is the immediate cause of the rolling up motion of the tlv when the spanwise velocity becomes significant the leakage flow will leave the gap region further results in the formation of the tlv so the difference in tlv trajectory heights can be revealed via the continuity equation in a two dimensional plane as shown in fig 12 the continuity equation of a 2d flow is given by eq 7 in which v and w are the vertical and spanwise components of velocity respectively and δ is the gap width by integrating eq 7 we obtain eq 8 assuming that v is uniform inside the gap and the spanwise velocity on the solid wall surface w 0 is zero then we obtain eq 9 it is clear that the spanwise velocity on the tip side is approximately linearly proportional to the gap size and the vertical velocity gradient for the vertical groove case the groove configuration shares the similar effect with a local enlarged gap in addition the high intensity iv showed in fig 11 can reduce the vertical jet intensity and contribute to a large spanwise w δ for the horizontal groove case the vorticity field reveals that there are a lot of small induced vortices inside the grooves the penetration ability of the leakage jet is weakened as its adverse vertical gradient is enhanced by these induced vortices thus the formation positions of the tlv in the two groove cases are lower than the smooth case 4 2 effects of the grooves on the gap flow in this study the suppression mechanism of the grooves on the tlv is investigated from the perspective of the vortex stability theory in the earlier research on the vortex stability sarpkaya 1971a 1971b observed three types of vortex breakdown double helix spiral and bubble types the breakdown of the tlv in the smooth wall case has similarities with the spiral mode hall 1967 found that there is a streamwise adverse pressure gradient along the vortex center line and it increases with the enhancement of the vortex intensity such adverse pressure gradient is regarded as the main cause of the vortex breakdown devenport et al 1996 according to the balance between the radial pressure gradient and the centrifugal force escudier 1988 obtained eq 10 to predict the pressure gradient at the vortex center if the vortex core grows the second term on the right hand of eq 10 is always positive this manifests that the adverse pressure gradient can be generated at the vortex center even the ambient pressure gradient is negative finally leading to a reduction in the axial velocity therefore for a growing vortex a stagnant point with reversed velocity may be caused by the adverse pressure gradient at the vortex center thereafter the axial flow concentrated in the vortex core with an appreciable velocity may decelerate and diverge as if a solid obstacle was met hall 1967 10 p x r 0 p x ρ 0 γ r 3 γ r v r u x d r 11 θ t a n 1 v t u x independent studies of the vortex stability are usually carried out in cylindrical tubes to control some parameters however the tlv is rather complex since it involves the boundary layer interactions and the multiple vortex merging in addition the three components of the tlv velocity are not constant during the evolutionary process thus it is a challenging task to estimate the tlv stability through eq 10 to overcome these difficulties a local vortex parameter the swirl angle is denoted as eq 11 hall 1967 found that the maximum value of θ before the breakdown position is invariably greater than 50 other scholars have made similar findings krause 1985 suggested that the distance a vortex moves downstream stably is inversely proportional to the square of the maximum vortex tangential velocity and proportional to the square of the axial velocity using a simulation narain 1977 found that if the swirl angle increases the diffusion of the vortex will be enhanced casing the breakdown position to move upstream therefore the vortex stability is mainly related with two velocity parameters i e the tangential velocity and the axial velocity thus these two parameters are discussed respectively in following subsections 4 2 1 tangential velocity analysis the tangential velocity of the tlv under small gap conditions always shows asymmetric characteristics on account of strong interactions between the gap flow and the solid wall the tangential velocity distribution in the spanwise contains vital vortex information such as the maximum tangential velocity magnitude and the maximum vortex core radius thus the investigation of the tangential velocity of the tlv is focused in the spanwise direction as shown in fig 13 in the smooth wall case tangential velocity curves are more order on the near wall side when groove structures are applied the tlv interacts with the low speed flow inside the grooves resulting in chaotic distributions at the tip side for the vertical groove case as the section x c 0 3 cuts into a groove the tangential velocity drops steeply in the groove at z c 1 5 there is an m shaped distribution near the tip it is caused by the combined action of the tlv and the slv as the sampled line in spanwise passed through the two vortices simultaneously this phenomenon is not found in the horizontal groove case the tangential velocity peak values in the two groove cases are also different compared with the smooth wall case the tlv under the vertical groove case is hindered by the iv seriously leading to a slight reduction in the maximum tangential velocity magnitude in the horizontal groove case the maximum tangential velocity decreases significantly even the iv is weak this attributes to the difference in the leakage rate on the cross sectional plane through the foil chord in the gap region the leakage rate q l is calculated by integrating the leakage velocity on the cross sectional plane the results are shown in table 3 for the vertical groove case the leakage rate is larger as the averaged gap size is increased for the horizontal groove case the leakage jet is weakened by counter rotating vortices i e small iv inside the grooves resulting in a smaller leakage rate in small gap size conditions it can be considered that the leakage flow is basically converted into the tlv therefore the tlv can get a high intensity in the vertical groove case the iv above the tlv is correspondingly strengthened the opposite result is presented in the horizontal groove case in addition it can also be found in table 3 that when the tlv is suppressed the hydrofoil lift coefficient decreases it is consistent with the kutta joukowski theorem it implies that the suppression of the tlv may cause an adverse impact on the blade performance 4 2 2 axial velocity analysis the difference in the axial flow state between the two groove cases is significant as shown in fig 14 for the vertical groove the axial velocity in the tlv center is jet like before x c 0 0 then turns into a wake like state downstream x c 0 1 the near suction surface regions are full of high speed flow which is similar to the smooth case for the horizontal groove case the jet like axial flow state in the tlv center is less obvious a more detailed comparison of the axial velocity value in the tlv center is listed in table 4 in can be seen that the jet like axial flow state presents in the tlv center near the leading for the three cases it is consistent with lee s report that the jet like axial flow is always presents in vortex center during the vortex formation period lee and pereira 2010 the most notable difference is that the axial velocity in the tlv center under the vertical groove configuration exceeds the values in the two other cases before x c 0 0 thereafter it drops abruptly in the other two cases the axial velocity decreases smoothly qualitative investigations of the axial velocity in the tlv center can be carried out according to the formula proposed by batchelor 1964 in cylindrical coordinates the equations of motion for the steady axisymmetric flow of an incompressible fluid can be reduced to eq 12 where u x v r and v t are the axial radial and tangential velocity components respectively without considering vortex growth i e neglecting the radial velocity the relationship between the tangential velocity and the radial pressure gradient can be simplified as eq 13 by integrating it and combining with the bernoulli equation we obtain eq 14 where γ is the vortex circulation δ h denotes a function that accounts for the viscous losses along a streamline passing through the boundary layer of the surface where the effect of viscous forces is appreciable this equation shows that there are two types of effects on the axial velocity in the vortex center inviscid swirl acceleration effect and viscous dissipation effect the axial velocity will increase if the core size or viscous loss decreases and the vortex intensity increases 12 u x v r x v r v r r v t 2 r 1 ρ p r ν 2 v r v r r 2 13 v t 2 r 1 ρ p r 14 u r 0 2 u 2 2 r 1 4 π 2 r 2 γ 2 r d r 2 δ h besides the swirl motion effect and the viscus dissipation a kind of local suction blowing action exists in the groove cases therefore momentum exchange happens on the interfacial plane that between the grooves and the gap the momentum transport attributed to the grooves can be detected through an axial momentum transport rate 15 π x u z u x u i n u i n the π x along the projected line of the foil chord on the interfacial plane is sampled as shown in fig 15 considering the flow direction there are four possible combinations as listed in table 5 the symbol of and donates the direction according to the cartesian coordinate system in fig 3 the suction or blowing effect caused by the grooves is decided by the direction of u z therefore a positive π x indicates the grooves blow out the negative axial momentum in the grooves or suck in the positive axial momentum from the gap flow which weakens the axial velocity in the tlv center while negative π x means the grooves blow out the positive axial momentum in the grooves or sucking in the negative axial momentum from the gap flow which enhances the axial velocity in the tlv center it can be seen in fig 15 that the sampled π x in the vertical groove case is almost negative denoting that the grooves especially the ones near the leading edge of the hydrofoil have a significantly reinforcement effect on the axial momentum of the tlv the similar effect exists in the horizontal groove case with less intense which can be neglected to clarify the situation uniformly spaced sampling lines in the pitchwise on the interfacial plane are selected and marked as λ as shown in fig 16 π x is integrated on the sampled lines it is clear in fig 16 that beneath the hydrofoil the integrated π x is positive then turns into negative in the gap it suggests that the fluid inside the gap is sucked into the grooves beneath the pressure surface and then blew out at a higher position for the vertical groove case the slv showed in fig 9 is formed owing to the shear flow inside the gap thereafter it is absorbed into the leakage flow via the blowing effect as the axial velocity in the center of a vortex must be positive if the vortex is stable the slv is an important momentum carrier variation laws of vortex intensity after the merging of two co rotor vortices were studied by dritschel et al dritschel and waugh 1992 who found that the merged vortex is invariably stronger than previous individuals folz et al folz and nomura 2017 also pointed out that the vortex after merging is about 1 01 1 60 times stronger than the previous ones these results are consistent with the significant increases of the tlv intensity and the axial velocity in the tlv center for the vertical groove case thus it can be confirmed that both the intensity and axial velocity of the tlv are enhanced extremely through the merging of the tlv and slv at upstream positions in the vertical groove case however for the horizontal groove case such compensation effect is almost absent regarding the viscous dissipation caused by the interaction between the tlv and the iv or the boundary layer it can be detected through the dissipation term from the energy equation of a steady incompressible flow as shown in eq 16 in which ν e f f ν ν t is the effective viscosity the results are shown in fig 17 there are clear dissipation distributions around the tip and inside the grooves in the both cases for the vertical groove the dissipation merely concentrates at upstream positions however it is more serious in the horizontal groove case as it covered the regions that the leakage jet and the tlv passing by so far the causes of axial flow states in the tlv center can be revealed for the vertical groove case the slv directly enhances the tlv intensity and the axial momentum simultaneously before x c 0 1 this caused the jet like axial flow state at the upstream positions however the compensation action ceases abruptly making the flow state turn into a wake like state for the horizontal groove case the acceleration effect caused by the swirl motion on the axial velocity in the tlv center is weak due to the low vortex intensity together with a stronger viscous dissipation resulting in a smaller axial velocity value in the tlv center 16 φ ν e f f u i x j ν e f f 2 u i x j u j x i 2 4 2 3 stability analysis finally the swirl angle in the three cases are obtained as shown in fig 18 for the vertical groove case the swirl angle maintains small before x c 0 0 as the axial momentum is resupplied via the slv this supplement disappeared subsequently however the enhancement on the tlv intensity the tsv has made is still exist giving rise to a steep increase on the swirl angle downstream x c 0 1 the tlv becomes unstably rapidly at this position and breaks down for the horizontal groove case the momentum exchange between the grooves and the gap flow is barely exist the dissipation effect dominates in the whole evolution process resulting in a more stable but weaker tlv than the other two cases 5 conclusion and discussion in this study two types of most commonly used casing grooves are distinguished i e the vertical groove and the horizontal groove based on their slot directions behaviors of the tlv and the gap flow under different solid wall conditions are numerically investigated the k ω sst iddes turbulence model is selected to solve the flow field which is helpful in providing accurate numerical results both the two types of grooves show suppression effects on the tlv and also bring the tlv trajectory close to the suction surface owing to the enlarged local gap size or the large adverse vertical velocity gradient this phenomenon implies that tlv cavitation bubbles may collapse near the blade suction surface there are strong shear flows inside the vertical grooves giving birth to a type of secondary leakage vortex slv near the leading edge in addition the local suction blowing effect is strong in the vertical groove case near the leading edge it leads to the merging of the tlv and the slv further enhances the tlv intensity and the axial velocity in the tlv center for the horizontal groove case such local suction blowing effect is almost absent on the contrary the viscous dissipation effect is more stronger than that in the vertical groove case resulting in a low intensity tlv from the perspective of the vortex stability theory the suppression mechanism of the two casing groove methods on the tlv is different for the vertical groove the momentum exchange is the main factor it increases the tlv intensity at upstream positions and then shuts down the axial momentum supply at a downstream position makes the tlv loss its stability thus it seems like the tlv is cut off however this method may against to the purpose to improve the anti cavitation ability in hydraulic machinery as the breakdown of a high intensity vortex may lead to a fierce cavitation erosion moreover the collapse positions of the tlv cavitation bubbles are probably very close to the foil surface in contrast the suppression effect on the tlv of the horizontal groove is mainly generated via the viscous
