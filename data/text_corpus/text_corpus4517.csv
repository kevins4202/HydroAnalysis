structure interaction morison equation structure diameter water depth action frequency action amplitude 1 introduction more and more coastal and offshore engineering structures such as cross sea bridges wharfs offshore oil platforms and wind power towers are being constructed in deep water among them the structures that are located in the earthquake region may be subjected to strong earthquakes and the fluid structure interaction fsi effect should be considered the mechanism of the dynamic interaction between fluid and structure is not clear yet and dynamic analysis to predict the influence of the fsi on the structures are complicated the morison equation morison et al 1950 penzien and kaul 1972 boccotti et al 2013 niewiarowski et al 2018 and radiation wave theory wepf et al 1988 chopra and goyal 1991 avilés and li 2001 wang et al 2018 are the two main methods to calculate the hydrodynamic pressure arising from the fsi due to the simplicity and practicability the morison equation has been widely used in many researches morison et al 1950 first proposed the morison equation a semi empirical formula to calculate the wave force of small diameter cylinder based on the assumption that the cylinder has no effect on the movement of wave the wave force consists of a drag force and an inertial force as shown in the morison equation penzien and kaul 1972 subsequently developed the morison equation to calculate the hydrodynamic pressure of small diameter cylinder under earthquakes and analyzed the dynamic response of four representative deep water towers under strong earthquakes using the stochastic method and response spectrum method yang and li 2013 presented an expanded morison equation to calculate the hydrodynamic pressure induced by inner water of hollow columns under earthquakes the hydrodynamic force of inner water was expressed in the form of inertial force caused by the inner water added mass li and yang 2013 modified and simplified the expressions of hydrodynamic pressure for cylindrical hollow piers caused by outer water and inner water martinelli et al 2011 studied the dynamic performance of submerged floating tunnels under earthquakes considering the spatial variability effect of the excitation and the fluid structure interaction and the hydrodynamic pressure was calculated by the morison equation li et al 2010 analyzed the influence of hydrodynamic pressure on the response of the large group piles foundation of the yangtze river road bridge based on the morison equation the results showed that hydrodynamic pressure effect changed the seismic responses characteristics of the group piles foundation and had impact on the acceleration displacement and inner force of the pile the previous researches show that the fsi should be considered for underwater structures under earthquakes and the morison equation is the main method used to calculate the hydrodynamic pressure due to fsi the key step for calculating the hydrodynamic pressure using the morison equation is to choose reasonable inertial and drag coefficients keulegan and carpenter 1958 demonstrated that there were many factors affecting the inertial and drag coefficients among which the reynolds number keulegan carpenter number and relative roughness of structure surface were the three major factors cotter and chakrabarti 1984 performed a wave tank test on fixed vertical and inclined cylinders and the hydrodynamic coefficients were computed based on the measured local forces on the cylinder the test results indicated that the inertial and drag coefficients could be expressed as the functions of keulegan carpenter number vengatesan et al 2000 conducted experiments to study the hydrodynamic coefficients for a vertical truncated rectangular cylinder due to regular and random waves the results showed the drag and inertia coefficients were strongly affected by the variation in the aspect ratios of the cylinder yuan and huang 2010 investigated the in line force on a small segment of a vertical circular cylinder of various truncated lengths in regular waves and the inertia and drag coefficients were presented as a function of keulegan carpenter number konstantinidis and bouris 2017 studied the drag and inertia coefficients for a circular cylinder in steady plus low amplitude oscillatory flows through simulations and the coefficients in morison equation were determined by the least squares method raed and soares 2018 examined the variability effect of the drag and inertia coefficients on the morison wave force acting on a fixed vertical cylinder in irregular waves it is worth noting that the inertial and drag coefficients in the aforementioned studies are studied at the condition of wave action and the coefficients in the morison equation for earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure are seldom studied as the wave action and earthquake action are two different conditions directly applying the coefficients obtained under the wave action to the calculations under the earthquake action may lead to an improper conclusion especially the morison equation is proposed on the assumption that the cylinder has no effect on the water around while the earthquake can induce significant dynamic pressures from the vibration of structure in water therefore it s necessary to investigate the inertial and drag coefficients under earthquake action in this study a series of dynamic tests on circle steel tubes with different dimensions in a water tank were conducted the hydrodynamic added mass for tubes with different diameters water depths and input action frequencies and amplitudes was examined the inertial coefficient in the morison equation was then determined a formula fitted to the test results was proposed and verified to calculate the inertial coefficient under sinusoidal ground motions as the real earthquake could not be described by a specific frequency of sinusoidal motion a method to calculate the hydrodynamic added mass under the real earthquake was proposed finally a series of underwater shaking table tests were conducted to validate the test data and the method mentioned above the results of this study can provide a reference for the application of the morison equation in calculating the earthquake induced hydrodynamic added mass 2 test system the test was conducted at servotest testing systems ltd in beijing china as shown in fig 1 the test system consists of a water tank and a horizontal actuator below it the water tank has a dimension of 5 2 5 2 1 2 m a shaking table with the diameter of 0 9 m is connected to the center of the bottom of the water tank using waterproof cloth the shaking table is supported by a steel frame through two paralleled guideways which are in line with the horizontal actuator the steel frame is fixed on the ground and is rigid enough to keep still during the test the load capacity of the actuator is 25 kn the maximum displacement is 75 mm and the frequency range is 0 1 100 hz it can be seen from fig 1 b that the actuator is fixed on the steel pedestal which is still during the test 3 test conditions morison equation shows that the earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure depends on water depth diameter and acceleration of the pier and inertial coefficient many studies indicate that the inertial coefficient is the function of keulegan carpenter number which is related to speed and period of wave therefore in order to comprehensively analyze the hydrodynamic added mass and inertial coefficient a series of tests on circle steel tubes with different dimensions water depths and input action frequencies and amplitudes were conducted fig 2 shows the overview and installation of specimens four different specifications which are numbered as specimen a b c and d are adopted with the outer diameter of 101 150 324 and 610 mm respectively and the corresponding wall thickness are 10 10 12 5 and 16 mm respectively the height of all the tubes is 1 2 m the specimens are welded to steel plates to connected to the shaking table with bolts as shown in fig 2 b three water levels are considered in the tests i e 0 2 0 5 and 0 8 m to study the changing rule of the hydrodynamic added mass and inertial coefficient according to the input action frequency and amplitude sinusoidal ground motions are adopted the frequency and amplitude of the sinusoidal motions in the test are listed in table 1 4 test data acquisition acceleration and hydrodynamic pressure along the height of specimen were recorded in the test the acceleration transducers have a waterproof structure and can be installed in water to achieve underwater measurement the hydrodynamic pressure is measured by the point pressure transducer fig 3 shows the layout of measuring instruments along the specimen there are 11 acceleration transducers and 11 point pressure transducers as the acceleration and hydrodynamic pressure at the downstream face is the same as that at the same height of the downstream face the acceleration transducers and point pressure transducers are installed at the downstream face and upstream face of the tube respectively the two types of transducers are located at every 80 mm from the bottom of the specimen 5 test results and analysis the changing rules of the total hydrodynamic added mass according to the diameter of the specimen water depth and input action frequency and amplitude were investigated respectively the morison equation is introduced to compare with the test results the hydrodynamic pressure per unit height on a cylinder under earthquake action can be expressed by the modified morison equation li et al 2018 as shown in eq 1 1 p π 4 ρ c m 1 d 2 x 0 1 2 c d ρ d 8 π σ x 0 x 0 where ρ is water density c m and c d are the inertial and drag coefficients d is the diameter of the cylinder ẋ 0 and ẍ 0 are the absolute velocity and associated acceleration of the structure and σ ẋ0 is the standard deviation of ẋ 0 the first term at the right of eq 1 denotes the inertial force and the second term denotes the drag force for costal and offshore engineering structures the influence of hydrodynamic added drag force on the dynamic response of structures is very small and negligible compared to the hydrodynamic added inertial force goto and toki 1965 song et al 2013 therefore the morison equation can be simplified without the term of drag force as shown in eq 2 2 p π 4 c m ρ d 2 x 0 where c m c m 1 denotes the modified inertial coefficient normally c m is assumed to be a constant of 1 0 for cylindrical structures penzien and kaul 1972 the total hydrodynamic added mass on the cylinder under earthquake action can be expressed as shown in eq 3 3 m π 4 c m ρ h d 2 where h is the water depth as shown in eq 3 the hydrodynamic added mass is proportional to h and d 2 and independent of the action frequency and amplitude as for the test results the total hydrodynamic added mass of the tube under different conditions is the sum of hydrodynamic added mass of each point along the height of the tube 4 m 0 5 m 1 i 2 10 m i 0 5 m 11 d l where d is the specimen diameter l is the distance between two measuring points 0 08 m as shown in fig 3 and m i is the hydrodynamic added mass of measuring point i as indicated by eq 4 m i can be expressed as the ratio between the hydrodynamic pressure and the corresponding acceleration 5 m i p i a i where m i p i and a i are the hydrodynamic added mass hydrodynamic pressure and acceleration of the measuring point respectively 5 1 results for specimens with different action amplitudes figs 4 and 5 show the hydrodynamic added mass and the inertial coefficient under different action amplitudes the water depth was 0 5 m the specimen diameter d was 101 mm for figs 4 a and 5 a and 324 mm for figs 4 b and 5 b note that the results of other conditions had similar behavior with the results listed here the inertial coefficient is calculated by combining eqs 3 and 4 6 c m m 1 4 π d 2 h ρ as the inertial coefficient is dimensionless the action amplitude a diameter of specimen d and water depth h are nondimensionalized by a g d h and h h to present the relationship between them and the inertial coefficient where g is the gravitational acceleration and h is the specimen height the two figures show that the inertial coefficient has the same changing rule with the hydrodynamic added mass take the hydrodynamic added mass as example it can be seen from fig 4 that the added mass changed little with the increase of action amplitude for all the curves in fig 4 the change of added mass was less than 10 as the action amplitudes increasing from 0 1 g to 1 5 g therefore the action amplitude change can be ignored when calculating the added mass as shown by the morison equation in eq 3 the action amplitude has no effect on the added mass which matches with the test results 5 2 results for specimens with different action frequencies figs 6 and 7 show the hydrodynamic added mass and the inertial coefficient under different action frequencies the water depth was 0 5 m the specimen diameter d was 101 mm for figs 6 a and 7 a and 324 mm for figs 6 b and 7 b the two figures show that the inertial coefficient has the same changing rule with the hydrodynamic added mass take the hydrodynamic added mass as example it can be seen from fig 6 that the added mass decreased when the action frequency was less than 15 hz and increased when the action frequency was more than 15 hz the added mass decreased up to 38 5 from f 4 hz 15 hz and increased up to 77 from f 15 hz 40 hz however the morison equation indicates that the added mass is independent of action frequency as shown in eq 3 which is different from the test results for instance as shown in fig 6 b the minimum added mass was 8 58 kg when f 15 hz and the maximum added mass was 13 6 kg when f 40 hz which increased by 58 5 this may be attributed to the compressibility of water which is neglected in the morison equation according to the radiation wave theory there is an effect on the hydrodynamic pressure on pier when considering the compressibility of water therefore the action frequency should be considered in calculating the added mass 5 3 results for specimens with different diameters figs 8 and 9 show the hydrodynamic added mass and the inertial coefficient for specimens with different diameters the water depth was 0 5 m the action frequency f was 4 for figs 8 a and 9 a and 25 hz for figs 8 b and 9 b it can be seen from fig 8 that the added mass obviously increased with the increase of the specimen diameter and there was little difference between curves of different action amplitudes the slope of the curve also increases which indicates that the value of added mass increased faster than the value of specimen diameter did fig 9 indicates that the inertial coefficient generally decreased with specimen diameter therefore the added mass was proportional to d a 1 0 a 2 0 according to eq 6 however the morison equation indicates that the added mass is proportional to the square of diameter as shown in eq 3 to investigate the relationship of added mass and specimen diameter table 2 shows the ratios of square of diameter and added mass between specimen b c d and specimen a as the added mass changed little with action amplitudes the ratio of added mass in table 2 was the mean value of different action amplitudes for example the ratio of added mass at f 4 hz between specimen b and a was 2 31 which was the mean value of the six ratios of action amplitudes a 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 7 1 0 and 1 5 g as shown in table 2 the added mass increased by up to 28 times when the diameter increased from 101 mm to 610 mm the ratios of added mass and square of diameter were not the same in most cases although they should be the same as indicated by eq 3 the reason may be that the influence of pier on the flowing of water is neglected in the morison equation while the hydrodynamic pressure under earthquake is caused by the moving of pier for specimens b and a the two ratios had little difference and the maximum difference between them was 13 2 for specimens c and a the ratio of square of diameter could be 23 9 more than the ratio of added mass for specimens d and a the difference between the two ratios was obviously large and the ratio of square of diameter could be 70 9 more than the ratio of added mass as a summary the difference between the two ratios became larger when the diameter of specimen increased which means that the influence of the specimen on the flowing of water increased the test results do not agree with the morison equation and the added mass is not proportional to the square of diameter 5 4 results for specimens with different water depths figs 10 and 11 show the hydrodynamic added mass and the inertial coefficient under different water depths the action amplitude was 0 4 g the specimen diameter d was 101 mm for figs 10 a and 11 a and 324 mm for figs 10 b and 11 b fig 10 shows that the changing of the hydrodynamic added mass with water depth under different action frequencies it can be seen from the two subplots that the added mass significantly increased with water depth fig 11 indicates that the inertial coefficient generally increased with water depth therefore the added mass was proportional to h b b 1 0 according to eq 6 however the morison equation indicates that the added mass is proportional to the water depth as shown in eq 3 to investigate the relationship of added mass and water depth table 3 shows the water depth ratio and added mass ratio between the test conditions at water depth of 0 5 m and 0 8 m and that of 0 2 m as the added mass changed little with action amplitudes the ratio of added mass in the table was the mean value of different action amplitudes as shown in table 3 the added mass increased by 14 times when the water depth increased from 0 2 m to 0 8 m by 4 times the value of added mass ratio was obviously larger that of water depth ratio in most cases which should be the same as indicated by eq 3 the same reason is stated in section 5 3 the difference between the two ratios under various conditions was beyond 20 and the maximum was 261 therefore the test results do not agree with the morison equation and the added mass is not proportional to water depth 5 5 the inertial coefficient as discussed in above sections the test results do not agree with the morison equation as shown in eq 3 for the rule of added mass changing with action frequency specimen diameter and water depth based on eq 3 the inertial coefficient c m is considered as the function of action frequency specimen diameter and water depth table 4 shows the value of inertial coefficient under different conditions for the four specimens note that the value of inertial coefficient under each condition was the mean value of inertial coefficient under different action amplitudes as the action amplitude had only slight effect on the added mass two dimensionless parameters are introduced in the table one is the ratio of the water depth and the height of the specimen h h and the other is the ratio of the diameter and height of the specimen d h the two parameters are proposed for fitting a formula of inertial coefficient described below which can be applied to real cylinders in costal and offshore engineering structures it can be concluded from table 4 that the range of inertial coefficient under different conditions was from 0 047 to 0 399 for different cylinders which varied greatly from the constant of 1 0 adopted by previous researches for the inertial coefficients of different water depths it increased with water depth for most conditions such as condition 1 21 and 41 or condition 11 31 and 51 condition 58 achieved the maximum increase by 262 over condition 18 when water depth changed from 0 2 m to 0 8 m for the inertial coefficients of different diameters it decreased with diameter for most conditions such as condition 3 8 13 and 18 or condition 25 30 35 and 40 condition 18 achieved the maximum decrease by 78 over condition 3 when diameter changed from 101 mm to 610 mm for the inertial coefficients of different action frequencies it first decreased and then increased with the action frequency increasing for most conditions such as condition 6 7 8 9 and 10 or condition 41 42 43 44 and 45 condition 18 achieved the maximum decrease by 60 over condition 16 when action frequency changed from 4 to 15 hz and condition 20 achieved the maximum increase by 183 over condition 18 when action frequency changed from 15 to 40 hz in general the inertial coefficient was relatively larger with deeper water and smaller diameter in order to apply the conclusion above to more conditions especially the real structures a fitting formula of the inertial coefficient was proposed according to table 4 the results of conditions 11 21 26 31 36 and 51 55 in table 4 were not used in the fitting where conditions 11 31 and 51 represented conditions of different water depths conditions 21 26 31 and 36 represented conditions of different water diameters of pier and conditions 51 55 represented conditions of different water action frequencies they were kept for the verification of the fitting formula the formula was as shown in eq 7 7 c m a 1 f 3 a 2 f 2 m a 3 f 2 n a 4 f 2 a 5 m 2 a 6 n 2 a 7 m n a 8 f n a 9 m a 10 n a 11 f a 12 where f is the action frequency m h h n d h and a 1 a 11 are constants a 1 1 32 10 5 s3 a 2 1 26 10 4 s2 a 3 6 42 10 4 s2 a 4 1 31 10 3 s2 a 5 5 51 10 1 a 6 2 80 10 1 a 7 3 08 10 1 a 8 2 52 10 2 a 9 6 29 10 1 a 10 7 18 10 1 a 11 3 10 10 2 s a 12 3 40 10 1 and a 11 3 58 10 1 the maximum power of each parameter in eq 7 was determined according to the changing rule of added mass with different factors as investigated in previous sections for instance the maximum power of action frequency was 3 to describe the rule that the added mass first decreased and then increased with action frequency note that the formula was valid when 4 f 40 0 167 m 0 667 and 0 084 n 0 508 and the correctness of the parameter out of the range remained uncertain fig 12 shows the values of c m predicted by eq 7 comparing with that in table 4 it can be observed from the figures that the inertial coefficient calculated by the proposed formula matched well with test data under different conditions and the maximum relative error was less than 10 substituting eq 7 into eq 3 the morison equation can precisely predict the hydrodynamic added mass of a cylindrical structures under earthquakes 5 6 calculation for the real earthquake as the formula of the inertial coefficient was obtained based on sinusoidal ground motions it cannot be directly used to calculate the hydrodynamic added mass under the real earthquake because the real earthquake is a signal of narrow bandwidth and it is difficult to describe it by a specific value of frequency therefore a method to calculate the hydrodynamic added mass under the real earthquake is proposed the hydrodynamic added mass under the real earthquake is calculated by the weighted average of hydrodynamic added mass under several sinusoidal ground motions as shown in eq 8 8 m i 1 n η i m i where η i is the weighting coefficient m i is the hydrodynamic added mass under the sinusoidal ground motion with the frequency at which the amplitude of the power spectrum of the earthquake wave is relatively large and n is the number of the points chosen in the power spectrum the points used for calculation in eq 8 are selected based on the following equation 9 a i a m a x 0 3 where a i is the amplitude of the chosen point and a max is the maximum amplitude in the power spectrum the hydrodynamic added mass of the pier under the real earthquake can be calculated by combining eqs 3 and 8 6 underwater shaking table tests validation 6 1 test introduction to validate the proposed formulas and the method for calculating the hydrodynamic added mass under the real earthquake proposed in section 5 a series of underwater shaking table tests were conducted the test equipment is the world s first underwater dual shaking tables test system which was newly built in tianjin university tianjin china as shown in fig 13 the diameters of the two shaking tables are 3 6 m and the load capacity of each table is 20 0 ton without water and 12 0 ton with water the maximum accelerations are 1 5 g in x and y directions and 1 2 g in z direction the two shaking tables are installed in a water pool with a size of 24 8 m 12 5 m 3 m length width depth and the maximum depth of water in experiment is 2 0 m two groups of rocker flap wave makers are installed on one long side of the pool and the adjacent short side to generate waves in two directions the specimens are two circle steel tubes with diameters of 101 mm specimen d and 351 mm specimen e and the height is 1 4 m the water depth is 0 6 m in the test fig 14 shows the specimen e without and with water respectively the sinusoidal ground motions and earthquake waves are adopted in the tests the frequencies and amplitudes of the sinusoidal motions are the same as that listed in table 1 the earthquake waves are el centro 1940 taft 1952 and tianjin 1976 and the acceleration amplitudes are 0 2 g 6 2 test results and analysis fig 15 shows the hydrodynamic added mass of specimens d and e under sinusoidal motions with different action frequencies where the black point represents the test results and the solid line represents the results calculated by eq 3 it can be observed from fig 15 that the hydrodynamic added mass calculated by eq 3 matched well with the test results under different conditions and the maximum relative error was less than 10 table 5 gives the hydrodynamic added mass calculated by eq 8 and test results under different earthquake waves as indicated by table 5 the value of the added mass calculated by eq 8 was very closed to that of test results and the maximum relative error was 14 1 therefore the formulas and the method proposed in section 5 were verified to be able to calculate the hydrodynamic added mass of pier under real earthquake 7 conclusions to investigate the hydrodynamic added mass and the inertial coefficient in the morison equation for earthquake induced hydrodynamic added mass a dynamic test system with a water tank and an actuator was put up to perform a series of dynamic tests on four cylindrical steel tubes the variety of tube diameter water depth action frequency action amplitude was considered in the tests the major conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the test results didn t agree with morison equation for earthquake induced hydrodynamic added mass in the changing rules of added mass with action frequency specimen diameter and water depth 2 the hydrodynamic added mass increased with structure diameter and water depth the added mass could increase by 28 times when the diameter increased from 101 mm to 610 mm while the added mass increased by 14 times when the water depth increased from 0 2 m to 0 8 m 3 the hydrodynamic added mass first decreased and then increased with the action frequency increasing and changed little with the action amplitude the added mass could decrease 38 5 with action frequency increasing from 4 to 15 hz and could increase 77 with action frequency increasing from 15 to 40 hz 4 the inertial coefficient was relatively larger with deeper water and smaller diameter and it first decreased and then increased with the increase of action frequency 5 the proposed formula and method matched well with the results of underwater shaking table tests and they can be used to calculate the hydrodynamic added mass of cylindrical structures under earthquake action the conclusions obtained in this study mainly apply to cylinders and the proposed formulas are valid where the values of relate parameters are of the range in this study acknowledgment the authors gratefully acknowledge the support for this research from the national

different specifications which are numbered as specimen a b c and d are adopted with the outer diameter of 101 150 324 and 610 mm respectively and the corresponding wall thickness are 10 10 12 5 and 16 mm respectively the height of all the tubes is 1 2 m the specimens are welded to steel plates to connected to the shaking table with bolts as shown in fig 2 b three water levels are considered in the tests i e 0 2 0 5 and 0 8 m to study the changing rule of the hydrodynamic added mass and inertial coefficient according to the input action frequency and amplitude sinusoidal ground motions are adopted the frequency and amplitude of the sinusoidal motions in the test are listed in table 1 4 test data acquisition acceleration and hydrodynamic pressure along the height of specimen were recorded in the test the acceleration transducers have a waterproof structure and can be installed in water to achieve underwater measurement the hydrodynamic pressure is measured by the point pressure transducer fig 3 shows the layout of measuring instruments along the specimen there are 11 acceleration transducers and 11 point pressure transducers as the acceleration and hydrodynamic pressure at the downstream face is the same as that at the same height of the downstream face the acceleration transducers and point pressure transducers are installed at the downstream face and upstream face of the tube respectively the two types of transducers are located at every 80 mm from the bottom of the specimen 5 test results and analysis the changing rules of the total hydrodynamic added mass according to the diameter of the specimen water depth and input action frequency and amplitude were investigated respectively the morison equation is introduced to compare with the test results the hydrodynamic pressure per unit height on a cylinder under earthquake action can be expressed by the modified morison equation li et al 2018 as shown in eq 1 1 p π 4 ρ c m 1 d 2 x 0 1 2 c d ρ d 8 π σ x 0 x 0 where ρ is water density c m and c d are the inertial and drag coefficients d is the diameter of the cylinder ẋ 0 and ẍ 0 are the absolute velocity and associated acceleration of the structure and σ ẋ0 is the standard deviation of ẋ 0 the first term at the right of eq 1 denotes the inertial force and the second term denotes the drag force for costal and offshore engineering structures the influence of hydrodynamic added drag force on the dynamic response of structures is very small and negligible compared to the hydrodynamic added inertial force goto and toki 1965 song et al 2013 therefore the morison equation can be simplified without the term of drag force as shown in eq 2 2 p π 4 c m ρ d 2 x 0 where c m c m 1 denotes the modified inertial coefficient normally c m is assumed to be a constant of 1 0 for cylindrical structures penzien and kaul 1972 the total hydrodynamic added mass on the cylinder under earthquake action can be expressed as shown in eq 3 3 m π 4 c m ρ h d 2 where h is the water depth as shown in eq 3 the hydrodynamic added mass is proportional to h and d 2 and independent of the action frequency and amplitude as for the test results the total hydrodynamic added mass of the tube under different conditions is the sum of hydrodynamic added mass of each point along the height of the tube 4 m 0 5 m 1 i 2 10 m i 0 5 m 11 d l where d is the specimen diameter l is the distance between two measuring points 0 08 m as shown in fig 3 and m i is the hydrodynamic added mass of measuring point i as indicated by eq 4 m i can be expressed as the ratio between the hydrodynamic pressure and the corresponding acceleration 5 m i p i a i where m i p i and a i are the hydrodynamic added mass hydrodynamic pressure and acceleration of the measuring point respectively 5 1 results for specimens with different action amplitudes figs 4 and 5 show the hydrodynamic added mass and the inertial coefficient under different action amplitudes the water depth was 0 5 m the specimen diameter d was 101 mm for figs 4 a and 5 a and 324 mm for figs 4 b and 5 b note that the results of other conditions had similar behavior with the results listed here the inertial coefficient is calculated by combining eqs 3 and 4 6 c m m 1 4 π d 2 h ρ as the inertial coefficient is dimensionless the action amplitude a diameter of specimen d and water depth h are nondimensionalized by a g d h and h h to present the relationship between them and the inertial coefficient where g is the gravitational acceleration and h is the specimen height the two figures show that the inertial coefficient has the same changing rule with the hydrodynamic added mass take the hydrodynamic added mass as example it can be seen from fig 4 that the added mass changed little with the increase of action amplitude for all the curves in fig 4 the change of added mass was less than 10 as the action amplitudes increasing from 0 1 g to 1 5 g therefore the action amplitude change can be ignored when calculating the added mass as shown by the morison equation in eq 3 the action amplitude has no effect on the added mass which matches with the test results 5 2 results for specimens with different action frequencies figs 6 and 7 show the hydrodynamic added mass and the inertial coefficient under different action frequencies the water depth was 0 5 m the specimen diameter d was 101 mm for figs 6 a and 7 a and 324 mm for figs 6 b and 7 b the two figures show that the inertial coefficient has the same changing rule with the hydrodynamic added mass take the hydrodynamic added mass as example it can be seen from fig 6 that the added mass decreased when the action frequency was less than 15 hz and increased when the action frequency was more than 15 hz the added mass decreased up to 38 5 from f 4 hz 15 hz and increased up to 77 from f 15 hz 40 hz however the morison equation indicates that the added mass is independent of action frequency as shown in eq 3 which is different from the test results for instance as shown in fig 6 b the minimum added mass was 8 58 kg when f 15 hz and the maximum added mass was 13 6 kg when f 40 hz which increased by 58 5 this may be attributed to the compressibility of water which is neglected in the morison equation according to the radiation wave theory there is an effect on the hydrodynamic pressure on pier when considering the compressibility of water therefore the action frequency should be considered in calculating the added mass 5 3 results for specimens with different diameters figs 8 and 9 show the hydrodynamic added mass and the inertial coefficient for specimens with different diameters the water depth was 0 5 m the action frequency f was 4 for figs 8 a and 9 a and 25 hz for figs 8 b and 9 b it can be seen from fig 8 that the added mass obviously increased with the increase of the specimen diameter and there was little difference between curves of different action amplitudes the slope of the curve also increases which indicates that the value of added mass increased faster than the value of specimen diameter did fig 9 indicates that the inertial coefficient generally decreased with specimen diameter therefore the added mass was proportional to d a 1 0 a 2 0 according to eq 6 however the morison equation indicates that the added mass is proportional to the square of diameter as shown in eq 3 to investigate the relationship of added mass and specimen diameter table 2 shows the ratios of square of diameter and added mass between specimen b c d and specimen a as the added mass changed little with action amplitudes the ratio of added mass in table 2 was the mean value of different action amplitudes for example the ratio of added mass at f 4 hz between specimen b and a was 2 31 which was the mean value of the six ratios of action amplitudes a 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 7 1 0 and 1 5 g as shown in table 2 the added mass increased by up to 28 times when the diameter increased from 101 mm to 610 mm the ratios of added mass and square of diameter were not the same in most cases although they should be the same as indicated by eq 3 the reason may be that the influence of pier on the flowing of water is neglected in the morison equation while the hydrodynamic pressure under earthquake is caused by the moving of pier for specimens b and a the two ratios had little difference and the maximum difference between them was 13 2 for specimens c and a the ratio of square of diameter could be 23 9 more than the ratio of added mass for specimens d and a the difference between the two ratios was obviously large and the ratio of square of diameter could be 70 9 more than the ratio of added mass as a summary the difference between the two ratios became larger when the diameter of specimen increased which means that the influence of the specimen on the flowing of water increased the test results do not agree with the morison equation and the added mass is not proportional to the square of diameter 5 4 results for specimens with different water depths figs 10 and 11 show the hydrodynamic added mass and the inertial coefficient under different water depths the action amplitude was 0 4 g the specimen diameter d was 101 mm for figs 10 a and 11 a and 324 mm for figs 10 b and 11 b fig 10 shows that the changing of the hydrodynamic added mass with water depth under different action frequencies it can be seen from the two subplots that the added mass significantly increased with water depth fig 11 indicates that the inertial coefficient generally increased with water depth therefore the added mass was proportional to h b b 1 0 according to eq 6 however the morison equation indicates that the added mass is proportional to the water depth as shown in eq 3 to investigate the relationship of added mass and water depth table 3 shows the water depth ratio and added mass ratio between the test conditions at water depth of 0 5 m and 0 8 m and that of 0 2 m as the added mass changed little with action amplitudes the ratio of added mass in the table was the mean value of different action amplitudes as shown in table 3 the added mass increased by 14 times when the water depth increased from 0 2 m to 0 8 m by 4 times the value of added mass ratio was obviously larger that of water depth ratio in most cases which should be the same as indicated by eq 3 the same reason is stated in section 5 3 the difference between the two ratios under various conditions was beyond 20 and the maximum was 261 therefore the test results do not agree with the morison equation and the added mass is not proportional to water depth 5 5 the inertial coefficient as discussed in above sections the test results do not agree with the morison equation as shown in eq 3 for the rule of added mass changing with action frequency specimen diameter and water depth based on eq 3 the inertial coefficient c m is considered as the function of action frequency specimen diameter and water depth table 4 shows the value of inertial coefficient under different conditions for the four specimens note that the value of inertial coefficient under each condition was the mean value of inertial coefficient under different action amplitudes as the action amplitude had only slight effect on the added mass two dimensionless parameters are introduced in the table one is the ratio of the water depth and the height of the specimen h h and the other is the ratio of the diameter and height of the specimen d h the two parameters are proposed for fitting a formula of inertial coefficient described below which can be applied to real cylinders in costal and offshore engineering structures it can be concluded from table 4 that the range of inertial coefficient under different conditions was from 0 047 to 0 399 for different cylinders which varied greatly from the constant of 1 0 adopted by previous researches for the inertial coefficients of different water depths it increased with water depth for most conditions such as condition 1 21 and 41 or condition 11 31 and 51 condition 58 achieved the maximum increase by 262 over condition 18 when water depth changed from 0 2 m to 0 8 m for the inertial coefficients of different diameters it decreased with diameter for most conditions such as condition 3 8 13 and 18 or condition 25 30 35 and 40 condition 18 achieved the maximum decrease by 78 over condition 3 when diameter changed from 101 mm to 610 mm for the inertial coefficients of different action frequencies it first decreased and then increased with the action frequency increasing for most conditions such as condition 6 7 8 9 and 10 or condition 41 42 43 44 and 45 condition 18 achieved the maximum decrease by 60 over condition 16 when action frequency changed from 4 to 15 hz and condition 20 achieved the maximum increase by 183 over condition 18 when action frequency changed from 15 to 40 hz in general the inertial coefficient was relatively larger with deeper water and smaller diameter in order to apply the conclusion above to more conditions especially the real structures a fitting formula of the inertial coefficient was proposed according to table 4 the results of conditions 11 21 26 31 36 and 51 55 in table 4 were not used in the fitting where conditions 11 31 and 51 represented conditions of different water depths conditions 21 26 31 and 36 represented conditions of different water diameters of pier and conditions 51 55 represented conditions of different water action frequencies they were kept for the verification of the fitting formula the formula was as shown in eq 7 7 c m a 1 f 3 a 2 f 2 m a 3 f 2 n a 4 f 2 a 5 m 2 a 6 n 2 a 7 m n a 8 f n a 9 m a 10 n a 11 f a 12 where f is the action frequency m h h n d h and a 1 a 11 are constants a 1 1 32 10 5 s3 a 2 1 26 10 4 s2 a 3 6 42 10 4 s2 a 4 1 31 10 3 s2 a 5 5 51 10 1 a 6 2 80 10 1 a 7 3 08 10 1 a 8 2 52 10 2 a 9 6 29 10 1 a 10 7 18 10 1 a 11 3 10 10 2 s a 12 3 40 10 1 and a 11 3 58 10 1 the maximum power of each parameter in eq 7 was determined according to the changing rule of added mass with different factors as investigated in previous sections for instance the maximum power of action frequency was 3 to describe the rule that the added mass first decreased and then increased with action frequency note that the formula was valid when 4 f 40 0 167 m 0 667 and 0 084 n 0 508 and the correctness of the parameter out of the range remained uncertain fig 12 shows the values of c m predicted by eq 7 comparing with that in table 4 it can be observed from the figures that the inertial coefficient calculated by the proposed formula matched well with test data under different conditions and the maximum relative error was less than 10 substituting eq 7 into eq 3 the morison equation can precisely predict the hydrodynamic added mass of a cylindrical structures under earthquakes 5 6 calculation for the real earthquake as the formula of the inertial coefficient was obtained based on sinusoidal ground motions it cannot be directly used to calculate the hydrodynamic added mass under the real earthquake because the real earthquake is a signal of narrow bandwidth and it is difficult to describe it by a specific value of frequency therefore a method to calculate the hydrodynamic added mass under the real earthquake is proposed the hydrodynamic added mass under the real earthquake is calculated by the weighted average of hydrodynamic added mass under several sinusoidal ground motions as shown in eq 8 8 m i 1 n η i m i where η i is the weighting coefficient m i is the hydrodynamic added mass under the sinusoidal ground motion with the frequency at which the amplitude of the power spectrum of the earthquake wave is relatively large and n is the number of the points chosen in the power spectrum the points used for calculation in eq 8 are selected based on the following equation 9 a i a m a x 0 3 where a i is the amplitude of the chosen point and a max is the maximum amplitude in the power spectrum the hydrodynamic added mass of the pier under the real earthquake can be calculated by combining eqs 3 and 8 6 underwater shaking table tests validation 6 1 test introduction to validate the proposed formulas and the method for calculating the hydrodynamic added mass under the real earthquake proposed in section 5 a series of underwater shaking table tests were conducted the test equipment is the world s first underwater dual shaking tables test system which was newly built in tianjin university tianjin china as shown in fig 13 the diameters of the two shaking tables are 3 6 m and the load capacity of each table is 20 0 ton without water and 12 0 ton with water the maximum accelerations are 1 5 g in x and y directions and 1 2 g in z direction the two shaking tables are installed in a water pool with a size of 24 8 m 12 5 m 3 m length width depth and the maximum depth of water in experiment is 2 0 m two groups of rocker flap wave makers are installed on one long side of the pool and the adjacent short side to generate waves in two directions the specimens are two circle steel tubes with diameters of 101 mm specimen d and 351 mm specimen e and the height is 1 4 m the water depth is 0 6 m in the test fig 14 shows the specimen e without and with water respectively the sinusoidal ground motions and earthquake waves are adopted in the tests the frequencies and amplitudes of the sinusoidal motions are the same as that listed in table 1 the earthquake waves are el centro 1940 taft 1952 and tianjin 1976 and the acceleration amplitudes are 0 2 g 6 2 test results and analysis fig 15 shows the hydrodynamic added mass of specimens d and e under sinusoidal motions with different action frequencies where the black point represents the test results and the solid line represents the results calculated by eq 3 it can be observed from fig 15 that the hydrodynamic added mass calculated by eq 3 matched well with the test results under different conditions and the maximum relative error was less than 10 table 5 gives the hydrodynamic added mass calculated by eq 8 and test results under different earthquake waves as indicated by table 5 the value of the added mass calculated by eq 8 was very closed to that of test results and the maximum relative error was 14 1 therefore the formulas and the method proposed in section 5 were verified to be able to calculate the hydrodynamic added mass of pier under real earthquake 7 conclusions to investigate the hydrodynamic added mass and the inertial coefficient in the morison equation for earthquake induced hydrodynamic added mass a dynamic test system with a water tank and an actuator was put up to perform a series of dynamic tests on four cylindrical steel tubes the variety of tube diameter water depth action frequency action amplitude was considered in the tests the major conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the test results didn t agree with morison equation for earthquake induced hydrodynamic added mass in the changing rules of added mass with action frequency specimen diameter and water depth 2 the hydrodynamic added mass increased with structure diameter and water depth the added mass could increase by 28 times when the diameter increased from 101 mm to 610 mm while the added mass increased by 14 times when the water depth increased from 0 2 m to 0 8 m 3 the hydrodynamic added mass first decreased and then increased with the action frequency increasing and changed little with the action amplitude the added mass could decrease 38 5 with action frequency increasing from 4 to 15 hz and could increase 77 with action frequency increasing from 15 to 40 hz 4 the inertial coefficient was relatively larger with deeper water and smaller diameter and it first decreased and then increased with the increase of action frequency 5 the proposed formula and method matched well with the results of underwater shaking table tests and they can be used to calculate the hydrodynamic added mass of cylindrical structures under earthquake action the conclusions obtained in this study mainly apply to cylinders and the proposed formulas are valid where the values of relate parameters are of the range in this study acknowledgment the authors gratefully acknowledge the support for this research from the national

22586,in recent years seabed scouring caused by propeller jet flow impact its resulting structural and environmental effects and the increase in the use of powerful engines with the introduction of new types of ships with large sized bows and main thrusters have become major issues consequently there is a need for an accurate method to investigate scour formations and a protection method near berth structures caused by the propeller jet flow of a ship the objective of this study was to examine the local scour caused by propeller wash in front of a quay wall as a closed type berth structure in the equilibrium final state the maximum scour depth at the toe of the quay wall as one of the primary dimensions of the scour was investigated under different propeller gaps propeller speeds and distances from the propeller face in addition the time dependent variation of the scour profiles was examined and a new empirical equation was proposed for the determination of the scour depth at the toe of a quay wall keywords quay wall jet flow local scour propeller wash sediment transport 1 introduction large vessels typically cause structural instability owing to the scouring problem occurring during their berthing and un berthing movements a propeller jet has a three dimensional 3d flow area and high velocity which may cause erosion around the berthing structures at the sloping banks of the navigation channels at the toe of a vertical quay wall and around piles this erosion in many cases threatens to undermine a closed type berth structure as illustrated in the p i a n c 2015 report fig 1 in general various researchers have studied the scouring problem on sediment bed by physical modeling chiew and lim 1996 hong et al 2013 and tan and yuksel 2018a experimentally studied and focused on the mechanism of the scouring due to a jet flow in the absence of a berth structure furthermore propeller jet induced scour at the toe of a quay wall has also been studied previously hamill et al 1999 römisch 2012 ryan et al 2013a ryan et al 2013b cihan et al 2012 yuksel et al 2012 yuksel et al 2018 johnston et al 2013 tested different clearances of propeller with and without sediment bed conditions to determine the expansion of propeller wash recent studies investigated scour induced by twin propeller mujal colilles et al 2017a carried out a study on determination of bed velocities under the influence of twin propellers mujal colilles et al 2018 conducted experiments in a tank using a twin propeller model to estimate the consequences and the maximum scouring depth during the backward docking and forward undocking scenarios to reproduce the real arrival and departure maneuvers in addition propeller jet induced scour has also been investigated with field studies mujal colilles et al 2017b studied scouring process due to a single propeller jet and they used the data set at a particular basin s bathymetries during a specific period they also evaluated the proposed equations for the estimation of scour depth with considering the data obtained from the basin field hayes et al 2009 studied sediment resuspension induced by vessel s propeller commonly used for dredging they stated that the growth of marine traffic cause resuspension of contaminated materials deposited at the seabed hamill et al 1999 studied the scouring formation induced by a propeller jet flow both unconfined and confined by a quay wall they examined the scouring process for different distances of the quay wall from the propeller jet hamill et al 1999 also gave an expression to estimate the change in the maximum depth of a scour in the final eroded profile in the presence of a quay wall in addition römisch 2012 formulated the expression for the scour depth near a vertical quay wall for bow thrusters his test results showed that the development of a scour hole owing to jets can be divided into two phases in the first phase when the propeller jet load was low the depth of the scour hole increased very rapidly with increasing jet load when the jet load was increased further the development of the scour hole was less intensive ryan et al 2013a performed an experimental investigation of the scouring formation at the toe of a quay wall under the rudder effect they also extended their study and examined the scour formation at the toe of a quay wall under the rudder effect under wave conditions ryan et al 2013b only a few literature proposed an equation to compute the final scour under main propeller jets with a quay wall condition however a lack of formulation is found when trying to evaluate the scouring at the toe of quay wall consequently in the presented study the seabed scour mechanism caused by a propeller jet flow in the absence no wall case and presence of a quay wall with wall case as a closed type berth structure was investigated the effect of different propeller gaps g speeds rpm or u0 and diameters dp on the scour formation near the quay wall were examined at various distances from wall to the propeller xw this research aimed to evaluate the existing equations for the prediction of scour induced by a propeller jet at the toe of a quay wall sw in the equilibrium final state moreover this study also examined the time dependent variation of the scour profile and interaction between the propeller jet flow and quay wall in the extended experimental conditions 2 experimental setup the experiments were conducted in a flume to simulate the propeller jet flow conditions on a non cohesive sand bed for both the unconfined no wall case and confined with wall case conditions the sides of the working section in the flume at the hydraulics and coastal engineering laboratory of the civil engineering department at yıldız technical university were made of glass having a total length of 6 02 m width of 1 42 m and depth of 1 0 m as shown in fig 2 the working section in the tank was constructed with a 0 20 m deep 1 90 m long and 1 42 m wide sediment between the false floors at each end water filled slowly up to 0 5 m depth without disturbing the sediment bed and the propeller was rotated at a constant speed until the scouring formation reached its equilibrium final condition the final scouring condition was defined based on the time needed for the development of the scour profile beyond which there was no change in the scour hole within a range of 1 mm at the end of each test the scour profile was measured with a point gage point gage was used to measure the scour profile along the propeller s centerline at 5 2 and 1 cm intervals in horizontal when the distance between the propeller and the wall was at x 70 35 and 17 5 cm respectively in addition a profile demonstrating scour development with time was obtained in each test a glass box system designed to adjust the distance between the propeller shaft and sand bed g was placed on a movable platform two wageningen b series propellers with 6 5 cm and 10 cm diameters fig 3 were placed on a level controller platform to test the different gaps of the propeller at different propeller speeds of 590 rpm 670 rpm and 745 rpm the characteristics of the propellers used in the experiments are listed in table 1 a series of experiments was performed with different parameters and other operational variables shown in fig 4 the tests were performed on a uniformly distributed sand bed with a median grain size of d50 0 52 mm fig 5 to understand the scour formations under the effect of the propeller jet flow for different conditions such as different gaps g and propeller jet speeds these tests were repeated by changing the wall locations from the propeller face as xw 70 cm 35 cm and 17 5 cm each test under the with wall condition was repeated under thein no wall condition table 2 table 2 lists all the tests that are conducted within the range of 7 73 frd 15 01 where frd is given by 1 fr d u 0 gd 50 ρ s ρ ρ where frd is the densimetric froude number ρ is the water density ρ s is the sediment density g is the gravitational acceleration and d50 is median grain size of the sand bed effective grain particle size for which 50 particles surpass the cumulative particle size and u 0 is the exit plane of the propeller flow called the efflux velocity and is calculated based on the following equation given by p i a n c 2015 2 u 0 e o nd p c t where eo is the efflux velocity coefficient where eo is 1 42 as given in table 3 p is the pitch of the propeller β is the blade area ratio and dh is the hub diameter n is the propeller speed dp is the propeller diameter and ct is the thrust coefficient presented in table 1 blaauw and van de kaa 1978 stated that for the erosion caused by a propeller jet the scaling effects of the viscosity could be neglected if ref and rep as defined in equations 3 and 4 were larger than 3 103 and 7 104 respectively rajatratham 1981 stated that the viscosity effect could be neglected for the scour caused by a plain wall jet if the reynolds number of the flow ref was 104 with the propeller jet properties used by hamill 1987 the value of ref was found to be between 1 2 105 and 2 3 105 and therefore the effect of viscosity could be neglected in the present study all the reynolds flow numbers exceeded 3 103 thus the scaling effects owing to viscosity were neglected 3 re f d p u 0 ν 4 re p nd p l m ν where ref is the reynolds flow number rep is the reynolds propeller number u0 is the efflux velocity and n is the number of the propeller revolutions per second rps lm was calculated based on the equation proposed by blaauw and van de kaa 1978 5 l m β d p π 2 n 1 d h d p 1 where lm is the characteristic length of the propeller dh is the diameter of the hub of the propeller β is the blade area ratio of the propeller and n is number of the blades the experiments for this study are not based on a real prototype which has to be scaled and tested the main objective of this study focuses on the comparison and examination of the processes it is therefore better to consider process orientated experiments instead of scale experiments the model dimensions and propeller characteristics were scaled to the scour process within the limitations of the facilities flume and propeller jet mechanism however the scale for the propeller diameters was considered as 1 15 similar to tan and yuksel s 2018a study in order to represent the realistic scene thus the propellers with diameters of 6 5 cm and 10 cm were used in the model corresponding to 1 0 m and 1 5 m propellers set to rotation speeds of 590 670 and 745 rpm tsinker 1995 also stated that one of the main factors which affects the propeller induced scour in design is the position of the propeller in relation to underkeel clearance the gap between the propeller axis and the sand bed g was chosen by considering the recommended minimum of 1 5 m of the underkeel clearance in fairways and maneuvering areas thus the model propeller s gaps were adjusted to 10 cm and 15 cm for 1 50 m and 2 25 m prototype gap heights respectively it is assumed that the experiments are similarly influenced by possible scale effects then the scour depth s one of the primary dimensions of the scouring formation can be described using independent parameters as in the following expression 6 s f u 0 d p n d 50 g ρ g ν ρ s x w l m h where s is the scour depth ρ is the density of the fluid g is the acceleration of gravity ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ρ s is the density of the sediment xw is the horizontal distance between the face of the propeller and quay wall and n is the propeller speed by dimensional consideration this can be expressed as in equation 7 according to the studies by rajatratham 1981 and verhey 1983 scale effects could be neglected for the scour caused by a jet if the reynolds number of the flow ref was 104 and reynolds number of the propeller rep were in the range of 3 104 6 104 in this study ref was found in the range of 4 61 104 13 77 104 and rep was found between 1 28 104 3 79 104 in addition faruque et al 2004 and sarathi 2005 stated that the effect of h dp on the scouring formation may be neglected if the water depth h was larger than six times the diameter of the jet do therefore in the present study the effect of h dp was neglected because the water level h was assumed to be sufficiently high compared to dp the simplified dimensionless parameters in the right hand side of equation were examined to assess the evolution of the scouring process s after all the experiments were conducted 7 s d p fr d d p d 50 x w d p g d 50 ρ s ρ d p l m 3 results and discussion 3 1 development of scour profiles in the present study the time dependent variation of the maximum scour depth was measured to consider the duration required for the scour hole to attain its equilibrium state for each test under the with wall condition moreover the duration was chosen because the final scour profile varied within a range of 1 mm during the experiments as stated by tan and yuksel 2018a and yuksel et al 2018 after which all the tests had reached their equilibrium state fig 6 in the experiments the termination time was considered as 160 min the scour formations had different profiles related to the changing parameters such as the propeller diameter dp speed u0 gap g and wall distance from the propeller xw thus the effect of the wall location propeller diameter gap and speed on the scouring formation were examined under the propeller jet flow therefore one parameter was changed while the other parameters were kept constant and the measured scour profiles were compared to examine the parameters g xw propeller speed influencing the scouring processes all the time dependent scour profiles along the centerline of the propellers with dp 10 cm and 6 5 cm in the presence of the quay wall are illustrated in figs 7 9 these figures also compare the scour profiles under the no wall condition with those under the with wall condition for the same sand bed material the scour profiles for different wall locations xw 17 5 cm 35 cm and 70 cm apart from the face of the propeller at different propeller diameters speeds and gaps are illustrated in figs 7 9 respectively the wall is located in the observed i upstream section of the scour zone xw 17 5 cm ii scour zone xw 35 cm iii deposition zone xw 70 cm under the no wall condition in figs 7 figs 8 and 9 respectively fig 7 shows the measured scour depths after the scour hole attains its equilibrium state for each test without considering the quay wall structure when a quay wall is located at the upstream section of the maximum scour hole observed in the no wall case xw 17 5 cm a higher scour depth occurs close to the wall as shown in fig 7 this is because the scour forms more easily near the quay wall compared to the no wall case owing to the downflows and vortex flow field at the toe of a quay wall which initiate scouring on the sand bed fig 8 shows the comparisons of the scour profiles when the quay wall is located in the observed scour region in the no wall case xw 35 cm for dp 6 5 cm and xw 70 cm for dp 10 cm the scour near the quay wall at xw 35 cm is higher than in the no wall cases except in fig 8a similar to the cases at xw 17 5 cm in fig 7 the time dependent scour profiles also display that the scour depths near the quay wall are higher than in the no wall cases and are formed in a very short time just after 30 min relative to the total test duration fig 8 in fig 9 the quay wall is located at xw 70 cm distance from the face of the propeller which is in the observed deposition zone for the no wall cases the scour profiles in fig 9 show that a scour may be formed instead of a deposition mound in the with wall cases compared to the no wall cases this is because the flow pattern changes that occur owing to the existence of a quay wall are characterized to be downflow in front of the wall and there is generation of horseshoe vortices in the scour hole as stated by qi and gao 2014 the observation shows that two consecutive scours are formed the first scour is formed owing to the direct impact of propeller jet impact on the sea bed whereas the second scour is formed owing to the interaction between the jet flow and wall the position of the wall is an effective parameter for the scouring formation as an example fig 10 illustrates the comparisons of the different scour profile formations when the wall distance from the propeller face is changed as xw 70 cm 35 cm and 17 5 cm while the propeller speed and gap are kept constant the wall is located in the observed i upstream section of the scour zone ii scour zone and iii deposition zone under the no wall condition with xw 17 5 cm 35 cm and 70 cm respectively fig 10 this figure shows that the eroded zone is not changed significantly when the quay wall is located in the deposition zone xw 70 cm under the no wall condition although there is a scour with a relatively small scour depth in front of the wall however the scour depth increases at the toe of the wall when the wall is located close to the propeller at xw 17 5 cm and 35 cm compared to the scour depth under the no wall condition as can be seen in fig 10 figs 11 and 12 illustrate the equilibrium scour profiles under the same experimental conditions for those presented in fig 10 but at two different propeller gaps g 15 cm and g 10 cm and for two different propeller speeds frd 8 77 and frd 9 76 respectively these figures show that the scour at the toe of the wall increases as the distance of the wall from the propeller decreases from the comparisons of figs 10 12 it is seen that a large gap and low propeller speed produce a small scour depth and the scouring formations in these figures show similarities significant differences are observed in the scour profiles for the with wall cases compared to those for the no wall cases as shown in figs 10 12 therefore when a vertical quay wall is placed in the observed scour profile zones the scouring profiles are different from those of the no wall cases as illustrated in fig 13 in the figure smc is the maximum depth of the scour in the equilibrium state under the with wall condition smw is the maximum scour depth at the toe of the quay wall and xw is the horizontal distance of the wall from the propeller face in the present study when the quay wall is located at different locations in the observed scour zones and deposition zone for the no wall cases mainly two different scour profiles are observed under the tested conditions at different propeller speeds and gaps for the same sand bed type 1 and 2 scour profiles are defined based on the comparisons of the scour depths at the toe of wall smw and those for the no wall conditions smu by considering all the scour profiles obtained in the equilibrium state fig 13 in the equilibrium state type 1 profiles are observed when a large scour depth is found at the toe of the wall smw smu whereas type 2 profiles are noticed for large scour depths under the no wall conditions smw smu which are mainly derived by the wall location this is because a decrease in the wall distance from the propeller face will cause more severe downflows and vortex mechanisms at the toe of the wall which will generate a deeper scour at the toe of the wall as seen in the type 1 scour profiles the type 1 scour profiles show another distinct scour profile development in which the maximum scour depth smc occurs slightly in front of the wall smc smw hamill et al 1999 showed that the development of the scouring mechanism could be different at different positions of the quay wall they observed that a scour hole started to develop similar to in the profiles for the no wall cases for xw xmu 0 636 and xw xmu 0 909 however there was additional erosion at the toe of the wall when the wall was placed in the scour zone occurring under the no wall condition when the wall was placed further away from the propeller for xw xmu 2 727 the position of the maximum scour moved further away from the propeller they also stated that the maximum depth of a scour tended to reduce for xw xmu 3 27 in the presented study the scour profiles were evaluated by using dimensionless parameters e g s smu and x xmu similar to those given by hamill et al 1999 when considering the extended test conditions such as different propeller gaps speeds and diameters the relative scour depths s smu in the cases when the quay walls are absent are always smaller than the scours at the toe of the wall when the wall is at x 17 5 cm from the face of the propeller figs 14 and 15 this is because the wall structure is highly effective in promoting the scouring formation at close distances as 17 5 cm from the propeller however the relative scour depths at the toe of the wall decrease when the distance between the wall and propeller face increase to x 35 cm and 70 cm as seen in fig 14a c respectively conditions are observed in the experimental study conducted with a larger gap of the propeller at 15 cm case 2 as shown in fig 14d f that are similar to the conditions in case 1 increasing the propeller speed from frd 7 73 to frd 9 76 is also effective when case 1 in fig 14 and case 3 in fig 15 are compared at the same propeller diameter dp 6 5 cm and gap at g 10 cm as an example similar scouring formations under the with wall and no wall conditions are observed at a low propeller speed of 590 rpm frd 7 73 at xw 35 cm in fig 14c in comparison the observed scour at the toe of the wall corresponds to the deposition zone condition for the no wall condition at xw 35 cm as shown in in fig 15c the results in figs 14 and 15 are compatible with those of hamill et al 1999 all the test results for the different wall distances at xw 17 5 cm 35 cm and 70 cm from the face of the propeller show that the maximum scour starts to decrease when xw xmu is larger than approximately 2 comparisons of scour profiles with wall and no wall conditions given by hamill et al 1999 and results of present study for similar wall locations is shown in fig 16 in this figure the wall location is shown with solid and dashed line in hamill et al 1999 s and the present study respectively two different limit cases were compared the wall is located in the observed upstream section of the scour zone and deposition zone under the no wall condition in fig 16a wall is located at xw 0 56xmu and xw 0 636 xmu in the present study and hamill et al 1999 study respectively in fig 16b wall is located xw 2 272 xmu and xw 2 26xmu in the present study and hamill et al 1999 study respectively in the present study scour profiles with wall condition showed similar trend but they were not in good agreement with hamill et al 1999 s for similar wall locations fig 16 this is because even compared scour values have similar wall location xw scour profiles formed under different conditions such as different propeller diameter speed gap and sediment bed material as an example hamill et al s 1999 tests are valid within the ranges of 0 77 g dp 3 08 and 2 17 frd 15 01 while this study is valid within the range of 1 g dp 2 3 and 7 73 frd 15 01 3 2 determination of scour depth the scouring problem was first addressed by using a submerged circular jet for simulating the rotating propeller while avoiding the complexity of a propeller jet flow e g chiew and lim 1996 yuksel et al 2005 however lam et al 2011 also confirmed that a propeller jet has a complex flow with axial tangential and radial components of the velocity therefore most of the experimental expressions for predicting the local scour dimensions caused by a propeller wash during the berthing and un berthing movements of the vessels are published considering the absence of the berth structure e g hamill 1987 hong et al 2013 yew et al 2017 tan and yüksel 2018 therefore different researchers have proposed equations for predicting the size of the scour depth while considering the presence of a berth structure hashmi 1993 hamill et al 1999 ryan et al 2013a yüksel et al 2018b hamill et al 1999 studied the scouring action of the wash generated by a propeller in the presence of a vertical quay wall structure they proposed equation 8 for the estimation of the maximum scour depth confined by a quay wall with 5 55 frd 18 53 and 0 005 d50 dp 0 05 in this study the measured scour depths at the toe of wall were compared with the calculated scour depths according to equation 8 in fig 17 a 8 smc smu s m a 1 1 18 x w x m u 0 2 where smu is the maximum depth of an unconfined scour in the equilibrium state no wall case sma is the maximum depth of the unconfined scour in the equilibrium state measured relative to the propeller shaft axis smu g smc is the maximum depth of the confined scour with wall case in the equilibrium state xmu is the distance from the propeller face to the point of maximum scour in the unconfined profile and xw is the distance from propeller face to the location of the wall ryan et al 2013a also gave equation 9 for the estimation of the maximum scour depth under a wall condition with considering the densimetric froude number frd 9 smw smu s m w 1 1 217 fr d 0 019 x w x m u 0 195 where smw is the maximum scour depth at the toe of the quay wall and x is distance between the pile and the face of the propeller fig 17b shows a comparison of the calculated scour depth when using the equation 9 formulated by ryan et al 2013a with the data in the presented study the dashed lines in figs 17a and b shows the linear regressions of measured and calculated data with correlation coefficients the equation of hamill et al 1999 underestimates the measured scour depths with a determination coefficient of r2 0 67 whereas the measured scour depths for ryan et al 2013a are estimated to be slightly higher with r2 0 82 scour developments at the toe of the quay wall smw were investigated by considering dimensionless parameters defined in the previous section in the range of 7 73 frd 15 01 when changing the location of the quay wall as xw dp 2 7 10 8 linearized plots of equation 10 for the prediction of scouring near the quay wall smw dp versus the measured data of smw dp are in good agreement considering that the mean of the determination coefficient is 0 81 fig 18 the data evaluated at 95 certainty level p 0 05 lie within the upper and lower prediction limits as seen in fig 18 the measured data also have a linear component that can be described by a best fit line reference line with a 1 1 slope for equation 10 comparison of the data calculated by using equation 10 versus the measured data yields the smaller root mean squared error of 0 17 for the former where smw is the maximum scour depth at the toe of the quay wall g is the gap of the propeller d50 is the median sand size and xw is the horizontal distance between the wall and face of the propeller 10 s mw d p 0 512 fr d 2 27 g d 50 0 65 x w d p 0 543 4 conclusion in this study the effect of a propeller jet flow near a quay wall on a sand bed with d50 0 52 mm was examined in a flume at different propeller gaps sizes and speeds the scour tests were conducted for the densimetric froude number varying as 7 73 frd 15 01 the following results were obtained existence of a perpendicular quay wall produced larger scour depths at the toe of the wall compared under the no wall conditions owing to variation in the distance of the wall from the propeller face when xw xmu was less than around 2 0 in this paper comparisons of the scour formations on the cohesionless sand bed formed by a propeller jet without considering any berth structure were also given the presented experiment showed that the shapes of the scouring formations depended on the propeller diameter jet velocity gap and distance between the propeller and quay wall location two different characteristic scour profiles were defined near the berth structure at varying quay wall locations the exact limit existing between the type 1 and type 2 scour profiles could not be defined but a specified description was identified by the comparisons of the maximum scour depths at the toe of the wall smw and for the no wall condition smu different characteristic scour profiles were defined near the quay wall changing the distances between the propeller and quay wall caused variation in the scouring formation type the maximum scour depth was found to occur at the toe or in the upstream zone of the wall owing to the different propeller gaps sizes speeds and wall positions equations for the prediction of the maximum scour depth under confined conditions in the presence of a quay wall were given by hamill et al 1999 and ryan et al 2013a in the previous literature this study presented new empirical equations developed for the estimation of the final scour depths at the toe of the wall smw based on the consideration of changing wall locations from the face of the propeller within the range of 7 73 frd 15 01 when changing the location of the quay wall as xw dp 2 7 10 8 the use of the new equation presented in this study allowed the estimation of the maximum scour depth ssw the equations presented in this paper now provide an engineer with the ability to estimate the scour dimensions near a quay wall under propeller jet flow conditions with the assumption of zero advance speeds simulating the maneuvering operation of a ship 
22586,in recent years seabed scouring caused by propeller jet flow impact its resulting structural and environmental effects and the increase in the use of powerful engines with the introduction of new types of ships with large sized bows and main thrusters have become major issues consequently there is a need for an accurate method to investigate scour formations and a protection method near berth structures caused by the propeller jet flow of a ship the objective of this study was to examine the local scour caused by propeller wash in front of a quay wall as a closed type berth structure in the equilibrium final state the maximum scour depth at the toe of the quay wall as one of the primary dimensions of the scour was investigated under different propeller gaps propeller speeds and distances from the propeller face in addition the time dependent variation of the scour profiles was examined and a new empirical equation was proposed for the determination of the scour depth at the toe of a quay wall keywords quay wall jet flow local scour propeller wash sediment transport 1 introduction large vessels typically cause structural instability owing to the scouring problem occurring during their berthing and un berthing movements a propeller jet has a three dimensional 3d flow area and high velocity which may cause erosion around the berthing structures at the sloping banks of the navigation channels at the toe of a vertical quay wall and around piles this erosion in many cases threatens to undermine a closed type berth structure as illustrated in the p i a n c 2015 report fig 1 in general various researchers have studied the scouring problem on sediment bed by physical modeling chiew and lim 1996 hong et al 2013 and tan and yuksel 2018a experimentally studied and focused on the mechanism of the scouring due to a jet flow in the absence of a berth structure furthermore propeller jet induced scour at the toe of a quay wall has also been studied previously hamill et al 1999 römisch 2012 ryan et al 2013a ryan et al 2013b cihan et al 2012 yuksel et al 2012 yuksel et al 2018 johnston et al 2013 tested different clearances of propeller with and without sediment bed conditions to determine the expansion of propeller wash recent studies investigated scour induced by twin propeller mujal colilles et al 2017a carried out a study on determination of bed velocities under the influence of twin propellers mujal colilles et al 2018 conducted experiments in a tank using a twin propeller model to estimate the consequences and the maximum scouring depth during the backward docking and forward undocking scenarios to reproduce the real arrival and departure maneuvers in addition propeller jet induced scour has also been investigated with field studies mujal colilles et al 2017b studied scouring process due to a single propeller jet and they used the data set at a particular basin s bathymetries during a specific period they also evaluated the proposed equations for the estimation of scour depth with considering the data obtained from the basin field hayes et al 2009 studied sediment resuspension induced by vessel s propeller commonly used for dredging they stated that the growth of marine traffic cause resuspension of contaminated materials deposited at the seabed hamill et al 1999 studied the scouring formation induced by a propeller jet flow both unconfined and confined by a quay wall they examined the scouring process for different distances of the quay wall from the propeller jet hamill et al 1999 also gave an expression to estimate the change in the maximum depth of a scour in the final eroded profile in the presence of a quay wall in addition römisch 2012 formulated the expression for the scour depth near a vertical quay wall for bow thrusters his test results showed that the development of a scour hole owing to jets can be divided into two phases in the first phase when the propeller jet load was low the depth of the scour hole increased very rapidly with increasing jet load when the jet load was increased further the development of the scour hole was less intensive ryan et al 2013a performed an experimental investigation of the scouring formation at the toe of a quay wall under the rudder effect they also extended their study and examined the scour formation at the toe of a quay wall under the rudder effect under wave conditions ryan et al 2013b only a few literature proposed an equation to compute the final scour under main propeller jets with a quay wall condition however a lack of formulation is found when trying to evaluate the scouring at the toe of quay wall consequently in the presented study the seabed scour mechanism caused by a propeller jet flow in the absence no wall case and presence of a quay wall with wall case as a closed type berth structure was investigated the effect of different propeller gaps g speeds rpm or u0 and diameters dp on the scour formation near the quay wall were examined at various distances from wall to the propeller xw this research aimed to evaluate the existing equations for the prediction of scour induced by a propeller jet at the toe of a quay wall sw in the equilibrium final state moreover this study also examined the time dependent variation of the scour profile and interaction between the propeller jet flow and quay wall in the extended experimental conditions 2 experimental setup the experiments were conducted in a flume to simulate the propeller jet flow conditions on a non cohesive sand bed for both the unconfined no wall case and confined with wall case conditions the sides of the working section in the flume at the hydraulics and coastal engineering laboratory of the civil engineering department at yıldız technical university were made of glass having a total length of 6 02 m width of 1 42 m and depth of 1 0 m as shown in fig 2 the working section in the tank was constructed with a 0 20 m deep 1 90 m long and 1 42 m wide sediment between the false floors at each end water filled slowly up to 0 5 m depth without disturbing the sediment bed and the propeller was rotated at a constant speed until the scouring formation reached its equilibrium final condition the final scouring condition was defined based on the time needed for the development of the scour profile beyond which there was no change in the scour hole within a range of 1 mm at the end of each test the scour profile was measured with a point gage point gage was used to measure the scour profile along the propeller s centerline at 5 2 and 1 cm intervals in horizontal when the distance between the propeller and the wall was at x 70 35 and 17 5 cm respectively in addition a profile demonstrating scour development with time was obtained in each test a glass box system designed to adjust the distance between the propeller shaft and sand bed g was placed on a movable platform two wageningen b series propellers with 6 5 cm and 10 cm diameters fig 3 were placed on a level controller platform to test the different gaps of the propeller at different propeller speeds of 590 rpm 670 rpm and 745 rpm the characteristics of the propellers used in the experiments are listed in table 1 a series of experiments was performed with different parameters and other operational variables shown in fig 4 the tests were performed on a uniformly distributed sand bed with a median grain size of d50 0 52 mm fig 5 to understand the scour formations under the effect of the propeller jet flow for different conditions such as different gaps g and propeller jet speeds these tests were repeated by changing the wall locations from the propeller face as xw 70 cm 35 cm and 17 5 cm each test under the with wall condition was repeated under thein no wall condition table 2 table 2 lists all the tests that are conducted within the range of 7 73 frd 15 01 where frd is given by 1 fr d u 0 gd 50 ρ s ρ ρ where frd is the densimetric froude number ρ is the water density ρ s is the sediment density g is the gravitational acceleration and d50 is median grain size of the sand bed effective grain particle size for which 50 particles surpass the cumulative particle size and u 0 is the exit plane of the propeller flow called the efflux velocity and is calculated based on the following equation given by p i a n c 2015 2 u 0 e o nd p c t where eo is the efflux velocity coefficient where eo is 1 42 as given in table 3 p is the pitch of the propeller β is the blade area ratio and dh is the hub diameter n is the propeller speed dp is the propeller diameter and ct is the thrust coefficient presented in table 1 blaauw and van de kaa 1978 stated that for the erosion caused by a propeller jet the scaling effects of the viscosity could be neglected if ref and rep as defined in equations 3 and 4 were larger than 3 103 and 7 104 respectively rajatratham 1981 stated that the viscosity effect could be neglected for the scour caused by a plain wall jet if the reynolds number of the flow ref was 104 with the propeller jet properties used by hamill 1987 the value of ref was found to be between 1 2 105 and 2 3 105 and therefore the effect of viscosity could be neglected in the present study all the reynolds flow numbers exceeded 3 103 thus the scaling effects owing to viscosity were neglected 3 re f d p u 0 ν 4 re p nd p l m ν where ref is the reynolds flow number rep is the reynolds propeller number u0 is the efflux velocity and n is the number of the propeller revolutions per second rps lm was calculated based on the equation proposed by blaauw and van de kaa 1978 5 l m β d p π 2 n 1 d h d p 1 where lm is the characteristic length of the propeller dh is the diameter of the hub of the propeller β is the blade area ratio of the propeller and n is number of the blades the experiments for this study are not based on a real prototype which has to be scaled and tested the main objective of this study focuses on the comparison and examination of the processes it is therefore better to consider process orientated experiments instead of scale experiments the model dimensions and propeller characteristics were scaled to the scour process within the limitations of the facilities flume and propeller jet mechanism however the scale for the propeller diameters was considered as 1 15 similar to tan and yuksel s 2018a study in order to represent the realistic scene thus the propellers with diameters of 6 5 cm and 10 cm were used in the model corresponding to 1 0 m and 1 5 m propellers set to rotation speeds of 590 670 and 745 rpm tsinker 1995 also stated that one of the main factors which affects the propeller induced scour in design is the position of the propeller in relation to underkeel clearance the gap between the propeller axis and the sand bed g was chosen by considering the recommended minimum of 1 5 m of the underkeel clearance in fairways and maneuvering areas thus the model propeller s gaps were adjusted to 10 cm and 15 cm for 1 50 m and 2 25 m prototype gap heights respectively it is assumed that the experiments are similarly influenced by possible scale effects then the scour depth s one of the primary dimensions of the scouring formation can be described using independent parameters as in the following expression 6 s f u 0 d p n d 50 g ρ g ν ρ s x w l m h where s is the scour depth ρ is the density of the fluid g is the acceleration of gravity ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ρ s is the density of the sediment xw is the horizontal distance between the face of the propeller and quay wall and n is the propeller speed by dimensional consideration this can be expressed as in equation 7 according to the studies by rajatratham 1981 and verhey 1983 scale effects could be neglected for the scour caused by a jet if the reynolds number of the flow ref was 104 and reynolds number of the propeller rep were in the range of 3 104 6 104 in this study ref was found in the range of 4 61 104 13 77 104 and rep was found between 1 28 104 3 79 104 in addition faruque et al 2004 and sarathi 2005 stated that the effect of h dp on the scouring formation may be neglected if the water depth h was larger than six times the diameter of the jet do therefore in the present study the effect of h dp was neglected because the water level h was assumed to be sufficiently high compared to dp the simplified dimensionless parameters in the right hand side of equation were examined to assess the evolution of the scouring process s after all the experiments were conducted 7 s d p fr d d p d 50 x w d p g d 50 ρ s ρ d p l m 3 results and discussion 3 1 development of scour profiles in the present study the time dependent variation of the maximum scour depth was measured to consider the duration required for the scour hole to attain its equilibrium state for each test under the with wall condition moreover the duration was chosen because the final scour profile varied within a range of 1 mm during the experiments as stated by tan and yuksel 2018a and yuksel et al 2018 after which all the tests had reached their equilibrium state fig 6 in the experiments the termination time was considered as 160 min the scour formations had different profiles related to the changing parameters such as the propeller diameter dp speed u0 gap g and wall distance from the propeller xw thus the effect of the wall location propeller diameter gap and speed on the scouring formation were examined under the propeller jet flow therefore one parameter was changed while the other parameters were kept constant and the measured scour profiles were compared to examine the parameters g xw propeller speed influencing the scouring processes all the time dependent scour profiles along the centerline of the propellers with dp 10 cm and 6 5 cm in the presence of the quay wall are illustrated in figs 7 9 these figures also compare the scour profiles under the no wall condition with those under the with wall condition for the same sand bed material the scour profiles for different wall locations xw 17 5 cm 35 cm and 70 cm apart from the face of the propeller at different propeller diameters speeds and gaps are illustrated in figs 7 9 respectively the wall is located in the observed i upstream section of the scour zone xw 17 5 cm ii scour zone xw 35 cm iii deposition zone xw 70 cm under the no wall condition in figs 7 figs 8 and 9 respectively fig 7 shows the measured scour depths after the scour hole attains its equilibrium state for each test without considering the quay wall structure when a quay wall is located at the upstream section of the maximum scour hole observed in the no wall case xw 17 5 cm a higher scour depth occurs close to the wall as shown in fig 7 this is because the scour forms more easily near the quay wall compared to the no wall case owing to the downflows and vortex flow field at the toe of a quay wall which initiate scouring on the sand bed fig 8 shows the comparisons of the scour profiles when the quay wall is located in the observed scour region in the no wall case xw 35 cm for dp 6 5 cm and xw 70 cm for dp 10 cm the scour near the quay wall at xw 35 cm is higher than in the no wall cases except in fig 8a similar to the cases at xw 17 5 cm in fig 7 the time dependent scour profiles also display that the scour depths near the quay wall are higher than in the no wall cases and are formed in a very short time just after 30 min relative to the total test duration fig 8 in fig 9 the quay wall is located at xw 70 cm distance from the face of the propeller which is in the observed deposition zone for the no wall cases the scour profiles in fig 9 show that a scour may be formed instead of a deposition mound in the with wall cases compared to the no wall cases this is because the flow pattern changes that occur owing to the existence of a quay wall are characterized to be downflow in front of the wall and there is generation of horseshoe vortices in the scour hole as stated by qi and gao 2014 the observation shows that two consecutive scours are formed the first scour is formed owing to the direct impact of propeller jet impact on the sea bed whereas the second scour is formed owing to the interaction between the jet flow and wall the position of the wall is an effective parameter for the scouring formation as an example fig 10 illustrates the comparisons of the different scour profile formations when the wall distance from the propeller face is changed as xw 70 cm 35 cm and 17 5 cm while the propeller speed and gap are kept constant the wall is located in the observed i upstream section of the scour zone ii scour zone and iii deposition zone under the no wall condition with xw 17 5 cm 35 cm and 70 cm respectively fig 10 this figure shows that the eroded zone is not changed significantly when the quay wall is located in the deposition zone xw 70 cm under the no wall condition although there is a scour with a relatively small scour depth in front of the wall however the scour depth increases at the toe of the wall when the wall is located close to the propeller at xw 17 5 cm and 35 cm compared to the scour depth under the no wall condition as can be seen in fig 10 figs 11 and 12 illustrate the equilibrium scour profiles under the same experimental conditions for those presented in fig 10 but at two different propeller gaps g 15 cm and g 10 cm and for two different propeller speeds frd 8 77 and frd 9 76 respectively these figures show that the scour at the toe of the wall increases as the distance of the wall from the propeller decreases from the comparisons of figs 10 12 it is seen that a large gap and low propeller speed produce a small scour depth and the scouring formations in these figures show similarities significant differences are observed in the scour profiles for the with wall cases compared to those for the no wall cases as shown in figs 10 12 therefore when a vertical quay wall is placed in the observed scour profile zones the scouring profiles are different from those of the no wall cases as illustrated in fig 13 in the figure smc is the maximum depth of the scour in the equilibrium state under the with wall condition smw is the maximum scour depth at the toe of the quay wall and xw is the horizontal distance of the wall from the propeller face in the present study when the quay wall is located at different locations in the observed scour zones and deposition zone for the no wall cases mainly two different scour profiles are observed under the tested conditions at different propeller speeds and gaps for the same sand bed type 1 and 2 scour profiles are defined based on the comparisons of the scour depths at the toe of wall smw and those for the no wall conditions smu by considering all the scour profiles obtained in the equilibrium state fig 13 in the equilibrium state type 1 profiles are observed when a large scour depth is found at the toe of the wall smw smu whereas type 2 profiles are noticed for large scour depths under the no wall conditions smw smu which are mainly derived by the wall location this is because a decrease in the wall distance from the propeller face will cause more severe downflows and vortex mechanisms at the toe of the wall which will generate a deeper scour at the toe of the wall as seen in the type 1 scour profiles the type 1 scour profiles show another distinct scour profile development in which the maximum scour depth smc occurs slightly in front of the wall smc smw hamill et al 1999 showed that the development of the scouring mechanism could be different at different positions of the quay wall they observed that a scour hole started to develop similar to in the profiles for the no wall cases for xw xmu 0 636 and xw xmu 0 909 however there was additional erosion at the toe of the wall when the wall was placed in the scour zone occurring under the no wall condition when the wall was placed further away from the propeller for xw xmu 2 727 the position of the maximum scour moved further away from the propeller they also stated that the maximum depth of a scour tended to reduce for xw xmu 3 27 in the presented study the scour profiles were evaluated by using dimensionless parameters e g s smu and x xmu similar to those given by hamill et al 1999 when considering the extended test conditions such as different propeller gaps speeds and diameters the relative scour depths s smu in the cases when the quay walls are absent are always smaller than the scours at the toe of the wall when the wall is at x 17 5 cm from the face of the propeller figs 14 and 15 this is because the wall structure is highly effective in promoting the scouring formation at close distances as 17 5 cm from the propeller however the relative scour depths at the toe of the wall decrease when the distance between the wall and propeller face increase to x 35 cm and 70 cm as seen in fig 14a c respectively conditions are observed in the experimental study conducted with a larger gap of the propeller at 15 cm case 2 as shown in fig 14d f that are similar to the conditions in case 1 increasing the propeller speed from frd 7 73 to frd 9 76 is also effective when case 1 in fig 14 and case 3 in fig 15 are compared at the same propeller diameter dp 6 5 cm and gap at g 10 cm as an example similar scouring formations under the with wall and no wall conditions are observed at a low propeller speed of 590 rpm frd 7 73 at xw 35 cm in fig 14c in comparison the observed scour at the toe of the wall corresponds to the deposition zone condition for the no wall condition at xw 35 cm as shown in in fig 15c the results in figs 14 and 15 are compatible with those of hamill et al 1999 all the test results for the different wall distances at xw 17 5 cm 35 cm and 70 cm from the face of the propeller show that the maximum scour starts to decrease when xw xmu is larger than approximately 2 comparisons of scour profiles with wall and no wall conditions given by hamill et al 1999 and results of present study for similar wall locations is shown in fig 16 in this figure the wall location is shown with solid and dashed line in hamill et al 1999 s and the present study respectively two different limit cases were compared the wall is located in the observed upstream section of the scour zone and deposition zone under the no wall condition in fig 16a wall is located at xw 0 56xmu and xw 0 636 xmu in the present study and hamill et al 1999 study respectively in fig 16b wall is located xw 2 272 xmu and xw 2 26xmu in the present study and hamill et al 1999 study respectively in the present study scour profiles with wall condition showed similar trend but they were not in good agreement with hamill et al 1999 s for similar wall locations fig 16 this is because even compared scour values have similar wall location xw scour profiles formed under different conditions such as different propeller diameter speed gap and sediment bed material as an example hamill et al s 1999 tests are valid within the ranges of 0 77 g dp 3 08 and 2 17 frd 15 01 while this study is valid within the range of 1 g dp 2 3 and 7 73 frd 15 01 3 2 determination of scour depth the scouring problem was first addressed by using a submerged circular jet for simulating the rotating propeller while avoiding the complexity of a propeller jet flow e g chiew and lim 1996 yuksel et al 2005 however lam et al 2011 also confirmed that a propeller jet has a complex flow with axial tangential and radial components of the velocity therefore most of the experimental expressions for predicting the local scour dimensions caused by a propeller wash during the berthing and un berthing movements of the vessels are published considering the absence of the berth structure e g hamill 1987 hong et al 2013 yew et al 2017 tan and yüksel 2018 therefore different researchers have proposed equations for predicting the size of the scour depth while considering the presence of a berth structure hashmi 1993 hamill et al 1999 ryan et al 2013a yüksel et al 2018b hamill et al 1999 studied the scouring action of the wash generated by a propeller in the presence of a vertical quay wall structure they proposed equation 8 for the estimation of the maximum scour depth confined by a quay wall with 5 55 frd 18 53 and 0 005 d50 dp 0 05 in this study the measured scour depths at the toe of wall were compared with the calculated scour depths according to equation 8 in fig 17 a 8 smc smu s m a 1 1 18 x w x m u 0 2 where smu is the maximum depth of an unconfined scour in the equilibrium state no wall case sma is the maximum depth of the unconfined scour in the equilibrium state measured relative to the propeller shaft axis smu g smc is the maximum depth of the confined scour with wall case in the equilibrium state xmu is the distance from the propeller face to the point of maximum scour in the unconfined profile and xw is the distance from propeller face to the location of the wall ryan et al 2013a also gave equation 9 for the estimation of the maximum scour depth under a wall condition with considering the densimetric froude number frd 9 smw smu s m w 1 1 217 fr d 0 019 x w x m u 0 195 where smw is the maximum scour depth at the toe of the quay wall and x is distance between the pile and the face of the propeller fig 17b shows a comparison of the calculated scour depth when using the equation 9 formulated by ryan et al 2013a with the data in the presented study the dashed lines in figs 17a and b shows the linear regressions of measured and calculated data with correlation coefficients the equation of hamill et al 1999 underestimates the measured scour depths with a determination coefficient of r2 0 67 whereas the measured scour depths for ryan et al 2013a are estimated to be slightly higher with r2 0 82 scour developments at the toe of the quay wall smw were investigated by considering dimensionless parameters defined in the previous section in the range of 7 73 frd 15 01 when changing the location of the quay wall as xw dp 2 7 10 8 linearized plots of equation 10 for the prediction of scouring near the quay wall smw dp versus the measured data of smw dp are in good agreement considering that the mean of the determination coefficient is 0 81 fig 18 the data evaluated at 95 certainty level p 0 05 lie within the upper and lower prediction limits as seen in fig 18 the measured data also have a linear component that can be described by a best fit line reference line with a 1 1 slope for equation 10 comparison of the data calculated by using equation 10 versus the measured data yields the smaller root mean squared error of 0 17 for the former where smw is the maximum scour depth at the toe of the quay wall g is the gap of the propeller d50 is the median sand size and xw is the horizontal distance between the wall and face of the propeller 10 s mw d p 0 512 fr d 2 27 g d 50 0 65 x w d p 0 543 4 conclusion in this study the effect of a propeller jet flow near a quay wall on a sand bed with d50 0 52 mm was examined in a flume at different propeller gaps sizes and speeds the scour tests were conducted for the densimetric froude number varying as 7 73 frd 15 01 the following results were obtained existence of a perpendicular quay wall produced larger scour depths at the toe of the wall compared under the no wall conditions owing to variation in the distance of the wall from the propeller face when xw xmu was less than around 2 0 in this paper comparisons of the scour formations on the cohesionless sand bed formed by a propeller jet without considering any berth structure were also given the presented experiment showed that the shapes of the scouring formations depended on the propeller diameter jet velocity gap and distance between the propeller and quay wall location two different characteristic scour profiles were defined near the berth structure at varying quay wall locations the exact limit existing between the type 1 and type 2 scour profiles could not be defined but a specified description was identified by the comparisons of the maximum scour depths at the toe of the wall smw and for the no wall condition smu different characteristic scour profiles were defined near the quay wall changing the distances between the propeller and quay wall caused variation in the scouring formation type the maximum scour depth was found to occur at the toe or in the upstream zone of the wall owing to the different propeller gaps sizes speeds and wall positions equations for the prediction of the maximum scour depth under confined conditions in the presence of a quay wall were given by hamill et al 1999 and ryan et al 2013a in the previous literature this study presented new empirical equations developed for the estimation of the final scour depths at the toe of the wall smw based on the consideration of changing wall locations from the face of the propeller within the range of 7 73 frd 15 01 when changing the location of the quay wall as xw dp 2 7 10 8 the use of the new equation presented in this study allowed the estimation of the maximum scour depth ssw the equations presented in this paper now provide an engineer with the ability to estimate the scour dimensions near a quay wall under propeller jet flow conditions with the assumption of zero advance speeds simulating the maneuvering operation of a ship 
22587,simulations have been conducted to quantify the effects of aspect ratio on the lift and drag coefficient for a finite plate near a free surface large eddy simulations using a vof multiphase model were conducted for a plate length to height aspect ratio of 2 5 5 and 10 for a reynolds number of 50 000 and a froude number of 1 3 eulerian and lagrangian coherent structures were employed to characterize the turbulent flow fields as the aspect ratio increases the mean drag coefficient decreases from 1 88 to 1 73 this is due to an increase in vortex activity caused by separation of the free shear layer at l d of 5 and 10 both the upstream and downstream region are affected by the hairpin like vortices generated from the bursting of the free shear layer with increasing plate length karman vortex shedding from the face near the free surface is suppressed and the influence of tip vortices on the near wake flow is reduced the aspect ratio has a strong influence on the free surface

practical importance in many engineering applications marine current energy harvesting devices and offshore structures such as hydropower systems platforms and pipelines regularly interact with free surfaces simulating free surface flows is a challenging task since the location of the free surface changes continuously interactions between the free surface and the object alter the flow field and the hydrodynamic loadings understanding the fluid structure interaction in flows past objects placed in the vicinity of free surfaces is essential for designing hydraulic devices operating in rivers lakes and oceans flows past objects in the proximity of a free surface have drawn increasing attention lately free surface deformation vortex shedding and hydrodynamic forces acting on a body have been investigated sheridan et al 1997 and malavasi and guadagnini 2007 conducted experiments for flows past a circular rectangular cylinder beneath a free surface at various depths as the cylinder is placed closer to the surface larger surface distortion is observed and large scale vortices are suppressed the mean force coefficients and vortex shedding frequency are strongly influenced by the asymmetric flow patterns at shallow depths liu et al 2016 numerically studied flows past a normal plate near a free surface in two dimensional geometries asymmetric vortex shedding and an increase in strouhal number are observed as the plate depth is decreased reichl et al 2005 numerically investigated flows past a cylinder close to a free surface and reported the suppression of vortex shedding and substantial surface deformations at high froude number fr flows riglin et al 2015 conducted computational fluid dynamics simulations for a hydrokinetic turbine operating near a free surface they showed that the generated mechanical power is reduced significantly as the hydrokinetic turbine operates near a free surface karim et al 2014 and prasad et al 2015 carried out simulations for free surface flows over a shallowly submerged hydrofoil they discovered that the drag coefficient increases as the submergence depth decreases in their studies a wave breaking phenomena is observed at small submergence depths flows past an object with free ends display complex flow structures which are strongly dependent on the aspect ratio of the plate the present study utilizes the eulerian and lagrangian vortex identification methods to characterize turbulent flows past a plate for various values of the aspect ratio the hydrodynamic loadings on the plate in the proximity of a free surface are studied inoue and sakuragi 2008 investigated the effect of the ratio of span length to diameter of the cylinder l d on wake flow structures and reported various shedding patterns as the flow rate is varied zdravkovich et al 1989 conducted experiments to investigate the drag force of short cylinders containing hemispherical ends for the ratio of the length to the diameter l d ranging from 1 to 10 and for re number ranging from 6 104 to 2 6 105 the drag coefficient decreases with the flat ended cylinders as the aspect ratio is reduced to 6 but the drag coefficient hardly changes for l d 6 for the hemispherical ended cylinder the drag coefficient decreases further as l d is reduced to unity flows past wall mounted prisms and cylinders have been investigated aiming to evaluate the vortical structures and the hydrodynamic loading characteristics with the presence of free ends studies in this area typically defined the reynolds number based on the prism width d and the aspect ratio ar h d where h represents the height of the prism mcclean and sumner 2014 studied the influence of the aspect ratio and the incidence angle on the hydrodynamic loadings at re 7 3 104 at the zero incidence angle the mean value of the drag coefficient decreased from 1 46 to 1 29 as the aspect ratio is reduced from 11 to 3 they stated that the possible reason for the drag reduction as the three dimensional downwash induced by the prism s free ends the influence of the aspect ratio on the near wake flow structures was investigated by wang and zhou 2009 they demonstrated that the interference among the plate tip and base vortices is dominant at the aspect ratio of less than 3 the results obtained by rostamy et al 2012 suggest that the size of the vortices appearing downstream of the plate near the free end is correlated to the aspect ratio of the plate the plate with a smaller aspect ratio created larger eddies the turbulent flow induced by the free end becomes effective in the large portion of the cylinder having a high aspect ratio wang and zhou 2009 fox and west 1993a and fox and west 1993b observed the noticeable influence of free ends on the vortex structures in the wake of a circular cylinder for an aspect ratio of 30 sumner 2013 conducted an extensive review for flow past wall mounted free end cylinder and concluded that the volume of research done on the area is not sufficient he reported that the influence of aspect ratio is not fully understood because most of the previous studies in the literature have been concentrated on low aspect ratio ar 2 and there is a need to study higher ar various vortex detection methods have been used to characterize turbulent flow fields the coherent structure is an approach that was developed for identifying dynamic vortices in turbulent flows the definition of the coherent structure can be prescribed as a turbulent mixing region associated with a fluid movement that is characterized by a lower level of motion than the estimated level correlated with the known velocity field this behavior indicates that such fluid mass is exhibiting a coherent characteristic over a specific window of time hussain 1981 1986 although the vortex detection and visualization attract a considerable amount of interest in the field of fluid dynamics a direct and overt definition of a vortex is still an open question rockwood et al 2018 a general agreement regarding the extent to which the vortex edges can spread from the vortex center of rotation is not available lugt 1979 haller et al 2016 additionally a precise threshold that can be used to define the vortical intensity is also hard to be determined haller 2005 2015 the definition of the vortex will be more difficult for turbulent multiphase flows past an object in the proximity of a free surface eulerian methods widely used vortex identification techniques utilize the instantaneous velocity field and its gradient to acquire coherent structures jeong and hussain 1995 graftieaux et al 2001 even though the eulerian methods have been used broadly in vortex dominated turbulent flows they have several issues green et al 2010 as an example eulerian methods are variant with respect to time dependent rotations of the reference frame and thus they are not objective haller 2005 moreover eulerian techniques require the use of a user defined threshold to reveal the regions embodying coherent structures the г1 criterion graftieaux et al 2001 q criterion hunt et al 1988 and λ 2 criterion jeong and hussain 1995 are among widely used eulerian methods to identify coherent structures the lagrangian method suggested by haller 2005 and further described by shadden et al 2005 can identify coherent structures relying on the flow properties along the trajectories of tracer fluid particles one of the advantages of the lagrangian method is the objectivity since lagrangian coherent structures are independent of the reference frame of rotation another advantage of the lagrangian method is that lagrangian coherent structures are relatively insensitive to the anomalies in the velocity field input data as long as the anomalies remain spatially and temporarily localized kumar et al 2018 green et al 2007 peacock and dabiri 2010 the primary objective of this study is to characterize turbulent flow structures and hydrodynamic loadings in multiphase flows past a plate with free ends in the vicinity of a free surface the plate of interest in this study is potentially a part of linear energy harvesting devices which is usually installed using large platforms in the river system these devices comprise of blades translating inside the water streams to the best knowledge of present authors the effects of prism aspect ratio on the vortex dynamics and hydrodynamic loadings have not been studied in turbulent flows past a prism with free ends in the proximity of a free surface vortex identification methods including the eulerian q criterion fields and the lagrangian ftle fields are used to visualize the flow field the numerical simulations are conducted using the volume of fluid vof and the high fidelity turbulence model large eddy simulations les the validation of the mathematical model and the numerical methods are performed using the previous experimental observations 2 mathematical modeling 2 1 the vof multiphase model the volume of fluid vof is implemented to simulate multiphase flows the vof model is a surface tracking approach that is suitable to tackle complex flows involving stratified fluids or immiscible fluids with the presence of an interface a single set of momentum equations is shared by the phases and the volume fraction of each phase in computational mesh cells is tracked throughout the flow domain a scalar function defines the volume fraction of the gas phase α g which represents the gas volume divided by the local cell volume the value of the volume fraction is bounded between 0 α g 1 α g 0 limit corresponds to the liquid filled cells and α g 1 limit corresponds to the gas filled cells for 0 α g 1 the computational cell contains the interface between the gas and liquid phase here α g is given by 1 α g g cell g g l where cell represents the cell volume g represents the volume of gas inside the cell and l represents the liquid volume inside the cell the multiphase mass and momentum equations are written as hirt and nichols 1981 monaghan 1994 2 ρ t ρ u 0 3 ρ u t ρ u u p τ μ ρ g where u is the phase velocity ρ is the density τ μ is the viscous stress tensor p is the pressure and g is the gravitational acceleration the mixture density is defined in terms of the density and volume fraction of phases as 4 ρ k g l ρ k α k here ρ g represents the gas phase density and ρ l represents the liquid phase density the tracking of the interface between the liquid and gas phase is achieved by solving the continuity equation for the volume fraction of the gas phase 5 t α g ρ g α g ρ g u g m lg where u g is the velocity of the gas phase and m lg is the mass transfer from the liquid phase to the gas phase in the present study the vof model is used for the air water free surface flows without the mass transfer between stratified air and water therefore m lg in eq 5 is set to zero 3 computational overview the schematic of the computational domain for three dimensional flows past a finite plate is illustrated in fig 1 a the gray plane indicates the initial location of the undisturbed free surface the plane separates the air region from the water region as shown in fig 1 a the plate geometry the length width and height l w and d are shown in fig 1 b the length to height ratio l d of the plate used in this study is 2 5 5 and 10 fig 1 c illustrates the side view of the computational domain the origin of the computational domain is located at the center of the plate the plate is located at 12d from the inlet 23d from the outlet 4d from the top surface and 8d from the bottom wall the computational domain size varies in the z direction as l d is varied this variation is imposed to maintain a constant distance of 3d from the plate side tip to the side wall simulations are conducted for the water depth d of 0 015m which corresponds to fr number of 1 30 the froude number is defined as f r u g d where d is the distance between the free surface and the plate top surface examining the data reported by the u s geological survey for river freestream velocities only 51 0 of the river systems in the united states have velocities suitable for hydrokinetic turbine operation taking a velocity range from 0 75 m s to 2 5 m s riglin et al 2015 in the case of linear energy harvester which comprises of multiple translating plates moving below the free surface the operation speed can be lower than this range attiya et al 2017 hence in order to mimic the natural setting of this type of applications the uniform streamwise component of the velocity at the inlet is set 0 5 m s for the water and 0 01 m s for the air reynolds number re ρu water d μ based on the inlet water velocity u w a t e r and the plate height d is 50 000 here ρ is the density and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the water the characteristic length used to calculate reynolds number was taken to be the plate height d normal to the flow direction in multiple previous studies for flows past objects the object fixed width was taken as a characteristic length when it comes to the reynolds number calculations instead of the hydraulic diameter saha et al 2003 sohankar 2008 taira and colonius 2009 it is important to emphasize the significance of the blockage ratio on these flows in the flow studied here the largest blockage ratio is about 5 previous studies have shown that for blockage ratios less than 5 there is no significant effect on the pressure distribution and the drag coefficient west and apelt 1982 sohankar et al 1998 kolekar and banerjee 2015 aghsaee and markfort 2018 the zero pressure gradient is imposed at the outlet and the no slip boundary condition is imposed at the plate surface the top and bottom surface of the computational domain the periodic boundary condition is imposed at the side surfaces of the computational domain the geometric and physical parameters used in this study are listed in table 1 the simulations are conducted by utilizing the open source computational fluid dynamics cfd software package open field operation and manipulation openfoam the interfoam vof solver designed for two phase incompressible isothermal and immiscible fluids is employed to capture the interface between the water and the air accurately the main advantage of the interfoam solver is the usage of the multi dimensional universal limiter for explicit solution mules method which is a very effective method to ensure the boundedness of each phase fraction in a way that is independent of underlying numerical scheme and mesh structure openfoam 2018 the transient solver pimplefoam is used for the pressure velocity coupling by utilizing pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm the adjustable time step based on a specified courant number is adopted to enhance the numerical stability of the simulation the second order time discretization crank nicolson is implemented for the temporal discretization moreover the discretization methods used for laplacian gradient interpolation and divergence are gauss linear limited gauss linear linear and gauss linear respectively the vof equation is discretized using the second order gauss vanleer scheme detailed descriptions of the discretization methods can be found in greenshields 2015 in order to control the iterative process used by the transient solver pimplefoam two criteria are implemented to evaluate the temporal convergence the first one is achieved by monitoring the residuals for the iterative process implemented within the solver to solve the continuity momentum and volume fraction equations the second criterion is imposed by monitoring the time evolution of the drag and the lift coefficient the simulations are considered converged when the residuals reached the preset threshold value and when the drag and lift show a quasi periodic state the threshold is set 10 8 for the volume fraction 10 8 for the velocity and 10 6 for the pressure the computational domain consists of subdomains discretized by the nested structured mesh and connected by non conformal interfaces as shown in fig 2 the meshing approach provides more flexibility in controlling the refinement around the plate and the free surface the mesh is refined in the regions near the plate and the free surface as shown in fig 2 b the cell size is increased gradually away from the plate and the free surface 4 validation and spatial convergence study 4 1 validation the mathematical model and the numerical method employed are validated using experimental data reported by malavasi and guadagnini 2007 flows past a rectangular cylinder placed beneath a free surface are considered for the validation study the detailed description of the geometry and the computational domain are depicted in fig 3 the cylinder is fully submerged in the water with a depth of h where h h h b s predicted results by les vof models in the three dimensional geometry are compared to the measured results for re 3 68 104 h 2 and h b s 2 33 we tested four subgrid scale sgs models in the validation study against the experimental data 1 the one equation eddy viscosity keqn 2 the dynamic one equation eddy viscosity dynamickeqn 3 the smagorinsky and 4 the wall adapting local eddy viscosity wale the details of the sgs models used in this study are described in the supplements the free surface deformations predicted by each of the used sgs models matched well with those reported by malavasi and guadagnini 2007 see fig 6 of the reference however a noticeable discrepancy is observed in the drag and lift coefficient reported by the experiment and predicted by the les sgs models the drag and lift coefficients are defined b c d f d 1 2 ρ u 2 a y and c l f l 1 2 ρ u 2 a where f d is the drag force f l is the lift force and a is the projected area of the plate perpendicular to the oncoming flow the drag and lift coefficient is 2 78 and 7 65 measured 2 27 and 6 70 predicted by smagorinsky 2 28 and 6 62 by keqn 2 40 and 7 2 by dynamic keqn and 2 45 and 7 2 by wale the wale and the dynamickeqn both predict hydrodynamic loadings on the cylinder more accurately compared to other sgs models the wale model is selected here because the cpu time used for each time step is 7 s compared to 10 s in the case of dynamickeqn a larger number of iterations required for the convergence at each time step for the dynamickeqn model sohankar 2014 the contours of the vorticity in the water domain and the contours of the water volume fraction are illustrated in fig 4 we compared the predicted results by wale sgs model against the experimental observation regarding the behavior of air entrainment into the water the free surface deformations and the location where the surface drops down at the trailing edge of the rectangular cylinder see fig 6 in malavasi and guadagnini 2007 the free surface dynamics predicted agree very well with measurements fig 5 depicts the time signature of the drag and lift coefficient the negative value of the lift coefficient is a result of the negative suction pressure produced by the flow separation that mostly occurred on the lower portion of the square cylinder the vortex shedding from the top portion of the cylinder is suppressed by the proximity of the free surface strouhal number calculated is 0 2 which agrees reasonably well with that reported in malavasi and guadagnini 2007 the results of the validation study demonstrate that the les vof model and the numerical method utilized can accurately simulate the complex turbulent flows studied here 4 2 spatial convergence study we next present the results of the mesh independence study multiphase simulations are conducted using the vof les turbulence model for flows past the plate with the length to height ratio l d of 5 the mesh density of n 1 3 106 cells n 2 7 106 cells and n 3 14 106 cells are used to calculate the drag and lift coefficient each mesh includes two nested mesh blocks an outer block mainly in the air region and far away from the plate toward the bottom of the domain and an inner block around the plate and in the wake region this approach allows a higher refinement in region of interest while using a coarser mesh in the others see fig 2 the number of grids used in the two nested mesh blocks for the three different meshes are 363 156 and 226 for n 1 408 186 and 326 for n 2 and finally 526 236 and 424 for n 3 in the x y and z directions respectively the structured mesh minimum cell size implemented in the current study close to the plate surface for each of the three meshes n 1 n 2 and n 3 is 0 8 mm 0 5 mm and 0 3 mm respectively all the three meshes have a maximum cell size of 3 mm located in the regions close to the outlet of the domain within the outer mesh block the distribution of the mesh is implemented in a way that concentrate the refinement around the plate and close to the free surface bias factor of 4 is applied in the structured mesh to control the mesh expansion away from the surface of the plate in both the x and y direction while a constant division spacing is applied in the z direction without any bias factor the time signature of the drag coefficient obtained by n 1 n 2 and n 3 is shown in fig 6 as a function of the non dimensional time λ tu water d the mean y value along the plate surface the mean and maximum value of the courant number and the mean and root mean square value of the predicted drag and lift coefficient for n 1 and n 2 and n 3 are tabulated in table 2 the difference in the time averaged drag and lift coefficient is 3 98 and 3 5 between n 1 and n 2 and 2 2 and 1 1 between n 2 and n 3 the root mean square and standard deviation of drag and lift coefficient obtained by n2 and n3 are also similar the mean y value decreases from 5 16 for n 1 to 1 45 for n 3 along the wall of the plate which corresponds to a decrease in the first layer thickness as the mesh density is increased considering the limitation of the computational resources the results presented in this paper are obtained using the mesh density of n 2 the profiles of the time averaged streamwise component of the velocity acquired at downstream locations of the plate 1d 3d and 5d away from the center of the plate see fig 7 a using the mesh density of n 1 n 2 and n 3 are depicted in fig 7 the velocity profiles obtained using n 2 7 106 and n 3 14 106 cells are similar while the profiles obtained using n 1 differs slightly it is demonstrated here that the mesh density n 2 ensures spatial convergence 5 results and discussion simulations are conducted for three dimensional multiphase flows past a finite plate beneath a free surface with a depth of 0 15d corresponding to fr number of 1 30 and re 50 000 a plate length of 2 5d 5d and 10d are considered for simulations utilizing the vof les with the wale sgs turbulence model the profiles of the time averaged streamwise component of the velocity along the crossflow direction acquired at various upstream and downstream locations are shown in fig 8 upstream of the plate there is a negative spike in the velocity above the upper edge of the plate indicative of a recirculating vortex the value of the spike is greater for the geometry with smaller l d while it is very small for wider l d values the negative spike occurs inside the thin shear layer attached to the top surface at the location corresponding to the bottom edge of the plate there is a positive spike in the velocity that increases with l d which highlights the jet like flow structure around the corner of the plate further along the upstream direction the profiles are similar in all geometries reverse flow is observed in all cases at the upper part of the plate while the jet like flow is observed at the lower part of the plate further away from the plate both toward the free surface or the bottom wall uniform velocity profiles are recovered downstream of the plate the velocity profiles still show the negative spike characteristic of a recirculating vortex however the location of the vortex is now in the center of the plate the profiles also show the generation of large scale eddies that increase in magnitude with l d between the free surface and the top of the plate jet like flow is observed in all geometries with greater intensity for l d of 10 further away from the plate the free shear layer velocity profiles are recovered the recovery of the shear layer occurs in a shorter distance from the plate for l d of 2 5 the velocity profiles near the free surface are different than that at a deeper location away from the interface at both upstream and downstream locations fig 9 depicts the instantaneous vorticity for l d of 2 5 5 and 10 at z 0 and y 0 planes upstream of the plate there is a shear layer attached to the free surface this layer has an important role in vortex shedding interactions with submerged bodies patel et al 1984 as l d increases from 2 5 the shear layer separates from the free surface and hairpin like vortices erupted from the free surface and impinge on the plate the magnitude of the upstream vorticity near the plate increases with l d as seen in fig 9 b tip vortices shed from side surfaces of the plate generate eddies as l d increases the back surface of the plate is exposed to air due to the deflection of the free surface near the vicinity of the plate immediately downstream of the top surface of the plate as shown through the contours in fig 9 there is a high vortical activity this is reduced as l d increases because as previously mentioned the plate surface becomes exposed to air and thus cannot aid in vortex shedding and generation from the top surface this causes vortex shedding to occur mainly from the bottom surface of the plate tip vortices generated from the sides of the plate interact with the karman vortex shedding generated from the top and bottom surface of the plate in all flows a similar decrease in vortex activity is observed in the immediate region downstream from the center of the plate although it is caused by a different phenomenon as l d increases the tip vortices could not penetrate to the center of the plate which reduces vortical activity in the center region as shown in fig 9 the plate length has a strong influence on the levels of interaction between the tip vortices and those shed from the top and bottom surface of the plate the flow images also show the vortex shedding and dissipation downstream of the plate lagrangian coherent structures lcs and eulerian q criterion are calculated to track the evolution of the vorticity in complex turbulence flows lcss images are obtained from the ridges of finite time lyapunov exponent ftle fields shadden et al 2005 while the q criterion represents the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor used to characterize vortex concentration the q criterion is defined as q 0 5 s 2 ω 2 where s is the strain tensor and ω represents the rotation tensor additional information is provided by hunt et al 1988 the details of the procedure identifying lcs are described in a section of the supplement both lcs and eulerian q criterion show the complex flow behaviors associated with the free surface structure interaction the eulerian and lagrangian vortex identification methods reveal similar flow structures but lcs identifies the evolution and the interaction of vortices better the reason for this difference is related to the arbitrary threshold used in the q criterion users specify arbitrary threshold values to detect the vortex cores and that would change the spatial distribution of vortices fig 10 depicts the eulerian and lagrangian flow images with a plate l d of 2 5 and 5 contours of the q criterion and lcs are rendered at the z 0 plane the coherent structures mainly concentrate close to the free surface and at the near wake of the plate brighter images of the ftle fields indicate higher intensities for lcs implying higher turbulent activities the free surface presence inhibits the formation of large scale shedding yet it allows for the formation of small kelvin helmholtz like vortical instabilities generated from the free surface see fig 10 b d there is a high concentration of small scale vortices near the free surface within a thin layer upstream of the plate the shear layer attached to the free surface interacts with the upper tip of the plate and in the case of the plate with higher aspect ratio the vortices generated from the shear layer roll into the bottom of the plate the hairpin like vortices formed from the free surface above the plate and vorticity generated from the top side of the plate interact with each other for the plate length of 2 5d the region near the front face of the plate lacks vortical activities fig 11 depicts the contours of the q criterion and lcs for l d of 5 at various height intervals from the top to the bottom surface of the plate 5 y d 5 the ftle field is the brightest for images rendered near the surface y 0 5 d plane and the intensity of the ftle field is reduced gradually for images acquired further away from the free surface images at the left and the right column denote the q criterion and lcs respectively the eulerian and lagrangian images rendered at the top surface of the plate demonstrate that the flow fields near the plate are strongly influenced by the presence of the free surface there are layers of rolling vortices observed in the region upstream of the plate these vortices wrap around the plate and interact with the tip vortices causing high intensity small eddies generation in the near wake region of the plate the vortex rolls generated from the free surface dissipate in the cross flow direction the region upstream of the plate at the depth y 0 5d has little or no vortical activities as depicted in fig 11 the flow images shown in fig s1 for l d 2 5 reveal similar characteristics with an exception that there are weaker vortical activities in the region near the front face of the plate at any depth at the plane y d 0 5 further away from the surface vortex shedding patterns are more regular in both geometries the flow structures presented here will influence the pressure coefficient at the front and back face of the plate and command the drag and lift signatures of the plate as presented below it is demonstrated here that the eulerian and the lagrangian vortex identification tools can be utilized together to characterize the flow field effectively although the q criterion contours might lack some details due to their instantaneous nature the flow patterns revealed by the eulerian and lagrangian method match well the eulerian and lagrangian flow images are complementary to each other in describing the turbulent flow fields three dimensional flow images of iso surfaces of the q criterion for l d of 2 5 5 and 10 shown in fig s2 underscore the features of the turbulent flow patterns revealed by the eulerian and lagrangian coherent structure contours figs 9 figs 10 and 11 the hairpin like vortices burst from the free surface upstream of the plate and impinge on the plate for l d of 5 and 10 these vortices are not present in the geometry with l d of 2 5 it is also noticed that the near wake flow field is dominated by vortices generated by the plate while the far wake flow field is dominated by rolling vortices generated from the free surface the interaction of the free surface and the plate creates turbulent flows with spatial and temporal characteristics that are strongly dependent on the plate length the thin shear layer attached to the free surface is one source of the vorticity generation mechanism as reported by cetiner and rockwell 2001 the surface deformation and the induced small scale vortex structures are highly influenced by the plate geometry and the froude number in the present study the froude number is fixed while the plate geometry is varied the presence of the plate will alter and disturb the velocity profiles upstream of the plate see fig 8 two distinct vortex sheddings occur a shedding from the thin vorticity layer attached to the free surface and a shedding from the plate itself the evolution and interaction of these vortices generate complex velocity fields which are influenced by the plate length instantaneous contours of the water volume fraction for l d of 2 5 5 and 10 are depicted in fig 12 the water volume fraction of unity represents the cell filled with the water and of zero represents the cell filled with the air generally air entrainment happens as a result of surface deformations that are caused by the hydraulic jump fig 12 shows that entrainment is maximized at l d of 2 5 and decreases as the aspect ratio increases there is also free surface deflection at each l d where the hydraulic jump is largest at an l d of 10 the intensity of hydraulic jump increases as l d increases and the jump occurs closer to the plate with an increasing l d as a result of hydraulic jump the back of the normally submerged plate is exposed to air for l d of 5 and 10 further downstream where the flow is less affected by the plate the free surface eventually rebounds to an undisturbed level the level of surface deflection and the distance where the surface rebounds to the undisturbed level increase as l d increases fig 13 shows the distribution of reynolds normal stress u u profiles in the crossflow direction at various upstream and downstream locations the reynold stress is a measure of the turbulent intensity of the flow in the upstream region the reynolds stress assumes a maximum value near the plate s top surface and then decreases to zero near the bottom of the plate the rapid decay of the peak highlights the kelvin helmholtz vortices close to the plate and as l d increases the magnitude of the peak stress increases after 1d in the streamwise direction the reynolds stresses do not change with x d and reach a constant value because far away from the plate the thin free shear layer maintains vortical activities and turbulent intensity downstream of the plate in the wake region there are two peaks present in the reynolds profiles both of which have a greater magnitude than the upstream stresses the first peak corresponds to the strong interaction of the vortices generated from the top and free surface this peak rapidly falls off along the streamwise direction implying stationary vortical activity as well as significant free surface damping in the streamwise direction the second peak is found at the bottom surface of the plate where karman vortices are shed as the streamwise direction is increased there is a shift in the intensity between the two peaks where the second peak becomes larger than the first due to the damping of turbulent activity downstream top of the plate the second bottom surface peak increases in the streamwise direction highlighting that the vortices shed from the bottom surface remain strong in between the two peaks there is a zone in the middle of the plate with lower turbulent intensity showing little vortical activity in that region as l d is increased the value of all peaks increase and the peaks decay slower it is also noted that the elevated reynolds stress at downstream of the plate is observed on a wider crossflow range than upstream due to strong turbulent activities in the wake region as the streamwise distance increases the reynolds stress profile becomes more uniform implying that mixing is taking place and the turbulent flow is becoming more homogenous the time signatures of the drag and lift coefficient c d c l for l d of 2 5 5 and 10 are depicted in fig 14 the mean drag coefficient averaged for 300 000 time steps or 15 s for the plate length of 2 5d 5d and 10d is calculated to be 1 88 1 79 and 1 73 respectively the standard deviations of the drag coefficient signals are determined to be 0 058 0 11 and 0 12 respectively indicating that the amplitude of pressure fluctuation increases as plate length is increased this is because the larger portion of the back face of the plate is exposed to the air for longer plates creating more irregular flow dynamics note that the plate length of 2 5d has the highest c d because of the lack of vortical activities in front of the plate the higher pressure difference between the front and back surfaces of the plate results in a higher c d plate length of 10d has the lowest c d because the population of the small and large eddies in the region near upstream of the plate is the greatest for the longer plate the pressure contours along the front and back face of the plate with l d of 2 5 5 and 10 validate the predictions of the drag coefficient the pressure acting on the front face of the plate is the highest for l d of 2 5 as seen in fig s3 with an increase of vortical activities in the front of the plate as the length is increased the pressure acting on the front face decreases resulting in the lower drag coefficient the time averaged value of the lift coefficient is positive in all geometries and it is greater for l d of 2 5 than that for l d of 5 and 10 the positive value of the lift coefficient refers to as the plate is pulled toward the free surface the non zero values of the lift coefficient are results of the induced asymmetry in the flow by the presence of the free surface the lift forces are sensitive to the free surface plate interaction and the flow asymmetry as reported by malavasi and guadagnini 2007 the time averaged pressure coefficient c p acquired at the central vertical plane z 0 of the plate at the front back top and bottom surface is examined the mean pressure coefficient is defined as 6 c p p m e a n p s ρ g h where p s is the hydrostatic pressure evaluated by the simulated water level the pressure coefficient profiles of the shorter plates are similar while the longer plate has a different pressure distribution as shown in fig s4 a similar trend can be seen in the pressure contours rendered in fig s3 more importantly the pressure difference between the front and the back surface which mainly determines the drag coefficient of the plate is lower for the longer plate compared to the shorter plates this explains that the longer plate has a lower drag coefficient value it is also worth mentioning that the air entrainment and the plate exposure to the air cause lower pressure on the rear surface of the longer plates see fig 8 and fig 9 fig s4 shows the distribution of the pressure coefficient on the top and bottom surface the flow field in the vicinity of the top and the bottom surface displays diverse characteristics due to the presence of the free surface the pressure acting on the bottom surface is the highest for the shortest plate and it decreases monotonically as the plate length is increased in each geometry the pressure acting on the top surface is similar and the pressure difference between the bottom and the top surface is positive at any x location indicating that the lift force exerted on the plate is in the direction toward the free surface 6 conclusions the volume of fluid vof and les turbulence model were utilized to simulate multiphase flows flows past a submerged plate in the proximity of a free surface were considered for l d of 2 5 5 and 10 at the fixed fr number of 1 30 and re number of 50 000 as the aspect ratio increases the free surface behavior will change and impact vortex dynamics and hydrodynamic loadings the mathematical models and numerical methods employed were validated using the experimental work of malavasi and guadagnini 2007 the eulerian and lagrangian methods were utilized to show three different sources of vorticity hairpin like vortices from the shear layer karman and tip vortices from plates edges all interact with each other in the wake while there were no significant vortical activities in the region upstream of the plate for l d of 2 5 for l d of 5 and 10 near the free surface hairpin like vortices erupt from the interface and impinge on the front face of the plate as l d increases the karman vortex shedding from the top surface of the plate is suppressed due to proximity to free surface at all l d there is a hydraulic jump in the system exposing the back of the plate to air the location of the jump is occurring closer to the plate as with l d is increasing and at 5 and 10 the jump occurs at the plate exposing the back surface to air as l d is increasing there is significant deformation in the free surface upstream of the plate enough to entrain air in that region the velocity profiles reflect the vortical activity generated near the vicinity of the plate upstream turbulent intensity increases with l d due to the erupting hairpin like vortices impinging on the plate but away from the plate there is no change in the distribution near downstream of the plate there are strong turbulent activities near the plate and the free surface which could be dampened further downstream at the bottom of the plate karman and hairpin vortices shed from the shear layer interact and expand further downwards as well as intensify before dissipating in further downstream the drag coefficient decreases slightly as the aspect ratio l d is increased the vortical activities near the front face of the plate were likely to be the reason for the drag reduction in the longer plates representing an important manifestation of the plate length on the pressure differential the lift without the hydrostatic effects was positive for all geometries considered implying that the plate is pulled toward the free surface the positive lift coefficient results from the high speed free shear layer observed near the top surface of the plate we observed that the lift coefficient was the greatest for the l d of 2 5 the current study provides a discussion on the interaction between the length of the plate and the vortical structures generated with different aspect ratios this offers a first step toward the understanding of the influence of such phenomenon on the performance of the offshore structures hydraulic devices when operating in the proximity of free surfaces this influence needs to be addressed and taken into account in the design processes of such devices acknowledgment this work used the extreme science and engineering discovery environment xsede supported by national science

22587,simulations have been conducted to quantify the effects of aspect ratio on the lift and drag coefficient for a finite plate near a free surface large eddy simulations using a vof multiphase model were conducted for a plate length to height aspect ratio of 2 5 5 and 10 for a reynolds number of 50 000 and a froude number of 1 3 eulerian and lagrangian coherent structures were employed to characterize the turbulent flow fields as the aspect ratio increases the mean drag coefficient decreases from 1 88 to 1 73 this is due to an increase in vortex activity caused by separation of the free shear layer at l d of 5 and 10 both the upstream and downstream region are affected by the hairpin like vortices generated from the bursting of the free shear layer with increasing plate length karman vortex shedding from the face near the free surface is suppressed and the influence of tip vortices on the near wake flow is reduced the aspect ratio has a strong influence on the free surface

practical importance in many engineering applications marine current energy harvesting devices and offshore structures such as hydropower systems platforms and pipelines regularly interact with free surfaces simulating free surface flows is a challenging task since the location of the free surface changes continuously interactions between the free surface and the object alter the flow field and the hydrodynamic loadings understanding the fluid structure interaction in flows past objects placed in the vicinity of free surfaces is essential for designing hydraulic devices operating in rivers lakes and oceans flows past objects in the proximity of a free surface have drawn increasing attention lately free surface deformation vortex shedding and hydrodynamic forces acting on a body have been investigated sheridan et al 1997 and malavasi and guadagnini 2007 conducted experiments for flows past a circular rectangular cylinder beneath a free surface at various depths as the cylinder is placed closer to the surface larger surface distortion is observed and large scale vortices are suppressed the mean force coefficients and vortex shedding frequency are strongly influenced by the asymmetric flow patterns at shallow depths liu et al 2016 numerically studied flows past a normal plate near a free surface in two dimensional geometries asymmetric vortex shedding and an increase in strouhal number are observed as the plate depth is decreased reichl et al 2005 numerically investigated flows past a cylinder close to a free surface and reported the suppression of vortex shedding and substantial surface deformations at high froude number fr flows riglin et al 2015 conducted computational fluid dynamics simulations for a hydrokinetic turbine operating near a free surface they showed that the generated mechanical power is reduced significantly as the hydrokinetic turbine operates near a free surface karim et al 2014 and prasad et al 2015 carried out simulations for free surface flows over a shallowly submerged hydrofoil they discovered that the drag coefficient increases as the submergence depth decreases in their studies a wave breaking phenomena is observed at small submergence depths flows past an object with free ends display complex flow structures which are strongly dependent on the aspect ratio of the plate the present study utilizes the eulerian and lagrangian vortex identification methods to characterize turbulent flows past a plate for various values of the aspect ratio the hydrodynamic loadings on the plate in the proximity of a free surface are studied inoue and sakuragi 2008 investigated the effect of the ratio of span length to diameter of the cylinder l d on wake flow structures and reported various shedding patterns as the flow rate is varied zdravkovich et al 1989 conducted experiments to investigate the drag force of short cylinders containing hemispherical ends for the ratio of the length to the diameter l d ranging from 1 to 10 and for re number ranging from 6 104 to 2 6 105 the drag coefficient decreases with the flat ended cylinders as the aspect ratio is reduced to 6 but the drag coefficient hardly changes for l d 6 for the hemispherical ended cylinder the drag coefficient decreases further as l d is reduced to unity flows past wall mounted prisms and cylinders have been investigated aiming to evaluate the vortical structures and the hydrodynamic loading characteristics with the presence of free ends studies in this area typically defined the reynolds number based on the prism width d and the aspect ratio ar h d where h represents the height of the prism mcclean and sumner 2014 studied the influence of the aspect ratio and the incidence angle on the hydrodynamic loadings at re 7 3 104 at the zero incidence angle the mean value of the drag coefficient decreased from 1 46 to 1 29 as the aspect ratio is reduced from 11 to 3 they stated that the possible reason for the drag reduction as the three dimensional downwash induced by the prism s free ends the influence of the aspect ratio on the near wake flow structures was investigated by wang and zhou 2009 they demonstrated that the interference among the plate tip and base vortices is dominant at the aspect ratio of less than 3 the results obtained by rostamy et al 2012 suggest that the size of the vortices appearing downstream of the plate near the free end is correlated to the aspect ratio of the plate the plate with a smaller aspect ratio created larger eddies the turbulent flow induced by the free end becomes effective in the large portion of the cylinder having a high aspect ratio wang and zhou 2009 fox and west 1993a and fox and west 1993b observed the noticeable influence of free ends on the vortex structures in the wake of a circular cylinder for an aspect ratio of 30 sumner 2013 conducted an extensive review for flow past wall mounted free end cylinder and concluded that the volume of research done on the area is not sufficient he reported that the influence of aspect ratio is not fully understood because most of the previous studies in the literature have been concentrated on low aspect ratio ar 2 and there is a need to study higher ar various vortex detection methods have been used to characterize turbulent flow fields the coherent structure is an approach that was developed for identifying dynamic vortices in turbulent flows the definition of the coherent structure can be prescribed as a turbulent mixing region associated with a fluid movement that is characterized by a lower level of motion than the estimated level correlated with the known velocity field this behavior indicates that such fluid mass is exhibiting a coherent characteristic over a specific window of time hussain 1981 1986 although the vortex detection and visualization attract a considerable amount of interest in the field of fluid dynamics a direct and overt definition of a vortex is still an open question rockwood et al 2018 a general agreement regarding the extent to which the vortex edges can spread from the vortex center of rotation is not available lugt 1979 haller et al 2016 additionally a precise threshold that can be used to define the vortical intensity is also hard to be determined haller 2005 2015 the definition of the vortex will be more difficult for turbulent multiphase flows past an object in the proximity of a free surface eulerian methods widely used vortex identification techniques utilize the instantaneous velocity field and its gradient to acquire coherent structures jeong and hussain 1995 graftieaux et al 2001 even though the eulerian methods have been used broadly in vortex dominated turbulent flows they have several issues green et al 2010 as an example eulerian methods are variant with respect to time dependent rotations of the reference frame and thus they are not objective haller 2005 moreover eulerian techniques require the use of a user defined threshold to reveal the regions embodying coherent structures the г1 criterion graftieaux et al 2001 q criterion hunt et al 1988 and λ 2 criterion jeong and hussain 1995 are among widely used eulerian methods to identify coherent structures the lagrangian method suggested by haller 2005 and further described by shadden et al 2005 can identify coherent structures relying on the flow properties along the trajectories of tracer fluid particles one of the advantages of the lagrangian method is the objectivity since lagrangian coherent structures are independent of the reference frame of rotation another advantage of the lagrangian method is that lagrangian coherent structures are relatively insensitive to the anomalies in the velocity field input data as long as the anomalies remain spatially and temporarily localized kumar et al 2018 green et al 2007 peacock and dabiri 2010 the primary objective of this study is to characterize turbulent flow structures and hydrodynamic loadings in multiphase flows past a plate with free ends in the vicinity of a free surface the plate of interest in this study is potentially a part of linear energy harvesting devices which is usually installed using large platforms in the river system these devices comprise of blades translating inside the water streams to the best knowledge of present authors the effects of prism aspect ratio on the vortex dynamics and hydrodynamic loadings have not been studied in turbulent flows past a prism with free ends in the proximity of a free surface vortex identification methods including the eulerian q criterion fields and the lagrangian ftle fields are used to visualize the flow field the numerical simulations are conducted using the volume of fluid vof and the high fidelity turbulence model large eddy simulations les the validation of the mathematical model and the numerical methods are performed using the previous experimental observations 2 mathematical modeling 2 1 the vof multiphase model the volume of fluid vof is implemented to simulate multiphase flows the vof model is a surface tracking approach that is suitable to tackle complex flows involving stratified fluids or immiscible fluids with the presence of an interface a single set of momentum equations is shared by the phases and the volume fraction of each phase in computational mesh cells is tracked throughout the flow domain a scalar function defines the volume fraction of the gas phase α g which represents the gas volume divided by the local cell volume the value of the volume fraction is bounded between 0 α g 1 α g 0 limit corresponds to the liquid filled cells and α g 1 limit corresponds to the gas filled cells for 0 α g 1 the computational cell contains the interface between the gas and liquid phase here α g is given by 1 α g g cell g g l where cell represents the cell volume g represents the volume of gas inside the cell and l represents the liquid volume inside the cell the multiphase mass and momentum equations are written as hirt and nichols 1981 monaghan 1994 2 ρ t ρ u 0 3 ρ u t ρ u u p τ μ ρ g where u is the phase velocity ρ is the density τ μ is the viscous stress tensor p is the pressure and g is the gravitational acceleration the mixture density is defined in terms of the density and volume fraction of phases as 4 ρ k g l ρ k α k here ρ g represents the gas phase density and ρ l represents the liquid phase density the tracking of the interface between the liquid and gas phase is achieved by solving the continuity equation for the volume fraction of the gas phase 5 t α g ρ g α g ρ g u g m lg where u g is the velocity of the gas phase and m lg is the mass transfer from the liquid phase to the gas phase in the present study the vof model is used for the air water free surface flows without the mass transfer between stratified air and water therefore m lg in eq 5 is set to zero 3 computational overview the schematic of the computational domain for three dimensional flows past a finite plate is illustrated in fig 1 a the gray plane indicates the initial location of the undisturbed free surface the plane separates the air region from the water region as shown in fig 1 a the plate geometry the length width and height l w and d are shown in fig 1 b the length to height ratio l d of the plate used in this study is 2 5 5 and 10 fig 1 c illustrates the side view of the computational domain the origin of the computational domain is located at the center of the plate the plate is located at 12d from the inlet 23d from the outlet 4d from the top surface and 8d from the bottom wall the computational domain size varies in the z direction as l d is varied this variation is imposed to maintain a constant distance of 3d from the plate side tip to the side wall simulations are conducted for the water depth d of 0 015m which corresponds to fr number of 1 30 the froude number is defined as f r u g d where d is the distance between the free surface and the plate top surface examining the data reported by the u s geological survey for river freestream velocities only 51 0 of the river systems in the united states have velocities suitable for hydrokinetic turbine operation taking a velocity range from 0 75 m s to 2 5 m s riglin et al 2015 in the case of linear energy harvester which comprises of multiple translating plates moving below the free surface the operation speed can be lower than this range attiya et al 2017 hence in order to mimic the natural setting of this type of applications the uniform streamwise component of the velocity at the inlet is set 0 5 m s for the water and 0 01 m s for the air reynolds number re ρu water d μ based on the inlet water velocity u w a t e r and the plate height d is 50 000 here ρ is the density and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the water the characteristic length used to calculate reynolds number was taken to be the plate height d normal to the flow direction in multiple previous studies for flows past objects the object fixed width was taken as a characteristic length when it comes to the reynolds number calculations instead of the hydraulic diameter saha et al 2003 sohankar 2008 taira and colonius 2009 it is important to emphasize the significance of the blockage ratio on these flows in the flow studied here the largest blockage ratio is about 5 previous studies have shown that for blockage ratios less than 5 there is no significant effect on the pressure distribution and the drag coefficient west and apelt 1982 sohankar et al 1998 kolekar and banerjee 2015 aghsaee and markfort 2018 the zero pressure gradient is imposed at the outlet and the no slip boundary condition is imposed at the plate surface the top and bottom surface of the computational domain the periodic boundary condition is imposed at the side surfaces of the computational domain the geometric and physical parameters used in this study are listed in table 1 the simulations are conducted by utilizing the open source computational fluid dynamics cfd software package open field operation and manipulation openfoam the interfoam vof solver designed for two phase incompressible isothermal and immiscible fluids is employed to capture the interface between the water and the air accurately the main advantage of the interfoam solver is the usage of the multi dimensional universal limiter for explicit solution mules method which is a very effective method to ensure the boundedness of each phase fraction in a way that is independent of underlying numerical scheme and mesh structure openfoam 2018 the transient solver pimplefoam is used for the pressure velocity coupling by utilizing pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm the adjustable time step based on a specified courant number is adopted to enhance the numerical stability of the simulation the second order time discretization crank nicolson is implemented for the temporal discretization moreover the discretization methods used for laplacian gradient interpolation and divergence are gauss linear limited gauss linear linear and gauss linear respectively the vof equation is discretized using the second order gauss vanleer scheme detailed descriptions of the discretization methods can be found in greenshields 2015 in order to control the iterative process used by the transient solver pimplefoam two criteria are implemented to evaluate the temporal convergence the first one is achieved by monitoring the residuals for the iterative process implemented within the solver to solve the continuity momentum and volume fraction equations the second criterion is imposed by monitoring the time evolution of the drag and the lift coefficient the simulations are considered converged when the residuals reached the preset threshold value and when the drag and lift show a quasi periodic state the threshold is set 10 8 for the volume fraction 10 8 for the velocity and 10 6 for the pressure the computational domain consists of subdomains discretized by the nested structured mesh and connected by non conformal interfaces as shown in fig 2 the meshing approach provides more flexibility in controlling the refinement around the plate and the free surface the mesh is refined in the regions near the plate and the free surface as shown in fig 2 b the cell size is increased gradually away from the plate and the free surface 4 validation and spatial convergence study 4 1 validation the mathematical model and the numerical method employed are validated using experimental data reported by malavasi and guadagnini 2007 flows past a rectangular cylinder placed beneath a free surface are considered for the validation study the detailed description of the geometry and the computational domain are depicted in fig 3 the cylinder is fully submerged in the water with a depth of h where h h h b s predicted results by les vof models in the three dimensional geometry are compared to the measured results for re 3 68 104 h 2 and h b s 2 33 we tested four subgrid scale sgs models in the validation study against the experimental data 1 the one equation eddy viscosity keqn 2 the dynamic one

surface deformations predicted by each of the used sgs models matched well with those reported by malavasi and guadagnini 2007 see fig 6 of the reference however a noticeable discrepancy is observed in the drag and lift coefficient reported by the experiment and predicted by the les sgs models the drag and lift coefficients are defined b c d f d 1 2 ρ u 2 a y and c l f l 1 2 ρ u 2 a where f d is the drag force f l is the lift force and a is the projected area of the plate perpendicular to the oncoming flow the drag and lift coefficient is 2 78 and 7 65 measured 2 27 and 6 70 predicted by smagorinsky 2 28 and 6 62 by keqn 2 40 and 7 2 by dynamic keqn and 2 45 and 7 2 by wale the wale and the dynamickeqn both predict hydrodynamic loadings on the cylinder more accurately compared to other sgs models the wale model is selected here because the cpu time used for each time step is 7 s compared to 10 s in the case of dynamickeqn a larger number of iterations required for the convergence at each time step for the dynamickeqn model sohankar 2014 the contours of the vorticity in the water domain and the contours of the water volume fraction are illustrated in fig 4 we compared the predicted results by wale sgs model against the experimental observation regarding the behavior of air entrainment into the water the free surface deformations and the location where the surface drops down at the trailing edge of the rectangular cylinder see fig 6 in malavasi and guadagnini 2007 the free surface dynamics predicted agree very well with measurements fig 5 depicts the time signature of the drag and lift coefficient the negative value of the lift coefficient is a result of the negative suction pressure produced by the flow separation that mostly occurred on the lower portion of the square cylinder the vortex shedding from the top portion of the cylinder is suppressed by the proximity of the free surface strouhal number calculated is 0 2 which agrees reasonably well with that reported in malavasi and guadagnini 2007 the results of the validation study demonstrate that the les vof model and the numerical method utilized can accurately simulate the complex turbulent flows studied here 4 2 spatial convergence study we next present the results of the mesh independence study multiphase simulations are conducted using the vof les turbulence model for flows past the plate with the length to height ratio l d of 5 the mesh density of n 1 3 106 cells n 2 7 106 cells and n 3 14 106 cells are used to calculate the drag and lift coefficient each mesh includes two nested mesh blocks an outer block mainly in the air region and far away from the plate toward the bottom of the domain and an inner block around the plate and in the wake region this approach allows a higher refinement in region of interest while using a coarser mesh in the others see fig 2 the number of grids used in the two nested mesh blocks for the three different meshes are 363 156 and 226 for n 1 408 186 and 326 for n 2 and finally 526 236 and 424 for n 3 in the x y and z directions respectively the structured mesh minimum cell size implemented in the current study close to the plate surface for each of the three meshes n 1 n 2 and n 3 is 0 8 mm 0 5 mm and 0 3 mm respectively all the three meshes have a maximum cell size of 3 mm located in the regions close to the outlet of the domain within the outer mesh block the distribution of the mesh is implemented in a way that concentrate the refinement around the plate and close to the free surface bias factor of 4 is applied in the structured mesh to control the mesh expansion away from the surface of the plate in both the x and y direction while a constant division spacing is applied in the z direction without any bias factor the time signature of the drag coefficient obtained by n 1 n 2 and n 3 is shown in fig 6 as a function of the non dimensional time λ tu water d the mean y value along the plate surface the mean and maximum value of the courant number and the mean and root mean square value of the predicted drag and lift coefficient for n 1 and n 2 and n 3 are tabulated in table 2 the difference in the time averaged drag and lift coefficient is 3 98 and 3 5 between n 1 and n 2 and 2 2 and 1 1 between n 2 and n 3 the root mean square and standard deviation of drag and lift coefficient obtained by n2 and n3 are also similar the mean y value decreases from 5 16 for n 1 to 1 45 for n 3 along the wall of the plate which corresponds to a decrease in the first layer thickness as the mesh density is increased considering the limitation of the computational resources the results presented in this paper are obtained using the mesh density of n 2 the profiles of the time averaged streamwise component of the velocity acquired at downstream locations of the plate 1d 3d and 5d away from the center of the plate see fig 7 a using the mesh density of n 1 n 2 and n 3 are depicted in fig 7 the velocity profiles obtained using n 2 7 106 and n 3 14 106 cells are similar while the profiles obtained using n 1 differs slightly it is demonstrated here that the mesh density n 2 ensures spatial convergence 5 results and discussion simulations are conducted for three dimensional multiphase flows past a finite plate beneath a free surface with a depth of 0 15d corresponding to fr number of 1 30 and re 50 000 a plate length of 2 5d 5d and 10d are considered for simulations utilizing the vof les with the wale sgs turbulence model the profiles of the time averaged streamwise component of the velocity along the crossflow direction acquired at various upstream and downstream locations are shown in fig 8 upstream of the plate there is a negative spike in the velocity above the upper edge of the plate indicative of a recirculating vortex the value of the spike is greater for the geometry with smaller l d while it is very small for wider l d values the negative spike occurs inside the thin shear layer attached to the top surface at the location corresponding to the bottom edge of the plate there is a positive spike in the velocity that increases with l d which highlights the jet like flow structure around the corner of the plate further along the upstream direction the profiles are similar in all geometries reverse flow is observed in all cases at the upper part of the plate while the jet like flow is observed at the lower part of the plate further away from the plate both toward the free surface or the bottom wall uniform velocity profiles are recovered downstream of the plate the velocity profiles still show the negative spike characteristic of a recirculating vortex however the location of the vortex is now in the center of the plate the profiles also show the generation of large scale eddies that increase in magnitude with l d between the free surface and the top of the plate jet like flow is observed in all geometries with greater intensity for l d of 10 further away from the plate the free shear layer velocity profiles are recovered the recovery of the shear layer occurs in a shorter distance from the plate for l d of 2 5 the velocity profiles near the free surface are different than that at a deeper location away from the interface at both upstream and downstream locations fig 9 depicts the instantaneous vorticity for l d of 2 5 5 and 10 at z 0 and y 0 planes upstream of the plate there is a shear layer attached to the free surface this layer has an important role in vortex shedding interactions with submerged bodies patel et al 1984 as l d increases from 2 5 the shear layer separates from the free surface and hairpin like vortices erupted from the free surface and impinge on the plate the magnitude of the upstream vorticity near the plate increases with l d as seen in fig 9 b tip vortices shed from side surfaces of the plate generate eddies as l d increases the back surface of the plate is exposed to air due to the deflection of the free surface near the vicinity of the plate immediately downstream of the top surface of the plate as shown through the contours in fig 9 there is a high vortical activity this is reduced as l d increases because as previously mentioned the plate surface becomes exposed to air and thus cannot aid in vortex shedding and generation from the top surface this causes vortex shedding to occur mainly from the bottom surface of the plate tip vortices generated from the sides of the plate interact with the karman vortex shedding generated from the top and bottom surface of the plate in all flows a similar decrease in vortex activity is observed in the immediate region downstream from the center of the plate although it is caused by a different phenomenon as l d increases the tip vortices could not penetrate to the center of the plate which reduces vortical activity in the center region as shown in fig 9 the plate length has a strong influence on the levels of interaction between the tip vortices and those shed from the top and bottom surface of the plate the flow images also show the vortex shedding and dissipation downstream of the plate lagrangian coherent structures lcs and eulerian q criterion are calculated to track the evolution of the vorticity in complex turbulence flows lcss images are obtained from the ridges of finite time lyapunov exponent ftle fields shadden et al 2005 while the q criterion represents the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor used to characterize vortex concentration the q criterion is defined as q 0 5 s 2 ω 2 where s is the strain tensor and ω represents the rotation tensor additional information is provided by hunt et al 1988 the details of the procedure identifying lcs are described in a section of the supplement both lcs and eulerian q criterion show the complex flow behaviors associated with the free surface structure interaction the eulerian and lagrangian vortex identification methods reveal similar flow structures but lcs identifies the evolution and the interaction of vortices better the reason for this difference is related to the arbitrary threshold used in the q criterion users specify arbitrary threshold values to detect the vortex cores and that would change the spatial distribution of vortices fig 10 depicts the eulerian and lagrangian flow images with a plate l d of 2 5 and 5 contours of the q criterion and lcs are rendered at the z 0 plane the coherent structures mainly concentrate close to the free surface and at the near wake of the plate brighter images of the ftle fields indicate higher intensities for lcs implying higher turbulent activities the free surface presence inhibits the formation of large scale shedding yet it allows for the formation of small kelvin helmholtz like vortical instabilities generated from the free surface see fig 10 b d there is a high concentration of small scale vortices near the free surface within a thin layer upstream of the plate the shear layer attached to the free surface interacts with the upper tip of the plate and in the case of the plate with higher aspect ratio the vortices generated from the shear layer roll into the bottom of the plate the hairpin like vortices formed from the free surface above the plate and vorticity generated from the top side of the plate interact with each other for the plate length of 2 5d the region near the front face of the plate lacks vortical activities fig 11 depicts the contours of the q criterion and lcs for l d of 5 at various height intervals from the top to the bottom surface of the plate 5 y d 5 the ftle field is the brightest for images rendered near the surface y 0 5 d plane and the intensity of the ftle field is reduced gradually for images acquired further away from the free surface images at the left and the right column denote the q criterion and lcs respectively the eulerian and lagrangian images rendered at the top surface of the plate demonstrate that the flow fields near the plate are strongly influenced by the presence of the free surface there are layers of rolling vortices observed in the region upstream of the plate these vortices wrap around the plate and interact with the tip vortices causing high intensity small eddies generation in the near wake region of the plate the vortex rolls generated from the free surface dissipate in the cross flow direction the region upstream of the plate at the depth y 0 5d has little or no vortical activities as depicted in fig 11 the flow images shown in fig s1 for l d 2 5 reveal similar characteristics with an exception that there are weaker vortical activities in the region near the front face of the plate at any depth at the plane y d 0 5 further away from the surface vortex shedding patterns are more regular in both geometries the flow structures presented here will influence the pressure coefficient at the front and back face of the plate and command the drag and lift signatures of the plate as presented below it is demonstrated here that the eulerian and the lagrangian vortex identification tools can be utilized together to characterize the flow field effectively although the q criterion contours might lack some details due to their instantaneous nature the flow patterns revealed by the eulerian and lagrangian method match well the eulerian and lagrangian flow images are complementary to each other in describing the turbulent flow fields three dimensional flow images of iso surfaces of the q criterion for l d of 2 5 5 and 10 shown in fig s2 underscore the features of the turbulent flow patterns revealed by the eulerian and lagrangian coherent structure contours figs 9 figs 10 and 11 the hairpin like vortices burst from the free surface upstream of the plate and impinge on the plate for l d of 5 and 10 these vortices are not present in the geometry with l d of 2 5 it is also noticed that the near wake flow field is dominated by vortices generated by the plate while the far wake flow field is dominated by rolling vortices generated from the free surface the interaction of the free surface and the plate creates turbulent flows with spatial and temporal characteristics that are strongly dependent on the plate length the thin shear layer attached to the free surface is one source of the vorticity generation mechanism as reported by cetiner and rockwell 2001 the surface deformation and the induced small scale vortex structures are highly influenced by the plate geometry and the froude number in the present study the froude number is fixed while the plate geometry is varied the presence of the plate will alter and disturb the velocity profiles upstream of the plate see fig 8 two distinct vortex sheddings occur a shedding from the thin vorticity layer attached to the free surface and a shedding from the plate itself the evolution and interaction of these vortices generate complex velocity fields which are influenced by the plate length instantaneous contours of the water volume fraction for l d of 2 5 5 and 10 are depicted in fig 12 the water volume fraction of unity represents the cell filled with the water and of zero represents the cell filled with the air generally air entrainment happens as a result of surface deformations that are caused by the hydraulic jump fig 12 shows that entrainment is maximized at l d of 2 5 and decreases as the aspect ratio increases there is also free surface deflection at each l d where the hydraulic jump is largest at an l d of 10 the intensity of hydraulic jump increases as l d increases and the jump occurs closer to the plate with an increasing l d as a result of hydraulic jump the back of the normally submerged plate is exposed to air for l d of 5 and 10 further downstream where the flow is less affected by the plate the free surface eventually rebounds to an undisturbed level the level of surface deflection and the distance where the surface rebounds to the undisturbed level increase as l d increases fig 13 shows the distribution of reynolds normal stress u u profiles in the crossflow direction at various upstream and downstream locations the reynold stress is a measure of the turbulent intensity of the flow in the upstream region the reynolds stress assumes a maximum value near the plate s top surface and then decreases to zero near the bottom of the plate the rapid decay of the peak highlights the kelvin helmholtz vortices close to the plate and as l d increases the magnitude of the peak stress increases after 1d in the streamwise direction the reynolds stresses do not change with x d and reach a constant value because far away from the plate the thin free shear layer maintains vortical activities and turbulent intensity downstream of the plate in the wake region there are two peaks present in the reynolds profiles both of which have a greater magnitude than the upstream stresses the first peak corresponds to the strong interaction of the vortices generated from the top and free surface this peak rapidly falls off along the streamwise direction implying stationary vortical activity as well as significant free surface damping in the streamwise direction the second peak is found at the bottom surface of the plate where karman vortices are shed as the streamwise direction is increased there is a shift in the intensity between the two peaks where the second peak becomes larger than the first due to the damping of turbulent activity downstream top of the plate the second bottom surface peak increases in the streamwise direction highlighting that the vortices shed from the bottom surface remain strong in between the two peaks there is a zone in the middle of the plate with lower turbulent intensity showing little vortical activity in that region as l d is increased the value of all peaks increase and the peaks decay slower it is also noted that the elevated reynolds stress at downstream of the plate is observed on a wider crossflow range than upstream due to strong turbulent activities in the wake region as the streamwise distance increases the reynolds stress profile becomes more uniform implying that mixing is taking place and the turbulent flow is becoming more homogenous the time signatures of the drag and lift coefficient c d c l for l d of 2 5 5 and 10 are depicted in fig 14 the mean drag coefficient averaged for 300 000 time steps or 15 s for the plate length of 2 5d 5d and 10d is calculated to be 1 88 1 79 and 1 73 respectively the standard deviations of the drag coefficient signals are determined to be 0 058 0 11 and 0 12 respectively indicating that the amplitude of pressure fluctuation increases as plate length is increased this is because the larger portion of the back face of the plate is exposed to the air for longer plates creating more irregular flow dynamics note that the plate length of 2 5d has the highest c d because of the lack of vortical activities in front of the plate the higher pressure difference between the front and back surfaces of the plate results in a higher c d plate length of 10d has the lowest c d because the population of the small and large eddies in the region near upstream of the plate is the greatest for the longer plate the pressure contours along the front and back face of the plate with l d of 2 5 5 and 10 validate the predictions of the drag coefficient the pressure acting on the front face of the plate is the highest for l d of 2 5 as seen in fig s3 with an increase of vortical activities in the front of the plate as the length is increased the pressure acting on the front face decreases resulting in the lower drag coefficient the time averaged value of the lift coefficient is positive in all geometries and it is greater for l d of 2 5 than that for l d of 5 and 10 the positive value of the lift coefficient refers to as the plate is pulled toward the free surface the non zero values of the lift coefficient are results of the induced asymmetry in the flow by the presence of the free surface the lift forces are sensitive to the free surface plate interaction and the flow asymmetry as reported by malavasi and guadagnini 2007 the time averaged pressure coefficient c p acquired at the central vertical plane z 0 of the plate at the front back top and bottom surface is examined the mean pressure coefficient is defined as 6 c p p m e a n p s ρ g h where p s is the hydrostatic pressure evaluated by the simulated water level the pressure coefficient profiles of the shorter plates are similar while the longer plate has a different pressure distribution as shown in fig s4 a similar trend can be seen in the pressure contours rendered in fig s3 more importantly the pressure difference between the front and the back surface which mainly determines the drag coefficient of the plate is lower for the longer plate compared to the shorter plates this explains that the longer plate has a lower drag coefficient value it is also worth mentioning that the air entrainment and the plate exposure to the air cause lower pressure on the rear surface of the longer plates see fig 8 and fig 9 fig s4 shows the distribution of the pressure coefficient on the top and bottom surface the flow field in the vicinity of the top and the bottom surface displays diverse characteristics due to the presence of the free surface the pressure acting on the bottom surface is the highest for the shortest plate and it decreases monotonically as the plate length is increased in each geometry the pressure acting on the top surface is similar and the pressure difference between the bottom and the top surface is positive at any x location indicating that the lift force exerted on the plate is in the direction toward the free surface 6 conclusions the volume of fluid vof and les turbulence model were utilized to simulate multiphase flows flows past a submerged plate in the proximity of a free surface were considered for l d of 2 5 5 and 10 at the fixed fr number of 1 30 and re number of 50 000 as the aspect ratio increases the free surface behavior will change and impact vortex dynamics and hydrodynamic loadings the mathematical models and numerical methods employed were validated using the experimental work of malavasi and guadagnini 2007 the eulerian and lagrangian methods were utilized to show three different sources of vorticity hairpin like vortices from the shear layer karman and tip vortices from plates edges all interact with each other in the wake while there were no significant vortical activities in the region upstream of the plate for l d of 2 5 for l d of 5 and 10 near the free surface hairpin like vortices erupt from the interface and impinge on the front face of the plate as l d increases the karman vortex shedding from the top surface of the plate is suppressed due to proximity to free surface at all l d there is a hydraulic jump in the system exposing the back of the plate to air the location of the jump is occurring closer to the plate as with l d is increasing and at 5 and 10 the jump occurs at the plate exposing the back surface to air as l d is increasing there is significant deformation in the free surface upstream of the plate enough to entrain air in that region the velocity profiles reflect the vortical activity generated near the vicinity of the plate upstream turbulent intensity increases with l d due to the erupting hairpin like vortices impinging on the plate but away from the plate there is no change in the distribution near downstream of the plate there are strong turbulent activities near the plate and the free surface which could be dampened further downstream at the bottom of the plate karman and hairpin vortices shed from the shear layer interact and expand further downwards as well as intensify before dissipating in further downstream the drag coefficient decreases slightly as the aspect ratio l d is increased the vortical activities near the front face of the plate were likely to be the reason for the drag reduction in the longer plates representing an important manifestation of the plate length on the pressure differential the lift without the hydrostatic effects was positive for all geometries considered implying that the plate is pulled toward the free surface the positive lift coefficient results from the high speed free shear layer observed near the top surface of the plate we observed that the lift coefficient was the greatest for the l d of 2 5 the current study provides a discussion on the interaction between the length of the plate and the vortical structures generated with different aspect ratios this offers a first step toward the understanding of the influence of such phenomenon on the performance of the offshore structures hydraulic devices when operating in the proximity of free surfaces this influence needs to be addressed and taken into account in the design processes of such devices acknowledgment this work used the extreme science and engineering discovery environment xsede supported by national science

also studied based on a simplified analysis method in h d 1 2 where h d means ratio of water depth h to ship draft d the check helm of the ship reaches 35 near η 0 l 0 27 where η 0 is the distance

stability of the ship at the equilibrium condition fujino 1968 1970 measured the hydrodynamic forces acting on a ship moving in a channel with changing parameters such as water depth distance from the ship to the centerline of the channel hull drift angle rudder angle etc in towing tank based on the measured results rudder deflection check helm and hull drift angle required for overcoming the bank suction force were calculated and the course stability of a ship moving in the centerline of the channel was theoretically investigated eda 1971 carried out a similar study and discussed a guideline to indicate acceptable ship size relative to waterway dimensions sano et al 2012 2014 derived a course stability criterion for a ship off centerline in a channel and investigated the course stability for an inland container ship based on the measured hydrodynamic force derivatives of the ship moving in a channel with variation of the parameters mentioned above there seems to be still few comprehensive studies about the navigation safety of the ship with inclusion of detailed hydrodynamic force data discussions about the equilibrium conditions and course stability analysis although there are many studies about the force prediction of ships in restricted water norrbin 1974 li et al 2003 vantorre et al 2003 lataire and vantorre 2008 yasukawa et al 2009 zou et al 2011 in this paper an analysis of the course stability is presented for a pure car carrier pcc in proximity of a bank the analysis is based on the method proposed by sano et al 2014 however a modification is made to the method to treat the problem conventionally for the analysis the hydrodynamic derivatives are required to capture those captive model tests are performed in deep and shallow water oblique towing test ott and circular motion test cmt are conducted to know the heel effect on the derivatives in shallow water ott and cmt are also conducted with variation of the heel angle of the ship model heel related derivatives in shallow water were not published so far although the heel related derivatives have been indicated in deep water by for instance yasukawa and yoshimura 2014 further ott is conducted for capturing bank effect on the derivatives the bank is sloped 45 using the derivatives obtained the course stability is analyzed for the pcc close to the bank the present analysis method is useful for conventionally capturing the course stability of the ship in the proximity of a bank 2 hull force model of a ship in close proximity to a bank 2 1 coordinate systems fig 1 shows the coordinate systems and notation used in this paper consider a ship moving close to a bank the ship moves in a straight line along the bank wall it is supposed that the bank s horizontal shape is uniform and the bank is starboard of the ship the bank wall is inclined 45 as shown in left figure of fig 1 the water depth h is assumed to be constant consider the space fixed coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 where the x 0 y 0 plane coincides with the still water surface and the z 0 axis is taken vertically downwards the x 0 axis is taken in parallel to the bank wall with a lateral distance w from the bank toe at the sea bottom as shown in fig 1 s is the distance from the bank toe to the ship side the y 0 axis is taken laterally as being the right handed system the ship is assumed to sail only in the region of y 0 0 if sailing in the region of y 0 0 the bank effect vanishes in addition consider the horizontal body fixed coordinate system hamamoto and kim 1993 o x y z the x axis is taken toward ship s bow direction the y axis is taken laterally positive to starboard and the z axis vertically downwards the x y plane also coincides with the still water surface therefore the origin o is located at the midship position on the still water surface the heading angle ψ is defined as the direction between x 0 axis and x axis and the roll angle is denoted by ϕ clockwise rotation is

heel effect on the hydrodynamic force characteristic in deep and shallow water oblique towing test ott and circular motion test cmt with variation of the heel angle were carried out in the hiroshima university towing tank length 100 m width 8 m water depth 3 5 m ott and cmt are the tests to measure the hydrodynamic forces acting on the ship model in oblique moving and or steady turning the water depths were changed by a vertically moving bottom equipped to the tank as 38 5 1 5 and 1 2 in h d the case of h d 38 5 is called deep the moving bottom consists of separated bottoms divided into seven in the longitudinal direction the overall length of the moving bottom is about 21 m and the width is 5 m at the left and right of the moving bottom the wave absorbers installed in the tank sides are placed although there is a gap between the moving bottom and the tank wall it has been confirmed that the gap effect can be ignored by using the central part of the moving bottom this comes from that the ship model is smaller than the size of the moving bottom and the ship speed is slow in shallow water tests 4 1 1 outline the tests were carried out using a pcc model shown in fig 3 in the condition with rudder and without propeller in the tests surge force x h lateral force y h yaw moment around midship n h and roll moment k h were measured using a four component dynamometer the measurements were carried out in heave and trim fixed condition in order to eliminate the effect of squat the roll moment was measured only in case of ϕ 0 ship speed u in the deep water was 0 651 m s equivalent to 12 0 kn for full scale ship froude number f n 0 147 and the speed in h d 1 5 and 1 2 was 0 325 m s equivalent to 6 0 kn for full scale ship f n 0 074 the measurements were made for the hull drift angle β from 20 to 20 every 5 non dimensional yaw rate r from 0 3 to 0 3 with the step 0 1 and heel angle ϕ of 0 5 and 10 the four component dynamometer was arranged above the still water surface since internal space of the ship model was limited then the moment component due to centrifugal force inertia force component is induced in the measured roll moment which was deducted from the measured roll moment using other measured force components by converting the resulting roll moment the roll moment around x axis located on the still water surface was obtained static restoring roll moment was deducted from the results 4 1 2 test results figs 4 6 show the surge force the lateral force and yaw moment coefficients x h y h and n h of ϕ 0 and 10 in three different water depths in the figures dotted lines represent the fitting results using eqs 4 to 6 table 2 shows the hydrodynamic derivatives obtained absolute values of y v n v and n r increase with decrease of water depth this is a typical shallow water effect in the hydrodynamic derivatives in addition absolute values of y ϕ and n ϕ also increase with decrease of water depth next the vertical acting point of the hull lateral force is considered fig 7 shows the roll moment coefficient k h versus the lateral force coefficient y h with ϕ 0 in three different water depths inclination of k h to y h means the vertical acting point of the lateral force z h z h l in the figure the results are classified to three categories such as ott results pure sway in the graph cmt results without β pure yaw and cmt results with β sway yaw mean lines of k h versus y h are drawn for each in the figure table 3 shows the non dimensional vertical acting point z h for each each value is quite different in deep water z h is positive for pure sway on the other hand z h is negative for pure yaw and this means the vertical acting point is located above the free surface in sway yaw z h is positive but the value is about 60 of the value in pure sway thus the vertical acting point of the hull lateral force takes different values according to the maneuvering mode such as oblique moving and turning similar results in deep water were indicated by fukui et al 2016 in shallow water z h changes to negative direction as a whole it is considered that this comes from the effect of not only the lateral force component acting on the hull but also the vertical force component which was neglected in this analysis however the detailed mechanism is not clear at present 4 2 tests for capturing bank effect on hydrodynamic forces to capture the bank effect on the hydrodynamic force characteristics in shallow water ott tests with variation of distance between ship centerline and bank wall were carried out the bank model was arranged on the moving bottom of the tank fig 8 shows a ship model moving in the proximity of the bank model 4 2 1 outline the tests were carried out using the same pcc model in the tests surge force lateral force yaw moment around midship and roll moment were measured for a fixed model in the motions using a four component dynamometer the roll moment was measured only in case of β 0 ship speed u in h d 1 5 and 1 2 was 0 325 m s equivalent to 6 0 kn for full scale ship f n 0 074 in the tests the distance from the bank toe to the ship side s was changed as shown in table 4 s 0 means that the ship side position coincides with the bank toe position at the sea bottom based on the measured data of the lateral force and yaw moment w was set to be 0 45 l 899 mm in the model as the position where the force and moment become zero η is calculated using the formula η w s b 2 table 4 also shows the values of η in the tank tests η l was changed as 0 09 0 18 and 0 27 and for each β was changed as 10 10 with interval 5 the tests were also added in the conditions of η l 0 31 and 0 36 for only β 0 4 2 2 test results fig 9 shows test results of surge force coefficient x h lateral force coefficient y h and yaw moment coefficient n h with three different η l in h d 1 5 and 1 2 the horizontal axis is non dimensionalized lateral velocity v which is defined as sin β in the figure dotted lines represent the fitting results using eqs 4 to 6 a vertical shift is observed in x h and n h with changing η l although y h does not change very much then the hydrodynamic derivatives related to η are shown in table 5 fig 10 shows hydrodynamic force coefficients acting on the ship hull with β 0 when moving parallel to the bank x h is negative i e the resistance acting on the hull with increase of η l the absolute value of x h increases slightly y h i e the bank suction force increases with increase of η l n h is negative i e the bow out moment from the bank acts on the ship hull the shallow water effect on n h is more significant next the vertical acting point of the hull lateral force bank suction force is considered fig 11 shows the roll moment coefficient k h versus the lateral force coefficient y h with β 0 in different water depths inclination of k h to y h means the vertical acting point of the suction force z h k h is roughly proportional to y h mean lines of k h versus y h are drawn in the figure z h is 0 046 in h d 1 5 and 0 027 in h d 1 2 z h is positive in both and this means that the vertical acting point of the suction force is located below the free surface although it was negative in h d 1 2 without the presence of the bank as shown in table 3 when the ship moves in close proximity to the bank the acting point shifts downwards due to the bank effect 5 course stability analysis of the ship close to a bank the course stability of the ship sailing close to a bank is discussed using the hydrodynamic derivatives obtained 5 1 motion equations it is assumed that ship speed u is given and the surge coupling effect is negligible the roll coupling effect is also neglected since the ship speed is slow and the heel roll angle is small then the motion equations with respect to sway and yaw are expressed as 8 m m y v m m m x r m x g r y h y δ δ 9 i z j z m x g 2 r m x g v m r n h n δ δ in the equations eq 8 is non dimensionalized by division of 1 2

acting point of the bank suction force n η y η v 0 is proportional to the difference between the longitudinal acting point of the rudder force n δ y δ and the longitudinal acting point of the bank suction force n η y η next from eqs 8 and 9 the unsteady terms are obtained as follows 17 m m y δ η m x g δ ψ y v δ η y η δ η y r m x m y δ ψ y v δ ψ y δ δ δ 18 m x g δ η i z j z m x g 2 δ ψ n v δ η n η δ η n r m x g δ ψ n v δ ψ n δ δ δ eqs 17 and 18 are coupled linear differential equations with unknown variables δ ψ and δ η which are the base equations for discussing course stability for modeling the autopilot the rudder angle δ δ is assumed to be expressed as a pd controller as follows 19 δ δ g 1 δ ψ g 2 δ ψ where g 1 and g 2 are control gains then the characteristic equation of eqs 17 and 18 where λ denotes the solution is expressed as follows 20 d 4 λ 4 d 3 λ 3 d 2 λ 2 d 1 λ d 0 0 where 21 d 4 m m y i z j z m x g 2 x g 2 m 2 22 d 3 m m y n r m x g n δ g 2 i z j z m x g 2 y v x g m n v y

d 0 y v y δ g 1 n η y η n v n δ g 1 motion stability can be examined by routh hurwitz stability criterion according to which necessary conditions for the course stability are written as 26 d 0 d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 0 27 d 5 d 3 d 2 d 1 d 3 2 d 0 d 4 d 1 2 0 if these conditions are satisfied the course instability theoretically never occurs d 4 d 3 and d 0 become hydrodynamically positive for common ships so that we have to check the sign of d 1 d 2 and d 5 5 2 analysis result the course stability analysis of the pcc sailing close to a bank is carried out using the formulas mentioned above as the hydrodynamic derivatives the measured data obtained in the captive model test mentioned in previous section are used table 6 shows the rudder force and virtual mass coefficients used in the analysis virtual mass coefficient such as m m x m m y and i z j z were determined according to yoshimura 1986 and were assumed to be constant in variation of η 0 l y δ and n δ in the table were determined with reference to the tank test data by sano et al 2014 fig 12 shows the calculation results of y v n v n v y v y η n η and n η y η versus η 0 l which are calculated using eq 14 n v y v means the longitudinal acting point of lateral force in oblique towing condition and n η y η means the longitudinal acting point of the bank suction force in both h d 1 5 and 1 2 absolute values of y v y η and n η increase with increase of η 0 l as a result n η y η also increases change of n η y η to positive direction means that the longitudinal acting point shifts forwards compared with those change of n v y v with increase of η 0 l is small and this value is always positive fig 13 shows calculation results of check helm δ 0 and heading angle ψ 0 v 0 versus η 0 l with increase of η 0 l δ 0 increases and this tendency is more significant in h d 1 2 δ 0 reaches 35 near η 0 l 0 27 in h d 1 2 if the ship sails any closer to the bank wall there is a collision risk with the bank due to insufficient rudder force on the other hand ψ 0 is quite small however it is important to note that the ship stern may come into contact with the bank if the steering is mistaken because the bank suction force and the bow out yaw moment act on the ship hull the reason why δ 0 increases significantly with increase of η 0 l is that n η y η changes significantly with η 0 l and n v y v is positive and almost constant see eq 15 additionally the reason why ψ 0 is smaller than δ 0 by one order of magnitude is that the absolute value of y δ is smaller than that of y v by one order of magnitude mainly where the water depth changes from h d 1 5 to h d 1 2 check helm δ 0 becomes significantly large the helmsman must pay attention to the change for safe navigation fig 14 shows calculation results of d 1 d 2 and 100 d 5 in both h d 1 5 and h d 1 2 for g 1 g 2 0 in h d 1 5 d 2 is always positive d 1 is partially negative and d 5 is fully negative in h d 1 2 d 1 and d 2 are always positive and only d 5 becomes negative when discussing the course stability of ships in proximity of a bank d 5 is the most important this is the same as the analysis result by sano et al 2014 for an inland container ship in case of no rudder control g 1 g 2 0 this ship is course unstable to improve the course instability rudder control gains for autopilot change as follows 1 g 1 g 2 0 no control 2 g 1 g 2 4 control with mild sensitivity 3 g 1 g 2 6 control with high sensitivity according to eda 1971 the control of g 1 g 2 4 is called as control with mild sensitivity and that of g 1 g 2 6 as control with high sensitivity fig 15 shows calculation result of 100 d 5 in both h d 1 5 and h d 1 2 for g 1 g 2 0 100 d 5 is fully negative and this ship is course unstable changing the gains to g 1 g 2 4 and g 1 g 2 6 the line of 100 d 5 shifts vertically upward and the value of 100 d 5 becomes positive for g 1 g 2 4 in h d 1 2 100 d 5 becomes fully positive and the ship is course stable although d 1 was partially negative without rudder control in h d 1 5 as shown in fig 14 d 1 becomes positive by employing the autopilot with small gains 6 concluding remarks in this paper an analysis of the course stability was presented for a pure car carrier pcc in proximity to a bank the analysis is based on the method proposed by sano et al 2014 however a modification is made to the method to treat the problem conventionally for the analysis the hydrodynamic derivatives are required to capture those captive model tests were performed in deep and shallow water oblique towing test ott and circular motion test cmt were conducted with variation of the heel angle of the ship model to know the heel effect of the derivatives further ott was conducted for capturing bank effect on the derivatives using the derivatives obtained the course stability was analyzed for the pcc in bank proximity in h d 1 2 the check helm reaches 35 near η 0 l 0 27 where η 0 is the distance between the ship center line and the bank the helmsman must pay attention to the steering for safe navigation in this situation additionally this ship is course unstable in case of no rudder control in any water depths however the ship becomes course stable by employing the autopilot with gains g 1 g 2 4 which is called as control with mild sensitivity eda 1971 the present analysis method is useful for conventionally assessing course stability of a ship in the proximity of a bank finally it is added that the hydrodynamic derivatives data provided in this study are useful for the maneuvering

also studied based on a simplified analysis method in h d 1 2 where h d means ratio of water depth h to ship draft d the check helm of the ship reaches 35 near η 0 l 0 27 where η 0 is the distance between the ship center line and the bank although this ship is course unstable in case of no rudder control the ship becomes course stable in any water depths by employing the autopilot with

stability of the ship at the equilibrium condition fujino 1968 1970 measured the hydrodynamic forces acting on a ship moving in a channel with changing parameters such as water depth distance from the ship to the centerline of the channel hull drift angle rudder angle etc in towing tank based on the measured results rudder deflection check helm and hull drift angle required for overcoming the bank suction force were calculated and the course stability of a ship moving in the centerline of the channel was theoretically investigated eda 1971 carried out a similar study and discussed a guideline to indicate acceptable ship size relative to waterway dimensions sano et al 2012 2014 derived a course stability criterion for a ship off centerline in a channel and investigated the course stability for an inland container ship based on the measured hydrodynamic force derivatives of the ship moving in a channel with variation of the parameters mentioned above there seems to be still few comprehensive studies about the navigation safety of the ship with inclusion of detailed hydrodynamic force data discussions about the equilibrium conditions and course stability analysis although there are many studies about the force prediction of ships in restricted water norrbin 1974 li et al 2003 vantorre et al 2003 lataire and vantorre 2008 yasukawa et al 2009 zou et al 2011 in this paper an analysis of the course stability is presented for a pure car carrier pcc in proximity of a bank the analysis is based on the method proposed by sano et al 2014 however a modification is made to the method to treat the problem conventionally for the analysis the hydrodynamic derivatives are required to capture those captive model tests are performed in deep and shallow water oblique towing test ott and circular motion test cmt are conducted to know the heel effect on the derivatives in shallow water ott and cmt are also conducted with variation of the heel angle of the ship model heel

conducted for capturing bank effect on the derivatives the bank is sloped 45 using the derivatives obtained the course stability is analyzed for the pcc close to the bank the present analysis method is useful for conventionally capturing the course stability of the ship in the proximity of a bank 2 hull force model of a ship in close proximity to a bank 2 1 coordinate systems fig 1 shows the coordinate systems and notation used in this paper consider a ship moving close to a bank the ship moves in a straight line along the bank wall it is supposed that the bank s horizontal shape is uniform and the bank is starboard of the ship the bank wall is inclined 45 as shown in left figure of fig 1 the water depth h is assumed to be constant consider the space fixed coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 where the x 0 y 0 plane coincides with the still water surface and the z 0 axis is taken vertically downwards the x 0 axis is taken in parallel to the bank wall with a lateral distance w from the bank toe at the sea bottom as shown in fig 1 s is the distance from the bank toe to the ship side the y 0 axis is taken laterally as being the right handed system the ship is assumed to sail only in the region of y 0 0 if sailing in the region of y 0 0 the bank effect vanishes in addition consider the horizontal body fixed coordinate system hamamoto and kim 1993 o x y z the x axis is taken toward ship s bow direction the y axis is taken laterally positive to starboard and the z axis vertically downwards the x y plane also coincides with the still water surface therefore the origin o is located at the midship position on the still water surface the heading angle ψ is defined as the direction between x 0 axis and x axis and the roll angle is denoted by ϕ clockwise rotation is positive for roll when looking from ship s stern to the fore direction u and v denote the velocity components of x axis and y axis directions respectively and r the yaw rate around z axis δ denotes the rudder angle the center of gravity g is approximately located at the position x g 0 z g then the lateral velocity component at o position v m is expressed as 1 v m v x g r z g ϕ total velocity u is defined as u u 2 v m 2 and the hull drift angle at o position β is evaluated by β tan 1 v m u note that ψ coincides with β when the ship moves to the direction of x 0 axis as shown in fig 1 lateral deviation of the ship centerline at midship position from x 0 axis is denoted by η between η and the velocity components u and v m the following relation is hold as 2 η u sin ψ v m cos ψ here the dot

fig 2 shows the body plan of the ship and fig 3 shows the side view of the pcc model used in the tank tests 4 captive model tests 4 1 tests with variation of heel angle in shallow water to capture the heel effect on the hydrodynamic force characteristic in deep and shallow water oblique towing test ott and circular motion test cmt with variation of the heel angle were carried out in the hiroshima university towing tank length 100 m width 8 m water depth 3 5 m ott and cmt are the tests to measure the hydrodynamic forces acting on the ship model in oblique moving and or steady turning the water depths were changed by a vertically moving bottom equipped to the tank as 38 5 1 5 and 1 2 in h d the case of h d 38 5 is called deep the moving bottom consists of separated bottoms divided into seven in the longitudinal direction the overall length of the moving bottom is about 21 m and the width is 5 m at the left and right of the moving bottom the wave absorbers installed in the tank sides are placed although there is a gap between the moving bottom and the tank wall it has been confirmed that the gap effect can be ignored by using the central part of the moving bottom this comes from that the ship model is smaller than the size of the moving bottom and the ship speed is slow in shallow water tests 4 1 1 outline the tests were carried out using a pcc model shown in fig 3 in the condition with rudder and without propeller in the tests surge force x h lateral force y h yaw moment around midship n h and roll moment k h were measured using a four component dynamometer the measurements were carried out in heave and trim fixed condition in order to eliminate the effect of squat the roll moment was measured only in case of ϕ 0 ship speed u in the deep water was 0 651 m s equivalent to 12 0 kn for full scale ship froude number f n 0 147 and the speed in h d 1 5 and 1 2 was 0 325 m s equivalent to 6 0 kn for full scale ship f n 0 074 the measurements were made for the hull drift angle β from 20 to 20 every 5 non dimensional yaw rate r from 0 3 to 0 3 with the step 0 1 and heel angle ϕ of 0 5 and 10 the four component dynamometer was arranged above the still water surface since internal space of the ship model was limited then the moment component due to centrifugal force inertia force component is induced in the measured roll moment which was deducted from the measured roll moment using other measured force components by converting the resulting roll moment the roll moment around x axis located on the still water surface was obtained static restoring roll moment was deducted from the results 4 1 2 test results figs 4 6 show the surge force the lateral force and yaw moment coefficients x h y h and n h of ϕ 0 and 10 in three different water depths in the figures dotted lines represent the fitting results using eqs 4 to 6 table 2 shows the hydrodynamic derivatives obtained absolute values of y v n v and n r increase with decrease of water depth this is a typical shallow water effect in the hydrodynamic derivatives in addition absolute values of y ϕ and n ϕ also increase with decrease of water depth next the vertical acting point of the hull lateral

yaw mean lines of k h versus y h are drawn for each in the figure table 3 shows the non dimensional vertical acting point z h for each each value is quite different in deep water z h is positive for pure sway on the other hand z h is negative for pure yaw and this means the vertical acting point is located above the free surface in sway yaw z h is positive but the value is about 60 of the value in pure sway thus the vertical acting point of the hull lateral force takes different values according to the maneuvering mode such as oblique moving and turning similar results in deep water were indicated by fukui et al 2016 in shallow water z h changes to negative direction as a whole it is considered that this comes from the effect of not only the lateral force component acting on the hull but also the vertical force component which was neglected in this analysis however the detailed mechanism is not clear at present 4 2 tests for capturing bank effect on hydrodynamic forces to capture the bank effect on the hydrodynamic force characteristics in shallow water ott tests with variation of distance between ship centerline and bank wall were carried out the bank model was arranged on

the fitting results using eqs 4 to 6 a vertical shift is observed in x h and n h with changing η l although y h does not change very much then the hydrodynamic derivatives related to η are shown in table 5 fig 10 shows hydrodynamic force coefficients acting on the ship hull with β 0 when moving parallel to the bank x h is negative i e the resistance acting on the hull with increase of η l the absolute value of x h increases slightly y h i e the bank suction force increases with increase of η l n h is negative i e the bow out moment from the bank acts on the ship hull the shallow water effect on n h is more significant next the vertical acting point of the hull lateral force bank suction force is considered fig 11 shows the roll moment coefficient k h versus the lateral force coefficient y h with β 0 in different water depths inclination of k h to y h means the vertical acting point of the suction force z h k h is roughly proportional to y h mean lines of k h versus y h are drawn in the figure z h is 0 046 in h d 1 5 and 0 027 in h d 1 2 z h is positive in both and this means that the vertical acting point of the suction force is located below the free surface although it was negative in h d 1 2 without the presence of the bank as shown in table 3 when the ship moves in close proximity to the bank the acting point shifts downwards due to the bank effect 5 course stability analysis of the ship close to a bank the course stability of the ship sailing close to a bank is discussed using the hydrodynamic derivatives obtained 5 1 motion equations it is assumed that ship speed u is given and the surge coupling effect is negligible the roll coupling effect is also neglected since the ship speed is slow and the heel roll angle is small then the motion

d 3 d 4 0 27 d 5 d 3 d 2 d 1 d 3 2 d 0 d 4 d 1 2 0 if these conditions are satisfied the course instability theoretically never occurs d 4 d 3 and d 0 become hydrodynamically positive for common ships so that we have to check the sign of d 1 d 2 and d 5 5 2 analysis result the course stability analysis of the pcc sailing close to a bank is carried out using the formulas mentioned above as the hydrodynamic derivatives the measured data obtained in the captive model test mentioned in previous section are used table 6 shows the rudder force and virtual mass coefficients used in the analysis virtual mass coefficient such as m m x m m y and i z j z were determined according to yoshimura 1986 and were assumed to be constant in variation of η 0 l y δ and n δ in the table were determined with reference to the tank test data by sano et al 2014 fig 12 shows the calculation results of y v n v n v y v y η n η and n η y η versus η 0 l which are calculated using eq 14 n v y v means the longitudinal acting point of lateral force in oblique towing condition and n η y η means the longitudinal acting point of the bank suction force in both h d 1 5 and 1 2 absolute values of y v y η and n η increase with increase of η 0 l as a result n η y η also increases change of n η y η to positive direction means that the longitudinal acting point shifts forwards compared with those change of n v y v with increase of η 0 l is small and this value is always positive fig 13 shows calculation results of check helm δ 0 and heading angle ψ 0 v 0 versus η 0 l with increase of η 0 l δ 0 increases and this tendency is more significant in h d 1 2 δ 0 reaches 35 near η 0 l 0 27 in h d 1 2 if the ship sails any closer to the bank wall there is a collision risk with the bank due to insufficient rudder force on the other hand ψ 0 is quite small however it is important to note that the ship stern may come into contact with the bank if the steering is mistaken because the bank suction force and the bow out yaw moment act on the ship hull the reason why δ 0 increases significantly with increase of η 0 l is that n η y η changes significantly with η 0 l and n v y v is positive and almost constant see eq 15 additionally the reason why ψ 0 is smaller than δ 0 by one order of magnitude is that the absolute value of y δ is smaller than that of y v by one order of magnitude mainly where the water depth changes from h d 1 5 to h d 1 2 check helm δ 0 becomes significantly large the helmsman must pay attention to the change for safe navigation fig 14 shows calculation results of d 1 d 2 and 100 d 5 in both h d 1 5 and h d 1 2 for g 1 g 2 0 in h d 1 5 d 2 is always positive d 1 is partially negative and d 5 is fully negative in h d 1 2 d 1 and d 2 are always positive and only d 5 becomes negative when discussing the course stability of ships in proximity of a bank d 5 is the most important this is the same as the analysis result by sano et al 2014 for an inland container ship in case of no rudder control g 1 g 2 0 this ship is course unstable to improve the course instability rudder control gains for autopilot change as follows 1 g 1 g 2 0 no control 2 g 1 g 2 4 control with mild sensitivity 3 g 1 g 2 6 control with high sensitivity according to eda 1971 the control of g 1 g 2 4 is called as control with mild sensitivity and that of g 1 g 2 6 as control with high sensitivity fig 15 shows calculation result of 100 d 5 in both h d 1 5 and h d 1 2 for g 1 g 2 0 100 d 5 is fully negative and this ship is course unstable changing the gains to g 1 g 2 4 and g 1 g 2 6 the line of 100 d 5 shifts vertically upward and the value of 100 d 5 becomes positive for g 1 g 2 4 in h d 1 2 100 d 5 becomes fully positive and the ship is course stable although d 1 was partially negative without rudder control in h d 1 5 as shown in fig 14 d 1 becomes positive by employing the autopilot with small gains 6 concluding remarks in this paper an analysis of the course stability was presented for a pure car carrier pcc in proximity to a bank the analysis is based on the method proposed by sano et al 2014 however a modification is made to the method to treat the problem conventionally for the analysis the hydrodynamic derivatives are required to capture those captive model tests were performed in deep and shallow water oblique towing test ott and circular motion test cmt were conducted with variation of the heel angle of the ship model to know the heel effect of the derivatives further ott was conducted for capturing bank effect on the derivatives using the derivatives obtained the course stability was analyzed for the pcc in bank proximity in h d 1 2 the check helm reaches 35 near η 0 l 0 27 where η 0 is the distance between the ship center line and the bank the helmsman must pay attention to the steering for safe navigation in this situation additionally this ship is course unstable in case of no rudder control in any water depths however the ship becomes course stable by employing the autopilot with gains g 1 g 2 4 which is called as control with mild sensitivity eda 1971 the present analysis method is useful for conventionally assessing course stability of a ship in the proximity of a bank finally it is added that the hydrodynamic derivatives data provided in this study are useful for the maneuvering

22589,in this paper we present and investigate important factors that influence a vessels fuel consumption during operation and what model fidelity that is required to adequately capture these factors in fuel consumption estimations our study focuses on evaluating effect of model fidelity and the methodology used to assess the ship behaviour in operational conditions operational performance is affecting cost of operation and estimations of operational performance is used in design development operational research and as basis for emission analysis affecting decision making at an operational and technical level a comprehensive case study is presented where we compare fuel consumption and engine operational profile for time domain and discrete event simulations and a static statistical model of the factors that have been included in the study variation in propeller loading and consequently propulsion efficiency is the most prominent physical factor for estimation of required power and fuel consumption further the ability to replicate realistic scenarios using simulators has a significant effect on our understanding of how operational and environmental factors affect operational performance 1 introduction shipping although being an energy efficient mode of transport is a significant contributor to global emissions such as green house gases ghg nox sox and pm buhaug et al 2009 corbett et al 2007a eyring et al 2005 klimont et al 2017 which are affecting global climate human health and the environment eyring et al 2010 corbett et al 2007b kampa and castanas 2008 the international maritime organization imo is addressing the negative impact of shipping on global climate human health and the environment by issuing regulations requiring emission reduction such as the nox emission limits of marpol annex iv and the energy efficiency design index eedi several new technologies are being evaluated for use in marine power systems aiming at increasing transport energy efficiency bouman et al 2017 and reducing emissions fujibayashi et al 2013 hiraoka 2016 gregory and confuorto 2012 di natale and carotenuto 2015 evaluating a large number of potential technical solutions require cost effective evaluation methods in addition these methods have to capture the nature of ship operation to provide valuable information on novel system solution performance there are currently promising methods being put forward using data driven statistical methods for increasing the ability to predict the operational performance of a ship yoo and kim 2019 while data driven methods are useful for generating operational performance models of already existing ships the ability to predict effects of changes in a system design is limited as there exists no measurement data for non existing systems improving system solutions depends on an ability to evaluate the effect of design changes of which there are currently limited performance information this is commonly achieved by using mathematical modelling and numerical simulation to predict the behaviour and performance while modelling and simulation is a powerful method enabling the use of computers to predict behaviour and performance of physical artifacts there are still limitations commonly model development requires making simplifications which can affect the validity of the simulation results in the evaluation of novel systems and in design optimization it is common to simplify the effect of the operational conditions and operational decisions such as single load point evaluation song and wei gu 2015 larsen et al 2014 and simplified operational profiles gully et al 2009 the possibility of using data from these simplified analyses to predict a systems performance in operational conditions is limited as the cases used are remote from operational conditions increasing our understanding of the potential of novel systems requires evaluation in an operational context to ensure that solutions do perform according to expectations in realistic operating conditions and not only in theoretical cases lindstad and bø 2018 evaluating a system s operational performance in a seaway is a challenging undertaking this is due to the large number of different domains involved the need for large amounts of information and the difficulty of capturing the physical phenomena sufficiently accurate in a mathematical form that can be calculated within a reasonable time frame seaway performance evaluation depends on describing the operation conditions consisting of waves current and wind the hull and propeller performance in the current sea states and power production with dynamic loads in addition a ship is free to change course making the encountered weather a function of operational choices made at different levels in the organization operating the ship establishing these relationships involves abstraction of relevant phenomena into mathematical models that can be used to predict the performances through either analysis or simulation there are trade offs between model fidelity model development cost required calculation or simulation effort and prediction validity of the model that have to be considered when developing models for operational performance evaluations estimating power demand transmission efficiency and power production efficiency using models of appropriate fidelity balances the need to capture the effect of design variations and the ability to evaluate a high number of design concepts several approaches for modelling operation performance have been used in the literature corbett et al 2009 used still water and a cubic relationship between speed and fuel consumption with constant specific fuel consumption to evaluate the effect of speed reduction on emissions of co2 on a fleet level for the same purpose of evaluating effect of speed reduction on co2 emissions on a fleet level lindstad et al 2011 expanded the still water assumption to include added resistance due to waves when calculating the power demand in addition propeller efficiency as function of vessel speed was included to account for transmission efficiency however added resistance is based on an estimated average significant wave height of 2 5 metres and a fixed specific fuel consumption in the evaluation of different power system setups fuels and hull designs lindstad and bø 2018 further expanded the power production efficiency model to include specific fuel consumption as function of engine power significant wave height was also expanded to a set of expected significant wave heights with fractions of sailing time spent in the different wave conditions in the work on an operational performance prediction model lu et al 2015 used sea trail data to establish the relationship between the power demand and engine power and the test bench specific fuel consumption curve to establish fuel consumption in the work of prpić oršić and faltinsen 2012 estimated the effect of speed loss in a sea way due to added resistance and the effect of wave on the propeller performance however the fuel consumption was based on a constant power assumption with a fixed fuel consumption per day in tillig et al 2017 engine fuel consumption is based on model taking into account the working point of the engine power and rpm with torque limits and rpm limits while different modelling assumptions are used it is difficult based on the available literature to evaluate the importance of the different assumption and whether including additional factors are worth the effort in the present paper we evaluate the effect of model fidelity considering alternative modelling approaches for capturing factors affecting ship operational performance three fundamental aspects are included in the evaluation power demand power transmission efficiency and power production efficiency two models with different fidelity and two simulation methods are compared where a high fidelity time domain model is used for reference the novelty of the paper is the comparison of state of the art models for power demand transmission efficiency and power production efficiency used in operational analysis of effect of system design and operational policies with a state of the art time domain simulation model of the same system the differences will be quantified in a case study where three different operation policies are simulated for 12 voyages equally spaced over one year this paper is organized into six sections the next section addresses the identification of factors relevant for estimating operational performance focusing on fuel consumption section 3 presents the case study and the different models that are to be compared section 4 presents the results focusing on the effect of different factors and the effect of model fidelity section 5 discusses the results in the context of trade offs between prediction validity versus the cost of modelling and simulation and the availability of the different models for representing novel designs finally the work is concluded in section 6 2 estimating fuel consumption in operational conditions fuel consumption is considered to be a variable of special interest from a societal and economic perspective it represents a measure of emission level and costs from a modelling perspective it requires modelling of processes and factors spanning from organizational policies to engine performance at sea this section presents our approach towards modelling ships in operational conditions and estimating fuel consumption first it considers the physical and operational factors which is present in a maritime transportation operation the occurrence and interaction between these factors are discussed and then categorized according to how they affect the fuel consumption three categories are used power demand power transmission efficiency and power generation efficiency which are needed to calculate the fuel consumption further the implementation of the different factors into simulation models are illustrated finally the system is presented in a generic form consisting of the transformation of fuel to transport work and categorization of fuel consumption factors 2 1 fuel consumption factors and domains in the present work the term operational conditions refers to the physical environment the ship operates in i e the wave current and wind conditions encountered by the ship fig 1 shows the major factors for fuel consumption in operational conditions physical factors determine the fuel needed to overcome resistance within a given environmental condition at a given speed they arise from hydrodynamic and mechanical engineering domains and are associated with the technical description of the ship operational factors are linked to the overall objective for the ship to be present at its location carrying a given cargo load these factors arise from human decision making and operational policies impacting the choices made by the ship owner and ship master processes most commonly addressed in operations research maritime transportation is commonly divided into liner industrial and tramp shipping giving rise to varying requirements in term of speed management and schedule meeting these requirements entails choices affect the vessel s behaviour through operational and tactical decisions the different factors are not independent or static and are determined by design the interaction within and between operational and physical factors and the changing condition of the system with time and use 2 2 factor interaction fig 2 shows our model for factor interaction on top we have the operation i e the context for applying the vessel to do a specific mission within a given set of constraints in the area of operation weather conditions are present which affects the power demand through resistance the knowledge of this effect creates a feedback loop in the form of operational reevaluation from which the operation and sea passage behaviour may be altered the interaction between operational considerations and occurring environmental conditions results in a set of sea states and vessel speeds for the operation combining sea state and operation allow us to express vessel resistance and required propulsion power giving us the basis for the operation power demand further propeller thrust is generated at a corresponding efficiency level depending on the propeller loading and interaction from waves and current hence our modelling approach provides a link between operation and fuel consumption spanning from high level operational tasks and decisions to low level physical effects and demand for the power plant 2 3 factor categorization fig 3 shows the system boundaries with fuel and mission as input and transport work as output estimating the conversion of fuel to transport work through a mission depends on determining the power demand the power transmission efficiency and the power generation efficiency environment is included as an input affecting the factors in the three categories and emissions are an unwanted bi product of the process for propulsion power demand is associated with the ability to overcome resistance power production is the process of converting potential energy in the fuel to mechanical energy using a power plant operating in a given condition between power demand and power production is the transfer efficiency process transporting energy from the power plant to the propeller generating thrust and performing transportation work the generic layout of fig 3 is applicable for modelling fuel and energy requirements for all types of ship types and propulsion systems it also serves as a means in the present paper for communicating and discussing the implications and effects of modelling assumptions on fuel consumption estimates 3 case study a comprehensive case study has been conducted to test the impact of the modelling choices and simulation method in operational performance prediction performance evaluation is selected to be carried out by replicating a crossing of the north pacific ocean from tokyo to san francisco this area was chosen to ensure a sufficient simulation length which facilitate the occurrence of multiple weather systems along the route kvlcc2 kim et al 2001 was chosen as the case vessel as it is an academic hull where data is readily available the engine modelled is a wartsila 8rt flex68d rated to 25 040 kw at 95 rpm the vessel is equipped with a fixed pitch propeller where the design has been adapted to the engine and the hull 3 1 model descriptions as discussed in section 2 there are several factors that affects the power demand the power production and the power transmission in this section models used in the case study for capturing these factors are presented 3 1 1 model 1 model 1 is based on a transient diesel engine model typically used to evaluate the effect of transient loads on engine performance rakopoulos and giakoumis 2006 power demand is calculated by a vessel model and a propeller model the propeller inflow is estimated by using ship stern motions roas the raos are calculated using linear strip theory utilizing potential theory and pressure integration using shipx veres developed by sintef ocean previously marintek the propeller is represented by a one quadrant model with thrust and torque coefficient curves estimated by using the open source openprop software which is based on lattice lifting line theory javafoil hepperle 2018 has been used to calculate frictional drag effect of ship motion and inflow on propeller torque and thrust has been included according to taskar et al 2016 the engine model is a dynamic model developed by yum et al 2017 capable of capturing interactions with the varying propeller load and predicting performance in dynamic loads introducing dynamic models significantly increases the information demand and the computational efforts required to estimate the performance the vessel is modelled using a one dimensional vessel model where only surge motion is considered added resistance has been calculated using strip theory utilizing potential theory and pressure integration also by using shipx veres different significant wave heights hs peak wave periods tp and encounter heading combinations α has been used for calculating added resistance in irregular waves with the pierson moskowitz wave spectrum added resistance coefficients has been calculated according to the method by loukakis and sclavounos 1978 using shipx veres fig 4 shows the details of the model and the variables exchanged between the different sub models model 1 is dependent on a sub model for replicating a sea passage generating the sea state encountered based on position time and prevailing weather the simplest approach would be to select a great circle route however such an approach to sea passage modelling would not take into account the freedom a ship and its captain have to select routes that avoid harsh weather etc sandvik et al 2018 addresses the importance of active speed and course decision making for understanding the performance of ships during sea passage and proposes a model for controlling sea passage behaviour in simulation models the model adjusts vessel heading and speed as a function of two variables target speed v 0 and schedule delay cost rate κ the objective function minimizes voyage fuel consumption and delay costs taking into consideration weather within a 72 h horizon and estimated ship performance wave conditions are based on hindcast data using the ecmwf era5 database ecmwf era5 2018 an assessment of three wave hindcasts including the era5 predecessor era interim has been carried out by campos and soares 2016 for the north atlantic which concluded that the data shows minor differences in non extreme situations while there are significant differences in extreme situations for the objective of this paper discrepancies in the extreme situations will have limited impact on the predictions as the time spent in extreme situations is very limited compared to the time spent in non extreme situations campos and soares also states that era interim is the preferred choice for non extreme analysis the impact of wind and current has not been considered in this case study 3 1 2 model 2 model 2 is based on static performance estimation using still water engine performance curves and power transmission efficiency estimated as a function of vessel speed only with a model suggested by lindstad and bø 2018 1 η d η d j k v v d where η d is the propulsion efficiency η d is the propulsion efficiency at design speed and v d is the design speed j and k are constants used to fit the efficiency where j k 1 the fuel consumption is calculated based on the still water specific fuel consumption curve from model 1 propulsion efficiency η d has been fitted to the propulsion efficiency of the model 1 in still water conditions power demand is calculated with the same model as in model 1 with both still water resistance and added resistance due to waves fig 5 shows the details of the model and the variables exchanged between the different sub models model 2 does not include any method for generating individual voyages therefore two approaches for estimating encountered sea states are used in the first approach voyage data from model 1 is used to calculate still water and wave added resistance based on observed significant wave heights wave periods vessel speed and wave encounter angle in the second approach added resistance has been included by estimating expected sea states and power demands using a static statistical approach based on wave distribution parameters from dnvgl 2017 presented in table c 5 fig 6 presents the relationship between average speed and estimated average engine power demand taking into account the effect of expected speed loss this approach reduces the problem of estimating fuel consumption to a problem where the only needed inputs are vessel speed and voyage distance to enable comparison of model fidelities and not route selection the average vessel speeds and voyage distances from model 1 is used as input to model 2 3 2 sea passage scenarios the sea passage sub model has been used to include three sea passage scenarios with v 0 and κ values as presented in table 1 the scenarios have been designed to represent different operation policies the low cost low velocity lclv scenario parameters are determined to allow speed and route variation which is expected to result in a low engine power demand high cost low velocity hclv is a scenario where the arrival time is stricter than for lclv however the low target speed is likely to limit the need for high power demands for the majority of the time the high cost high velocity hchv is set to test the fuel consumption and power estimates at a likely high power demand scenario the three cases span the majority of the relevant engine loading range allowing us to investigate the influence of model fidelity on estimates at different engine load intervals as seasons affect prevailing weather conditions and consequently the operational sea state conditions it was selected to include all seasons in the case study twelve voyage start dates were selected with historic weather data from 2016 the start dates are the 2 for each month of the year table 1 lists the input parameters describing the operational scenarios used in the case study 3 3 simulation two simulation methods are compared in the case study time domain and discrete event model 1 is simulated in both time domain and in discrete event while model 2 is only simulated in discrete event using model 1 in a discrete event simulation requires reducing the dynamic model into a table look up model while such a model reduction can reduce the result validity it contributes to a significant simulation speed increase fig 7 shows the different implementation of the different models both with regard to simulation method and information flow from model 1 to model 2 3 3 1 time domain simulation the complete voyage is simulated using model 1 in the time domain with discrete updates of sea states and ship control inputs based on the sea passage controller presented in section 3 1 1 the combination of the discrete event sea passage model and model 1 is presented in fig 8 the voyage controller determines the required speed which is used as a set point to a vessel speed controller setting the engine rpm at discrete times the weather is updated by the weather look up module weather is given as an array of hs tp and encounter angle to calculate hull resistance and propeller performance 3 3 2 discrete event simulation a discrete event formulation is used to replicate the voyage utilizing the sea passage controller and a table look up representation of the dynamic model the process of generating the table look up and running the simulation is presented in fig 9 the table look up model is generated before the voyage simulation by running the time domain simulation model for a selection of sea states encounter headings and vessel speeds this generates a matrix of engine performance as a function of hs tp encounter angle and requested vessel speed time domain simulations for the table generation are run until steady state operation is achieved linear interpolation is used to estimate power system performance of the encountered sea states during the voyage during the voyage simulation calls to the table look up module are the same as for the time domain model headings and engine speeds ranged from 65 rpm to the maximum rpm of 95 and headings from 0 to 180 degrees with 45 degree increments wave conditions are presented in fig 10 where hs and tp combinations are based wave scatter data from dnvgl 2017 in addition to covering the most likely hs and tp combinations some extreme values are also included to remove the need for extrapolation in extreme weather situations total number of simulation runs for generation of table look up matrix became 6435 4 results in this section results of the case study are presented first a base line for comparison using model 1 time domain simulation results is presented for power demand power transmission power production and fuel consumption then a comparison of how the two base models and three of the model implementations model 1 td and de and model 2 ea will be compared with regards to effect of model fidelity lastly a comparison of all the models and model implementations is presented where predictions on total fuel consumption and fuel consumption per sailed distance are evaluated 4 1 factors affecting fuel consumption estimation 4 1 1 power demand power demand has been evaluated as function of vessel speed the comparison is presented in fig 11 where the lclv sea passage scenario is found in fig 11 a hclv in fig 11 b and hchv in fig 11 c the scatter data is augmented with an average and a 90 confidence interval for power demand within seven vessel speeds intervals based on empirical distributions estimated power demand for a selection of sea states assuming head waves is included for reference the same load dynamics and speed transients can be observed in the power demand data as scatter points outside the requested speeds in addition to the grouping on the voyage controller requested speeds and random scattering due to transients there are observable lines of scatter points between the speed groupings at high power demand these lines are observable in both the hclv and hchv sea state scenarios these scatter points are caused by involuntary speed loss where the engine and propeller are not able to deliver enough thrust to overcome the resistance for a required speed as with the propulsion efficiency the lowest errors are found at and above the vessel speed with the highest number of observations 4 1 2 power transmission the power transmission efficiency has been evaluated as function of vessel speed observed efficiencies in the simulation results for the different sea passage scenarios are compared to efficiency curves for different wave conditions assuming head waves the comparison is plotted in fig 12 where data for the lclv scenario is given in fig 12 a the hclv scenario in fig 12 b and the hchv scenario in fig 12 c the scatter data from the time domain simulation of model 1 is augmented with an average and a 90 confidence interval for propulsion efficiency with seven vessel speeds intervals based on empirical distributions in addition the distributions of observed vessel speeds is included in a histogram for each sea passage scenario these vessel speed observations and distributions are applicable to all data presented with vessel speed at the x axis in section 4 1 in the scatter plot observations are grouped around speeds set by the voyage controller which have a 1 knot resolution there are also some observations in between the requested speeds and below and above the expected band of propulsion efficiency this is due to the dynamic load and transients between requested speeds and the way propulsion efficiency is calculated propulsion efficiency is calculated based on the engine power divided by the power demand in situations where the engine power drops rapidly the inertia of the ship causes a much slower vessel speed reduction this results in an increased propulsion efficiency as the power demand is virtually unchanged in the time it takes for the engine power to drop significantly when comparing the error between a calm water propeller performance as function of speed and the observed efficiencies with the distribution of observations in relation to vessel speed we find that the errors are at its smallest at and above the vessel speeds with the highest number of observations 4 1 3 power production combining the power demand and propulsion efficiency gives the required engine power the engine power scatter data is presented as function of vessel speed in fig 13 with sea passage scenario lclv in fig 13 a hclv in fig 13 b and hchv in fig 13 c the scatter data is augmented with an average and a 90 confidence interval for engine power within seven vessel speeds intervals based on empirical distributions the estimated engine powers for a selection of sea states assuming head waves and propulsion efficiency a function of propeller speed and vessel velocity are included for reference as with the propulsion efficiency and power demand the lowest errors are found at and above the vessel speed with the highest number of observations 4 1 4 fuel consumption as the main performance indicator used in this case study is fuel consumption per sailed distance a fuel consumption plot comparable to those of the factors influencing fuel consumption is presented in fig 14 sea passage scenario lclv is presented in fig 14 a hclv in fig 14 b and hchv in fig 14 c the scatter data is augmented with an average and a 90 confidence interval for fuel consumption within 7 vessel speeds intervals based on empirical distributions estimated fuel consumption for a selection of sea states assuming head waves based on a test bench propeller curve engine efficiency is also included to enable evaluation of the importance of encountered sea states on the fuel consumption the involuntary speed loss scatter data line is also observed in the fuel consumption plots here the line shows an increase with reduced speeds which is expected as the engine power is constant giving the same fuel consumption per time unit while the distance covered is reduced comparing still water fuel consumption with observed fuel consumption in the simulation results highlight a significant discrepancy as with the propulsion efficiency power demand and engine power the lowest errors are found at and above the vessel speeds with the highest number of observations 4 1 5 specific fuel consumption specific fuel consumption g kwh is a common way of evaluating power production efficiency the effect of operational conditions of specific fuel consumption and engine power distribution is compared for the three sea passage scenarios the comparison is plotted in fig 15 where data for the lclv scenario is given in fig 15 a the hclv scenario in fig 15 b and the hchv scenario in fig 15 c the scatter data from the time domain simulation of model 1 is augmented with an average and a 90 confidence interval for specific fuel consumption values within 16 engine power intervals based on empirical distributions engine power distributions of observed engine power are included in a histogram for each sea passage scenario 4 2 comparing model fidelities in this section a comparison of the average and the 90 confidence interval for model 1 td model 1 de and model 2 ea is carried out observations for all sea passage scenarios are combined to generate the underlying data sets fig 16 compares the observed specific fuel consumption as model 2 is based on the engine test bench propeller curve there is no confidence interval in addition to the comparison of specific fuel consumption distributions for the different models a histogram representing the observed engine powers for all sea passage scenarios is also included fig 17 compares propulsion efficiency 17 a power demand 17 b engine power 17 c and fuel consumption per sailed distance 17 d fig 17 a also includes the vessel speed observation distributions for all scenarios combined there are only vessel distributions available for model 1 td and model 2 de model 2 ea vessel speeds are based on the vessel speeds of model 1 de the time series of different performance indicators for the voyage simulations with departure in march are included in fig 18 as an example of how the different models deviate at low load and high load during a voyage an accompanying data set presenting the voyage and sea states encountered is presented in fig 19 where model 2 is based on the voyage of model 1 de 4 2 1 comparing time domain and discrete event voyage simulation time series for model 1 td and model 1 de for all three march sea passage scenarios are presented in fig 19 where data for the voyage controller output and resulting route with encountered operational conditions are presented the voyage control data are vessel speed and course settings data on encountered operational conditions are included in the form hs and positions in the form of latitudes and longitudes in addition there are two plots comparing model 1 td and de by plotting differences in speed and course between the two models the spikes observed in the speed difference plot are due to the speed transients occurring in model 1 td changing vessel speed in the td model by one knot takes about 15 min while it is instant in the de model there are no dynamics in the course changes so spikes observed in the course difference chart are due to differences in temporal resolutions and the exact time of course change it can be observed that the differences in speed policy and route occur towards the end of the voyage and that the two models handle speed loss differently in some instances data for all voyages and all sea passage scenarios in the form of sailed distances and average speed are presented in table 2 4 2 2 operational performance prediction the operational performance in this case study is based on fuel consumption either total fuel consumed during a voyage or the fuel consumption per sailed distance total fuel consumption for the voyages are presented in table 3 model 2 ss is also included although the method is not intended for use on a single voyage this is due to the estimated power demand being based on static statistical approach meaning that it is only appropriate to compare the sum over a year as it is not relevant for single voyages average fuel consumption per sailed distance is presented in table 4 where the total fuel consumption for a voyage is divided by the distance sailed 5 discussion up to this point we have presented model details case specifics and simulation results in this section we discuss the meaning of the results and potential implications of the findings as this case study has been carried out for a large vlcc tanker all observations made may not be applicable to other types of vessel other results may also be expected for other types of vessels such as container ships operating at higher speeds with cargo that are more susceptible to damage and slenderer hulls that behaves differently in waves however the considerations on how operational performance prediction both depends on models used and how the evaluation is carried out are relevant for all ship categories 5 1 the influence of the different factors affecting fuel consumption estimates from the time domain simulation results it is evident that operation in waves has an impact on estimating the fuel consumption however the impact varies for the different factors the effect of operation in waves and transients have some impact on engine specific fuel oil consumption however the difference is very small compared to the still water specific fuel oil consumption power transmission does however have a significant impact on fuel consumption in waves which can be seen in table 3 comparing model 1 de and model 2 ea in waves the power transmission efficiency changes significantly from that of still water operation which affect both the required engine power and at which specific fuel consumption the power is produced although all models use the same estimate for still water resistance and added resistance due to waves it is evident that the method of including waves into the estimation has a significant effect of fuel consumption estimation when comparing the total fuel consumption of model 2 ea and model 2 ss in table 3 5 2 model comparison in comparing the models model 1 td functions as the reference the main difference between model 1 and model 2 is that model 2 requires input on encountered operational conditions and voyage particulars in this case study these data have been provided by model 1 de to ensure that the model comparisons are based on the same voyages however additional differences between the models are expected if other methods for estimating voyages are used for creating the required input to model 2 sandvik et al 2018 in this section mainly model 1 td model 1 de and model 2 ea are compared as model 2 ss only produces data relevant when comparing fuel consumption over a year important reasons for the observed differences between model 1 td and de are the errors introduced in both the curve fitting needed to create the table lookup model and the linear interpolation performed to estimate performance errors in curve fitting are especially evident in the estimation of the specific fuel consumption in fig 16 these errors are limited in the estimation of power demand see fig 11 while they are observable in both estimation of propulsion efficiency see fig 12 engine power see fig 13 and fuel consumption per sailed distance see fig 14 however the differences are not significant in the operation points which have the bulk of observations see the histogram in fig 12 the result is that the overall differences between model 1 td and de are small when comparing total fuel consumption or fuel consumption per sailed distance see tables 3 and 4 another source of difference between model 1 td and de is the effect of accumulating difference in the sailed route due to speed change transients and difference in estimating speed loss in this case study transients when changing speed take about 1000 s which results in a difference in position in addition the de model uses simplified estimates for speed loss while speed loss of the td model is part of the simulation if the difference gets large or the differences in cost estimates for different route alternatives are small this can result model 1 td and de sailing different routes this effect gives a bias when using the td model as the performance estimate of the voyage controller is not equal to what the ship does the effect of this bias would become more pronounced for longer voyages when comparing model 1 and 2 it is most relevant to compare model 1 de and model 2 ea as the ea model uses the same route as the de model the use of still water specific fuel consumption curve with fuel consumption as function of engine power in model 2 ea is based on the data in fig 16 a reasonable assumption time series for the voyages carried out in march seen in fig 18 show that this assumption is reasonable as the specific fuel consumption curve of model 2 ea have less deviation from model 1 td than model 1 de however simplifying the propulsion efficiency to a function of speed only introduces significant differences compared to model 1 de as seen in table 3 this simplification leads to a significant shift in the peak of the observed engine powers seen in fig 15 another area of comparison of the different models is the required modelling and simulation effort model 1 is based on high fidelity models of the engine system propulsion system hull and hydrodynamics such models are time consuming to develop and require significant amount of information that is challenging to obtain especially in an early design phase tillig et al 2018 the simulation effort both for the time domain model and the model reduction is significant compared to the fast calculations required for model 2 currently it is common to use the approach of model 2 in higher level estimations of operational performance applications such as weather routing zaccone et al 2018 voyage optimization lu et al 2015 bottom up emission estimation kilic and tzannatos 2014 in these cases where the goal is just to evaluate an already available system where data is easily available engine models such as the still water specific fuel consumption curve of model 2 are reasonable in this work the focus is however on operational performance evaluation in the context of evaluating novel system design solutions while the goal is to always use as simple models as possible while still capture the effect of design changes it might not be achievable to use simple models such as model 2 for more advanced systems designed to satisfy eedi requirements including pti pto waste heat recovery emission abatement etc a still water specific fuel consumption curve may not adequately describe the system performance at all times other aspects that need to be taken into account is whether the system performance is dependent on the history of the system or if it is by all practical considerations only dependent on a very short history a diesel engine has time constants dictated by the turbo charger and thermal transients however these time constants are very short compared to a voyage and can in most cases be ignored a hybrid system with energy storage based on batteries have longer time constants and is thereby dependent on a longer history which may affect decision making and performance 6 conclusions the case study designed to evaluate four ship system model fidelity levels for operational performance uncovered that model fidelity affected results both due to differences in how different factors had been modelled and how the different models were simulated the main factor affecting performance in operational conditions was found to be the propulsion efficiency estimation dynamic operation of the marine power system was investigated and found to be of less importance when estimating operational performance the difference between model 1 td and de was found to be negligible considering the significant simulation effort required for the td model compared to the de model however model fidelity required does not only depend on the ability to provide useful prediction it also depends on the availability of information that can be used for less simulation intensive models this is illustrated in the case study where all models rely on information from model 1 td for model development through model reduction to either a table lookup model or for the still water specific fuel consumption curve acknowledgements this work was carried out at sfi smart maritime which is mainly supported by the research council of norway through

22589,in this paper we present and investigate important factors that influence a vessels fuel consumption during operation and what model fidelity that is required to adequately capture these factors in fuel consumption estimations our study focuses on evaluating effect of model fidelity and the methodology used to assess the ship behaviour in operational conditions operational performance is affecting cost of operation and estimations of operational performance is used in design development operational research and as basis for emission analysis affecting decision making at an operational and technical level a comprehensive case study is presented where we compare fuel consumption and engine operational profile for time domain and discrete event simulations and a static statistical model of the factors that have been included in the study variation in propeller loading and consequently propulsion efficiency is the most prominent physical factor for estimation of required power and fuel consumption further the ability to replicate realistic scenarios using simulators has a significant effect on our understanding of how operational and environmental factors affect operational performance 1 introduction shipping although being an energy efficient mode of transport is a significant contributor to global emissions such as green house gases ghg nox sox and pm buhaug et al 2009 corbett et al 2007a eyring et al 2005 klimont et al 2017 which are affecting global climate human health and the environment eyring et al 2010 corbett et al 2007b kampa and castanas 2008 the international maritime organization imo is addressing the negative impact of shipping on global climate human health and the environment by issuing regulations requiring emission reduction such as the nox emission limits of marpol annex iv and the energy efficiency design index eedi several new technologies are being evaluated for use in marine power systems aiming at increasing transport energy efficiency bouman et al 2017 and reducing emissions fujibayashi et al 2013 hiraoka 2016 gregory and confuorto 2012 di natale and carotenuto 2015 evaluating a large number of potential technical solutions require cost effective evaluation methods in addition these methods have to capture the nature of ship operation to provide valuable information on novel system solution performance there are currently promising methods being put forward using data driven statistical methods for increasing the ability to predict the operational performance of a ship yoo and kim 2019 while data driven methods are useful for generating operational performance models of already existing ships the ability to predict effects of changes in a system design is limited as there exists no measurement data for non existing systems improving system solutions depends on an ability to evaluate the effect of design changes of which there are currently limited performance information this is commonly achieved by using mathematical modelling and numerical simulation to predict the behaviour and performance while modelling and simulation is a powerful method enabling the use of computers to predict behaviour and performance of physical artifacts there are still limitations commonly model development requires making simplifications which can affect the validity of the simulation results in the evaluation of novel systems and in design optimization it is common to simplify the effect of the operational conditions and operational decisions such as single load point evaluation song and wei gu 2015 larsen et al 2014 and simplified operational profiles gully et al 2009 the possibility of using data from these simplified analyses to predict a systems performance in operational conditions is limited as the cases used are remote from operational conditions increasing our understanding of the potential of novel systems requires evaluation in an operational context to ensure that solutions do perform according to expectations in realistic operating conditions and not only in theoretical cases lindstad and bø 2018 evaluating a system s operational performance in a seaway is a challenging undertaking this is due to the large number of different domains involved the need for large amounts of information and the difficulty of capturing the physical phenomena sufficiently accurate in a mathematical form that can be calculated within a reasonable time frame seaway performance evaluation depends on describing the operation conditions consisting of waves current and wind the hull and propeller performance in the current sea states and power production with dynamic loads in addition a ship is free to change course making the encountered weather a function of operational choices made at different levels in the organization operating the ship establishing these relationships involves abstraction of relevant phenomena into mathematical models that can be used to predict the performances through either analysis or simulation there are trade offs between model fidelity model development cost required calculation or simulation effort and prediction validity of the model that have to be considered when developing models for operational performance evaluations estimating power demand transmission efficiency and power production efficiency using models of appropriate fidelity balances the need to capture the effect of design variations and the ability to evaluate a high number of design concepts several approaches for modelling operation performance have been used in the literature corbett et al 2009 used still water and a cubic relationship between speed and fuel consumption with constant specific fuel consumption to evaluate the effect of speed reduction on emissions of co2 on a fleet level for the same purpose of evaluating effect of speed reduction on co2 emissions on a fleet level lindstad et al 2011 expanded the still water assumption to include added resistance due to waves when calculating the power demand in addition propeller efficiency as function of vessel speed was included to account for transmission efficiency however added resistance is based on an estimated average significant wave height of 2 5 metres and a fixed specific fuel consumption in the evaluation of different power system setups fuels and hull designs lindstad and bø 2018 further expanded the power production efficiency model to include specific fuel consumption as function of engine power significant wave height was also expanded to a set of expected significant wave heights with fractions of sailing time spent in the different wave conditions in the work on an operational performance prediction model lu et al 2015 used sea trail data to establish the relationship between the power demand and engine power and the test bench specific fuel consumption curve to establish fuel consumption in the work of prpić oršić and faltinsen 2012 estimated the effect of speed loss in a sea way due to added resistance and the effect of wave on the propeller performance however the fuel consumption was based on a constant power assumption with a fixed fuel consumption per day in tillig et al 2017 engine fuel consumption is based on model taking into account the working point of the engine power and rpm with torque limits and rpm limits while different modelling assumptions are used it is difficult based on the available literature to evaluate the importance of the different assumption and whether including additional factors are worth the effort in the present paper we evaluate the effect of model fidelity considering alternative modelling approaches for capturing factors affecting ship operational performance three fundamental aspects are included in the evaluation power demand power transmission efficiency and power production efficiency two models with different fidelity and two simulation methods are compared where a high fidelity time domain model is used for reference the novelty of the paper is the comparison of state of the art models for power demand transmission efficiency and power production efficiency used in operational analysis of effect of system design and operational policies with a state of the art time domain simulation model of the same system the differences will be quantified in a case study where three different operation policies are simulated for 12 voyages equally spaced over one year this paper is organized into six sections the next section addresses the identification of factors relevant for estimating operational performance focusing on fuel consumption section 3 presents the case study and the different models that are to be compared section 4 presents the results focusing on the effect of different factors and the effect of model fidelity section 5 discusses the results in the context of trade offs between prediction validity versus the cost of modelling and simulation and the availability of the different models for representing novel designs finally the work is concluded in section 6 2 estimating fuel consumption in operational conditions fuel consumption is considered to be a variable of special interest from a societal and economic perspective it represents a measure of emission level and costs from a modelling perspective it requires modelling of processes and factors spanning from organizational policies to engine performance at sea this section presents our approach towards modelling ships in operational conditions and estimating fuel consumption first it considers the physical and operational factors which is present in a maritime transportation operation the occurrence and interaction between these factors are discussed and then categorized according to how they affect the fuel consumption three categories are used power demand power transmission efficiency and power generation efficiency which are needed to calculate the fuel consumption further the implementation of the different factors into simulation models are illustrated finally the system is presented in a generic form consisting of the transformation of fuel to transport work and categorization of fuel consumption factors 2 1 fuel consumption factors and domains in the present work the term operational conditions refers to the physical environment the ship operates in i e the wave current and wind conditions encountered by the ship fig 1 shows the major factors for fuel consumption in operational conditions physical factors determine the fuel needed to overcome resistance within a given environmental condition at a given speed they arise from hydrodynamic and mechanical engineering domains and are associated with the technical description of the ship operational factors are linked to the overall objective for the ship to be present at its location carrying a given cargo load these factors arise from human decision making and operational policies impacting the choices made by the ship owner and ship master processes most commonly addressed in operations research maritime transportation is commonly divided into liner industrial and tramp shipping giving rise to varying requirements in term of speed management and schedule meeting these requirements entails choices affect the vessel s behaviour through operational and tactical decisions the different factors are not independent or static and are determined by design the interaction within and between operational and physical factors and the changing condition of the system with time and use 2 2 factor interaction fig 2 shows our model for factor interaction on top we have the operation i e the context for applying the vessel to do a specific mission within a given set of constraints in the area of operation weather conditions are present which affects the power demand through resistance the knowledge of this effect creates a feedback loop in the form of operational reevaluation from which the operation and sea passage behaviour may be altered the interaction between operational considerations and occurring environmental conditions results in a set of sea states and vessel speeds for the operation combining sea state and operation allow us to express vessel resistance and required propulsion power giving us the basis for the operation power demand further propeller thrust is generated at a corresponding efficiency level depending on the propeller loading and interaction from waves and current hence our modelling approach provides a link between operation and fuel consumption spanning from high level operational tasks and decisions to low level physical effects and demand for the power plant 2 3 factor categorization fig 3 shows the system boundaries with fuel and mission as input and transport work as output estimating the conversion of fuel to transport work through a mission depends on determining the power demand the power transmission efficiency and the power generation efficiency environment is included as an input affecting the factors in the three categories and emissions are an unwanted bi product of the process for propulsion power demand is associated with the ability to overcome resistance power production is the process of converting potential energy in the fuel to mechanical energy using a power plant operating in a given condition between power demand and power production is the transfer efficiency process transporting energy from the power plant to the propeller generating thrust and performing transportation work the generic layout of fig 3 is applicable for modelling fuel and energy requirements for all types of ship types and propulsion systems it also serves as a means in the present paper for communicating and discussing the implications and effects of modelling assumptions on fuel consumption estimates 3 case study a comprehensive case study has been conducted to test the impact of the modelling choices and simulation method in operational performance prediction performance evaluation is selected to be carried out by replicating a crossing of the north pacific ocean from tokyo to san francisco this area was chosen to ensure a sufficient simulation length which facilitate the occurrence of multiple weather systems along the route kvlcc2 kim et al 2001 was chosen as the case vessel as it is an academic hull where data is readily available the engine modelled is a wartsila 8rt flex68d rated to 25 040 kw at 95 rpm the vessel is equipped with a fixed pitch propeller where the design has been adapted to the engine and the hull 3 1 model descriptions as discussed in section 2 there are several factors that affects the power demand the power production and the power transmission in this section models used in the case study for capturing these factors are presented 3 1 1 model 1 model 1 is based on a transient diesel engine model typically used to evaluate the effect of transient loads on engine performance rakopoulos and giakoumis 2006 power demand is calculated by a vessel model and a propeller model the propeller inflow is estimated by using ship stern motions roas the raos are calculated using linear strip theory utilizing potential theory and pressure integration using shipx veres developed by sintef ocean previously marintek the propeller is represented by a one quadrant model with thrust and torque coefficient curves estimated by using the open source openprop software which is based on lattice lifting line theory javafoil hepperle 2018 has been used to calculate frictional drag effect of ship motion and inflow on propeller torque and thrust has been included according to taskar et al 2016 the engine model is a dynamic model developed by yum et al 2017 capable of capturing interactions with the varying propeller load and predicting performance in dynamic loads introducing dynamic models significantly increases the information demand and the computational efforts required to estimate the performance the vessel is modelled using a one dimensional vessel model where only surge motion is considered added resistance has been calculated using strip theory utilizing potential theory and pressure integration also by using shipx veres different significant wave heights hs peak wave periods tp and encounter heading combinations α has been used for calculating added resistance in irregular waves with the pierson moskowitz wave spectrum added resistance coefficients has been calculated according to the method by loukakis and sclavounos 1978 using shipx veres fig 4 shows the details of the model and the variables exchanged between the different sub models model 1 is dependent on a sub model for replicating a sea passage generating the sea state encountered based on position time and prevailing weather the simplest approach would be to select a great circle route however such an approach to sea passage modelling would not take into account the freedom a ship and its captain have to select routes that avoid harsh weather etc sandvik et al 2018 addresses the importance of active speed and course decision making for understanding the performance of ships during sea passage and proposes a model for controlling sea passage behaviour in simulation models the model adjusts vessel heading and speed as a function of two variables target speed v 0 and schedule delay cost rate κ the objective function minimizes voyage fuel consumption and delay costs taking into consideration weather within a 72 h horizon and estimated ship performance wave conditions are based on hindcast data using the ecmwf era5 database ecmwf era5 2018 an assessment of three wave hindcasts including the era5 predecessor era interim has been carried out by campos and soares 2016 for the north atlantic which concluded that the data shows minor differences in non extreme situations while there are significant differences in extreme situations for the objective of this paper discrepancies in the extreme situations will have limited impact on the predictions as the time spent in extreme situations is very limited compared to the time spent in non extreme situations campos and soares also states that era interim is the preferred choice for non extreme analysis the impact of wind and current has not been considered in this case study 3 1 2 model 2 model 2 is based on static performance estimation using still water engine performance curves and power transmission efficiency estimated as a function of vessel speed only with a model suggested by lindstad and bø 2018 1 η d η d j k v v d where η d is the propulsion efficiency η d is the propulsion efficiency at design speed and v d is the design speed j and k are constants used to fit the efficiency where j k 1 the fuel consumption is calculated based on the still water specific fuel consumption curve from model 1 propulsion efficiency η d has been fitted to the propulsion efficiency of the model 1 in still water conditions power demand is calculated with the same model as in model 1 with both still water resistance and added resistance due to waves fig 5 shows the details of the model and the variables exchanged between the different sub models model 2 does not include any method for generating individual voyages therefore two approaches for estimating encountered sea states are used in the first approach voyage data from model 1 is used to calculate still water and wave added resistance based on observed significant wave heights wave periods vessel speed and wave encounter angle in the second approach added resistance has been included by estimating expected sea states and power demands using a static statistical approach based on wave distribution parameters from dnvgl 2017 presented in table c 5 fig 6 presents the relationship between average speed and estimated average engine power demand taking into account the effect of expected speed loss this approach reduces the problem of estimating fuel consumption to a problem where the only needed inputs are vessel speed and voyage distance to enable comparison of model fidelities and not route selection the average vessel speeds and voyage distances from model 1 is used as input to model 2 3 2 sea passage scenarios the sea passage sub model has been used to include three sea passage scenarios with v 0 and κ values as presented in table 1 the scenarios have been designed to represent different operation policies the low cost low velocity lclv scenario parameters are determined to allow speed and route variation which is expected to result in a low engine power demand high cost low velocity hclv is a scenario where the arrival time is stricter than for lclv however the low target speed is likely to limit the need for high power demands for the majority of the time the high cost high velocity hchv is set to test the fuel consumption and power estimates at a likely high power demand scenario the three cases span the majority of the relevant engine loading range allowing us to investigate the influence of model fidelity on estimates at different engine load intervals as seasons affect prevailing weather conditions and consequently the operational sea state conditions it was selected to include all seasons in the case study twelve voyage start dates were selected with historic weather data from 2016 the start dates are the 2 for each month of the year table 1 lists the input parameters describing the operational scenarios used in the case study 3 3 simulation two simulation methods are compared in the case study time domain and discrete event model 1 is simulated in both time domain and in discrete event while model 2 is only simulated in discrete event using model 1 in a discrete event simulation requires reducing the dynamic model into a table look up model while such a model reduction can reduce the result validity it contributes to a significant simulation speed increase fig 7 shows the different implementation of the different models both with regard to simulation method and information flow from model 1 to model 2 3 3 1 time domain simulation the complete voyage is simulated using model 1 in the time domain with discrete updates of sea states and ship control inputs based on the sea passage controller presented in section 3 1 1 the combination of the discrete event sea passage model and model 1 is presented in fig 8 the voyage controller determines the required speed which is used as a set point to a vessel speed controller setting the engine rpm at discrete times the weather is updated by the weather look up module weather is given as an array of hs tp and encounter angle to calculate hull resistance and propeller performance 3 3 2 discrete event simulation a discrete event formulation is used to replicate the voyage utilizing the sea passage controller and a table look up representation of the dynamic model the process of generating the table look up and running the simulation is presented in fig 9 the table look up model is generated before the voyage simulation by running the time domain simulation model for a selection of sea states encounter headings and vessel speeds this generates a matrix of engine performance as a function of hs tp encounter angle and requested vessel speed time domain simulations for the table generation are run until steady state operation is achieved linear interpolation is used to estimate power system performance of the encountered sea states during the voyage during the voyage simulation calls to the table look up module are the same as for the time domain model headings and engine speeds ranged from 65 rpm to the maximum rpm of 95 and headings from 0 to 180 degrees with 45 degree increments wave conditions are presented in fig 10 where hs and tp combinations are based wave scatter data from dnvgl 2017 in addition to covering the most likely hs and tp combinations some extreme values are also included to remove the need for extrapolation in extreme weather situations total number of simulation runs for generation of table look up matrix became 6435 4 results in this section results of the case study are presented first a base line for comparison using model 1 time domain simulation results is presented for power demand power transmission power production and fuel consumption then a comparison of how the two base models and three of the model implementations model 1 td and de and model 2 ea will be compared with regards to effect of model fidelity lastly a comparison of all the models and model implementations is presented where predictions on total fuel consumption and fuel consumption per sailed distance are evaluated 4 1 factors affecting fuel consumption estimation 4 1 1 power demand power demand has been evaluated as function of vessel speed the comparison is presented in fig 11 where the lclv sea passage scenario is found in fig 11 a hclv in fig 11 b and hchv in fig 11 c the scatter data is augmented with an average and a 90 confidence interval for power demand within seven vessel speeds intervals based on empirical distributions estimated power demand for a selection of sea states assuming head waves is included for reference the same load dynamics and speed transients can be observed in the power demand data as scatter points outside the requested speeds in addition to the grouping on the voyage controller requested speeds and random scattering due to transients there are observable lines of scatter points between the speed groupings at high power demand these lines are observable in both the hclv and hchv sea state scenarios these scatter points are caused by involuntary speed loss where the engine and propeller are not able to deliver enough thrust to overcome the resistance for a required speed as with the propulsion efficiency the lowest errors are found at and above the vessel speed with the highest number of observations 4 1 2 power transmission the power transmission efficiency has been evaluated as function of vessel speed observed efficiencies in the simulation results for the different sea passage scenarios are compared to efficiency curves for different wave conditions assuming head waves the comparison is plotted in fig 12 where data for the lclv scenario is given in fig 12 a the hclv scenario in fig 12 b and the hchv scenario in fig 12 c the scatter data from the time domain simulation of model 1 is augmented with an average and a 90 confidence interval for propulsion efficiency with seven vessel speeds intervals based on empirical distributions in addition the distributions of observed vessel speeds is included in a histogram for each sea passage scenario these vessel speed observations and distributions are applicable to all data presented with vessel speed at the x axis in section 4 1 in the scatter plot observations are grouped around speeds set by the voyage controller which have a 1 knot resolution there are also some observations in between the requested speeds and below and above the expected band of propulsion efficiency this is due to the dynamic load and transients between requested speeds and the way propulsion efficiency is calculated propulsion efficiency is calculated based on the engine power divided by the power demand in situations where the engine power drops rapidly the inertia of the ship causes a much slower vessel speed reduction this results in an increased propulsion efficiency as the power demand is virtually unchanged in the time it takes for the engine power to drop significantly when comparing the error between a calm water propeller performance as function of speed and the observed efficiencies with the distribution of observations in relation to vessel speed we find that the errors are at its smallest at and above the vessel speeds with the highest number of observations 4 1 3 power production combining the power demand and propulsion efficiency gives the required engine power the engine power scatter data is presented as function of vessel speed in fig 13 with sea passage scenario lclv in fig 13 a hclv in fig 13 b and hchv in fig 13 c the scatter data is augmented with an average and a 90 confidence interval for engine power within seven vessel speeds intervals based on empirical distributions the estimated engine powers for a selection of sea states assuming head waves and propulsion efficiency a function of propeller speed and vessel velocity are included for reference as with the propulsion efficiency and power demand the lowest errors are found at and above the vessel speed with the highest number of observations 4 1 4 fuel consumption as the main performance indicator used in this case study is fuel consumption per sailed distance a fuel consumption plot comparable to those of the factors influencing fuel consumption is presented in fig 14 sea passage scenario lclv is presented in fig 14 a hclv in fig 14 b and hchv in fig 14 c the scatter data is augmented with an average and a 90 confidence interval for fuel consumption within 7 vessel speeds intervals based on empirical distributions estimated fuel consumption for a selection of sea states assuming head waves based on a test bench propeller curve engine efficiency is also included to enable evaluation of the importance of encountered sea states on the fuel consumption the involuntary speed loss scatter data line is also observed in the fuel consumption plots here the line shows an increase with reduced speeds which is expected as the engine power is constant giving the same fuel consumption per time unit while the distance covered is reduced comparing still water fuel consumption with observed fuel consumption in the simulation results highlight a significant discrepancy as with the propulsion efficiency power demand and engine power the lowest errors are found at and above the vessel speeds with the highest number of observations 4 1 5 specific fuel consumption specific fuel consumption g kwh is a common way of evaluating power production efficiency the effect of operational conditions of specific fuel consumption and engine power distribution is compared for the three sea passage scenarios the comparison is plotted in fig 15 where data for the lclv scenario is given in fig 15 a the hclv scenario in fig 15 b and the hchv scenario in fig 15 c the scatter data from the time domain simulation of model 1 is augmented with an average and a 90 confidence interval for specific fuel consumption values within 16 engine power intervals based on empirical distributions engine power distributions of observed engine power are included in a histogram for each sea passage scenario 4 2 comparing model fidelities in this section a comparison of the average and the 90 confidence interval for model 1 td model 1 de and model 2 ea is carried out observations for all sea passage scenarios are combined to generate the underlying data sets fig 16 compares the observed specific fuel consumption as model 2 is based on the engine test bench propeller curve there is no confidence interval in addition to the comparison of specific fuel consumption distributions for the different models a histogram representing the observed engine powers for all sea passage scenarios is also included fig 17 compares propulsion efficiency 17 a power demand 17 b engine power 17 c and fuel consumption per sailed distance 17 d fig 17 a also includes the vessel speed observation distributions for all scenarios combined there are only vessel distributions available for model 1 td and model 2 de model 2 ea vessel speeds are based on the vessel speeds of model 1 de the time series of different performance indicators for the voyage simulations with departure in march are included in fig 18 as an example of how the different models deviate at low load and high load during a voyage an accompanying data set presenting the voyage and sea states encountered is presented in fig 19 where model 2 is based on the voyage of model 1 de 4 2 1 comparing time domain and discrete event voyage simulation time series for model 1 td and model 1 de for all three march sea passage scenarios are presented in fig 19 where data for the voyage controller output and resulting route with encountered operational conditions are presented the voyage control data are vessel speed and course settings data on encountered operational conditions are included in the form hs and positions in the form of latitudes and longitudes in addition there are two plots comparing model 1 td and de by plotting differences in speed and course between the two models the spikes observed in the speed difference plot are due to the speed transients occurring in model 1 td changing vessel speed in the td model by one knot takes about 15 min while it is instant in the de model there are no dynamics in the course changes so spikes observed in the course difference chart are due to differences in temporal resolutions and the exact time of course change it can be observed that the differences in speed policy and route occur towards the end of the voyage and that the two models handle speed loss differently in some instances data for all voyages and all sea passage scenarios in the form of sailed distances and average speed are presented in table 2 4 2 2 operational performance prediction the operational performance in this case study is based on fuel consumption either total fuel consumed during a voyage or the fuel consumption per sailed distance total fuel consumption for the voyages are presented in table 3 model 2 ss is also included although the method is not intended for use on a single voyage this is due to the estimated power demand being based on static statistical approach meaning that it is only appropriate to compare the sum over a year as it is not relevant for single voyages average fuel consumption per sailed distance is presented in table 4 where the total fuel consumption for a voyage is divided by the distance sailed 5 discussion up to this point we have presented model details case specifics and simulation results in this section we discuss the meaning of the results and potential implications of the findings as this case study has been carried out for a large vlcc tanker all observations made may not be applicable to other types of vessel other results may also be expected for other types of vessels such as container ships operating at higher speeds with cargo that are more susceptible to damage and slenderer hulls that behaves differently in waves however the considerations on how operational performance prediction both depends on models used and how the evaluation is carried out are relevant for all ship categories 5 1 the influence of the different factors affecting fuel consumption estimates from the time domain simulation results it is evident that operation in waves has an impact on estimating the fuel consumption however the impact varies for the different factors the effect of operation in waves and transients have some impact on engine specific fuel oil consumption however the difference is very small compared to the still water specific fuel oil consumption power transmission does however have a significant impact on fuel consumption in waves which can be seen in table 3 comparing model 1 de and model 2 ea in waves the power transmission efficiency changes significantly from that of still water operation which affect both the required engine power and at which specific fuel consumption the power is produced although all models use the same estimate for still water resistance and added resistance due to waves it is evident that the method of including waves into the estimation has a significant effect of fuel consumption estimation when comparing the total fuel consumption of model 2 ea and model 2 ss in table 3 5 2 model comparison in comparing the models model 1 td functions as the reference the main difference between model 1 and model 2 is that model 2 requires input on encountered operational conditions and voyage particulars in this case study these data have been provided by model 1 de to ensure that the model comparisons are based on the same voyages however additional differences between the models are expected if other methods for estimating voyages are used for creating the required input to model 2 sandvik et al 2018 in this section mainly model 1 td model 1 de and model 2 ea are compared as model 2 ss only produces data relevant when comparing fuel consumption over a year important reasons for the observed differences between model 1 td and de are the errors introduced in both the curve fitting needed to create the table lookup model and the linear interpolation performed to estimate performance errors in curve fitting are especially evident in the estimation of the specific fuel consumption in fig 16 these errors are limited in the estimation of power demand see fig 11 while they are observable in both estimation of propulsion efficiency see fig 12 engine power see fig 13 and fuel consumption per sailed distance see fig 14 however the differences are not significant in the operation points which have the bulk of observations see the histogram in fig 12 the result is that the overall differences between model 1 td and de are small when comparing total fuel consumption or fuel consumption per sailed distance see tables 3 and 4 another source of difference between model 1 td and de is the effect of accumulating difference in the sailed route due to speed change transients and difference in estimating speed loss in this case study transients when changing speed take about 1000 s which results in a difference in position in addition the de model uses simplified estimates for speed loss while speed loss of the td model is part of the simulation if the difference gets large or the differences in cost estimates for different route alternatives are small this can result model 1 td and de sailing different routes this effect gives a bias when using the td model as the performance estimate of the voyage controller is not equal to what the ship does the effect of this bias would become more pronounced for longer voyages when comparing model 1 and 2 it is most relevant to compare model 1 de and model 2 ea as the ea model uses the same route as the de model the use of still water specific fuel consumption curve with fuel consumption as function of engine power in model 2 ea is based on the data in fig 16 a reasonable assumption time series for the voyages carried out in march seen in fig 18 show that this assumption is reasonable as the specific fuel consumption curve of model 2 ea have less deviation from model 1 td than model 1 de however simplifying the propulsion efficiency to a function of speed only introduces significant differences compared to model 1 de as seen in table 3 this simplification leads to a significant shift in the peak of the observed engine powers seen in fig 15 another area of comparison of the different models is the required modelling and simulation effort model 1 is based on high fidelity models of the engine system propulsion system hull and hydrodynamics such models are time consuming to develop and require significant amount of information that is challenging to obtain especially in an early design phase tillig et al 2018 the simulation effort both for the time domain model and the model reduction is significant compared to the fast calculations required for model 2 currently it is common to use the approach of model 2 in higher level estimations of operational performance applications such as weather routing zaccone et al 2018 voyage optimization lu et al 2015 bottom up emission estimation kilic and tzannatos 2014 in these cases where the goal is just to evaluate an already available system where data is easily available engine models such as the still water specific fuel consumption curve of model 2 are reasonable in this work the focus is however on operational performance evaluation in the context of evaluating novel system design solutions while the goal is to always use as simple models as possible while still capture the effect of design changes it might not be achievable to use simple models such as model 2 for more advanced systems designed to satisfy eedi requirements including pti pto waste heat recovery emission abatement etc a still water specific fuel consumption curve may not adequately describe the system performance at all times other aspects that need to be taken into account is whether the system performance is dependent on the history of the system or if it is by all practical considerations only dependent on a very short history a diesel engine has time constants dictated by the turbo charger and thermal transients however these time constants are very short compared to a voyage and can in most cases be ignored a hybrid system with energy storage based on batteries have longer time constants and is thereby dependent on a longer history which may affect decision making and performance 6 conclusions the case study designed to evaluate four ship system model fidelity levels for operational performance uncovered that model fidelity affected results both due to differences in how different factors had been modelled and how the different models were simulated the main factor affecting performance in operational conditions was found to be the propulsion efficiency estimation dynamic operation of the marine power system was investigated and found to be of less importance when estimating operational performance the difference between model 1 td and de was found to be negligible considering the significant simulation effort required for the td model compared to the de model however model fidelity required does not only depend on the ability to provide useful prediction it also depends on the availability of information that can be used for less simulation intensive models this is illustrated in the case study where all models rely on information from model 1 td for model development through model reduction to either a table lookup model or for the still water specific fuel consumption curve acknowledgements this work was carried out at sfi smart maritime which is mainly supported by the research council of norway through
