23610,it is of critical importance to prevent collisions at sea for navigation safety some popular techniques have been proposed and been used in practice e g closest point of approach collision threat parameters area etc however most of these techniques assume that the target ship keeps a constant velocity which is unrealistic and may easily lead to a false alarm in this article velocity obstacle vo algorithms are applied to support collision avoidance with target ships whose trajectories are non linear with time dependent velocities and probabilistically predictable in particular linear vo non linear vo and probabilistic vo algorithms are used for this purpose compared to traditional approaches these algorithms are capable of detecting collision dangers with target ships sailing non linearly and probabilistically predictably finding collision free velocities in multi ship scenarios and preventing collisions two scenarios are designed to demonstrate the performance of vo algorithms the results show that the proposed vo algorithms can facilitate collision detection and offer proper collision free solutions for ships keywords ship collision avoidance velocity obstacle non linear vo probabilistic vo 1 introduction ship collision is one major threat to navigation safety at sea it usually results in dramatic financial loss and environmental pollution moreover the safety of crews on board is also under threat an active solution to prevent these losses is reducing the probability of collision the research focusing on this theme is known as collision prevention researchers in this field are dedicated to finding methods to detect collision dangers as early as possible and to find proper collision free solutions in practice one of the most widely used methods is based on closest point of approach cpa cpa is an estimated closest position of an approaching ship two indicators are usually used in cpa criterion namely distance to cpa dcpa and time to cpa tcpa dcpa shows the smallest distance between own ship and the approaching ship tcpa provides the remaining time for the approaching ship sailing to cpa when these indicators are smaller than certain thresholds a collision warning is given to support practical evasive actions various factors have been integrated into the cpa criterion by researchers hilgert and baldauf 1997 e g sailing regulation like international regulations for preventing collisions at sea ships dimension movement information etc as a result the cpa criterion is able to raise a collision alarm in compliance with sailing regulations and seamanship to date cpa indicators have been embedded in radar systems on board in support of collision avoidance namely automatic radar plotting aid arpa although the cpa method is widely accepted both in practice and in academia it has some pitfalls firstly the shape of the ship is simplified as a point which might result in overestimation of feasible time for steering that is to say a collision can happen before the ship reaches the cpa szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 secondly the cpa approach does not directly provide evasive suggestions instead the crew has to perform digital evasive actions in arpa and observe the changes of cpa the final evasive actions are determined based on these trails in arpa this process is time consuming in urgent situations it is difficult to find an evasive action in this way thirdly this method frequently leads to false alarms goerlandt et al 2015 the calculation of cpa is based on an assumption that the other ship keeps the observed velocity in the future however the motion of the ship is hard to be invariant especially when the ship is affected by external disturbances or is taking evasive actions in return the estimated cpa is changing over time which may lead to false collision alarms numerous studies have been carried out to overcome these pitfalls in order to consider the shape of ships in collision detection and avoidance ship domain pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 collision diameter fujii and shiobara 1971 pedersen 1995 and minimum distance to collision montewka et al 2010 have been introduced as alternatives for detailed information readers can refer to szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017b zhang et al 2012 and krata and montewka 2015 for the convenience of searching evasive actions collision threat parameters area ctpa is introduced ctpa collects a set of velocities that leads one ship or own ship to collide with other ships or target ship degre and lefevre 1981 lenart 1983 this set is known as ctpa when the velocity of the own ship is belonging to a ctpa set a collision alarm is raised additionally all the velocities outside of this set are collision free solutions pedersen et al 2003 showed that this approach facilitates more homogeneous precise and safe evasive maneuvers moreover combining with navigation regulations szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2015 and ship domains szlapczynski 2008 this method shows a great potential in the field of maritime research szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017a however like the most of existing prevention methods the ctpa method assumes that the target ship travels in a straight line at a constant speed lenart 1983 this assumption is idealized tam et al 2009 and easily lead to false alarms in practice in this article a family of velocity obstacle vo algorithms is adopted to prevent collision with target ships whose motions might change over time linear vo non linear vo and probabilistic vo algorithms we show that these algorithms are able to identify collision candidates and determine the collision free solutions in the maritime environment it is shown that the ctpa approach is identical to the linear vo algorithm and that vo algorithms can be applied in more generalized scenarios the structure of this article is organized as follows an overview of existing collision prevention techniques was shown above and the principle of vo algorithms is explained in section 2 in section 3 the applications of vo algorithms in maritime environment are introduced followed by case studies in section 4 discussions and conclusions are made in section 5 and section 6 respectively 2 velocity obstacle algorithms vo algorithms have been employed to various vehicles for collision prevention e g wheeled robot wilkie et al 2009 unmanned aerial vehicle jenie et al 2015 unmanned surface vehicle kuwata et al 2014 etc the research shows that the vo algorithms are applicable for solving the n body collision problem van den berg et al 2011 in the maritime research field linear vo algorithms have also been used to solve the ship collision problems huang et al 2016 kuwata et al 2014 van westrenen and ellerbroek 2017 in this section the principle of vo algorithm and its variations are explained via a ship ship encountering scenario see fig 1 a ship i is set as the own ship os under our control and its position and velocity are denoted as p i t and v i ship j is an encountering target ship ts and its position and velocity are denoted as p j t and v j the inputs are p i t p j t and v j which are known the output is a set of v i which leads the os to collide with the ts named as vo set 2 1 the basic principle of vo algorithms since a ship has dimensions we employ a prohibit region around the ts to contain all the positions of the os that trigger a collision this region is denoted as c o n f p o here o is the origin and confp is an abbreviation of conflict position hence the prohibit region around the ts can be formulated as p j c o n f p o the operation is the minkowski addition which means adding p j to each element in c o n f p o the shape and scale of the c o n f p o strongly depend on the shape and the size of the ships if the os and the ts are seen as two circles with radius r i and r j respectively the c o n f p can be formulated as 1 c o n f p o r p p o r i r j r where p is denoted as a position in geographical space therefore the os will collide with the ts at time t f if and only if the position of ship i is contained in p j t f c o n f p o i e 2 p i t f p j t f c o n f p o r expand the p i t f by p i t 0 v i t f t 0 3 p i t 0 v i t f t 0 p j t f c o n f p o r solve this equation we have 4 v i p j t f p i t 0 t f t 0 c o n f p o r t f t 0 a velocity of the os satisfying equation 4 means if the os keeps this velocity for time t f the collision will happen at time t f we can collect a set of velocity satisfying equation 4 and denote it as s v o t f thus a set of velocities leading a collision at any time is a sum of s v o t f where t f t 0 i e 5 v o t f s v o t f t f p j t f p i t 0 t f t 0 c o n f p o r t f t 0 the velocity in this set means if the os keeps this velocity forever a collision is guaranteed to happen in the future t 0 2 1 1 a linear vo algorithm the vo set identified by linear vo algorithm is denoted as l v o set the term linear refers to the assumption of the motion of the ts the ts is assumed to sail in straight line at a constant speed in another word p j t f p j t 0 v j t f t 0 hence the l v o can be rewritten as 6 l v o t f d i j t 0 t f t 0 v j c o n f p o r t f t 0 where d i j t 0 is the relative distance between the os and the ts at time t 0 the first part of equation 6 represents a vo set ignoring ship dimensions in velocity space t f d i j t 0 t f t 0 v j is a straight line such as the black line in fig 1 b a point on this line can be formulated by k d i j t 0 v j where k t f t 0 1 and t f is the collision time the second part of equation 6 introduces ship dimensions the c o n f p o is rescaled by t f t 0 1 and located on the line k d i j t 0 v j combining these two parts we obtain a family of prohibit zones in the velocity space and the envelope of these zones are the lvo set which is shaped as a cone a demonstration is shown in fig 1 c the lvo set has following features 1 the apex of lvo set is determined by v j and the direction of the cone is affected by a relative distance at initial d i j t 0 2 when the os chooses its velocity v i in the lvo set which is approaching the apex of this lvo set or v i v j the collision time will be postponed proof a v i in an lvo set satisfies v i k d i j t 0 v j when v i v j we have k d i j t 0 0 it implies k t f t 0 1 0 thus t f need to be infinitely large that means the collision will happen but in a far future 2 1 2 non linear vo algorithm non linear vo algorithm is first proposed by large et al 2002 and it presumes that the motion of the ts is non linear and deterministic that is the ts is allowed to change velocity during the collision process but these changes are known by the os correspondingly the relevant vo set is noted as nlvo set a demonstration of nlvo is shown in fig 2 we set the os as a reference i e p i t 0 0 0 thus equation 4 is simplified to 7 v i p j t f t f t 0 c o n f p o r t f t 0 thus the whole nlvo set can be formulated as 8 n l v o t f p j t f t f t 0 c o n f p o r t f t 0 in the equation t f p j t f c o n f p o r is the trajectory of the ts in geographical space nlvo is the projection of this trajectory from geographical space into velocity space with respect to the projection function t f t 0 1 2 2 probabilistic vo algorithm the probabilistic vo pvo algorithm assumes the motion of ts is unknown but fully predictable in particular all the possible trajectories of ts are known but the choice of the trajectory is unknown the vo set identified by pvo algorithm is noted as pvo set a demonstration of pvo set is in fig 3 in which ts has three equal possible trajectories given an arbitrary trajectory of the ts say k th trajectory the relevant vo set is identified via equation 8 specifically 9 v o k t f p j k t f t f t 0 c o n f p o r t f t 0 where t f p j k t f is the k th trajectory of the ts thereby the whole pvo set is a collection of all the vo sets with different possible trajectories which is formulated as 10 p v o k 1 n v o k where n is the total number of possible trajectories of the ts the vo algorithms in section 2 1 hold a proposition as long as the v i v o k all the time the collision will happen in the future say p c o l l i s i o n v i v o k 1 on the contrary the pvo set identifies all the velocities leading to a possible collision the velocities in pvo set do not guarantee the collisions due to the uncertainties of the trajectory of the ts however it guarantees that the velocities outside of the pvo set are collision free velocities i e p c o l l i s i o n v i p v o 0 denote the probability of the ts choosing the kth trajectory as p v o k 11 k 1 n p v o k 1 the probability of a velocity in pvo set leading collision is p c o l l i s i o n v i p v o 12 p c o l l i s i o n v i p v o p c o l l i s i o n v i p v o p v i p v o c o l l i s i o n p v i p v o c o l l i s i o n where p v i p v o c o l l i s i o n 0 and p v i p v o c o l l i s i o n 1 therefore 13 p c o l l v i p v o p c o l l v i p v o k 1 n p c o l l v i v o k p v i v o k v o k p v o k where p v i v o k v o k 1 if v i v o k 0 otherwise moreover when the ts chooses the k th trajectory and v i v o k a collision is guaranteed say p c o l l i s i o n v i v o k v o k 1 with equation 13 the probability of v i leading to collision is calculated 2 3 remarks of vo algorithms t f t 0 1 is a common factor in equations 4 9 this factor can be deemed as a linear transition function noted t x t f t 0 1 x remark 1 a set of velocities leading to collisions at t f i e s v o t f is a projection of the prohibit region at t f from the geographical space into the velocity space by function t x t f t 0 1 x additionally a set of velocity leading collision in time range t 0 t f i e t t f s v o t is a projection of obstacle s trajectory and the related prohibit regions from geographical space into the velocity space via t x by introducing t x equation 4 can be rewritten as 14 v i s v o t f t p j t f p i t 0 c o n f p o r x x is the prohibit region around ts at t f in geographical space projecting this prohibit region from geographical space into velocity via a function t x a set of velocities leading to collisions at t f is obtained when the collision time t f is infinitely large t f t 0 1 goes to 0 and t c o n f p o r goes to 0 this means the prohibit region is shrunk to a point otherwise the prohibit zone is enlarged illustrations are shown in figs 1 3 correspondingly the vo set is 15 v o t f t p j t f p i t 0 c o n f p o r thus a vo set is a projection of a series prohibit regions from the geographical space to the velocity space moreover the central line of the vo set is the projection of the ts s trajectory from the geographical space to the velocity space in fig 4 we choose an arbitrary point c v c t c on the central line of vo set according to remark 1 v c t c t p j t c p i t 0 point b is the chosen velocity of the os i e v i if v i v c t c the collision is guaranteed at time t c if v i v c t c the distance between os and ts at time t c is v c t c v i t c t 0 set an auxiliary vector b c δ v v c t c v i we claim proposition 1 proposition 1 the vector δ v t c multiplied with time t c is the relative distance between ships at time t c i e d i j t c δ v t c t c t 0 proof o c v c t c p

ship collision prevention in this section the vo algorithms are compared with ctpa and cpa approaches additionally the details of using vo algorithms for ship collision prevention are introduced 3 1 the advantages of vo algorithms 3 1 1 comparison with ctpa ctpa and vo algorithms are both used to identify the velocity of the os leading to a collision with tss however they have different assumptions about the motion of ts ctpa presumes the ts to sail linearly while vo algorithms accept the non linear motion ctpa is developed from the cpa approach thus these methods share the same assumption about ts s motion in particular ctpa method identifies a set of velocities which will result in the dcpa smaller than a certain threshold lenart 1983 i e d c p a d t h r e s the ctpa is shaped as a cone in velocity space and its apex is numerically equal to the velocity of the ts vo algorithms on the other hand are not in replying to cpa and they can be used in more generalized scenarios in fact the ctpa algorithm is one of the special cases in which the motion of the ts is assumed to be linear i e lvo algorithm a velocity in lvo set which satisfies equation 2 leads the os to violate the prohibit region of a ts at a specific time in the future it implies that the relative distance between the os and the ts will be smaller than the threshold t t 0 satisfies d i j t d t h r e s in another word the smallest relative distance between ships also noted as dcpa is smaller than the threshold therefore the lvo set and ctpa are equivalent i e the velocity belongs to lvo set also belongs to ctpa vice versa proof v l v o d i j t d t h r e s min d i j t d t h r e s d c p a min d i j t d t h r e s v c t p a both the lvo algorithm and the ctpa method assume that the ts is sailing linearly without changes of heading and speed however this assumption hinders their applications for more general cases nlvo algorithm and pvo algorithm are able to handle this problem 3 1 2 comparison with cpa approach dcpa and tcpa are conventionally employed as criteria to detect collisions a ts whose dcpa and tcpa are smaller than thresholds will trigger a collision alarm although this method has been widely used it has three defects firstly the cpa approach easily falls into two types of failures goerlandt et al 2015 causing a nuisance alarm during normal navigation and not raising alarm until the collision is unavoidable the main reason is that the calculation of cpa is based on the observed velocities of the tss at each time slice if a ts keeps its velocity the position of cpa is stationary and the value of indicators like dcpa and tcpa is steady in this case the cpa criterion is accurate and consistent however if the motion of the ts is non linearly the cpa is always changing and the value of indicators is unsteady as a result the criterion will be unstable and inconsistent in section 4 1 we present an example in which the cpa approach causes a false alarm secondly to find collision free actions by cpa approach is inconvenient mariners have to try several virtual maneuvers before they can find a collision free action if the os encounters with multiple tss the action to avoid collision with one ts might lead to new collision risks with others any changes of the os s motion will lead to changes in all the tss dcpa and tcpa which increases the difficulties to find collision free actions via the cpa based approach last but not the least cpa approach does not consider the shapes of the obstacles the tss and the os are seen as points the cpa is calculated as the closest point that the corresponding ts can reach however a collision can happen before the ts reaches the cpa due to the dimensions of ships additionally when navigating ships encounter not only these small and regular obstacles but also some huge and irregular obstacles e g islands and coastal line since it is impractical to regard these obstacles as points cpa becomes ineffective vo algorithms can fill these gaps firstly various types of vo algorithms are developed to consider all kinds of motion assumptions on ts e g linear non linear probabilistic secondly the evasive velocities for the os are visualized all the velocities outside of the vo set are collision free velocities hence the os can avoid collision with multiple tss easily by choosing a velocity outside of all the vo sets moreover vo algorithms can deal with different obstacles the coastal line and the bank can be mapped into the os s velocity space regarding remark 1 fig 5 demonstrates an example to project the coastal line into the velocity space the left panel shows the layout of an intersection at sea three channels are connected and one buoy is placed the buoy is located at 0 5 1 with radius 0 25 nm the right panel is the velocity space from the os s perspective the blue region is the vo set for the banks and the red region comes from the prohibit zone of the buoy collision warning time is set as 10 min in this case thus the os s velocity in the blue or red region means collision will happen in 10 min any of the velocities outside of the vo sets can keep the os safe in following 10 min 3 2 the evasive actions according to vo sets 3 2 1 collision warning time theoretically all the velocities outside of the vo set are the collision free solutions to the os in practice if a ts will collide with os in the distant future the os has a sufficient time to deal with the collision under this circumstance the ts is not a threat hence the velocity which is in the vo set but postpones the collision beyond certain time threshold can also be seen as a collision free solution for the os this time threshold is called collision warning time noted t given an encounter situation and collision warning time a vo set can be reconstructed as a collection of sub vo set where the collision time smaller than t i e 16 v o t t s v o t the collision warning time can be set by the crew in the os an example is shown in fig 6 where the red region is the vo set with collision warning time t 3 2 2 vo sets and collision free velocity as shown in fig 6 a vo set divides the velocity space into several sections namely s 1 s 2 s 3 and s 4 different velocities in different sections lead to different outcomes such as passing safely postponing the collisions and immediate collisions the os s velocities in s 1 and s 4 segment will lead to collisions in the future but the time of collision is different the velocities in s 1 segment will result in collisions before time t while the velocities in s 4 segment lead to collisions after time t if the collision beyond time t is not a threat to os the velocities in s 4 can be temporary collision free solutions the velocities in s 2 and s 3 are all permanent collision free velocities for the os the velocities in these two segments will make the relative distance always larger than the safety distance in particular the velocities in s 2 leads the ts to pass the os by its stem and the velocities in s 3 leads the ts to pass the os by its stern the details of proof are shown in appendix a in summary the velocities in s 1 lead to collisions within time t and the velocities in s 4 lead the collisions to postpone by t the velocities in s 2 and s 3 are collision free velocities for the os 3 2 3 vo set for collision avoidance to complete a collision prevention the time for the os returning to its initial route is the last piece of the puzzle to achieve that we introduce a desired velocity which is a velocity that the os wants to keep the desired velocity can be set in many ways in this paper we set a desired velocity orienting to the destination its speed is equal to the os s initial speed v i and it is formulated as 17 v d e s i r e d d d v i where d is the relative distance from the position of the os to the destination therefore the process of collision prevention can be described as a danger detection check whether the existing velocity also equals to the desired velocity is in the vo set or not if not keep existing velocity otherwise goes to next steps b evasive action leave the desired velocity and choose a velocity outside of vo sets c return action keep the chosen velocity until the desired velocity is outside of vo sets choose the desired velocity as os s velocity and repeat step a theoretically an arbitrary velocity outside of vo sets is a collision free solution however in practice we need to find a specific one velocity from numerous collision free solutions in this paper our solution is offering sufficient information to mariners and let them determine the final actions we propose a combination of vo algorithms and cpa indicators which is helpful in this situation it is also a familiar way for mariners on board the calculation of cpa however needs to adapt to non linear motion case to distinguish from the traditional cpa we denote cpa as the closest point of approach when a ts is sailing non linearly the calculation of cpa is based on the nlvo set in appendix b we show that the calculation of cpa can be based on lvo set when the ts moves non linearly nlvo is employed to calculate cpa according to proposition 1 the relative distance over time is formulated as δ v t t when the relative distance goes to a minimum i e min t δ v t t we get the dcpa or dcpa here t is the time to cpa or tcpa t c p a arg min t δ v t t correspondingly cpa δ v t c p a t c p a with dcpa and tcpa mariners can know the effect of different collision free velocities the velocity has a bigger dcpa means it can lead to a larger relative distance with the ts in the future the velocity makes tcpa small means the encountering process will speed up and os will pass ts soon in this way mariners can know about the effect of the chosen velocity compare the different velocity options and make proper decisions 4 case study in this section two scenarios are designed to explain the use of the vo algorithms in maritime navigation scenario i contains three ships one os and two tss whose velocities are not constant in scenario ii stationary obstacles are introduced and the uncertainty of the ts s trajectories are considered the simulation results are also compared with the results using cpa and ctpa approaches 4 1 scenario i encountering with multiple ships 4 1 1 settings the origin destination and basic parameters of the ships are shown in table 1 ts1 sails from the west to the east and keeps its course to 090 but accelerates from 10 knots to 12 knots ts2 sails from the east to the north with a speed of 9 knots and turns to the north around 0 5 2 5 the dashed line in fig 7 1 is the planned trajectories of the tss the velocities of the tss over time are shown in fig 7 2 the length of the os and the tss are 150 m thus the prohibit zone produced by ts1 and ts2 are the same which is a circular area with radius 0 16 nm in the simulation the collision warning time is set to be 30 min i e an obstacle which might collide with the os beyond 30 min is not a threat to the os 4 1 2 results and discussion fig 8 shows the vo sets from the os s perspective a point in this figure represents an alternative velocity for the os in fig 8 1 two nlvo sets are identified the red one is a set of velocities leading the os to collide with ts1 in 30 min the blue one is a set of velocities resulting in a collision with ts2 since the os s velocity is in ts2 s nlvo set and outside of ts1 s nlvo set os will pass ts1 safely but collide with ts2 specifically ts1 will pass the os from the os s stem safely while the os will collide with ts2 at the os s starboard side however when we apply ctpa technique or cpa approach we get opposite results in fig 8 2 and 3 the ctpa identical to lvo sets caused by ts1 and ts2 are shown respectively the os s velocity falls in the ts1 s ctpa set in the light red region in fig 8 2 but outside of ts2 s ctpa set the light blue region in fig 8 3 it indicates that the os will collide with ts1 and pass ts2 safely similarly if we calculate the dcpa and tcpa for ts1 and ts2 at time 0 we reach the same result the initial dcpa of ts1 is below the threshold 0 16 nm while the initial dcpa of ts2 exceeds the safety distance see fig 9 fig 10 shows the relative distance between the os and the tss if the os does not change its speed the minimal distance between the os and ts1 is larger than the safety distance while the minimal distance between the os and ts2 is below the safety distance at time 15 min that is to say if the os keeps current velocity the os will pass ts1 safely but collide with ts2 obviously the argument made by ctpa and cpa at the beginning is wrong in fact the ctpa and cpa approaches can identify collision dangers at the end but the detected time is much later than the nlvo algorithm fig 9 presents the tss dcpa and tcpa changes over time from the figure the ts1 is seen as a threat at the beginning but this mistake is corrected when its dcpa exceeds the safety threshold around 4 min on the other hand the real threat ts2 is seen to be safe at the beginning and is confirmed to be a danger at 15 min 4 min before the collision in other words in this scenario the cpa approach cannot reject the false alarm until 4 5 min before ts1 passes the cpa and the real thread ts2 cannot be detected until 4 min before the collision 4 1 3 supporting collision avoidance the vo algorithms can not only detect the dangers earlier than cpa approach but also provide possible collision free solutions to the os in this scenario if we follow the process in section 3 2 3 the actions to avoid the collision with ts1 and ts2 can be determined the desired velocity heading to the destination can be calculated by equation 17 the steps include 1 danger detection at the beginning since the desired velocity and existing velocity fall in nlvo sets os will have a collision with ts in the 30 min and it needs to seek a collision free velocity 2 choosing an evasive action velocities outside the vo sets are the solutions two alternative velocities are chosen as examples namely port side solution and starboard side solution as shown in fig 11 1 both velocities are the collision free solutions for os they have the same speed of 12 knots the port side one needs a port side turn to 355 while the starboard side solution needs head to 015 we choose the solution with less effort i e the port side one 3 choosing a return action when we keep the port side turn until 6 4 min the desired velocity is outside of the nlvo sets as shown in fig 11 2 that means the desired velocity will keep the relative distance larger than the set threshold 0 16 nm thus the os turns back to its desired velocity until it reaches the destination fig 12 shows the relative distance between os and tss over time when the proposed evasive actions are applied the minimum relative distance is larger than 0 16 nm therefore the os can pass the tss safely and the proposed velocity is a valid collision free option 4 2 scenario ii encountering with target ship in channel intersection in this section we discuss a scenario in which stationary obstacles and the uncertainty of the ts s trajectories are introduced 4 2 1 settings the layout of the encounter scenario in channels is shown in the left panel of fig 13 where two ships are involved and three channels are connected by an intersection one buoy is set at this intersection the width of the channels is 2 nm and the prohibit zone of the buoy is a circle with radius 0 25 nm the settings of the os and the ts is shown in table 2 besides collision warning time is set as 30 min for a moving obstacle and 10 min for a stationary obstacle i e bank and buoy the trajectory of ts is assumed to be unknown at the beginning however the crew on the os can predict several possible trajectories in this simulation four possible trajectories of the ts are employed these trajectories are shown in different color in fig 13 at the beginning of the simulation each trajectory has an equal probability to be chosen as the real trajectory with updating observations such as position and velocity of the ts the probabilities will be updated in this case the pvo algorithm can support collision avoidance as well given the os s velocity falling in a pvo set the os might have two strategies 1 choosing a velocity outside of all pvo sets which guarantees no collision with the ts i e p c o l l i s i o n v i p v o 0 or 2 taking the risk and maintaining current velocity until the predictions are relatively accurate to help mariners make a trade off between these strategies a probability threshold is needed if the probability of collision is less than or equal to this threshold the ts would not be seen as a thread temporarily e g the threshold can be set as 50 that means the os can keep existing velocity until p c o l l i s i o n v i p v o exceeds 50 and then it will choose a velocity outside of all the pvo sets 4 2 2 simulation results the right panel in fig 13 shows the pvo set at time 0 min and an enlarged drawing of pvo set is shown in fig 14 the colorful sets in these figures represent the velocity might lead to a collision with tss in 30 min and the gray regions are composed of velocities causing a collision with stationary obstacles in 10 min the pvo set in fig 14 is roughly divided into three parts zone 1 zone 2 and zone 3 a velocity in zone 1 will result in a collision in 30 min no matter how the ts choose a trajectory a velocity in zone 2 will lead to a collision if the ts sails to the south a velocity in zone 3 might trigger a collision with the eastbound ts at this moment t 0 min the current velocity of the os is labeled as and falls in zone 3 additionally this velocity is at the intersection of green and yellow nlvo sets this implies that if the os keeps this velocity the collision with the eastbound ts will occur in 30 min since each trajectory has an equal chance at this stage the p c o l l i s i o n v i p v o 50 thus the os can keep its existing velocity at t 20 min fig 15 the ts is turning to the east which implies the probability of the ts sails to south drops to 0 and the probabilities of the eastern route are increased to 100 correspondingly the probability of collision p c o l l i s i o n v i v o p a t h 1 reaches 100 and an evasive action is needed a velocity outside of the pvo set is an alternative for the os for example course 015 and speed 8 5 knots is one feasible solution which only requires a starboard turn if we choose this velocity at this stage the change of the pvo set is shown in the left panel of fig 16 the os will keep this velocity until its desired velocity is outside of the pvo set the desired velocity is calculated by equation 17 and labeled as in fig 16 five minutes later around 25 min the desired velocity which is 0 17 8 49 is outside of the pvo set that means the os can choose its desired velocity and the velocity will not lead to any collision moreover the os pass the ts from the ts s stem fig 17 provides the relative distance between os and ts with and without the proposed evasive actions as it shown without any evasive actions a collision occurs and the proposed evasive actions are collision free solutions for the os 5 discussion 5 1 discussion on the result of scenarios in the previous section scenario i shows a situation when the os encounters with multiple ships whose trajectories are non linear but known three techniques have been applied in this scenario namely vo algorithms cpa and ctpa the results of simulation show that the traditional methods cause two problems firstly they could not identify the real threats until 4 5 min before the collision secondly the indicator dcpa rises and falls several times which would confuse mariners see fig 9 on the other hand the vo algorithms can overcome these problems they can detect collision risk earlier and show the potential collision free solutions intuitively to mariners in scenario ii the os encounters with a ship sailing in restricted waters the trajectory of the ship is probabilistically predictable different vo algorithms are then employed in different cases lvo algorithm is used to identify the velocities leading to a collision with banks and buoys pvo algorithm collects all the velocities might result in a collision with tss the result shows that vo algorithms are efficient for collision prevention with a predicable ts in restricted waters in summary vo algorithms can be used to support collision avoidance at sea compared with cpa and ctpa vo algorithms perform better in some aspects firstly if the motion of ts is known or probabilistically predictable the vo algorithms can detect collision dangers earlier and more reliably than the traditional ways secondly the varieties of vo algorithms can handle different encountering scenarios e g trajectory of ts can be linear and non linear the encountering environment could be open sea and restricted waters therefore the vo algorithms have a wide scope of application in collision prevention at sea 5 2 potential improvements of vo algorithms for collision prevention at sea applying the vo algorithms for collision prevention in practice still faces several challenges since the maritime environment is more complicated two main challenges and relevant improvements are discussed firstly the ships that the os encounters might be cooperative or non cooperative for the non cooperative ships some of them have probabilistic trajectories they are taken into account in the pvo algorithm some non cooperative ships trajectories are fully uncertain and the pvo set might be not reliable the applied vo algorithms can only eliminate the velocity leading a collision with those cooperative probabilistically predictable tss and let the os focus on preventing collision with tss have fully uncertain trajectories to solve this problem integrating prediction techniques with the pvo algorithm is necessary for instance in the literature fulgenzi et al 2007 the bayesian filter is integrated into pvo algorithm to support collision avoidance with the cars with uncertain trajectories this combination would be considered in the future work secondly vo algorithms figure out collision free velocities but these velocities are indifferent specifically the vo algorithms cannot tell the mariner which solution is safer or more fuel efficient a possible solution is combining the vo algorithms with optimization theory the collision prevention problem then can be seen as an optimization problem the cost function could be the number of steers the consumption of oil total travel time etc the vo set can be seen as a constraint to bound the feasible solutions in this way we can consider more practical situations for instance the ship maneuverability and collision regulations can be considered as additional constraints by minimizing the cost function subject to constraints the mariners can find the best solutions which can achieve their objectives while guaranteeing the safety 6 conclusion in this article vo algorithms are introduced to support collision avoidance decision at sea in particular lvo nlvo and pvo algorithms have been applied to several scenarios these algorithms can help the crews onboard to detect collision dangers and find proper evasive solutions specifically the velocities leading the own ship to collide with obstacles are collected in vo sets by these algorithms and all the velocities outside of these sets are the collision free solutions for the own ship existing collision prevention techniques are compared to the vo algorithms in this paper e g cpa and ctpa we have shown that the traditional ctpa method in maritime research is identical to the lvo algorithm the vo algorithms have wider applications compared to the cpa approach the vo algorithms perform better to find collision free velocities in multiple ships scenarios the vo algorithms can detect collision dangers no matter the target ship motion is linear or non linear deterministic or probabilistic no matter the size of the obstacle is large or small regular or irregular two encounter scenarios are simulated to compare the vo algorithms with traditional methods the results show that vo algorithms are suitable to avoid collision with non linear and predictable ts they can help mariners detect collision earlier and easier moreover they can offer collision free solutions for mariners applying the vo algorithms at sea also faces some challenges firstly the applied vo algorithms strongly rely on the prediction of trajectories but the precision of prediction is not always guaranteed for instance some ships are not willing to share their route information secondly the vo algorithms can identify collision free solutions but it cannot determine which one is optimal therefore for further research we recommend combining the vo algorithms with prediction algorithms and optimization theory from the field of operational research acknowledgement this work is

with the english revision in this manuscript appendix a we claim that the os can control in which way the ts passes the os by choosing v i in different sections the velocities in s2 leads to the result that the ts pass the os by the os s stern and the velocities in s3 leads the ts to pass the os by the os s stem the proof is shown as follows according to proposition 1 the relative distance between os and ts at time t is formulated as d i j t δ v t t here δ v t v c t v i v c t is the velocity leading os to collide with ts at time t when the dimensions of the ship are neglected from this equation the direction of d i j t is determined by the direction of δ v t when the velocity is in s 2 in fig app1 with t the direction of δ v t moves from the right to the bottom left that means the relative distance d i j t directs from starboard side to stern side likewise if the velocity falls in s 3 with t δ v t moves from right front to the left that means the ts will pass the os by os s stem fig app1 choosing os s velocity in different sections fig app1 appendix b in linear ts case we can find the tcpa and dcpa directly from the vo set given a ts sails linearly the lvo set can be constructed in fig app1 in the figure the vector o a is numerically equal to the velocity of ts v j point b is an alternative collision free velocity say o b v i then we have b a v i j moreover the dashed line in the figure represents a vo set when the dimension of ships is ignored thus point c on the line has a property p j t c p i t 0 t c t 0 1 and denoted as v c t c the vector b c is noted as δ v t c v c t c v i fig app2 an example of encounter situation and the relevant vo set fig app2 based on this terminology we can search a point c which leads δ v t c v i j let say v c then the vector δ v t c t c is cpa the time t c in this equation is so called tcpa and it can be calculated by t c d i j 0 v c v j the norm of cpa is the dcpa i e dcpa δ v t c t c proposition 2 the tcpa is the time t which makes δ v t satisfy δ v t v i j i e b c b a proof the proposition 2 abbr p 2 is assumed to be false that is p 2 is true p 2 means the tcpa noted t c p a leads δ v t c p a v i j given a scenario e g the positions and velocities of two ships the tcpa can be formulated as t c p a d i j 0 cos d i j 0 v j i v j i thus we have the equation of δ v δ v t c p a d i j 0 t c p a v i j v j i d i j 0 cos d i j 0 v j i d i j 0 v i j multiple the δ v by a vector v i j we have δ v t c v i j v j i d i j 0 cos d i j 0 v j i d i j 0 v i j v i j v j i d i j 0 cos d i j 0 v j i d i j 0 v i j v i j 2 v i j v j i v i j 2 0 so that δ v t c v i j it implies that p 2 is true since p 2 and p 2 cannot be both true the original assumption that p2 is false must be wrong and p2 is true 
23610,it is of critical importance to prevent collisions at sea for navigation safety some popular techniques have been proposed and been used in practice e g closest point of approach collision threat parameters area etc however most of these techniques assume that the target ship keeps a constant velocity which is unrealistic and may easily lead to a false alarm in this article velocity obstacle vo algorithms are applied to support collision avoidance with target ships whose trajectories are non linear with time dependent velocities and probabilistically predictable in particular linear vo non linear vo and probabilistic vo algorithms are used for this purpose compared to traditional approaches these algorithms are capable of detecting collision dangers with target ships sailing non linearly and probabilistically predictably finding collision free velocities in multi ship scenarios and preventing collisions two scenarios are designed to demonstrate the performance of vo algorithms the results show that the proposed vo algorithms can facilitate collision detection and offer proper collision free solutions for ships keywords ship collision avoidance velocity obstacle non linear vo probabilistic vo 1 introduction ship collision is one major threat to navigation safety at sea it usually results in dramatic financial loss and environmental pollution moreover the safety of crews on board is also under threat an active solution to prevent these losses is reducing the probability of collision the research focusing on this theme is known as collision prevention researchers in this field are dedicated to finding methods to detect collision dangers as early as possible and to find proper collision free solutions in practice one of the most widely used methods is based on closest point of approach cpa cpa is an estimated closest position of an approaching ship two indicators are usually used in cpa criterion namely distance to cpa dcpa and time to cpa tcpa dcpa shows the smallest distance between own ship and the approaching ship tcpa provides the remaining time for the approaching ship sailing to cpa when these indicators are smaller than certain thresholds a collision warning is given to support practical evasive actions various factors have been integrated into the cpa criterion by researchers hilgert and baldauf 1997 e g sailing regulation like international regulations for preventing collisions at sea ships dimension movement information etc as a result the cpa criterion is able to raise a collision alarm in compliance with sailing regulations and seamanship to date cpa indicators have been embedded in radar systems on board in support of collision avoidance namely automatic radar plotting aid arpa although the cpa method is widely accepted both in practice and in academia it has some pitfalls firstly the shape of the ship is simplified as a point which might result in overestimation of feasible time for steering that is to say a collision can happen before the ship reaches the cpa szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 secondly the cpa approach does not directly provide evasive suggestions instead the crew has to perform digital evasive actions in arpa and observe the changes of cpa the final evasive actions are determined based on these trails in arpa this process is time consuming in urgent situations it is difficult to find an evasive action in this way thirdly this method frequently leads to false alarms goerlandt et al 2015 the calculation of cpa is based on an assumption that the other ship keeps the observed velocity in the future however the motion of the ship is hard to be invariant especially when the ship is affected by external disturbances or is taking evasive actions in return the estimated cpa is changing over time which may lead to false collision alarms numerous studies have been carried out to overcome these pitfalls in order to consider the shape of ships in collision detection and avoidance ship domain pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 collision diameter fujii and shiobara 1971 pedersen 1995 and minimum distance to collision montewka et al 2010 have been introduced as alternatives for detailed information readers can refer to szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017b zhang et al 2012 and krata and montewka 2015 for the convenience of searching evasive actions collision threat parameters area ctpa is introduced ctpa collects a set of velocities that leads one ship or own ship to collide with other ships or target ship degre and lefevre 1981 lenart 1983 this set is known as ctpa when the velocity of the own ship is belonging to a ctpa set a collision alarm is raised additionally all the velocities outside of this set are collision free solutions pedersen et al 2003 showed that this approach facilitates more homogeneous precise and safe evasive maneuvers moreover combining with navigation regulations szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2015 and ship domains szlapczynski 2008 this method shows a great potential in the field of maritime research szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017a however like the most of existing prevention methods the ctpa method assumes that the target ship travels in a straight line at a constant speed lenart 1983 this assumption is idealized tam et al 2009 and easily lead to false alarms in practice in this article a family of velocity obstacle vo algorithms is adopted to prevent collision with target ships whose motions might change over time linear vo non linear vo and probabilistic vo algorithms we show that these algorithms are able to identify collision candidates and determine the collision free solutions in the maritime environment it is shown that the ctpa approach is identical to the linear vo algorithm and that vo algorithms can be applied in more generalized scenarios the structure of this article is organized as follows an overview of existing collision prevention techniques was shown above and the principle of vo algorithms is explained in section 2 in section 3 the applications of vo algorithms in maritime environment are introduced followed by case studies in section 4 discussions and conclusions are made in section 5 and section 6 respectively 2 velocity obstacle algorithms vo algorithms have been employed to various vehicles for collision prevention e g wheeled robot wilkie et al 2009 unmanned aerial vehicle jenie et al 2015 unmanned surface vehicle kuwata et al 2014 etc the research shows that the vo algorithms are applicable for solving the n body collision problem van den berg et al 2011 in the maritime research field linear vo algorithms have also been used to solve the ship collision problems huang et al 2016 kuwata et al 2014 van westrenen and ellerbroek 2017 in this section the principle of vo algorithm and its variations are explained via a ship ship encountering scenario see fig 1 a ship i is set as the own ship os under our control and its position and velocity are denoted as p i t and v i ship j is an encountering target ship ts and its position and velocity are denoted as p j t and v j the inputs are p i t p j t and v j which are known the output is a set of v i which leads the os to collide with the ts named as vo set 2 1 the basic principle of vo algorithms since a ship has dimensions we employ a prohibit region around the ts to contain all the positions of the os that trigger a collision this region is denoted as c o n f p o here o is the origin and confp is an abbreviation of conflict position hence the prohibit region around the ts can be formulated as p j c o n f p o the operation is the minkowski addition which means adding p j to each element in c o n f p o the shape and scale of the c o n f p o strongly depend on the shape and the size of the ships if the os and the ts are seen as two circles with radius r i and r j respectively the c o n f p can be formulated as 1 c o n f p o r p p o r i r j r where p is denoted as a position in geographical space therefore the os will collide with the ts at time t f if and only if the position of ship i is contained in p j t f c o n f p o i e 2 p i t f p j t f c o n f p o r expand the p i t f by p i t 0 v i t f t 0 3 p i t 0 v i t f t 0 p j t f c o n f p o r solve this equation we have 4 v i p j t f p i t 0 t f t 0 c o n f p o r t f t 0 a velocity of the os satisfying equation 4 means if the os keeps this velocity for time t f the collision will happen at time t f we can collect a set of velocity satisfying equation 4 and denote it as s v o t f thus a set of velocities leading a collision at any time is a sum of s v o t f where t f t 0 i e 5 v o t f s v o t f t f p j t f p i t 0 t f t 0 c o n f p o r t f t 0 the velocity in this set means if the os keeps this velocity forever a collision is guaranteed to happen in the future t 0 2 1 1 a linear vo algorithm the vo set identified by linear vo algorithm is denoted as l v o set the term linear refers to the assumption of the motion of the ts the ts is assumed to sail in straight line at a constant speed in another word p j t f p j t 0 v j t f t 0 hence the l v o can be rewritten as 6 l v o t f d i j t 0 t f t 0 v j c o n f p o r t f t 0 where d i j t 0 is the relative distance between the os and the ts at time t 0 the first part of equation 6 represents a vo set ignoring ship dimensions in velocity space t f d i j t 0 t f t 0 v j is a straight line such as the black line in fig 1 b a point on this line can be formulated by k d i j t 0 v j where k t f t 0 1 and t f is the collision time the second part of equation 6 introduces ship dimensions the c o n f p o is rescaled by t f t 0 1 and located on the line k d i j t 0 v j combining these two parts we obtain a family of prohibit zones in the velocity space and the envelope of these zones are the lvo set which is shaped as a cone a demonstration is shown in fig 1 c the lvo set has following features 1 the apex of lvo set is determined by v j and the direction of the cone is affected by a relative distance at initial d i j t 0 2 when the os chooses its velocity v i in the lvo set which is approaching the apex of this lvo set or v i v j the collision time will be postponed proof a v i in an lvo set satisfies v i k d i j t 0 v j when v i v j we have k d i j t 0 0 it implies k t f t 0 1 0 thus t f need to be infinitely large that means the collision will happen but in a far future 2 1 2 non linear vo algorithm non linear vo algorithm is first proposed by large et al 2002 and it presumes that the motion of the ts is non linear and deterministic that is the ts is allowed to change velocity during the collision process but these changes are known by the os correspondingly the relevant vo set is noted as nlvo set a demonstration of nlvo is shown in fig 2 we set the os as a reference i e p i t 0 0 0 thus equation 4 is simplified to 7 v i p j t f t f t 0 c o n f p o r t f t 0 thus the whole nlvo set can be formulated as 8 n l v o t f p j t f t f t 0 c o n f p o r t f t 0 in the equation t f p j t f c o n f p o r is the trajectory of the ts in geographical space nlvo is the projection of this trajectory from geographical space into velocity space with respect to the projection function t f t 0 1 2 2 probabilistic vo algorithm the probabilistic vo pvo algorithm assumes the motion of ts is unknown but fully predictable in particular all the possible trajectories of ts are known but the choice of the trajectory is unknown the vo set identified by pvo algorithm is noted as pvo set a demonstration of pvo set is in fig 3 in which ts has three equal possible trajectories given an arbitrary trajectory of the ts say k th trajectory the relevant vo set is identified via equation 8 specifically 9 v o k t f p j k t f t f t 0 c o n f p o r t f t 0 where t f p j k t f is the k th trajectory of the ts thereby the whole pvo set is a collection of all the vo sets with different possible trajectories which is formulated as 10 p v o k 1 n v o k where n is the total number of possible trajectories of the ts the vo algorithms in section 2 1 hold a proposition as long as the v i v o k all the time the collision will happen in the future say p c o l l i s i o n v i v o k 1 on the contrary the pvo set identifies all the velocities leading to a possible collision the velocities in pvo set do not guarantee the collisions due to the uncertainties of the trajectory of the ts however it guarantees that the velocities outside of the pvo set are collision free velocities i e p c o l l i s i o n v i p v o 0 denote the probability of the ts choosing the kth trajectory as p v o k 11 k 1 n p v o k 1 the probability of a velocity in pvo set leading collision is p c o l l i s i o n v i p v o 12 p c o l l i s i o n v i p v o p c o l l i s i o n v i p v o p v i p v o c o l l i s i o n p v i p v o c o l l i s i o n where p v i p v o c o l l i s i o n 0 and p v i p v o c o l l i s i o n 1 therefore 13 p c o l l v i p v o p c o l l v i p v o k 1 n p c o l l v i v o k p v i v o k v o k p v o k where p v i v o k v o k 1 if v i v o k 0 otherwise moreover when the ts chooses the k th trajectory and v i v o k a collision is guaranteed say p c o l l i s i o n v i v o k v o k 1 with equation 13 the probability of v i leading to collision is calculated 2 3 remarks of vo algorithms t f t 0 1 is a common factor in equations 4 9 this factor can be deemed as a linear transition function noted t x t f t 0 1 x remark 1 a set of velocities leading to collisions at t f i e s v o t f is a projection of the prohibit region at t f from the geographical space into the velocity space by function t x t f t 0 1 x additionally a set of velocity leading collision in time range t 0 t f i e t t f s v o t is a projection of obstacle s trajectory and the related prohibit regions from geographical space into the velocity space via t x by introducing t x equation 4 can be rewritten as 14 v i s v o t f t p j t f p i t 0 c o n f p o r x x is the prohibit region around ts at t f in geographical space projecting this prohibit region from geographical space into velocity via a function t x a set of velocities leading to collisions at t f is obtained when the collision time t f is infinitely large t f t 0 1 goes to 0 and t c o n f p o r goes to 0 this means the prohibit region is shrunk to a point otherwise the prohibit zone is enlarged illustrations are shown in figs 1 3 correspondingly the vo set is 15 v o t f t p j t f p i t 0 c o n f p o r thus a vo set is a projection of a series prohibit regions from the geographical space to the velocity space moreover the central line of the vo set is the projection of the ts s trajectory from the geographical space to the velocity space in fig 4 we choose an arbitrary point c v c t c on the central line of vo set according to remark 1 v c t c t p j t c p i t 0 point b is the chosen velocity of the os i e v i if v i v c t c the collision is guaranteed at time t c if v i v c t c the distance between os and ts at time t c is v c t c v i t c t 0 set an auxiliary vector b c δ v v c t c v i we claim proposition 1 proposition 1 the vector δ v t c multiplied with time t c is the relative distance between ships at time t c i e d i j t c δ v t c t c t 0 proof o c v c t c p

ship collision prevention in this section the vo algorithms are compared with ctpa and cpa approaches additionally the details of using vo algorithms for ship collision prevention are introduced 3 1 the advantages of vo algorithms 3 1 1 comparison with ctpa ctpa and vo algorithms are both used to identify the velocity of the os leading to a collision with tss however they have different assumptions about the motion of ts ctpa presumes the ts to sail linearly while vo algorithms accept the non linear motion ctpa is developed from the cpa approach thus these methods share the same assumption about ts s motion in particular ctpa method identifies a set of velocities which will result in the dcpa smaller than a certain threshold lenart 1983 i e d c p a d t h r e s the ctpa is shaped as a cone in velocity space and its apex is numerically equal to the velocity of the ts vo algorithms on the other hand are not in replying to cpa and they can be used in more generalized scenarios in fact the ctpa algorithm is one of the special cases in which the motion of the ts is assumed to be linear i e lvo algorithm a velocity in lvo set which satisfies equation 2 leads the os to violate the prohibit region of a ts at a specific time in the future it implies that the relative distance between the os and the ts will be smaller than the threshold t t 0 satisfies d i j t d t h r e s in another word the smallest relative distance between ships also noted as dcpa is smaller than the threshold therefore the lvo set and ctpa are equivalent i e the velocity belongs to lvo set also belongs to ctpa vice versa proof v l v o d i j t d t h r e s min d i j t d t h r e s d c p a min d i j t d t h r e s v c t p a both the lvo algorithm and the ctpa method assume that the ts is sailing linearly without changes of heading and speed however this assumption hinders their applications for more general cases nlvo algorithm and pvo algorithm are able to handle this problem 3 1 2 comparison with cpa approach dcpa and tcpa are conventionally employed as criteria to detect collisions a ts whose dcpa and tcpa are smaller than thresholds will trigger a collision alarm although this method has been widely used it has three defects firstly the cpa approach easily falls into two types of failures goerlandt et al 2015 causing a nuisance alarm during normal navigation and not raising alarm until the collision is unavoidable the main reason is that the calculation of cpa is based on the observed velocities of the tss at each time slice if a ts keeps its velocity the position of cpa is stationary and the value of indicators like dcpa and tcpa is steady in this case the cpa criterion is accurate and consistent however if the motion of the ts is non linearly the cpa is always changing and the value of indicators is unsteady as a result the criterion will be unstable and inconsistent in section 4 1 we present an example in which the cpa approach causes a false alarm secondly to find collision free actions by cpa approach is inconvenient mariners have to try several virtual maneuvers before they can find a collision free action if the os encounters with multiple tss the action to avoid collision with one ts might lead to new collision risks with others any changes of the os s motion will lead to changes in all the tss dcpa and tcpa which increases the difficulties to find collision free actions via the cpa based approach last but not the least cpa approach does not consider the shapes of the obstacles the tss and the os are seen as points the cpa is calculated as the closest point that the corresponding ts can reach however a collision can happen before the ts reaches the cpa due to the dimensions of ships additionally when navigating ships encounter not only these small and regular obstacles but also some huge and irregular obstacles e g islands and coastal line since it is impractical to regard these obstacles as points cpa becomes ineffective vo algorithms can fill these gaps firstly various types of vo algorithms are developed to consider all kinds of motion assumptions on ts e g linear non linear probabilistic secondly the evasive velocities for the os are visualized all the velocities outside of the vo set are collision free velocities hence the os can avoid collision with multiple tss easily by choosing a velocity outside of all the vo sets moreover vo algorithms can deal with different obstacles the coastal line and the bank can be mapped into the os s velocity space regarding remark 1 fig 5 demonstrates an example to project the coastal line into the velocity space the left panel shows the layout of an intersection at sea three channels are connected and one buoy is placed the buoy is located at 0 5 1 with radius 0 25 nm the right panel is the velocity space from the os s perspective the blue region is the vo set for the banks and the red region comes from the prohibit zone of the buoy collision warning time is set as 10 min in this case thus the os s velocity in the blue or red region means collision will happen in 10 min any of the velocities outside of the vo sets can keep the os safe in following 10 min 3 2 the evasive actions according to vo sets 3 2 1 collision warning time theoretically all the velocities outside of the vo set are the collision free solutions to the os in practice if a ts will collide with os in the distant future the os has a sufficient time to deal with the collision under this circumstance the ts is not a threat hence the velocity which is in the vo set but postpones the collision beyond certain time threshold can also be seen as a collision free solution for the os this time threshold is called collision warning time noted t given an encounter situation and collision warning time a vo set can be reconstructed as a collection of sub vo set where the collision time smaller than t i e 16 v o t t s v o t the collision warning time can be set by the crew in the os an example is shown in fig 6 where the red region is the vo set with collision warning time t 3 2 2 vo sets and collision free velocity as shown in fig 6 a vo set divides the velocity space into several sections namely s 1 s 2 s 3 and s 4 different velocities in different sections lead to different outcomes such as passing safely postponing the collisions and immediate collisions the os s velocities in s 1 and s 4 segment will lead to collisions in the future but the time of collision is different the velocities in s 1 segment will result in collisions before time t while the velocities in s 4 segment lead to collisions after time t if the collision beyond time t is not a threat to os the velocities in s 4 can be temporary collision free solutions the velocities in s 2 and s 3 are all permanent collision free velocities for the os the velocities in these two segments will make the relative distance always larger than the safety distance in particular the velocities in s 2 leads the ts to pass the os by its stem and the velocities in s 3 leads the ts to pass the os by its stern the details of proof are shown in appendix a in summary the velocities in s 1 lead to collisions within time t and the velocities in s 4 lead the collisions to postpone by t the velocities in s 2 and s 3 are collision free velocities for the os 3 2 3 vo set for collision avoidance to complete a collision prevention the time for the os returning to its initial route is the last piece of the puzzle to achieve that we introduce a desired velocity which is a velocity that the os wants to keep the desired velocity can be set in many ways in this paper we set a desired velocity orienting to the destination its speed is equal to the os s initial speed v i and it is formulated as 17 v d e s i r e d d d v i where d is the relative distance from the position of the os to the destination therefore the process of collision prevention can be described as a danger detection check whether the existing velocity also equals to the desired velocity is in the vo set or not if not keep existing velocity otherwise goes to next steps b evasive action leave the desired velocity and choose a velocity outside of vo sets c return action keep the chosen velocity until the desired velocity is outside of vo sets choose the desired velocity as os s velocity and repeat step a theoretically an arbitrary velocity outside of vo sets is a collision free solution however in practice we need to find a specific one velocity from numerous collision free solutions in this paper our solution is offering sufficient information to mariners and let them determine the final actions we propose a combination of vo algorithms and cpa indicators which is helpful in this situation it is also a familiar way for mariners on board the calculation of cpa however needs to adapt to non linear motion case to distinguish from the traditional cpa we denote cpa as the closest point of approach when a ts is sailing non linearly the calculation of cpa is based on the nlvo set in appendix b we show that the calculation of cpa can be based on lvo set when the ts moves non linearly nlvo is employed to calculate cpa according to proposition 1 the relative distance over time is formulated as δ v t t when the relative distance goes to a minimum i e min t δ v t t we get the dcpa or dcpa here t is the time to cpa or tcpa t c p a arg min t δ v t t correspondingly cpa δ v t c p a t c p a with dcpa and tcpa mariners can know the effect of different collision free velocities the velocity has a bigger dcpa means it can lead to a larger relative distance with the ts in the future the velocity makes tcpa small means the encountering process will speed up and os will pass ts soon in this way mariners can know about the effect of the chosen velocity compare the different velocity options and make proper decisions 4 case study in this section two scenarios are designed to explain the use of the vo algorithms in maritime navigation scenario i contains three ships one os and two tss whose velocities are not constant in scenario ii stationary obstacles are introduced and the uncertainty of the ts s trajectories are considered the simulation results are also compared with the results using cpa and ctpa approaches 4 1 scenario i encountering with multiple ships 4 1 1 settings the origin destination and basic parameters of the ships are shown in table 1 ts1 sails from the west to the east and keeps its course to 090 but accelerates from 10 knots to 12 knots ts2 sails from the east to the north with a speed of 9 knots and turns to the north around 0 5 2 5 the dashed line in fig 7 1 is the planned trajectories of the tss the velocities of the tss over time are shown in fig 7 2 the length of the os and the tss are 150 m thus the prohibit zone produced by ts1 and ts2 are the same which is a circular area with radius 0 16 nm in the simulation the collision warning time is set to be 30 min i e an obstacle which might collide with the os beyond 30 min is not a threat to the os 4 1 2 results and discussion fig 8 shows the vo sets from the os s perspective a point in this figure represents an alternative velocity for the os in fig 8 1 two nlvo sets are identified the red one is a set of velocities leading the os to collide with ts1 in 30 min the blue one is a set of velocities resulting in a collision with ts2 since the os s velocity is in ts2 s nlvo set and outside of ts1 s nlvo set os will pass ts1 safely but collide with ts2 specifically ts1 will pass the os from the os s stem safely while the os will collide with ts2 at the os s starboard side however when we apply ctpa technique or cpa approach we get opposite results in fig 8 2 and 3 the ctpa identical to lvo sets caused by ts1 and ts2 are shown respectively the os s velocity falls in the ts1 s ctpa set in the light red region in fig 8 2 but outside of ts2 s ctpa set the light blue region in fig 8 3 it indicates that the os will collide with ts1 and pass ts2 safely similarly if we calculate the dcpa and tcpa for ts1 and ts2 at time 0 we reach the same result the initial dcpa of ts1 is below the threshold 0 16 nm while the initial dcpa of ts2 exceeds the safety distance see fig 9 fig 10 shows the relative distance between the os and the tss if the os does not change its speed the minimal distance between the os and ts1 is larger than the safety distance while the minimal distance between the os and ts2 is below the safety distance at time 15 min that is to say if the os keeps current velocity the os will pass ts1 safely but collide with ts2 obviously the argument made by ctpa and cpa at the beginning is wrong in fact the ctpa and cpa approaches can identify collision dangers at the end but the detected time is much later than the nlvo algorithm fig 9 presents the tss dcpa and tcpa changes over time from the figure the ts1 is seen as a threat at the beginning but this mistake is corrected when its dcpa exceeds the safety threshold around 4 min on the other hand the real threat ts2 is seen to be safe at the beginning and is confirmed to be a danger at 15 min 4 min before the collision in other words in this scenario the cpa approach cannot reject the false alarm until 4 5 min before ts1 passes the cpa and the real thread ts2 cannot be detected until 4 min before the collision 4 1 3 supporting collision avoidance the vo algorithms can not only detect the dangers earlier than cpa approach but also provide possible collision free solutions to the os in this scenario if we follow the process in section 3 2 3 the actions to avoid the collision with ts1 and ts2 can be determined the desired velocity heading to the destination can be calculated by equation 17 the steps include 1 danger detection at the beginning since the desired velocity and existing velocity fall in nlvo sets os will have a collision with ts in the 30 min and it needs to seek a collision free velocity 2 choosing an evasive action velocities outside the vo sets are the solutions two alternative velocities are chosen as examples namely port side solution and starboard side solution as shown in fig 11 1 both velocities are the collision free solutions for os they have the same speed of 12 knots the port side one needs a port side turn to 355 while the starboard side solution needs head to 015 we choose the solution with less effort i e the port side one 3 choosing a return action when we keep the port side turn until 6 4 min the desired velocity is outside of the nlvo sets as shown in fig 11 2 that means the desired velocity will keep the relative distance larger than the set threshold 0 16 nm thus the os turns back to its desired velocity until it reaches the destination fig 12 shows the relative distance between os and tss over time when the proposed evasive actions are applied the minimum relative distance is larger than 0 16 nm therefore the os can pass the tss safely and the proposed velocity is a valid collision free option 4 2 scenario ii encountering with target ship in channel intersection in this section we discuss a scenario in which stationary obstacles and the uncertainty of the ts s trajectories are introduced 4 2 1 settings the layout of the encounter scenario in channels is shown in the left panel of fig 13 where two ships are involved and three channels are connected by an intersection one buoy is set at this intersection the width of the channels is 2 nm and the prohibit zone of the buoy is a circle with radius 0 25 nm the settings of the os and the ts is shown in table 2 besides collision warning time is set as 30 min for a moving obstacle and 10 min for a stationary obstacle i e bank and buoy the trajectory of ts is assumed to be unknown at the beginning however the crew on the os can predict several possible trajectories in this simulation four possible trajectories of the ts are employed these trajectories are shown in different color in fig 13 at the beginning of the simulation each trajectory has an equal probability to be chosen as the real trajectory with updating observations such as position and velocity of the ts the probabilities will be updated in this case the pvo algorithm can support collision avoidance as well given the os s velocity falling in a pvo set the os might have two strategies 1 choosing a velocity outside of all pvo sets which guarantees no collision with the ts i e p c o l l i s i o n v i p v o 0 or 2 taking the risk and maintaining current velocity until the predictions are relatively accurate to help mariners make a trade off between these strategies a probability threshold is needed if the probability of collision is less than or equal to this threshold the ts would not be seen as a thread temporarily e g the threshold can be set as 50 that means the os can keep existing velocity until p c o l l i s i o n v i p v o exceeds 50 and then it will choose a velocity outside of all the pvo sets 4 2 2 simulation results the right panel in fig 13 shows the pvo set at time 0 min and an enlarged drawing of pvo set is shown in fig 14 the colorful sets in these figures represent the velocity might lead to a collision with tss in 30 min and the gray regions are composed of velocities causing a collision with stationary obstacles in 10 min the pvo set in fig 14 is roughly divided into three parts zone 1 zone 2 and zone 3 a velocity in zone 1 will result in a collision in 30 min no matter how the ts choose a trajectory a velocity in zone 2 will lead to a collision if the ts sails to the south a velocity in zone 3 might trigger a collision with the eastbound ts at this moment t 0 min the current velocity of the os is labeled as and falls in zone 3 additionally this velocity is at the intersection of green and yellow nlvo sets this implies that if the os keeps this velocity the collision with the eastbound ts will occur in 30 min since each trajectory has an equal chance at this stage the p c o l l i s i o n v i p v o 50 thus the os can keep its existing velocity at t 20 min fig 15 the ts is turning to the east which implies the probability of the ts sails to south drops to 0 and the probabilities of the eastern route are increased to 100 correspondingly the probability of collision p c o l l i s i o n v i v o p a t h 1 reaches 100 and an evasive action is needed a velocity outside of the pvo set is an alternative for the os for example course 015 and speed 8 5 knots is one feasible solution which only requires a starboard turn if we choose this velocity at this stage the change of the pvo set is shown in the left panel of fig 16 the os will keep this velocity until its desired velocity is outside of the pvo set the desired velocity is calculated by equation 17 and labeled as in fig 16 five minutes later around 25 min the desired velocity which is 0 17 8 49 is outside of the pvo set that means the os can choose its desired velocity and the velocity will not lead to any collision moreover the os pass the ts from the ts s stem fig 17 provides the relative distance between os and ts with and without the proposed evasive actions as it shown without any evasive actions a collision occurs and the proposed evasive actions are collision free solutions for the os 5 discussion 5 1 discussion on the result of scenarios in the previous section scenario i shows a situation when the os encounters with multiple ships whose trajectories are non linear but known three techniques have been applied in this scenario namely vo algorithms cpa and ctpa the results of simulation show that the traditional methods cause two problems firstly they could not identify the real threats until 4 5 min before the collision secondly the indicator dcpa rises and falls several times which would confuse mariners see fig 9 on the other hand the vo algorithms can overcome these problems they can detect collision risk earlier and show the potential collision free solutions intuitively to mariners in scenario ii the os encounters with a ship sailing in restricted waters the trajectory of the ship is probabilistically predictable different vo algorithms are then employed in different cases lvo algorithm is used to identify the velocities leading to a collision with banks and buoys pvo algorithm collects all the velocities might result in a collision with tss the result shows that vo algorithms are efficient for collision prevention with a predicable ts in restricted waters in summary vo algorithms can be used to support collision avoidance at sea compared with cpa and ctpa vo algorithms perform better in some aspects firstly if the motion of ts is known or probabilistically predictable the vo algorithms can detect collision dangers earlier and more reliably than the traditional ways secondly the varieties of vo algorithms can handle different encountering scenarios e g trajectory of ts can be linear and non linear the encountering environment could be open sea and restricted waters therefore the vo algorithms have a wide scope of application in collision prevention at sea 5 2 potential improvements of vo algorithms for collision prevention at sea applying the vo algorithms for collision prevention in practice still faces several challenges since the maritime environment is more complicated two main challenges and relevant improvements are discussed firstly the ships that the os encounters might be cooperative or non cooperative for the non cooperative ships some of them have probabilistic trajectories they are taken into account in the pvo algorithm some non cooperative ships trajectories are fully uncertain and the pvo set might be not reliable the applied vo algorithms can only eliminate the velocity leading a collision with those cooperative probabilistically predictable tss and let the os focus on preventing collision with tss have fully uncertain trajectories to solve this problem integrating prediction techniques with the pvo algorithm is necessary for instance in the literature fulgenzi et al 2007 the bayesian filter is integrated into pvo algorithm to support collision avoidance with the cars with uncertain trajectories this combination would be considered in the future work secondly vo algorithms figure out collision free velocities but these velocities are indifferent specifically the vo algorithms cannot tell the mariner which solution is safer or more fuel efficient a possible solution is combining the vo algorithms with optimization theory the collision prevention problem then can be seen as an optimization problem the cost function could be the number of steers the consumption of oil total travel time etc the vo set can be seen as a constraint to bound the feasible solutions in this way we can consider more practical situations for instance the ship maneuverability and collision regulations can be considered as additional constraints by minimizing the cost function subject to constraints the mariners can find the best solutions which can achieve their objectives while guaranteeing the safety 6 conclusion in this article vo algorithms are introduced to support collision avoidance decision at sea in particular lvo nlvo and pvo algorithms have been applied to several scenarios these algorithms can help the crews onboard to detect collision dangers and find proper evasive solutions specifically the velocities leading the own ship to collide with obstacles are collected in vo sets by these algorithms and all the velocities outside of these sets are the collision free solutions for the own ship existing collision prevention techniques are compared to the vo algorithms in this paper e g cpa and ctpa we have shown that the traditional ctpa method in maritime research is identical to the lvo algorithm the vo algorithms have wider applications compared to the cpa approach the vo algorithms perform better to find collision free velocities in multiple ships scenarios the vo algorithms can detect collision dangers no matter the target ship motion is linear or non linear deterministic or probabilistic no matter the size of the obstacle is large or small regular or irregular two encounter scenarios are simulated to compare the vo algorithms with traditional methods the results show that vo algorithms are suitable to avoid collision with non linear and predictable ts they can help mariners detect collision earlier and easier moreover they can offer collision free solutions for mariners applying the vo algorithms at sea also faces some challenges firstly the applied vo algorithms strongly rely on the prediction of trajectories but the precision of prediction is not always guaranteed for instance some ships are not willing to share their route information secondly the vo algorithms can identify collision free solutions but it cannot determine which one is optimal therefore for further research we recommend combining the vo algorithms with prediction algorithms and optimization theory from the field of operational research acknowledgement this work is

with the english revision in this manuscript appendix a we claim that the os can control in which way the ts passes the os by choosing v i in different sections the velocities in s2 leads to the result that the ts pass the os by the os s stern and the velocities in s3 leads the ts to pass the os by the os s stem the proof is shown as follows according to proposition 1 the relative distance between os and ts at time t is formulated as d i j t δ v t t here δ v t v c t v i v c t is the velocity leading os to collide with ts at time t when the dimensions of the ship are neglected from this equation the direction of d i j t is determined by the direction of δ v t when the velocity is in s 2 in fig app1 with t the direction of δ v t moves from the right to the bottom left that means the relative distance d i j t directs from starboard side to stern side likewise if the velocity falls in s 3 with t δ v t moves from right front to the left that means the ts will pass the os by os s stem fig app1 choosing os s velocity in different sections fig app1 appendix b in linear ts case we can find the tcpa and dcpa directly from the vo set given a ts sails linearly the lvo set can be constructed in fig app1 in the figure the vector o a is numerically equal to the velocity of ts v j point b is an alternative collision free velocity say o b v i then we have b a v i j moreover the dashed line in the figure represents a vo set when the dimension of ships is ignored thus point c on the line has a property p j t c p i t 0 t c t 0 1 and denoted as v c t c the vector b c is noted as δ v t c v c t c v i fig app2 an example of encounter situation and the relevant vo set fig app2 based on this terminology we can search a point c which leads δ v t c v i j let say v c then the vector δ v t c t c is cpa the time t c in this equation is so called tcpa and it can be calculated by t c d i j 0 v c v j the norm of cpa is the dcpa i e dcpa δ v t c t c proposition 2 the tcpa is the time t which makes δ v t satisfy δ v t v i j i e b c b a proof the proposition 2 abbr p 2 is assumed to be false that is p 2 is true p 2 means the tcpa noted t c p a leads δ v t c p a v i j given a scenario e g the positions and velocities of two ships the tcpa can be formulated as t c p a d i j 0 cos d i j 0 v j i v j i thus we have the equation of δ v δ v t c p a d i j 0 t c p a v i j v j i d i j 0 cos d i j 0 v j i d i j 0 v i j multiple the δ v by a vector v i j we have δ v t c v i j v j i d i j 0 cos d i j 0 v j i d i j 0 v i j v i j v j i d i j 0 cos d i j 0 v j i d i j 0 v i j v i j 2 v i j v j i v i j 2 0 so that δ v t c v i j it implies that p 2 is true since p 2 and p 2 cannot be both true the original assumption that p2 is false must be wrong and p2 is true

system simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method keywords quantization disturbance observer sliding mode control autonomous underwater vehicles unknown time varying disturbances 1 introduction in recent years we have seen that autonomous underwater vehicles auvs play an important role in many undersea applications especially in the ocean surveying and the oil and gas industry control of auvs has received considerable attention with the rapid development of ocean engineering fossen 2002 li and wang 2013 xiang et al 2017a b trajectory tracking control of auvs is an important control problem in marine engineering and control community however auvs suffer from complex subsea conditions such as model non linearities unknown hydrodynamic coefficients and disturbances xiang et al 2017c therefore from a practical point of view the design of efficient controllers for auvs is an important issue in the marine industry one of the control method for an auv is the sliding mode control smc method as a robust control method the smc has attractive features in dealing with system uncertainties and disturbances yu et al 2005 zhu et al 2011 yang et al 2013 yu and kaynak 2017 xiang et al 2017d a second order smc method is used to stabilize an auv which has modeling errors and unknown environmental disturbances as shown in joe et al 2014 benetazzo et al 2015 use the smc law to guarantee a fault tolerant robust control for the dynamic positioning of an over actuated offshore supply vessel in ma and zeng 2015 a sliding mode controller is used to the distributed formation control of auvs networked by sampled data information in cui et al 2016 the attitude of auvs with input nonlinearities is controlled by using the smc method a dynamic region based smc scheme is designed for an auv to reduce the energy demand in ismail et al 2016 in sun et al 2017 an adaptive integral smc law is designed to track the desired path of a virtual ship all aforementioned control design for vessels did not take into account quantization quantization can be found in various control environments such as a network control environment the quantization should be considered when digital networks are part of the feedback loop compared to the systems without quantization the presence of quantization makes it more difficult to achieve the stability of the system due to the quantization effect on the control systems for more information on quantization control one can refer to liberzon 2003 fu and xie 2015 gao and chen 2008 and the references therein the smc is an effective control method for dealing with the quantization due to the robust property of the control method there have been some existing works on connecting the quantization control and smc corradini and orlando 2008 investigates stabilization problem for linear uncertain control systems with saturating quantized measurements by using a time varying sliding surface the quantization effect on the smc systems is analyzed in yan et al 2016 in liu et al 2017 a smc law is developed to arkovian jump systems with the quantization effect zheng et al 2017 investigates quantized smc problem in the unified delta operator system framework quantization is a potential problem for control of auvs since the state variables are required to be quantized and transmitted to the controller side in practical engineering for example in the off shore oilfields systems the underwater robotics interact with the sensor nodes and control nodes via acoustic communications heidemann et al 2006 moreover the communication problem should be considered in cooperative control of multiple auvs as shown in millán et al 2014 in this paper a new type of quantized smc approach is developed for auvs with quantized state and control input the dynamical uniform quantization scheme is used to the design work to the best for the authors knowledge it is the first time in the literature that the quantization effect is considered in the auv control design a disturbance observer is constructed to estimate unknown disturbances and the bound of quantization error is taken into the switching term of the smc to handle the quantization effect the rest of the paper is organized as follows problem statement is presented in the next section including the nonlinear model of the auv the structure of the control system with quantized state feedback and control input and the control objective in section 3 first a finite time observer and the equivalent smc method are used to control the auv system without quantization second a smc method is developed to control the auv system with quantized state feedback and the dynamical uniform quantizer policy is proposed to adjust the quantization parameter finally the result is extended to control the auv system with both quantized state feedback and control input numerical simulation results are given in section 4 to illustrate the performance of the proposed controller section 5 contains some concluding remarks 2 problem formulation 2 1 kinematic and dynamic model of the auv the general dynamic mode of the auv in the horizontal plane can be described by the motion components in the surge sway and yaw directions with the neglecting of the motions in heave roll and pitch the kinematic and dynamic model of the auv can be described as follows 1 η r ψ υ 2 m υ c υ υ d υ υ τ d t where η x y ψ t is the position vector in the earth fixed frame x is the surge position y is the sway position ψ 0 2 π is the heading of the ship υ u v r t is the velocity vector in the body fixed frame u is the surge velocity v is the sway velocity and r the yaw rate of the ship τ τ 1 τ 2 τ 3 t is the control input consisting of control forces τ 1 in surge and τ 2 in sway and moment τ 3 in yaw d t d 1 t d 2 t d 3 t t is the disturbance vector where d 1 t and d 2 t are the disturbance forces in surge and sway and d 3 t is the disturbance moment in yaw the rotation matrix is given by 3 r ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 note that r 1 and presents the two norm of a vector or a matrix c υ is the coriolis and centripetal forces d υ is the restoring force vector m is the inertia matrix in detail c υ 0 0 m v v 0 0 m u u m v v m u u 0 d υ diag d u d v d r m diag m u m v m r m u m x u m v m y v m r i z n r d u x u x u u u d v y v y v v v d r n r n r r r where m is the auv mass x y n are hydrodynamic derivatives of the system and d is hydrodynamic damping effect assumption 1 the disturbances in the auv system 2 are unknown bounded terms d i t is differentiable and d i t has a known lipshitz constant l i 0 i 1 2 3 2 2 the structure of the auv control system with quantization the structure of the auv control system is shown in fig 1 the auv plant and the controller are connected via networks in the network communication channel the state vectors η υ and the observer output d o b s should be quantized then transmitted to the controller respectively similarly the output of controller τ q should be quantized before transmitting to the plant for convenience we use the signal ˆ to present the quantized value of variables in the following part the control input with quantized state feedback is denoted by signal τ q moreover the variable matrices r υ c υ and d υ in 1 2 with quantized state feedback are denoted as r q c q and d q respectively a quantizer can be considered as a device that converts a real valued signal into piecewise constant one denoting that μ is the quantization parameter here the uniform quantizer is defined as 4 z ˆ μ round z μ where z r n is the vector to be quantized z ˆ r n is the quantized measurement and the function round denotes the nearest integer operation which defines that positive elements with a fractional part of 0 5 round up to the nearest positive integer whereas negative elements with a fractional part of 0 5 round down to the nearest negative integer denoting the quantization error as e z t z ˆ z then we obtain e z t n μ 2 where n is the dimension of z 2 3 control objective in this paper we aim at trajectory tracking control of an auv in the presence of unknown disturbance and quantization effect the variables of both the plant state and the output of controller are quantized the objective is to design a smc scheme such that the states of closed system can be stabilized with the effect of quantization assume that quantizers in the side of the auv plant to controller are dynamical uniform quantizers with discrete adjustment of the quantization parameter the reason to design a dynamic quantizer with discrete adjustment of the quantization parameter is that it can drive the system trajectories onto the sliding surface instead of just to some neighbor of the sliding surface zheng and yang 2014 static uniform quantizers are used in the side of controller to plane the static quantizers are common because of its simplicity in construction 3 sliding mode control with quantization to show the quantization effect on auvs clearly in this section first the equivalent smc method is used to control the system without quantization then quantization is brought to the system and the improved equivalent smc method is proposed to control the auv system with quantization effect 3 1 sliding mode control without quantization 3 1 1 disturbance observer design in this part we construct the finite time disturbance observer for the unknown time varying disturbances d t as follows levant 2003 5 z 0 ε 0 c d υ τ z 1 ε 1 z 2 ε 2 where 6 ε 0 λ 0 l 1 3 z 0 mυ 2 3 sign z 0 mυ z 1 ε 1 λ 1 l 1 2 z 1 ε 0 1 2 sign z 1 ε 0 z 2 ε 2 λ 2 l sign z 2 ε 1 and z j z j 1 z j 2 z j 3 t ε j ε j 1 ε j 2 ε j 3 t j 0 1 2 and λ 0 λ 1 λ 2 0 are observer coefficients to be designed z 0 is the estimate of mυ z 1 is the estimate of d and z 2 is the estimate of d the sign function presented by sign is defined as sign x 1 if x 0 0 if x 0 1 if x 0 the estimation errors are defined as e 0 z 0 mυ e 1 z 1 d and e 2 z 2 d according to 2 and 5 the ith subobserver estimation error is given as 7 e 0 i λ 0 l 1 3 e 0 i 2 3 sign e 0 i e 1 i e 1 i λ 1 l 1 2 e

measured with some lebesgue measurable noise bounded by ξ 0 and ξ 2 3 respectively then levant 2003 8 z 1 i t d i t ξ 2 3 ϖ 0 i 1 2 3 3 1 2 the equivalent sliding mode control in this part we design an equivalent smc law for the auv with the disturbance observer 5 6 the objective is to adjust the control input τ to control the state η following the desired trajectory η d as time goes to infinity the tracking error is defined as e η η d choose the following sliding mode surface 9 s e c e rυ η d c η η d where s s 1 s 2 s 3 t r 3 and c 0 is the parameter of sliding mode the time derivative of 9 is 10 s r υ r υ η d c rυ η d here we use the equivalent smc method utkin 1977 the control law can be chosen as the following form 11 τ τ e q τ s where τ e q c υ d υ υ d o b s t m r 1 r υ η d c rυ η d

estimate of d t using the disturbance observer introduced in section 3 1 1 theorem 1 consider the closed system consisting of the auv 1 2 with unknown time varying disturbances under assumption 1 the finite time observer 5 6 and the smc law 11 the closed system state can be driven onto the sliding surface s t 0 in a finite time the tracking errors converge to zero asymptotically with the control

the lyapunov function v 0 5 s t s and substituting 13 into the time derivative of v yields 14 v s t r υ r υ η d c rυ η d substituting 2 and 13 into 14 we have 15 v i 1 3 α i s i 0 hence according to barbalat s lemma the system states can be driven to the sliding surface s t 0 in a finite time the control objective η η d can be achieved as t remark 1 the observer transient may be made arbitrarily short with a proper choice of observer parameters levant 2003 let the initial conditions of the observer belong to some compact set then for any two embedded discs centered at the origin of the space d d d the parameters of α in controller 11 can be chosen in such a way that all trajectories stating in the smaller disc do not leave the larger disc during the finite time convergence to the origin levant 2003 3 2 sliding mode control with state quantization in this subsection we will design a sliding mode tracking control law for the auv with state quantization suppose that the states of the auv system 1 2 have quantized measurements η ˆ and υ ˆ the quantization errors are denoted by e η η ˆ η and e υ υ ˆ υ by using the uniform quantizer as shown in 4 we have e η 0 5 μ 3 and e υ 0 5 μ 3 the designed sliding manifold with quantized state feedback is denoted by the signal s q according to 9 we obtain 16 s q r q υ ˆ η d c η ˆ η d the following lemma shows the maximal region that sign s sign s q lemma 1 the maximal region ϒ where the sign of s q is different from that of s is the closed region 17 s ω where ω 2 υ ˆ 3 c 3 μ 2 proof denoting e r r q r e ψ ψ ˆ ψ and using the transform cos ψ ˆ cos ψ 2 sin ψ e ψ 2 sin e ψ 2 and sin cos ψ ˆ cos ψ 2 sin ψ e ψ 2 sin e ψ 2 sin ψ 2 cos ψ e ψ 2 sin e ψ 2 we obtain 18 e r e r 0 0 0 where e r 2 sin e ψ 2 sin ψ e ψ 2 cos ψ e ψ 2 cos ψ e ψ 2 sin ψ e ψ 2 then we have e r 2 sin e ψ 2 2 according to 9 and 16 we have 19 e s s q s r ˆ υ ˆ rυ c η ˆ η it follows that e s e r υ ˆ r ˆ e υ e r e υ c e η then we have 20 e s ω from 20 we have 21 s q s ω 22 s q s ω combining 21 and 22 the inequality in 17 is obtained remark 2 from 18 we have e r 0 5 μ when μ 1 it follows that ω in 17 becomes υ ˆ 3 c 3 μ 2 then we obtain that the magnitude of the region ϒ is of the order o μ in the condition μ 1 lemma 2 if the state stays in the region s ω then the quantization parameter μ 0 satisfies the condition 23 μ c η c η d η d υ ˆ 1 0 5 c 3 proof from 9 and r 1 we have s υ ˆ 3 μ 2 c η c η d η d according to lemma 1 we have υ ˆ 3 μ 2 c η c η d η d ω then the inequality 23 can be obtained with the quantized state feedback the formula 2 can be rewritten

equal to d o b s in a finite time the following proof will be divided into two steps in step 1 we prove that from any initial value the trajectory will be driven into the region ϒ i e s ω μ once the trajectory reaches the region ϒ it turns to step 2 in step 2 the adjustment of the quantization parameter μ is presented step 1 recalling lemma 1 we have shown that the sufficient condition of sign s sign s q is that state stays outside region ϒ the formula 27 outside region ϒ turns into 28 s e τ e q r r q 1 2 α sign s from e r 1 2 we have r q 1 2 r 1 and r r q 1 2 1 choosing the lyapunov function

be less than zero to ensure stability therefore an upper estimate of the disturbances is needed rather than the precise information on their values observing e τ e q e τ e q 1 e τ e q 2 e τ e q 3 t in the following we will calculate the bound of quantization error brought by the equivalent control term τ q e q i e the maximal value of e τ e q i i 1 2 3 from 11 and 25 we have e τ e q τ q e q τ e q c

2 i a 3 i i 1 2 3 from 29 and 34 if the conditions in theorem 2 hold we have v 0 which indicates that s enters ϒ monotonically once the state steers outside ϒ the controller always forces the trajectory back into the boundary layer region ϒ thus the state is limited inside ϒ by the action of robust control term τ q s step 2 one of the key step on designing the smc scheme is how to choose an effective adjustment strategy for μ to make sure the stability of the closed system if the condition in 23 is satisfied we know that the state is in region ϒ then we can perform the adjustment of μ by letting μ 1 δ μ where the constant 0 δ 1 is a given parameter according to 17 and remark 2 we have that ω μ is a monotonically increasing function of μ and ω μ 1 ω μ it turns to step 1 it follows that s will be driven into a smaller band region s ω μ 1 with the quantization parameter μ 1 in control action of τ q s repeating the same procedure in steps 1 and 2 the quantization parameter is adjusted to μ i 1 δ i 1 μ once the trajectory enters into the region s ω μ i i 1 2 3 denote ϒ i as the region s ω μ i in the decreasing process of μ and ω once the state stays outside ϒ i the robust control term τ q s always forces the trajectory back into the boundary layer region ϒ i again then we have s 0 as i and μ i 0 with t remark 3 in the condition μ 1 e r 1 1 and a 3 is of the order o μ moreover formula 34 becomes e τ e q i 0 5 μ a 0 i a 1 i a 2 i a 3 i i 1 2 3 we obtain that the magnitude of the quantization error e τ e q brought by the equivalent term τ q e q is of the order o μ if μ 1 3 3 sliding mode control with input and state quantization in this subsection we obtain results analogous to those given in section 3 2 for the auv system whose both state and input are quantized suppose that the smc law with quantized state feedback τ q is not implementable and only the quantized measurement τ ˆ q is available as shown in fig 1 then the quantized control input law becomes 35 τ ˆ q μ τ round τ q μ τ where μ τ is the quantization parameter of the uniform quantizer in the side of control input the formula 2 can be rewritten as 36 m υ c υ υ d υ υ τ ˆ q d t theorem 3 consider the closed system consisting of the auv 1 and 36 with unknown time varying disturbances under assumption 1 uniform quantized state feedback the finite time disturbance observer 5 6 and the quantized control input τ ˆ q 35 with the smc law τ q τ q e q τ q s the control terms τ q e q and τ q s are shown in 25 26 where α i 0 5 μ a 0 i a 1 i a 2 i a 3 i γ 0 5 μ τ 3 μ 1 i 1 2 3 the parameters μ γ and a j i j 0 1 2 3 are defined in theorem 2 μ τ is the quantization parameter in the side of control input the system state will reach the boundary layer s ω and stay in it thereafter then by the adjustment of the quantization parameter μ the trajectory of the closed system can be driven onto the sliding surface s t 0 and the tracking error will finally converge to zero asymptotically proof denoting e τ q τ ˆ q τ q from 35 we have e τ q 0 5 3 μ τ it follows that τ ˆ q τ q e τ q τ q e q τ q s e τ q with the quantized control input τ ˆ q as shown in 35 the time derivative of s becomes 37 s τ e q τ q e q r m 1 e τ q r r q 1 2 α sign s q after d becomes equal to d o b s in a finite time if the conditions in theorem 3 hold s 0 which indicates that s enters ϒ monotonically in the region ϒ the proof is very similar to that of theorem 2 and is omitted here for the sake of brevity 4 simulation studies in this section simulation studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method the hydrodynamic parameters of the auv dynamic model are shown in table 1 pettersen and egeland 1999 xiang et al 2015 the initial states of the auv are given as η 0 1 9 0 5 t and υ 0 1

system simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method keywords quantization disturbance observer sliding mode control autonomous underwater vehicles unknown time varying disturbances 1 introduction in recent years we have seen that autonomous underwater vehicles auvs play an important role in many undersea applications especially in the ocean surveying and the oil and gas industry control of auvs has received considerable attention with the rapid development of ocean engineering fossen 2002 li and wang 2013 xiang et al 2017a b trajectory tracking control of auvs is an important control problem in marine engineering and control community however auvs suffer from complex subsea conditions such as model non linearities unknown hydrodynamic coefficients and disturbances xiang et al 2017c therefore from a practical point of view the design of efficient controllers for auvs is an important issue in the marine industry one of the control method for an auv is the sliding mode control smc method as a robust control method the smc has attractive features in dealing with system uncertainties and disturbances yu et al 2005 zhu et al 2011 yang et al 2013 yu and kaynak 2017 xiang et al 2017d a second order smc method is used to stabilize an auv which has modeling errors and unknown environmental disturbances as shown in joe et al 2014 benetazzo et al 2015 use the smc law to guarantee a fault tolerant robust control for the dynamic positioning of an over actuated offshore supply vessel in ma and zeng 2015 a sliding mode controller is used to the distributed formation control of auvs networked by sampled data information in cui et al 2016 the attitude of auvs with input nonlinearities is controlled by using the smc method a dynamic region based smc scheme is designed for an auv to reduce the energy demand in ismail et al 2016 in sun et al 2017 an adaptive integral smc law is designed to track the desired path of a virtual ship all aforementioned control design for vessels did not take into account quantization quantization can be found in various control environments such as a network control environment the quantization should be considered when digital networks are part of the feedback loop compared to the systems without quantization the presence of quantization makes it more difficult to achieve the stability of the system due to the quantization effect on the control systems for more information on quantization control one can refer to liberzon 2003 fu and xie 2015 gao and chen 2008 and the references therein the smc is an effective control method for dealing with the quantization due to the robust property of the control method there have been some existing works on connecting the quantization control and smc corradini and orlando 2008 investigates stabilization problem for linear uncertain control systems with saturating quantized measurements by using a time varying sliding surface the quantization effect on the smc systems is analyzed in yan et al 2016 in liu et al 2017 a smc law is developed to arkovian jump systems with the quantization effect zheng et al 2017 investigates quantized smc problem in the unified delta operator system framework quantization is a potential problem for control of auvs since the state variables are required to be quantized and transmitted to the controller side in practical engineering for example in the off shore oilfields systems the underwater robotics interact with the sensor nodes and control nodes via acoustic communications heidemann et al 2006 moreover the communication problem should be considered in cooperative control of multiple auvs as shown in millán et al 2014 in this paper a new type of quantized smc approach is developed for auvs with quantized state and control input the dynamical uniform quantization scheme is used to the design work to the best for the authors knowledge it is the first time in the literature that the quantization effect is considered in the auv control design a disturbance observer is constructed to estimate unknown disturbances and the bound of quantization error is taken into the switching term of the smc to handle the quantization effect the rest of the paper is organized as follows problem statement is presented in the next section including the nonlinear model of the auv the structure of the control system with quantized state feedback and control input and the control objective in section 3 first a finite time observer and the equivalent smc method are used to control the auv system without quantization second a smc method is developed to control the auv system with quantized state feedback and the dynamical uniform quantizer policy is proposed to adjust the quantization parameter finally the result is extended to control the auv system with both quantized state feedback and control input numerical simulation results are given in section 4 to illustrate the performance of the proposed controller section 5 contains some concluding remarks 2 problem formulation 2 1 kinematic and dynamic model of the auv the general dynamic mode of the auv in the horizontal plane can be described by the motion components in the surge sway and yaw directions with the neglecting of the motions in heave roll and pitch the kinematic and dynamic model of the auv can be described as follows 1 η r ψ υ 2 m υ c υ υ d υ υ τ d t where η x y ψ t is the position vector in the earth fixed frame x is the surge position y is the sway position ψ 0 2 π is the heading of the ship υ u v r t is the velocity vector in the body fixed frame u is the surge velocity v is the sway velocity and r the yaw rate of the ship τ τ 1 τ 2 τ 3 t is the control input consisting of control forces τ 1 in surge and τ 2 in sway and moment τ 3 in yaw d t d 1 t d 2 t d 3 t t is the disturbance vector where d 1 t and d 2 t are the disturbance forces in surge and sway and d 3 t is the disturbance moment in yaw the rotation matrix is given by 3 r ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 note that r 1 and presents the two norm of a vector or a matrix c υ is the coriolis and centripetal forces d υ is

terms d i t is differentiable and d i t has a known lipshitz constant l i 0 i 1 2 3 2 2 the structure of the auv control system with quantization the structure of the auv control system is shown in fig 1 the auv plant and the controller are connected via networks in the network communication channel the state vectors η υ and the observer output d o b s should be quantized then transmitted to the controller respectively similarly the output of controller τ q should be quantized before transmitting to the plant for convenience we use the signal ˆ to present the quantized value of variables in the following part the control input with quantized state feedback is denoted by signal τ q moreover the variable matrices r υ c υ and d υ in 1 2 with quantized state feedback are denoted as r q c q and d q respectively a quantizer can be considered as a device that converts a real valued signal into piecewise constant one denoting that μ is the quantization parameter here the uniform quantizer is defined as 4 z ˆ μ round z μ where z r n is the vector to be quantized z ˆ r n is the quantized measurement and the function round denotes the nearest integer operation which defines that positive elements with a fractional part of 0 5 round up to the nearest positive integer whereas negative elements with a fractional part of 0 5 round down to the nearest negative integer denoting the quantization error as e z t z ˆ z then we obtain e z t n μ 2 where n is the dimension of z 2 3 control objective in this paper we aim at trajectory tracking control of an auv in the presence of unknown disturbance and quantization effect the variables of both the plant state and the output of controller are quantized the objective is to design a smc scheme such that the states of closed system can be stabilized with the effect of quantization assume that quantizers in the side of the auv plant to controller are dynamical uniform quantizers with discrete adjustment of the quantization parameter the reason to design a dynamic quantizer with discrete adjustment of the quantization parameter is that it can drive the system trajectories onto the sliding surface instead of just to some neighbor of the sliding surface zheng and yang 2014 static uniform quantizers are used in the side of controller to plane the static quantizers are common because of its simplicity in construction 3 sliding mode control with quantization to show the quantization effect on auvs clearly in this section first the equivalent smc method is used to control the system without quantization then quantization is brought to the system and the improved equivalent smc method is proposed to control the auv system with quantization effect 3 1 sliding mode control without quantization 3 1 1 disturbance observer design in this part we construct the finite time disturbance observer for the unknown time varying disturbances d t as follows levant 2003 5 z 0 ε 0 c d υ τ z 1 ε 1 z 2 ε 2 where 6 ε 0 λ 0 l 1 3 z 0 mυ 2 3 sign z 0 mυ z 1 ε 1 λ 1 l 1 2 z 1 ε 0 1 2 sign z 1 ε 0 z 2 ε 2 λ 2 l sign z 2 ε 1 and z j z j 1 z j 2 z j 3 t ε j ε j 1 ε j 2 ε j 3 t j 0 1 2 and λ 0 λ 1 λ 2 0 are observer coefficients to be designed z 0 is the estimate of mυ z 1 is the estimate of d and z 2 is the estimate of d the sign function presented by sign is defined as sign x 1 if x 0 0 if x 0 1 if x 0 the estimation errors are defined as e 0 z 0 mυ e 1 z 1 d and e 2 z 2 d according to 2 and 5 the ith subobserver estimation error is given as 7 e 0 i λ 0 l 1 3 e 0 i 2 3 sign e 0 i e 1 i e 1 i λ 1 l 1 2 e

measured with some lebesgue measurable noise bounded by ξ 0 and ξ 2 3 respectively then levant 2003 8 z 1 i t d i t ξ 2 3 ϖ 0 i 1 2 3 3 1 2 the equivalent sliding mode control in this part we design an equivalent smc law for the auv with the disturbance observer 5 6 the objective is to adjust the control input τ to control the state η following the desired trajectory η d as time goes to infinity the tracking error is defined as e η η d choose the following sliding mode surface 9 s e c e rυ η d c η η d where s s 1 s 2 s 3 t r 3 and c 0 is the parameter of sliding mode the time derivative of 9 is 10 s r υ r υ η d c rυ η d here we use the equivalent smc method utkin 1977 the control law can be chosen as the following form 11 τ τ e q τ s where τ e q c υ d υ υ d o b s t m r 1 r υ η d c rυ η d is the equivalent control term τ s m r 1 α sign s is the robust control term with the constant matrix α diag α 1 α 2 α 3 α i 0 i 1 2 3 and sign s sign s 1 sign s 2 sign s 3 t d o b s t r 3 is the estimate of d t using the disturbance observer introduced in section 3 1 1 theorem 1 consider the closed system consisting of the auv 1 2 with unknown time varying disturbances under assumption 1 the finite time observer 5 6 and the smc law 11 the closed system state can be driven onto the sliding surface s t 0 in a finite time the tracking errors converge to zero asymptotically with the control law 11 proof substituting 11 into 10 we have 12 s r m 1 d d o b s α sign s which is reduced to the system 13 s α sign s after d becomes equal to d o b s in a finite time shtessel et al 2009 defining the lyapunov function v 0 5 s t s and substituting 13 into the time derivative of v yields 14 v s t r υ r υ η d c rυ η d substituting 2 and 13 into 14 we have 15 v i 1 3 α i s i 0 hence according to barbalat s lemma the system states can be driven to the sliding surface s t 0 in a finite time the control objective η η d can be achieved as t remark 1 the observer transient may be made arbitrarily short with a proper choice of observer parameters levant 2003 let the initial conditions of the observer belong to some compact set then for any two embedded discs centered at the origin of the space d d d the parameters of α in controller 11 can be chosen in such a way that all trajectories stating in the smaller disc do not leave the larger disc during the finite time convergence to the origin levant 2003 3 2 sliding mode control with state quantization in this subsection we will design a sliding mode tracking control law for the auv with state quantization suppose that the states of the auv system 1 2 have quantized measurements η ˆ and υ ˆ the quantization errors are denoted by e η η ˆ η and e υ υ ˆ υ by using the uniform quantizer as shown in 4 we have e η 0 5 μ 3 and e υ 0 5 μ 3 the designed sliding manifold with quantized state feedback is denoted by the signal s q according to 9 we obtain 16 s q r q υ ˆ η d c η ˆ η d the following lemma shows the maximal region that sign s sign s q lemma 1 the maximal region ϒ where the sign of s q is different from that of s is the closed region 17 s ω where ω 2 υ ˆ 3 c 3 μ 2 proof denoting e r r q r e ψ ψ ˆ ψ and using the transform cos ψ ˆ cos ψ 2 sin ψ e ψ 2 sin e ψ 2 and sin cos ψ ˆ cos ψ 2 sin ψ e ψ 2 sin e ψ 2 sin ψ 2 cos ψ e ψ 2 sin e ψ 2 we obtain 18 e r e r 0 0 0 where e r 2 sin e ψ 2 sin ψ e ψ 2 cos ψ e ψ 2 cos ψ e ψ 2 sin ψ e ψ 2 then we have e r 2 sin e ψ 2 2 according to 9 and 16 we have 19 e s s q s r ˆ υ ˆ rυ c η ˆ η it follows that e s e r υ ˆ r ˆ e υ e r e υ c e η then we have 20 e s ω from 20 we have 21 s q s ω 22 s q s ω combining 21 and 22 the inequality in 17 is obtained remark 2 from 18 we have e r 0 5 μ when μ 1 it follows that ω in 17 becomes υ ˆ 3 c 3 μ 2 then we obtain that the magnitude of the region ϒ is of the order o μ in the condition μ 1 lemma 2 if the state stays in the region s ω then the quantization parameter μ 0 satisfies the condition 23 μ c η c η d η d υ ˆ 1 0 5 c 3 proof from 9 and r 1 we have s υ ˆ 3 μ 2 c η c η d η d according to lemma 1 we have υ ˆ 3 μ 2 c η c η d η d ω then the inequality 23 can be obtained with the quantized state feedback the formula 2 can be rewritten as 24 m υ c υ υ d υ υ τ q d t furthermore the equivalent control term τ q e q becomes 25 τ q e q c q d q υ ˆ d ˆ o b s m r q 1 r q c r q υ ˆ m r q 1 η d c η d note that the observer is located between the plant and the quantizer as shown in fig 1 the signal d ˆ o b s in 25 denotes the quantized value of d o b s which is obtained by the finite time observer as shown in section 3 1 1 observe that the structure of τ q e q is similar with that of τ e q as shown in 11 this time the variables included in 25 are the quantized values of states comparing 25 with 11 we can obtain that the quantization

layer s ω and stay in it thereafter then by the adjustment of the quantization parameter μ the trajectory of the closed system can be driven onto the sliding surface s t 0 and the tracking error will finally converge to zero asymptotically proof substituting τ q into 10 we have s e τ e q m r q 1 2 α sign s q r m 1 d d o b s which is reduced to 27 s e τ e q m r q 1 2 α sign s q after d becomes equal to d o b s in a finite time the following proof will be divided into two steps in step 1 we prove that from any initial value the trajectory will be driven into the region ϒ i e s ω μ once the trajectory reaches the region ϒ it turns to step 2 in step 2 the adjustment of the quantization parameter μ is presented step 1 recalling lemma 1 we have shown that the sufficient condition of sign s

be less than zero to ensure stability therefore an upper estimate of the disturbances is needed rather than the precise information on their values observing e τ e q e τ e q 1 e τ e q 2 e τ e q 3 t in the following we will calculate the bound of quantization error brought by the equivalent control term τ q e q i e the maximal value of e τ e q i i 1 2 3 from 11 and 25 we have e τ e q τ q e q τ e q c

where m u v m u m v it follows that 31 c q υ ˆ cυ 0 5 μ a 1 observe that the rotation matrix r has the properties r t r i and r rβ r where β r 0 r 0 r 0 0 0 0 0 it follows that m r 1 r c r υ m β r c υ then we have m r q 1 r q c r q υ ˆ m r 1 r c r υ m r ˆ e v υ ˆ e r e v e r u ˆ e r r ˆ e u e u e r m c e υ it follows that 32 m r q 1 r q c r q υ ˆ m r 1 r c r υ d ˆ o b s d o b s 0 5 μ a 2 from r 1 r

2 i a 3 i i 1 2 3 from 29 and 34 if the conditions in theorem 2 hold we have v 0 which indicates that s enters ϒ monotonically once the state steers outside ϒ the controller always forces the trajectory back into the boundary layer region ϒ thus the state is limited inside ϒ by the action of robust control term τ q s step 2 one of the key step on designing the smc scheme is how to choose an effective adjustment strategy for μ to make sure the stability of the closed system if the condition in 23 is satisfied we know that the state is in region ϒ then we can perform the adjustment of μ by letting μ 1 δ μ where the constant 0 δ 1 is a given parameter according to 17 and remark 2 we have that ω μ is a monotonically increasing function of μ and ω μ 1 ω μ it turns to step 1 it follows that s will be driven into a smaller band region s ω μ 1 with the quantization parameter μ 1 in control action of τ q s repeating the same procedure in steps 1 and 2 the quantization parameter is adjusted to μ i 1 δ i 1 μ once the trajectory enters into the region s ω μ i i 1 2 3 denote ϒ i as the region s ω μ i in the decreasing process of μ and ω once the state stays outside ϒ i the robust control term τ q s always forces the trajectory back into the boundary layer region ϒ i again then we have s 0 as i and μ i 0 with t remark 3 in the condition μ 1 e r 1 1 and a 3 is of the order o μ moreover formula 34 becomes e τ e q i 0 5 μ a 0 i a 1 i a 2 i a 3 i i 1 2 3 we obtain that the magnitude of the quantization error e τ e q brought by the equivalent term τ q e q is of the order o μ if μ 1 3 3 sliding mode control with input and state quantization in this subsection we obtain results analogous to those given in section 3 2 for the auv system whose both state and input are quantized suppose that the smc law with quantized state feedback τ q is not implementable and only the quantized measurement τ ˆ q is available as shown in fig 1 then the quantized control input law becomes 35 τ ˆ q μ τ round τ q μ τ where μ τ is the quantization parameter of the uniform quantizer in the side of control input the formula 2 can be rewritten as 36 m υ c υ υ d υ υ τ ˆ q d t theorem 3 consider the closed system consisting of the auv 1 and 36 with unknown time varying disturbances under assumption 1 uniform quantized state feedback the finite time disturbance observer 5 6 and the quantized control input τ ˆ q 35 with the smc law τ q τ q e q τ q s the control terms τ q e q and τ q s are shown in 25 26 where α i 0 5 μ a 0 i a 1 i a 2 i a 3 i γ 0 5 μ τ 3 μ 1 i 1 2 3 the parameters μ γ and a j i j 0 1 2 3 are defined in theorem 2 μ τ is the quantization parameter in the side of control input the system state will reach the boundary layer s ω and stay in it thereafter then by the adjustment of the quantization parameter μ the trajectory of the closed system can be driven onto the sliding surface s t 0 and the tracking error will finally converge to zero asymptotically proof denoting e τ q τ ˆ q τ q from 35 we have e τ q 0 5 3 μ τ it follows that τ ˆ q τ q e τ q τ q e q τ q s e τ q with the quantized control input τ ˆ q as shown in 35 the time derivative of s becomes 37 s τ e q τ q e q r m 1 e τ q r r q 1 2 α sign s q after d becomes equal to d o b s in a finite time if the conditions in theorem 3 hold s 0 which indicates that s enters ϒ monotonically in the region ϒ the proof is very similar to that of theorem 2 and is omitted here for the sake of brevity 4 simulation studies in this section simulation studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method the hydrodynamic parameters of the auv dynamic model are shown in table 1 pettersen and egeland 1999 xiang et al 2015 the initial states of the auv are given as η 0 1 9 0 5 t and υ 0 1 1 0 1 t the unknown disturbances with significantly large magnitude and high frequency which can be considered as complex environmental disturbances are given as d 6 sin 0 2 t π 5 2 cos t π 6 cos 2 t t the parameters of observer are chosen as λ 0 3 λ 1 1 5 λ 2 1 1 and l 5 5 for the controller parameters we choose c 1 2 and γ 0 1 the initial value of the uniform quantization parameter in the state feedback side is μ 0 2 and the static quantization parameter in the control input side is μ τ 0 1 the desired auv position and heading are η d 2 t 3 sin 0 5 t 0 3 t with η d 2 1 5 cos 0 5 t 0 t and η d 0 0 75 sin 0 5 t 0 t the simulation results are depicted in figs 2 6 the designed trajectory and the actual trajectory are shown in fig 2 which indicates the auv follows the designed trajectory well with the designed smc method as shown in fig 3 the trajectory tracking errors of auv i e x e y e and ψ e are converging to zero it is illustrated that the actual ship position x y and yaw angle ψ can track the desired trajectory η d x d y d ψ d t at a good precision in around 5 s fig 4 shows that the unknown disturbances can be observed in a finite time as shown in fig 5 the system trajectories can be driven onto the sliding mode surface and finally involved in the neighborhood of the origin fig 6 shows the response of the quantization parameter μ by the proposed method it can be observed that the evolution of the quantization parameter is a piecewise constant form 5 conclusion in this paper the problem of tracking control of auvs in the presence of unknown disturbances and quantized state feedback and control input has been investigated a smc method is designed by adding the bound of quantization error to the switching term of smc to force the state variables of the closed system to converge to the origin a finite time observer is used to observe the unknown disturbances finally the simulation results show the performance of the proposed smc approach acknowledgment this work

23612,more attentions have been focused on the ultimate bearing capacity rather than the cyclic deformation process of suction anchors under cyclic loads in previous researches few researches are reported about the finite element analysis for the cyclic deformation process of suction anchors in soft clays because lacking the suitable constitutive model that can not only describe reasonably the cyclic stress strain responses of soft clays but also can be easily implemented into 3d nonlinear finite element analysis codes the cyclic deformation process of suction anchor subjected to the combined static and cyclic loads are investigated by conducting model tests under 1 g condition and the cyclic behaviors are simulated using the finite element method based on the umat subroutine for an elastoplastic bounding surface model proposed by the authors the predictions show that the cyclic deformation process of suction anchor in soft clays can be simulated well by using the constitutive model and setting appropriate finite element calculation parameters the cyclic displacement time history and load displacement response of the suction anchor can be predicted by the finite element analysis and the predictions are in good agreement with the test results the failure modes of anchors can be predicted well because the predicted displacement components along vertical and horizontal directions are basically consistent with the experimental results in addition the cyclic bearing capacity of anchors can also be determined according to appropriate displacement failure criterion keywords suction anchor soft clay cyclic loads model test finite element analysis constitutive model 1 introduction suction anchors subjected to inclined loads at the optimal load attachment point are important mooring foundations of deepwater floating structures ravichandran et al 2015 they are usually installed in soft clays and subjected to static tensional and cyclic loads along the mooring direction in the marine environment anderson 2009 so analyzing the cyclic deformation process of anchors is very important to evaluate their stability under the combination of static and cyclic loads in soft clays if the cyclic deformation process is properly analyzed the failure mechanisms of the suction anchors can be well understood meanwhile the design capabilities of foundations can be improved so far some researches have been reported on the model tests of suction anchors under cyclic loads andresen et al dyvik et al 1993 andersen et al 1993 conducted field model tests in clays to study the bearing capacities of suction anchors under vertical cyclic loads clukey and morrison clukey et al 1993 conducted centrifuge model tests in clays under 10 g condition to study the uplift bearing capacity of suction anchors under vertical cyclic loads el gharbawy and olson 1998 1999 conducted laboratory model tests of suction anchors under 1 g condition and studied the effects of cyclic frequency and drainage condition etc on the bearing capacity and failure modes of suction anchors when the top of anchor was subjected to vertical or inclined cyclic loads allersma et al 2000a 2000b conducted centrifuge model tests of suction anchors under cyclic and long term vertical loading in clays and sands separately and studied the effects of aspect ratio of anchor cyclic load amplitude and loading rate etc on the bearing capacity chen and randolph chen and randolph 2007a chen and randolph 2007b chen et al 2009 conducted a series of centrifuge tests of suction anchors in normally consolidated lightly over consolidated and sensitive clays to investigate the uplift capacity and external radial stress changes of the anchors under sustained loading and cyclic loading wang and li 2015 conducted a series of model tests under 1 g condition to research the bearing capacity of suction anchors subjected to inclined average and cyclic loads at the optimal loading point as we can see above more attentions have been focused on the ultimate bearing capacity and the relevant influencing factors such as cyclic loading frequency loading amplitude and rate etc in previous researches the researches about the cyclic deformation process of suction anchors subjected to inclined average and cyclic loads at the optimal loading point are relatively less some researches have also been reported on the finite element analysis of suction anchors under static or cyclic loads so far sukumaran et al 1999 presented a technique of finite element analysis to determine the capacity of suction anchor subjected to lateral loads in soft clays under undrained condition the linear elasticity model with the von mises strength criterion was used to describe the deformation and strength of clays during finite element calculation cao et al 2003 developed a finite element model for simulating the behavior of suction anchors subjected to vertical loading in normally consolidated clays the modified cam clay model was used to describe the stress strain behavior of the porous soil material and the contact surface approach was used to set the interaction of soil and anchor maniar 2004 proposed a computational procedure based on abaqus software package that can simulate the installation process and the load displacement response of anchors subjected to axial and inclined loads nonlinear behavior of the clayey soil was described by means of a bounding surface model the soil domains were discretized using water saturated porous finite elements while the anchor was discretized using the solid finite elements monajemi and razak 2009 presented a finite element study of suction anchor subjected to the combined v h m loading the effects of soil properties on the failure mechanism and ultimate capacity of the anchor were investigated by conducting the non linear analysis using a simplified elastic perfectly plastic model for saturated clays wang et al 2011 developed a preudo static elastoplastic 3d finite element method based on the concept of cyclic shear strength of soil to evaluate the cyclic bearing capacities of suction anchors with the taut mooring system in soft clays given the above the researches are more about the finite element analysis for behaviors of suction anchors subjected to static loads rather than cyclic loads besides the preudo static finite element method can only determine approximately the bearing capacity of suction anchors under cyclic loads but can not simulate the cyclic deformation process the finite element analysis for behaviors of suction anchors subjected to cyclic loads in soft clays are few reported the main difficulty in this aspect is the lack of constitutive models that can not only describe reasonably the stress strain responses of soft clays under cyclic loads but also can be easily implemented into 3d nonlinear finite element analysis codes an elastoplastic bounding surface model that can describe the undrained cyclic stress strain responses of soft clays has been developed and encoded in abaqus through the subroutine umat by the authors cheng and wang 2016 the objectives of this study are to investigate the cyclic deformation process of suction anchor under cyclic loads by conducting model tests and simulate the cyclic behaviors using the finite element method based on the umat subroutine 2 model tests of suction anchors 2 1 model test apparatus model tests were conducted in the test tank with 1 5m in length 1m in width and 1 2m in height the soft clays for the model tests were prepared using the vacuum preloading method wang and li 2015 and clay slurry collected from bohai bay beach of tianjin china the unit weight the plastic limit the liquid limit the plastic index and the sensitivity of the clay are 17 5 kn m3 27 01 44 44 17 43 and 4 0 respectively the vane shear strength of the soft clay s u varies almost linearly from 3 to 14 kpa with depth of the stratum as shown in fig 1 the model anchor was made of stainless steel the outer wall of the anchor was covered with the metal wire mesh to increase the friction between the outer wall and the stratum as shown in fig 2 the vertical bearing capacity was improved by increasing the friction between them an air vent valve was set at the top of anchor to penetrate the anchor into the stratum by using the vacuum negative pressure device a plexiglass window was also set at the top of anchor to observe the variation of soil plug during penetration process adjustable loading points were set at the outer wall of the anchor to determine the position of the optimal loading point as shown in fig 2 the diameter of the model anchor is 15 2 cm the distance from the optimal loading point to the top of anchor is about 27 cm when the angle between loading direction and horizontal direction is 30 the parameters of the model anchor are shown in table 1 the value of interface shear strength factor is assumed to be equal to the inverse of the sensitivity veritas 2005 that is equal to 0 25 and it is approximately equal to the value of 0 26 obtained from the vertical pullout tests wang and li 2015 because the big disturbance during installation of anchor and the high sensitivity of clay the value of the interface shear strength factor is relative low compared with the typical value in the prototype test however it is closer to the real situation of the model test performed by us the oriented loading apparatus was developed as shown in fig 3 the apparatus consisted of the loading frame the oriented plate and oriented pulleys installed on the oriented plate the upper pulley was fixed and the mooring direction was changed by regulating the location of the lower pulley the model tests were conducted using the multifunctional electric servo control loading device developed by authors wang et al 2012 the arrangements of displacement and load sensors are also shown in fig 3 the lvdt 1 was used to measure the displacement of the load attachment point and the lvdt 2 and lvdt 3 were used to measure the vertical displacement of anchor and determine the rotation of anchor the electric displacement gauge was used to measure the lateral displacement of anchor the load cell was used to measure the force along the loading direction the additional weight w was applied to the top of anchor to increase the vertical ultimate uplift capacity during loading for part of tests as shown in fig 4 2 2 model test methods model tests include monotonic loading tests constant amplitude and variable amplitude cyclic loading tests the additional vertical weight of 30 kg was applied to the top of anchor to increase the vertical ultimate uplift capacity during constant amplitude cyclic loading tests as shown in fig 4 however no additional vertical weight was applied to the top of anchor during variable amplitude cyclic loading tests four monotonic loading tests were firstly performed to obtain the normalized load displacement curve and the failure criteria of displacement and two of four tests were performed with the additional vertical weight then the cyclic loading tests were performed and initial static tensional load was applied to anchors based on the normalized load displacement curve during tests 1 monotonic loading tests were conducted according to following steps step1 the shear strengths of the stratum were measured by vane shear tests for each model test the anchor was penetrated into the stratum the test was conducted after staying one week to decrease the effect of penetration disturbance on test results wang and li 2015 step2 the inclined load was applied to the optimal loading point of the anchor under monotonic displacement controlled mode with the velocity of 0 01 m h the additional vertical weight of 30 kg was applied to the top of anchor to increase the vertical ultimate uplift capacity during loading for two tests the load and displacement along the loading direction at the loading point were measured as well as the vertical and lateral displacements of the anchor top using the transducers shown in fig 3 the failure of anchor occurred and the tests was stopped when the load grew no longer with the growth of displacement along the loading direction at the loading point f and f f express the inclined load at the loading point and the static bearing capacity of suction anchor under monotonic loads respectively the normalized load is defined as f f f normalized load displacement curves along the loading direction at the loading point were determined based on the results of model tests with and without additional weight as shown in fig 5 because tests were conducted at different locations in the model test tank and soil shear strengths at different locations had some difference the ultimate bearing capacities associated with different locations were also different however load displacement curves had good normalized behavior for different static model tests as shown in fig 5 the displacements along the loading direction at the loading point were 0 5 and 0 6 times the diameter of anchor for model tests with and without additional weight when the failure occurred respectively it should be noted that the failure displacement is associated with the diameter of anchor the failure modes the loading direction and so on so the values are only suitable for the case in this paper not for all cases 2 constant amplitude cyclic loading tests were conducted according to following steps step1 this step was the same as that in monotonic loading tests step2 an static tensional load average load was applied to the anchor based on curves in fig 5 a when the displacement under the average load reached the displacement associated with the predetermined normalized load on the curves the load was the predetermined average load the static bearing capacity associated with the average load was determined using eq 1 1 f f f a f a f f where f f is the static bearing capacity f a is the average load applied to the anchor and f a f f is the predetermined normalized average load step3 sinusoidal cyclic loads with the peak value of f c y and the frequency of 0 1 hz were applied to the anchor based on the predetermined cyclic load ratio f c y f f tests were stopped when the sum of the static displacement and the cyclic cumulative displacement along the loading direction at the loading point was over 0 5 times the anchor diameter the test programs are shown in table 2 3 variable amplitude cyclic loading tests were conducted according to following steps step1 and step2 were the same as that in constant amplitude cyclic loading tests step3 three sinusoidal cyclic loading packets with the peak value of f c y 1 f c y 2 and f c y 3 were applied to the anchor in turn based on the predetermined cyclic load ratios f c y 1 f f f c y 2 f f and f c y 3 f f the loading frequency was 0 1 hz and the number of load cycles was n 1 n 2 and n 3 for three loading packets respectively tests were stopped when the sum of the static displacement and the cyclic cumulative displacement was over 0 6 times the anchor diameter the test programs are shown in table 3 2 3 model test results 2 3 1 constant amplitude cyclic loading test results fig 6 shows the measured displacement time curves along the mooring direction vertical and horizontal directions at the mooring point for constant amplitude cyclic loading tests the cyclic cumulative displacement permanent displacement is larger than cyclic displacement in every direction and too large cyclic cumulative displacement is the main reason that leads to the failure of anchors the cyclic cumulative displacement is larger in horizontal direction than vertical direction fig 7 shows the displacement time curves along the mooring direction at the mooring point for tests with different cyclic load levels as can be seen from the figure the cyclic cumulative displacement increases faster for higher cyclic load level when the static load level keeps constant resulting in the number of cycles to failure decreasing the cyclic displacement amplitude does not change with the increase of the number of cycles significantly however it shows obvious increase as the cyclic load level increases the anchor at failure is shown in fig 13 a the horizontal displacement of the anchor is greater than the vertical displacement thus the failure of anchor tends to the horizontal failure mode wang and li 2015 a big crack occurs in the soils of active regions meanwhile the soils are compressed and uplifted in the passive regions 2 3 2 variable amplitude cyclic loading test results fig 8 shows the measured displacement time curves along the mooring direction vertical and horizontal directions at the mooring point for variable amplitude cyclic loading tests the cyclic cumulative displacement and cyclic displacement increase with the increase of cyclic load level when the static load level keeps constant for each test too large cyclic cumulative displacement is the main reason that leads to the failure of anchors the cyclic cumulative displacement is larger in vertical than horizontal direction for each test as shown in fig 8 d the cyclic cumulative displacement is smaller in the third stage than the first stage though the cyclic load levels are the same for two stages which indicates that previous cyclic loading history has a significant effect on subsequent load displacement responses of anchors and this point can be better understood by fig 9 d fig 9 shows the measured load displacement curves along the mooring direction at the mooring point for variable amplitude cyclic loading tests the load displacement curves show significant nonlinear hysteretic behaviours and the hysteresis loops become larger as cyclic load level increases the load displacement responses are closely related to current load level and previous loading histories the results of model test numbered as t5 at the end of every stages are shown in fig 17 a a small cumulative displacement occurs for the anchor in both horizontal and vertical directions at the end of the first stage a small crack occurs between the outer wall of anchor and the soils in active regions however there is no significant change in passive regions the cumulative displacement increases significantly and the crack becomes larger at the end of the second stage the failure of anchor occurs because of too large cumulative displacement at the end of the third stage and the vertical displacement is greater than horizontal displacement thus the failure of anchor tends to the vertical failure mode wang and li 2015 many cracks occur in the passive regions because the soils are compressed and uplifted 3 numerical simulation of suction anchors 3 1 geometries and meshes the 3d finite element model was established based on the model test conditions as shown in fig 10 considering the symmetries of geometries and loading conditions the model was established according to a half portion of the foundation to improve the calculation efficiency the anchors and the soils were all simulated using 8 node linear brick elements horizontal constraints were applied to the vertical boundaries and fixed constraints were applied to the bottom boundary the top boundary was fully free the anchor was treated as a rigid body during calculations because the model test results showed that the soil plug within the anchor remained in close contact with the inner wall of the anchor during loading due to large negative pressure the tie contact condition was set between the soil plug and the inner wall besides relative displacements and the separation could occur between the outer wall of the anchor and the stratum so the contact conditions of the tangential slip and normal separation were set between the outer wall and the stratum the tangential slip conditions were set according to the maximum tangential shear stress as represented by eq 2 2 τ max α s u where τ max is the maximum shear stress on the interfaces α is the interface shear strength factor that describes the shaft friction property between the wall of anchor and the surrounding soils and the value is set to 0 26 s u is the undrained shear strength of the soil 3 2 constitutive model and material parameters the constitutive model that can describe the undrained cyclic stress strain responses of soft clays is the key to analyze the deformation process of suction anchor under cyclic loads in soft clays it should be pointed out that the local drainage takes place in the soils range about the radius of the anchor around the suction anchor however for the convenience of calculation the total volumetric strain produced by the drainage of soils in the local drained area is ignored with considering only the deviatoric strain when calculating the deformation of soils thus the whole soil body is considered to be undrained with ignoring the local drainage in this study an elastoplastic bounding surface model for soft clays has been developed and encoded in abaqus through the subroutine umat by the authors cheng and wang 2016 relevant static and cyclic laboratory tests for the clay used in model tests can be seen in the paper a brief introduction is made about the constitutive model and parameters as follows 3 2 1 constitute model the model is developed based on anisotropic hardening modulus field theory and bounding surface theory the stress strain relationship is expressed in the form of total stress the total volumetric strain is zero under undrained conditions so the yielding and failure of soft clays are considered to be independent on the volumetric stress cheng and wang 2016 the evolution of the hardening modulus is described in the deviatoric stress space the model includes three basic equations the bounding surface equation describing the failure of soil elements the relationship describing the evolution of the hardening modulus and the incremental elastoplastic deviatoric stress strain relationship the bounding surface equation is described using the von mises function as shown in eq 3 3 f 3 2 s i j s i j a 0 2 0 where s i j denotes the deviatoric stress tensor of the bounding surface and a 0 denotes the radius of the bounding surface the evolution of the elastoplastic hardening modulus is described using eq 4 the mapping rule for loading and unloading is schematically shown in fig 11 and s k s k and s k denote the mapping centre point the current stress point and the image stress point respectively the image stress point is defined as the intersection point of the bounding surface and a line passing through the mapping centre point and the current stress point the initial loading point is the mapping centre during initial loading the stress reversal point is treated as the mapping centre for unloading and reloading after stress reversal 4 h δ δ 0 μ h max where h denotes the elastoplastic modulus of the current stress point δ is the distance between the current stress point and the image stress point δ 0 is the distance between the mapping centre and the image stress point h max represents the maximum elastoplastic modulus and μ is the undetermined relationship that reflects the cumulative rate and the level of cumulative shear strain as expressed in eq 5 5 μ μ 0 d γ 8 p where d γ 8 p denotes the octahedral cyclic cumulative shear strain increment after each stress cycle depends on the stress history and current cyclic stress level and controls the trends of the cumulative shear strain versus the number of stress cycles as shown in fig 12 and the coefficient μ 0 controls the level of the cumulative shear strain after a certain number of stress cycles the plastic deviatoric strain increment is calculated according to the associative flow rule and eq 3 the elastic deviatoric strain increment is obtained according to the generalised hooke s law thus the elastoplastic deviatoric stress strain relationship is represented by eq 6 6 d e i j 1 2 g d s i j 3 2 h s i j a 0 2 s k l d s k l where de ij is the deviatoric strain increment g is the elastic shear modulus and g h max 2 ds ij is the deviatoric stress increment s i j is the deviatoric stress at the image stress point h is the plastic shear modulus and h 2 g h 2 g h 3 2 2 model parameters the above model includes two undetermined parameters a 0 and g and two undetermined relationships d γ 8 p and μ 0 the model parameters for the soft clay used in the model tests are determined using the method suggested by the authors cheng and wang 2016 to predict the model test results by the finite element method the unconsolidated undrained triaxial compression tests with consideration of rate effects were performed to determine a 0 and g a 0 represents the radius of the bounding surface and g represents the initial tangent modulus of the initial stress strain curve the values of two parameters can be obtained based on test results and g 205 kpa a 0 27 kpa the values vary almost linearly with the undrained shear strength s u and satisfy eqs 7 and 8 7 a 0 3 38 s u 8 g 25 6 s u the values of two parameters need to be set by eqs 7 and 8 according to the strength of the stratum because s u varies almost linearly with depth of penetration in the tank the stratum is divided into 8 sublayers and each sublayer is 1m thick the shear strength of each sublayer is thought uniform and equals to the value of shear strength at midpoint of sublayer the unconsolidated undrained cyclic triaxial compression tests for soft clays under combined different static and cyclic stresses were performed to determine d γ 8 p and μ 0 the typical stress strain curve is shown in fig 12 γ 8 a is the octahedral static shear strain caused by the octahedral average shear stress τ 8 a and γ 8 p is the octahedral cyclic cumulative shear strain caused by octahedral cyclic shear stress τ 8 c y in fig 12 the relationship between γ 8 p and the number of stress cycles is determined based on the test results with different combinations of the octahedral average shear stress ratio τ 8 a τ 8 f and the octahedral cyclic shear stress ratio τ 8 c y τ 8 f τ 8 f is the octahedral shear stress at failure the relationship can be expressed as eq 9 the undetermined parameters c and d in eq 9 are expressed as functions of τ 8 a τ 8 f and τ 8 c y τ 8 f and d γ 8 p is obtained based on eq 9 as expressed in eq 10 9 γ 8 p c n d 10 d γ 8 p c d n d 1 where c 0 031 e τ 8 a τ 8 f 0 165 1 296 τ 8 c y τ 8 f d 9 34 e 3 e τ 8 a τ 8 f 0 145 1 321 τ 8 c y τ 8 f and n is the number of stress cycles parameter μ 0 is determined using a series of the trial and error calculations cheng and wang 2016 as shown in eq 11 the assumed μ 0 value associated with the specified τ 8 a τ 8 f and τ 8 c y τ 8 f is correct when the model predicted results agree with the test results of the relationship between γ 8 p and n 11 μ 0 99 84 3 26874 e 4 τ 8 c y τ 8 f 0 3 τ 8 a τ 8 f 3 3 analysis steps the deformation process of suction anchors subjected to combined static and cyclic loads was analysed according to two steps as follows 1 the static load f a was applied to the anchors the perfect elastoplastic model with the mises yield criterion was used during calculations the elastic modulus of soft clays was taken as 150 times the undrained shear strength s u poisson s ratio was 0 49 the octahedral average shear stress ratio τ 8 a τ 8 f of each soil element was determined based on the calculation results 2 a sinusoidal constant amplitude cyclic loading packet with the peak value of f cy was applied to the anchor along the direction of the static load for simulations of constant amplitude cyclic loading tests three sinusoidal constant amplitude cyclic loading packets with the peak value of f cy1 f cy2 and f cy3 were applied to the anchors in turn for simulations of variable amplitude cyclic loading tests the cyclic loads were divided into a series of incremental load steps and the deformation of the suction anchor was calculated using the finite element method by calling the subroutine umat for the constitutive model proposed by the authors based on these model parameters in section 3 2 2 the octahedral cyclic shear stress ratio τ 8 c y τ 8 f of each soil element was determined based on the calculation results of each loading cycle in addition the number of stress cycles n was assumed as the number of load cycles applied to the anchor then the model parameters were updated according to the calculated τ 8 a τ 8 f τ 8 c y τ 8 f and n based on eqs 10 and 11 it should be pointed out that the previous cyclic loading history has a significant effect on the deformation produced by subsequent loading for multistage cyclic loading tests the concept equivalent number of load cycles andersen et al 1996 kaggwa et al 1991 should be used in the research to consider the effects of the previous cyclic loading history and the current load level on subsequent deformation of soils according to the concept the equivalent number of load cycles means the number of cycles at loading level of a new load packet that would produce the same permanent deformation or permanent pore pressure as that produced by all previous cyclic loading thus the number of load cycles at the beginning of a new load packet should be equal to the equivalent number of load cycles of the previous load packet however during the finite element calculation in this study the constitutive model proposed by the authors has some difficulty in considering the effect of the irregular loading stress history the umat subroutine is unable to calculate the equivalent number of stress cycles of the previous load packet and then update the number of stress cycles at the beginning of a new load packet thus the number of load cycles at the beginning of a new load packet is tentatively assumed to be equal to the number of load cycles at the end of the previous load packet with ignoring the impact of previous irregular stress time history when simulating variable amplitude cyclic loading tests in this study the solution to this limitation will be further elaborated in later research work 4 comparisons of predictions and model test results 4 1 simulation for constant amplitude cyclic loading tests the typical test result and prediction for the anchor at failure are shown in fig 13 a and b respectively the translational motion of the anchor occurs and the horizontal cumulative displacement is greater than the vertical cumulative displacement in fig 13 b the separation occurs between the outer wall of anchor and the soils in the active regions meanwhile the soils are compressed and uplifted in the passive regions these predictions are consistant with the test results fig 14 shows the comparisons of predicted and measured displacement time curves along the mooring direction at the mooring point the predicted results show that the displacements increase rapidly at the beginning of cyclic loading and then the increasing rate gradually decreases as the number of load cycles increases the predictions are generally in agreement with test results however it is seen that the calculated rate of cumulative displacement at the beginning of the tests is larger than the measured rate the reason may be that the constitutive model used in numerical analysis underestimated the cumulative shear strain in predicting the cyclic triaxial tests the calculated rate of γ 8 p in eq 9 for many soil elements around the anchor at the beginning of cyclic loading is larger than the test results as shown in fig 15 which may result that the calculated rate of cumulative displacement of anchor at the beginning of the model tests is larger than the measured rate the cyclic bearing capacity can be predicted based on an appropriate failure criterion of displacement after obtaining the displacement time curves the failure criterion is 0 5 times the diameter of the anchor which is determined based on the monotonic loading tests it is assumed that the failure criterion is suitable to the anchor under average static and cyclic loads when the failure mode is the same as that under monotonic loads because the average and cyclic loads will result in static and cyclic cumulative displacements of suction anchor failure occurs when the sum of static and cyclic cumulative displacements reaches the failure criterion the cyclic bearing capacity and the number of cycles to failure are predicted according to the failure criterion for constant amplitude cyclic loading tests the test results and predictions of the number of load cycles to failure are denoted as n f and n f separately as shown in table 2 the maximum relative error between the predictions and test results is less than 10 the cyclic bearing capacity f f c y associated with n f is determined based on f f c y f a f c y f the predictions and test results of f f c y f f versus n f are shown in fig 16 they can be fitted using the same straight line in semi logarithm coordinate which indicates the predictions have good agreements with test results so the cyclic bearing capacity can also be well predicted using the finite element method 4 2 simulation for variable amplitude cyclic loading tests the test results and predictions of model test numbered as t5 at the end of every stages are shown in fig 17 the predictions show that the translational motion occurs for the anchor under cyclic loads and the cyclic cumulative displacement increases gradually as the cyclic load level increases the large cumulative displacement occurs for the anchor in both horizontal and vertical directions when the failure occurs at the end of the third stage the predicted results are generally in agreement with the test results in every stages however the cracking of soils in passive regions cannot be captured using the finite element method fig 18 shows a comparison of the predicted and measured displacement time curves along the mooring direction at the mooring point the predicted results show that the cyclic cumulative displacement and cyclic displacement increase with the increase of cyclic load level when the static load level keeps constant for each test the displacements increase rapidly during initial cyclic loading and then the increasing rate gradually decreases as the number of load cycles increases in every stages as mentioned in the simulation for constant amplitude cyclic loading tests because of the limitation of the constitutive model to fit the cyclic triaxial tests the calculated rate of cumulative displacement of anchor at the beginning of every stages is larger than the measured rate as a result the predictions and test results have some difference in every stages and even relatively large difference in some stage as shown in the figures besides the cracking of soils in passive regions and the accumulation of pore pressure cannot be captured by using the finite element method which will also cause the deviations between the predicted and tested results however the predicted results are basically in agreement with test results despite some deviations the predicted load displacement curve along the mooring direction at the mooring point for test t5 is shown in fig 19 the predicted hysteresis loops reveal the nonlinear responses of the foundation and the nonlinear responses become more significant as the cyclic load level increases the predictions are in good agreement with the test results as shown in fig 9 a which indicates that the load displacement responses of anchor under cyclic loads in soft clays can be simulated by the finite element method the comparisons of predicted and measured results for the horizontal and vertical cyclic cumulative displacements at the mooring point are shown in fig 20 the symbols and lines denote the test results and predicted results separately the predicted vertical cumulative displacements are much larger than the horizontal cumulative displacements which are consistent with the test results the predictions basically agree with the test results of the cyclic cumulative displacements in two directions despite some deviations 5 conclusions the cyclic deformation process of suction anchor subjected to the combined static and cyclic loads are investigated by conducting model tests then the cyclic behaviors of suction anchor in soft clays are simulated using the finite element method the key conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the displacement time curves along the mooring direction vertical and horizontal directions at the mooring point are obtained by performing constant and variable amplitude cyclic loading tests test results show that the cyclic cumulative displacement is larger than cyclic displacement in every direction and too large cyclic cumulative displacement is the main reason that leads to the failure of anchor the cyclic cumulative displacement is larger in horizontal than vertical direction and the horizontal failure mode of anchor tends to occur for constant amplitude tests because additional vertical weight is applied to the top of anchor to increase the vertical ultimate uplift capacity and that is really just the opposite for variable amplitude tests without additional vertical weight the higher the cyclic load level the less the number of cycles to failure for constant amplitude tests the cyclic cumulative displacement and cyclic displacement increase with the increase of cyclic load level when the static load level keeps constant for each variable amplitude test in addition the previous cyclic loading history has a significant effect on the deformation produced by subsequent loading 2 the cyclic displacement time history of the suction anchor under constant or variable amplitude cyclic loads can be predicted by the finite element analysis however because of the limitation of the constitutive model to fit the cyclic triaxial tests the calculated rate of cumulative displacement at the beginning of the tests is larger than the measured rate as a result the predictions and test results have some difference besides the cracking of soils in passive regions and the accumulation of pore pressure cannot be captured by using the finite element method which will also cause the deviations however the predicted results are basically in agreement with test results despite some deviations the failure modes of anchor can be predicted well because the predicted displacement components along vertical and horizontal directions are consistent with the experimental results on the trend the significant nonlinear responses of the foundation at different cyclic load levels can be revealed by the predicted hysteresis loops obviously the failure mechanism and failure modes of the suction anchors in soft clays can be well understood by analysing the cyclic deformation process 3 the cyclic bearing capacity can be determined according to appropriate displacement failure criterion after obtaining the cyclic displacement time history of the suction anchor the maximum relative error between the predictions and test results for logarithm of the number of load cycles to failure is less than 10 the predictions and test results of cyclic bearing capacity versus the number of cycles to failure meet the same linear relationship in semi logarithmic coordinate which indicates the cyclic bearing capacity can be predicted well by the finite element analysis though the cyclic behaviors of reduced scale suction anchor in soft clays are simulated well using the finite element method in this study the applicability of the numerical method to real offshore conditions should be further

23612,more attentions have been focused on the ultimate bearing capacity rather than the cyclic deformation process of suction anchors under cyclic loads in previous researches few researches are reported about the finite element analysis for the cyclic deformation process of suction anchors in soft clays because lacking the suitable constitutive model that can not only describe reasonably the cyclic stress strain responses of soft clays but also can be easily implemented into 3d nonlinear finite element analysis codes the cyclic deformation process of suction anchor subjected to the combined static and cyclic loads are investigated by conducting model tests under 1 g condition and the cyclic behaviors are simulated using the finite element method based on the umat subroutine for an elastoplastic bounding surface model proposed by the authors the predictions show that the cyclic deformation process of suction anchor in soft clays can be simulated well by using the constitutive model and setting appropriate finite element calculation parameters the cyclic displacement time history and load displacement response of the suction anchor can be predicted by the finite element analysis and the predictions are in good agreement with the test results the failure modes of anchors can be predicted well because the predicted displacement components along vertical and horizontal directions are basically consistent with the experimental results in addition the cyclic bearing capacity of anchors can also be determined according to appropriate displacement failure criterion keywords suction anchor soft clay cyclic loads model test finite element analysis constitutive model 1 introduction suction anchors subjected to inclined loads at the optimal load attachment point are important mooring foundations of deepwater floating structures ravichandran et al 2015 they are usually installed in soft clays and subjected to static tensional and cyclic loads along the mooring direction in the marine environment anderson 2009 so analyzing the cyclic deformation process of anchors is very important to evaluate their stability under the combination of static and cyclic loads in soft clays if the cyclic deformation process is properly analyzed the failure mechanisms of the suction anchors can be well understood meanwhile the design capabilities of foundations can be improved so far some researches have been reported on the model tests of suction anchors under cyclic loads andresen et al dyvik et al 1993 andersen et al 1993 conducted field model tests in clays to study the bearing capacities of suction anchors under vertical cyclic loads clukey and morrison clukey et al 1993 conducted centrifuge model tests in clays under 10 g condition to study the uplift bearing capacity of suction anchors under vertical cyclic loads el gharbawy and olson 1998 1999 conducted laboratory model tests of suction anchors under 1 g condition and studied the effects of cyclic frequency and drainage condition etc on the bearing capacity and failure modes of suction anchors when the top of anchor was subjected to vertical or inclined cyclic loads allersma et al 2000a 2000b conducted centrifuge model tests of suction anchors under cyclic and long term vertical loading in clays and sands separately and studied the effects of aspect ratio of anchor cyclic load amplitude and loading rate etc on the bearing capacity chen and randolph chen and randolph 2007a chen and randolph 2007b chen et al 2009 conducted a series of centrifuge tests of suction anchors in normally consolidated lightly over consolidated and sensitive clays to investigate the uplift capacity and external radial stress changes of the anchors under sustained loading and cyclic loading wang and li 2015 conducted a series of model tests under 1 g condition to research the bearing capacity of suction anchors subjected to inclined average and cyclic loads at the optimal loading point as we can see above more attentions have been focused on the ultimate bearing capacity and the relevant influencing factors such as cyclic loading frequency loading amplitude and rate etc in previous researches the researches about the cyclic deformation process of suction anchors subjected to inclined average and cyclic loads at the optimal loading point are relatively less some researches have also been reported on the finite element analysis of suction anchors under static or cyclic loads so far sukumaran et al 1999 presented a technique of finite element analysis to determine the capacity of suction anchor subjected to lateral loads in soft clays under undrained condition the linear elasticity model with the von mises strength criterion was used to describe the deformation and strength of clays during finite element calculation cao et al 2003 developed a finite element model for simulating the behavior of suction anchors subjected to vertical loading in normally consolidated clays the modified cam clay model was used to describe the stress strain behavior of the porous soil material and the contact surface approach was used to set the interaction of soil and anchor maniar 2004 proposed a computational procedure based on abaqus software package that can simulate the installation process and the load displacement response of anchors subjected to axial and inclined loads nonlinear behavior of the clayey soil was described by means of a bounding surface model the soil domains were discretized using water saturated porous finite elements while the anchor was discretized using the solid finite elements monajemi and razak 2009 presented a finite element study of suction anchor subjected to the combined v h m loading the effects of soil properties on the failure mechanism and ultimate capacity of the anchor were investigated by conducting the non linear analysis using a simplified elastic perfectly plastic model for saturated clays wang et al 2011 developed a preudo static elastoplastic 3d finite element method based on the concept of cyclic shear strength of soil to evaluate the cyclic bearing capacities of suction anchors with the taut mooring system in soft clays given the above the researches are more about the finite element analysis for behaviors of suction anchors subjected to static loads rather than cyclic loads besides the preudo static finite element method can only determine approximately the bearing capacity of suction anchors under cyclic loads but can not simulate the cyclic deformation process the finite element analysis for behaviors of suction anchors subjected to cyclic loads in soft clays are few reported the main difficulty in this aspect is the lack of constitutive models that can not only describe reasonably the stress strain responses of soft clays under cyclic loads but also can be easily implemented into 3d nonlinear finite element analysis codes an elastoplastic bounding surface model that can describe the undrained cyclic stress strain responses of soft clays has been developed and encoded in abaqus through the subroutine umat by the authors cheng and wang 2016 the objectives of this study are to investigate the cyclic deformation process of suction anchor under cyclic loads by conducting model tests and simulate the cyclic behaviors using the finite element method based on the umat subroutine 2 model tests of suction anchors 2 1 model test apparatus model tests were conducted in the test tank with 1 5m in length 1m in width and 1 2m in height the soft clays for the model tests were prepared using the vacuum preloading method wang and li 2015 and clay slurry collected from bohai bay beach of tianjin china the unit weight the plastic limit the liquid limit the plastic index and the sensitivity of the clay are 17 5 kn m3 27 01 44 44 17 43 and 4 0 respectively the vane shear strength of the soft clay s u varies almost linearly from 3 to 14 kpa with depth of the stratum as shown in fig 1 the model anchor was made of stainless steel the outer wall of the anchor was covered with the metal wire mesh to increase the friction between the outer wall and the stratum as shown in fig 2 the vertical bearing capacity was improved by increasing the friction between them an air vent valve was set at the top of anchor to penetrate the anchor into the stratum by using the vacuum negative pressure device a plexiglass window was also set at the top of anchor to observe the variation of soil plug during penetration process adjustable loading points were set at the outer wall of the anchor to determine the position of the optimal loading point as shown in fig 2 the diameter of the model anchor is 15 2 cm the distance from the optimal loading point to the top of anchor is about 27 cm when the angle between loading direction and horizontal direction is 30 the parameters of the model anchor are shown in table 1 the value of interface shear strength factor is assumed to be equal to the inverse of the sensitivity veritas 2005 that is equal to 0 25 and it is approximately equal to the value of 0 26 obtained from the vertical pullout tests wang and li 2015 because the big disturbance during installation of anchor and the high sensitivity of clay the value of the interface shear strength factor is relative low compared with the typical value in the prototype test however it is closer to the real situation of the model test performed by us the oriented loading apparatus was developed as shown in fig 3 the apparatus consisted of the loading frame the oriented plate and oriented pulleys installed on the oriented plate the upper pulley was fixed and the mooring direction was changed by regulating the location of the lower pulley the model tests were conducted using the multifunctional electric servo control loading device developed by authors wang et al 2012 the arrangements of displacement and load sensors are also shown in fig 3 the lvdt 1 was used to measure the displacement of the load attachment point and the lvdt 2 and lvdt 3 were used to measure the vertical displacement of anchor and determine the rotation of anchor the electric displacement gauge was used to measure the lateral displacement of anchor the load cell was used to measure the force along the loading direction the additional weight w was applied to the top of anchor to increase the vertical ultimate uplift capacity during loading for part of tests as shown in fig 4 2 2 model test methods model tests include monotonic loading tests constant amplitude and variable amplitude cyclic loading tests the additional vertical weight of 30 kg was applied to the top of anchor to increase the vertical ultimate uplift capacity during constant amplitude cyclic loading tests as shown in fig 4 however no additional vertical weight was applied to the top of anchor during variable amplitude cyclic loading tests four monotonic loading tests were firstly performed to obtain the normalized load displacement curve and the failure criteria of displacement and two of four tests were performed with the additional vertical weight then the cyclic loading tests were performed and initial static tensional load was applied to anchors based on the normalized load displacement curve during tests 1 monotonic loading tests were conducted according to following steps step1 the shear strengths of the stratum were measured by vane shear tests for each model test the anchor was penetrated into the stratum the test was conducted after staying one week to decrease the effect of penetration disturbance on test results wang and li 2015 step2 the inclined load was applied to the optimal loading point of the anchor under monotonic displacement controlled mode with the velocity of 0 01 m h the additional vertical weight of 30 kg was applied to the top of anchor to increase the vertical ultimate uplift capacity during loading for two tests the load and displacement along the loading direction at the loading point were measured as well as the vertical and lateral displacements of the anchor top using the transducers shown in fig 3 the failure of anchor occurred and the tests was stopped when the load grew no longer with the growth of displacement along the loading direction at the loading point f and f f express the inclined load at the loading point and the static bearing capacity of suction anchor under monotonic loads respectively the normalized load is defined as f f f normalized load displacement curves along the loading direction at the loading point were determined based on the results of model tests with and without additional weight as shown in fig 5 because tests were conducted at different locations in the model test tank and soil shear strengths at different locations had some difference the ultimate bearing capacities associated with different locations were also different however load displacement curves had good normalized behavior for different static model tests as shown in fig 5 the displacements along the loading direction at the loading point were 0 5 and 0 6 times the diameter of anchor for model tests with and without additional weight when the failure occurred respectively it should be noted that the failure displacement is associated with the diameter of anchor the failure modes the loading direction and so on so the values are only suitable for the case in this paper not for all cases 2 constant amplitude cyclic loading tests were conducted according to following steps step1 this step was the same as that in monotonic loading tests step2 an static tensional load average load was applied to the anchor based on curves in fig 5 a when the displacement under the average load reached the displacement associated with the predetermined normalized load on the curves the load was the predetermined average load the static bearing capacity associated with the average load was determined using eq 1 1 f f f a f a f f where f f is the static bearing capacity f a is the average load applied to the anchor and f a f f is the predetermined normalized average load step3 sinusoidal cyclic loads with the peak value of f c y and the frequency of 0 1 hz were applied to the anchor based on the predetermined cyclic load ratio f c y f f tests were stopped when the sum of the static displacement and the cyclic cumulative displacement along the loading direction at the loading point was over 0 5 times the anchor diameter the test programs are shown in table 2 3 variable amplitude cyclic loading tests were conducted according to following steps step1 and step2 were the same as that in constant amplitude cyclic loading tests step3 three sinusoidal cyclic loading packets with the peak value of f c y 1 f c y 2 and f c y 3 were applied to the anchor in turn based on the predetermined cyclic load ratios f c y 1 f f f c y 2 f f and f c y 3 f f the loading frequency was 0 1 hz and the number of load cycles was n 1 n 2 and n 3 for three loading packets respectively tests were stopped when the sum of the static displacement and the cyclic cumulative displacement was over 0 6 times the anchor diameter the test programs are shown in table 3 2 3 model test results 2 3 1 constant amplitude cyclic loading test results fig 6 shows the measured displacement time curves along the mooring direction vertical and horizontal directions at the mooring point for constant amplitude cyclic loading tests the cyclic cumulative displacement permanent displacement is larger than cyclic displacement in every direction and too large cyclic cumulative displacement is the main reason that leads to the failure of anchors the cyclic cumulative displacement is larger in horizontal direction than vertical direction fig 7 shows the displacement time curves along the mooring direction at the mooring point for tests with different cyclic load levels as can be seen from the figure the cyclic cumulative displacement increases faster for higher cyclic load level when the static load level keeps constant resulting in the number of cycles to failure decreasing the cyclic displacement amplitude does not change with the increase of the number of cycles significantly however it shows obvious increase as the cyclic load level increases the anchor at failure is shown in fig 13 a the horizontal displacement of the anchor is greater than the vertical displacement thus the failure of anchor tends to the horizontal failure mode wang and li 2015 a big crack occurs in the soils of active regions meanwhile the soils are compressed and uplifted in the passive regions 2 3 2 variable amplitude cyclic loading test results fig 8 shows the measured displacement time curves along the mooring direction vertical and horizontal directions at the mooring point for variable amplitude cyclic loading tests the cyclic cumulative displacement and cyclic displacement increase with the increase of cyclic load level when the static load level keeps constant for each test too large cyclic cumulative displacement is the main reason that leads to the failure of anchors the cyclic cumulative displacement is larger in vertical than horizontal direction for each test as shown in fig 8 d the cyclic cumulative displacement is smaller in the third stage than the first stage though the cyclic load levels are the same for two stages which indicates that previous cyclic loading history has a significant effect on subsequent load displacement responses of anchors and this point can be better understood by fig 9 d fig 9 shows the measured load displacement curves along the mooring direction at the mooring point for variable amplitude cyclic loading tests the load displacement curves show significant nonlinear hysteretic behaviours and the hysteresis loops become larger as cyclic load level increases the load displacement responses are closely related to current load level and previous loading histories the results of model test numbered as t5 at the end of every stages are shown in fig 17 a a small cumulative displacement occurs for the anchor in both horizontal and vertical directions at the end of the first stage a small crack occurs between the outer wall of anchor and the soils in active regions however there is no significant change in passive regions the cumulative displacement increases significantly and the crack becomes larger at the end of the second stage the failure of anchor occurs because of too large cumulative displacement at the end of the third stage and the vertical displacement is greater than horizontal displacement thus the failure of anchor tends to the vertical failure mode wang and li 2015 many cracks occur in the passive regions because the soils are compressed and uplifted 3 numerical simulation of suction anchors 3 1 geometries and meshes the 3d finite element model was established based on the model test conditions as shown in fig 10 considering the symmetries of geometries and loading conditions the model was established according to a half portion of the foundation to improve the calculation efficiency the anchors and the soils were all simulated using 8 node linear brick elements horizontal constraints were applied to the vertical boundaries and fixed constraints were applied to the bottom boundary the top boundary was fully free the anchor was treated as a rigid body during calculations because the model test results showed that the soil plug within the anchor remained in close contact with the inner wall of the anchor during loading due to large negative pressure the tie contact condition was set between the soil plug and the inner wall besides relative displacements and the separation could occur between the outer wall of the anchor and the stratum so the contact conditions of the tangential slip and normal separation were set between the outer wall and the stratum the tangential slip conditions were set according to the maximum tangential shear stress as represented by eq 2 2 τ max α s u where τ max is the maximum shear stress on the interfaces α is the interface shear strength factor that describes the shaft friction property between the wall of anchor and the surrounding soils and the value is set to 0 26 s u is the undrained shear strength of the soil 3 2 constitutive model and material parameters the constitutive model that can describe the undrained cyclic stress strain responses of soft clays is the key to analyze the deformation process of suction anchor under cyclic loads in soft clays it should be pointed out that the local drainage takes place in the soils range about the radius of the anchor around the suction anchor however for the convenience of calculation the total volumetric strain produced by the drainage of soils in the local drained area is ignored with considering only the deviatoric strain when calculating the deformation of soils thus the whole soil body is considered to be undrained with ignoring the local drainage in this study an elastoplastic bounding surface model for soft clays has been developed and encoded in abaqus through the subroutine umat by the authors cheng and wang 2016 relevant static and cyclic laboratory tests for the clay used in model tests can be seen in the paper a brief introduction is made about the constitutive model and parameters as follows 3 2 1 constitute model the model is developed based on anisotropic hardening modulus field theory and bounding surface theory the stress strain relationship is expressed in the form of total stress the total volumetric strain is zero under undrained conditions so the yielding and failure of soft clays are considered to be independent on the volumetric stress cheng and wang 2016 the evolution of the hardening modulus is described in the deviatoric stress space the model includes three basic equations the bounding surface equation describing the failure of soil elements the relationship describing the evolution of the hardening modulus and the incremental elastoplastic deviatoric stress strain relationship the bounding surface equation is described using the von mises function as shown in eq 3 3 f 3 2 s i j s i j a 0 2 0 where s i j denotes the deviatoric stress tensor of the bounding surface and a 0 denotes the radius of the bounding surface the evolution of the elastoplastic hardening modulus is described using eq 4 the mapping rule for loading and unloading is schematically shown in fig 11 and s k s k and s k denote the mapping centre point the current stress point and the image stress point respectively the image stress point is defined as the intersection point of the bounding surface and a line passing through the mapping centre point and the current stress point the initial loading point is the mapping centre during initial loading the stress reversal point is treated as the mapping centre for unloading and reloading after stress reversal 4 h δ δ 0 μ h max where h denotes the elastoplastic modulus of the current stress point δ is the distance between the current stress point and the image stress point δ 0 is the distance between the mapping centre and the image stress point h max represents the maximum elastoplastic modulus and μ is the undetermined relationship that reflects the cumulative rate and the level of cumulative shear strain as expressed in eq 5 5 μ μ 0 d γ 8 p where d γ 8 p denotes the octahedral cyclic cumulative shear strain increment after each stress cycle depends on the stress history and current cyclic stress level and controls the trends of the cumulative shear strain versus the number of stress cycles as shown in fig 12 and the coefficient μ 0 controls the level of the cumulative shear strain after a certain number of stress cycles the plastic deviatoric strain increment is calculated according to the associative flow rule and eq 3 the elastic deviatoric strain increment is obtained according to the generalised hooke s law thus the elastoplastic deviatoric stress strain relationship is represented by eq 6 6 d e i j 1 2 g d s i j 3 2 h s i j a 0 2 s k l d s k l where de ij is the deviatoric strain increment g is the elastic shear modulus and g h max 2 ds ij is the deviatoric stress increment s i j is the deviatoric stress at the image stress point h is the plastic shear modulus and h 2 g h 2 g h 3 2 2 model parameters the above model includes two undetermined parameters a 0 and g and two undetermined relationships d γ 8 p and μ 0 the model parameters for the soft clay used in the model tests are determined using the method suggested by the authors cheng and wang 2016 to predict the model test results by the finite element method the unconsolidated undrained triaxial compression tests with consideration of rate effects were performed to determine a 0 and g a 0 represents the radius of the bounding surface and g represents the initial tangent modulus of the initial stress strain curve the values of two parameters can be obtained based on test results and g 205 kpa a 0 27 kpa the values vary almost linearly with the undrained shear strength s u and satisfy eqs 7 and 8 7 a 0 3 38 s u 8 g 25 6 s u the values of two parameters need to be set by eqs 7 and 8 according to the strength of the stratum because s u varies almost linearly with depth of penetration in the tank the stratum is divided into 8 sublayers and each sublayer is 1m thick the shear strength of each sublayer is thought uniform and equals to the value of shear strength at midpoint of sublayer the unconsolidated undrained cyclic triaxial compression tests for soft clays under combined different static and cyclic stresses were performed to determine d γ 8 p and μ 0 the typical stress strain curve is shown in fig 12 γ 8 a is the octahedral static shear strain caused by the octahedral average shear stress τ 8 a and γ 8 p is the octahedral cyclic cumulative shear strain caused by octahedral cyclic shear stress τ 8 c y in fig 12 the relationship between γ 8 p and the number of stress cycles is determined based on the test results with different combinations of the octahedral average shear stress ratio τ 8 a τ 8 f and the octahedral cyclic shear stress ratio τ 8 c y τ 8 f τ 8 f is the octahedral shear stress at failure the relationship can be expressed as eq 9 the undetermined parameters c and d in eq 9 are expressed as functions of τ 8 a τ 8 f and τ 8 c y τ 8 f and d γ 8 p is obtained based on eq 9 as expressed in eq 10 9 γ 8 p c n d 10 d γ 8 p c d n d 1 where c 0 031 e τ 8 a τ 8 f 0 165 1 296 τ 8 c y τ 8 f d 9 34 e 3 e τ 8 a τ 8 f 0 145 1 321 τ 8 c y τ 8 f and n is the number of stress cycles parameter μ 0 is determined using a series of the trial and error calculations cheng and wang 2016 as shown in eq 11 the assumed μ 0 value associated with the specified τ 8 a τ 8 f and τ 8 c y τ 8 f is correct when the model predicted results agree with the test results of the relationship between γ 8 p and n 11 μ 0 99 84 3 26874 e 4 τ 8 c y τ 8 f 0 3 τ 8 a τ 8 f 3 3 analysis steps the deformation process of suction anchors subjected to combined static and cyclic loads was analysed according to two steps as follows 1 the static load f a was applied to the anchors the perfect elastoplastic model with the mises yield criterion was used during calculations the elastic modulus of soft clays was taken as 150 times the undrained shear strength s u poisson s ratio was 0 49 the octahedral average shear stress ratio τ 8 a τ 8 f of each soil element was determined based on the calculation results 2 a sinusoidal constant amplitude cyclic loading packet with the peak value of f cy was applied to the anchor along the direction of the static load for simulations of constant amplitude cyclic loading tests three sinusoidal constant amplitude cyclic loading packets with the peak value of f cy1 f cy2 and f cy3 were applied to the anchors in turn for simulations of variable amplitude cyclic loading tests the cyclic loads were divided into a series of incremental load steps and the deformation of the suction anchor was calculated using the finite element method by calling the subroutine umat for the constitutive model proposed by the authors based on these model parameters in section 3 2 2 the octahedral cyclic shear stress ratio τ 8 c y τ 8 f of each soil element was determined based on the calculation results of each loading cycle in addition the number of stress cycles n was assumed as the number of load cycles applied to the anchor then the model parameters were updated according to the calculated τ 8 a τ 8 f τ 8 c y τ 8 f and n based on eqs 10 and 11 it should be pointed out that the previous cyclic loading history has a significant effect on the deformation produced by subsequent loading for multistage cyclic loading tests the concept equivalent number of load cycles andersen et al 1996 kaggwa et al 1991 should be used in the research to consider the effects of the previous cyclic loading history and the current load level on subsequent deformation of soils according to the concept the equivalent number of load cycles means the number of cycles at loading level of a new load packet that would produce the same permanent deformation or permanent pore pressure as that produced by all previous cyclic loading thus the number of load cycles at the beginning of a new load packet should be equal to the equivalent number of load cycles of the previous load packet however during the finite element calculation in this study the constitutive model proposed by the authors has some difficulty in considering the effect of the irregular loading stress history the umat subroutine is unable to calculate the equivalent number of stress cycles of the previous load packet and then update the number of stress cycles at the beginning of a new load packet thus the number of load cycles at the beginning of a new load packet is tentatively assumed to be equal to the number of load cycles at the end of the previous load packet with ignoring the impact of previous irregular stress time history when simulating variable amplitude cyclic loading tests in this study the solution to this limitation will be further elaborated in later research work 4 comparisons of predictions and model test results 4 1 simulation for constant amplitude cyclic loading tests the typical test result and prediction for the anchor at failure are shown in fig 13 a and b respectively the translational motion of the anchor occurs and the horizontal cumulative displacement is greater than the vertical cumulative displacement in fig 13 b the separation occurs between the outer wall of anchor and the soils in the active regions meanwhile the soils are compressed and uplifted in the passive regions these predictions are consistant with the test results fig 14 shows the comparisons of predicted and measured displacement time curves along the mooring direction at the mooring point the predicted results show that the displacements increase rapidly at the beginning of cyclic loading and then the increasing rate gradually decreases as the number of load cycles increases the predictions are generally in agreement with test results however it is seen that the calculated rate of cumulative displacement at the beginning of the tests is larger than the measured rate the reason may be that the constitutive model used in numerical analysis underestimated the cumulative shear strain in predicting the cyclic triaxial tests the calculated rate of γ 8 p in eq 9 for many soil elements around the anchor at the beginning of cyclic loading is larger than the test results as shown in fig 15 which may result that the calculated rate of cumulative displacement of anchor at the beginning of the model tests is larger than the measured rate the cyclic bearing capacity can be predicted based on an appropriate failure criterion of displacement after obtaining the displacement time curves the failure criterion is 0 5 times the diameter of the anchor which is determined based on the monotonic loading tests it is assumed that the failure criterion is suitable to the anchor under average static and cyclic loads when the failure mode is the same as that under monotonic loads because the average and cyclic loads will result in static and cyclic cumulative displacements of suction anchor failure occurs when the sum of static and cyclic cumulative displacements reaches the failure criterion the cyclic bearing capacity and the number of cycles to failure are predicted according to the failure criterion for constant amplitude cyclic loading tests the test results and predictions of the number of load cycles to failure are denoted as n f and n f separately as shown in table 2 the maximum relative error between the predictions and test results is less than 10 the cyclic bearing capacity f f c y associated with n f is determined based on f f c y f a f c y f the predictions and test results of f f c y f f versus n f are shown in fig 16 they can be fitted using the same straight line in semi logarithm coordinate which indicates the predictions have good agreements with test results so the cyclic bearing capacity can also be well predicted using the finite element method 4 2 simulation for variable amplitude cyclic loading tests the test results and predictions of model test numbered as t5 at the end of every stages are shown in fig 17 the predictions show that the translational motion occurs for the anchor under cyclic loads and the cyclic cumulative displacement increases gradually as the cyclic load level increases the large cumulative displacement occurs for the anchor in both horizontal and vertical directions when the failure occurs at the end of the third stage the predicted results are generally in agreement with the test results in every stages however the cracking of soils in passive regions cannot be captured using the finite element method fig 18 shows a comparison of the predicted and measured displacement time curves along the mooring direction at the mooring point the predicted results show that the cyclic cumulative displacement and cyclic displacement increase with the increase of cyclic load level when the static load level keeps constant for each test the displacements increase rapidly during initial cyclic loading and then the increasing rate gradually decreases as the number of load cycles increases in every stages as mentioned in the simulation for constant amplitude cyclic loading tests because of the limitation of the constitutive model to fit the cyclic triaxial tests the calculated rate of cumulative displacement of anchor at the beginning of every stages is larger than the measured rate as a result the predictions and test results have some difference in every stages and even relatively large difference in some stage as shown in the figures besides the cracking of soils in passive regions and the accumulation of pore pressure cannot be captured by using the finite element method which will also cause the deviations between the predicted and tested results however the predicted results are basically in agreement with test results despite some deviations the predicted load displacement curve along the mooring direction at the mooring point for test t5 is shown in fig 19 the predicted hysteresis loops reveal the nonlinear responses of the foundation and the nonlinear responses become more significant as the cyclic load level increases the predictions are in good agreement with the test results as shown in fig 9 a which indicates that the load displacement responses of anchor under cyclic loads in soft clays can be simulated by the finite element method the comparisons of predicted and measured results for the horizontal and vertical cyclic cumulative displacements at the mooring point are shown in fig 20 the symbols and lines denote the test results and predicted results separately the predicted vertical cumulative displacements are much larger than the horizontal cumulative displacements which are consistent with the test results the predictions basically agree with the test results of the cyclic cumulative displacements in two directions despite some deviations 5 conclusions the cyclic deformation process of suction anchor subjected to the combined static and cyclic loads are investigated by conducting model tests then the cyclic behaviors of suction anchor in soft clays are simulated using the finite element method the key conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the displacement time curves along the mooring direction vertical and horizontal directions at the mooring point are obtained by performing constant and variable amplitude cyclic loading tests test results show that the cyclic cumulative displacement is larger than cyclic displacement in every direction and too large cyclic cumulative displacement is the main reason that leads to the failure of anchor the cyclic cumulative displacement is larger in horizontal than vertical direction and the horizontal failure mode of anchor tends to occur for constant amplitude tests because additional vertical weight is applied to the top of anchor to increase the vertical ultimate uplift capacity and that is really just the opposite for variable amplitude tests without additional vertical weight the higher the cyclic load level the less the number of cycles to failure for constant amplitude tests the cyclic cumulative displacement and cyclic displacement increase with the increase of cyclic load level when the static load level keeps constant for each variable amplitude test in addition the previous cyclic loading history has a significant effect on the deformation produced by subsequent loading 2 the cyclic displacement time history of the suction anchor under constant or variable amplitude cyclic loads can be predicted by the finite element analysis however because of the limitation of the constitutive model to fit the cyclic triaxial tests the calculated rate of cumulative displacement at the beginning of the tests is larger than the measured rate as a result the predictions and test results have some difference besides the cracking of soils in passive regions and the accumulation of pore pressure cannot be captured by using the finite element method which will also cause the deviations however the predicted results are basically in agreement with test results despite some deviations the failure modes of anchor can be predicted well because the predicted displacement components along vertical and horizontal directions are consistent with the experimental results on the trend the significant nonlinear responses of the foundation at different cyclic load levels can be revealed by the predicted hysteresis loops obviously the failure mechanism and failure modes of the suction anchors in soft clays can be well understood by analysing the cyclic deformation process 3 the cyclic bearing capacity can be determined according to appropriate displacement failure criterion after obtaining the cyclic displacement time history of the suction anchor the maximum relative error between the predictions and test results for logarithm of the number of load cycles to failure is less than 10 the predictions and test results of cyclic bearing capacity versus the number of cycles to failure meet the same linear relationship in semi logarithmic coordinate which indicates the cyclic bearing capacity can be predicted well by the finite element analysis though the cyclic behaviors of reduced scale suction anchor in soft clays are simulated well using the finite element method in this study the applicability of the numerical method to real offshore conditions should be further validated by simulating prototype tests or centrifuge model tests of suction anchor in future work acknowledgements financial support from the national natural science foundation of china grant no

23613,in order to cope with design difficulties of the mooring system of the floating wave energy converter wec in ultra shallow water under typhoon sea state while remaining economically feasible and reliable new mooring system design strategies need to be implemented the present paper aims at summarizing these design strategies of mooring system and proposing a novel mixed superflex wire rope design for wec mooring system by comparing with the traditional low elastic polyester ropes and hybrid catenary chain mooring system it has been found that adding high elastic cable such as superflex rope and buoy can effectively improve the reliability of the mooring system and the energy storage of the wec the numerical model demonstrated a good reliable and effective agreement with the experiment with the present superflex design the present mixed superflex rope mooring system can effectively reduce the mooring radius the length of mooring line and material usage as well as max mooring tension thanks to the good elasticity of the mooring system the transient extreme mooring tension can be effectively reduced and the survivability of the device can be improved this experience proposes significant improvements for other mooring system design of floating wec design in ultra shallow water keywords floating wave energy converter flex mooring system ultra shallow water superflex rope 1 introduction in the context of offshore wave energy exploitation near south china sea islands adopting the conventional low elasticity material for floating wave energy converter wec mooring in ultra shallow water generates design constraints that cannot be solved successfully on both economical and technical point of view the survivability of a wave energy device depend on the structural integrity of the mooring system impacting by 5 of the estimated cost of energy generation harnois et al 2015 and thus the global costs for a wec farm carbon and black 2001 for free floating systems the primary function of the mooring is the station keeping of the wec even in the most severe storm conditions failure of the mooring system even partial may lead to the loss of the device the mooring system of floating wecs design often based on offshore floating oil and gas platforms such as fpso mooring arrangements and installations standards while similarities exist between the mooring arrangements for floating wecs and oil platforms the design of a wec mooring system is facing some critical additional requirements and constraints first the suitable locations for wec installation are regions with relatively high wave energy density often coupled significant tidal flows unfavourable current loads may cause the misalignment of the device relative to the incoming waves leading to a reduction in energy extraction and an increase in structural loads as a consequence the tidal flows need careful consideration in the early stage of the design to achieve a suitable mooring arrangement second because of wecs that are not of the weathervaning bodies the relative motion between the different bodies parts under wave loads allowing power generation will depend on the mooring system behavior johanning et al 2007 third effective installation of wec farms in most locations would require a dense arrangement of converters to provide efficient and economical exploitation with a minimum of electrical hook up connection lengths and environmental impact thus the allowable horizontal motion excursions of devices from their equilibrium positions must be restricted to avoid collision moreover the footprint area covered by the mooring arrangement for each device has to remain small in order to avoid the potential clashing of mooring lines from different devices this is in contrast to typical offshore oil and gas installations where the footprint area is generally not restricted and the maximum allowable excursion is only defined by the allowable oil and gas risers constraints harris et al 2007 in shallow water under typhoon and other extreme sea the wec will suffer significantly heeling angle due to large transient mooring line tension this increases the probability of snatch loads when the ratio between the horizontal motions of the floating body and the water depth is large in the present case the water depth is 28 m the significant wave height is 9 07 m while the device operational draft is 14 m these healing angles not only reduce the wave energy capture efficiency but also increase the risk of overturning of the device impacting its survivability retzler 2006 retzler 2006 and fonseca et al 2008 fonseca et al 2008 2009 have already shown the effect of the absorbed wave power on drift forces on pelamis and flow wecs the extraction of energy significantly increases the horizontal drift forces this increases loadings on the mooring system and the device structure imposing additional design constraints the cost of the system will be directly related to this requirement some research work has been carried out over the last years fitzgerald and bergdahl 2008 fitzgerald and bergdahl 2008 concluded that the use of synthetic cables with low elasticity has the potential to greatly reduce the overall weight of the system the present work proposes a new design of spread mooring system introducing superflex fiber ropes within mooring lines increasing weathervaning performance of the wec and thus wave energy capture efficiency in ultra shallow water even in most severe storm conditions this design is developed for 100 kw sharp eagle wec sheng et al 2014 as shown in fig 1 the mooring system is composed of three hybrid mooring lines each line with a segment of superflex ropes connected to a surface buoy and attached to the anchor through a clumped chain segment the floating wec is connected to the buoys by a segment of chain the superflex rope whose strain can reach 60 70 provides smaller stiffness larger ductility and breaking strength than conventional fiber ropes reducing thus mooring lines tension the floating body hydrodynamic behavior has been evaluated using hydrostar based on frequency domain potential theory the mooring system behavior has been simulated in static and dynamic time domain using ariane7 mooring design code considering 50 year return period typhoon conditions and environmental conditions leading to maximum tensions comparisons have been made between the present superflex rope mooring system and traditional low elastic polyester ropes and hybrid catenary chain mooring system model tests were carried out for sharp eagle wec for the evaluation of mooring system coupled motion providing static tests and decay tests results as well as white noise rao tests and irregular tests discussion will be given about the effectiveness of the new design by comparing the numerical results with experimental data 2 operation principle of sharp eagle wec sharp eagle wec consists of four parts respectively with different functions see fig 1 a semi submersible floating structure serves both as carrier of the floating wec and damper which can minimize movements along with the waves the wave energy absorption system is composed of four wave absorbing floaters interacting with waves in order to convert wave energy into mechanical energy wave absorbing floaters shaped like an eagle head provides a very sensitive reaction to waves motions the energy conversion system converts the mechanical energy of the floaters into hydraulic energy accumulated into stable pressure cycles that are converted in electrical energy the fourth part is the mooring system which connects the floating device to the seabed anchors to prevent the device from drifting out of the operational areas under to winds waves or currents loads the main characteristics of the sharp eagle device are presented in table 1 the energy conversion processes of device are described in fig 2 due to the periodic excitation force of the wave the wave absorbing floats rotates around the hinge meanwhile the hydraulic cylinders installed between the wave absorbing floaters and the semi submersible structure are accordingly activated the energy conversion process can thus be summarized as wave energy mechanical energy hydraulic energy electrical energy the energy accumulators inside the wec accumulate energy also allows to stabilize the pressure thus while the initial input wave energy is highly unstable relatively stable electricity can be output in rear end in this sense power generating quality can be significantly improved by employing the pto scheme raised jia et al 2015 3 numerical methodology the method of design in terms of ultimate limit state follows four steps 1 calculate the hydrodynamic coefficients 1st order and 2nd order wave force and motion raos of the floating wec 2 characterize the environmental conditions in the ocean area where the prototype will be installed including waves wind and current 3 analyse the different parameters combination of the mooring system through static analyses optimization of the mooring system parameters evaluation of maximum expected mooring lines loads for further dynamic analyses 4 combine the loads induced by waves wind and currents and obtain the expected maximum values decomposed as static and dynamic loads and verify if the design loads weighted by the appropriate safety factors are smaller than the minimum break load mbl of the mooring lines 3 1 definition of the coordinate system two cartesian co ordinate systems are defined one c n e z is fixed in space c n is positive northward and c n e is in the plane of the still water level another o x y z is fixed on the floating body ox is positive forward when the floating body are at rest the c n c e and o x o y coincides between them and the origins c and o are at the center of the undisturbed free surface and the center line of the body in the plane of the keel respectively the directions of the axes are shown in fig 3 the position of the body in the fixed axis system is identified by x o y o z o of the origin o and by the heading of the vessel α the wave current and wind incidences are identified by the angles β w a v β c n t and β w i d respectively indicating the directions they come from relative to the fixed c n axis the mooring line is identified by the coordinates of its anchoring point in the fixed axis system and by its azimuth 3 2 mathematical formulations based on the wave diffraction radiation theory the hydrodynamic coefficients first order wave force and second order mean force are calculated the response amplitude operators raos for the motion of the wec are obtained by solving the frequency domain motion equation in terms of the wave spectrum the time series of wave force can be obtained by fast fourier transform algorithm furthermore the time series for six degree motion of the hull is solved from the time domain motion equation the motion equation of time domain coupling analysis is expressed as bellow 1 m μ x t h t τ x d t c x f 1 f 2 f m o o r f w f c where m represents a mass and inertia matrix of the hull μ denotes an added mass matrix λ stands for a radiation damping c is a hydrostatic stiffness matrix and f 1 represents a vector of first wave force x x and x are the displacement velocity and acceleration vectors respectively μ denotes the added mass matrix f 2 stands for the second order mean force which is calculated by far field formulation f m o o r represents the mooring load which is computed by finite element method h t τ is the retardation function which can be obtained by the convolution of the added mass and damping wei et al 2012 according to the definition of the aerodynamic coefficients in three directions the resultant wind f w and current force f c acting on a moored body are calculated using the equations ocimf 1994 3 f w 1 2 ρ a i r s t c w v w 2 f c 1 2 ρ ω l b p t d c c v c 2 where s t is the wind area t d is the average vessel draft l b p is the length between perpendiculars ρ a i r and ρ ω are the density in air and sea water v w and v c are the wind velocity at 10 m elevation and equivalent current velocity c w and c c are the aerodynamic and current coefficient respectively the low frequency wave loads which are supported by the mooring system have to be estimated these loads are usually estimated using one of the three well established methods the near field far field and middle field solutions dai et al 2005 the third method is simpler and needs the first order wave field on the control surface and has the same virtue as the middle field formulation to have rapid numerical convergence for horizontal drift loads in this work this has been used middle field results and newman s approximation allow one to calculate the mean drift force and the drift force spectrum as shown in eq 2 bv 2010 2 f k 2 ω 2 ω 2 q t f k α ω ω s ω d ω s f k 8 ω 2 ω 2 q t f k α ω ω μ 2 s ω s ω μ d ω with α α w ψ the relative wave incidence angle α w defined as the representative angle where waves come from q t f k α ω ω is the quadratic transfer function for motion k in regular waves with incidence α without slow drift motion while q t f k α ω ω μ is calculated according to newman s approximation the slow and mean drift forces including wave drift damping only for surge and sway whilst the yaw moment equation is identical but no damping correction is applied in survival environment conditions the wave energy absorbed by the buoys are in a fixed position to security considerations thus in hydrodynamic calculation the relative motions between the wave energy absorbed by buoys and supporting platform modified by semi submersible barge are not considered see fig 4 the main characteristics of the sharp eagle device are presented in table 1 although the total mass is large a large proportion of it is liquid ballast is necessary to achieve the design draft and inertial properties the draft is 14 m while the water depth is 15 m therefore most of the device is submerged this characteristic limits the wave forces in extreme conditions since the largest crests will run over the whole device 4 design requirement and strategy 4 1 environmental conditions the survival environment conditions are based on extreme waves wind and the corresponding currents respectively established in 50 years and 10 years return period of the sea states the water depth is 28 m and the design mooring radius will be less than 100 m the main design parameters are shown in table 2 which measured in china southern sea for real sea test where the wind speed is 1 h mean wind velocity at 10 m height jonswap spectrum is used for the wave spectrum 4 2 design strategy the main purpose of mooring system is to restrict the drift of device within the designed radius in the survival and operation sea states in order to achieve this goal the strength of mooring line in the specified conditions should be in accordance with industrial standards and some requirements in shallow water 1 to ensure high wave energy capture efficiency the mooring system should make device as forward as possible facing the wave direction and not to cover incident waves 2 the floating condition of device is to be changed in the combined action of waves currents wind and different sea level both the mooring system and device should not lead to great stress to survival in typhoon and other bad sea states thus the mooring system should have enough energy storages to buffer large transient wave loads rather than resist them by using strong stiffness of mooring lines 3 for requirements of economy and mooring area restriction the smaller ultimate tension shorter length smaller drift range and lower usage of materials of mooring lines are necessary 4 it is suitable for mooring system design of general wave energy devices the conventional lines made of chains and other low elastic polymeric ropes have several advantages however the disadvantages which are large weight and long length of the system in shallow water are difficult to overcome fonseca et al 2009 in order to increase reserve mooring forces catenary effects are not obvious in shallow water they need very long length of chains or ropes lying on the floor of the sea moreover when the water depth becomes very shallow the chain mooring system will fail in any case to provide sufficient restoring force through catenary effects for these reasons the option of superflex rope has been considered here 4 3 superflex rope superflex rope is a kind of artificial synthetic rope light and enables very high elasticity as shown in fig 5 mooring line can be partial adopts it therefore the resulting mooring system may possess enough reserve mooring forces each rope is composed of several yarns with a minimum break load mbl of 1 225 ton each the elastic modulus of superflex rope is much smaller than of the chain or wire rope thus high elastic segment of mooring line can effectively absorbs the kinetic energy of floating body and reduces the extreme loads of mooring system it is worth noting that the superflex rope has the plastic and nonlinear material property as shown in fig 5 however the numerical analysis tool ariane7 is not to be capable of applying in this property the superflex rope has to be simplified by linear fitting its stiffness to look like a series of conventional springs in below numerical study the stiffness of those springs are ea 3539n and ea 26194n respectively 5 numerical simulation 5 1 scheme design and optimization of a mixed supflex rope mooring system the wec will be moored by a spread flex mooring with weathervane and hardly to reduce wave energy capture efficiency in ultra shallow water the design process of the mooring lines is iterative in quasi static analysis during the early stage of design of the mooring several configurations were tested as well as different the numbers lengths and locations for the superflex ropes in table 3 leading to an optimized mixed superflex mooring system as in table 4 the mooring system is composed by three hybrid lines two towards the mean wave direction and one in the lee see for fig 6 each hybrid mooring line is composed by upper chain attaching to the floating wec and buoy is to avoid collision between them superflex ropes attach to the buoy and clump chain the elasticity of the mooring system is almost given by them for this reason there is no need or benefit from increasing the length of the chain segment clump chain attaching to the superflex ropes and bottom chain is to avoid anchor lift resist the tension of buoy and increases reserve mooring force bottom chain with a series of heavy blocks which attaches to the anchor in contact to the sea bottom is to prevent anchor lift one buoy with enough excess buoyancy connected to superflex ropes to make sure it stays above the sea bottom when tensioned the dynamic loads and responses are calculated for the extreme environmental condition shown in table 2 the worst incident angle of the environmental loads is considered namely an angle of 45 with the mooring system configuration which assumed wave wind and current all acting in the same direction this means that the loads are aligned with one of the lines the detailed characters of mooring lines are shown in table 4 corresponding to anchor positions of 96 5 85 1 28 96 5 85 1 28 and 137 5 0 28 m it can be seen in table 5 the maximum tensions of the mooring lines on top position fairlead point are 289 5 ton the safety factor is 1 67 for chain according to the api specification and 1 0 for superflex ropes the latter smaller safety factor is justified in this case for the reasons that the failure probability of single cable of superflex rope is very small the failure resulting economic loss is less than increased redundancy cost and is unlikely to lead to unacceptable consequences increasing the safety factor on superflex fiber rope segment for instance by increasing the size of the superflex ropes will be investigated in the future the anchor lift forces are all very small or zero due to bottom chain with a series of heavy blocks weighted 1325 kg m wet weight the bottom chain does not contact off the seabed even in the extreme condition by using drag embedment anchor thus the present mooring case meets the safety requirements of the mooring system in addition the heading direction of the sharp eagle wec is dominated by the direction of current weathervane in the eagle wec is critical to take the power of wave energy the weathervaning ability of this spread mooring system in different attack direction of wave and current are shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the eagle wec can also absorb tilted direction waves when wave and current form different angle due to a certain angle restriction of the weathervane of mooring system especially the sharp eagle wec is installed four floating buoys which make it can absorb different direction waves 5 2 investigation of elastic effects of mooring line materials in order to study the influence of mooring line elasticity on the mooring force and displacement of the wec in shallow water the polyester rope and chain respectively are used instead of the superflex rope as shown in figs 8 and 9 the configurations of the mixed polyester mooring system and catenary chain mooring system and corresponding tensions of mooring line 2 and the displacements of the wec are shown in table 6 from the tables 5 and 6 it is observed that the length of superflex rope is very shorter than conventional material for application of 250 m length of low elastic polymeric rope and 630 m length and 80 mm diameter of chain the application of superflex rope can not only reduces the usage of common chain but also effectively reduces the length of mooring line or mooring area radius which is more suitable for wec s mooring in shallow water the reasonable high elastic cables and buoys play a good role in the energy storage of mooring system the tensions of mooring line of the wec can be effectively reduced the advantage of the hybrid design with superflex ropes compared to catenary chain lines is the final weight of the mooring system in fact due to shallow water mooring characteristics the chain lines easily become taut and when this happens the elastic region is reached making tension increase very much for small additional horizontal displacements of the floating body this means that chain lines are not good for absorbing these dynamic loads induced by the waves for this reason just for the sake of inducing catenary response and not for strength the resulting design would necessarily consist on large diameter chains however superflex rope are easily capable of additional enough elastic strain even when the lines are taut therefore they have good elastic reserve to absorb wave induced wave frequency motions of the floater it can be effectively shorter mooring line and reduce mooring zone by compare with conventional lines made of chain or low elasticity materials such as nylon and polyester rope as the weathervaning of the sharp eagle wec is critical to absorb of wave energy the axial stiffness of first mooring lines line 1 and line 2 are bigger than last line 3 6 experimental procedure 6 1 experimental set up to validate the numerical design and assumption presented earlier in this paper wind wave current model tests are done in an offshore wave basin the basin size is 50 m long 30 m wide thanks to a false bottom the water depth can be varied from near 0 up to 6 m during the experiments it was set at 0 667 m the scale is 1 42 only froude number and strouhal number of experiment model are equal with full scale wec sheng et al 2010 the objective of the model test is to measure the mooring line tension and the response of 6 degrees freedom motion of wec in condition of dynamic position the horizontal motions of the wec model are constrained by three mooring lines which are made of chains and springs as shown in fig 10 similar to numerical study the surperflex ropes are replaced by o ring springs which are used to model the axial stiffness the combined rope has an overall axial stiffness close to the scaled down axial stiffness collocation and position of system also agreed with present numerical design instrumentation consists in the optical tracking ntsm non contact type six component motion system giving the 6 degrees motion with a very high accuracy the mooring system is tracked optically with two fixed video cameras respectively set above and below the surface of the water the mooring line tensions at fairlead point are measured through a combination of one force sensors the tests are run in irregular waves at 0 45 and 90 heading the spectrum is of jonswap type with γ 1 336 peak periods t p of 2 21 s and the corresponding significant wave height h s value is 0 219 m the test duration is 3 h and the sampling rate is 50 hz steady wind and current is respectively simulated by average wind speed 6 28 m s for 1 h and surface velocity 0 17 m s for loads combination it is assumed that the extreme environmental loads all act in the same direction 6 2 environmental loads correction and mooring stiffness verification a significant amount of environmental loads measurement work is done in the following areas in order to get confident and accurate experimental validation activities included decay tests are carried out to evaluate the viscous damping of the wec non dimensional viscous damping coefficients d ξ and natural period t n measured by free decay motion of the model the viscous damping d in numerical is given by d d ξ d c d c 2 m 2 π t where m m m a m and m a is respectively the mass and nature frequency added mass of floating body d c is the critical damping measurement of current forces properties including surge and sway current forces f c i current speed v c and average yaw the corresponding surge and sway current coefficient c c i with i 0 30 90 for different heading are given by c c i f c i v c 2 confirmation of wave elevation time series repeatability thus the full scale environmental conditions corrected by experiments are obtained tables 7 and 8 as the parameters of the storms are h s 8 77 m and t z 13 49 m quasi static tests are used to identify the horizontal stiffness characteristics of the mooring system by determining the relationship between the wec horizontal position and the mooring line tensions the results of the experimental and numerical model show an excellent agreement and the relative error not exceeding 4 fig 11 7 experimental validation and discussions 7 1 analysis of wec s motion raos in frequency domain wec motions raos in each freedom degree are evaluated by white noise tests the comparisons between numerical and experimental results are presented the heave and roll raos obtained by initial numerical model are largely overestimated by comparing with experiments around the resonant period 25 19s and 17 3s fig 12 b f g the high values in numerical model are due to the lack of damping in heave and roll with viscous damping forces underestimated in the previous hydrodynamic calculation of wec motion raos thus the numerical calculations are carried out again in frequency domain by using the viscous damping measured in the test as shown in table 7 it can be seen that a very good agreement in a large wave period range about 5s 17 5s is achieved for wec motion raos between white noise tests and numerical simulations while the viscous damping are considered the difference is observed for higher periods accuracy of the experimental data can be questioned for wave period evaluation other model instabilities occurring and that these periods are of lesser interest for the design lower wave energy at these periods in the considered storms this seems particularly true for surge and pitch data while roll and heave seems more stable the pattern of rao for surge and pitch at high wave periods are characteristics of such instabilities and are maybe within the limits of white noise methods this is due to a small correlation coefficient in cross spectrum analysis procedure of white noise tests in higher periods a small correlation coefficient cannot be better to reflect the relationship between input and output data and precision of experimental results suffer correspondingly yang et al 2008 of the wave frequency motions of wec the contribution from the first order wave excitation forces are overwhelming compared with the small effect of the present flex mooring system the reason is that the wave period of the jonswap wave spectrum are all less than 25s but the natural period of the mooring system in horizontal plane motions are respectively 109s and 141 7s which are much more than 25s those show the present flex mooring system doesn t influence wave energy absorbing of wec it is noteworthy that the natural periods of wec are all more than wave spectral peak period 13 5s the sharp eagle wec has superior motion and stability properties 7 2 analysis of tensions of mooring lines and displacements of wec in time domain the wec mooring time domain coupled analysis of wec is carried out and the environmental loads such as viscous damping and current forces coefficients are corrected by experiments tables 7 and 8 time series response spectrum and statistics for 6 dof motions of the hull and tensions of mooring lines are obtained numerical results are compared with the results of irregular wave tests fig 13 and fig 15 depict the time series for the motions of wec hull and tensions of mooring lines in order to exhibit the details of motion and tension responses the time plots are selected from 5500s to 6000s the response spectrums for them are described in fig 16 the statistics are tabulated in tables 9 and 10 the comparison between the numerical and the experimental results shows that the numerical results mostly agree well with the experimental data but there are also differences which can not be ignored in figs 13 and 15 the reason is that the numerical method based on linear potential flow theory fails to incorporate the strong nonlinearities of steep or breaking waves in shallow water and wec motions with large amplitudes in present survival sea state wei 2017 and the draft of sharp eagle wec is 14 m its water plane is very small and the major structure changes very sharply near the waterline when the wec has large heave and pitch amplitude without the consideration of nonlinear factors due to the instantaneous position variation of body surface the nonlinear wave loads wec motion especially heave and pitch with large amplitude are impossible to be accurately predicted in numerical simulation based on linear potential theory experiments are showing for pitch low frequency energy these low frequency energies are lower than pitch natural period that is because of pitch is coupled with heave motion so it would need a finer model to be addressed in numerical modeling the mooring tensions of the superflex mooring system have slower change rates and more uniform than that of the mixed chain mooring system as shown in figs 13d and 14 because the superflex mooring system has enough elastic energy storage and the slope of the mooring stiffness curve is smaller it can be effective to reduce the maximum tensions of mooring lines and instantaneous increased tensions are avoided as much as possible the surge spectrum is a double peaked spectrum in fig 16a both in numerical simulation and experiments the peak periods for which are about 97 s and 13s respectively while the heave spectrum is a single peaked spectrum obtained by experiments the peak period for which is about 13s but a double peaked spectrum in numerical simulation the peak periods for which are about respectively 26s and 13s in fig 16b the pitch spectrum is also a double peaked spectrum obtained by experiments the peak periods for which are about respectively 39 25s and 13s but a single peaked spectrum obtained by numerical simulation the peak period for which is 39 25s in fig 16c for surge and pitch motion low frequency natural frequency and wave frequency motion are all obviously and half the weight of the two for heave motion wave frequency motion consists of the main part it shows that the superflex mooring system has good energy storage characteristics the low frequency drift and wave frequency motion of the device are all allowed so that the device can drift along with the waves within a wavelength range this contributes towards strengthening the overall system security by releasing the wave loads and decreasing the tensions of mooring lines the maximal motions for surge heave sway roll and pitch are 14 3 m 4 m 23 9m 3 8 and 14 7 in heading 45 respectively see table 10 the motions of wec are violent and green water will happen in extreme condition so the wec is not fit for operation in typhoon conditions only survivability need to be addressed as most of the device is submerged this characteristic limits the wave forces since the largest crests will run over the whole device further analysis shows that based on tables 9 and 10 in a heading 0 wave state the mooring line 1 and line 2 play major roles the experimental tensions of mooring line 1 and line 2 are not equal to each other it s due to the pretention of line 1and line 2 cannot be completely consistent resulting in asymmetric motion system in the experiment for stronger one in heading 45 the mooring line 1 plays a major role there is some difference between numerical and experimental results for the tensions of line 3 it can be observed that the numerical displacements of sway and yaw motions of the wec somewhat exceed the experimental ones the reason is that the frictional effects in longer bottom chains segment of line 3 and the bottom of wave basin are obvious in the experiment it s only need smaller displacements of the wec around the center of clump chain to provide adequate yaw righting moment and sway righting force however the frictional effects isn t considered in numerical calculation the larger displacements of the wec around the center of fairlead are required to provide adequate yaw righting moments and sway righting forces while in a heading 90 wave state the mooring line 1 and line 3 play major roles the numerical results and the experimental results of the tensions of mooring line 1 are in good agreement similar to heading 45 cases the frictional effects in longer bottom chains segment of line 3 and the bottom of wave basin brings on the error between the results obtained by numerical simulation and experiment the study of experiment demonstrates that the present flex mooring system can be effective to reduce the maxim tensions of mooring lines and calmly resist extreme storm states the elasticity of the mooring system is almost given by surperflex rope as shown in fig 17 thus there is no need or benefit to increase the length of the chain segment 8 conclusions based on these experimental and numerical evaluations catenary mooring systems may not be the best solution for the wec due to ultra shallow water and large drift loads especially in storm conditions with a spread mooring system using superflex rope allowing in some extent weathervaning of the unit the design presented in this paper offer enough reserve mooring strength to the system and meets the requirements of economy and mooring area restriction in ultra shallow water this system using superflex rope chain and buoy to establish a stiffness curve of the mooring line with small enough slope also allows to have a response more linear to environmental loading and avoids large mooring line tensions it is observed that only using as main part of the mooring system 12 6 m length of superflex ropes can meet design requirements the design water depth is 30 m and significant wave height is 9 07 m which is very shorter than conventional materials for application of 250 m length of low elastic polymeric rope or 630 m length and 80 mm diameter of chain the length and weight of the mooring line and mooring zone are obviously reduced by comparing with conventional mooring systems the hydrodynamic behavior of sharp eagle wec with present superflex rope mooring system in shallow water has been investigated by numerical method and model test demonstrating a good agreements and a reliability of the design for wec s surge and pitch motion low frequency natural frequency and wave frequency motion equivalently participating to the unit response while heave motion in mainly driven by wave frequency motion the mooring tension time history curves of the superflex mooring system have slower change rates and more uniform than that of the mixed chain mooring system because the superflex mooring system has enough elastic capacity and the slope of the mooring stiffness curve is smaller it can be effective to reduce the maxim transient tension of the mooring line and instantaneous increased tension are avoided as much as possible the present flex mooring system also doesn t influence wave energy absorption capacity of wec it is noteworthy that the natural periods of sharp eagle wec are far larger than the 50 years retrun period survival sea state wave peak period 14s providing to the sharp eagle wec very good stability see keeping and station keeping properties as the elasticity of the mooring system is almost given by the surperflex rope there is also no need or benefit from increasing the length of the chain segment superflex ropes are also providing additional elastic strain even when the lines are taut and therefore they have good elastic reserve to absorb wave induced forces all these characteristics are providing advantages for the use of superflex ropes for the mooring of wec devices in ultra shallow water based on a technically sound mooring system design the long term economic and environmental benefits of this alternative design are still to be evaluated in the real sea states the methodology presented in this paper can be used by wave energy

23613,in order to cope with design difficulties of the mooring system of the floating wave energy converter wec in ultra shallow water under typhoon sea state while remaining economically feasible and reliable new mooring system design strategies need to be implemented the present paper aims at summarizing these design strategies of mooring system and proposing a novel mixed superflex wire rope design for wec mooring system by comparing with the traditional low elastic polyester ropes and hybrid catenary chain mooring system it has been found that adding high elastic cable such as superflex rope and buoy can effectively improve the reliability of the mooring system and the energy storage of the wec the numerical model demonstrated a good reliable and effective agreement with the experiment with the present superflex design the present mixed superflex rope mooring system can effectively reduce the mooring radius the length of mooring line and material usage as well as max mooring tension thanks to the good elasticity of the mooring system the transient extreme mooring tension can be effectively reduced and the survivability of the device can be improved this experience proposes significant improvements for other mooring system design of floating wec design in ultra shallow water keywords floating wave energy converter flex mooring system ultra shallow water superflex rope 1 introduction in the context of offshore wave energy exploitation near south china sea islands adopting the conventional low elasticity material for floating wave energy converter wec mooring in ultra shallow water generates design constraints that cannot be solved successfully on both economical and technical point of view the survivability of a wave energy device depend on the structural integrity of the mooring system impacting by 5 of the estimated cost of energy generation harnois et al 2015 and thus the global costs for a wec farm carbon and black 2001 for free floating systems the primary function of the mooring is the station keeping of the wec even in the most severe storm conditions failure of the mooring system even partial may lead to the loss of the device the mooring system of floating wecs design often based on offshore floating oil and gas platforms such as fpso mooring arrangements and installations standards while similarities exist between the mooring arrangements for floating wecs and oil platforms the design of a wec mooring system is facing some critical additional requirements and constraints first the suitable locations for wec installation are regions with relatively high wave energy density often coupled significant tidal flows unfavourable current loads may cause the misalignment of the device relative to the incoming waves leading to a reduction in energy extraction and an increase in structural loads as a consequence the tidal flows need careful consideration in the early stage of the design to achieve a suitable mooring arrangement second because of wecs that are not of the weathervaning bodies the relative motion between the different bodies parts under wave loads allowing power generation will depend on the mooring system behavior johanning et al 2007 third effective installation of wec farms in most locations would require a dense arrangement of converters to provide efficient and economical exploitation with a minimum of electrical hook up connection lengths and environmental impact thus the allowable horizontal motion excursions of devices from their equilibrium positions must be restricted to avoid collision moreover the footprint area covered by the mooring arrangement for each device has to remain small in order to avoid the potential clashing of mooring lines from different devices this is in contrast to typical offshore oil and gas installations where the footprint area is generally not restricted and the maximum allowable excursion is only defined by the allowable oil and gas risers constraints harris et al 2007 in shallow water under typhoon and other extreme sea the wec will suffer significantly heeling angle due to large transient mooring line tension this increases the probability of snatch loads when the ratio between the horizontal motions of the floating body and the water depth is large in the present case the water depth is 28 m the significant wave height is 9 07 m while the device operational draft is 14 m these healing angles not only reduce the wave energy capture efficiency but also increase the risk of overturning of the device impacting its survivability retzler 2006 retzler 2006 and fonseca et al 2008 fonseca et al 2008 2009 have already shown the effect of the absorbed wave power on drift forces on pelamis and flow wecs the extraction of energy significantly increases the horizontal drift forces this increases loadings on the mooring system and the device structure imposing additional design constraints the cost of the system will be directly related to this requirement some research work has been carried out over the last years fitzgerald and bergdahl 2008 fitzgerald and bergdahl 2008 concluded that the use of synthetic cables with low elasticity has the potential to greatly reduce the overall weight of the system the present work proposes a new design of spread mooring system introducing superflex fiber ropes within mooring lines increasing weathervaning performance of the wec and thus wave energy capture efficiency in ultra shallow water even in most severe storm conditions this design is developed for 100 kw sharp eagle wec sheng et al 2014 as shown in fig 1 the mooring system is composed of three hybrid mooring lines each line with a segment of superflex ropes connected to a surface buoy and attached to the anchor through a clumped chain segment the floating wec is connected to the buoys by a segment of chain the superflex rope whose strain can reach 60 70 provides smaller stiffness larger ductility and breaking strength than conventional fiber ropes reducing thus mooring lines tension the floating body hydrodynamic behavior has been evaluated using hydrostar based on frequency domain potential theory the mooring system behavior has been simulated in static and dynamic time domain using ariane7 mooring design code considering 50 year return period typhoon conditions and environmental conditions leading to maximum tensions comparisons have been made between the present superflex rope mooring system and traditional low elastic polyester ropes and hybrid catenary chain mooring system model tests were carried out for sharp eagle wec for the evaluation of mooring system coupled motion providing static tests and decay tests results as well as white noise rao tests and irregular tests discussion will be given about the effectiveness of the new design by comparing the numerical results with experimental data 2 operation principle of sharp eagle wec sharp eagle wec consists of four parts respectively with different functions see fig 1 a semi submersible floating structure serves both as carrier of the floating wec and damper which can minimize movements along with the waves the wave energy absorption system is composed of four wave absorbing floaters interacting with waves in order to convert wave energy into mechanical energy wave absorbing floaters shaped like an eagle head provides a very sensitive reaction to waves motions the energy conversion system converts the mechanical energy of the floaters into hydraulic energy accumulated into stable pressure cycles that are converted in electrical energy the fourth part is the mooring system which connects the floating device to the seabed anchors to prevent the device from drifting out of the operational areas under to winds waves or currents loads the main characteristics of the sharp eagle device are presented in table 1 the energy conversion processes of device are described in fig 2 due to the periodic excitation force of the wave the wave absorbing floats rotates around the hinge meanwhile the hydraulic cylinders installed between the wave absorbing floaters and the semi submersible structure are accordingly activated the energy conversion process can thus be summarized as wave energy mechanical energy hydraulic energy electrical energy the energy accumulators inside the wec accumulate energy also allows to stabilize the pressure thus while the initial input wave energy is highly unstable relatively stable electricity can be output in rear end in this sense power generating quality can be significantly improved by employing the pto scheme raised jia et al 2015 3 numerical methodology the method of design in terms of ultimate limit state follows four steps 1 calculate the hydrodynamic coefficients 1st order and 2nd order wave force and motion raos of the floating wec 2 characterize the environmental conditions in the ocean area where the prototype will be installed including waves wind and current 3 analyse the different parameters combination of the mooring system through static analyses optimization of the mooring system parameters evaluation of maximum expected mooring lines loads for further dynamic analyses 4 combine the loads induced by waves wind and currents and obtain the expected maximum values decomposed as static and dynamic loads and verify if the design loads weighted by the appropriate safety factors are smaller than the minimum break load mbl of the mooring lines 3 1 definition of the coordinate system two cartesian co ordinate systems are defined one c n e z is fixed in space c n is positive northward and c n e is in the plane of the still water level another o x y z is fixed on the floating body ox is positive forward when the floating body are at rest the c n c e and o x o y coincides between them and the origins c and o are at the center of the undisturbed free surface and the center line of the body in the plane of the keel respectively the directions of the axes are shown in fig 3 the position of the body in the fixed axis system is identified by x o y o z o of the origin o and by the heading of the vessel α the wave current and wind incidences are identified by the angles β w a v β c n t and β w i d respectively indicating the directions they come from relative to the fixed c n axis the mooring line is identified by the coordinates of its anchoring point in the fixed axis system and by its azimuth 3 2 mathematical formulations based on the wave diffraction radiation theory the hydrodynamic coefficients first order wave force and second order mean force are calculated the response amplitude operators raos for the motion of the wec are obtained by solving the frequency domain motion equation in terms of the wave spectrum the time series of wave force can be obtained by fast fourier transform algorithm furthermore the time series for six degree motion of the hull is solved from the time domain motion equation the motion equation of time domain coupling analysis is expressed as bellow 1 m μ x t h t τ x d t c x f 1 f 2 f m o o r f w f c where m represents a mass and inertia matrix of the hull μ denotes an added mass matrix λ stands for a radiation damping c is a hydrostatic stiffness matrix and f 1 represents a vector of first wave force x x and x are the displacement velocity and acceleration vectors respectively μ denotes the added mass matrix f 2 stands for the second order mean force which is calculated by far field formulation f m o o r represents the mooring load which is computed by finite element method h t τ is the retardation function which can be obtained by the convolution of the added mass and damping wei et al 2012 according to the definition of the aerodynamic coefficients in three directions the resultant wind f w and current force f c acting on a moored body are calculated using the equations ocimf 1994 3 f w 1 2 ρ a i r s t c w v w 2 f c 1 2 ρ ω l b p t d c c v c 2 where s t is the wind area t d is the average vessel draft l b p is the length between perpendiculars ρ a i r and ρ ω are the density in air and sea water v w and v c are the wind velocity at 10 m elevation and equivalent current velocity c w and c c are the aerodynamic and current coefficient respectively the low frequency wave loads which are supported by the mooring system have to be estimated these loads are usually estimated using one of the three well established methods the near field far field and middle field solutions dai et al 2005 the third method is simpler and needs the first order wave field on the control surface and has the same virtue as the middle field formulation to have rapid numerical convergence for horizontal drift loads in this work this has been used middle field results and newman s approximation allow one to calculate the mean drift force and the drift force spectrum as shown in eq 2 bv 2010 2 f k 2 ω 2 ω 2 q t f k α ω ω s ω d ω s f k 8 ω 2 ω 2 q t f k α ω ω μ 2 s ω s ω μ d ω with α α w ψ the relative wave incidence angle α w defined as the representative angle where waves come from q t f k α ω ω is the quadratic transfer function for motion k in regular waves with incidence α without slow drift motion while q t f k α ω ω μ is calculated according to newman s approximation the slow and mean drift forces including wave drift damping only for surge and sway whilst the yaw moment equation is identical but no damping correction is applied in survival environment conditions the wave energy absorbed by the buoys are in a fixed position to security considerations thus in hydrodynamic calculation the relative motions between the wave energy absorbed by buoys and supporting platform modified by semi submersible barge are not considered see fig 4 the main characteristics of the sharp eagle device are presented in table 1 although the total mass is large a large proportion of it is liquid ballast is necessary to achieve the design draft and inertial properties the draft is 14 m while the water depth is 15 m therefore most of the device is submerged this characteristic limits the wave forces in extreme conditions since the largest crests will run over the whole device 4 design requirement and strategy 4 1 environmental conditions the survival environment conditions are based on extreme waves wind and the corresponding currents respectively established in 50 years and 10 years return period of the sea states the water depth is 28 m and the design mooring radius will be less than 100 m the main design parameters are shown in table 2 which measured in china southern sea for real sea test where the wind speed is 1 h mean wind velocity at 10 m height jonswap spectrum is used for the wave spectrum 4 2 design strategy the main purpose of mooring system is to restrict the drift of device within the designed radius in the survival and operation sea states in order to achieve this goal the strength of mooring line in the specified conditions should be in accordance with industrial standards and some requirements in shallow water 1 to ensure high wave energy capture efficiency the mooring system should make device as forward as possible facing the wave direction and not to cover incident waves 2 the floating condition of device is to be changed in the combined action of waves currents wind and different sea level both the mooring system and device should not lead to great stress to survival in typhoon and other bad sea states thus the mooring system should have enough energy storages to buffer large transient wave loads rather than resist them by using strong stiffness of mooring lines 3 for requirements of economy and mooring area restriction the smaller ultimate tension shorter length smaller drift range and lower usage of materials of mooring lines are necessary 4 it is suitable for mooring system design of general wave energy devices the conventional lines made of chains and other low elastic polymeric ropes have several advantages however the disadvantages which are large weight and long length of the system in shallow water are difficult to overcome fonseca et al 2009 in order to increase reserve mooring forces catenary effects are not obvious in shallow water they need very long length of chains or ropes lying on the floor of the sea moreover when the water depth becomes very shallow the chain mooring system will fail in any case to provide sufficient restoring force through catenary effects for these reasons the option of superflex rope has been considered here 4 3 superflex rope superflex rope is a kind of artificial synthetic rope light and enables very high elasticity as shown in fig 5 mooring line can be partial adopts it therefore the resulting mooring system may possess enough reserve mooring forces each rope is composed of several yarns with a minimum break load mbl of 1 225 ton each the elastic modulus of superflex rope is much smaller than of the chain or wire rope thus high elastic segment of mooring line can effectively absorbs the kinetic energy of floating body and reduces the extreme loads of mooring system it is worth noting that the superflex rope has the plastic and nonlinear material property as shown in fig 5 however the numerical analysis tool ariane7 is not to be capable of applying in this property the superflex rope has to be simplified by linear fitting its stiffness to look like a series of conventional springs in below numerical study the stiffness of those springs are ea 3539n and ea 26194n respectively 5 numerical simulation 5 1 scheme design and optimization of a mixed supflex rope mooring system the wec will be moored by a spread flex mooring with weathervane and hardly to reduce wave energy capture efficiency in ultra shallow water the design process of the mooring lines is iterative in quasi static analysis during the early stage of design of the mooring several configurations were tested as well as different the numbers lengths and locations for the superflex ropes in table 3 leading to an optimized mixed superflex mooring system as in table 4 the mooring system is composed by three hybrid lines two towards the mean wave direction and one in the lee see for fig 6 each hybrid mooring line is composed by upper chain attaching to the floating wec and buoy is to avoid collision between them superflex ropes attach to the buoy and clump chain the elasticity of the mooring system is almost given by them for this reason there is no need or benefit from increasing the length of the chain segment clump chain attaching to the superflex ropes and bottom chain is to avoid anchor lift resist the tension of buoy and increases reserve mooring force bottom chain with a series of heavy blocks which attaches to the anchor in contact to the sea bottom is to prevent anchor lift one buoy with enough excess buoyancy connected to superflex ropes to make sure it stays above the sea bottom when tensioned the dynamic loads and responses are calculated for the extreme environmental condition shown in table 2 the worst incident angle of the environmental loads is considered namely an angle of 45 with the mooring system configuration which assumed wave wind and current all acting in the same direction this means that the loads are aligned with one of the lines the detailed characters of mooring lines are shown in table 4 corresponding to anchor positions of 96 5 85 1 28 96 5 85 1 28 and 137 5 0 28 m it can be seen in table 5 the maximum tensions of the mooring lines on top position fairlead point are 289 5 ton the safety factor is 1 67 for chain according to the api specification and 1 0 for superflex ropes the latter smaller safety factor is justified in this case for the reasons that the failure probability of single cable of superflex rope is very small the failure resulting economic loss is less than increased redundancy cost and is unlikely to lead to unacceptable consequences increasing the safety factor on superflex fiber rope segment for instance by increasing the size of the superflex ropes will be investigated in the future the anchor lift forces are all very small or zero due to bottom chain with a series of heavy blocks weighted 1325 kg m wet weight the bottom chain does not contact off the seabed even in the extreme condition by using drag embedment anchor thus the present mooring case meets the safety requirements of the mooring system in addition the heading direction of the sharp eagle wec is dominated by the direction of current weathervane in the eagle wec is critical to take the power of wave energy the weathervaning ability of this spread mooring system in different attack direction of wave and current are shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the eagle wec can also absorb tilted direction waves when wave and current form different angle due to a certain angle restriction of the weathervane of mooring system especially the sharp eagle wec is installed four floating buoys which make it can absorb different direction waves 5 2 investigation of elastic effects of mooring line materials in order to study the influence of mooring line elasticity on the mooring force and displacement of the wec in shallow water the polyester rope and chain respectively are used instead of the superflex rope as shown in figs 8 and 9 the configurations of the mixed polyester mooring system and catenary chain mooring system and corresponding tensions of mooring line 2 and the displacements of the wec are shown in table 6 from the tables 5 and 6 it is observed that the length of superflex rope is very shorter than conventional material for application of 250 m length of low elastic polymeric rope and 630 m length and 80 mm diameter of chain the application of superflex rope can not only reduces the usage of common chain but also effectively reduces the length of mooring line or mooring area radius which is more suitable for wec s mooring in shallow water the reasonable high elastic cables and buoys play a good role in the energy storage of mooring system the tensions of mooring line of the wec can be effectively reduced the advantage of the hybrid design with superflex ropes compared to catenary chain lines is the final weight of the mooring system in fact due to shallow water mooring characteristics the chain lines easily become taut and when this happens the elastic region is reached making tension increase very much for small additional horizontal displacements of the floating body this means that chain lines are not good for absorbing these dynamic loads induced by the waves for this reason just for the sake of inducing catenary response and not for strength the resulting design would necessarily consist on large diameter chains however superflex rope are easily capable of additional enough elastic strain even when the lines are taut therefore they have good elastic reserve to absorb wave induced wave frequency motions of the floater it can be effectively shorter mooring line and reduce mooring zone by compare with conventional lines made of chain or low elasticity materials such as nylon and polyester rope as the weathervaning of the sharp eagle wec is critical to absorb of wave energy the axial stiffness of first mooring lines line 1 and line 2 are bigger than last line 3 6 experimental procedure 6 1 experimental set up to validate the numerical design and assumption presented earlier in this paper wind wave current model tests are done in an offshore wave basin the basin size is 50 m long 30 m wide thanks to a false bottom the water depth can be varied from near 0 up to 6 m during the experiments it was set at 0 667 m the scale is 1 42 only froude number and strouhal number of experiment model are equal with full scale wec sheng et al 2010 the objective of the model test is to measure the mooring line tension and the response of 6 degrees freedom motion of wec in condition of dynamic position the horizontal motions of the wec model are constrained by three mooring lines which are made of chains and springs as shown in fig 10 similar to numerical study the surperflex ropes are replaced by o ring springs which are used to model the axial stiffness the combined rope has an overall axial stiffness close to the scaled down axial stiffness collocation and position of system also agreed with present numerical design instrumentation consists in the optical tracking ntsm non contact type six component motion system giving the 6 degrees motion with a very high accuracy the mooring system is tracked optically with two fixed video cameras respectively set above and below the surface of the water the mooring line tensions at fairlead point are measured through a combination of one force sensors the tests are run in irregular waves at 0 45 and 90 heading the spectrum is of jonswap type with γ 1 336 peak periods t p of 2 21 s and the corresponding significant wave height h s value is 0 219 m the test duration is 3 h and the sampling rate is 50 hz steady wind and current is respectively simulated by average wind speed 6 28 m s for 1 h and surface velocity 0 17 m s for loads combination it is assumed that the extreme environmental loads all act in the same direction 6 2 environmental loads correction and mooring stiffness verification a significant amount of environmental loads measurement work is done in the following areas in order to get confident and accurate experimental validation activities included decay tests are carried out to evaluate the viscous damping of the wec non dimensional viscous damping coefficients d ξ and natural period t n measured by free decay motion of the model the viscous damping d in numerical is given by d d ξ d c d c 2 m 2 π t where m m m a m and m a is respectively the mass and nature frequency added mass of floating body d c is the critical damping measurement of current forces properties including surge and sway current forces f c i current speed v c and average yaw the corresponding surge and sway current coefficient c c i with i 0 30 90 for different heading are given by c c i f c i v c 2 confirmation of wave elevation time series repeatability thus the full scale environmental conditions corrected by experiments are obtained tables 7 and 8 as the parameters of the storms are h s 8 77 m and t z 13 49 m quasi static tests are used to identify the horizontal stiffness characteristics of the mooring system by determining the relationship between the wec horizontal position and the mooring line tensions the results of the experimental and numerical model show an excellent agreement and the relative error not exceeding 4 fig 11 7 experimental validation and discussions 7 1 analysis of wec s motion raos in frequency domain wec motions raos in each freedom degree are evaluated by white noise tests the comparisons between numerical and experimental results are presented the heave and roll raos obtained by initial numerical model are largely overestimated by comparing with experiments around the resonant period 25 19s and 17 3s fig 12 b f g the high values in numerical model are due to the lack of damping in heave and roll with viscous damping forces underestimated in the previous hydrodynamic calculation of wec motion raos thus the numerical calculations are carried out again in frequency domain by using the viscous damping measured in the test as shown in table 7 it can be seen that a very good agreement in a large wave period range about 5s 17 5s is achieved for wec motion raos between white noise tests and numerical simulations while the viscous damping are considered the difference is observed for higher periods accuracy of the experimental data can be questioned for wave period evaluation other model instabilities occurring and that these periods are of lesser interest for the design lower wave energy at these periods in the considered storms this seems particularly true for surge and pitch data while roll and heave seems more stable the pattern of rao for surge and pitch at high wave periods are characteristics of such instabilities and are maybe within the limits of white noise methods this is due to a small correlation coefficient in cross spectrum analysis procedure of white noise tests in higher periods a small correlation coefficient cannot be better to reflect the relationship between input and output data and precision of experimental results suffer correspondingly yang et al 2008 of the wave frequency motions of wec the contribution from the first order wave excitation forces are overwhelming compared with the small effect of the present flex mooring system the reason is that the wave period of the jonswap wave spectrum are all less than 25s but the natural period of the mooring system in horizontal plane motions are respectively 109s and 141 7s which are much more than 25s those show the present flex mooring system doesn t influence wave energy absorbing of wec it is noteworthy that the natural periods of wec are all more than wave spectral peak period 13 5s the sharp eagle wec has superior motion and stability properties 7 2 analysis of tensions of mooring lines and displacements of wec in time domain the wec mooring time domain coupled analysis of wec is carried out and the environmental loads such as viscous damping and current forces coefficients are corrected by experiments tables 7 and 8 time series response spectrum and statistics for 6 dof motions of the hull and tensions of mooring lines are obtained numerical results are compared with the results of irregular wave tests fig 13 and fig 15 depict the time series for the motions of wec hull and tensions of mooring lines in order to exhibit the details of motion and tension responses the time plots are selected from 5500s to 6000s the response spectrums for them are described in fig 16 the statistics are tabulated in tables 9 and 10 the comparison between the numerical and the experimental results shows that the numerical results mostly agree well with the experimental data but there are also differences which can not be ignored in figs 13 and 15 the reason is that the numerical method based on linear potential flow theory fails to incorporate the strong nonlinearities of steep or breaking waves in shallow water and wec motions with large amplitudes in present survival sea state wei 2017 and the draft of sharp eagle wec is 14 m its water plane is very small and the major structure changes very sharply near the waterline when the wec has large heave and pitch amplitude without the consideration of nonlinear factors due to the instantaneous position variation of body surface the nonlinear wave loads wec motion especially heave and pitch with large amplitude are impossible to be accurately predicted in numerical simulation based on linear potential theory experiments are showing for pitch low frequency energy these low frequency energies are lower than pitch natural period that is because of pitch is coupled with heave motion so it would need a finer model to be addressed in numerical modeling the mooring tensions of the superflex mooring system have slower change rates and more uniform than that of the mixed chain mooring system as shown in figs 13d and 14 because the superflex mooring system has enough elastic energy storage and the slope of the mooring stiffness curve is smaller it can be effective to reduce the maximum tensions of mooring lines and instantaneous increased tensions are avoided as much as possible the surge spectrum is a double peaked spectrum in fig 16a both in numerical simulation and experiments the peak periods for which are about 97 s and 13s respectively while the heave spectrum is a single peaked spectrum obtained by experiments the peak period for which is about 13s but a double peaked spectrum in numerical simulation the peak periods for which are about respectively 26s and 13s in fig 16b the pitch spectrum is also a double peaked spectrum obtained by experiments the peak periods for which are about respectively 39 25s and 13s but a single peaked spectrum obtained by numerical simulation the peak period for which is 39 25s in fig 16c for surge and pitch motion low frequency natural frequency and wave frequency motion are all obviously and half the weight of the two for heave motion wave frequency motion consists of the main part it shows that the superflex mooring system has good energy storage characteristics the low frequency drift and wave frequency motion of the device are all allowed so that the device can drift along with the waves within a wavelength range this contributes towards strengthening the overall system security by releasing the wave loads and decreasing the tensions of mooring lines the maximal motions for surge heave sway roll and pitch are 14 3 m 4 m 23 9m 3 8 and 14 7 in heading 45 respectively see table 10 the motions of wec are violent and green water will happen in extreme condition so the wec is not fit for operation in typhoon conditions only survivability need to be addressed as most of the device is submerged this characteristic limits the wave forces since the largest crests will run over the whole device further analysis shows that based on tables 9 and 10 in a heading 0 wave state the mooring line 1 and line 2 play major roles the experimental tensions of mooring line 1 and line 2 are not equal to each other it s due to the pretention of line 1and line 2 cannot be completely consistent resulting in asymmetric motion system in the experiment for stronger one in heading 45 the mooring line 1 plays a major role there is some difference between numerical and experimental results for the tensions of line 3 it can be observed that the numerical displacements of sway and yaw motions of the wec somewhat exceed the experimental ones the reason is that the frictional effects in longer bottom chains segment of line 3 and the bottom of wave basin are obvious in the experiment it s only need smaller displacements of the wec around the center of clump chain to provide adequate yaw righting moment and sway righting force however the frictional effects isn t considered in numerical calculation the larger displacements of the wec around the center of fairlead are required to provide adequate yaw righting moments and sway righting forces while in a heading 90 wave state the mooring line 1 and line 3 play major roles the numerical results and the experimental results of the tensions of mooring line 1 are in good agreement similar to heading 45 cases the frictional effects in longer bottom chains segment of line 3 and the bottom of wave basin brings on the error between the results obtained by numerical simulation and experiment the study of experiment demonstrates that the present flex mooring system can be effective to reduce the maxim tensions of mooring lines and calmly resist extreme storm states the elasticity of the mooring system is almost given by surperflex rope as shown in fig 17 thus there is no need or benefit to increase the length of the chain segment 8 conclusions based on these experimental and numerical evaluations catenary mooring systems may not be the best solution for the wec due to ultra shallow water and large drift loads especially in storm conditions with a spread mooring system using superflex rope allowing in some extent weathervaning of the unit the design presented in this paper offer enough reserve mooring strength to the system and meets the requirements of economy and mooring area restriction in ultra shallow water this system using superflex rope chain and buoy to establish a stiffness curve of the mooring line with small enough slope also allows to have a response more linear to environmental loading and avoids large mooring line tensions it is observed that only using as main part of the mooring system 12 6 m length of superflex ropes can meet design requirements the design water depth is 30 m and significant wave height is 9 07 m which is very shorter than conventional materials for application of 250 m length of low elastic polymeric rope or 630 m length and 80 mm diameter of chain the length and weight of the mooring line and mooring zone are obviously reduced by comparing with conventional mooring systems the hydrodynamic behavior of sharp eagle wec with present superflex rope mooring system in shallow water has been investigated by numerical method and model test demonstrating a good agreements and a reliability of the design for wec s surge and pitch motion low frequency natural frequency and wave frequency motion equivalently participating to the unit response while heave motion in mainly driven by wave frequency motion the mooring tension time history curves of the superflex mooring system have slower change rates and more uniform than that of the mixed chain mooring system because the superflex mooring system has enough elastic capacity and the slope of the mooring stiffness curve is smaller it can be effective to reduce the maxim transient tension of the mooring line and instantaneous increased tension are avoided as much as possible the present flex mooring system also doesn t influence wave energy absorption capacity of wec it is noteworthy that the natural periods of sharp eagle wec are far larger than the 50 years retrun period survival sea state wave peak period 14s providing to the sharp eagle wec very good stability see keeping and station keeping properties as the elasticity of the mooring system is almost given by the surperflex rope there is also no need or benefit from increasing the length of the chain segment superflex ropes are also providing additional elastic strain even when the lines are taut and therefore they have good elastic reserve to absorb wave induced forces all these characteristics are providing advantages for the use of superflex ropes for the mooring of wec devices in ultra shallow water based on a technically sound mooring system design the long term economic and environmental benefits of this alternative design are still to be evaluated in the real sea states the methodology presented in this paper can be used by wave energy developers in the development of cost effective mooring systems in ultra shallow water which will contribute to the efficiency of wave energy devices acknowledgements this work is supported by the

23614,risk based inspection in the maritime sector is an approach that involves the quantitative estimation of the probability of failure and the respective consequences concerning either an equipment item or the hull structure of the vessel the proper risk based inspection plan has great significance on balancing the safe operation requirements and the inspection costs this paper deals with the ageing and the breakdown of the fore part of a ship due to different degradation and failure mechanisms corrosion fatigue deformation and the emerged risks that are related to the property the personnel and the environment the developed model evaluates several probable inspection schemes which diversify based on the inspection effectiveness the time intervals and the corresponding costs keywords risk based inspection fatigue corrosion deformation dynamic bayesian networks hull structure 1 introduction the ships are designed in such a way as to ensure an economically profitable operation throughout their expected lifecycle always in harmony with the conditions and the acceptance criteria set by the rules from the legislator bodies this can be efficiently accomplished through the risk based inspection rbi planning rbi planning aims to the optimization of inspection frequency in order to avoid possible unacceptable risks from under inspections of structural components or from over inspections to functional items the main object of rbi methodology is to identify either structural elements or mechanical equipment which have the highest probability of failure and to organise a plan so as the risk levels will be controlled at reasonable cost chang et al 2005 a dynamic bayesian network dbn is developed for the evaluation of different inspection schemes for the fore part of the vessel in terms of risk and cost by examining different degradation and failure mechanisms the model integrates corrosion fatigue crack initiation and deformation and analyses the probability of occurrence of these damage types for a time period of 15 years and their subsequent consequences for multiple inspection plans with variable effectiveness and implementation time corrosion and fatigue can be regarded as degradation processes with the potential of causing failure of nearly all components of ship furthermore these three mechanisms may lead to lowering the load bearing capacity of the hull structure of the ship and hence overall ship safety the paper is structured as follows a literature review with respect to the applications of rbi in the maritime sector and the offshore industry is presented the next section of the paper consists of a brief description of the different stakeholders that are performing inspections and surveys their key characteristics as well as the identified differences on the implementation of the inspection process this section is followed by the description of the selected methodology the developed model and the quantification process of the model the subsequent section presents the assessment of proposed inspection plans finally the paper concludes with important results and observations derived by the presented analysis 2 literature review the american society of mechanical engineers asme had developed rbi methodology since 1941 but it became common during the 90 s decade tan et al 2011 the earliest application of risk based inspection appeared in the nuclear industry in the 1970 s and by the years it have been implemented into other industries such as the petrochemical industry in the 1980 s and 1990 s and subsequently it extended to rails aircraft and shipping industries conachey et al 2008 the concept of risk based in service inspection was published in early 1990s asme 1991 the cooperation between det norske veritas dnv and the american petroleum institute api in the early 90 led to the birth of the rbi methodology for the oil industry the cooperation involved also a sponsor group of the largest oil companies like amoco dow exxon shell etc the result was the publication of the base resource document which later was published as api 581 rbi as defined by the api 581 constitutes a pioneer approach for inspection planning a theory that establishes as the main targets the safety and integrity of the operating facilities equipment rbi is based on the risk and focuses specifically on the equipment and the corresponding degradation mechanisms it provides a connection between the mechanisms that lead a structural element to failure and the inspection approaches that can successfully mitigate the corresponding risks inspection procedures of marine vessels containing structural elements which are composed of sub elements and components can be enhanced by implementing risk based approaches in a highly complex environment like sea the integrity of the above mentioned systems constitutes a significant role in both their design and operation consequences of a possible failure of a ship may contain human injuries as well as losses economic damages and environmental pollution ayyub et al 2002 on 1st january 2011 the port state control committee pscc of paris memorandum paris mou adopted the new inspection regime nir the major target of the nir was to insert the risk based approach to selecting vessels for inspection in other words nir reward the well maintained ships by reducing aimless inspections while ships of high risk profile are inspected more frequent and detailed moreover the elaborated statistical analysis of knapp and van de velden 2011 on the investigation of ship risk profiles as well as the susceptible areas to general safety conclude that older general cargo ships are highly prone to risk and two regions the caribbean and the gulf of mexico verify the need of port state control inspection because their international legislations does not include smaller ships heij and knapp 2012 provide suggestions for estimating risk at an individual ship by rating various risk factors such as the type of ship the nature of companies and managers historical information on previous accidents inspections detentions etc concerning the seawater ballast tanks paik et al 2004 attempted to estimate the depth of corrosion as a function of time by using a mathematician model which provided the appropriate statistical characteristics their study focused on the prediction of corrosion wastage on low alloy carbon steel plates into seawater ballast tank structures of vessels a study for the calculation of corrosion wastage in ballast tanks of a ship was also considered by gudze and melchers 2008 their model had taken into consideration the operational profile of the examining vessel as well as the several temperatures of the geographical areas where the ship used to operate soares et al 2009 examined further the influence of temperature and marine environment to the corrosion rate on vessels they demonstrated that corrosion is mainly influenced by moisture in marine environments and subsequently the period of exposure to wetness in offshore industry several studied have been performed analysing various risk based approaches offshore platforms are steel structures responsible for extracting and processing oil and natural gas due to the hazardous nature of the extracting products offshore platforms are considered of high risk procedures the attention of risk management is relied on the safety of the crew the integrity of structure the prevention of environmental pollution and the regularity of production brandsaeter 2002 furthermore it should be highlighted that regardless of the harsh environment the platform should maintain its integrity by means of inspection maintenance and repair imr plans the optimization of these plans is to inspect by using the right tool at the right place at the right time and at the lowest cost rouhan and schoefs 2003 the risk based approaches in offshore industry are more targeted to components which may cause disastrous consequences specifically goyet et al 2002 applied a risk based inspection plan for a welded joint in the hull structure of a floating production storage and offloading facilities furthermore straub et al 2006 focused on the economical benefits of adapting risk based inspection planning to offshore platforms their study compared the costs of risk based inspection strategy with the traditional fixed inspection intervals for all possible critical elements imo 2010 dnv distributed a detailed description of risk based inspection on offshore platforms the recommended practice of dnv refers to topside mechanical equipment including similar characteristics to formal safety assessment the study of kawsar et al 2015 was based on the subsea pipeline systems of offshore platforms the proposed probabilistic model was applied to several accidental scenarios to confirm the safety of subsea pipelines under different environmental conditions over the past decade oil and gas operators of floating offshore installations fois such as fpsos fpus and flng units have been slowly pushing for a risk based approach to be applied to these asset types in order to fit better with their operational goals farias and netto 2012 studied the impact of the corrosion on the structural integrity of the hulls of floating production storage and offloading fpso units the traditional class surveys which are based on a periodic class regime encompasses local regulations class society rules and industry standards and practices however the example of oil and gas industry that has long applied risked based methodologies and technology for integrity management shows the extreme capabilities of this approach goyet et al 2010 ku et al 2012 lanquetin et al 2007 3 types of inspections surveys and audits one of the major concerns of ship managers and ship owners is the safety of vessels the main aim of the shipping companies is to validate the strength structure and the equipment systems remain operational in a satisfactory condition inspections as a process assist these companies to reach this goal by recognizing degrading systems or equipments and improving them however surveys do not ensure the safety of passengers and the integrity of the structure thus the possibility of undesirable events does not be minimised only by the frequency of inspections but also by their quality boon et al 2009 different stakeholder shipping companies flag or port states class societies and vetting or insurance companies conduct maritime inspections and their inspection process is analysed below 3 1 inspections of the port state control port state control psc is a regime that enables any port or coastal state to perform safety inspections and to obligate ships which visit these ports to implement the international shipping requirements heij et al 2011 any ship that does not accomplish to qualify the requirements of the coastal control is detained until extra measures should be taken into consideration then the port re examines the ship in order to confirm that the vessel meet the rules and release it rarely a ship which has been detained several times can be banned from re entering to ports ship owners strive to respect the rules in order to avoid any detention that would cause economic harms these harms represent the delays on voyages and the further inspections which are obligatory the major deficiencies that may cause a detention are illustrated in table 1 randic et al 2015 3 2 inspections of the flag state according to the legislation of the flag state in which the ship is registered the inspectors verify the compliance with the following certificates safety equipment safety construction safety radio marpol annex i to vi load line ism isps and mlc a common practice is the administration to outsource the inspection to recognized organisations e g classification societies both the flag state inspectors and the surveyors of the class have the same rights and obligations the only difference relies on the fact that when a surveyor identifies a deficiency the class is obliged to inform the flag state additionally if a certificate is not renewed both the port state and the flag state have to be informed 3 3 inspections of the shipping company the inspection plan of the ships from the shipping company includes usually a six month timeframe by the company shore personnel superintendents technical managers etc in many cases the vessels are inspected more frequent furthermore a company performs also ism and isps audits these audits aim at the identification of strengths and weaknesses of the safety management system of the company the auditor assess the system by sample points thus the auditors assess both the on board and the office personnel these audits are followed by corrective actions and improvement plans and ensure that personnel understand and comply with the requirements and the regulations and that management commitment is evident and strong 3 4 surveys of the class a classification society is a nongovernmental organization that defines the technical standards of a ship building or an offshore structure and supervises their operation the class is responsible for setting the technical rules for the above mentioned constructions monitoring the process in order to confirm that the design meets these rules and subsequently rendering the essential certificates and documents to the ship in order to formalize its operation in addition the organization should survey these constructions to ensure that they proceed in meeting the rules on account of this classification societies organise surveys to make sure that these structures can still operate efficiently 4 selection of the methodology a dynamic probabilistic model is developed in accordance with the dynamic bayesian network dbn methodology a bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their dependencies through a directed acyclic graph dag e g jensen and nielsen 2007 a dag is a directed graph consisting of nodes and directed edges usually represented by arrows connecting them with no directed cycles this means that if a directed path is followed starting from a particular node it is not possible to get to the same node arrows connecting different nodes represent conditional dependencies and they are said to go from the parent node to the child node the nodes of a bn represent stochastic variables and a conditional probability table cpt depending on the node s parents is to be attributed to each node that is a table in which every combination of the states of the parent nodes is associated to a probability distribution for the considered variable therefore a bayesian network provides a compact representation of a joint probability distribution p u of the entire variable domain u x 1 x 2 x n given by the product of all conditional probability tables specified in the bn 1 p u p x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p x i p a x i where pa x i are the set of parent variables of x i and p u reflects the properties of the bn dynamic bayesian networks dbns can be considered as an extension of the static bn by inserting temporal dependencies that reflect the changes of variables over time a basic structure of a dbn is illustrated in fig 1 the current time step is represented by t and the previous time step by t 1 two types of dependencies are identified in a dbn the relationships between variables within the same time slice which are displayed with intra slice arcs and the relationships between variables at different time steps which are displayed with inter slice arcs the states of the system under examination depend only on the states of the previous time step t 1 and the current time step t 1 a dbn consists of the probability distribution function pdf on the sequence of t variables x x1 xt the sequence of t observable variables y y1 yt where t is the timeframe of the given event under consideration this is expressed by the following formula wu et al 2015 2 p x y t 2 t p x t x t 1 t 1 t p y t x t p x 1 in order to completely determine a dbn a set of parameters should explicitly be defined these parameters include the state transition pdfs p xt xt 1 that represents the relationships between the time slices the observation pdfs p yt xt that represents the relationships of observation nodes with regards to other nodes at the time slice t and the initial probability distribution p x1 5 description of the model a dynamic bayesian network is developed for the quantification of the influence of the inspection with respect to three different failure mechanisms corrosion fatigue and deformation observed at the fore part of the ship and as a result to the magnitude of the derived consequences of these mechanisms the developed model predicts the probability of occurrence of these mechanisms for a time period of 15 years and how different inspection plans can reduce the derived total risk by taken into account the cost of the inspections schemes under examination the performed analysis is focused on the forward part of the ship fore section the aft part and the cargo space is out of the scope of this paper the effects of these failure mechanisms on the structural integrity of the fore part of the ship depend highly on the effectiveness of the inspection procedure as well as the time intervals between the performed inspections the key characteristics of the aforementioned mechanisms are presented below corrosion corrosion is the gradual deterioration of a material or its properties through a chemical reaction with its environment tezdogan and demirel 2014 in maritime corrosion may influence negatively and extremely the operability of ships because of the aquatic environment affecting the functioning equipments as well as the ship s structural integrity therefore corrosion consists one of the most important parameters which may limit the service life of a ship by reducing its strength ability and long term structural integrity saad eldeen et al 2011 that chemical phenomenon may lead to thickness penetration cracks and unpredictable failures and as result to disastrous consequences including human losses environmental pollution as well as property damage for the shipping company as far as the fore part of a ship is concerned corrosion may potentially lead to the loss of the ship s side plate at the bow significant local corrosion in the side plates leads to increased stress levels and reduced buckling strength consequently local corrosion may cause loss of a number of stiffeners and the corresponding webframes may collapse finally the propagation of this mechanism may lead to the structural failure of the ship s side plate the ramifications of such an event can be very considerable shell side will lose its watertight integrity the lost buoyancy will have impact on the longitudinal strength and the collision bulkhead will be exposed to dynamic sea loads normally corrosion is recognized according to its type relied on the nature of corroded material the environmental circumstances or the morphology of the corrosion in accordance with the morphology of damage on the corroded metal corrosion can be fragmented in 14 categories stoudt et al 1995 the elaborated analysis is taken into account only the probability of occurrence of the general corrosion in general corrosion the whole exposed surface is attacked uniformly from electrochemical or chemical reactions as a result due to corrosion the metal becomes thinner and its shape of surface alters the remaining corrosion categories are out of the scope of this paper fatigue fatigue is a phenomenon that causes generally occurs on structures under fluctuating loading this happens in ships due to wave loading and loads due to the loading and unloading process fatigue damage can initiate microscopic cracks in structure that can grow and in the worst case scenario to lead to the total collapse of the structure fatigue is caused by repeatedly applied load on structure that is under loading that is below the yield strength of the material beghin 2006 two different types of fracture exist depending on the conditions that led to failure the low cycle fatigue occurring for a low number of cycles and the high cycle fatigue occurring for a high number of cycles fatigue fractures observed on ship steel structures are generally of the second type the maintenance personnel should periodically inspect and perform nondestructive tests to check for fatigue fractures these tests can range from simple visual inspections to more extensive tests such as ultrasonic imaging as a result the effectiveness of the inspection has a tremendous effect regarding the identification of fractures in different structural elements of the hull hull deformation a ship s hull is subjected to different ship loads from service cargo and environmental conditions as a result the hull is deforming until these loads are balanced larger ships are prone to greater risk regarding the failure of the hull due to greater imposed forces the presence of deformation in the hull structure of the ship may lead to unwanted consequences deformed stringers can result to cracks penetrating the shell this will have a significant impact on the trim draught of the ship additionally if the stringers are significantly reduced in strength this will result in the failure of the side longitudinal stiffeners due to excessive loads and potentially the side shell of the fore part will collapse furthermore buckled plating due to bow impact pressure may lead to leakage and damages to longitudinal stiffeners this will reduce their load carrying capacity and subsequently the stringers and the web frames will be affected another significant load on the foreship is the bottom slamming pressure which is induced by waves this type of load may deform the bottom floors and thus the web frames will lose their load carrying capacity as a result this chain of events may lead to the loss of the watertight integrity of the fore section the main structural elements of the forward part of the ship are the collision bulkhead the stiffeners the web frames the stringers and the floors these fundamental structural elements as well as the whole fore part are evaluated against degradation and failure mechanisms for multiple inspection schemes with different time intervals and efficiency the schematic diagram of the forward part is shown in fig 2 there are mainly two supporting types of the forward section the first one uses as the main reinforcement of the side plates the transverse side frames and the second one uses longitudinal side stiffeners in the first case horizontal stiffening the external loads on the side plates are received by the transverse side frames which are supported by the stringers while in the second case vertical stiffening side longitudinal stiffeners receive the external loads which are supported by the web frames which in sequence are supported by the stringers fig 3 illustrates the developed dynamic bayesian network it presents the qualitative dependencies between the selected variables nodes each arrow represents the influence of a variable on another and the red arrows indicate that the influence occurs in a next time period furthermore the influence of the nodes corrosion fatigue and deformation on their own value at a future time point is illustrated as a self loop in the dbn in fig 3 the analytical description and the states of each node are presented in table 2 the representation of the nodes is color labelled and an explanation of the color grouping is as follows 5 1 group of nodes degradation and failure mechanisms orange color this group of nodes describes the probability of occurrence of degradation mechanisms on the ship s metal structure for 15 years these nodes are the corrosion and fatigue the node deformation is also included and describes the extent of deformation that may occur on a ship s metal structure for the same time period which is a significant factor that affects the structural reliability these three failure mechanisms are selected as the most significant based on the feedback from experts of the maritime domain structural components blue color these nodes include the main structural elements that are located in the fore part the interaction between the nodes is consistent with the theory regarding the transfer of the load that was outlined in detail in the previous section these nodes are the stringers web frames floors and longitudinal stiffeners in the elaborated analysis it is assumed that the main reinforcing components are the longitudinal stiffeners vertical stiffening the course of damage propagation with green color this group of nodes represent the starting point and the damage propagation pertinent to the fore end structure these nodes are the shell cracking ship side collapse flooding of fore part collision bulkhead collapse flooding of cargo hold 1 and the node hull structure additional risk parameters with light blue color this group of nodes include parameters that have significant impact on the degradation and failure mechanism as well as on the consequences derived from these mechanisms these nodes are the weather sea zone ship type and the crucial for the developed model node inspection for the time being the model is quantified only for general cargo ships to allow the model to be extended to other ship types this node was introduced consequences with red color this group of nodes represent the ramifications of the damage to the personnel of the ship the environment and the property of the shipping company these nodes are the human casualty property damage and environmental impact 5 2 quantification of the model the quantification of the developed dbn was not a trivial process considering the limited availability of data and as a result the quantification of the conditional probability tables cpt of the model were based on expert elicitation the necessary information for the quantification of a model may be elicited directly or indirectly low choy et al 2009 the most common elicitation methods are elicitation of probability frequency quantity weighting quantitative interval probability distribution categorical measure and relative measure kuhnert et al 2010 the first six methods are applied for the elicitation of quantitative values whereas the last two methods for the elicitation of qualitative values in the context of the direct elicitation the experts are asked to provide quantitative numbers whereas for indirect elicitation only qualitative responses are sufficient in this study the option of the direct elicitation was selected the expert shared their knowledge in terms of quantities they provided statistical data which were derived mainly from inspections reports in some limited cases where there wasn t the necessary information in the inspection reports the quantification was based on their judgment which was achieved under guided discussion and only when unanimity was reached several experts were used and they were selected so that their combined maritime safety expertise would be rather diverse the expert group consisted of six people with the following backgrounds expert a an academic expert in hull strength expert b a safety designated person ashore of a greek shipping company operating general cargo ships and tankers expert c a chief engineer at a greek shipping company operating containerships and bulkers vessels expert d a representative of the greek flag authority expert e a technical manager of a greek shipping company expert f an inspector of a classification society 6 presentation of results the developed dbn model assesses the influence of the inspection regarding the occurrence and the impact of the corrosion fatigue and deformation on the structural condition of the fore part of the ship the inspection effectiveness depends on the personnel s training the applied tools methods and the inspection intervals by applying as evidence the states of the node inspection in different time slices years the model predicts the magnitude of the consequences of the failure mechanisms under examination the states of the node inspection are no inspection usual effectiveness and high effectiveness the state usual effectiveness represents the conducted intermediate survey of a general cargo vessel and the high effectiveness the renewal survey six 6 inspection schemes were selected for the calculation of the risk and they are presented below a no inspection for all time slices b usual effectiveness at years 5 and 10 no inspection for the rest time slices c high effectiveness at years 5 and 10 no inspection for the rest time slices d usual effectiveness at year 5 no inspection for the rest time slices e high effectiveness at years 5 and 10 usual effectiveness at years 3 8 and 13 no inspection for the rest time slices f high effectiveness at years 5 and 10 usual effectiveness at years 1 3 6 8 11 and 13 no inspection for the rest time slices the status quo regarding the time intervals of the implemented inspection plans includes one intermediate survey every 2 and ½ years and one renewal survey every five years as a result the inspection plan e reflects more or less the current situation although inspection plans b and c propose less inspections for the selected time period 15 years than the existing legislative framework their comparison with the existing inspection plan e provide interesting insights the time intervals of the inspection scheme f are less and as a result the applied inspections are more frequent finally the inspection plan a represents a theoretically approximation of the occurrence of the corrosion fatigue and deformation and their respective consequences since no inspection is implemented for the selected time period fig 4 demonstrates the probabilities of the state heavy corrosion for the different inspection schemes the probability of heavy corrosion after 15 years without any inspection plan a equals to 0 237 the probability calculation for this inspection plan was based solely on the expert judgement the inspection variable when set to usual effectiveness at years 5 and 10 plan b with probability 100 causes the model to predict that the probability of occurrence for heavy corrosion after 15 years will be 0 101 since the hull structure is inspected twice in this time period the final prediction for the existence of heavy corrosion is less than the previous scenario another significant factor that affects the outcome is not only the time intervals of the inspections but also the efficiency of the inspection process plan c consists of the same time intervals with plan b but for this scenario the inspection node is set to high effectiveness hence the probability of heavy corrosion will be 0 089 plan e include not only inspections with less intervals but also a combination of usual effectiveness and high effectiveness this plan results in even less probability of occurrence for high corrosion and equals to 0 027 finally the 15 year effects are less significant regarding inspection plan f with a lesser probability 0 018 of heavy corrosion this mainly relies on the fact that plan f considers even more inspections for the selected time period the predicted probabilities for the state heavy corrosion for the six inspection schemes are shown in table 3 the impact of the inspection process in terms of probability is depicted in the next time slice that practically means if the ship is inspected in the fifth year of its operation then the probability of occurrence of a failure mechanism will be significantly less in the next year figs 5 and 6 and present the predicted probabilities for the states large cracks and extensive deformation respectively the impact of each inspection plan on the consequences property damage human casualty and environmental impact is presented in table 4 the potential propagation of the corrosion or fatigue or deformation may lead to the structural failure of the fore part and as a result to the total loss of the ship in this case scenario the property damage will be significant since the ship has sank and the total loss may lead to the loss of the crewmembers or and to pollution the probabilities of selected states refer to the time slice 15 inspection plan a gathers the highest probabilities regarding the occurrence of the consequences the probabilities of the property damage the human casualty and the environmental impact equal to 0 0539 0 0061 and 0 0018 respectively whereas the plan f is proven more efficient than the rest inspection plans since it gathers the lowest values for the purposes of the analysis it was considered useful to compare the predicted probabilities for the consequences with the corresponding values with respect to structural failures for the entire ship from the published fsa as shown in table 5 missing values indicate unavailable probabilities the comparison shows that the probabilities calculated with the developed dbn are of the order of magnitude with the corresponding values from the various fsa studies order of magnitude 10 3 tables 6 8 illustrate the comparative analysis between the different inspection plans and the percentage variation of the consequences the comparison between the plan a two inspections of usual effectiveness per five time slices and plan a no inspection at any time slice shows that the probability for total loss of the ship due to structural failure is decreased by 49 the probability for loss of life by 35 and the probability for potential pollution by 47 this is considered reasonable when taking into account that plan a does not include any inspection for 15 years and as a result the deterioration of the fore part is significantly greater particular interest relies on the comparison between the plan e and plan c the plan e represents a classic inspection plan while plan c is a modification of plan e without the intermediate inspections it is clear that the implementation of additional inspections have a significant impact on the probabilities of the consequences specifically the probabilities of property damage human casualty and environmental impact are decreased approximately by 48 27 and 21 respectively rbi methodology aims at the identification of structural elements or mechanical equipment which have the highest probability of failure and to organise a plan so as the risk levels to be dealt with reasonable cost following this rationale the next step of the analysis includes the quantification of the total risk of the consequences pertinent to each inspection plan see fig 7 the total risk is determined by multiplying the predicted probabilities of each consequence with the corresponding monetary values it should be also pointed that in the final total risk they are taken into account also the expenses of the conducted inspections in the various time slices see table 9 the value of an average general cargo ship is assumed to be 12 000 000 based on financial data provided by clarkson s 2016 the average amount of oil spill per pollution event is assumed 120 tones imo 2010 the cost of spilling v tones of oil can be approximated using imo 2011 3 c o s p v 67 275 v 0 5893 furthermore to create a common basis for the consequences the personal damage is monetized using a statistical value of a prevented fatality of 3 million usd skjong et al 2007 finally table presents the respective costs of an intermediate and a renewal survey since the cost of the inspections are spread over 15 years the present value of the cash outflows is also calculated finally an influence diagram is developed for the estimation of the total risk at the end of the selected time period 15th year by implementing the respective costs derived from the consequences the type and the number of the inspections the total risk for each inspection plan is presented in table 10 the highest risk is estimated for plan a as expected since no inspection is conducted to the hull structure of the fore part for the time period of the 15 years a point of interest derives from the comparison of plan c and e the total risk of plan e differs only by 1 from plan c however by comparing the total consequence risk without taking into account the costs of inspections it is observed that the risk of plan e is reduced by 13 compared to the risk of plan c this observation is showing that with careful planning is possible to maintain the total risk in the same level and meanwhile reduce the risk related to the consequences an additional interesting point lies between the results of plan e and plan f at this case the total risk is increased by 9 if plan f is selected however the risk related to the consequences is decreased only by 1 finally comparing plan c and plan d it is observed that plan c has reduced the total risk by 7 furthermore the risk that pertain only to the consequences and not by taking into account the cost of inspections is 15 less when the plan c is applied instead of plan d therefore the inspection internals every five time slices outweigh in every aspect the inspection intervals of every ten time slices concluding the presentation of the results fig 8 demonstrates the percentage contribution of the inspection costs of each plan to the estimation of the total risk the assigned costs of plans b and d consist of the 6 8 of the total risk the contribution of the inspection costs of plans e and f 22 8 and 30 6 respectively is substantially higher because these two inspection schemes include more inspections for the same time period the ultimate goal of the risk based inspection is to find the equilibrium between the minimization of the risk pertinent to the structural failure and the inspection costs 7 conclusions and future work dynamic bayesian networks are a powerful tool for the development of decision support systems that produce outputs in alignment with maritime domain experts on the inspection of the hull structure of the ship the developed model simulates the process of hull deterioration under the influence of the most significant failure mechanisms the model focuses on the forward part of a ship additionally it depicts with a quantitative and easily perceivable manner how the inspection process efficiency and intervals affect the risks pertinent to the safety of the ship and its personnel as well as to the environmental protection the herein conducted analysis clearly showed that the minimization of the time of the inspection campaigns results in more precise estimates with respect to the risk inspection scheme e includes more inspections than the scheme c and this differentiation reduces the consequence risk by 13 furthermore the inspection efficiency has a detrimental effect even for the same inspection time intervals in particular the probability for total loss of the ship due to structural failure is decreased by 6 the probability for loss of life by 3 5 and the probability for potential pollution by 5 6 respectively when the inspection plan c is implemented instead of plan b the produced results indicate that dbns have a higher accuracy in estimating the evolution of the probabilistic dependencies over time than the static bns however the developed dbn has also some limitations the elaborated model is applied only at the fore part of the hull more concrete and reliable results will be achieved if the future work would focus on the whole hull structure of the ship and by examining not only the general cargo vessels but also and other ship types furthermore the corrosion fatigue cracking initiation and deformation may pose a great threat for the structural integrity of the ship but at the same time are complex failure mechanisms that are affected by various variables some indicative influencing parameters are the quality of the initial coating the cargo type and handling the operational profile and area of the ship as well as the dynamic loads e g waves these influencing factors were not including in the developed model since the quantification of the dbn was solely based on expert group judgement future work should also consider the dependencies of the aforementioned parameters with the occurrence of ship corrosion fatigue and deformation 
23614,risk based inspection in the maritime sector is an approach that involves the quantitative estimation of the probability of failure and the respective consequences concerning either an equipment item or the hull structure of the vessel the proper risk based inspection plan has great significance on balancing the safe operation requirements and the inspection costs this paper deals with the ageing and the breakdown of the fore part of a ship due to different degradation and failure mechanisms corrosion fatigue deformation and the emerged risks that are related to the property the personnel and the environment the developed model evaluates several probable inspection schemes which diversify based on the inspection effectiveness the time intervals and the corresponding costs keywords risk based inspection fatigue corrosion deformation dynamic bayesian networks hull structure 1 introduction the ships are designed in such a way as to ensure an economically profitable operation throughout their expected lifecycle always in harmony with the conditions and the acceptance criteria set by the rules from the legislator bodies this can be efficiently accomplished through the risk based inspection rbi planning rbi planning aims to the optimization of inspection frequency in order to avoid possible unacceptable risks from under inspections of structural components or from over inspections to functional items the main object of rbi methodology is to identify either structural elements or mechanical equipment which have the highest probability of failure and to organise a plan so as the risk levels will be controlled at reasonable cost chang et al 2005 a dynamic bayesian network dbn is developed for the evaluation of different inspection schemes for the fore part of the vessel in terms of risk and cost by examining different degradation and failure mechanisms the model integrates corrosion fatigue crack initiation and deformation and analyses the probability of occurrence of these damage types for a time period of 15 years and their subsequent consequences for multiple inspection plans with variable effectiveness and implementation time corrosion and fatigue can be regarded as degradation processes with the potential of causing failure of nearly all components of ship furthermore these three mechanisms may lead to lowering the load bearing capacity of the hull structure of the ship and hence overall ship safety the paper is structured as follows a literature review with respect to the applications of rbi in the maritime sector and the offshore industry is presented the next section of the paper consists of a brief description of the different stakeholders that are performing inspections and surveys their key characteristics as well as the identified differences on the implementation of the inspection process this section is followed by the description of the selected methodology the developed model and the quantification process of the model the subsequent section presents the assessment of proposed inspection plans finally the paper concludes with important results and observations derived by the presented analysis 2 literature review the american society of mechanical engineers asme had developed rbi methodology since 1941 but it became common during the 90 s decade tan et al 2011 the earliest application of risk based inspection appeared in the nuclear industry in the 1970 s and by the years it have been implemented into other industries such as the petrochemical industry in the 1980 s and 1990 s and subsequently it extended to rails aircraft and shipping industries conachey et al 2008 the concept of risk based in service inspection was published in early 1990s asme 1991 the cooperation between det norske veritas dnv and the american petroleum institute api in the early 90 led to the birth of the rbi methodology for the oil industry the cooperation involved also a sponsor group of the largest oil companies like amoco dow exxon shell etc the result was the publication of the base resource document which later was published as api 581 rbi as defined by the api 581 constitutes a pioneer approach for inspection planning a theory that establishes as the main targets the safety and integrity of the operating facilities equipment rbi is based on the risk and focuses specifically on the equipment and the corresponding degradation mechanisms it provides a connection between the mechanisms that lead a structural element to failure and the inspection approaches that can successfully mitigate the corresponding risks inspection procedures of marine vessels containing structural elements which are composed of sub elements and components can be enhanced by implementing risk based approaches in a highly complex environment like sea the integrity of the above mentioned systems constitutes a significant role in both their design and operation consequences of a possible failure of a ship may contain human injuries as well as losses economic damages and environmental pollution ayyub et al 2002 on 1st january 2011 the port state control committee pscc of paris memorandum paris mou adopted the new inspection regime nir the major target of the nir was to insert the risk based approach to selecting vessels for inspection in other words nir reward the well maintained ships by reducing aimless inspections while ships of high risk profile are inspected more frequent and detailed moreover the elaborated statistical analysis of knapp and van de velden 2011 on the investigation of ship risk profiles as well as the susceptible areas to general safety conclude that older general cargo ships are highly prone to risk and two regions the caribbean and the gulf of mexico verify the need of port state control inspection because their international legislations does not include smaller ships heij and knapp 2012 provide suggestions for estimating risk at an individual ship by rating various risk factors such as the type of ship the nature of companies and managers historical information on previous accidents inspections detentions etc concerning the seawater ballast tanks paik et al 2004 attempted to estimate the depth of corrosion as a function of time by using a mathematician model which provided the appropriate statistical characteristics their study focused on the prediction of corrosion wastage on low alloy carbon steel plates into seawater ballast tank structures of vessels a study for the calculation of corrosion wastage in ballast tanks of a ship was also considered by gudze and melchers 2008 their model had taken into consideration the operational profile of the examining vessel as well as the several temperatures of the geographical areas where the ship used to operate soares et al 2009 examined further the influence of temperature and marine environment to the corrosion rate on vessels they demonstrated that corrosion is mainly influenced by moisture in marine environments and subsequently the period of exposure to wetness in offshore industry several studied have been performed analysing various risk based approaches offshore platforms are steel structures responsible for extracting and processing oil and natural gas due to the hazardous nature of the extracting products offshore platforms are considered of high risk procedures the attention of risk management is relied on the safety of the crew the integrity of structure the prevention of environmental pollution and the regularity of production brandsaeter 2002 furthermore it should be highlighted that regardless of the harsh environment the platform should maintain its integrity by means of inspection maintenance and repair imr plans the optimization of these plans is to inspect by using the right tool at the right place at the right time and at the lowest cost rouhan and schoefs 2003 the risk based approaches in offshore industry are more targeted to components which may cause disastrous consequences specifically goyet et al 2002 applied a risk based inspection plan for a welded joint in the hull structure of a floating production storage and offloading facilities furthermore straub et al 2006 focused on the economical benefits of adapting risk based inspection planning to offshore platforms their study compared the costs of risk based inspection strategy with the traditional fixed inspection intervals for all possible critical elements imo 2010 dnv distributed a detailed description of risk based inspection on offshore platforms the recommended practice of dnv refers to topside mechanical equipment including similar characteristics to formal safety assessment the study of kawsar et al 2015 was based on the subsea pipeline systems of offshore platforms the proposed probabilistic model was applied to several accidental scenarios to confirm the safety of subsea pipelines under different environmental conditions over the past decade oil and gas operators of floating offshore installations fois such as fpsos fpus and flng units have been slowly pushing for a risk based approach to be applied to these asset types in order to fit better with their operational goals farias and netto 2012 studied the impact of the corrosion on the structural integrity of the hulls of floating production storage and offloading fpso units the traditional class surveys which are based on a periodic class regime encompasses local regulations class society rules and industry standards and practices however the example of oil and gas industry that has long applied risked based methodologies and technology for integrity management shows the extreme capabilities of this approach goyet et al 2010 ku et al 2012 lanquetin et al 2007 3 types of inspections surveys and audits one of the major concerns of ship managers and ship owners is the safety of vessels the main aim of the shipping companies is to validate the strength structure and the equipment systems remain operational in a satisfactory condition inspections as a process assist these companies to reach this goal by recognizing degrading systems or equipments and improving them however surveys do not ensure the safety of passengers and the integrity of the structure thus the possibility of undesirable events does not be minimised only by the frequency of inspections but also by their quality boon et al 2009 different stakeholder shipping companies flag or port states class societies and vetting or insurance companies conduct maritime inspections and their inspection process is analysed below 3 1 inspections of the port state control port state control psc is a regime that enables any port or coastal state to perform safety inspections and to obligate ships which visit these ports to implement the international shipping requirements heij et al 2011 any ship that does not accomplish to qualify the requirements of the coastal control is detained until extra measures should be taken into consideration then the port re examines the ship in order to confirm that the vessel meet the rules and release it rarely a ship which has been detained several times can be banned from re entering to ports ship owners strive to respect the rules in order to avoid any detention that would cause economic harms these harms represent the delays on voyages and the further inspections which are obligatory the major deficiencies that may cause a detention are illustrated in table 1 randic et al 2015 3 2 inspections of the flag state according to the legislation of the flag state in which the ship is registered the inspectors verify the compliance with the following certificates safety equipment safety construction safety radio marpol annex i to vi load line ism isps and mlc a common practice is the administration to outsource the inspection to recognized organisations e g classification societies both the flag state inspectors and the surveyors of the class have the same rights and obligations the only difference relies on the fact that when a surveyor identifies a deficiency the class is obliged to inform the flag state additionally if a certificate is not renewed both the port state and the flag state have to be informed 3 3 inspections of the shipping company the inspection plan of the ships from the shipping company includes usually a six month timeframe by the company shore personnel superintendents technical managers etc in many cases the vessels are inspected more frequent furthermore a company performs also ism and isps audits these audits aim at the identification of strengths and weaknesses of the safety management system of the company the auditor assess the system by sample points thus the auditors assess both the on board and the office personnel these audits are followed by corrective actions and improvement plans and ensure that personnel understand and comply with the requirements and the regulations and that management commitment is evident and strong 3 4 surveys of the class a classification society is a nongovernmental organization that defines the technical standards of a ship building or an offshore structure and supervises their operation the class is responsible for setting the technical rules for the above mentioned constructions monitoring the process in order to confirm that the design meets these rules and subsequently rendering the essential certificates and documents to the ship in order to formalize its operation in addition the organization should survey these constructions to ensure that they proceed in meeting the rules on account of this classification societies organise surveys to make sure that these structures can still operate efficiently 4 selection of the methodology a dynamic probabilistic model is developed in accordance with the dynamic bayesian network dbn methodology a bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their dependencies through a directed acyclic graph dag e g jensen and nielsen 2007 a dag is a directed graph consisting of nodes and directed edges usually represented by arrows connecting them with no directed cycles this means that if a directed path is followed starting from a particular node it is not possible to get to the same node arrows connecting different nodes represent conditional dependencies and they are said to go from the parent node to the child node the nodes of a bn represent stochastic variables and a conditional probability table cpt depending on the node s parents is to be attributed to each node that is a table in which every combination of the states of the parent nodes is associated to a probability distribution for the considered variable therefore a bayesian network provides a compact representation of a joint probability distribution p u of the entire variable domain u x 1 x 2 x n given by the product of all conditional probability tables specified in the bn 1 p u p x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p x i p a x i where pa x i are the set of parent variables of x i and p u reflects the properties of the bn dynamic bayesian networks dbns can be considered as an extension of the static bn by inserting temporal dependencies that reflect the changes of variables over time a basic structure of a dbn is illustrated in fig 1 the current time step is represented by t and the previous time step by t 1 two types of dependencies are identified in a dbn the relationships between variables within the same time slice which are displayed with intra slice arcs and the relationships between variables at different time steps which are displayed with inter slice arcs the states of the system under examination depend only on the states of the previous time step t 1 and the current time step t 1 a dbn consists of the probability distribution function pdf on the sequence of t variables x x1 xt the sequence of t observable variables y y1 yt where t is the timeframe of the given event under consideration this is expressed by the following formula wu et al 2015 2 p x y t 2 t p x t x t 1 t 1 t p y t x t p x 1 in order to completely determine a dbn a set of parameters should explicitly be defined these parameters include the state transition pdfs p xt xt 1 that represents the relationships between the time slices the observation pdfs p yt xt that represents the relationships of observation nodes with regards to other nodes at the time slice t and the initial probability distribution p x1 5 description of the model a dynamic bayesian network is developed for the quantification of the influence of the inspection with respect to three different failure mechanisms corrosion fatigue and deformation observed at the fore part of the ship and as a result to the magnitude of the derived consequences of these mechanisms the developed model predicts the probability of occurrence of these mechanisms for a time period of 15 years and how different inspection plans can reduce the derived total risk by taken into account the cost of the inspections schemes under examination the performed analysis is focused on the forward part of the ship fore section the aft part and the cargo space is out of the scope of this paper the effects of these failure mechanisms on the structural integrity of the fore part of the ship depend highly on the effectiveness of the inspection procedure as well as the time intervals between the performed inspections the key characteristics of the aforementioned mechanisms are presented below corrosion corrosion is the gradual deterioration of a material or its properties through a chemical reaction with its environment tezdogan and demirel 2014 in maritime corrosion may influence negatively and extremely the operability of ships because of the aquatic environment affecting the functioning equipments as well as the ship s structural integrity therefore corrosion consists one of the most important parameters which may limit the service life of a ship by reducing its strength ability and long term structural integrity saad eldeen et al 2011 that chemical phenomenon may lead to thickness penetration cracks and unpredictable failures and as result to disastrous consequences including human losses environmental pollution as well as property damage for the shipping company as far as the fore part of a ship is concerned corrosion may potentially lead to the loss of the ship s side plate at the bow significant local corrosion in the side plates leads to increased stress levels and reduced buckling strength consequently local corrosion may cause loss of a number of stiffeners and the corresponding webframes may collapse finally the propagation of this mechanism may lead to the structural failure of the ship s side plate the ramifications of such an event can be very considerable shell side will lose its watertight integrity the lost buoyancy will have impact on the longitudinal strength and the collision bulkhead will be exposed to dynamic sea loads normally corrosion is recognized according to its type relied on the nature of corroded material the environmental circumstances or the morphology of the corrosion in accordance with the morphology of damage on the corroded metal corrosion can be fragmented in 14 categories stoudt et al 1995 the elaborated analysis is taken into account only the probability of occurrence of the general corrosion in general corrosion the whole exposed surface is attacked uniformly from electrochemical or chemical reactions as a result due to corrosion the metal becomes thinner and its shape of surface alters the remaining corrosion categories are out of the scope of this paper fatigue fatigue is a phenomenon that causes generally occurs on structures under fluctuating loading this happens in ships due to wave loading and loads due to the loading and unloading process fatigue damage can initiate microscopic cracks in structure that can grow and in the worst case scenario to lead to the total collapse of the structure fatigue is caused by repeatedly applied load on structure that is under loading that is below the yield strength of the material beghin 2006 two different types of fracture exist depending on the conditions that led to failure the low cycle fatigue occurring for a low number of cycles and the high cycle fatigue occurring for a high number of cycles fatigue fractures observed on ship steel structures are generally of the second type the maintenance personnel should periodically inspect and perform nondestructive tests to check for fatigue fractures these tests can range from simple visual inspections to more extensive tests such as ultrasonic imaging as a result the effectiveness of the inspection has a tremendous effect regarding the identification of fractures in different structural elements of the hull hull deformation a ship s hull is subjected to different ship loads from service cargo and environmental conditions as a result the hull is deforming until these loads are balanced larger ships are prone to greater risk regarding the failure of the hull due to greater imposed forces the presence of deformation in the hull structure of the ship may lead to unwanted consequences deformed stringers can result to cracks penetrating the shell this will have a significant impact on the trim draught of the ship additionally if the stringers are significantly reduced in strength this will result in the failure of the side longitudinal stiffeners due to excessive loads and potentially the side shell of the fore part will collapse furthermore buckled plating due to bow impact pressure may lead to leakage and damages to longitudinal stiffeners this will reduce their load carrying capacity and subsequently the stringers and the web frames will be affected another significant load on the foreship is the bottom slamming pressure which is induced by waves this type of load may deform the bottom floors and thus the web frames will lose their load carrying capacity as a result this chain of events may lead to the loss of the watertight integrity of the fore section the main structural elements of the forward part of the ship are the collision bulkhead the stiffeners the web frames the stringers and the floors these fundamental structural elements as well as the whole fore part are evaluated against degradation and failure mechanisms for multiple inspection schemes with different time intervals and efficiency the schematic diagram of the forward part is shown in fig 2 there are mainly two supporting types of the forward section the first one uses as the main reinforcement of the side plates the transverse side frames and the second one uses longitudinal side stiffeners in the first case horizontal stiffening the external loads on the side plates are received by the transverse side frames which are supported by the stringers while in the second case vertical stiffening side longitudinal stiffeners receive the external loads which are supported by the web frames which in sequence are supported by the stringers fig 3 illustrates the developed dynamic bayesian network it presents the qualitative dependencies between the selected variables nodes each arrow represents the influence of a variable on another and the red arrows indicate that the influence occurs in a next time period furthermore the influence of the nodes corrosion fatigue and deformation on their own value at a future time point is illustrated as a self loop in the dbn in fig 3 the analytical description and the states of each node are presented in table 2 the representation of the nodes is color labelled and an explanation of the color grouping is as follows 5 1 group of nodes degradation and failure mechanisms orange color this group of nodes describes the probability of occurrence of degradation mechanisms on the ship s metal structure for 15 years these nodes are the corrosion and fatigue the node deformation is also included and describes the extent of deformation that may occur on a ship s metal structure for the same time period which is a significant factor that affects the structural reliability these three failure mechanisms are selected as the most significant based on the feedback from experts of the maritime domain structural components blue color these nodes include the main structural elements that are located in the fore part the interaction between the nodes is consistent with the theory regarding the transfer of the load that was outlined in detail in the previous section these nodes are the stringers web frames floors and longitudinal stiffeners in the elaborated analysis it is assumed that the main reinforcing components are the longitudinal stiffeners vertical stiffening the course of damage propagation with green color this group of nodes represent the starting point and the damage propagation pertinent to the fore end structure these nodes are the shell cracking ship side collapse flooding of fore part collision bulkhead collapse flooding of cargo hold 1 and the node hull structure additional risk parameters with light blue color this group of nodes include parameters that have significant impact on the degradation and failure mechanism as well as on the consequences derived from these mechanisms these nodes are the weather sea zone ship type and the crucial for the developed model node inspection for the time being the model is quantified only for general cargo ships to allow the model to be extended to other ship types this node was introduced consequences with red color this group of nodes represent the ramifications of the damage to the personnel of the ship the environment and the property of the shipping company these nodes are the human casualty property damage and environmental impact 5 2 quantification of the model the quantification of the developed dbn was not a trivial process considering the limited availability of data and as a result the quantification of the conditional probability tables cpt of the model were based on expert elicitation the necessary information for the quantification of a model may be elicited directly or indirectly low choy et al 2009 the most common elicitation methods are elicitation of probability frequency quantity weighting quantitative interval probability distribution categorical measure and relative measure kuhnert et al 2010 the first six methods are applied for the elicitation of quantitative values whereas the last two methods for the elicitation of qualitative values in the context of the direct elicitation the experts are asked to provide quantitative numbers whereas for indirect elicitation only qualitative responses are sufficient in this study the option of the direct elicitation was selected the expert shared their knowledge in terms of quantities they provided statistical data which were derived mainly from inspections reports in some limited cases where there wasn t the necessary information in the inspection reports the quantification was based on their judgment which was achieved under guided discussion and only when unanimity was reached several experts were used and they were selected so that their combined maritime safety expertise would be rather diverse the expert group consisted of six people with the following backgrounds expert a an academic expert in hull strength expert b a safety designated person ashore of a greek shipping company operating general cargo ships and tankers expert c a chief engineer at a greek shipping company operating containerships and bulkers vessels expert d a representative of the greek flag authority expert e a technical manager of a greek shipping company expert f an inspector of a classification society 6 presentation of results the developed dbn model assesses the influence of the inspection regarding the occurrence and the impact of the corrosion fatigue and deformation on the structural condition of the fore part of the ship the inspection effectiveness depends on the personnel s training the applied tools methods and the inspection intervals by applying as evidence the states of the node inspection in different time slices years the model predicts the magnitude of the consequences of the failure mechanisms under examination the states of the node inspection are no inspection usual effectiveness and high effectiveness the state usual effectiveness represents the conducted intermediate survey of a general cargo vessel and the high effectiveness the renewal survey six 6 inspection schemes were selected for the calculation of the risk and they are presented below a no inspection for all time slices b usual effectiveness at years 5 and 10 no inspection for the rest time slices c high effectiveness at years 5 and 10 no inspection for the rest time slices d usual effectiveness at year 5 no inspection for the rest time slices e high effectiveness at years 5 and 10 usual effectiveness at years 3 8 and 13 no inspection for the rest time slices f high effectiveness at years 5 and 10 usual effectiveness at years 1 3 6 8 11 and 13 no inspection for the rest time slices the status quo regarding the time intervals of the implemented inspection plans includes one intermediate survey every 2 and ½ years and one renewal survey every five years as a result the inspection plan e reflects more or less the current situation although inspection plans b and c propose less inspections for the selected time period 15 years than the existing legislative framework their comparison with the existing inspection plan e provide interesting insights the time intervals of the inspection scheme f are less and as a result the applied inspections are more frequent finally the inspection plan a represents a theoretically approximation of the occurrence of the corrosion fatigue and deformation and their respective consequences since no inspection is implemented for the selected time period fig 4 demonstrates the probabilities of the state heavy corrosion for the different inspection schemes the probability of heavy corrosion after 15 years without any inspection plan a equals to 0 237 the probability calculation for this inspection plan was based solely on the expert judgement the inspection variable when set to usual effectiveness at years 5 and 10 plan b with probability 100 causes the model to predict that the probability of occurrence for heavy corrosion after 15 years will be 0 101 since the hull structure is inspected twice in this time period the final prediction for the existence of heavy corrosion is less than the previous scenario another significant factor that affects the outcome is not only the time intervals of the inspections but also the efficiency of the inspection process plan c consists of the same time intervals with plan b but for this scenario the inspection node is set to high effectiveness hence the probability of heavy corrosion will be 0 089 plan e include not only inspections with less intervals but also a combination of usual effectiveness and high effectiveness this plan results in even less probability of occurrence for high corrosion and equals to 0 027 finally the 15 year effects are less significant regarding inspection plan f with a lesser probability 0 018 of heavy corrosion this mainly relies on the fact that plan f considers even more inspections for the selected time period the predicted probabilities for the state heavy corrosion for the six inspection schemes are shown in table 3 the impact of the inspection process in terms of probability is depicted in the next time slice that practically means if the ship is inspected in the fifth year of its operation then the probability of occurrence of a failure mechanism will be significantly less in the next year figs 5 and 6 and present the predicted probabilities for the states large cracks and extensive deformation respectively the impact of each inspection plan on the consequences property damage human casualty and environmental impact is presented in table 4 the potential propagation of the corrosion or fatigue or deformation may lead to the structural failure of the fore part and as a result to the total loss of the ship in this case scenario the property damage will be significant since the ship has sank and the total loss may lead to the loss of the crewmembers or and to pollution the probabilities of selected states refer to the time slice 15 inspection plan a gathers the highest probabilities regarding the occurrence of the consequences the probabilities of the property damage the human casualty and the environmental impact equal to 0 0539 0 0061 and 0 0018 respectively whereas the plan f is proven more efficient than the rest inspection plans since it gathers the lowest values for the purposes of the analysis it was considered useful to compare the predicted probabilities for the consequences with the corresponding values with respect to structural failures for the entire ship from the published fsa as shown in table 5 missing values indicate unavailable probabilities the comparison shows that the probabilities calculated with the developed dbn are of the order of magnitude with the corresponding values from the various fsa studies order of magnitude 10 3 tables 6 8 illustrate the comparative analysis between the different inspection plans and the percentage variation of the consequences the comparison between the plan a two inspections of usual effectiveness per five time slices and plan a no inspection at any time slice shows that the probability for total loss of the ship due to structural failure is decreased by 49 the probability for loss of life by 35 and the probability for potential pollution by 47 this is considered reasonable when taking into account that plan a does not include any inspection for 15 years and as a result the deterioration of the fore part is significantly greater particular interest relies on the comparison between the plan e and plan c the plan e represents a classic inspection plan while plan c is a modification of plan e without the intermediate inspections it is clear that the implementation of additional inspections have a significant impact on the probabilities of the consequences specifically the probabilities of property damage human casualty and environmental impact are decreased approximately by 48 27 and 21 respectively rbi methodology aims at the identification of structural elements or mechanical equipment which have the highest probability of failure and to organise a plan so as the risk levels to be dealt with reasonable cost following this rationale the next step of the analysis includes the quantification of the total risk of the consequences pertinent to each inspection plan see fig 7 the total risk is determined by multiplying the predicted probabilities of each consequence with the corresponding monetary values it should be also pointed that in the final total risk they are taken into account also the expenses of the conducted inspections in the various time slices see table 9 the value of an average general cargo ship is assumed to be 12 000 000 based on financial data provided by clarkson s 2016 the average amount of oil spill per pollution event is assumed 120 tones imo 2010 the cost of spilling v tones of oil can be approximated using imo 2011 3 c o s p v 67 275 v 0 5893 furthermore to create a common basis for the consequences the personal damage is monetized using a statistical value of a prevented fatality of 3 million usd skjong et al 2007 finally table presents the respective costs of an intermediate and a renewal survey since the cost of the inspections are spread over 15 years the present value of the cash outflows is also calculated finally an influence diagram is developed for the estimation of the total risk at the end of the selected time period 15th year by implementing the respective costs derived from the consequences the type and the number of the inspections the total risk for each inspection plan is presented in table 10 the highest risk is estimated for plan a as expected since no inspection is conducted to the hull structure of the fore part for the time period of the 15 years a point of interest derives from the comparison of plan c and e the total risk of plan e differs only by 1 from plan c however by comparing the total consequence risk without taking into account the costs of inspections it is observed that the risk of plan e is reduced by 13 compared to the risk of plan c this observation is showing that with careful planning is possible to maintain the total risk in the same level and meanwhile reduce the risk related to the consequences an additional interesting point lies between the results of plan e and plan f at this case the total risk is increased by 9 if plan f is selected however the risk related to the consequences is decreased only by 1 finally comparing plan c and plan d it is observed that plan c has reduced the total risk by 7 furthermore the risk that pertain only to the consequences and not by taking into account the cost of inspections is 15 less when the plan c is applied instead of plan d therefore the inspection internals every five time slices outweigh in every aspect the inspection intervals of every ten time slices concluding the presentation of the results fig 8 demonstrates the percentage contribution of the inspection costs of each plan to the estimation of the total risk the assigned costs of plans b and d consist of the 6 8 of the total risk the contribution of the inspection costs of plans e and f 22 8 and 30 6 respectively is substantially higher because these two inspection schemes include more inspections for the same time period the ultimate goal of the risk based inspection is to find the equilibrium between the minimization of the risk pertinent to the structural failure and the inspection costs 7 conclusions and future work dynamic bayesian networks are a powerful tool for the development of decision support systems that produce outputs in alignment with maritime domain experts on the inspection of the hull structure of the ship the developed model simulates the process of hull deterioration under the influence of the most significant failure mechanisms the model focuses on the forward part of a ship additionally it depicts with a quantitative and easily perceivable manner how the inspection process efficiency and intervals affect the risks pertinent to the safety of the ship and its personnel as well as to the environmental protection the herein conducted analysis clearly showed that the minimization of the time of the inspection campaigns results in more precise estimates with respect to the risk inspection scheme e includes more inspections than the scheme c and this differentiation reduces the consequence risk by 13 furthermore the inspection efficiency has a detrimental effect even for the same inspection time intervals in particular the probability for total loss of the ship due to structural failure is decreased by 6 the probability for loss of life by 3 5 and the probability for potential pollution by 5 6 respectively when the inspection plan c is implemented instead of plan b the produced results indicate that dbns have a higher accuracy in estimating the evolution of the probabilistic dependencies over time than the static bns however the developed dbn has also some limitations the elaborated model is applied only at the fore part of the hull more concrete and reliable results will be achieved if the future work would focus on the whole hull structure of the ship and by examining not only the general cargo vessels but also and other ship types furthermore the corrosion fatigue cracking initiation and deformation may pose a great threat for the structural integrity of the ship but at the same time are complex failure mechanisms that are affected by various variables some indicative influencing parameters are the quality of the initial coating the cargo type and handling the operational profile and area of the ship as well as the dynamic loads e g waves these influencing factors were not including in the developed model since the quantification of the dbn was solely based on expert group judgement future work should also consider the dependencies of the aforementioned parameters with the occurrence of ship corrosion fatigue and deformation
