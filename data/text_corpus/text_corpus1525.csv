7625,study region southwest china study focus terrestrial water storage tws changes estimated from the global navigation satellite system gnss and gravity recovery and climate experiment missions grace grace fo are critical data sets for hydrological studies to obtain a broader and unified spatiotemporal scale than a single method we designed two improved joint inversion methods jims the joint inversion method 1 and 2 jim1 and jim2 are based on grace grace fo derived virtual stations and 3 degree mascons from jet propulsion laboratory respectively we focused on investigating tws changes in southwest china using jim1 and jim2 new hydrological insight for the region the synthetic test showed that jim1 and jim2 had lower root mean square errors than a gnss only inversion method gnss im with reductions of 22 and 37 respectively confirming their feasibility the results of jims using actual gnss and grace grace fo data showed that the area averaged jims tws estimates were consistent with grace grace fo tws and gnss im tws but jim2 tws was overfit to gnss im tws then we utilized jim1 tws to investigate hydro climate relationships and quantify drought events the results revealed a strong agreement between jim1 d tws d t and precipitation evapotranspiration runoff with a correlation coefficient of 0 89 precipitation contributed the most to tws changes furthermore three hydrological drought events were detected with the third event being the most severe lasting for 20 months resulting in a total tws loss of 501 km3 and being categorized as an exceptional drought

introduction terrestrial water storage tws an important component of the global water cycle is composed of canopy water glaciers rivers lakes artificial reservoirs soils and groundwater together pokhrel et al 2021 tapley et al 2019 southwest china located in the southeast of the tibetan plateau has a typical subtropical monsoon climate resulting in a strong seasonality in temporal pattern of tws the summer southwest monsoon and east asian monsoon bring a large amount of water vapor from the indian ocean and the pacific ocean supplementing the tws in the form of precipitation and making the tws huge in this region affected by dry monsoons from inland the region becomes relatively dry during winter wang et al 2015 drought events are common in the region when monsoon activities are abnormal ding and gao 2020 han et al 2019 long et al 2014 therefore monitoring tws changes in this region and quantifying tws deficits and hydrological drought events are of great significance for agricultural production socio economic development and revealing local hydrodynamic processes this information is also beneficial for local water government departments to make resource management decisions to estimate the tws changes various hydrological models such as the global land data assimilation system gldas and the water global assessment and prognosis watergap döll et al 2014 döll et al 2003 simulate hydrological processes using mathematical models mo et al 2016 scanlon et al 2019 singh et al 2017 syed et al 2008 these hydrological models generally simplify complex hydrological processes and cannot completely model all water compositions scanlon et al 2018 schumacher et al 2018 soltani et al 2020 soltani et al 2021 space geodetic technologies such as the global navigation satellite system gnss and the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and its successor grace fo provide new tools for estimating tws changes without relying on modeling these technologies provide relatively complete information about water compositions grace grace fo twin satellite gravity missions track monthly earth s gravity field changes with a spatial resolution of 350 km tapley et al 2004 providing a space based technology for studying tws changes schmidt et al 2006 grace grace fo observations are successfully applied to study global and large scale tws changes and extreme hydrological events droughts and floods in brazil goncalves et al 2020 china sun et al 2018 xu et al 2019 africa anyah et al 2018 and the indus basin sinha et al 2019 etc limited by the coarse spatial resolution grace grace fo is sensitive to regional long wavelength signals but difficult to capture local short wavelength signals vertical displacements of gnss networks which record the earth s elastic response caused by hydrological mass changes with millimeter accuracy are sensitive to local short wavelength signals and can also be used to track losses and gains of tws döll et al 2014 the seasonal temporal trend of gnss vertical displacement agrees well with that of grace grace fo inferred tws this makes gnss a useful tool for investigating tws changes extreme hydrological events and global climate changes chew and small 2014 wahr et al 2013 wang et al 2017 previous studies have established a gnss only inversion method gnss im by employing green s function farrell 1972 with the preliminary reference earth model prem this method can invert gnss measured surface movements into high resolution water thickness changes hsu et al 2020 jiang et al 2022 2021a 2021c jin and zhang 2016 gnss is suitable for estimating tws in areas with dense gnss stations it can provide new supplementary data for hydrological studies argus et al 2014 2017 fu et al 2015 to take full advantage of the hydrological models gnss and grace grace fo data researchers have attempted to combine the various data sources to investigate tws changes in terms of assimilating hydrological models and geodetic data yin et al 2020 integrated grace grace fo data and a hydrological model to improve the estimates of groundwater storage changes tangdamrongsub et al 2019 integrated a hydrological model grace grace fo data and gnss data to investigate the surface deformation caused by reservoir impoundment and flood gnss and grace grace fo data are also often used together to analyze tws changes more comprehensively in many studies materna et al 2021 used gnss and grace grace fo data to investigate the seasonal characteristics of hydrological loading in south and southeast asia xue et al 2021 used gnss grace grace fo and land assimilation systems to analyze the surface deformation caused by various water storage changes in the great lakes region of the united states furthermore many researchers have analyzed tws changes in southwest china using grace grace fo and gnss observations long et al 2014 used grace grace fo data to analyze the trend of tws changes and investigate extreme hydrological events in this region wu et al 2020 used grace grace fo data to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of tws deficit in this region and combined meteorological data to analyze the driving factors of hydrological drought jiang et al 2017 used gnss data and grace grace fo data to detect the interannual variations of tws and hydrological drought events in the region they found that gnss vertical displacements will subside if grace grace fo derived tws increases jiang et al 2021b inverted gnss vertical displacements to tws changes and combined grace grace fo and gldas data to analyze the seasonal changes of tws in this area however previous studies have shown that there are differences in the spatial distribution and temporal patterns of tws changes estimated by gnss and grace grace fo in the region which makes it challenging to quantify tws changes by unifying these two geodetic observations the same problem exists in other regions such as california usa argus et al 2014 and the western united states fu et al 2015 the reasons for these differences may be that 1 grace grace fo has a coarser spatial resolution 350 km 2 there is a deterioration in data quality later in the grace mission 3 the signal may be suppressed when removing noise from grace grace fo data 4 there are other unmodeled non hydrologic loading signals such as common mode errors cme ming et al 2016 yuan et al 2018 and draconitic signals fu et al 2015 which are usually difficult to separate from gnss observations completely 5 tws inferred from irregular gnss networks has large uncertainty fok and liu 2019 6 the poroelastic displacements caused by underground water is opposite to the elastic displacements which significantly affect the gnss measured hydrological loading displacements argus et al 2017 7 the inelastic and irreversible compaction of aquifer units caused by groundwater extraction can lead to inelastic surface deformation mirzadeh et al 2021 the joint inversion methods jims developed in previous studies can integrate gnss and grace grace fo observations to produce more accurate tws estimates whereas the applicability of different jims has never been compared these jims can be classified into two types the first method is constrained by grace grace fo derived virtual stations fok and liu 2019 and liu et al 2019 have proposed a jim using vertical displacements from gnss and grace grace fo to improve tws estimations in southwest china however this jim only uses relatively few grace grace fo derived virtual stations in areas with sparse gnss stations it makes the grace grace fo data unable to constrain the tws across the entire region which means that the advantages of the regional long wavelength sensitivity of grace grace fo cannot be fully exploited meanwhile this jim cannot be easily applied to other regions because determining the optimal location and number of virtual stations is challenging the second method is constrained by 2 dimensional operators that can sum or average grace grace fo data adusumilli et al 2019 designed a jim by using a summation operator on grace data and carlson et al 2022 constructed a jim by averaging the equal area 3 degree spherical cap mass concentration blocks mascons of grace grace fo from jet propulsion laboratory jpl the weighting factors are employed to adjust the contributions of gnss vertical displacements grace grace fo observations and laplace smoothing constraint to tws estimates in these two jims these two jims determine the weighting factors using trade off curves or similar methods however it is not easy to choose two optimal weighting factors simultaneously because this method may be subjective and computationally expensive optimal weighting factors are key to jims as suboptimal weighting factors probably lead to increased uncertainty of tws estimates fortunately the akaike s bayesian information criterion abic which has been used to estimate the weighting factors of data in geodetic inversion studies fukahata et al 2004 provides a foundation for the development of jims funning et al 2014 pan et al 2019 yi et al 2017 in this study we aim to improve these two types of jims and compare their effects in southwest china we design two improved jims joint inversion method 1 jim1 and joint inversion method 2 jim2 using grace grace fo derived vertical displacements of virtual stations and equal area 3 degree mascons of grace grace fo from jpl respectively the relative weighting factor between gnss and grace grace fo as well as the smoothing factor of the prior constraint are selected for the two jims using the abic method the grace grace fo virtual stations in jim1 are set to cover the whole region and their number is carefully selected we verify the theoretical validity of the improved jims by using chessboard tests and synthetic tests furthermore by comparing the tws changes estimated by the two improved jims with those from gnss im grace grace fo mascon solutions from the center for space research csr and jpl gldas precipitation and the water balance equation tws p r e precipitation runoff evapotranspiration the actual effectiveness of the two improved jims is verified this analysis also helps to reveal the spatiotemporal characteristics of tws changes in the study area finally we select the tws estimates inferred from the best performing jim to quantify drought events during the period of 01 2011 12 2020 2 data 2 1 gnss data processing we obtained gnss daily time series of 44 stations across southwest china during 01 2011 12 2020 from the china crustal movement observation network cmonoc these data are generated using the gamit globk software the solution strategy for these gnss data is shown in text s1 and provided by the china earthquake data center cedc we removed one station with a low signal to noise ratio and one station with missing data for more than 5 years the remaining 42 stations are shown in fig 1 we only used the vertical displacements of these gnss stations in this study because hydrological mass loading changes have 2 3 times more significant impact on vertical displacements than on horizontal displacements wahr et al 2013 the non hydrological environmental loading effect in the gnss time series was corrected using the non tidal atmospheric loading ntal and non tidal ocean loading ntol displacement products with a sampling interval of 3 h and a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 provided by geoforschungszentrum gfz https www gfz potsdam de en home based on the thermal expansion model proposed by yan et al 2009 the vertical displacements of gnss stations caused by the thermoelastic effect were corrected using daily temperature data with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 provided by the china meteorological administration cma then we modeled the gnss time series and solved for linear seasonal and offset terms of this model using the least squares regression method the gnss time series model is as follows 1 y t i y 0 v 0 t i k 1 2 c k cos 2 k π t i s k sin 2 k π t i j 1 n g j h t i t g j e t i where y 0 is the standard position of the station v 0 is the linear velocity c k and s k are the amplitude of the seasonal terms j 1 n g j h t i t g j is the offset terms since tws changes contribute the most to the seasonal term of gnss vertical displacements we removed the linear and offset terms to obtain the displacements of water mass loading furthermore gnss data gaps are common on account of poor observation conditions and instrument power failures thus the gnss missing data interpolation software gmis liu et al 2018 which integrates the kriging spatial interpolation algorithm and kalman time optimal estimation algorithm was adopted to fill the gnss data gaps gmis can estimate missing gnss data based on the temporal and spatial characteristics of the displacements from the input gnss stations a detailed description of the gmis processing is presented in text s2 to reduce the noise in the gnss time series we employed the independent component analysis ica to filter the seasonal and interannual signals of hydrological loading from gnss vertical displacements the ica method which assumes the components are independent and non gaussian is often used to identify the primary spatial and temporal characteristics of complex data due to the non gaussian probability distribution function of gnss time series ming et al 2016 the ica method is also suitable for separating the clean gnss vertical displacements caused by hydrological loading hsu et al 2020 fig 2 shows the spatial variations and temporal functions of four independent components ics with a total variance reduction of 93 6 the seasonal signal is mainly contained in ic1 and ic2 whose variance contributions to the filtered data are 87 8 and 5 6 the phases of the annual peak for ic1 and ic2 are on the 274th and 180th day of the year respectively indicating that there possibly are multi timescale tws changes in our study area jiang et al 2021b the variance contributions of ic3 and ic4 to the filtered data are 3 8 and 2 8 respectively these ics may be associated with extreme hydrological events for example ic3 shows a decreasing trend during 2015 2018 corresponding to a wet period and ic4 shows an increasing trend during 2019 2020 corresponding to a dry period we calculated the power spectral density function of the unfiltered and filtered gnss vertical displacement time series of which the results for four gnss stations are shown in fig s2 the results show that the annual corresponding to the first peak and semi annual corresponding to the second peak signals of the filtered and unfiltered gnss time series are almost identical this indicates that the processed gnss time series retain the seasonal hydrological signals completely the annual amplitudes of most gnss stations are 6 mm fig s3 revealing the obvious seasonal changes of the hydrological mass in our study area the gnss stations with the largest amplitudes 8 12 mm and the smallest amplitudes 3 5 mm are clustered in the southwestern and northeastern areas respectively this indicates the obvious spatial heterogeneity in tws changes across the study area 2 2 grace grace fo mascon data we also used the grace and grace fo mascon solutions during 01 2011 12 2020 provided by csr https www gfz potsdam de en home and jpl http www2 csr utexas edu grace to obtain monthly tws changes these two products have been widely used in studies investigating regional tws changes sun et al 2018 vishwakarma et al 2021 the mascon solutions estimated by inter satellite range rate measurements provide a better signal to noise ratio compared to spherical harmonics products the c20 and c30 after june 2018 coefficients of these two mascon solutions are replaced by the c20 and c30 solutions from satellite laser ranging slr loomis et al 2019 respectively because the c20 and c30 solutions of slr have smaller uncertainty the degree 1 coefficients geocenter motion of these solutions are corrected by the method proposed by sun et al 2016 and swenson et al 2008 the post glacial rebound is corrected using the ice 6g d model peltier et al 2018 the csr rl06 mascon solutions are estimated as regular hexagonal mass grids at approximately 1 of equatorial longitude and avoid leakage of land signals into the ocean by dividing a grid into two parts at the land sea boundary save et al 2016 the jpl mascon solutions are given as the equal area 3 degree spherical cap mascons and correct the leakage errors using filters at the coastline watkins et al 2015 although these two mascon solutions differ in forms they both have a practical spatial resolution of 350 km determined by the orbital altitude of the grace and grace fo satellites tapley et al 2004 we chose the csr and jpl mascon solutions for jim1 and jim2 respectively theoretically the selection of the mascon solutions has little effect on the results of jims because the spatial and temporal trends of these two mascon solutions are nearly identical figs 5 and 6 2 3 hydrological model in this study the global land data assimilation system gldas model provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https disc gsfc nasa gov was used to validate the jims tws results the gldas noah 2 1 model which is driven by multiple meteorological fields including atmospheric precipitation and radiation fields simulates the monthly hydrological cycle processes rodell et al 2004 this model provides shallow soil water components at a depth of 2 m below the surface snow water equivalent and canopy water it has been widely used to investigate water resources in china bai et al 2016 chen et al 2020 2 4 meteorological and hydrological data and drought index monthly precipitation data were obtained from the cma the noah land surface model of gldas and the fifth generation european reanalysis era5 dataset provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf https cds climate copernicus eu cdsapp home monthly evaporation and runoff data were obtained from the noah clsm and vic land surface models within the gldas framework as well as the era5 dataset the cma dataset employs a grid size of 0 5 0 5 the noah datasets adopt a finer resolution of 0 25 0 25 the clsm and vic datasets employ a grid size of 1 1 the era5 datasets employ a grid size of 0 1 0 1 the generalized three cornered hat gtch method galindo et al 2001 was employed to evaluate the uncertainty of the multiple precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff datasets tab s2 the results show that the precipitation datasets of noah the evapotranspiration data of vic and the runoff data of noah exhibits the least uncertainty we utilized these three datasets to validate our tws results the meteorological drought index was obtained from the monthly self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi at 0 5 0 5 grids provided by the climatic research unit cru of the university of east anglia https research portal uea ac uk en datasets 3 methods 3 1 gnss only inversion method the earth s surface elastic displacements which can be measured with millimeter accuracy by gnss stations capture the hydrological mass changes the surface displacements are determined by the spatial distribution of the loading sources they can be expressed as linear relationships as follows 2 d g x e where x is the mass loading vector d is the loading displacements vector e is the error term and g is the load green s coefficient matrix calculated by the load love numbers wang et al 2012 from the preliminary reference earth model prem dziewonski and anderson 1981 the detailed calculation principle of g can be found in the study of farrell 1972 in this study based on the least squares algorithm the tws changes were estimated as the equivalent water height ewh in grids with an interval of 0 5 0 5 using the gnss vertical displacements caused by hydrological loading since the number of observations of gnss is less than that of the tws estimates a priori laplace spatial smoothing constraint are added to the inversion model the objective function can be minimized as follows tikhonov and arsenin 1977 3 f x σ 1 g x d 2 β 2 l x 2 min which is equivalent to 4 f x g x d t e 1 g x d x t β 2 l t l x e σ 2 where σ is a diagonal matrix whose main diagonal elements are the standard deviations of the vector β is a smoothing factor adjusting the spatial roughness and data fitting and l is a laplace second order smoothing matrix with the template of 0 1 0 1 4 1 0 1 0 which ensures the smoothness of the ewh estimates on the adjacent grids to fit better with the actual spatial distribution of tws once the optimal β ˆ is determined the ewh estimates x ˆ can be found 5 x ˆ g t e 1 g β ˆ l t l 1 g t e 1 d we discuss the selection method of the optimal smoothing factor for gnss im in detail in section 3 3 3 2 joint inversion methods previous studies have shown that there are spatiotemporal differences in gnss im tws and grace grace fo tws in southwest china to combine the strengths of both gnss and grace grace fo there are two main types of jims of gnss and grace data that were developed in previous studies here we improved those jims to design jim1 and jim2 we evaluate the uncertainty of two jims in text s3 note that the method for selecting inversion parameters is detailed in section 3 3 3 2 1 joint inversion method 1 by improving the jim strategy proposed by fok and liu 2019 termed jim f19 we designed jim1 utilizing gnss and grace grace fo derived vertical displacements based on green s function theory firstly we set up virtual observation stations of grace grace fo evenly across the whole study area the vertical displacements of virtual stations were calculated by the grace grace fo mascon solutions from csr using the forward model 5 d g r a c e g r a c e f o g g r a c e g r a c e f o m g r a c e g r a c e f o where d g r a c e g r a c e f o is the grace grace fo derived displacements vector of the vertical stations g g r a c e g r a c e f o is the load green s coefficient matrix corresponding to the virtual stations and m g r a c e g r a c e f o is the grace grace fo mascon solutions matrix corresponding to the grids in our study area secondly determining the location and number of virtual stations is critical for jim1 to determine the most suitable distribution of virtual stations we tested the spatial resolution of the virtual stations based inversion by a chessboard test the checkerboard test is also been often used in previous studies to analyze the resolution of inversions carlson et al 2022 fu et al 2015 the results show that the spatial resolution is close to 3 5 3 5 which matches the original spatial resolution of grace grace fo 350 km when the interval between the virtual stations is set to 2 5 fig s4 since the virtual stations are evenly distributed and have a 2 5 interval which is just smaller than the size of each 3 5 degree mass grid most of the tws signals can be just recovered thus we set the interval of the virtual stations to 2 5 to determine the appropriate number of the virtual stations the spatial distribution of the virtual stations was set as in fig s4 then the vertical displacements of the gnss and virtual stations were used to estimate the tws changes of which the new observations and coefficients matrices are as follows 7 d 1 d g n s s d g r a c e g r a c e f o t g 1 g g n s s g g r a c e g r a c e f o t next the weighting factor α 1 was used to adjust the contributions of these observations to avoid increased uncertainty of tws estimates because gnss and grace grace fo observations are two independent and uncorrelated types of data the variances matrix e α 1 2 of jim1 is as follows 8 e α 1 2 α 1 2 σ g n s s 2 0 0 σ g r a c e g r a c e f o 2 the newly constructed observations matrix coefficients matrix and variances matrix were substituted into the eq 3 the tws estimates of jim1 can be solved as follows 9 x ˆ 1 g 1 t e α ˆ 1 2 1 g 1 β ˆ 1 l t l 1 g 1 t e α ˆ 1 2 1 d 1 finally the time varying estimates of tws were obtained for each epoch using jim1 note that when we executed the jim1 processing the variances matrices σ g n s s and σ g r a c e g r a c e f o were set as unit matrices because the standard deviations of observations of the same type are close jim1 is essentially an improvement over jim f19 which can help to apply jim1 to other regions easier jim f19 only adds grace grace fo virtual stations in areas where gnss stations are sparse and thus grace grace fo data cannot constrain tws estimates for the whole study area it cannot be directly adapted to other regions because determining the optimal location and number of virtual stations is challenging in contrast our jim1 introduces two major advancements firstly virtual observation stations are deployed throughout the entire study area their distribution is adjusted to match to the actual spatial resolution of grace grace fo using a checkboard test this approach facilitates the generalization of jim1 to other regions secondly a weighting factor is introduced to determine the appropriate weighting between gnss and grace grace fo data thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting 3 2 2 joint inversion method 2 the observation vector of jim2 was constructed based on the gnss vertical observations and the equal area 3 degree spherical cap mascons from jpl the observation equation of the jpl mascon in jim2 is 10 s j p l m j p l s j p l x where m j p l is the values of jpl mascon released as 0 5 grids s is the sum operator which can sum all the grid values in each jpl mascon the form of s is 11 s j p l 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 where each row of s j p l corresponds to a jpl mascon the essence of jim2 is to constrain gnss im according to the actual spatial resolution of jpl masocns combining eqs 2 and 10 the observation vector and coefficient matrix of jim2 can be obtained as follows 12 d 2 d g n s s s j p l m j p l t g 2 g g n s s s j p l t similar to jim1 we used the weighting factor α 2 to adjust the relative weighting of gnss and jpl observations aiming to avoid increased uncertainty of tws estimates the variances matrix e α 2 2 and estimates of jim2 are similar to jim1 13 e α 2 2 α 2 2 σ g n s s 2 0 0 σ j p l 2 14 x ˆ 2 g 2 t e α ˆ 2 2 1 g 2 β ˆ 2 l t l 1 g 2 t e α ˆ 2 2 1 d 2 the model of jim2 is based on jim proposed by carlson et al 2022 with our main improvements focused on determining the weighting factors see section 3 3 3 3 abic method for selecting optimal parameters the optimal weighting factors α ˆ and β ˆ are crucial for jims while the inaccurate weighting factors could lead to ineffective jims or make the spatial distribution of the tws estimates differ from the actual one a high α could make the tws estimates overfit to grace grace fo observations but over deviate from gnss observations resulting in a low spatial resolution of the tws estimates conversely a low α value could make the tws estimates overfit to gnss observations furthermore a high β could lead to overly smoothed tws estimates while a low β could produce rough results which are both severely inconsistent with the actual spatial distribution of tws in previous studies of jims adusumilli et al 2019 carlson et al 2022 the trade off curve or similar method hansen and o leary 1993 has been used to determine the weighting factors but it may be subjective and computationally expensive in this study the abic method which has been used to determine weighting factors for geodetic inversions fukahata et al 2004 pan et al 2019 yi et al 2017 was applied to determine the weighting factors α and β simultaneously the abic method uses maximum likelihood estimates to determine the weights of observations and prior constraints in a jim for an earthquake funning et al 2014 it is ultimately expressed as a minimizing abic function as follows 15 abic α 2 β 2 n log f x ˆ log g t e α ˆ 2 1 g β 2 l t l log β 2 l t l log e α ˆ 2 c f x g x d t e α ˆ 2 1 g x d x t β 2 l t l x where n is the number of observations denotes the product of the absolute values of the non zero eigenvalues of the matrix x ˆ is given by eqs 9 and 14 and c is a constant that can be ignored when solving for the optimal weighting factors the corresponding optimal weighting factors α ˆ and β ˆ will be found if the minimum value of abic is searched to improve the search efficiency we used the quasi newton method to search for the minimum value of abic furthermore when the grace grace fo observations are not considered the abic method can also determine the smoothing factor for gnss im in order to search for the optimal weighting factors we applied the two improved jims to the may 2020 dry period when gnss im tws and grace grace fo tws had the largest spatiotemporal differences in our study area the abic distribution of these two improved jims is shown in fig 3 the optimal weighting factors are found when abic 1 obtains the minimum value at log α 2 0 5 log β 2 3 and abic 2 obtains the minimum value at log α 2 6 log β 2 3 fig s5 shows the spatial distribution of gnss im ewh jims ewh and grace grace fo ewh in may 2020 3 4 synthetic test we designed a synthetic test to verify the theoretical feasibility of the two jims the original ewh was derived from the annual amplitude of gldas the synthetic vertical displacements of gnss were computed through the forward model using the original ewh the vertical displacements of virtual stations for jim1 were also derived through the forward model using the original ewh the average values of tws within each equal area 3 degree spherical cap mascon from jpl were utilized as simulated jpl grace grace fo mascon solutions for jim2 to enhance the fidelity of the simulation we introduced the white gaussian noise with standard deviations of 0 8 mm and 15 mm to gnss and grace grace fo observations respectively 3 5 evaluation indicators the correlation coefficient cc and root mean square errors rmse were commonly used in hydrological studies to evaluate the performance of models here we used these two indicators to evaluate the correlation and differences between jims tws gnss im tws grace grace fo tws and gldas tws the cc values with a range of 1 1 can be applied to quantify the correlation between estimates and observations the rmse with a range of 0 is often applied to assess the overall deviations of estimates relative to observations and a small rmse value will be obtained if estimates are close to observations these two indicators are expressed as follows 16 c c i 1 n y i y o i o i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n o i o 2 17 r m s e i 1 n y i o i 2 n where y i is the estimates y is the average value of y i o i is the observation and o is the average value of o i 4 results 4 1 results of synthetic test gnss im jim1 and jim2 were implemented to estimate the tws the results of these three schemes were generally consistent with the spatial distribution of the original ewh figs 4a 4d indicating that these three schemes can recover most of the tws in our study area in addition we calculated the residuals of the two jims to evaluate their precisions figs 4e 4g the rmse values of the two jims ewh are both smaller than those of gnss im the rmse and residuals indicate that both jims tws estimates are more reliable we also find that the smallest residuals of gnss im and jims are located in the center of our study area with dense gnss stations while the largest residuals are located in the surrounding areas with sparse gnss stations the spatial distributions of residuals show that the precisions of these three inversions are largely determined by the density of gnss stations in areas with sparser gnss stations the results may be less accurate however due to constraints of the grace grace fo virtual stations across the whole study area the residuals of jims are smaller than those of gnss im indicating that jims perform better over the whole study area the results of the synthetic test demonstrate the high feasibility of the two jims in our study area 4 2 spatial patterns of annual tws amplitudes the spatial distributions of the annual tws amplitudes inferred from jims gnss im csr and jpl grace grace fo mascon solutions and gldas are shown in fig 5 the greatest annual tws amplitudes of all water products are found in the southwest of our study area conversely the smallest annual tws amplitudes are found in the east of our study area the results of the annual tws amplitudes show that these water products have similar spatial distributions over the whole study area however there are differences in the spatial distribution of gnss im ewh compared to that of the csr and jpl grace grace fo mascon solutions and gldas in some local areas such as positions a b and c gnss im ewh has the largest annual amplitude 280 mm in the southwestern mountains position a while the largest annual amplitudes of csr and jpl grace grace fo ewh and gldas ewh 240 mm 280 mm and 120 mm respectively are located southwest of position a in the southeastern mountains position c there are relatively large annual ewh amplitudes of gnss im but they are not found in the two grace grace fo mascon solutions and gldas the reason is probably that the gnss im ewh in positions a and c has a high level of uncertainty due to the sparse gnss stations fig 1 the gnss im ewh has a relatively large annual amplitude in northern yunnan and southern sichuan position b which can also be found in gldas but not in two grace grace fo mascon solutions the investigations conducted by jiang et al 2017 and jiang et al 2021a 2021b and 2021c have reported large gnss vertical displacements or gnss im ewh annual amplitudes at position b which is consistent with our results while gldas incompletely models all hydrological composition it has a high resolution with the noah model operating at a resolution of 0 25 0 25 thus the slight ewh signal in this local area which is difficult to identify by grace grace fo can be captured by dense gnss stations those results show that the gnss im tws exhibits higher resolution than grace grace fo tws in local areas with dense gnss stations while the grace grace fo results are more reliable in regions with sparse gnss station coverage in terms of jims the spatial distribution characteristics of annual amplitudes for jim1 ewh and jim2 ewh are consistent with those of grace grace fo ewh and gldas ewh at positions a and c the spatial distribution characteristics of ewh amplitudes demonstrate that jim1 and jim2 can improve the accuracy of tws in the areas with sparse gnss stations using the grace grace fo observations in addition the spatial distribution characteristics of annual jims ewh amplitudes are consistent with those of gnss im ewh and gldas ewh at position b retaining the local hydrological signals with high resolution provided by dense gnss stations our results show that the two improved jims integrate the complementary benefits of different spatial scales offered by gnss and grace grace fo we also specifically discuss the spatial resolution of jim1 tws and jim2 tws in section 5 1 which helps to visually understand the effects of jims 4 3 temporal patterns of area averaged tws we compared the temporal patterns of area averaged ewh changes of yunnan province fig 1 inferred from the various data and two jims fig 6 these ewh changes show similar seasonal temporal patterns which reach their minimum and maximum in approximately may and september of each year respectively however the annual amplitude of the gnss im ewh time series is larger than that of grace grace fo and gldas table 1 the annual amplitude of the jim1 ewh time series is between those of grace grace fo ewh and gnss im ewh the amplitude of the jim2 ewh time series is extremely close to that of gnss im ewh we calculated the cc and rmse values between various water products table 1 quantifying the performance of these water products on temporal patterns all cc values are greater than 0 8 showing that the seasonal temporal trends of these water products are similar to each other the cc and rmse values between csr and jpl grace grace fo ewh show that the temporal patterns of these two grace grace fo mascon solutions are almost identical however relatively high rmse values are found between the gnss im ewh and grace grace fo ewh as well as the gnss im ewh and gldas ewh indicating that there are large discrepancies of magnitude between the temporal pattern of gnss im ewh and that of the grace grace fo ewh as well as gldas ewh the discrepancies between the gnss im ewh and grace grace fo ewh may be due to the coarse resolution of grace grace fo unevenly distributed gnss stations fok and liu 2019 non hydrological load signals argus et al 2017 fu et al 2015 etc for the differences between gnss im ewh or grace grace fo ewh and gldas ewh it may be caused by the simplification of the hydrological cycle without considering deep groundwater in the model which could produce underestimated tws results we compared the temporal patterns of the two improved jims ewh to determine the most appropriate jim there are high cc values and low rmse values between jim1 ewh and grace grace fo ewh csr and jpl table 1 which indicates that jim1 reduces the difference of the temporal pattern between grace grace fo ewh and gnss im ewh according to the cc and rmse values between jim1 ewh and gldas ewh we also find that the temporal pattern of jim1 ewh is closer to that of gldas ewh than gnss im ewh jim2 ewh and gnss im ewh have the greatest cc value and smallest rmse value while the cc and rmse values between jim2 ewh and grace grace fo ewh are relatively lower and higher respectively the results of these two jims show that jim1 can better unify the tws temporal pattern between gnss im ewh and grace grace fo ewh while the jim2 tws temporal pattern tends to overfit that of gnss im tws the difference in results between jim1 and jim2 may be caused by the different relative weighting factors α fig 3 thus we only discuss jim1 tws in subsequent sections 4 4 consistency of tws changes with hydrological and climate variables our study area is located in a low latitude zone and the main supply source of tws is precipitation analyzing the relationship between tws changes and precipitation can help reveal the terrestrial water cycle the various ewh and precipitation time series of yunnan province as well as their monthly average values are shown in fig 7 due to the influence of a typical subtropical monsoon climate in our study area the dry season and wet season are clearly distinguishable therefore the temporal patterns of both tws and precipitation show high consistency and demonstrate significant seasonal changes the precipitation reaches the maximum monthly average value of 234 mm in july gnss im ewh jim1 ewh and csr ewh reach the maximum monthly average values of 247 mm 209 mm and 130 mm respectively in september the maximum monthly average values of tws lag behind that of precipitation by 2 months which was also found by jiang et al 2021b long et al 2014 and han et al 2019 this time lag may be caused by the complex transportation mechanism of terrestrial water hsu et al 2020 table 2 shows the cc values between the time series of precipitation and various ewh gnss im ewh and jim1 ewh show a stronger correlation with precipitation than csr ewh we also shifted the precipitation time series back by two months and calculated the cc values without time lag table 2 all three types of tws have strong correlations with precipitation with jim1 having the highest correlation the cc values with and without time lag of gnss im and jim1 are greater than those of csr mascon solutions meanwhile gnss im ewh and jim1 ewh increase in december 2013 and january 2015 responding to the heavy precipitation events while those are not found in csr ewh the reason is probably that gnss is sensitive to local tws changes while the spatial resolution of grace grace fo is coarse in addition to precipitation tws changes are also closely related to runoff and evapotranspiration tws is a state quantity and meteorological variables such as precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff are fluxes therefore tws can be simply expressed as the integral of precipitation evapotranspiration runoff p e r over time according to the water balance equation 18 t w s t 0 t p t e t r t d t where t is time p t is precipitation e t is evapotranspiration and r t is runoff eq 18 also can be expressed as d t w s d t p e r we used the p r and e data to verify the reliability of jim1 and revealed the pattern of tws changes in our study area the variable d tws d t represents the central difference at the beginning or end of each month while the variable p e r denotes the monthly average corresponding to the midpoint of the month to ensure temporal consistency between d tws d t and p e r we employed the time series filtering method proposed by landerer et al 2010 to process p e r fig s6 note that we did not filter the precipitation data depicted in figs 7 and 9 as the time of tws coincided with the monthly mean precipitation the filter method is as follows 19 f ˆ t 1 4 f t 1 1 2 f t 1 4 f t 1 where f represents p e or r f ˆ represents filtered estimates fig 8a shows the time patterns of precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff and fig 8b shows the time patterns of d ewh d t and p e r the runoff and evapotranspiration in yunnan show significant seasonal changes and reach their peaks in summer long et al 2014 which is similar to precipitation however the amplitude of the precipitation time series is significantly larger than that of evapotranspiration and runoff indicating that precipitation contributes the most to the tws changes in this region the temporal pattern of d ewh d t is similar to that of p e r but the amplitude of p e r is less than that of jim1 d ewh d t gnss im d ewh d t and csr d ewh d t it suggests that p e r probably underestimates the tws changes we calculated the cc and rmse values between the time series of p e r and d ewh d t inferred from jim1 gnss im and csr mascon solutions table 3 the results show a good consistency between p e r and d ewh d t estimates with all three d ewh d t estimates showing a correlation coefficient above 0 85 furthermore we employed the gtch method to evaluate the uncertainty of p e r and d ewh d t our analysis reveals that the uncertainties of gnss im d ewh d t jim1 d ewh d t csr d ewh d t and p e r are 27 mm 16 mm 22 mm and 26 mm respectively specifically jim1 d ewh d t exhibits the least uncertainty while p e r has a high degree of uncertainty it indicates that jim1 performs better than gnss im and csr mascons the reason for the high uncertainty of p e r may be attributed to its oversimplification of the hydrodynamic process as soil water and deep groundwater variables are disregarded which could lead to an underestimation of tws 4 5 monitoring hydrological drought events drought events have occurred frequently in southwest china causing serious damage to social economic agricultural and ecological balance ding and gao 2020 du et al 2021 ma et al 2017 ma et al 2021 quantitative assessment of hydrological drought events can provide valuable information for local government agencies to develop effective measures and mitigate losses in previous studies gnss and grace grace fo have been applied to monitor hydrological drought events in southwest china jim1 can well integrate the complementary strengths of gnss and grace grace fo data hence we applied the jim1 tws changes to monitor hydrological drought events in yunnan province in hydrology and climatology the anomalies obtained by subtracting the monthly average values of multiple years from the data are often used as the deficit the deficit can be expressed as s i j s j where s represents data series s represents the average value i and j represent the jth month and the ith year fig 9 shows the deficit of precipitation gnss im ewh csr ewh and jim1 ewh in yunnan province although the tws deficits lag behind the precipitation deficit the trend of the precipitation deficit agrees well with that of tws the tws changes show losses during periods characterized by significant precipitation deficit such as the drought period from summer 2011 to spring 2012 and from 2019 to 2020 however we find that the results of gnss and grace grace fo show different temporal characteristics the oscillation amplitude of the gnss deficit is larger than that of the csr deficit the csr deficit diverged significantly from the precipitation deficit and gnss deficit during 09 2016 05 2017 due to the decline in data quality towards the end of the grace mission these differences make it challenging to unify the drought monitoring results from gnss and grace grace fo estimates jim1 can well integrate the gnss and csr observations which is helpful to produce reliable monitoring results for hydrological drought to quantify the hydrological drought events more clearly we calculated the hydrological drought severity index dsi zhao et al 2017 dsi is a normalized anomaly and can be expressed as s i j s j σ j where σ j is the standard deviation of the jth month and s i j s j is the deficits of various ewh to facilitate application of scpdsi in the same drought category as dsi we performed the same normalization for the meteorological drought index scpdsi to obtained the normalized scpdsi nscpdsi then the csr dsi gnss dsi jim1 dsi and nscpdsi were used to analyze the drought events the drought category corresponding to the dsi is shown in tab s3 fig 9a shows the temporal patterns of gnss dsi csr dsi jim1 dsi and nscpdsi and their cc values in yunnan province the cc values indicate hydrological drought indices have strong correlations with nscpdsi according to tab s3 drought events are defined as a dsi value of less than 0 49 thus we show the information of the drought periods when the jim1 dsi is less than 0 49 for three consecutive months table 4 and the drought periods are indicated by shading in fig 9b in the past ten years there have been three significant hydrological drought events in yunnan province which occurred in 08 2011 03 2012 d1 21 2012 03 2013 d2 and 05 2019 12 2020 d3 ma et al 2017 wu et al 2020 and jiang et al 2017 detected events d1 and d2 using grace tws or gps precipitable water vapor the drought event d3 was reported by su and zhan 2022 ding and gao 2020 and du et al 2021 jiang et al 2021b termed j21 in the following investigated these three drought events using gnss im tws the drought event d3 is the most severe lasting for 20 months with a total tws loss of 501 km3 and a peak dsi of 2 5 abnormal drought by comparing the results with j21 tab s4 we find that the total losses of tws and the duration of drought in d1 and d2 are smaller than j21 s results because the jim1 tws changes integrate the spatiotemporal characteristics of gnss im tws and grace grace fo tws note that we did not compare the drought event d3 as it only ended up to 12 2019 in j21 but the drought lasted until 12 2020 some small droughts monitored in j21 are also found in the jim1 dsi for example the jim1 dsi is negative during the 2013 summer drought and the 2015 summer drought but we did not consider them due to their short duration and relatively mild severity 5 discussion 5 1 spatial resolution of two improved joint inversions the tws inferred from gnss im and grace grace fo are suitable for the studies at different spatial scales because of their different spatial resolutions it is necessary to discuss the spatial resolution of jims tws we designed checkerboard tests with two different tws distributions to verify the spatial resolution of the two jims tws these two synthetic tws signals have 0 mm and 400 mm ewh at 2 5 2 5 and 3 5 3 5 grids figs 10a and 10d then the vertical displacements of the gnss stations were calculated using the forward model the vertical displacements of the virtual stations for jim1 were also calculated by the forward model as for jim2 jpl mascon observations were calculated by averaging the original ewh in each equal area 3 degree spherical cap mascon finally the ewh was estimated by the two jims using synthetic gnss and grace grace fo observations figs 10b 10c 10e and 10f figs 10e and 10f show that the two jims tws can recover the 3 5 3 5 distribution of tws across the whole region matching the resolution of grace grace fo furthermore figs 10b and 10c show that the two jims tws estimates have a resolution of 2 5 2 5 in the central areas with dense gnss stations note that the two jims tws estimates cannot be recovered to 2 5 2 5 in areas without gnss stations the results of the checkerboard tests show that the two jims have higher resolutions in the area with dense gnss stations and can obtain the resolution of grace grace fo across the whole study area this capability helps reduce the uncertainty caused by the irregular distribution of gnss stations this conclusion is also drawn from section 4 2 in our jims the grace grace fo observations provide additional constraints across the whole study area while the gnss stations provide higher resolution at their densely distributed local area combining the complementary strengths of the two datasets 5 2 comparison with previous study results to better understand the effects of our proposed two improved jims we compared our results with those of previous studies using grace gnss im and jims in yunnan province overall the spatial distribution patterns of gnss im tws grace tws and jims tws amplitudes exhibit similar characteristics with maximal values in southwestern yunnan and minimal values in northeastern yunnan however in the southwest southeast and north mountains of yunnan the differences between these tws data are found the grace tws amplitude inferred by j21 jiang et al 2017 and fok et al 2019 termed f19 are 200 250 mm 100 150 mm and 100 mm in the southwest southeast and north mountains respectively the j21 and our gnss im yield larger tws amplitudes 300 350 mm 200 250 mm 200 mm in these areas than those of grace grace fo the differences for the southwest and southeast areas could be attributed to the sparse distribution of gnss stations in these areas and the low resolution of grace grace fo conversely we considered gnss im has higher resolution in the north area jiang et al 2017 j21 f19 and we inferred gnss vertical displacements such as ynlj and ynys stations also show large amplitudes in this area which indicated that the local short signal is captured by gnss jim1 jim2 and jim f19 are effective at improving the accuracy of tws estimates in areas with sparse gnss stations the spatial distributions of jim1 tws and jim2 tws have been discussed in section 4 2 furthermore the effects of jims in the united states are similar to that of jim1 and jim2 adusumilli et al 2019 found that the tws estimates inferred from jim have a higher spatial resolution in the northeast southeast and west of the united states where gps stations are densely distributed in contrast in the central united states where gps stations are sparse the jim estimates are closer to grace tws estimates we also find that the amplitude of the area averaged gnss im tws time series is significantly greater than that of grace grace fo the amplitudes of the area averaged grace grace fo tws time series inferred by han et al 2019 j21 and jiang et al 2017 are 120 130 mm while that of gnss im inferred by us and j21 is 160 mm conversely the differences of tws time series between jim1 and grace grace fo are smaller than those of gnss im f19 did not evaluate the difference of tws time series between jim and grace the results of carlson et al 2022 showed that the area average tws time series of different geographic provinces inferred from jim are less different from those of grace which is consistent with the results of jim1 6 conclusion in this study we designed two improved jims to produce optimal tws estimates and focused on comparing the applicability of these two types of jims in southwest china the weighting factors of gnss grace grace fo and prior constraints were determined using the abic method jim1 and jim2 were constrained by grace grace fo derived vertical displacements and equal area 3 degree mascons from jpl respectively then we applied the two jims to estimate monthly time varying tws changes during 01 2011 12 2020 in southwest china allowing us to reveal tws changes characteristics and quantify hydrologic drought events the two jims tws agree well with grace grace fo tws from csr and jpl and gldas tws in the southwestern and southeastern mountains with sparse gnss stations in contrast they demonstrate good agreement with gnss im tws and gldas tws in the northern mountains with dense gnss stations it shows that jim1 and jim2 can integrate the advantages of the spatial sensitivities of gnss and grace grace fo the same conclusion can be reached in the checkerboard test and synthetic test analysis of the cc and rmse of tws temporal patterns between the different solutions indicates that jim2 tws temporal patterns may overfit that of gnss im tws thus we only used jim1 to investigate the tws change characteristics and hydrological drought events combined with meteorological and hydrological data the reliability of jim1 was verified allowing for an analysis of the tws change mechanisms in yunnan province affected by the subtropical monsoon climate precipitation runoff and evapotranspiration all peak in summer the precipitation contributes most to tws changes here with an average amplitude of 234 mm p e r and d tws d t show a strong correlation with jim1 d tws d t showing the lowest uncertainty compared to csr d tws d t gnss im d tws d t and p e r we also investigated the hydrological drought events in yunnan using jim1 tws and found that three large hydrological drought events occurred in yunnan province from 01 2011 12 2020 among them the drought event occurred in 05 2019 12 2020 is the most serious event with a drought duration of 20 months a total deficit of 501 km3 and an exceptional drought category our results show the effects of the two improved jims and provide a new and additional material to study the hydrological cycle mechanisms in the region in addition the two improved jims also can be used to integrate multi source datasets such as gnss grace grace fo and interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar to obtain

7625,study region southwest china study focus terrestrial water storage tws changes estimated from the global navigation satellite system gnss and gravity recovery and climate experiment missions grace grace fo are critical data sets for hydrological studies to obtain a broader and unified spatiotemporal scale than a single method we designed two improved joint inversion methods jims the joint inversion method 1 and 2 jim1 and jim2 are based on grace grace fo derived virtual stations and 3 degree mascons from jet propulsion laboratory respectively we focused on investigating tws changes in southwest china using jim1 and jim2 new hydrological insight for the region the synthetic test showed that jim1 and jim2 had lower root mean square errors than a gnss only inversion method gnss im with reductions of 22 and 37 respectively confirming their feasibility the results of jims using actual gnss and grace grace fo data showed that the area averaged jims tws estimates were consistent with grace grace fo tws and gnss im tws but jim2 tws was overfit to gnss im tws then we utilized jim1 tws to investigate hydro climate relationships and quantify drought events the results revealed a strong agreement between jim1 d tws d t and precipitation evapotranspiration runoff with a correlation coefficient of 0 89 precipitation contributed the most to tws changes furthermore three hydrological drought events were detected with the third event being the most severe lasting for 20 months resulting in a total tws loss of 501 km3 and being categorized as an exceptional drought graphical abstract ga1 keywords terrestrial water storage gnss vertical displacement grace grace fo mascon solutions joint inversion abic data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws an important component of the global water cycle is composed of canopy water glaciers rivers lakes artificial reservoirs soils and groundwater together pokhrel et al 2021 tapley et al 2019 southwest china located in the southeast of the tibetan plateau has a typical subtropical monsoon climate resulting in a strong seasonality in temporal pattern of tws the summer southwest monsoon and east asian monsoon bring a large amount of water vapor from the indian ocean and the pacific ocean supplementing the tws in the form of precipitation and making the tws huge in this region affected by dry monsoons from inland the region becomes relatively dry during winter wang et al 2015 drought events are common in the region when monsoon activities are abnormal ding and gao 2020 han et al 2019 long et al 2014 therefore monitoring tws changes in this region and quantifying tws deficits and hydrological drought events are of great significance for agricultural production socio economic development and revealing local hydrodynamic processes this information is also beneficial for local water government departments to make resource management decisions to estimate the tws changes various hydrological models such as the global land data assimilation system gldas and the water global assessment and prognosis watergap döll et al 2014 döll et al 2003 simulate hydrological processes using mathematical models mo et al 2016 scanlon et al 2019 singh et al 2017 syed et al 2008 these hydrological models generally simplify complex hydrological processes and cannot completely model all water compositions scanlon et al 2018 schumacher et al 2018 soltani et al 2020 soltani et al 2021 space geodetic technologies such as the global navigation satellite system gnss and the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and its successor grace fo provide new tools for estimating tws changes without relying on modeling these technologies provide relatively complete information about water compositions grace grace fo twin satellite gravity missions track monthly earth s gravity field changes with a spatial resolution of 350 km tapley et al 2004 providing a space based technology for studying tws changes schmidt et al 2006 grace grace fo observations are successfully applied to study global and large scale tws changes and extreme hydrological events droughts and floods in brazil goncalves et al 2020 china sun et al 2018 xu et al 2019 africa anyah et al 2018 and the indus basin sinha et al 2019 etc limited by the coarse spatial resolution grace grace fo is sensitive to regional long wavelength signals but difficult to capture local short wavelength signals vertical displacements of gnss networks which record the earth s elastic response caused by hydrological mass changes with millimeter accuracy are sensitive to local short wavelength signals and can also be used to track losses and gains of tws döll et al 2014 the seasonal temporal trend of gnss vertical displacement agrees well with that of grace grace fo inferred tws this makes gnss a useful tool for investigating tws changes extreme hydrological events and global climate changes chew and small 2014 wahr et al 2013 wang et al 2017 previous studies have established a gnss only inversion method gnss im by employing green s function farrell 1972 with the preliminary reference earth model prem this method can invert gnss measured surface movements into high resolution water thickness changes hsu et al 2020 jiang et al 2022 2021a 2021c jin and zhang 2016 gnss is suitable for estimating tws in areas with dense gnss stations it can provide new supplementary data for hydrological studies argus et al 2014 2017 fu et al 2015 to take full advantage of the hydrological models gnss and grace grace fo data researchers have attempted to combine the various data sources to investigate tws changes in terms of assimilating hydrological models and geodetic data yin et al 2020 integrated grace grace fo data and a hydrological model to improve the estimates of groundwater storage changes tangdamrongsub et al 2019 integrated a hydrological model grace grace fo data and gnss data to investigate the surface deformation caused by reservoir impoundment and flood gnss and grace grace fo data are also often used together to analyze tws changes more comprehensively in many studies materna et al 2021 used gnss and grace grace fo data to investigate the seasonal characteristics of hydrological loading in south and southeast asia xue et al 2021 used gnss grace grace fo and land assimilation systems to analyze the surface deformation caused by various water storage changes in the great lakes region of the united states furthermore many researchers have analyzed tws changes in southwest china using grace grace fo and gnss observations long et al 2014 used grace grace fo data to analyze the trend of tws changes and investigate extreme hydrological events in this region wu et al 2020 used grace grace fo data to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of tws deficit in this region and combined meteorological data to analyze the driving factors of hydrological drought jiang et al 2017 used gnss data and grace grace fo data to detect the interannual variations of tws and hydrological drought events in the region they found that gnss vertical displacements will subside if grace grace fo derived tws increases jiang et al 2021b inverted gnss vertical displacements to tws changes and combined grace grace fo and gldas data to analyze the seasonal changes of tws in this area however previous studies have shown that there are differences in the spatial distribution and temporal patterns of tws changes estimated by gnss and grace grace fo in the region which makes it challenging to quantify tws changes by unifying these two geodetic observations the same problem exists in other regions such as california usa argus et al 2014 and the western united states fu et al 2015 the reasons for these differences may be that 1 grace grace fo has a coarser spatial resolution 350 km 2 there is a deterioration in data quality later in the grace mission 3 the signal may be suppressed when removing noise from grace grace fo data 4 there are other unmodeled non hydrologic loading signals such as common mode errors cme ming et al 2016 yuan et al 2018 and draconitic signals fu et al 2015 which are usually difficult to separate from gnss observations completely 5 tws inferred from irregular gnss networks has large uncertainty fok and liu 2019 6 the poroelastic displacements caused by underground water is opposite to the elastic displacements which significantly affect the gnss measured hydrological loading displacements argus et al 2017 7 the inelastic and irreversible compaction of aquifer units caused by groundwater extraction can lead to inelastic surface deformation mirzadeh et al 2021 the joint inversion methods jims developed in previous studies can integrate gnss and grace grace fo observations to produce more accurate tws estimates whereas the applicability of different jims has never been compared these jims can be classified into two types the first method is constrained by grace grace fo derived virtual stations fok and liu 2019 and liu et al 2019 have proposed a jim using vertical displacements from gnss and grace grace fo to improve tws estimations in southwest china however this jim only uses relatively few grace grace fo derived virtual stations in areas with sparse gnss stations it makes the grace grace fo data unable to constrain the tws across the entire region which means that the advantages of the regional long wavelength sensitivity of grace grace fo cannot be fully exploited meanwhile this jim cannot be easily applied to other regions because determining the optimal location and number of virtual stations is challenging the second method is constrained by 2 dimensional operators that can sum or average grace grace fo data adusumilli et al 2019 designed a jim by using a summation operator on grace data and carlson et al 2022 constructed a jim by averaging the equal area 3 degree spherical cap mass concentration blocks mascons of grace grace fo from jet propulsion laboratory jpl the weighting factors are employed to adjust the contributions of gnss vertical displacements grace grace fo observations and laplace smoothing constraint to tws estimates in these two jims these two jims determine the weighting factors using trade off curves or similar methods however it is not easy to choose two optimal weighting factors simultaneously because this method may be subjective and computationally expensive optimal weighting factors are key to jims as suboptimal weighting factors probably lead to increased uncertainty of tws estimates fortunately the akaike s bayesian information criterion abic which has been used to estimate the weighting factors of data in geodetic inversion studies fukahata et al 2004 provides a foundation for the development of jims funning et al 2014 pan et al 2019 yi et al 2017 in this study we aim to improve these two types of jims and compare their effects in southwest china we design two improved jims joint inversion method 1 jim1 and joint inversion method 2 jim2 using grace grace fo derived vertical displacements of virtual stations and equal area 3 degree mascons of grace grace fo from jpl respectively the relative weighting factor between gnss and grace grace fo as well as the smoothing factor of the prior constraint are selected for the two jims using the abic method the grace grace fo virtual stations in jim1 are set to cover the whole region and their number is carefully selected we verify the theoretical validity of the improved jims by using chessboard tests and synthetic tests furthermore by comparing the tws changes estimated by the two improved jims with those from gnss im grace grace fo mascon solutions from the center for space research csr and jpl gldas precipitation and the water balance equation tws p r e precipitation runoff evapotranspiration the actual effectiveness of the two improved jims is verified this analysis also helps to reveal the spatiotemporal characteristics of tws changes in the study area finally we select the tws estimates inferred from the best performing jim to quantify drought events during the period of 01 2011 12 2020 2 data 2 1 gnss data processing we obtained gnss daily time series of 44 stations across southwest china during 01 2011 12 2020 from the china crustal movement observation network cmonoc these data are generated using the gamit globk software the solution strategy for these gnss data is shown in text s1 and provided by the china earthquake data center cedc we removed one station with a low signal to noise ratio and one station with missing data for more than 5 years the remaining 42 stations are shown in fig 1 we only used the vertical displacements of these gnss stations in this study because hydrological mass loading changes have 2 3 times more significant impact on vertical displacements than on horizontal displacements wahr et al 2013 the non hydrological environmental loading effect in the gnss time series was corrected using the non tidal atmospheric loading ntal and non tidal ocean loading ntol displacement products with a sampling interval of 3 h and a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 provided by geoforschungszentrum gfz https www gfz potsdam de en home based on the thermal expansion model proposed by yan et al 2009 the vertical displacements of gnss stations caused by the thermoelastic effect were corrected using daily temperature data with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 provided by the china meteorological administration cma then we modeled the gnss time series and solved for linear seasonal and offset terms of this model using the least squares regression method the gnss time series model is as follows 1 y t i y 0 v 0 t i k 1 2 c k cos 2 k π t i s k sin 2 k π t i j 1 n g j h t i t g j e t i where y 0 is the standard position of the station v 0 is the linear velocity c k and s k are the amplitude of the seasonal terms j 1 n g j h t i t g j is the offset terms since tws changes contribute the most to the seasonal term of gnss vertical displacements we removed the linear and offset terms to obtain the displacements of water mass loading furthermore gnss data gaps are common on account of poor observation conditions and instrument power failures thus the gnss missing data interpolation software gmis liu et al 2018 which integrates the kriging spatial interpolation algorithm and kalman time optimal estimation algorithm was adopted to fill the gnss data gaps gmis can estimate missing gnss data based on the temporal and spatial characteristics of the displacements from the input gnss stations a detailed description of the gmis processing is presented in text s2 to reduce the noise in the gnss time series we employed the independent component analysis ica to filter the seasonal and interannual signals of hydrological loading from gnss vertical displacements the ica method which assumes the components are independent and non gaussian is often used to identify the primary spatial and temporal characteristics of complex data due to the non gaussian probability distribution function of gnss time series ming et al 2016 the ica method is also suitable for separating the clean gnss vertical displacements caused by hydrological loading hsu et al 2020 fig 2 shows the spatial variations and temporal functions of four independent components ics with a total variance reduction of 93 6 the seasonal signal is mainly contained in ic1 and ic2 whose variance contributions to the filtered data are 87 8 and 5 6 the phases of the annual peak for ic1 and ic2 are on the 274th and 180th day of the year respectively indicating that there possibly are multi timescale tws changes in our study area jiang et al 2021b the variance contributions of ic3 and ic4 to the filtered data are 3 8 and 2 8 respectively these ics may be associated with extreme hydrological events for example ic3 shows a decreasing trend during 2015 2018 corresponding to a wet period and ic4 shows an increasing trend during 2019 2020 corresponding to a dry period we calculated the power spectral density function of the unfiltered and filtered gnss vertical displacement time series of which the results for four gnss stations are shown in fig s2 the results show that the annual corresponding to the first peak and semi annual corresponding to the second peak signals of the filtered and unfiltered gnss time series are almost identical this indicates that the processed gnss time series retain the seasonal hydrological signals completely the annual amplitudes of most gnss stations are 6 mm fig s3 revealing the obvious seasonal changes of the hydrological mass in our study area the gnss stations with the largest amplitudes 8 12 mm and the smallest amplitudes 3 5 mm are clustered in the southwestern and northeastern areas respectively this indicates the obvious spatial heterogeneity in tws changes across the study area 2 2 grace grace fo mascon data we also used the grace and grace fo mascon solutions during 01 2011 12 2020 provided by csr https www gfz potsdam de en home and jpl http www2 csr utexas edu grace to obtain monthly tws changes these two products have been widely used in studies investigating regional tws changes sun et al 2018 vishwakarma et al 2021 the mascon solutions estimated by inter satellite range rate measurements provide a better signal to noise ratio compared to spherical harmonics products the c20 and c30 after june 2018 coefficients of these two mascon solutions are replaced by the c20 and c30 solutions from satellite laser ranging slr loomis et al 2019 respectively because the c20 and c30 solutions of slr have smaller uncertainty the degree 1 coefficients geocenter motion of these solutions are corrected by the method proposed by sun et al 2016 and swenson et al 2008 the post glacial rebound is corrected using the ice 6g d model peltier et al 2018 the csr rl06 mascon solutions are estimated as regular hexagonal mass grids at approximately 1 of equatorial longitude and avoid leakage of land signals into the ocean by dividing a grid into two parts at the land sea boundary save et al 2016 the jpl mascon solutions are given as the equal area 3 degree spherical cap mascons and correct the leakage errors using filters at the coastline watkins et al 2015 although these two mascon solutions differ in forms they both have a practical spatial resolution of 350 km determined by the orbital altitude of the grace and grace fo satellites tapley et al 2004 we chose the csr and jpl mascon solutions for jim1 and jim2 respectively theoretically the selection of the mascon solutions has little effect on the results of jims because the spatial and temporal trends of these two mascon solutions are nearly identical figs 5 and 6 2 3 hydrological model in this study the global land data assimilation system gldas model provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https disc gsfc nasa gov was used to validate the jims tws results the gldas noah 2 1 model which is driven by multiple meteorological fields including atmospheric precipitation and radiation fields simulates the monthly hydrological cycle processes rodell et al 2004 this model provides shallow soil water components at a depth of 2 m below the surface snow water equivalent and canopy water it has been widely used to investigate water resources in china bai et al 2016 chen et al 2020 2 4 meteorological and hydrological data and drought index monthly precipitation data were obtained from the cma the noah land surface model of gldas and the fifth generation european reanalysis era5 dataset provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf https cds climate copernicus eu cdsapp home monthly evaporation and runoff data were obtained from the noah clsm and vic land surface models within the gldas framework as well as the era5 dataset the cma dataset employs a grid size of 0 5 0 5 the noah datasets adopt a finer resolution of 0 25 0 25 the clsm and vic datasets employ a grid size of 1 1 the era5 datasets employ a grid size of 0 1 0 1 the generalized three cornered hat gtch method galindo et al 2001 was employed to evaluate the uncertainty of the multiple precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff datasets tab s2 the results show that the precipitation datasets of noah the evapotranspiration data of vic and the runoff data of noah exhibits the least uncertainty we utilized these three datasets to validate our tws results the meteorological drought index was obtained from the monthly self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi at 0 5 0 5 grids provided by the climatic research unit cru of the university of east anglia https research portal uea ac uk en datasets 3 methods 3 1 gnss only inversion method the earth s surface elastic displacements which can be measured with millimeter accuracy by gnss stations capture the hydrological mass changes the surface displacements are determined by the spatial distribution of the loading sources they can be expressed as linear relationships as follows 2 d g x e where x is the mass loading vector d is the loading displacements vector e is the error term and g is the load green s coefficient matrix calculated by the load love numbers wang et al 2012 from the preliminary reference earth model prem dziewonski and anderson 1981 the detailed calculation principle of g can be found in the study of farrell 1972 in this study based on the least squares algorithm the tws changes were estimated as the equivalent water height ewh in grids with an interval of 0 5 0 5 using the gnss vertical displacements caused by hydrological loading since the number of observations of gnss is less than that of the tws estimates a priori laplace spatial smoothing constraint are added to the inversion model the objective function can be minimized as follows tikhonov and arsenin 1977 3 f x σ 1 g x d 2 β 2 l x 2 min which is equivalent to 4 f x g x d t e 1 g x d x t β 2 l t l x e σ 2 where σ is a diagonal matrix whose main diagonal elements are the standard deviations of the vector β is a smoothing factor adjusting the spatial roughness and data fitting and l is a laplace second order smoothing matrix with the template of 0 1 0 1 4 1 0 1 0 which ensures the smoothness of the ewh estimates on the adjacent grids to fit better with the actual spatial distribution of tws once the optimal β ˆ is determined the ewh estimates x ˆ can be found 5 x ˆ g t e 1 g β ˆ l t l 1 g t e 1 d we discuss the selection method of the optimal smoothing factor for gnss im in detail in section 3 3 3 2 joint inversion methods previous studies have shown that there are spatiotemporal differences in gnss im tws and grace grace fo tws in southwest china to combine the strengths of both gnss and grace grace fo there are two main types of jims of gnss and grace data that were developed in previous studies here we improved those jims to design jim1 and jim2 we evaluate the uncertainty of two jims in text s3 note that the method for selecting inversion parameters is detailed in section 3 3 3 2 1 joint inversion method 1 by improving the jim strategy proposed by fok and liu 2019 termed jim f19 we designed jim1 utilizing gnss and grace grace fo derived vertical displacements based on green s function theory firstly we set up virtual observation stations of grace grace fo evenly across the whole study area the vertical displacements of virtual stations were calculated by the grace grace fo mascon solutions from csr using the forward model 5 d g r a c e g r a c e f o g g r a c e g r a c e f o m g r a c e g r a c e f o where d g r a c e g r a c e f o is the grace grace fo derived displacements vector of the vertical stations g g r a c e g r a c e f o is the load green s coefficient matrix corresponding to the virtual stations and m g r a c e g r a c e f o is the grace grace fo mascon solutions matrix corresponding to the grids in our study area secondly determining the location and number of virtual stations is critical for jim1 to determine the most suitable distribution of virtual stations we tested the spatial resolution of the virtual stations based inversion by a chessboard test the checkerboard test is also been often used in previous studies to analyze the resolution of inversions carlson et al 2022 fu et al 2015 the results show that the spatial resolution is close to 3 5 3 5 which matches the original spatial resolution of grace grace fo 350 km when the interval between the virtual stations is set to 2 5 fig s4 since the virtual stations are evenly distributed and have a 2 5 interval which is just smaller than the size of each 3 5 degree mass grid most of the tws signals can be just recovered thus we set the interval of the virtual stations to 2 5 to determine the appropriate number of the virtual stations the spatial distribution of the virtual stations was set as in fig s4 then the vertical displacements of the gnss and virtual stations were used to estimate the tws changes of which the new observations and coefficients matrices are as follows 7 d 1 d g n s s d g r a c e g r a c e f o t g 1 g g n s s g g r a c e g r a c e f o t next the weighting factor α 1 was used to adjust the contributions of these observations to avoid increased uncertainty of tws estimates because gnss and grace grace fo observations are two independent and uncorrelated types of data the variances matrix e α 1 2 of jim1 is as follows 8 e α 1 2 α 1 2 σ g n s s 2 0 0 σ g r a c e g r a c e f o 2 the newly constructed observations matrix coefficients matrix and variances matrix were substituted into the eq 3 the tws estimates of jim1 can be solved as follows 9 x ˆ 1 g 1 t e α ˆ 1 2 1 g 1 β ˆ 1 l t l 1 g 1 t e α ˆ 1 2 1 d 1 finally the time varying estimates of tws were obtained for each epoch using jim1 note that when we executed the jim1 processing the variances matrices σ g n s s and σ g r a c e g r a c e f o were set as unit matrices because the standard deviations of observations of the same type are close jim1 is essentially an improvement over jim f19 which can help to apply jim1 to other regions easier jim f19 only adds grace grace fo virtual stations in areas where gnss stations are sparse and thus grace grace fo data cannot constrain tws estimates for the whole study area it cannot be directly adapted to other regions because determining the optimal location and number of virtual stations is challenging in contrast our jim1 introduces two major advancements firstly virtual observation stations are deployed throughout the entire study area their distribution is adjusted to match to the actual spatial resolution of grace grace fo using a checkboard test this approach facilitates the generalization of jim1 to other regions secondly a weighting factor is introduced to determine the appropriate weighting between gnss and grace grace fo data thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting 3 2 2 joint inversion method 2 the observation vector of jim2 was constructed based on the gnss vertical observations and the equal area 3 degree spherical cap mascons from jpl the observation equation of the jpl mascon in jim2 is 10 s j p l m j p l s j p l x where m j p l is the values of jpl mascon released as 0 5 grids s is the sum operator which can sum all the grid values in each jpl mascon the form of s is 11 s j p l 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 where each row of s j p l corresponds to a jpl mascon the essence of jim2 is to constrain gnss im according to the actual spatial resolution of jpl masocns combining eqs 2 and 10 the observation vector and coefficient matrix of jim2 can be obtained as follows 12 d 2 d g n s s s j p l m j p l t g 2 g g n s s s j p l t similar to jim1 we used the weighting factor α 2 to adjust the relative weighting of gnss and jpl observations aiming to avoid increased uncertainty of tws estimates the variances matrix e α 2 2 and estimates of jim2 are similar to jim1 13 e α 2 2 α 2 2 σ g n s s 2 0 0 σ j p l 2 14 x ˆ 2 g 2 t e α ˆ 2 2 1 g 2 β ˆ 2 l t l 1 g 2 t e α ˆ 2 2 1 d 2 the model of jim2 is based on jim proposed by carlson et al 2022 with our main improvements focused on determining the weighting factors see section 3 3 3 3 abic method for selecting optimal parameters the optimal weighting factors α ˆ and β ˆ are crucial for jims while the inaccurate weighting factors could lead to ineffective jims or make the spatial distribution of the tws estimates differ from the actual one a high α could make the tws estimates overfit to grace grace fo observations but over deviate from gnss observations resulting in a low spatial resolution of the tws estimates conversely a low α value could make the tws estimates overfit to gnss observations furthermore a high β could lead to overly smoothed tws estimates while a low β could produce rough results which are both severely inconsistent with the actual spatial distribution of tws in previous studies of jims adusumilli et al 2019 carlson et al 2022 the trade off curve or similar method hansen and o leary 1993 has been used to determine the weighting factors but it may be subjective and computationally expensive in this study the abic method which has been used to determine weighting factors for geodetic inversions fukahata et al 2004 pan et al 2019 yi et al 2017 was applied to determine the weighting factors α and β simultaneously the abic method uses maximum likelihood estimates to determine the weights of observations and prior constraints in a jim for an earthquake funning et al 2014 it is ultimately expressed as a minimizing abic function as follows 15 abic α 2 β 2 n log f x ˆ log g t e α ˆ 2 1 g β 2 l t l log β 2 l t l log e α ˆ 2 c f x g x d t e α ˆ 2 1 g x d x t β 2 l t l x where n is the number of observations denotes the product of the absolute values of the non zero eigenvalues of the matrix x ˆ is given by eqs 9 and 14 and c is a constant that can be ignored when solving for the optimal weighting factors the corresponding optimal weighting factors α ˆ and β ˆ will be found if the minimum value of abic is searched to improve the search efficiency we used the quasi newton method to search for the minimum value of abic furthermore when the grace grace fo observations are not considered the abic method can also determine the smoothing factor for gnss im in order to search for the optimal weighting factors we applied the two improved jims to the may 2020 dry period when gnss im tws and grace grace fo tws had the largest spatiotemporal differences in our study area the abic distribution of these two improved jims is shown in fig 3 the optimal weighting factors are found when abic 1 obtains the minimum value at log α 2 0 5 log β 2 3 and abic 2 obtains the minimum value at log α 2 6 log β 2 3 fig s5 shows the spatial distribution of gnss im ewh jims ewh and grace grace fo ewh in may 2020 3 4 synthetic test we designed a synthetic test to verify the theoretical feasibility of the two jims the original ewh was derived from the annual amplitude of gldas the synthetic vertical displacements of gnss were computed through the forward model using the original ewh the vertical displacements of virtual stations for jim1 were also derived through the forward model using the original ewh the average values of tws within each equal area 3 degree spherical cap mascon from jpl were utilized as simulated jpl grace grace fo mascon solutions for jim2 to enhance the fidelity of the simulation we introduced the white gaussian noise with standard deviations of 0 8 mm and 15 mm to gnss and grace grace fo observations respectively 3 5 evaluation indicators the correlation coefficient cc and root mean square errors rmse were commonly used in hydrological studies to evaluate the performance of models here we used these two indicators to evaluate the correlation and differences between jims tws gnss im tws grace grace fo tws and gldas tws the cc values with a range of 1 1 can be applied to quantify the correlation between estimates and observations the rmse with a range of 0 is often applied to assess the overall deviations of estimates relative to observations and a small rmse value will be obtained if estimates are close to observations these two indicators are expressed as follows 16 c c i 1 n y i y o i o i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n o i o 2 17 r m s e i 1 n y i o i 2 n where y i is the estimates y is the average value of y i o i is the observation and o is the average value of o i 4 results 4 1 results of synthetic test gnss im jim1 and jim2 were implemented to estimate the tws the results of these three schemes were generally consistent with the spatial distribution of the original ewh figs 4a 4d indicating that these three schemes can recover most of the tws in our study area in addition we calculated the residuals of the two jims to evaluate their precisions figs 4e 4g the rmse values of the two jims ewh are both smaller than those of gnss im the rmse and residuals indicate that both jims tws estimates are more reliable we also find that the smallest residuals of gnss im and jims are located in the center of our study area with dense gnss stations while the largest residuals are located in the surrounding areas with sparse gnss stations the spatial distributions of residuals show that the precisions of these three inversions are largely determined by the density of gnss stations in areas with sparser gnss stations the results may be less accurate however due to constraints of the grace grace fo virtual stations across the whole study area the residuals of jims are smaller than those of gnss im indicating that jims perform better over the whole study area the results of the synthetic test demonstrate the high feasibility of the two jims in our study area 4 2 spatial patterns of annual tws amplitudes the spatial distributions of the annual tws amplitudes inferred from jims gnss im csr and jpl grace grace fo mascon solutions and gldas are shown in fig 5 the greatest annual tws amplitudes of all water products are found in the southwest of our study area conversely the smallest annual tws amplitudes are found in the east of our study area the results of the annual tws amplitudes show that these water products have similar spatial distributions over the whole study area however there are differences in the spatial distribution of gnss im ewh compared to that of the csr and jpl grace grace fo mascon solutions and gldas in some local areas such as positions a b and c gnss im ewh has the largest annual amplitude 280 mm in the southwestern mountains position a while the largest annual amplitudes of csr and jpl grace grace fo ewh and gldas ewh 240 mm 280 mm and 120 mm respectively are located southwest of position a in the southeastern mountains position c there are relatively large annual ewh amplitudes of gnss im but they are not found in the two grace grace fo mascon solutions and gldas the reason is probably that the gnss im ewh in positions a and c has a high level of uncertainty due to the sparse gnss stations fig 1 the gnss im ewh has a relatively large annual amplitude in northern yunnan and southern sichuan position b which can also be found in gldas but not in two grace grace fo mascon solutions the investigations conducted by jiang et al 2017 and jiang et al 2021a 2021b and 2021c have reported large gnss vertical displacements or gnss im ewh annual amplitudes at position b which is consistent with our results while gldas incompletely models all hydrological composition it has a high resolution with the noah model operating at a resolution of 0 25 0 25 thus the slight ewh signal in this local area which is difficult to identify by grace grace fo can be captured by dense gnss stations those results show that the gnss im tws exhibits higher resolution than grace grace fo tws in local areas with dense gnss stations while the grace grace fo results are more reliable in regions with sparse gnss station coverage in terms of jims the spatial distribution characteristics of annual amplitudes for jim1 ewh and jim2 ewh are consistent with those of grace grace fo ewh and gldas ewh at positions a and c the spatial distribution characteristics of ewh amplitudes demonstrate that jim1 and jim2 can improve the accuracy of tws in the areas with sparse gnss stations using the grace grace fo observations in addition the spatial distribution characteristics of annual jims ewh amplitudes are consistent with those of gnss im ewh and gldas ewh at position b retaining the local hydrological signals with high resolution provided by dense gnss stations our results show that the two improved jims integrate the complementary benefits of different spatial scales offered by gnss and grace grace fo we also specifically discuss the spatial resolution of jim1 tws and jim2 tws in section 5 1 which helps to visually understand the effects of jims 4 3 temporal patterns of area averaged tws we compared the temporal patterns of area averaged ewh changes of yunnan province fig 1 inferred from the various data and two jims fig 6 these ewh changes show similar seasonal temporal patterns which reach their minimum and maximum in approximately may and september of each year respectively however the annual amplitude of the gnss im ewh time series is larger than that of grace grace fo and gldas table 1 the annual amplitude of the jim1 ewh time series is between those of grace grace fo ewh and gnss im ewh the amplitude of the jim2 ewh time series is extremely close to that of gnss im ewh we calculated the cc and rmse values between various water products table 1 quantifying the performance of these water products on temporal patterns all cc values are greater than 0 8 showing that the seasonal temporal trends of these water products are similar to each other the cc and rmse values between csr and jpl grace grace fo ewh show that the temporal patterns of these two grace grace fo mascon solutions are almost identical however relatively high rmse values are found between the gnss im ewh and grace grace fo ewh as well as the gnss im ewh and gldas ewh indicating that there are large discrepancies of magnitude between the temporal pattern of gnss im ewh and that of the grace grace fo ewh as well as gldas ewh the discrepancies between the gnss im ewh and grace grace fo ewh may be due to the coarse resolution of grace grace fo unevenly distributed gnss stations fok and liu 2019 non hydrological load signals argus et al 2017 fu et al 2015 etc for the differences between gnss im ewh or grace grace fo ewh and gldas ewh it may be caused by the simplification of the hydrological cycle without considering deep groundwater in the model which could produce underestimated tws results we compared the temporal patterns of the two improved jims ewh to determine the most appropriate jim there are high cc values and low rmse values between jim1 ewh and grace grace fo ewh csr and jpl table 1 which indicates that jim1 reduces the difference of the temporal pattern between grace grace fo ewh and gnss im ewh according to the cc and rmse values between jim1 ewh and gldas ewh we also find that the temporal pattern of jim1 ewh is closer to that of gldas ewh than gnss im ewh jim2 ewh and gnss im ewh have the greatest cc value and smallest rmse value while the cc and rmse values between jim2 ewh and grace grace fo ewh are relatively lower and higher respectively the results of these two jims show that jim1 can better unify the tws temporal pattern between gnss im ewh and grace grace fo ewh while the jim2 tws temporal pattern tends to overfit that of gnss im tws the difference in results between jim1 and jim2 may be caused by the different relative weighting factors α fig 3 thus we only discuss jim1 tws in subsequent sections 4 4 consistency of tws changes with hydrological and climate variables our study area is located in a low latitude zone and the main supply source of tws is precipitation analyzing the relationship between tws changes and precipitation can help reveal the terrestrial water cycle the various ewh and precipitation time series of yunnan province as well as their monthly average values are shown in fig 7 due to the influence of a typical subtropical monsoon climate in our study area the dry season and wet season are clearly distinguishable therefore the temporal patterns of both tws and precipitation show high consistency and demonstrate significant seasonal changes the precipitation reaches the maximum monthly average value of 234 mm in july gnss im ewh jim1 ewh and csr ewh reach the maximum monthly average values of 247 mm 209 mm and 130 mm respectively in september the maximum monthly average values of tws lag behind that of precipitation by 2 months which was also found by jiang et al 2021b long et al 2014 and han et al 2019 this time lag may be caused by the complex transportation mechanism of terrestrial water hsu et al 2020 table 2 shows the cc values between the time series of precipitation and various ewh gnss im ewh and jim1 ewh show a stronger correlation with precipitation than csr ewh we also shifted the precipitation time series back by two months and calculated the cc values without time lag table 2 all three types of tws have strong correlations with precipitation with jim1 having the highest correlation the cc values with and without time lag of gnss im and jim1 are greater than those of csr mascon solutions meanwhile gnss im ewh and jim1 ewh increase in december 2013 and january 2015 responding to the heavy precipitation events while those are not found in csr ewh the reason is probably that gnss is sensitive to local tws changes while the spatial resolution of grace grace fo is coarse in addition to precipitation tws changes are also closely related to runoff and evapotranspiration tws is a state quantity and meteorological variables such as precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff are fluxes therefore tws can be simply expressed as the integral of precipitation evapotranspiration runoff p e r over time according to the water balance equation 18 t w s t 0 t p t e t r t d t where t is time p t is precipitation e t is evapotranspiration and r t is runoff eq 18 also can be expressed as d t w s d t p e r we used the p r and e data to verify the reliability of jim1 and revealed the pattern of tws changes in our study area the variable d tws d t represents the central difference at the beginning or end of each month while the variable p e r denotes the monthly average corresponding to the midpoint of the month to ensure temporal consistency between d tws d t and p e r we employed the time series filtering method proposed by landerer et al 2010 to process p e r fig s6 note that we did not filter the precipitation data depicted in figs 7 and 9 as the time of tws coincided with the monthly mean precipitation the filter method is as follows 19 f ˆ t 1 4 f t 1 1 2 f t 1 4 f t 1 where f represents p e or r f ˆ represents filtered estimates fig 8a shows the time patterns of precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff and fig 8b shows the time patterns of d ewh d t and p e r the runoff and evapotranspiration in yunnan show significant seasonal changes and reach their peaks in summer long et al 2014 which is similar to precipitation however the amplitude of the precipitation time series is significantly larger than that of evapotranspiration and runoff indicating that precipitation contributes the most to the tws changes in this region the temporal pattern of d ewh d t is similar to that of p e r but the amplitude of p e r is less than that of jim1 d ewh d t gnss im d ewh d t and csr d ewh d t it suggests that p e r probably underestimates the tws changes we calculated the cc and rmse values between the time series of p e r and d ewh d t inferred from jim1 gnss im and csr mascon solutions table 3 the results show a good consistency between p e r and d ewh d t estimates with all three d ewh d t estimates showing a correlation coefficient above 0 85 furthermore we employed the gtch method to evaluate the uncertainty of p e r and d ewh d t our analysis reveals that the uncertainties of gnss im d ewh d t jim1 d ewh d t csr d ewh d t and p e r are 27 mm 16 mm 22 mm and 26 mm respectively specifically jim1 d ewh d t exhibits the least uncertainty while p e r has a high degree of uncertainty it indicates that jim1 performs better than gnss im and csr mascons the reason for the high uncertainty of p e r may be attributed to its oversimplification of the hydrodynamic process as soil water and deep groundwater variables are disregarded which could lead to an underestimation of tws 4 5 monitoring hydrological drought events drought events have occurred frequently in southwest china causing serious damage to social economic agricultural and ecological balance ding and gao 2020 du et al 2021 ma et al 2017 ma et al 2021 quantitative assessment of hydrological drought events can provide valuable information for local government agencies to develop effective measures and mitigate losses in previous studies gnss and grace grace fo have been applied to monitor hydrological drought events in southwest china jim1 can well integrate the complementary strengths of gnss and grace grace fo data hence we applied the jim1 tws changes to monitor hydrological drought events in yunnan province in hydrology and climatology the anomalies obtained by subtracting the monthly average values of multiple years from the data are often used as the deficit the deficit can be expressed as s i j s j where s represents data series s represents the average value i and j represent the jth month and the ith year fig 9 shows the deficit of precipitation gnss im ewh csr ewh and jim1 ewh in yunnan province although the tws deficits lag behind the precipitation deficit the trend of the precipitation deficit agrees well with that of tws the tws changes show losses during periods characterized by significant precipitation deficit such as the drought period from summer 2011 to spring 2012 and from 2019 to 2020 however we find that the results of gnss and grace grace fo show different temporal characteristics the oscillation amplitude of the gnss deficit is larger than that of the csr deficit the csr deficit diverged significantly from the precipitation deficit and gnss deficit during 09 2016 05 2017 due to the decline in data quality towards the end of the grace mission these differences make it challenging to unify the drought monitoring results from gnss and grace grace fo estimates jim1 can well integrate the gnss and csr observations which is helpful to produce reliable monitoring results for hydrological drought to quantify the hydrological drought events more clearly we calculated the hydrological drought severity index dsi zhao et al 2017 dsi is a normalized anomaly and can be expressed as s i j s j σ j where σ j is the standard deviation of the jth month and s i j s j is the deficits of various ewh to facilitate application of scpdsi in the same drought category as dsi we performed the same normalization for the meteorological drought index scpdsi to obtained the normalized scpdsi nscpdsi then the csr dsi gnss dsi jim1 dsi and nscpdsi were used to analyze the drought events the drought category corresponding to the dsi is shown in tab s3 fig 9a shows the temporal patterns of gnss dsi csr dsi jim1 dsi and nscpdsi and their cc values in yunnan province the cc values indicate hydrological drought indices have strong correlations with nscpdsi according to tab s3 drought events are defined as a dsi value of less than 0 49 thus we show the information of the drought periods when the jim1 dsi is less than 0 49 for three consecutive months table 4 and the drought periods are indicated by shading in fig 9b in the past ten years there have been three significant hydrological drought events in yunnan province which occurred in 08 2011 03 2012 d1 21 2012 03 2013 d2 and 05 2019 12 2020 d3 ma et al 2017 wu et al 2020 and jiang et al 2017 detected events d1 and d2 using grace tws or gps precipitable water vapor the drought event d3 was reported by su and zhan 2022 ding and gao 2020 and du et al 2021 jiang et al 2021b termed j21 in the following investigated these three drought events using gnss im tws the drought event d3 is the most severe lasting for 20 months with a total tws loss of 501 km3 and a peak dsi of 2 5 abnormal drought by comparing the results with j21 tab s4 we find that the total losses of tws and the duration of drought in d1 and d2 are smaller than j21 s results because the jim1 tws changes integrate the spatiotemporal characteristics of gnss im tws and grace grace fo tws note that we did not compare the drought event d3 as it only ended up to 12 2019 in j21 but the drought lasted until 12 2020 some small droughts monitored in j21 are also found in the jim1 dsi for example the jim1 dsi is negative during the 2013 summer drought and the 2015 summer drought but we did not consider them due to their short duration and relatively mild severity 5 discussion 5 1 spatial resolution of two improved joint inversions the tws inferred from gnss im and grace grace fo are suitable for the studies at different spatial scales because of their different spatial resolutions it is necessary to discuss the spatial resolution of jims tws we designed checkerboard tests with two different tws distributions to verify the spatial resolution of the two jims tws these two synthetic tws signals have 0 mm and 400 mm ewh at 2 5 2 5 and 3 5 3 5 grids figs 10a and 10d then the vertical displacements of the gnss stations were calculated using the forward model the vertical displacements of the virtual stations for jim1 were also calculated by the forward model as for jim2 jpl mascon observations were calculated by averaging the original ewh in each equal area 3 degree spherical cap mascon finally the ewh was estimated by the two jims using synthetic gnss and grace grace fo observations figs 10b 10c 10e and 10f figs 10e and 10f show that the two jims tws can recover the 3 5 3 5 distribution of tws across the whole region matching the resolution of grace grace fo furthermore figs 10b and 10c show that the two jims tws estimates have a resolution of 2 5 2 5 in the central areas with dense gnss stations note that the two jims tws estimates cannot be recovered to 2 5 2 5 in areas without gnss stations the results of the checkerboard tests show that the two jims have higher resolutions in the area with dense gnss stations and can obtain the resolution of grace grace fo across the whole study area this capability helps reduce the uncertainty caused by the irregular distribution of gnss stations this conclusion is also drawn from section 4 2 in our jims the grace grace fo observations provide additional constraints across the whole study area while the gnss stations provide higher resolution at their densely distributed local area combining the complementary strengths of the two datasets 5 2 comparison with previous study results to better understand the effects of our proposed two improved jims we compared our results with those of previous studies using grace gnss im and jims in yunnan province overall the spatial distribution patterns of gnss im tws grace tws and jims tws amplitudes exhibit similar characteristics with maximal values in southwestern yunnan and minimal values in northeastern yunnan however in the southwest southeast and north mountains of yunnan the differences between these tws data are found the grace tws amplitude inferred by j21 jiang et al 2017 and fok et al 2019 termed f19 are 200 250 mm 100 150 mm and 100 mm in the southwest southeast and north mountains respectively the j21 and our gnss im yield larger tws amplitudes 300 350 mm 200 250 mm 200 mm in these areas than those of grace grace fo the differences for the southwest and southeast areas could be attributed to the sparse distribution of gnss stations in these areas and the low resolution of grace grace fo conversely we considered gnss im has higher resolution in the north area jiang et al 2017 j21 f19 and we inferred gnss vertical displacements such as ynlj and ynys stations also show large amplitudes in this area which indicated that the local short signal is captured by gnss jim1 jim2 and jim f19 are effective at improving the accuracy of tws estimates in areas with sparse gnss stations the spatial distributions of jim1 tws and jim2 tws have been discussed in section 4 2 furthermore the effects of jims in the united states are similar to that of jim1 and jim2 adusumilli et al 2019 found that the tws estimates inferred from jim have a higher spatial resolution in the northeast southeast and west of the united states where gps stations are densely distributed in contrast in the central united states where gps stations are sparse the jim estimates are closer to grace tws estimates we also find that the amplitude of the area averaged gnss im tws time series is significantly greater than that of grace grace fo the amplitudes of the area averaged grace grace fo tws time series inferred by han et al 2019 j21 and jiang et al 2017 are 120 130 mm while that of gnss im inferred by us and j21 is 160 mm conversely the differences of tws time series between jim1 and grace grace fo are smaller than those of gnss im f19 did not evaluate the difference of tws time series between jim and grace the results of carlson et al 2022 showed that the area average tws time series of different geographic provinces inferred from jim are less different from those of grace which is consistent with the results of jim1 6 conclusion in this study we designed two improved jims to produce optimal tws estimates and focused on comparing the applicability of these two types of jims in southwest china the weighting factors of gnss grace grace fo and prior constraints were determined using the abic method jim1 and jim2 were constrained by grace grace fo derived vertical displacements and equal area 3 degree mascons from jpl respectively then we applied the two jims to estimate monthly time varying tws changes during 01 2011 12 2020 in southwest china allowing us to reveal tws changes characteristics and quantify hydrologic drought events the two jims tws agree well with grace grace fo tws from csr and jpl and gldas tws in the southwestern and southeastern mountains with sparse gnss stations in contrast they demonstrate good agreement with gnss im tws and gldas tws in the northern mountains with dense gnss stations it shows that jim1 and jim2 can integrate the advantages of the spatial sensitivities of gnss and grace grace fo the same conclusion can be reached in the checkerboard test and synthetic test analysis of the cc and rmse of tws temporal patterns between the different solutions indicates that jim2 tws temporal patterns may overfit that of gnss im tws thus we only used jim1 to investigate the tws change characteristics and hydrological drought events combined with meteorological and hydrological data the reliability of jim1 was verified allowing for an analysis of the tws change mechanisms in yunnan province affected by the subtropical monsoon climate precipitation runoff and evapotranspiration all peak in summer the precipitation contributes most to tws changes here with an average amplitude of 234 mm p e r and d tws d t show a strong correlation with jim1 d tws d t showing the lowest uncertainty compared to csr d tws d t gnss im d tws d t and p e r we also investigated the hydrological drought events in yunnan using jim1 tws and found that three large hydrological drought events occurred in yunnan province from 01 2011 12 2020 among them the drought event occurred in 05 2019 12 2020 is the most serious event with a drought duration of 20 months a total deficit of 501 km3 and an exceptional drought category our results show the effects of the two improved jims and provide a new and additional material to study the hydrological cycle mechanisms in the region in addition the two improved jims also can be used to integrate multi source datasets such as gnss grace grace fo and interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar to obtain more accurate tws estimates in the future credit authorship contribution statement xinghai yang conceptualization methodology software writing original draft preparation linguo yuan supervision

7626,study region the source area of the yellow river sayr located in the northeastern part of the qinghai tibet plateau china study focus this study attempts to produce the quantity duration frequency qdf relationships of lowflow through a nonstationary approach of the generalized extreme value gev models detailed derivation of theoretical model of different structures and parameter estimation is presented as the central part followed by model evaluation and recommendation time and two climate indices i e arctic oscillation ao and eastern asia ea are selected as covariates new hydrological insights for the region for the sayr nonstationary gev models incorporating additional climate informed covariates show apparent strengths over stationary gev model using ao and ea as covariates dual covariate model has not shown apparent advantages over single covariate model the introduction of climate indices as critical covariates in addition to time is found to be a good choice in the construction of nonstationary gev models for obtaining the qdf relationships and analyzing multivariate properties of lowflow the results could help to guide the emergency management and regulation of water resources during the lowflow season and to assistant the design of water engineering for the future period graphical abstract ga1 keywords lowflow nonstationary gev model climatic covariate qdf relationship yellow river data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the combined influence of climate change and intensive human activities have significantly altered the global water cycling processes in recent decades gudmundsson et al 2021 cooley et al 2021 as the observed time series increasingly show nonstationary characteristics the stationarity assumption of hydrological frequency analysis under changing environments is facing greater challenges tan et al 2020 milly et al 2015 argued that the assumption of stationarity in a changing environment is no longer applicable to risk assessment of water resources based on which the current approaches would produce deviated results failing to reflect the actual situations for instance the nonstationarity of runoff and streamflow originating from extreme rainfall processes should be reasonably addressed with advances in climate change research the studies on nonstationarity of hydrological processes from the perspective of climatic factors have gained growing attention such as focusing on the nonstationary characteristic of extreme rainfall flood and drought events in particular the generalized extreme value gev distribution that unifies the weibull gumbel and frechet distributions kotz and nadarajah 2000 has been widely used for frequency analysis of hydrological extremes in the context of univariate analysis the gev distribution shows good performance in extreme rainfall probability distribution selection ballarin et al 2022 for both historical observations and future projections at various temporal scales from sub hourly to annual qin and dai 2022 das et al 2022 musara et al 2022 meanwhile the gev distribution is also applied for site and regional flood frequency analysis kebebew and awass 2022 lescesen et al 2022 forecasting steirou et al 2022 modeling and projection ossandon et al 2022 etc on the other hand the intensity duration frequency idf curves based on the gev distribution are considered useful tools for multivariate frequency analysis of extreme rainfall events roksvag et al 2021 kourtis et al 2022 which may help to improve the understanding of the influence of climate change on heavy rainfalls and reduce the consequential multidimensional risks zhao et al 2022 likewise the severity duration frequency sdf curves have been developed for meteorological sahana et al 2020 kumar et al 2021 hydrological streamflow sung and chung 2014 razmkhah 2017 agricultural samantaray et al 2019 and ecological halwatura et al 2015 droughts using the threshold level and copula based methods nevertheless the above literature is generally in the background of consistent circumstances e g use of the stationary gev model regardless of the pronounced nonstationarity of hydro meteorological processes to cope with the overwhelming increase and variation in extreme rainfall events the updated time varying idf curves are developed for the design and management of water resource infrastructure vinnarasi and dhanya 2021 gao et al 2022 for example hajani 2022 investigated the possible impacts of climate change and multi decadal climate variability on rainfall extremes and obtained the new idf curves coupling both stationary and nonstationary gev distributions moreover the gev distribution is also tested for flood frequency analysis with nonstationary data series in regulated catchments gruss et al 2022 these attempts suggest that the nonstationary gev model has desirable potentiality in dealing with hydrological extreme events e g rainfall and can be helpful for frequency analysis of hydrological processes losing stationarity under changing environments rainfall and flood extremes have been extensively investigated and discussed whereas dry season water cycling has not yet drawn enough attention in fact the dry season as a period of more problems in water resources water ecology and water environment is susceptible to the impact of natural and social systems on the water discharge processes although the negative anomalies in streamflow sequences have been a concern by streamflow drought analyses the focus is essentially on the abnormal phenomenon of less streamflow even in wet seasons rather than on the extremely low river flow i e lowflow of different durations in the dry season furthermore the sdf curves of drought events are basically based on the stationary model which needs to define drought characteristics severity and duration with a calculated drought index before obtaining the multivariate probabilistic relationship of sdf sung and chung 2014 kumar et al 2021 at present most nonstationary models e g gev developed for hydrological extremes only use time as a covariate to construct statistical distribution models with time varying parameters the problem is that these models lack the necessary physical bases and cannot effectively reflect the nonstationary impacts of the external environment such as climate factors on model parameters ouarda et al 2019 vinnarasi and dhanya 2021 some climate informed covariates were introduced in previously developed time varying idf curves of extreme rainfall e g ouarda et al 2019 however more efforts and improvements are still needed with respect to the selection of covariates derivation of theoretical models and parameter estimation evaluation and application of different models etc analogous to the idf curves used for rainfall the current study attempts to produce a lowflow quantity duration frequency qdf relationship through a nonstationary approach of the gev models using time and macroscale climate indices as covariates the study domain is the source area of the yellow river sayr where the anthropogenic influences are not far reaching and the reduction of lowflow is mainly caused by climatic warming xu et al 2022 ma et al 2021 up to now few studies have been reported on the application of nonstationary gev models to lowflow and none on the incorporation of climate factors for relevant analyses in the sayr the objectives of this study are to develop nonstationary gev models with climate informed covariates in addition to time using annual least lowflow discharge of different durations and monthly time series of climate indices and to establish the qdf relationships of lowflow in the sayr through assessment of proposed nonstationary gev models with different combinations of time and or climatic covariates the layout of the remainder of this article is as follows section 2 describes informative details about the materials and methods and section 3 presents the results mainly shown in terms of illustrations afterwards relevant discussion is provided in section 4 before the conclusions are finally summarized in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the source area of the yellow river sayr is located in the northeastern part of the qinghai tibet plateau covering the yellow river basin yrb above longyangxia reservoir and the catchment area drained at tangnaihai gauge 100 09 e 35 30 n is 122 000 km2 about 16 of the yrb the location of the sayr and tangnaihai gauge is shown in fig 1 the sayr belongs to a continental plateau climate category with an annual average precipitation of about 488 mm while the annual average runoff is about 20 billion m3 accounting for 35 of the whole yrb the topography of the sayr is dominated by mountains hills and basins mainly covered by grasslands water bodies and permanent wetlands where the ecological environment is relatively fragile and slight changes in climate may cause considerable responses ma et al 2023 meanwhile because of its location on the westernmost edge of the east asian monsoon region the stress and position of the subtropical anticyclone over the western pacific would lead to large uncertainties in the regional moisture supply from the southeastern warm and humid atmospheric circulation thus the precipitation of the sayr shows apparent oscillations at both interannual and seasonal time scales besides the sayr has been affected by natural erosions and human activities over a long time which intensifies its ecological problems such as soil erosion and grassland degradation the water resource and eco environmental protection of the sayr play a key role in the sustainability of the entire yrb the flood season of the yrb starts no earlier than april and ends no later than october moreover the proportion of river flow of the sayr in december january and february is also very low therefore the period from november to april is considered to define the lowflow season of the sayr in this study specifically using the observed daily streamflow of the tangnaihai gauge from 1957 to 2018 the datasets of annual least volumetric quantity q of lowflow discharge corresponding to seven representative durations d i e 1 day 3 day 7 day 15 day 30 day 60 day and 90 day are constructed as the input to the development of multivariate probabilistic models integrating nonstationary quantity duration frequency qdf relationships of lowflow in the sayr considering the impact of climate oscillations on river flow nonstationarity of different durations in this study up to 26 macroscale climate indices see table s1 for more details are considered to examine the teleconnections between climate oscillation and lowflow discharge of the sayr these data are monthly atmospheric and oceanic time series of climate indices from the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa http www esrl noaa gov psd data climateindices list 2 2 detection of nonstationarity in this study the smooth processing i e moving average and the mann kendall m k test are conducted for trend and mutation analyses with respect to the nonstationarity in preprocessed lowflow discharge time series of the sayr from 1957 to 2018 2 2 1 the smooth processing the moving average is mostly used in trend analysis which can reduce the randomness of the tested sequence while highlighting its changing trend to this end a five year moving average transform is performed for trend analysis as follows 1 y t 1 2 k 1 i 0 2 k x t i where y t is the smoothed sequence after moving average and x t is the original sequence i 0 1 2 k represents moving steps within a certain time window and k 2 determines a specific time window of five years 2 2 2 the mann kendall test as a nonparametric tool the mann kendall test which is basically not affected by outliers is preferable for mutation analysis specifically for an original sequence x with a sample size of n construct a new ordered sequence of s k and calculate the following statistics mann 1945 kendall 1975 2 s k i 1 k r i k 2 3 n 3 u f k s k e s k var s k where r i 1 x i x j 0 x i x j 1 j i e s k and var s k are the mean and variance of s k respectively and uf 1 0 arrange the sequence x in a reversed order and let ub k uf k k n n 1 1 given a significance level of α 0 05 uf k 1 96 indicates a significant trend of change in the original sequence x and the intersection of ub k and uf k within the confidence interval means a mutation point accordingly 2 3 selection of climate indices the measurement for correlation analysis i e spearman s nonlinear rank correlation coefficient ρ is calculated to assure the teleconnections between lowflow discharge and climate indices thus the large scale climate indices having the highest correlation with lowflow discharge are selected as climatic covariates for deriving time varying parameters to construct the nonstationary gev models for pairwise elements usually in terms of two column vectors of x n and y n where n is the length of each column the correlation coefficient can be obtained as hollander and wolfe 1973 4 ρ n 12 n n 1 n 1 i 1 n r i s i 3 n 1 n 1 where r i and s i are the ranks of the two columns i e the order of sample data x i and y i in x 1 x n and y 1 y n respectively considering the possible connection between lowflow discharge and climate indices with different time lags lowflow discharge relative to climate indices this study analyzes the correlation between lowflow quantity q and averaged climate indices of consecutive 1 6 months sliding step 1 2 3 4 5 6 months for preceding 0 5 years time lag 0 1 2 3 4 5 years while 0 year time lag indicating the concurrent year the time series of climate indices having the highest correlation with lowflow discharge are adopted as selected covariates in the construction of nonstationary gev models allowing the formulation of time varying parameters 2 4 derivation of the nonstationary gev model 2 4 1 the stationary gev model the stationary gev model is based on the generalized extreme value distribution according to the theory of extreme value the gev distribution can be expressed as the following three parameter distribution function kotz and nadarajah 2000 5 f x p x x exp 1 κ x μ σ 1 κ where x denotes a random variable following the gev distribution μ and σ are the location and scale parameters respectively κ is the shape parameter generally assumed to be constant for a given frequency p by solving p f x p the corresponding quantile design value x p can be derived as 6 x p μ σ κ 1 ln p κ for each given duration d i i 1 2 m the annual series of corresponding lowest quantity of river discharge q j d j 1 2 n can be constructed in order to define the lowflow quantity duration frequency qdf relationships where m stands for the groups of selected durations and n is the length of studied years in the stationary gev model assuming that the lowflow quantity q of each duration has a gev distribution function as eq 5 the corresponding frequency p and return period t can be related as 7 t 1 1 p x x p 1 p x x p through mathematical derivation the defined qdf relationship of lowflow using the stationary gev model can be finally obtained as ouarda et al 2019 8 q t d a t b d μ σ κ 1 ln 1 t κ d θ η where b d d θ η θ and η are shape parameters of the stationary gev model usually assumed to be constants thus b d can be regarded as a constant as a whole if the probability distribution function of q d is f q d q d then x q d b d also follows the same gev distribution i e f q d q d f x x t 1 t then a t can be represented as 9 a t f x 1 1 t μ σ κ 1 ln 1 t κ 2 4 2 the nonstationary gev model the nonstationarity of the gev model lies largely in that the parameters μ and σ are no longer constants but variables depending on covariates under nonstationary conditions the gev distribution function can be rewritten as 10 f x exp 1 κ x μ t σ t 1 κ where μ t and σ t are the location and scale parameters dependent on covariates respectively κ is the shape parameter still assumed to be a constant since the parameters μ and σ in the stationary gev model become covariate dependent parameters μ t and σ t the qdf relationship of lowflow based on the nonstationary gev model accordingly turns out to be 11 q t d μ t σ t κ 1 ln 1 t κ d θ η it should be noted that the dependence of μ t and σ t on covariates may have different forms so as to obtain the best fitted model when considering nonstationary properties the dependence of model parameters on covariates is generally subject to linear y a bx or quadratic y a bx c x 2 meanwhile regarding the number of covariates only one covariate and two covariate models are considered in this study that is either time or climate index ci is used as a single covariate whereas the combination of time ci or ci ci is set as dual covariates 2 4 2 1 single covariate model using only time or ci as a covariate the single covariate nonstationary gev models include time covariate gev time and ci covariate gev ci considering the forms of parameter dependence linear and quadratic and using y t to represent the covariate the parameters μ t and σ t of nonstationary gev distribution can be expressed as 12 μ t μ 0 μ 0 μ 1 y t μ 0 μ 1 y t μ 2 y t 2 13 σ t σ 0 σ 0 σ 1 y t when the location parameter μ t μ 0 and scale parameter σ t σ 0 it becomes the stationary gev model the dependence of location parameter μ t on the covariate y t can be linear or quadratic and only linear dependence of scale parameter σ t on the covariate y t is considered thus the single covariate nonstationary gev model has five specific expressions according to different forms of parameter dependence the structure and parameter composition of each model are systematically presented in table 1 2 4 2 2 dual covariate model using time and ci as two covariates the dual covariate nonstationary gev models include time ci covariates gev time ci and ci ci covariates gev ci ci considering the forms of parameter dependence linear and quadratic and using y t and z t to represent the two covariates the parameters μ t and σ t of nonstationary gev distribution are given as 14 μ t μ 0 μ 1 y t μ 2 z t μ 0 μ 1 y t μ 2 y t 2 μ 3 z t μ 0 μ 1 y t μ 2 z t μ 3 z t 2 μ 0 μ 1 y t μ 2 y t 2 μ 3 z t μ 4 z t 2 15 σ t σ 0 with two covariates and quadratic dependence the specific forms of the location parameter μ t may become quite complicated in this study only the case of constant scale parameter σ t σ 0 is considered for brevity accordingly the dual covariate nonstationary gev model has four specific expressions with the derived structure and parameter composition of each model explicitly shown in table 2 2 5 estimation of model parameters 2 5 1 the maximum likelihood approach the maximum likelihood method is further developed to estimate the parameters in proposed nonstationary gev models of different complexity e g single covariate or dual covariate linear or quadratic dependence on covariate for the sayr in consideration of nonstationarity the location and scale parameters of gev distribution become covariate dependent variables i e μ t and σ t instead of μ and σ according to section 2 4 1 the lowflow quantity of different durations q d and x q d b d share the following gev distribution function f x x modified from eq 10 under nonstationary conditions 16 f x x exp 1 κ x d θ η μ t σ t 1 κ where x is an independent variable denoting the lowflow quantity q and d is a constant for a given duration d for single covariate nonstationary gev model the probability distribution function f q q of lowflow quantity q has five specific forms see the last column of table 1 similarly for dual covariate nonstationary gev model the probability distribution function f q q has four specific forms see the last column of table 2 then the probability density function of lowflow quantity q can be obtained by taking the first order derivation of eq 16 as follows 17 f q d θ η σ t 1 κ q d θ η μ t σ t 1 κ 1 exp 1 κ q d θ η μ t σ t 1 κ let f q 1 q 2 q m ψ t be the joint probability density function of lowflow quantity of different durations q d 1 q d 2 q d m and the likelihood function can be further obtained as 18 l ψ t q 1 q 2 q m j 1 n f q j 1 q j 2 q jm ψ t where q is the sample value of lowflow quantity q q jm represents the lowflow quantity of the j th year for the m th duarion ψ t stands for the set of parameters to be estimated assuming the lowflow quantity of different durations q d i i 1 2 m are independent with each other and have the same class of probability distribution i e gev distribution then the likelihood function can be simplified as 19 l ψ t q j 1 n i 1 m f q ji ψ t to facilitate the optimization of parameters a sum function is finally constructed by taking the logarithm of both sides of eq 19 20 l f ψ t q ln j 1 n i 1 m f q ji ψ t j 1 n i 1 m ln f q ji ψ t in this study the interior point algorithm with nonlinear and bound constraints is used for model parameter optimization byrd et al 1999 the first derivative of the proposed objective function iterates from a given initial point and gradually converges to the possible optimal solution the interior point approach to constrained minimization aims to obtain the parameters when the objective function achieves the minimum value in the nonlinear programming let the objective function be fun l f ψ t q where the set of parameters ψ t can be estimated by solving a sequence of approximate minimization problems 2 5 2 single covariate model for single covariate nonstationary gev model the dependence of location and scale parameters μ t and σ t on the covariate time or ci may have various forms and the covariate y t can be time of year or a certain ci the procedure of estimating model parameters using above maximum likelihood method is as follows first according to the specific model structure and probability distribution function f q q ψ t of lowflow quantity q see table 1 take the first order derivative of q and obtain corresponding probability density function f q ψ t as given by eq 17 then construct the log likelihood function l f ψ t q on the basis of eqs 18 to 20 finally give the initial values of parameter estimates and optimize model parameters through the optimization tool i e to find the parameter composition ψ ˆ t see the third column of table 1 that maximizes the log likelihood function l f ψ t q 2 5 3 dual covariate model for dual covariate nonstationary gev model the forms of location and scale parameters μ t and σ t dependent on covariates time and ci are also diverse given the scale parameter σ t as a constant σ t σ 0 the covariate y t represents time of year or a certain ci and the other covariate z t denotes another ci similarly the following procedure for model parameter estimation based on the maximum likelihood method is applicable first with a specific model structure and probability distribution function f q q ψ t of lowflow quantity q see table 2 take the first order derivative of q and obtain the corresponding probability density function f q ψ t then establish the log likelihood function l f ψ t q finally estimate and optimize model parameters through iteration from given initial values finding the parameter composition ψ ˆ t see the third column of table 2 that maximizes the log likelihood function l f ψ t q 2 6 criteria of goodness of fit to balance the number of parameters and the maximized log likelihood of proposed nonstationary gev models the akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic are adopted for assessing the goodness of fit box et al 1994 21 aic 2 l f ψ ˆ t q 2 k 22 bic 2 l f ψ ˆ t q ln n k where k is the number of model parameters n is the sample size 2 k and ln n k are the penalty terms the minimum values of aic and or bic indicate the best fitness between empirical points and the theoretical model 3 results 3 1 the nonstationarity of lowflow discharge unsurprisingly the observed lowflow discharge of the sayr for all analyzed durations of 1 90 days during 1957 2018 shows apparent nonstationarity illustrated in fig 2 as can be seen the trend in annual least lowflow discharge of different durations e g 7d is further manifested by the smoothed evolution of the five year moving average and relevant linear trendlines although the fluctuation of lowflow discharge bottoming in the early 2000s seems to be out of order the five year moving average makes its upward and downward tendencies clearer meanwhile the multi stage trend in lowflow discharge is identified through linear regression specifically the 1 day 3 day 7 day 15 day 30 day 60 day and 90 day lowest streamflow generally increased from the 1950s to the mid 1980s and decreased afterward until another drastic rise occurred at around the mid 2000s and maintained ever since the multi stage trend and mutation points of lowflow discharge using the mann kendall test are also demonstrated in fig 2 on the one hand the calculated statistic uf confirms the three stage trend in lowflow discharge of different durations during the period of 1957 2018 in particular the rising trend from the 1950s to the mid 1980s is statistically significant α 0 05 while the values of the statistic uf are beyond the threshold value of 1 96 furthermore the two mutation points at around the mid 1980s and late 2000s indicated by the intersection of statistics uf and ub are both statistically significant within the confidence interval therefore the above analyses support the nonstationarity in lowflow discharge and suggest the necessity of developing nonstationary models to analyze its probabilistic properties 3 2 the selected climate indices as covariates the individual correlation between monthly atmospheric and oceanic time series of 26 climate indices listed in table s1 with lowflow discharge of different durations is checked in fact the spearman s correlation coefficients between lowflow discharge of different durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days and averaged climate indices sliding step 1 2 3 4 5 6 months of preceding five years time lag 0 1 2 3 4 5 years are computed for comparative purposes from the results two preferable climate indices i e arctic oscillation ao and eastern asia ea yielding relatively higher correlation coefficients are filtered out and systematically illustrated in figs 3 and 4 as can be seen from fig 3 for lowflow discharge and averaged ao of the same year time lag 0 year spearman s correlation coefficients can be positive or negative but all close to zero suggesting negligible correlations however for time lags of 1 and 2 years the correlation coefficients are predominantly positive with negative values close to zero in particular the 1 month ao with a 2 year time lag yields the highest positive correlation coefficients for the lowflow discharge of all durations moreover for time lags of longer than three years most of the correlation coefficients are negative and relatively noticeable in a few cases e g 5 month sliding step and 3 year time lag by contrast the correlation coefficients between lowflow discharge and averaged ea fig 4 are mainly negative except for the cases with a time lag of 4 years especially the ea of 1 month sliding step with a 0 year time lag has the highest negative correlation coefficients regarding the lowflow discharge of all durations according to above results the time series of 1 month ao 2 year time lag and ea 0 year time lag are finally adopted as covariates apart from the time of year i e 1957 1958 2018 to construct nonstationary gev models aiming to investigate the lowflow discharge of various durations 3 3 development of the nonstationary gev model 3 3 1 model construction and parameter estimation following the derivation of theoretical models and parameter estimation presented in sections 2 4 and 2 5 respectively the nonstationary gev models of different structures using time and or climate indices ao and ea as a single or dual covariate are analytically constructed for whom the set of parameters is also obtained through optimization algorithm as a contrast the stationary gev model is also considered at the same time for the lowflow discharge of each duration d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 the stationary and nonstationary gev models are individually built and the finalized parameters of all models are provided in tables s2 to s8 as can be seen apart from the constant parameters κ θ and η the time varying parameters μ t and σ t dependent on covariate indicated by y t or z t combinations of time ci time ci and ci ci are also derived by giving the linear and quadratic dependence coefficients of μ 0 μ 1 μ 2 μ 3 μ 4 and σ 0 σ 1 using the estimates of all these parameters the complete analytic expressions of the nonstationary gev models as the form of eq 11 that bridges the qdf relationship of lowflow could be readily formulated in other words the five and four specific qdf relationships of lowflow using single and dual covariate nonstationary gev models given by the first columns of tables 1 and 2 respectively all become addressable 3 3 2 model evaluation in addition to the log likelihood the aic and bic criteria incorporating penalties regarding the number of model parameters and sample size can help to identify the best fitted one out of more than 20 stationary and nonstationary gev models for the lowflow discharge of each duration d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days the log likelihood the number of parameters and goodness of fit criteria i e aic and bic of the stationary and all nonstationary single and dual covariate gev models are demonstrated in tables s2 s8 as is shown for all considered durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days the best fitted single covariate model is with no exception the gev ao model having the least six parameters of κ θ η μ 0 μ 1 and σ 0 amongst the many models of different structures covariates gev time gev ao and gev ea and parameter compositions 6 8 parameters as indicated in table 1 similarly the best fitted dual covariate model for all analyzed durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days is the gev ao ea model with the least seven parameters of κ θ η μ 0 μ 1 μ 2 and σ 0 out of the many models of different structures covariates gev time ao gev time ea and gev ao ea and parameter compositions 7 9 parameters as presented in table 2 on that basis the stationary and best fitted single and dual covariate gev models for each duration d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days are further compared in table 3 it is found that the single covariate gev ao model is the optimal gev model for short durations d 1 3 7 days according to both aic and bic in contrast for longer durations d 15 30 60 90 days the optimal gev model turns out to be the dual covariate gev ao ea model based on the aic values however in terms of bic that additionally considers the sample size the gev ao model would be optimal for all analyzed durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days at the same time the nonstationary gev ao and gev ao ea models seem to outdistance the stationary gev model gev stationary with overwhelming preference yielding larger log likelihood but smaller aic and bic values for thorough and more systematic comparisons the gev stationary gev ao and gev ao ea models with respect to lowflow discharge of seven durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days are performed using the estimated model parameters provided in table 3 3 3 3 model performance and recommendation the performance of the gev stationary gev ao and gev ao ea models for each duration d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days is illustrated and compared in fig 5 as can be seen the annual least volumetric quantity q of lowflow discharge during 1957 2018 for all seven analyzed durations basically falls between the frequencies of 2 and 98 derived from the gev stationary gev ao and gev ao ea models the difference lies in that the gev stationary model can only provide constant quantiles whereas the gev ao and gev ao ea models are able to generate quantiles varying in different years as a result the gev stationary model produces three straight lines representing frequencies of 2 50 and 98 that fail to match well with the empirical points of annual least lowflow discharge in comparison the fluctuated variations of computed quantiles corresponding to theoretical frequencies based on the gev ao and gev ao ea models tend to be generally more in agreement with the empirical points as an example table 4 compares the designed annual least lowflow discharge with 50 frequency 2 year return period using different gev models it is seen that the gev stationary model outputs specific design values whereas the gev ao and gev ao ea models are capable of providing interval estimates of designed lowflow discharge moreover the design values given by the gev stationary model are all included in the intervals derived from the gev ao and gev ao ea models one would also notice the considerable gap between the lower limit of interval and the constant design value while the former might help to make more cautious strategies of water resources management when facing more severe situations therefore the single covariate gev ao and dual covariate gev ao ea models are recommended to investigate multivariate probabilistic properties of lowflow through proposed nonstationary qdf relationships 3 4 the nonstationary multivariate probabilistic properties of lowflow 3 4 1 the nonstationary qdf relationship using single covariate gev ao model using the best fitted single covariate model i e gev ao the nonstationary quantity duration frequency qdf relationships of lowflow in the sayr for all analyzed durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days are first visualized through the three dimensional scatter diagram of fig 6 it is clearly seen that the empirical points representing different durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days cluster naturally into seven groups meanwhile for each duration the empirical points are roughly located on the same vertical plane while one would also expect an underlying curve relationship between observational lowflow quantity q and theoretical frequency f overall the long durations e g duration of 90 days have higher lowflow discharge than the short durations e g duration of 1 day besides the period of 1957 2018 has witnessed more lowflow discharge events that are of relatively lower frequencies e g frequency of less than 50 for all analyzed durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days the aforementioned results are also partially reflected by the duration dependent curves of calculated quantiles of lowflow discharge with respect to considered frequencies 2 25 50 75 and 98 varying from 1957 2018 see fig 7 for all analyzed durations almost all the empirical points of lowflow discharge during the period of 1957 2018 are situated between the frequencies of 2 and 98 according to the best fitted gev ao model furthermore most of the empirical points are distributed beside the quantile curves of intermediate frequencies 25 50 and 75 with lesser of them close to the extreme frequencies 2 and 98 for instance the historically minimum lowflow discharge covering all durations in 2003 reaching and even beyond the frequency of 2 should be paid more attention to additionally fig 8 illustrates the designed lowflow discharge of various durations distinguished by five representative frequencies from another perspective as can be seen with a given frequency e g 50 the gev ao model would suggest generally consistent fluctuations of the design value of lowflow discharge for all analyzed durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days for an extreme frequency of 2 the designed lowflow discharge of all seven durations roughly fluctuates between 80 and 120 m3 s but shows notably enhanced amplitudes since the 1990 s moreover similar results could be found for all other considered frequencies 25 50 75 and 98 3 4 2 the nonstationary qdf relationship using dual covariate gev ao ea model using the best fitted dual covariate model i e gev ao ea the three dimensional scatter diagram showing the nonstationary qdf relationships of lowflow in the sayr for all analyzed durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days is presented in fig 9 in general the results given by the gev ao ea model are just comparable to that of the single covariate gev ao model for a concerned duration e g 90d the implicit curve relationship between lowflow quantity q and frequency f could be obtained from the empirical points roughly situated on the same vertical plane incorporating another climate index i e ea against the single covariate gev ao model the dual covariate gev ao ea model can also provide the four dimensional relationships of quantity ao ea frequency q ao ea f as illustrated by the surface plots in fig 10 as is shown for five representative frequencies 2 25 50 75 and 98 the theoretical quantiles of lowflow discharge would slightly increase as the duration becomes longer from 1 day to 90 days although the patterns of graphic results for seven analyzed durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days are similar the sloping direction and angle could still reflect the different correlations between lowflow discharge and two adopted climate indices to be specific it suggests a stronger positive correlation between q and ao in comparison to a negative correlation between q and ea and this is in agreement with the analyses based on spearman s correlation coefficient similarly the duration dependent curves of calculated quantiles for five considered frequencies 2 25 50 75 and 98 as well as frequency dependent curves of design values for seven durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days based on the gev ao ea model are presented in figs 11 and 12 respectively although the results indicated here are equivalent to those given by the single covariate gev ao model figs 7 and 8 some noticeable differences are also found for instance the lowflow discharge in 2003 seems to be slightly moderated in terms of frequency not exceeding 2 for all analyzed durations besides the designed lowflow discharge of various durations tends to fluctuate more strongly for all considered frequencies 4 discussion it should be noted that the parameters are not always successfully obtained for nonstationary gev models presented in this study this mainly occurs in time related cases such as the single covariate gev time model with the most eight parameters of κ θ η μ 0 μ 1 μ 2 σ 0 and σ 1 and the dual covariate gev time ao and gev time ea models both have the most nine parameters of κ θ η μ 0 μ 1 μ 2 μ 3 μ 4 and σ 0 the causes are multifaceted and might be related to the optimization algorithm used for model parameter estimation theoretically there can be more complicated dual covariate e g the scale parameter σ t not as a constant and even multiple covariate nonstationary gev models while only the dual covariate models with relatively brief structures are discussed however at the same time with increased covariates and complexity of model structure the data requirements theoretical derivation parameter estimation etc would become extremely difficult the problems of dimension disaster and over fitting are also inevitable introducing overall greater challenges in model construction and application within the single and dual covariate gev models developed for the sayr the dependence of model parameters on time covariate is generally low e g the linear and quadratic coefficients of time covariate are small and close to zero occasionally in formulating the covariate dependent parameters μ t and σ t it implies that the nonstationarity of lowflow discharge is not primarily caused by the passage of time thus it is hard to effectively describe the noncoherent extreme value features of lowflow discharge with time as the unique covariate in a nonstationary model the performance of proposed nonstationary gev models taking time as a covariate needs further discussion on the one hand the goodness of fit of the gev time model that only uses time as a covariate seems to be apparently inferior to the stationary gev model gev stationary according to the log likelihood aic and bic it means that the simulation ability of nonstationary models whose parameters only vary with time is limited unexpectedly on the other hand the performance of the dual covariate gev models that adopt time and climate index as two covariates especially gev time ao tends to be almost comparable to the best fitted gev ao ea model making them also prospective tools for modeling and analyzing the lowflow discharge of other catchments for nonstationary analysis of hydro meteorological time series some studies only use a single covariate of time wu et al 2015 lu et al 2020 or climate factor wen et al 2019 while others consider both time and climate covariates to develop nonstationary statistical models e g ouarda et al 2019 these relevant studies compared stationary models with nonstationary models that incorporate different covariates and their results support that the nonstationary models with covariates show better performance than the stationary models and the climate informed covariates are superior to time covariate these points are generally consistent with the critical findings of the present study in addition to climate impacts human intervention as potential contributing factor to the nonstationarity of hydrological processes should also be properly considered for example there are currently studies that incorporate reservoir index as covariate for nonstationary analysis of flood lópez and francés 2013 and streamflow wang et al 2022 for nonstationary frequency analysis of lowflow there are also uncertainties caused by multiple factors such as sample size and parameter estimation method with a small sample size the maximum likelihood method tends to underestimate the shape parameters of statistical models which may lead to relatively larger root mean square error between observation and simulation lu et al 2017 moreover the constrained nonlinear optimization of model parameters using the interior point algorithm is essentially a gradient based method requiring that the objective and constraint functions are continuous and have continuous first derivatives when the requirements are not met or the problem is infeasible some substitute processing may be applicable such as attempting to minimize the maximum constraint value besides like many other optimization algorithms the limitations relevant to parameter estimation also include that it is hard to guarantee to get the global against local optimal solutions all of these aspects would increase the uncertainties in lowflow frequency analysis and should be recognized however the determination of potential direction underestimation or overestimation of how different factors and attendant uncertainties would affect the design values of lowflow is quite complicated and needs further intensive researches 5 conclusions using time and selected climate indices e g ao and ea as covariates this study has developed nonstationary gev models for analyzing multivariate probabilistic properties of lowflow the derivation of theoretical models parameter estimation and model evaluation procedures are provided as an application the nonstationary qdf relationships of lowflow in the sayr via proposed single and dual covariate gev models are derived and systematically analyzed overall the main findings and conclusions could be drawn as follows 1 according to the goodness of fit evaluation criteria the nonstationary gev model only using time as a covariate gev time is even inferior to the stationary gev model gev stationary in comparison the nonstationary gev models taking ci s as one or two covariates gev ao gev ea gev time ao gev time ea and gev ao ea generally show more strengths over the stationary gev model gev stationary 2 the gev ao and gev ao ea are respectively the best fitted single and dual covariate nonstationary gev models for all seven analyzed durations according to the aic criterion the gev ao is the optimal model for shorter durations 1d 3d and 7d whereas for long durations 15d 30d 60d and 90d the best model is gev ao ea in other words the single covariate model has superiority regarding 1 3 and 7 d durations while the goodness of fit of the dual covariate model is better with 15 30 60 and 90 durations however the bic criterion suggests that the gev ao is the optimal model for all considered durations therefore it turns out to be that the dual covariate model has not shown apparent advantages over the single covariate model 3 in addition to time a reasonable selection of other covariates for constructing nonstationary gev models is essential to improve the modeling of lowflow and to explore its multivariate probabilistic properties as an attempt introducing climate indices as critical covariates might be a good choice it is worthy of further mentioning the merits of the single and dual covariate nonstationary gev models developed in this study and the derived qdf relationships of lowflow from a historical perspective it is useful for reconstructing the lowflow discharge series of the past decades through stochastic simulation which might be essential to discover the intrinsic laws of lowflow e g occurrence development and change patterns and to analyze relevant multivariate probabilistic statistical relationships and characteristics effectively for the future on the other hand it is possible to predict the lowflow discharge with respect to different durations and concerned frequencies for the following several years using long term predictions of large scale climate indices e g ao and ea in the current study from either statistical or climatic global atmospheric circulation models which can help to guide the emergency management and regulation of water resources during the lowflow season likewise it can also be used to estimate the design value of lowflow discharge interval estimates with given conditions for the future assisting the design of engineering related to water resources development and utilization credit authorship

7626,study region the source area of the yellow river sayr located in the northeastern part of the qinghai tibet plateau china study focus this study attempts to produce the quantity duration

estimation is presented as the central part followed by model evaluation and recommendation time and two climate indices i e arctic oscillation ao and eastern asia ea are selected as covariates new hydrological insights for the region for the sayr nonstationary gev models incorporating additional climate informed covariates show apparent strengths over stationary gev model using ao and ea as

regulation of water resources during the lowflow season and to assistant the design of water engineering for the future period graphical abstract ga1 keywords lowflow nonstationary gev model climatic covariate qdf relationship yellow river data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the combined influence of climate change and intensive human activities have significantly altered the global water cycling processes in recent decades gudmundsson et al 2021 cooley et al 2021 as the observed time series increasingly show nonstationary characteristics the stationarity assumption of hydrological frequency analysis under changing environments is facing greater challenges tan et al 2020 milly et al 2015 argued that the assumption of stationarity in a changing environment is no longer applicable to risk assessment of water resources based on which the current approaches would produce deviated results failing to reflect the actual situations for instance the nonstationarity of runoff and streamflow originating from extreme rainfall processes should be reasonably addressed with advances in climate change research the studies on nonstationarity of hydrological processes from the perspective of climatic factors have gained growing attention such as focusing on the nonstationary characteristic of extreme rainfall flood and drought events in particular the generalized extreme value gev distribution that unifies the weibull gumbel and frechet distributions kotz and nadarajah 2000 has been widely used for frequency analysis of hydrological extremes in the context of univariate analysis the gev distribution shows good performance in extreme rainfall probability distribution selection ballarin et al 2022 for both historical observations and future projections at various temporal scales from sub hourly to annual qin and dai 2022 das et al 2022 musara et al 2022 meanwhile the gev distribution is also applied for site and regional flood frequency analysis kebebew and awass 2022 lescesen et al 2022 forecasting steirou et al 2022 modeling and projection ossandon et al 2022 etc on the other hand the intensity duration frequency idf curves based on the gev distribution are considered useful tools for multivariate frequency analysis of extreme rainfall events roksvag et al 2021 kourtis et al 2022 which may help to improve the understanding of the influence of climate change on heavy rainfalls and reduce the consequential multidimensional risks zhao et al 2022 likewise the severity duration frequency sdf curves have been developed for meteorological sahana et al 2020 kumar et al 2021 hydrological streamflow sung and chung 2014 razmkhah 2017 agricultural samantaray et al 2019 and ecological halwatura et al 2015 droughts using the threshold level and copula based methods nevertheless the above literature is generally in the background of consistent circumstances e g use of the stationary gev model regardless of the pronounced nonstationarity of hydro meteorological processes to cope with the overwhelming increase and variation in extreme rainfall events the updated time varying idf curves are developed for the design and management of water resource infrastructure vinnarasi and dhanya 2021 gao et al 2022 for example hajani 2022 investigated the possible impacts of climate change and multi decadal climate variability on rainfall extremes and obtained the new idf curves coupling both stationary and nonstationary gev distributions moreover the gev distribution is also tested for flood frequency analysis with nonstationary data series in regulated catchments gruss et al 2022 these attempts suggest that the nonstationary gev model has desirable potentiality in dealing with hydrological extreme events e g rainfall and can be helpful for frequency analysis of hydrological processes losing stationarity under changing environments rainfall and flood extremes have been extensively investigated and discussed whereas dry season water cycling has not yet drawn enough attention in fact the dry season as a period of more problems in water resources water ecology and water environment is susceptible to the impact of natural and social systems on the water discharge processes although the negative anomalies in streamflow sequences have been a concern by streamflow drought analyses the focus is essentially on the abnormal phenomenon of less streamflow even in wet seasons rather than on the extremely low river flow i e lowflow of different durations in the dry season furthermore the sdf curves of drought events are basically based on the stationary model which needs to define drought characteristics severity and duration with a calculated drought index before obtaining the multivariate probabilistic relationship of sdf sung and chung 2014 kumar et al 2021 at present most nonstationary models e g gev developed for hydrological extremes only use time as a covariate to construct statistical distribution models with time varying parameters the problem is that these models lack the necessary physical bases and cannot effectively reflect the nonstationary impacts of the external environment such as climate factors on model parameters ouarda et al 2019 vinnarasi and dhanya 2021 some climate informed covariates were introduced in previously developed time varying idf curves of extreme rainfall e g ouarda et al 2019 however more efforts and improvements are still needed with respect to the selection of covariates derivation of theoretical models and parameter estimation evaluation and application of different models etc analogous to the idf curves used for rainfall the current study attempts to produce a lowflow quantity duration frequency qdf relationship through a nonstationary approach of the gev models using time and macroscale climate indices as covariates the study domain is the source area of the yellow river sayr where the anthropogenic influences are not far reaching and the reduction of lowflow is mainly caused by climatic warming xu et al 2022 ma et al 2021 up to now few studies have been reported on the application of nonstationary gev models to lowflow and none on the incorporation of climate factors for relevant analyses in the sayr the objectives of this study are to develop nonstationary gev models with climate informed covariates in addition to time using annual least lowflow discharge of different durations and monthly time series of climate indices and to establish the qdf relationships of lowflow in the sayr through assessment of proposed nonstationary gev models with different combinations of time and or climatic covariates the layout of the remainder of this article is as follows section 2 describes informative details about the materials and methods and section 3 presents the results mainly shown in terms of illustrations afterwards relevant discussion is provided in section 4 before the conclusions are finally summarized in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the source area of the yellow river sayr is located in the northeastern part of the qinghai tibet plateau covering the yellow river basin yrb above longyangxia reservoir and the catchment area drained at tangnaihai gauge 100 09 e 35 30 n is 122 000 km2 about 16 of the yrb the location of the sayr and tangnaihai gauge is shown in fig 1 the sayr belongs to a continental plateau climate category with an annual average precipitation of about 488 mm while the annual average runoff is about 20 billion m3 accounting for 35 of the whole yrb the topography of the sayr is dominated by mountains hills and basins mainly covered by grasslands water bodies and permanent wetlands where the ecological environment is relatively fragile and slight changes in climate may cause considerable responses ma et al 2023 meanwhile because of its location on the westernmost edge of the east asian monsoon region the stress and position of the subtropical anticyclone over the western pacific would lead to large uncertainties in the regional moisture supply from the southeastern warm and humid atmospheric circulation thus the precipitation of the sayr shows apparent oscillations at both interannual and seasonal time scales besides the sayr has been affected by natural erosions and human activities over a long time which intensifies its ecological problems such as soil erosion and grassland degradation the water resource and eco environmental protection of the sayr play a key role in the sustainability of the entire yrb the flood season of the yrb starts no earlier than april and ends no later than october moreover the proportion of river flow of the sayr in december january and february is also very low therefore the period from november to april is considered to define the lowflow season of the sayr in this study specifically using the observed daily streamflow of the tangnaihai gauge from 1957 to 2018 the datasets of annual least volumetric quantity q of lowflow discharge corresponding to seven representative durations d i e 1 day 3 day 7 day 15 day 30 day 60 day and 90 day are constructed as the input to the development of multivariate probabilistic models integrating nonstationary quantity duration frequency qdf relationships of lowflow in the sayr considering the impact of climate oscillations on river flow nonstationarity of different durations in this study up to 26 macroscale climate indices see table s1 for more details are considered to examine the teleconnections between climate oscillation and lowflow discharge of the sayr these data are monthly atmospheric and oceanic time series of climate indices from the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa http www esrl noaa gov psd data climateindices list 2 2 detection of nonstationarity in this study the smooth processing i e moving average and the mann kendall m k test are conducted for trend and mutation analyses with respect to the nonstationarity in preprocessed lowflow discharge time series of the sayr from 1957 to 2018 2 2 1 the smooth processing the moving average is mostly used in trend analysis which can reduce the randomness of the tested sequence while highlighting its changing trend to this end a five year moving average transform is performed for trend analysis as follows 1 y t 1 2 k 1 i 0 2 k x t i where y t is the smoothed sequence after moving average and x t is the original sequence i 0 1 2 k represents moving steps within a certain time window and k 2 determines a specific time window of five years 2 2 2 the mann kendall test as a nonparametric tool the mann kendall test which is basically not affected by outliers is preferable for mutation analysis specifically for an original sequence x with a sample size of n construct a new ordered sequence of s k and calculate the following statistics mann 1945 kendall 1975 2 s k i 1 k r i k 2 3 n 3 u f k s k e s k var s k where r i 1 x i x j 0 x i x j 1 j i e s k and var s k are the mean and variance of s k respectively and uf 1 0 arrange the sequence x in a reversed order and let ub k uf k k n n 1 1 given a significance level of α 0 05 uf k 1 96 indicates a significant trend of change in the original sequence x and the intersection of ub k and uf k within the confidence interval means a mutation point accordingly 2 3 selection of climate indices the measurement for correlation analysis i e spearman s nonlinear rank correlation coefficient ρ is calculated to assure the teleconnections between lowflow discharge and climate indices thus the large scale climate indices having the highest correlation with lowflow discharge are selected as climatic covariates for deriving time varying parameters to construct the nonstationary gev models for pairwise elements usually in terms of two column vectors of x n and y n where n is the length of each column the correlation coefficient can be obtained as hollander and wolfe 1973 4 ρ n 12 n n 1 n 1 i 1 n r i s i 3 n 1 n 1 where r i and s i are the ranks of the two columns i e the order of sample data x i and y i in x 1 x n and y 1 y n respectively considering the possible connection between lowflow discharge and climate indices with different time lags lowflow discharge relative to climate indices this study analyzes the correlation between lowflow quantity q and averaged climate indices of consecutive 1 6 months sliding step 1 2 3 4 5 6 months for preceding 0 5 years time lag 0 1 2 3 4 5 years while 0 year time lag indicating the concurrent year the time series of climate indices having the highest correlation with lowflow discharge are adopted as selected covariates in the construction of nonstationary gev models allowing the formulation of time varying parameters 2 4 derivation of the nonstationary gev model 2 4 1 the stationary gev model the stationary gev model is based on the generalized extreme value distribution according to the theory of extreme value the gev distribution can be expressed as the following three parameter distribution function kotz and nadarajah 2000 5 f x p x x exp 1 κ x μ σ 1 κ where x denotes a random variable following the gev distribution μ and σ are the location and scale parameters respectively κ is the shape parameter generally assumed to be constant for a given frequency p by solving p f x p the corresponding quantile design value x p can be derived as 6 x p μ σ κ 1 ln p κ for each given duration d i i 1 2 m the annual series of corresponding lowest quantity of river discharge q j d j 1 2 n can be constructed in order to define the lowflow quantity duration frequency qdf relationships where m stands for the groups of selected durations and n is the length of studied years in the stationary gev model assuming that the lowflow quantity q of each duration has a gev distribution function as eq 5 the corresponding frequency p and return period t can be related as 7 t 1 1 p x x p 1 p x x p through mathematical derivation the defined qdf relationship of lowflow using the stationary gev model can be finally obtained as ouarda et al 2019 8 q t d a t b d μ σ κ 1 ln 1 t κ d θ η where b d d θ η θ and η are shape parameters of the stationary gev model usually assumed to be constants thus b d can be regarded as a constant as a whole if the probability distribution function of q d is f q d q d then x q d b d also follows the same gev distribution i e f q d q d f x x t 1 t then a t can be represented as 9 a t f x 1 1 t μ σ κ 1 ln 1 t κ 2 4 2 the nonstationary gev model the nonstationarity of the gev model lies largely in that the parameters μ and σ are no longer constants but variables depending on covariates under nonstationary conditions the gev distribution function can be rewritten as 10 f x exp 1 κ x μ t σ t 1 κ where μ t and σ t are the location and scale parameters dependent on covariates respectively κ is the shape parameter still assumed to be a constant since the parameters μ and σ in the stationary gev model become covariate dependent parameters μ t and σ t the qdf relationship of lowflow based on the nonstationary gev model accordingly turns out to be 11 q t d μ t σ t κ 1 ln 1 t κ d θ η it should be noted that the dependence of μ t and σ t on covariates may have different forms so as to obtain the best fitted model when considering nonstationary properties the dependence of model parameters on covariates is generally subject to linear y a bx or quadratic y a bx c x 2 meanwhile regarding the number of covariates only one covariate and two covariate models are considered in this study that is either time or climate index ci is used as a single covariate whereas the combination of time ci or ci ci is set as dual covariates 2 4 2 1 single covariate model using only time or ci as a covariate the single covariate nonstationary gev models include time covariate gev time and ci covariate gev ci considering the forms of parameter dependence linear and quadratic and using y t to represent the covariate the parameters μ t and σ t of nonstationary gev distribution can be expressed as 12 μ t μ 0 μ 0 μ 1 y t μ 0 μ 1 y t μ 2 y t 2 13 σ t σ 0 σ 0 σ 1 y t when the location parameter μ t μ 0 and scale parameter σ t σ 0 it becomes the stationary gev model the dependence of location parameter μ t on the covariate y t can be linear or quadratic and only linear dependence of scale parameter σ t on the covariate y t is considered thus the single covariate nonstationary gev model has five specific expressions according to different forms of parameter dependence the structure and parameter composition of each model are systematically presented in table 1 2 4 2 2 dual covariate model using time and ci as two covariates the dual covariate nonstationary gev models include time ci covariates gev time ci and ci ci covariates gev ci ci considering the forms of parameter dependence linear and quadratic and using y t and z t to represent the two covariates the parameters μ t and σ t of nonstationary gev distribution are given as 14 μ t μ 0 μ 1 y t μ 2 z t μ 0 μ 1 y t μ 2 y t 2 μ 3 z t μ 0 μ 1 y t μ 2 z t μ 3 z t 2 μ 0 μ 1 y t μ 2 y t 2 μ 3 z t μ 4 z t 2 15 σ t σ 0 with two covariates and quadratic dependence the specific forms of the location parameter μ t may become quite complicated in this study only the case of constant scale parameter σ t σ 0 is considered for brevity accordingly the dual covariate nonstationary gev model has four specific expressions with the derived structure and parameter composition of each model explicitly shown in table 2 2 5 estimation of model parameters 2 5 1 the maximum likelihood approach the maximum likelihood method is further developed to estimate the parameters in proposed nonstationary gev models of different complexity e g single covariate or dual covariate linear or quadratic dependence on covariate for the sayr in consideration of nonstationarity the location and scale parameters of gev distribution become covariate dependent variables i e μ t and σ t instead of μ and σ according to section 2 4 1 the lowflow quantity of different durations q d and x q d b d share the following gev distribution function f x x modified from eq 10 under nonstationary conditions 16 f x x exp 1 κ x d θ η μ t σ t 1 κ where x is an independent variable denoting the lowflow quantity q and d is a constant for a given duration d for single covariate nonstationary gev model the probability distribution function f q q of lowflow quantity q has five specific forms see the last column of table 1 similarly for dual covariate nonstationary gev model the probability distribution function f q q has four specific forms see the last column of table 2 then the probability density function of lowflow quantity q can be obtained by taking the first order derivation of eq 16 as follows 17 f q d θ η σ t 1 κ q d θ η μ t σ t 1 κ 1 exp 1 κ q d θ η μ t σ t 1 κ let f q 1 q 2 q m ψ t be the joint probability density function of lowflow quantity of different durations q d 1 q d 2 q d m and the likelihood function can be further obtained as 18 l ψ t q 1 q 2 q m j 1 n f q j 1 q j 2 q jm ψ t where q is the sample value of lowflow quantity q q jm represents the lowflow quantity of the j th year for the m th duarion ψ t stands for the set of parameters to be estimated assuming the lowflow quantity of different durations q d i i 1 2 m are independent with each other and have the same class of probability distribution i e gev distribution then the likelihood function can be simplified as 19 l ψ t q j 1 n i 1 m f q ji ψ t to facilitate the optimization of parameters a sum function is finally constructed by taking the logarithm of both sides of eq 19 20 l f ψ t q ln j 1 n i 1 m f q ji ψ t j 1 n i 1 m ln f q ji ψ t in this study the interior point algorithm with nonlinear and bound constraints is used for model parameter optimization byrd et al 1999 the first derivative of the proposed objective function iterates from a given initial point and gradually converges to the possible optimal solution the interior point approach to constrained minimization aims to obtain the parameters when the objective function achieves the minimum value in the nonlinear programming let the objective function be fun l f ψ t q where the set of parameters ψ t can be estimated by solving a sequence of approximate minimization problems 2 5 2 single covariate model for single covariate nonstationary gev model the dependence of location and scale parameters μ t and σ t on the covariate time or ci may have various forms and the covariate y t can be time of year or a certain ci the procedure of estimating model parameters using above maximum likelihood method is as follows first according to the specific model structure and probability distribution function f q q ψ t of lowflow quantity q see table 1 take the first order derivative of q and obtain corresponding probability density function f q ψ t as given by eq 17 then construct the log likelihood function l f ψ t q on the basis of eqs 18 to 20 finally give the initial values of parameter estimates and optimize model parameters through the optimization tool i e to find the parameter composition ψ ˆ t see the third column of table 1 that maximizes the log likelihood function l f ψ t q 2 5 3 dual covariate model for dual covariate nonstationary gev model the forms of location and scale parameters μ t and σ t dependent on covariates time and ci are also diverse given the scale parameter σ t as a constant σ t σ 0 the covariate y t represents time of year or a certain ci and the other covariate z t denotes another ci similarly the following procedure for model parameter estimation based on the maximum likelihood method is applicable first with a specific model structure and probability distribution function f q q ψ t of lowflow quantity q see table 2 take the first order derivative of q and obtain the corresponding probability density function f q ψ t then establish the log likelihood function l f ψ t q finally estimate and optimize model parameters through iteration from given initial values finding the parameter composition ψ ˆ t see the third column of table 2 that maximizes the log likelihood function l f ψ t q 2 6 criteria of goodness of fit to balance the number of parameters and the maximized log likelihood of proposed nonstationary gev models the akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic are adopted for assessing the goodness of fit box et al 1994 21 aic 2 l f ψ ˆ t q 2 k 22 bic 2 l f ψ ˆ t q ln n k where k is the number of model parameters n is the sample size 2 k and ln n k are the penalty terms the minimum values of aic and or bic indicate the best fitness between empirical points and the theoretical model 3 results 3 1 the nonstationarity of lowflow discharge unsurprisingly the observed lowflow discharge of the sayr for all analyzed durations of 1 90 days during 1957 2018 shows apparent nonstationarity illustrated in fig 2 as can be seen the trend in annual least lowflow discharge of different durations e g 7d is further manifested by the smoothed evolution of the five year moving average and relevant linear trendlines although the fluctuation of lowflow discharge bottoming in the early 2000s seems to be out of order the five year moving average makes its upward and downward tendencies clearer meanwhile the multi stage trend in lowflow discharge is identified through linear regression specifically the 1 day 3 day 7 day 15 day 30 day 60 day and 90 day lowest streamflow generally increased from the 1950s to the mid 1980s and decreased afterward until another drastic rise occurred at around the mid 2000s and maintained ever since the multi stage trend and mutation points of lowflow discharge using the mann kendall test are also demonstrated in fig 2 on the one hand the calculated statistic uf confirms the three stage trend in lowflow discharge of different durations during the period of 1957 2018 in particular the rising trend from the 1950s to the mid 1980s is statistically significant α 0 05 while the values of the statistic uf are beyond the threshold value of 1 96 furthermore the two mutation points at around the mid 1980s and late 2000s indicated by the intersection of statistics uf and ub are both statistically significant within the confidence interval therefore the above analyses support the nonstationarity in lowflow discharge and suggest the necessity of developing nonstationary models to analyze its probabilistic properties 3 2 the selected climate indices as covariates the individual correlation between monthly atmospheric and oceanic time series of 26 climate indices listed in table s1 with lowflow discharge of different durations is checked in fact the spearman s correlation coefficients between lowflow discharge of different durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days and averaged climate indices sliding step 1 2 3 4 5 6 months of preceding five years time lag 0 1 2 3 4 5 years are computed for comparative purposes from the results two preferable climate indices i e arctic oscillation ao and eastern asia ea yielding relatively higher correlation coefficients are filtered out and systematically illustrated in figs 3 and 4 as can be seen from fig 3 for lowflow discharge and averaged ao of the same year time lag 0 year spearman s correlation coefficients can be positive or negative but all close to zero suggesting negligible correlations however for time lags of 1 and 2 years the correlation coefficients are predominantly positive with negative values close to zero in particular the 1 month ao with a 2 year time lag yields the highest positive correlation coefficients for the lowflow discharge of all durations moreover for time lags of longer than three years most of the correlation coefficients are negative and relatively noticeable in a few cases e g 5 month sliding step and 3 year time lag by contrast the correlation coefficients between lowflow discharge and averaged ea fig 4 are mainly negative except for the cases with a time lag of 4 years especially the ea of 1 month sliding step with a 0 year time lag has the highest negative correlation coefficients regarding the lowflow discharge of all durations according to above results the time series of 1 month ao 2 year time lag and ea 0 year time lag are finally adopted as covariates apart from the time of year i e 1957 1958 2018 to construct nonstationary gev models aiming to investigate the lowflow discharge of various durations 3 3 development of the nonstationary gev model 3 3 1 model construction and parameter estimation following the derivation of theoretical models and parameter estimation presented in sections 2 4 and 2 5 respectively the nonstationary gev models of different structures using time and or climate indices ao and ea as a single or dual covariate are analytically constructed for whom the set of parameters is also obtained through optimization algorithm as a contrast the stationary gev model is also considered at the same time for the lowflow discharge of each duration d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 the stationary and nonstationary gev models are individually built and the finalized parameters of all models are provided in tables s2 to s8 as can be seen apart from the constant parameters κ θ and η the time varying parameters μ t and σ t dependent on covariate indicated by y t or z t combinations of time ci time ci and ci ci are also derived by giving the linear and quadratic dependence coefficients of μ 0 μ 1 μ 2 μ 3 μ 4 and σ 0 σ 1 using the estimates of all these parameters the complete analytic expressions of the nonstationary gev models as the form of eq 11 that bridges the qdf relationship of lowflow could be readily formulated in other words the five and four specific qdf relationships of lowflow using single and dual covariate nonstationary gev models given by the first columns of tables 1 and 2 respectively all become addressable 3 3 2 model evaluation in addition to the log likelihood the aic and bic criteria incorporating penalties regarding the number of model parameters and sample size can help to identify the best fitted one out of more than 20 stationary and nonstationary gev models for the lowflow discharge of each duration d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days the log likelihood the number of parameters and goodness of fit criteria i e aic and bic of the stationary and all nonstationary single and dual covariate gev models are demonstrated in tables s2 s8 as is shown for all considered durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days the best fitted single covariate model is with no exception the gev ao model having the least six parameters of κ θ η μ 0 μ 1 and σ 0 amongst the many models of different structures covariates gev time gev ao and gev ea and parameter compositions 6 8 parameters as indicated in table 1 similarly the best fitted dual covariate model for all analyzed durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days is the gev ao ea model with the least seven parameters of κ θ η μ 0 μ 1 μ 2 and σ 0 out of the many models of different structures covariates gev time ao gev time ea and gev ao ea and parameter compositions 7 9 parameters as presented in table 2 on that basis the stationary and best fitted single and dual covariate gev models for each duration d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days are further compared in table 3 it is found that the single covariate gev ao model is the optimal gev model for short durations d 1 3 7 days according to both aic and bic in contrast for longer durations d 15 30 60 90 days the optimal gev model turns out to be the dual covariate gev ao ea model based on the aic values however in terms of bic that additionally considers the sample size the gev ao model would be optimal for all analyzed durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days at the same time the nonstationary gev ao and gev ao ea models seem to outdistance the stationary gev model gev stationary with overwhelming preference yielding larger log likelihood but smaller aic and bic values for thorough and more systematic comparisons the gev stationary gev ao and gev ao ea models with respect to lowflow discharge of seven durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days are performed using the estimated model parameters provided in table 3 3 3 3 model performance and recommendation the performance of the gev stationary gev ao and gev ao ea models for each duration d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days is illustrated and compared in fig 5 as can be seen the annual least volumetric quantity q of lowflow discharge during 1957 2018 for all seven analyzed durations basically falls between the frequencies of 2 and 98 derived from the gev stationary gev ao and gev ao ea models the difference lies in that the gev stationary model can only provide constant quantiles whereas the gev ao and gev ao ea models are able to generate quantiles varying in different years as a result the gev stationary model produces three straight lines representing frequencies of 2 50 and 98 that fail to match well with the empirical points of annual least lowflow discharge in comparison the fluctuated variations of computed quantiles corresponding to theoretical frequencies based on the gev ao and gev ao ea models tend to be generally more in agreement with the empirical points as an example table 4 compares the designed annual least lowflow discharge with 50 frequency 2 year return period using different gev models it is seen that the gev stationary model outputs specific design values whereas the gev ao and gev ao ea models are capable of providing interval estimates of designed lowflow discharge moreover the design values given by the gev stationary model are all included in the intervals derived from the gev ao and gev ao ea models one would also notice the considerable gap between the lower limit of interval and the constant design value while the former might help to make more cautious strategies of water resources management when facing more severe situations therefore the single covariate gev ao and dual covariate gev ao ea models are recommended to investigate multivariate probabilistic properties of lowflow through proposed nonstationary qdf relationships 3 4 the nonstationary multivariate probabilistic properties of lowflow 3 4 1 the nonstationary qdf relationship using single covariate gev ao model using the best fitted single covariate model i e gev ao the nonstationary quantity duration frequency qdf relationships of lowflow in the sayr for all analyzed durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days are first visualized through the three dimensional scatter diagram of fig 6 it is clearly seen that the empirical points representing different durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days cluster naturally into seven groups meanwhile for each duration the empirical points are roughly located on the same vertical plane while one would also expect an underlying curve relationship between observational lowflow quantity q and theoretical frequency f overall the long durations e g duration of 90 days have higher lowflow discharge than the short durations e g duration of 1 day besides the period of 1957 2018 has witnessed more lowflow discharge events that are of relatively lower frequencies e g frequency of less than 50 for all analyzed durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days the aforementioned results are also partially reflected by the duration dependent curves of calculated quantiles of lowflow discharge with respect to considered frequencies 2 25 50 75 and 98 varying from 1957 2018 see fig 7 for all analyzed durations almost all the empirical points of lowflow discharge during the period of 1957 2018 are situated between the frequencies of 2 and 98 according to the best fitted gev ao model furthermore most of the empirical points are distributed beside the quantile curves of intermediate frequencies 25 50 and 75 with lesser of them close to the extreme frequencies 2 and 98 for instance the historically minimum lowflow discharge covering all durations in 2003 reaching and even beyond the frequency of 2 should be paid more attention to additionally fig 8 illustrates the designed lowflow discharge of various durations distinguished by five representative frequencies from another perspective as can be seen with a given frequency e g 50 the gev ao model would suggest generally consistent fluctuations of the design value of lowflow discharge for all analyzed durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days for an extreme frequency of 2 the designed lowflow discharge of all seven durations roughly fluctuates between 80 and 120 m3 s but shows notably enhanced amplitudes since the 1990 s moreover similar results could be found for all other considered frequencies 25 50 75 and 98 3 4 2 the nonstationary qdf relationship using dual covariate gev ao ea model using the best fitted dual covariate model i e gev ao ea the three dimensional scatter diagram showing the nonstationary qdf relationships of lowflow in the sayr for all analyzed durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days is presented in fig 9 in general the results given by the gev ao ea model are just comparable to that of the single covariate gev ao model for a concerned duration e g 90d the implicit curve relationship between lowflow quantity q and frequency f could be obtained from the empirical points roughly situated on the same vertical plane incorporating another climate index i e ea against the single covariate gev ao model the dual covariate gev ao ea model can also provide the four dimensional relationships of quantity ao ea frequency q ao ea f as illustrated by the surface plots in fig 10 as is shown for five representative frequencies 2 25 50 75 and 98 the theoretical quantiles of lowflow discharge would slightly increase as the duration becomes longer from 1 day to 90 days although the patterns of graphic results for seven analyzed durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days are similar the sloping direction and angle could still reflect the different correlations between lowflow discharge and two adopted climate indices to be specific it suggests a stronger positive correlation between q and ao in comparison to a negative correlation between q and ea and this is in agreement with the analyses based on spearman s correlation coefficient similarly the duration dependent curves of calculated quantiles for five considered frequencies 2 25 50 75 and 98 as well as frequency dependent curves of design values for seven durations d 1 3 7 15 30 60 90 days based on the gev ao ea model are presented in figs 11 and 12 respectively although the results indicated here are equivalent to those given by the single covariate gev ao model figs 7 and 8 some noticeable differences are also found for instance the lowflow discharge in 2003 seems to be slightly moderated in terms of frequency not exceeding 2 for all analyzed durations besides the designed lowflow discharge of various durations tends to fluctuate more strongly for all considered frequencies 4 discussion it should be noted that the parameters are not always successfully obtained for nonstationary gev models presented in this study this mainly occurs in time related cases such as the single covariate gev time model with the most eight parameters of κ θ η μ 0 μ 1 μ 2 σ 0 and σ 1 and the dual covariate gev time ao and gev time ea models both have the most nine parameters of κ θ η μ 0 μ 1 μ 2 μ 3 μ 4 and σ 0 the causes are multifaceted and might be related to the optimization algorithm used for model parameter estimation theoretically there can be more complicated dual covariate e g the scale parameter σ t not as a constant and even multiple covariate nonstationary gev models while only the dual covariate models with relatively brief structures are discussed however at the same time with increased covariates and complexity of model structure the data requirements theoretical derivation parameter estimation etc would become extremely difficult the problems of dimension disaster and over fitting are also inevitable introducing overall greater challenges in model construction and application within the single and dual covariate gev models developed for the sayr the dependence of model parameters on time covariate is generally low e g the linear and quadratic coefficients of time covariate are small and close to zero occasionally in formulating the covariate dependent parameters μ t and σ t it implies that the nonstationarity of lowflow discharge is not primarily caused by the passage of time thus it is hard to effectively describe the noncoherent extreme value features of lowflow discharge with time as the unique covariate in a nonstationary model the performance of proposed nonstationary gev models taking time as a covariate needs further discussion on the one hand the goodness of fit of the gev time model that only uses time as a covariate seems to be apparently inferior to the stationary gev model gev stationary according to the log likelihood aic and bic it means that the simulation ability of nonstationary models whose parameters only vary with time is limited unexpectedly on the other hand the performance of the dual covariate gev models that adopt time and climate index as two covariates especially gev time ao tends to be almost comparable to the best fitted gev ao ea model making them also prospective tools for modeling and analyzing the lowflow discharge of other catchments for nonstationary analysis of hydro meteorological time series some studies only use a single covariate of time wu et al 2015 lu et al 2020 or climate factor wen et al 2019 while others consider both time and climate covariates to develop nonstationary statistical models e g ouarda et al 2019 these relevant studies compared stationary models with nonstationary models that incorporate different covariates and their results support that the nonstationary models with covariates show better performance than the stationary models and the climate informed covariates are superior to time covariate these points are generally consistent with the critical findings of the present study in addition to climate impacts human intervention as potential contributing factor to the nonstationarity of hydrological processes should also be properly considered for example there are currently studies that incorporate reservoir index as covariate for nonstationary analysis of flood lópez and francés 2013 and streamflow wang et al 2022 for nonstationary frequency analysis of lowflow there are also uncertainties caused by multiple factors such as sample size and parameter estimation method with a small sample size the maximum likelihood method tends to underestimate the shape parameters of statistical models which may lead to relatively larger root mean square error between observation and simulation lu et al 2017 moreover the constrained nonlinear optimization of model parameters using the interior point algorithm is essentially a gradient based method requiring that the objective and constraint functions are continuous and have continuous first derivatives when the requirements are not met or the problem is infeasible some substitute processing may be applicable such as attempting to minimize the maximum constraint value besides like many other optimization algorithms the limitations relevant to parameter estimation also include that it is hard to guarantee to get the global against local optimal solutions all of these aspects would increase the uncertainties in lowflow frequency analysis and should be recognized however the determination of potential direction underestimation or overestimation of how different factors and attendant uncertainties would affect the design values of lowflow is quite complicated and needs further intensive researches 5 conclusions using time and selected climate indices e g ao and ea as covariates this study has developed nonstationary gev models for analyzing multivariate probabilistic properties of lowflow the derivation of theoretical models parameter estimation and model evaluation procedures are provided as an application the nonstationary qdf relationships of lowflow in the sayr via proposed single and dual covariate gev models are derived and systematically analyzed overall the main findings and conclusions could be drawn as follows 1 according to the goodness of fit evaluation criteria the nonstationary gev model only using time as a covariate gev time is even inferior to the stationary gev model gev stationary in comparison the nonstationary gev models taking ci s as one or two covariates gev ao gev ea gev time ao gev time ea and gev ao ea generally show more strengths over the stationary gev model gev stationary 2 the gev ao and gev ao ea are respectively the best fitted single and dual covariate nonstationary gev models for all seven analyzed durations according to the aic criterion the gev ao is the optimal model for shorter durations 1d 3d and 7d whereas for long durations 15d 30d 60d and 90d the best model is gev ao ea in other words the single covariate model has superiority regarding 1 3 and 7 d durations while the goodness of fit of the dual covariate model is better with 15 30 60 and 90 durations however the bic criterion suggests that the gev ao is the optimal model for all considered durations therefore it turns out to be that the dual covariate model has not shown apparent advantages over the single covariate model 3 in addition to time a reasonable selection of other covariates for constructing nonstationary gev models is essential to improve the modeling of lowflow and to explore its multivariate probabilistic properties as an attempt introducing climate indices as critical covariates might be a good choice it is worthy of further mentioning the merits of the single and dual covariate nonstationary gev models developed in this study and the derived qdf relationships of lowflow from a historical perspective it is useful for reconstructing the lowflow discharge series of the past decades through stochastic simulation which might be essential to discover the intrinsic laws of lowflow e g occurrence development and change patterns and to analyze relevant multivariate probabilistic statistical relationships and characteristics effectively for the future on the other hand it is possible to predict the lowflow discharge with respect to different durations and concerned frequencies for the following several years using long term predictions of large scale climate indices e g ao and ea in the current study from either statistical or climatic global atmospheric circulation models which can help to guide the emergency management and regulation of water resources during the lowflow season likewise it can also be used to estimate the design value of lowflow discharge interval estimates with given conditions for the future assisting the design of engineering related to water resources development and utilization credit authorship

7627,study region the tibetan plateau study focus evapotranspiration et plays a critical role in the water balance energy budget and carbon cycle however the variations trends and controls of et on the tibetan plateau tp are poorly understood because of uncertainties in et estimates and sparse observations in this study the variations in et and its components and their drivers and controls in the tp were analyzed at seasonal and annual scales during 1982 2015 new hydrological insights for the region spatially the multiyear mean annual et decreased from the southeastern to northwestern tp canopy transpiration ec was the main component of et 52 7 followed by soil evaporation es 34 4 and interception ei 10 7 regionally the averaged et and its components increased significantly at the seasonal and annual scales spatially the controlling factor for et changed from water to energy as the climatic zones transferred from aridity to humidity the annual et was controlled by soil moisture sm in arid and semi arid zones whereas ta was the dominant factor in the other regions the increased annual es and ei were primarily caused by sm while the annual ec was determined by ta in addition ndvi played a certain role in regulating the annual ec and ei variations this study improves our understanding of hydrological processes and water resource management under global climate change graphical abstract ga1 keywords evapotranspiration contribution analysis climate change vegetation greening tibetan plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et which consists of soil evaporation es canopy transpiration ec and canopy interception ei not only plays a critical role in the water balance but is also a key element in energy and carbon cycles jung et al 2010 chang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 the global et has shown a significant increasing trend in recent years zeng et al 2012 bai and liu 2018 xu et al 2019 an increase in et and a shift in precipitation distribution have accelerated the hydrological cycles under global and regional climate change huntington 2006 habeeb et al 2019 as one of the most challenging aspects of water and energy balance analyses the accurate assessment of the spatiotemporal dynamics of et and its drivers is essential to fully understand the eco hydrological processes and predict potential changes in the hydrological cycle song et al 2017 especially in the context of changing environments many studies have evaluated the spatiotemporal variations in et based on remote sensing in situ observations reanalysis data and land surface models mueller et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 sun et al 2020 however owing to the substantial uncertainties in et estimations there is no consistent conclusion on the drivers and controls of et at regional and global scales mueller et al 2013 li et al 2018 wartenburger et al 2018 especially in complex terrain regions such as the tibetan plateau tp in addition different et components can show contrasting responses to environmental drivers due to the differences in physical and physiological processes underlying these components tsuruta et al 2016 moreover the controlling factors of et varied significantly at different temporal and spatial scales i e scott and biederman 2019 han et al 2021a thus the driving mechanism needs to be comprehensively investigated in detail therefore it is essential to fully understand the driving mechanisms of et and its partitioning which contributes to interpreting the hydrological dynamics assessing the ecosystem evolution and providing suggestions for water management the tp known as the third pole and the world of roof is the headwater region of many major rivers in asia and is exceptionally sensitive to climate change immerzeel et al 2010 it has experienced significant warming and greening over the past few decades yao et al 2019 wang et al 2021 although previous studies have evaluated the spatiotemporal variations and controls of et in the tp using various models song et al 2017 wang et al 2018 sun et al 2020 ma and zhang 2022 there is no consensus on the drivers and controls of et for example some studies have suggested that et is controlled predominantly by soil moisture or precipitation yin et al 2013 song et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 ma and zhang 2022 while other studies have demonstrated that et is also controlled by other environmental variables wang et al 2018 sun et al 2020 even the factors influencing the temporal trends in et may be different from those controlling the spatial distributions of et which needs further investigation apart from the controlling factor of et the drivers of the et components and their effects on the trends and variability of et in the tp have been rarely investigated wang et al 2018 therefore it is critical to comprehensively understand the variations and drivers of et and its components in the tp in this study the spatiotemporal variations in et and its components at the annual and seasonal scales are investigated meanwhile the contributions of the et components to the et trends are revealed and the responses of et and its components to the environmental factors in the tp are discussed this study not only improves our understanding of the hydrological cycle but also elucidates the response of et and its components to climate change and vegetation greening thus providing crucial information for water resource management 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the tp 25 8 39 8 n 73 4 104 6 e covering an area of approximately 2 95 106 km2 fig 1 is located in southwest china it is the source region of several major rivers such as the yangtze yellow indus ganges salween brahmaputra and mekong rivers the elevation decreases gradually from northwest to southeast with an average elevation of more than 4000 m the mean annual average temperature is 2 3 c ranging from 18 1 21 3 c which was obtained from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd during 1982 2015 the mean annual precipitation is 411 mm based on the average of precipitation data by cmfd and cn051 during 1982 2015 spatially the temperature and precipitation gradually decrease from northwest to southeast the climate has a unique plateau climate owing to the elevated mass of the plateau and its subdued and rolling surface du et al 2004 the study area is predominantly controlled by the indian summer monsoons in the warm season may september and by the westerlies in the cold season tian et al 2007 to further elucidate the response of et to climate change and vegetation greening the area was divided into five climatic zones based on the aridity index ai of the tp fig s1 the ai is defined as the ratio of the multiyear mean precipitation to multiyear mean potential evapotranspiration more than 70 of the tp is characterized by an arid and semi arid climate 2 2 data 2 2 1 evapotranspiration data there are many et datasets i e mu et al 2011 ma et al 2019 han et al 2021b ma et al 2022 which have been validated in the tp song et al 2017 chang et al 2018 liu 2018 yang et al 2021 2022 extensive research has demonstrated that the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam v3 5a martens et al 2017 can provide a reliable long term et dataset which has been validated based on in situ observations and the water balance method for the tp li et al 2019 liu 2018 yang et al 2021 2022 therefore the gleam et data are suitable for exploring the spatiotemporal patterns of et in the tp the gleam et data are a global et dataset based on satellite and reanalysis data covering the 41 yr period from 1980 to 2020 martens et al 2017 https www gleam eu accessed on 15 ma 2022 the gleam et components i e canopy transpiration soil evaporation interception loss open water evaporation and sublimation separately use a set of algorithms based on the priestley taylor equation the gleam et data have a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and daily monthly and yearly temporal resolutions previous studies have demonstrated that gleam et data can be used to describe the spatiotemporal variations of et in the tp liu 2018 li et al 2019 in this study the newly released gleam v3 5a et data from 1982 to 2015 were adopted more detailed information regarding the gleam data can be found in martens et al 2017 2 2 2 meteorological data daily meteorological data including precipitation temperature downward shortwave radiation wind speed and specific humidity were obtained from cmfd which was developed by the hydrometeorological research group at the institute of tibetan plateau research chinese academy of sciences he et al 2020 http data tpdc ac cn zh hans the cmfd was created through the fusion of in situ observations remote sensing products and reanalysis data it covers all of china from 1979 to 2018 with a spatial resolution of 0 1 and temporal resolutions of 3 h monthly and yearly the cmfd has been validated against in situ observations and compared with other reanalysis datasets for the tp which demonstrated that it is one of the best meteorological datasets in the tp xue et al 2013 wang et al 2020 ma and zhang 2022 considering the large uncertainties in the precipitation data the cn051 precipitation data were also applied cn051 was developed by the national climate center of the china meteorological administration with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and temporal resolutions of daily monthly and yearly therefore the ensemble mean of these two precipitation datasets was used in this study the wind speed values used in this study were at a height of 2 m which needed to be converted from the wind speed at 10 m in the cmfd brutsaert 2005 1 w s u 10 2 10 1 7 multiyear precipitation data for calculating the ai values were obtained from the china meteorological data service center cmdc for the period of 1960 2017 potential evapotranspiration was calculated by the penman monteith equation using cmdc data during 1960 2017 chang et al 2022 the ai values for the whole region were obtained through interpolation 2 2 3 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data the global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data https glam1 gsfc nasa gov pinzon and tucker 2014 were used to examine the effects of vegetation changes on et these data cover the period of 1981 2015 with a spatial resolution of 0 083 0 083 and a 15 d temporal resolution the gimms ndvi data have been widely used in previous studies wang et al 2021 yang et al 2020 chen et al 2022a 2022b 2 2 4 soil moisture sm data the gleam soil moisture sm data were used to analyze the influence of soil water on et the gleam sm data were developed by assimilating the observations of soil moisture into the soil profile using a multilayer running water balance it covers the global region from 1980 to 2020 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and daily monthly and yearly temporal resolutions the gleam sm data have been widely used in previous studies and validated against observations in various ecosystems guillod et al 2015 chen et al 2022a 2022b two soil layers at the depths of 0 10 cm and 10 100 cm were used to produce sm data while the depth of 100 cm below the surface is considered as the root zone depth the current study used the root zone soil moisture data obtained from the gleam v3 5a dataset all the data including et and environmental variables within the overlapping period 1982 2015 were used in this study to reduce the uncertainty caused by inconsistent spatial resolutions of all variables all the data were resampled into a uniform spatial resolution 0 1 0 1 and aggregated to seasonal and annual values the annual and seasonal values of et and p were summed by monthly values while that of other variables can be obtained from weighted average of monthly values this study mainly discussed the terrestrial evapotranspiration while lake evaporation was excluded 2 3 methods the linear least squares regression method was used to investigate trends of et and environmental variables chang et al 2022 an f test was conducted to analyze whether the trend was significant at the 95 or 99 confidence levels sun et al 2020 to compare the trends of et and environmental variables all the variables were normalized using the z score normalization method 2 z i x i x σ where x i is the et or environmental variable data in the ith year x and σ are the mean and standard deviation of x respectively and z i is the normalized x in the ith year the statistical significance of the trend was evaluated by mann kendal statistical test mann 1945 kendall 1975 to calculate the sensitivities of the variations in et to environmental variables a multiple linear regression analysis method was used 3 y γ p p δ q q φ s m sm η s r a d srad ψ t a ta κ w s ws τ n d v i ndvi ε where y is the area averaged et p q sm srad ta ws and ndvi are the area averaged precipitation specific humidity soil moisture solar radiation temperature wind speed and ndvi respectively γ p δ q φ sm η srad ψ ta κ ws and τ ndvi are the fitted regression coefficients and ε is the residual error all the variables were normalized before using the multiple linear regression analysis the regression coefficients can be regarded as the sensitivities of et to these variables piao et al 2013 higher regression coefficient represents higher sensitivity of et to the variable to determine the dominant factor influencing the et in the tp a partial correlation analysis was applied between et and one variable after statistically controlling for the changes in other variables sun et al 2020 the variable with the highest partial correlation coefficient was considered to be the dominant factor 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variations in et and its components the spatial distribution of the multiyear 1982 2015 mean annual et and its components es ec and ei in the tp fig 2 suggests that a significant spatial pattern exists the multiyear mean annual et decreased from southeast to the northwest of the tp fig 2a the spatial patterns of ec and ei were similar to those of et the proportion of es to et decreased and those of ec and ei to et increased as the climate zone shifted from aridity to humidity the maximum et appeared in the southeastern tp whereas a minimum et which was lower than 100 mm appeared in the qaidam basin of the tp fig 2a regionally the annual mean et was 300 1 mm varying from 269 9 to 322 3 mm ec accounted for the largest proportion of the et components with an average value of 158 3 mm followed by es 103 3 mm and ei 32 mm the spatial distribution of the trend analysis suggests that 97 7 of the area showed a positive et trend while decreasing et trends appeared in some southern and eastern regions fig 3 the trend of ec was larger than that of es and ei thus ec provided a higher contribution to the et variations than the other components similarly the positive trends in es and ec accounted for approximately 81 9 and 74 of the total area respectively however only 31 1 of the regions showed a positive trend in ei the increasing trends of es were primarily located in the northern western and central tp whereas decreasing trends appeared in the southeastern tp the regionally averaged et in the tp had a significant positive trend of 1 36 mm yr 1 p 0 01 whereas et components showed positive trends with a smaller magnitude than those of et fig 4 the spatial patterns of the et trends varied during each season fig 5 although the seasonal et in each season exhibited increasing trends the magnitudes of the trends were substantially different the rate of increase in et was the greatest in summer june august with a value of 0 51 mm yr 1 followed by spring march may autumn september november and winter december january and february with values of 0 41 0 34 and 0 12 mm yr 1 respectively fig 5 3 2 trends of environmental variables to analyze the contributions of the environmental variables to the et change a trend analysis was also performed on the environmental variables ta srad q ndvi p sm and ws all the environmental variables demonstrated varying trends at annual and seasonal scales table 1 the annual p significantly increased at a rate of 1 747 mm yr 1 whereas the annual srad and ws significantly decreased at rates of 0 099 w m 2 yr 1 and 0 005 m s 1 yr 1 respectively consistent with the increases in p and sm the annual et increased significantly the annual ta exhibited a significant positive trend with a slope of 0 045 c yr 1 p 0 01 the annual q showed similar trends to that of ta with a significant positive increase of 0 00001 yr 1 p 0 01 the annual ndvi significantly increased at a rate of 0 002 yr 1 indicating that the tp is undergoing greening seasonal p increased significantly p 0 05 except in autumn the increasing trends of ta q and sm were significant in summer autumn and winter p 0 05 the ws trend was positive in winter whereas it decreased in other seasons srad increased in spring but decreased in other seasons the increasing trends in sm and ndvi were significant in summer autumn and winter p 0 05 the ndvi trend indicates that vegetation greening has occurred over the past decades in addition the environmental variables also presented different trends in different zones table 2 annual p increased significantly in the dry zones and decreased in the humid zones annual ta q and sm showed positive trends in all zones whereas srad and ws showed negative trends the annual ndvi decreased in humid zones whereas it increased in the other zones since the humid zone accounts for a small proportion of the whole plateau area the increasing ndvi trend appeared in most regions 3 3 environmental variables driving area averaged et for different climatic regions to explore the driving mechanism of the environmental variables on area averaged et and its components for different ai ranges a multiple regression method was used for the five climatic zones the annual et was significantly and positively correlated with sm and ta while the other variables produced limited effects on et fig 6a as the major component of et the drivers of the annual ec were similar to those of et whereas the annual es and ei were primarily affected by sm in addition annual et and its components were affected by different environmental factors in the different climatic zones fig 6 in the arid zone the effects of sm and p on the annual et were significant and larger than those of ndvi and ws whereas ta srad and q exhibited limited effects on et fig 6a the impacts of sm on es and ec were significant and the highest fig 6b c whereas sm produced significantly negative effects on ei fig 6d in the semi arid zone ta had the largest impact on annual et followed by sm the annual es was positively sensitive to ta and negatively sensitive to ws and srad the annual ec was more sensitive to sm ndvi and ta whereas the annual ei was more sensitive to sm and p in the dry semi humid zone the annual et was the most sensitive to ta whereas the other variables had negative effects on et fig 6a the annual es was more sensitive to sm and q whereas the effects of ta and p on the annual ec were significant in the semi humid zone the effect of ta on the annual et was the largest whereas p had a significant negative effect on et the annual es was the most sensitive to q whereas the effects of ta and p on the annual ec were larger than those of the other variables the annual ei was the most sensitive to ta followed by sm in the humid zone the annual et was significantly sensitive to ws ta and ndvi as a major component of et in the humid zone ec was the most sensitive to ws whereas the effects of sm and ndvi on es were negative and significant the annual ei was the most sensitive to ws and ta followed by sm and ndvi therefore the effects of the environmental variables on et predominantly depended on the integrated effects of the environmental variables on the et components moreover the sensitivities of et to the environmental variables varied across climatic zones and seasons fig 7 in spring the et was significantly affected by ta and sm the spring et was the most sensitive to ta and sm in the arid zone and to ta in other zones fig 7a the summer et was primarily positively correlated with sm and srad whereas ws exhibited a significantly negative effect the summer et in the arid and semi arid zone was more significantly affected by sm and p fig 7b the summer et was the most sensitive to p and sm followed by ndvi and ws in the semi arid zone whereas it was the most sensitive to ta in other zones the autumn et was mainly determined by ta and sm the autumn et was the most sensitive to sm srad ta and ndvi in the arid zone fig 7c whereas the et was significantly and positively correlated with ta in other zones the effect of ta on winter et was significantly larger than that of the other variables although the et was the most sensitive to sm in the arid zone fig 7d overall the most sensitive variable for the seasonal et except summer et in the different zones was similar to that for the annual et whereas the most sensitive variable for the summer et varied across climatic zones on a regional scale the summer et was more sensitive to sm whereas the sensitivity of ta was the highest during other seasons because the summer et comprised a high proportion of the annual et the most sensitive variable for the annual et was consistent with that of the summer et 3 4 contributions of dominant environmental variables to the variations in et 3 4 1 spatial distributions of the contributions of environmental variables to et the dominant contribution factor in each grid was determined according to the annual and seasonal contributions of each variable to the et variations figs 8 and 9 and the percentage of grids attributed to each variable was also determined tables 3 and 4 on the annual scale sm was the primary contributing factor covering 44 39 of the study area which was mainly located in the central and northern tp fig 8 table 3 ta was the dominant factor responsible for 32 5 of the study area mostly in the eastern tp ndvi was the primary control variable in the margin of the brahmaputra basin accounting for 7 18 of the total grids p made the primary contribution in some regions of the central tp and the qaidam basin accounting for 5 89 of the study area the annual es and ec were primarily controlled by sm and were located in the central and northern tp ta was the main contributing factor to the annual es and ec mostly near the sources of the sanjiangyuan in the southeastern tp q was the dominant factor for the annual es covering 13 6 of the total grids ndvi was mainly controlled by ec and ei which were located in some regions of the yellow yangtze and salween rivers and the inner tp the patterns of the dominant contributions of the environmental variables to et varied across seasons fig 9 table 4 in spring sm was the main contributing factor accounting for 43 68 of the total grids predominantly located in the central and northwestern tp the spring et was dominated by ta in the eastern tp accounting for 33 58 of the total grids whereas p was the primary contributing factor in the middle of the qaidam region in summer the et was dominated by sm in the western tp accounting for 54 41 of the total grids srad was the main influencing factor of summer et in the eastern tp whereas ta was the primary contributing variable in the salween and yangtze regions the autumn et was dominated by sm or ta in most regions of the tp in winter sm made the primary contribution to the central and northern tp accounting for 40 56 of the total grids whereas et was controlled by ta in the eastern tp and by ws in some regions of the yellow basin 3 4 2 contributions of dominant environmental variables for different climatic zones regionally the contributions of the environmental variables to annual et and its components varied according to different climatic regions fig 10 sm was the dominant contributor to the changes in the annual et in the arid and semi arid zones and its contribution decreased as the climate transited from aridity to humidity ta became the main driver of the changes in the annual et in other zones fig 10a sm was the main driver of the changes in the annual es in arid zone while ta or q became the dominant driver in other zones fig 10b the controlling variables to annual ec were similar to that of et fig 10c the annual ei was controlled by the comprehensive role of all the variables in the different climatic zones fig 10d notably the ndvi played a key role in the changes in the annual ec and ei which cannot be ignored on the seasonal scale sm was the main contributor in the arid and semi arid zones fig 11 the contributions of ta to the change in et in spring autumn and winter increased as the climate shifted from aridity to humidity while srad became the dominant driver of the change in summer et 4 discussion 4 1 performance of gleam et in tp an accurate estimation of et and its partitioning is essential for understanding water and energy balances gleam et has been validated as one of the best products in many regions i e qilian mountains tp china and global jia et al 2022 li et al 2022 liu 2018 yang et al 2021 2022 though the gleam et was slightly underestimated at the site scale yang et al 2021 it showed a high accuracy and performed best at the basin scale in the tp fig s2 liu et al 2018 therefore the gleam et is relatively robust and reliable in this study moreover another advantage of the gleam et data is that the algorithm considers the effect of sm on et where sm can directly influences et processes gleam et performed well and could capture the dynamics of et however large differences in et partitioning existed among different et products and models i e penman monteith leuning pml model and simple terrestrial hydrosphere model sith wang et al 2018 chen et al 2022a 2022b for example ec was the major component of et in this study whereas es was the dominant component in wang et al 2018 and ma and zhang 2022 in the tp chen et al 2022a 2022b pointed out that gleam ignored the estimation of soil evaporation under vegetation canopy which caused the underestimation of es therefore the lower ratio of es et and higher ratio of ec et of gleam could be expected compared to those in ma and zhang 2022 the sources for the differences of et components estimated by gleam and other models i e pml and sith lies in the differences of model structure forcing data and parameterization schemes for example the pml model coupled water energy balance and considered biophysical mechanism however it ignored the effect of soil moisture on et components which would induce uncertainty in the estimation of et components both gleam and sith consider the control of soil moisture on et processes whereas different stress functions of transpiration are adopted therefore future studies which focus on the validation of et components are still needed 4 2 patterns and variations in et and its components extensive research has evaluated et using different models in the tp e g song et al 2017 wang et al 2018 ma and zhang 2022 while few studies have analyzed et partitioning and the driving mechanisms one of the main objectives of this study was to clarify the et components and quantify their driving factors for the tp the spatial distribution of the multiyear 1982 2015 et and its components ei ec and es presented strong spatial heterogeneity and latitudinal gradients which was similar to that reported by wang et al 2018 and ma and zhang 2022 who analyzed et for 1982 2012 and 1982 2016 respectively this indicates that the spatial distribution of the long term variations in et over the tp was stable in this study ec was the dominant component of et in the tp accounting for more than 52 of the total et this is similar to the findings of kool et al 2014 who suggested that ec was the major component on the global scale however ma and zhang 2022 suggested that es was a more significant component of et in the tp thus the underestimation of es by gleam could be expected due to the ignorance of es under the canopy chen et al 2022a 2022b however due to limited et components observations there is no consensus for et components estimation although the spatial patterns of et and its components were similar to those in previous studies substantial differences in the magnitude and inter annual variability of et existed in the tp yao et al 2013 li et al 2014 song et al 2017 wang et al 2018 ma and zhang 2022 different model structures forcing data and study periods result in discrepancies among different studies the spatial distribution of the trends of annual et and its components demonstrated spatial heterogeneity the et and its components exhibited increasing trends over most of the tp fig 3 this is similar to the findings of wang et al 2013 and who found that the et increased significantly across the tp the area averaged et exhibited an increasing trend in this study which is consistent with previous studies yin et al 2013 sun et al 2020 lin et al 2021 ma and zhang 2022 however several studies have reported that the et in the tp decreased during 2000 2010 song et al 2017 therefore different time series and models may produce different results for et trends in the tp 4 3 dominant environmental variables affecting changes in et and components spatially the dominant variables affecting the annual et and its components varied in the western tp the annual et was strongly correlated with sm this is consistent with wang et al 2018 who suggested that the et variations were predominantly related to variations in the available water supply in severely water limited regions in the eastern tp et was mainly controlled by ta and srad indicating that et was mainly controlled by the energy factor in areas with better water conditions similar to the results of lin et al 2021 and ma and zhang 2022 the increasing trend of es in the western tp could be attributed to the increasing sm or p while the decreasing trend in the eastern tp may have been due to the decline in q or ta this is likely due to the fact that the western tp is a water limited region while the eastern tp is an energy limited region in addition degenerating permafrost may be an important factor affecting the increase in es in the central and western tp wang et al 2018 the permafrost degradation is accelerating with climate warming which may lead to an increase in et huang et al 2022 in the central and western tp where the proportion of ec to et was small the increased ec was mainly controlled by sm or p while ndvi played a limited role due to its small value in the eastern tp where the proportion of ec to et was large the increased ec may have been due to the increasing ta and srad while vegetation greening played a more substantial role in the eastern tp where ndvi is relatively higher the increasing trend of ei may have been due to the increasing ta and ndvi the dominant environmental variables driving the change in area averaged et and its components were different with those driving et at specific spatial scales regionally the increasing sm was the dominant variable for the increasing et while the increasing ta also played a secondary role in the variations in et indicating that wetting and warming are the main drivers for the increasing et in the tp this result is consistent with that of sun et al 2020 who indicated that the increased et was primarily caused by the wetting and warming climate in the tp moreover mcvicar et al 2012 demonstrated that et was mainly controlled by the water supply in the tp whereas ws had a limited influence on et however inconsistent results have been reported in previous studies chen et al 2014 shen et al 2015 wang et al 2018 ma and zhang 2022 notably these studies ignored the effects of soil moisture in fact precipitation directly affects sm through infiltration and thus affects et particularly in arid and semi arid zones annual p showed a significant correlation with sm especially when annual p was lower than 350 mm fig s3 meng et al 2017 also demonstrated that a high correlation between precipitation and sm existed in the tp therefore it is believed that the et is mainly controlled by the available water supply p or sm besides the dominant variables for the et components varied due to different physical and physiological processes the variations in es and ei were highly governed by sm which is similar to the results of wang et al 2018 who stated that es and ei were controlled by p the variations in the annual ec were significantly affected by ta and sm which contrasts the results of wang et al 2018 who suggested that lai was the controlling factor for ec variation in fact vegetation greening could enhance et via the biophysical processes and modulate the hydrological processes in the tp however the small change in ndvi over the entire tp limited its effect on et moreover different attribution methods may also be the source of this difference ma and zhang 2022 wang et al 2018 used the stepwise regression method to identify the controlling factors which may omit the contributions of other factors the most reasonable method is to comprehensively analyze the contribution of each factor as stated in this study 4 4 uncertainties and limitations although previous studies have validated the good performance of gleam et data in regional comparisons e g martens et al 2017 yang et al 2017 bai and liu 2018 li et al 2019 yang et al 2021 some limitations and uncertainties remain in the model accuracy and attribution analysis and the simplification of the physical processes may be one of the reasons for this the effect of carbon dioxide co2 which can affect et via stomatal conductance zhang et al 2019 is not considered in this model uncertainties in the model input data can also cause uncertainty in the model accuracy owing to the scarce observations in the tp moreover owing to the uncertainty and mismatch resolutions of the forcing data the results of the sensitivity and attribution analyses may produce uncertainty in addition the sensitivities of et and its components to the environmental variables were identified based on the assumption that each variable was independent in fact environmental variables may not always be completely independent and their interactions may cause uncertainty in the sensitivity analysis previous studies have evaluated the et components using various methods in the tp hu et al 2009 zhu et al 2013 wang et al 2018 while observations of et partitioning are extremely scarce especially in the western tp therefore it is essential to obtain more observations of the et components using stable isotopes or sap flow methods to validate the model accuracy for the et components 5 conclusions the variations and trends of the multiyear et and its components in the tp were evaluated based on the gleam et data the drivers and controls of et and its components were also quantified the conclusions are as follows 1 the spatial pattern of et and its components were significant the multiyear mean annual et was 300 1 mm yr 1 which was mainly comprised of es followed by ec and ei in the tp the et increased significantly at a rate of 1 36 mm yr 1 whereas its components increased with smaller magnitudes 2 spatially the annual et was primarily controlled by sm in the central and western tp whereas it was determined by ta in the remaining regions the contribution of sm decreased as the area changed from arid to humid and ta became the dominant contributor in areas with more abundant water conditions ndvi played an important role in regulating et which could not be ignored 3 regionally the increased averaged et was primarily caused by sm followed by ta indicating that wetting and warming were the dominant factors driving the annual et in the tp there were substantial differences in the driving factors of environmental variables for the variations in et and its components in different climatic zones this study provides a better understanding of the drivers and controls of the environmental variables on et and its components which is of great significance in elucidating the mechanisms of the hydrological cycle in the tp credit authorship contribution statement yaping chang

7627,study region the tibetan plateau study focus evapotranspiration et plays a critical role in the water balance energy budget and carbon cycle however the variations trends and controls of et on the tibetan plateau tp are poorly understood because of uncertainties in et estimates and sparse observations in this study the variations in et and its components and their drivers and controls in the tp were analyzed at seasonal and annual scales during 1982 2015 new hydrological insights for the region spatially the multiyear mean annual et decreased from the southeastern to northwestern tp canopy transpiration ec was the main component of et 52 7 followed by soil evaporation es 34 4 and interception ei 10 7 regionally the averaged et and its components increased significantly at the seasonal and annual scales spatially the controlling factor for et changed from water to energy as the climatic zones transferred from aridity to humidity the annual et was controlled by soil moisture sm in arid and semi arid zones whereas ta was the dominant factor in the other regions the increased annual es and ei were primarily caused by sm while the annual ec was determined by ta in addition ndvi played a certain role in regulating the annual ec and ei variations this study improves our understanding of hydrological processes and water resource management under global climate change graphical abstract ga1 keywords evapotranspiration contribution analysis climate change vegetation greening tibetan plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et which consists of soil evaporation es canopy transpiration ec and canopy interception ei not only plays a critical role in the water balance but is also a key element in energy and carbon cycles jung et al 2010 chang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 the global et has shown a significant increasing trend in recent years zeng et al 2012 bai and liu 2018 xu et al 2019 an increase in et and a shift in precipitation distribution have accelerated the hydrological cycles under global and regional climate change huntington 2006 habeeb et al 2019 as one of the most challenging aspects of water and energy balance analyses the accurate assessment of the spatiotemporal dynamics of et and its drivers is essential to fully understand the eco hydrological processes and predict potential changes in the hydrological cycle song et al 2017 especially in the context of changing environments many studies have evaluated the spatiotemporal variations in et based on remote sensing in situ observations reanalysis data and land surface models mueller et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 sun et al 2020 however owing to the substantial uncertainties in et estimations there is no consistent conclusion on the drivers and controls of et at regional and global scales mueller et al 2013 li et al 2018 wartenburger et al 2018 especially in complex terrain regions such as the tibetan plateau tp in addition different et components can show contrasting responses to environmental drivers due to the differences in physical and physiological processes underlying these components tsuruta et al 2016 moreover the controlling factors of et varied significantly at different temporal and spatial scales i e scott and biederman 2019 han et al 2021a thus the driving mechanism needs to be comprehensively investigated in detail therefore it is essential to fully understand the driving mechanisms of et and its partitioning which contributes to interpreting the hydrological dynamics assessing the ecosystem evolution and providing suggestions for water management the tp known as the third pole and the world of roof is the headwater region of many major rivers in asia and is exceptionally sensitive to climate change immerzeel et al 2010 it has experienced significant warming and greening over the past few decades yao et al 2019 wang et al 2021 although previous studies have evaluated the spatiotemporal variations and controls of et in the tp using various models song et al 2017 wang et al 2018 sun et al 2020 ma and zhang 2022 there is no consensus on the drivers and controls of et for example some studies have suggested that et is controlled predominantly by soil moisture or precipitation yin et al 2013 song et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 ma and zhang 2022 while other studies have demonstrated that et is also controlled by other environmental variables wang et al 2018 sun et al 2020 even the factors influencing the temporal trends in et may be different from those controlling the spatial distributions of et which needs further investigation apart from the controlling factor of et the drivers of the et components and their effects on the trends and variability of et in the tp have been rarely investigated wang et al 2018 therefore it is critical to comprehensively understand the variations and drivers of et and its components in the tp in this study the spatiotemporal variations in et and its components at the annual and seasonal scales are investigated meanwhile the contributions of the et components to the et trends are revealed and the responses of et and its components to the environmental factors in the tp are discussed this study not only improves our understanding of the hydrological cycle but also elucidates the response of et and its components to climate change and vegetation greening thus providing crucial information for water resource management 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the tp 25 8 39 8 n 73 4 104 6 e covering an area of approximately 2 95 106 km2 fig 1 is located in southwest china it is the source region of several major rivers such as the yangtze yellow indus ganges salween brahmaputra and mekong rivers the elevation decreases gradually from northwest to southeast with an average elevation of more than 4000 m the mean annual average temperature is 2 3 c ranging from 18 1 21 3 c which was obtained from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd during 1982 2015 the mean annual precipitation is 411 mm based on the average of precipitation data by cmfd and cn051 during 1982 2015 spatially the temperature and precipitation gradually decrease from northwest to southeast the climate has a unique plateau climate owing to the elevated mass of the plateau and its subdued and rolling surface du et al 2004 the study area is predominantly controlled by the indian summer monsoons in the warm season may september and by the westerlies in the cold season tian et al 2007 to further elucidate the response of et to climate change and vegetation greening the area was divided into five climatic zones based on the aridity index ai of the tp fig s1 the ai is defined as the ratio of the multiyear mean precipitation to multiyear mean potential evapotranspiration more than 70 of the tp is characterized by an arid and semi arid climate 2 2 data 2 2 1 evapotranspiration data there are many et datasets i e mu et al 2011 ma et al 2019 han et al 2021b ma et al 2022 which have been validated in the tp song et al 2017 chang et al 2018 liu 2018 yang et al 2021 2022 extensive research has demonstrated that the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam v3 5a martens et al 2017 can provide a reliable long term et dataset which has been validated based on in situ observations and the water balance method for the tp li et al 2019 liu 2018 yang et al 2021 2022 therefore the gleam et data are suitable for exploring the spatiotemporal patterns of et in the tp the gleam et data are a global et dataset based on satellite and reanalysis data covering the 41 yr period from 1980 to 2020 martens et al 2017 https www gleam eu accessed on 15 ma 2022 the gleam et components i e canopy transpiration soil evaporation interception loss open water evaporation and sublimation separately use a set of algorithms based on the priestley taylor equation the gleam et data have a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and daily monthly and yearly temporal resolutions previous studies have demonstrated that gleam et data can be used to describe the spatiotemporal variations of et in the tp liu 2018 li et al 2019 in this study the newly released gleam v3 5a et data from 1982 to 2015 were adopted more detailed information regarding the gleam data can be found in martens et al 2017 2 2 2 meteorological data daily meteorological data including precipitation temperature downward shortwave radiation wind speed and specific humidity were obtained from cmfd which was developed by the hydrometeorological research group at the institute of tibetan plateau research chinese academy of sciences he et al 2020 http data tpdc ac cn zh hans the cmfd was created through the fusion of in situ observations remote sensing products and reanalysis data it covers all of china from 1979 to 2018 with a spatial resolution of 0 1 and temporal resolutions of 3 h monthly and yearly the cmfd has been validated against in situ observations and compared with other reanalysis datasets for the tp which demonstrated that it is one of the best meteorological datasets in the tp xue et al 2013 wang et al 2020 ma and zhang 2022 considering the large uncertainties in the precipitation data the cn051 precipitation data were also applied cn051 was developed by the national climate center of the china meteorological administration with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and temporal resolutions of daily monthly and yearly therefore the ensemble mean of these two precipitation datasets was used in this study the wind speed values used in this study were at a height of 2 m which needed to be converted from the wind speed at 10 m in the cmfd brutsaert 2005 1 w s u 10 2 10 1 7 multiyear precipitation data for calculating the ai values were obtained from the china meteorological data service center cmdc for the period of 1960 2017 potential evapotranspiration was calculated by the penman monteith equation using cmdc data during 1960 2017 chang et al 2022 the ai values for the whole region were obtained through interpolation 2 2 3 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data the global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data https glam1 gsfc nasa gov pinzon and tucker 2014 were used to examine the effects of vegetation changes on et these data cover the period of 1981 2015 with a spatial resolution of 0 083 0 083 and a 15 d temporal resolution the gimms ndvi data have been widely used in previous studies wang et al 2021 yang et al 2020 chen et al 2022a 2022b 2 2 4 soil moisture sm data the gleam soil moisture sm data were used to analyze the influence of soil water on et the gleam sm data were developed by assimilating the observations of soil moisture into the soil profile using a multilayer running water balance it covers the global region from 1980 to 2020 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and daily monthly and yearly temporal resolutions the gleam sm data have been widely used in previous studies and validated against observations in various ecosystems guillod et al 2015 chen et al 2022a 2022b two soil layers at the depths of 0 10 cm and 10 100 cm were used to produce sm data while the depth of 100 cm below the surface is considered as the root zone depth the current study used the root zone soil moisture data obtained from the gleam v3 5a dataset all the data including et and environmental variables within the overlapping period 1982 2015 were used in this study to reduce the uncertainty caused by inconsistent spatial resolutions of all variables all the data were resampled into a uniform spatial resolution 0 1 0 1 and aggregated to seasonal and annual values the annual and seasonal values of et and p were summed by monthly values while that of other variables can be obtained from weighted average of monthly values this study mainly discussed the terrestrial evapotranspiration while lake evaporation was excluded 2 3 methods the linear least squares regression method was used to investigate trends of et and environmental variables chang et al 2022 an f test was conducted to analyze whether the trend was significant at the 95 or 99 confidence levels sun et al 2020 to compare the trends of et and environmental variables all the variables were normalized using the z score normalization method 2 z i x i x σ where x i is the et or environmental variable data in the ith year x and σ are the mean and standard deviation of x respectively and z i is the normalized x in the ith year the statistical significance of the trend was evaluated by mann kendal statistical test mann 1945 kendall 1975 to calculate the sensitivities of the variations in et to environmental variables a multiple linear regression analysis method was used 3 y γ p p δ q q φ s m sm η s r a d srad ψ t a ta κ w s ws τ n d v i ndvi ε where y is the area averaged et p q sm srad ta ws and ndvi are the area averaged precipitation specific humidity soil moisture solar radiation temperature wind speed and ndvi respectively γ p δ q φ sm η srad ψ ta κ ws and τ ndvi are the fitted regression coefficients and ε is the residual error all the variables were normalized before using the multiple linear regression analysis the regression coefficients can be regarded as the sensitivities of et to these variables piao et al 2013 higher regression coefficient represents higher sensitivity of et to the variable to determine the dominant factor influencing the et in the tp a partial correlation analysis was applied between et and one variable after statistically controlling for the changes in other variables sun et al 2020 the variable with the highest partial correlation coefficient was considered to be the dominant factor 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variations in et and its components the spatial distribution of the multiyear 1982 2015 mean annual et and its components es ec and ei in the tp fig 2 suggests that a significant spatial pattern exists the multiyear mean annual et decreased from southeast to the northwest of the tp fig 2a the spatial patterns of ec and ei were similar to those of et the proportion of es to et decreased and those of ec and ei to et increased as the climate zone shifted from aridity to humidity the maximum et appeared in the southeastern tp whereas a minimum et which was lower than 100 mm appeared in the qaidam basin of the tp fig 2a regionally the annual mean et was 300 1 mm varying from 269 9 to 322 3 mm ec accounted for the largest proportion of the et components with an average value of 158 3 mm followed by es 103 3 mm and ei 32 mm the spatial distribution of the trend analysis suggests that 97 7 of the area showed a positive et trend while decreasing et trends appeared in some southern and eastern regions fig 3 the trend of ec was larger than that of es and ei thus ec provided a higher contribution to the et variations than the other components similarly the positive trends in es and ec accounted for approximately 81 9 and 74 of the total area respectively however only 31 1 of the regions showed a positive trend in ei the increasing trends of es were primarily located in the northern western and central tp whereas decreasing trends appeared in the southeastern tp the regionally averaged et in the tp had a significant positive trend of 1 36 mm yr 1 p 0 01 whereas et components showed positive trends with a smaller magnitude than those of et fig 4 the spatial patterns of the et trends varied during each season fig 5 although the seasonal et in each season exhibited increasing trends the magnitudes of the trends were substantially different the rate of increase in et was the greatest in summer june august with a value of 0 51 mm yr 1 followed by spring march may autumn september november and winter december january and february with values of 0 41 0 34 and 0 12 mm yr 1 respectively fig 5 3 2 trends of environmental variables to analyze the contributions of the environmental variables to the et change a trend analysis was also performed on the environmental variables ta srad q ndvi p sm and ws all the environmental variables demonstrated varying trends at annual and seasonal scales table 1 the annual p significantly increased at a rate of 1 747 mm yr 1 whereas the annual srad and ws significantly decreased at rates of 0 099 w m 2 yr 1 and 0 005 m s 1 yr 1 respectively consistent with the increases in p and sm the annual et increased significantly the annual ta exhibited a significant positive trend with a slope of 0 045 c yr 1 p 0 01 the annual q showed similar trends to that of ta with a significant positive increase of 0 00001 yr 1 p 0 01 the annual ndvi significantly increased at a rate of 0 002 yr 1 indicating that the tp is undergoing greening seasonal p increased significantly p 0 05 except in autumn the increasing trends of ta q and sm were significant in summer autumn and winter p 0 05 the ws trend was positive in winter whereas it decreased in other seasons srad increased in spring but decreased in other seasons the increasing trends in sm and ndvi were significant in summer autumn and winter p 0 05 the ndvi trend indicates that vegetation greening has occurred over the past decades in addition the environmental variables also presented different trends in different zones table 2 annual p increased significantly in the dry zones and decreased in the humid zones annual ta q and sm showed positive trends in all zones whereas srad and ws showed negative trends the annual ndvi decreased in humid zones whereas it increased in the other zones since the humid zone accounts for a small proportion of the whole plateau area the increasing ndvi trend appeared in most regions 3 3 environmental variables driving area averaged et for different climatic regions to explore the driving mechanism of the environmental variables on area averaged et and its components for different ai ranges a multiple regression method was used for the five climatic zones the annual et was significantly and positively correlated with sm and ta while the other variables produced limited effects on et fig 6a as the major component of et the drivers of the annual ec were similar to those of et whereas the annual es and ei were primarily affected by sm in addition annual et and its components were affected by different environmental factors in the different climatic zones fig 6 in the arid zone the effects of sm and p on the annual et were significant and larger than those of ndvi and ws whereas ta srad and q exhibited limited effects on et fig 6a the impacts of sm on es and ec were significant and the highest fig 6b c whereas sm produced significantly negative effects on ei fig 6d in the semi arid zone ta had the largest impact on annual et followed by sm the annual es was positively sensitive to ta and negatively sensitive to ws and srad the annual ec was more sensitive to sm ndvi and ta whereas the annual ei was more sensitive to sm and p in the dry semi humid zone the annual et was the most sensitive to ta whereas the other variables had negative effects on et fig 6a the annual es was more sensitive to sm and q whereas the effects of ta and p on the annual ec were significant in the semi humid zone the effect of ta on the annual et was the largest whereas p had a significant negative effect on et the annual es was the most sensitive to q whereas the effects of ta and p on the annual ec were larger than those of the other variables the annual ei was the most sensitive to ta followed by sm in the humid zone the annual et was significantly sensitive to ws ta and ndvi as a major component of et in the humid zone ec was the most sensitive to ws whereas the effects of sm and ndvi on es were negative and significant the annual ei was the most sensitive to ws and ta followed by sm and ndvi therefore the effects of the environmental variables on et predominantly depended on the integrated effects of the environmental variables on the et components moreover the sensitivities of et to the environmental variables varied across climatic zones and seasons fig 7 in spring the et was significantly affected by ta and sm the spring et was the most sensitive to ta and sm in the arid zone and to ta in other zones fig 7a the summer et was primarily positively correlated with sm and srad whereas ws exhibited a significantly negative effect the summer et in the arid and semi arid zone was more significantly affected by sm and p fig 7b the summer et was the most sensitive to p and sm followed by ndvi and ws in the semi arid zone whereas it was the most sensitive to ta in other zones the autumn et was mainly determined by ta and sm the autumn et was the most sensitive to sm srad ta and ndvi in the arid zone fig 7c whereas the et was significantly and positively correlated with ta in other zones the effect of ta on winter et was significantly larger than that of the other variables although the et was the most sensitive to sm in the arid zone fig 7d overall the most sensitive variable for the seasonal et except summer et in the different zones was similar to that for the annual et whereas the most sensitive variable for the summer et varied across climatic zones on a regional scale the summer et was more sensitive to sm whereas the sensitivity of ta was the highest during other seasons because the summer et comprised a high proportion of the annual et the most sensitive variable for the annual et was consistent with that of the summer et 3 4 contributions of dominant environmental variables to the variations in et 3 4 1 spatial distributions of the contributions of environmental variables to et the dominant contribution factor in each grid was determined according to the annual and seasonal contributions of each variable to the et variations figs 8 and 9 and the percentage of grids attributed to each variable was also determined tables 3 and 4 on the annual scale sm was the primary contributing factor covering 44 39 of the study area which was mainly located in the central and northern tp fig 8 table 3 ta was the dominant factor responsible for 32 5 of the study area mostly in the eastern tp ndvi was the primary control variable in the margin of the brahmaputra basin accounting for 7 18 of the total grids p made the primary contribution in some regions of the central tp and the qaidam basin accounting for 5 89 of the study area the annual es and ec were primarily controlled by sm and were located in the central and northern tp ta was the main contributing factor to the annual es and ec mostly near the sources of the sanjiangyuan in the southeastern tp q was the dominant factor for the annual es covering 13 6 of the total grids ndvi was mainly controlled by ec and ei which were located in some regions of the yellow yangtze and salween rivers and the inner tp the patterns of the dominant contributions of the environmental variables to et varied across seasons fig 9 table 4 in spring sm was the main contributing factor accounting for 43 68 of the total grids predominantly located in the central and northwestern tp the spring et was dominated by ta in the eastern tp accounting for 33 58 of the total grids whereas p was the primary contributing factor in the middle of the qaidam region in summer the et was dominated by sm in the western tp accounting for 54 41 of the total grids srad was the main influencing factor of summer et in the eastern tp whereas ta was the primary contributing variable in the salween and yangtze regions the autumn et was dominated by sm or ta in most regions of the tp in winter sm made the primary contribution to the central and northern tp accounting for 40 56 of the total grids whereas et was controlled by ta in the eastern tp and by ws in some regions of the yellow basin 3 4 2 contributions of dominant environmental variables for different climatic zones regionally the contributions of the environmental variables to annual et and its components varied according to different climatic regions fig 10 sm was the dominant contributor to the changes in the annual et in the arid and semi arid zones and its contribution decreased as the climate transited from aridity to humidity ta became the main driver of the changes in the annual et in other zones fig 10a sm was the main driver of the changes in the annual es in arid zone while ta or q became the dominant driver in other zones fig 10b the controlling variables to annual ec were similar to that of et fig 10c the annual ei was controlled by the comprehensive role of all the variables in the different climatic zones fig 10d notably the ndvi played a key role in the changes in the annual ec and ei which cannot be ignored on the seasonal scale sm was the main contributor in the arid and semi arid zones fig 11 the contributions of ta to the change in et in spring autumn and winter increased as the climate shifted from aridity to humidity while srad became the dominant driver of the change in summer et 4 discussion 4 1 performance of gleam et in tp an accurate estimation of et and its partitioning is essential for understanding water and energy balances gleam et has been validated as one of the best products in many regions i e qilian mountains tp china and global jia et al 2022 li et al 2022 liu 2018 yang et al 2021 2022 though the gleam et was slightly underestimated at the site scale yang et al 2021 it showed a high accuracy and performed best at the basin scale in the tp fig s2 liu et al 2018 therefore the gleam et is relatively robust and reliable in this study moreover another advantage of the gleam et data is that the algorithm considers the effect of sm on et where sm can directly influences et processes gleam et performed well and could capture the dynamics of et however large differences in et partitioning existed among different et products and models i e penman monteith leuning pml model and simple terrestrial hydrosphere model sith wang et al 2018 chen et al 2022a 2022b for example ec was the major component of et in this study whereas es was the dominant component in wang et al 2018 and ma and zhang 2022 in the tp chen et al 2022a 2022b pointed out that gleam ignored the estimation of soil evaporation under vegetation canopy which caused the underestimation of es therefore the lower ratio of es et and higher ratio of ec et of gleam could be expected compared to those in ma and zhang 2022 the sources for the differences of et components estimated by gleam and other models i e pml and sith lies in the differences of model structure forcing data and parameterization schemes for example the pml model coupled water energy balance and considered biophysical mechanism however it ignored the effect of soil moisture on et components which would induce uncertainty in the estimation of et components both gleam and sith consider the control of soil moisture on et processes whereas different stress functions of transpiration are adopted therefore future studies which focus on the validation of et components are still needed 4 2 patterns and variations in et and its components extensive research has evaluated et using different models in the tp e g song et al 2017 wang et al 2018 ma and zhang 2022 while few studies have analyzed et partitioning and the driving mechanisms one of the main objectives of this study was to clarify the et components and quantify their driving factors for the tp the spatial distribution of the multiyear 1982 2015 et and its components ei ec and es presented strong spatial heterogeneity and latitudinal gradients which was similar to that reported by wang et al 2018 and ma and zhang 2022 who analyzed et for 1982 2012 and 1982 2016 respectively this indicates that the spatial distribution of the long term variations in et over the tp was stable in this study ec was the dominant component of et in the tp accounting for more than 52 of the total et this is similar to the findings of kool et al 2014 who suggested that ec was the major component on the global scale however ma and zhang 2022 suggested that es was a more significant component of et in the tp thus the underestimation of es by gleam could be expected due to the ignorance of es under the canopy chen et al 2022a 2022b however due to limited et components observations there is no consensus for et components estimation although the spatial patterns of et and its components were similar to those in previous studies substantial differences in the magnitude and inter annual variability of et existed in the tp yao et al 2013 li et al 2014 song et al 2017 wang et al 2018 ma and zhang 2022 different model structures forcing data and study periods result in discrepancies among different studies the spatial distribution of the trends of annual et and its components demonstrated spatial heterogeneity the et and its components exhibited increasing trends over most of the tp fig 3 this is similar to the findings of wang et al 2013 and who found that the et increased significantly across the tp the area averaged et exhibited an increasing trend in this study which is consistent with previous studies yin et al 2013 sun et al 2020 lin et al 2021 ma and zhang 2022 however several studies have reported that the et in the tp decreased during 2000 2010 song et al 2017 therefore different time series and models may produce different results for et trends in the tp 4 3 dominant environmental variables affecting changes in et and components spatially the dominant variables affecting the annual et and its components varied in the western tp the annual et was strongly correlated with sm this is consistent with wang et al 2018 who suggested that the et variations were predominantly related to variations in the available water supply in severely water limited regions in the eastern tp et was mainly controlled by ta and srad indicating that et was mainly controlled by the energy factor in areas with better water conditions similar to the results of lin et al 2021 and ma and zhang 2022 the increasing trend of es in the western tp could be attributed to the increasing sm or p while the decreasing trend in the eastern tp may have been due to the decline in q or ta this is likely due to the fact that the western tp is a water limited region while the eastern tp is an energy limited region in addition degenerating permafrost may be an important factor affecting the increase in es in the central and western tp wang et al 2018 the permafrost degradation is accelerating with climate warming which may lead to an increase in et huang et al 2022 in the central and western tp where the proportion of ec to et was small the increased ec was mainly controlled by sm or p while ndvi played a limited role due to its small value in the eastern tp where the proportion of ec to et was large the increased ec may have been due to the increasing ta and srad while vegetation greening played a more substantial role in the eastern tp where ndvi is relatively higher the increasing trend of ei may have been due to the increasing ta and ndvi the dominant environmental variables driving the change in area averaged et and its components were different with those driving et at specific spatial scales regionally the increasing sm was the dominant variable for the increasing et while the increasing ta also played a secondary role in the variations in et indicating that wetting and warming are the main drivers for the increasing et in the tp this result is consistent with that of sun et al 2020 who indicated that the increased et was primarily caused by the wetting and warming climate in the tp moreover mcvicar et al 2012 demonstrated that et was mainly controlled by the water supply in the tp whereas ws had a limited influence on et however inconsistent results have been reported in previous studies chen et al 2014 shen et al 2015 wang et al 2018 ma and zhang 2022 notably these studies ignored the effects of soil moisture in fact precipitation directly affects sm through infiltration and thus affects et particularly in arid and semi arid zones annual p showed a significant correlation with sm especially when annual p was lower than 350 mm fig s3 meng et al 2017 also demonstrated that a high correlation between precipitation and sm existed in the tp therefore it is believed that the et is mainly controlled by the available water supply p or sm besides the dominant variables for the et components varied due to different physical and physiological processes the variations in es and ei were highly governed by sm which is similar to the results of wang et al 2018 who stated that es and ei were controlled by p the variations in the annual ec were significantly affected by ta and sm which contrasts the results of wang et al 2018 who suggested that lai was the controlling factor for ec variation in fact vegetation greening could enhance et via the biophysical processes and modulate the hydrological processes in the tp however the small change in ndvi over the entire tp limited its effect on et moreover different attribution methods may also be the source of this difference ma and zhang 2022 wang et al 2018 used the stepwise regression method to identify the controlling factors which may omit the contributions of other factors the most reasonable method is to comprehensively analyze the contribution of each factor as stated in this study 4 4 uncertainties and limitations although previous studies have validated the good performance of gleam et data in regional comparisons e g martens et al 2017 yang et al 2017 bai and liu 2018 li et al 2019 yang et al 2021 some limitations and uncertainties remain in the model accuracy and attribution analysis and the simplification of the physical processes may be one of the reasons for this the effect of carbon dioxide co2 which can affect et via stomatal conductance zhang et al 2019 is not considered in this model uncertainties in the model input data can also cause uncertainty in the model accuracy owing to the scarce observations in the tp moreover owing to the uncertainty and mismatch resolutions of the forcing data the results of the sensitivity and attribution analyses may produce uncertainty in addition the sensitivities of et and its components to the environmental variables were identified based on the assumption that each variable was independent in fact environmental variables may not always be completely independent and their interactions may cause uncertainty in the sensitivity analysis previous studies have evaluated the et components using various methods in the tp hu et al 2009 zhu et al 2013 wang et al 2018 while observations of et partitioning are extremely scarce especially in the western tp therefore it is essential to obtain more observations of the et components using stable isotopes or sap flow methods to validate the model accuracy for the et components 5 conclusions the variations and trends of the multiyear et and its components in the tp were evaluated based on the gleam et data the drivers and controls of et and its components were also quantified the conclusions are as follows 1 the spatial pattern of et and its components were significant the multiyear mean annual et was 300 1 mm yr 1 which was mainly comprised of es followed by ec and ei in the tp the et increased significantly at a rate of 1 36 mm yr 1 whereas its components increased with smaller magnitudes 2 spatially the annual et was primarily controlled by sm in the central and western tp whereas it was determined by ta in the remaining regions the contribution of sm decreased as the area changed from arid to humid and ta became the dominant contributor in areas with more abundant water conditions ndvi played an important role in regulating et which could not be ignored 3 regionally the increased averaged et was primarily caused by sm followed by ta indicating that wetting and warming were the dominant factors driving the annual et in the tp there were substantial differences in the driving factors of environmental variables for the variations in et and its components in different climatic zones this study provides a better understanding of the drivers and controls of the environmental variables on et and its components which is of great significance in elucidating the mechanisms of the hydrological cycle in the tp credit authorship contribution statement yaping chang

process referred to as regionalization burn and boorman 1993 dalrymple 1960 for predicting most of the hydrologic signatures model independent regionalization methods are adopted that transfers the particular signature either from hydrologically similar watersheds or by establishing a relationship with the catchment s physical and hydro climatic attributes however when continuous hydrograph is required in ungauged watersheds model dependent regionalization is often considered in which parameters of a hydrologic model calibrated in gauged watersheds are transferred to model set up in the ungauged watershed blöschl et al 2013 razavi and coulibaly 2013 the regionalization methods can be broadly categorized into two groups regression based and donor based methods he et al 2011 the regression based method attempts to find a relationship between watershed properties and calibrated model parameters one of the widely used regression based methods is multivariate linear regression mlr wherein a linear regression model is assumed to sufficiently describe the relationship between model parameters and watershed properties merz and blöschl 2004 oudin et al 2008 song et al 2019 yokoo et al 2001 however this relationship is often complex and highly non linear and hence many studies have implemented non linear and machine learning based algorithms such as artificial neural networks ann random forests rf support vector machines svm etc to deduce the relationship baez villanueva et al 2021 golian et al 2021 heuvelmans et al 2006 saadi et al 2019 song et al 2022 unlike regression based methods donor based methods attempts to find a suitable donor gauged watershed s that is most similar to the target ungauged watershed and transfer full set of parameters from the donor the transfer of full parameter set keeps the inter correlation structure between the model parameters intact which is found to be a prominent reason behind higher efficacy of donor based methods than regression based methods wherein prediction of individual parameters disregard such correlation structure arsenault and brissette 2014 he et al 2011 oudin et al 2008 the selection of potential donor watershed is based on hydrologic similarity between the gauged and ungauged watersheds however inferring similarity between watersheds is not a straight forward task and has received wide attention throughout the world brunner et al 2020 toth 2013 wagener et al 2007 two approaches of selecting potential donor watershed are spatial proximity sp and physical similarity ps the sp method assumes nearby watersheds to be hydrologically homogeneous and hence transfers parameters from nearest watersheds to the ungauged watershed arsenault et al 2019 li et al 2014 swain and patra 2017 however efficiency of this method is known to be affected by density of gauging stations lebecherel et al 2016 neri et al 2020 yang et al 2018 in the physical similarity method watersheds with similar physiographic and hydro climatic properties are assumed to have similar hydrologic functioning while the physical similarity method is found to have greater success in many regions arsenault and brissette 2014 baez villanueva et al 2021 oudin et al 2008 it is also found to be dependent upon the selection and incorporation of appropriate watershed properties oudin et al 2010 pool et al 2021 in addition use of multiple donors instead of single donors have been found to increase the efficiency of donor based methods by averaging out the errors obtained from different donors arsenault et al 2015 mcintyre et al 2005 qi et al 2021 current methods of prediction in ungauged watersheds operational in nepal are incapable of yielding accurate predictions mainly because they are empirical relationships derived with only a few gauges and without incorporating the hydrological components such as land cover and soil characteristics panthi et al 2021 hydrologic processes in watersheds of nepal are highly heterogeneous hannah et al 2005 shin et al 2021 rendering prediction in ungauged watersheds a challenging yet vital task in these watersheds most of the research conducted in the pub domain are model independent or statistical methods that are used to predict specific flow signatures rather than the full hydrograph and are yet to be applied in a sufficiently large sample to obtain generalizable results chalise et al 2003 müller and thompson 2016 panthi et al 2021 rees et al 2004 only a handful of studies involving model dependent regionalization methods have been employed with their limitations and research gap bastola et al 2008 marahatta et al 2021 nepal et al 2017b shrestha et al 2007 for example shrestha et al 2007 assessed the transferability of a physically based distributed model based btopmc blockwise use of topmodel with muskingum cunge routing in eight watersheds located in different physiographic zones of nepal their results showed that the model parameters could be transferred with reproducibility in runoff volume base flows as well as annual variations likewise marahatta et al 2021 set up a swat model in glacierized budhigandaki watershed of nepal and tested the potential of calibrated model parameters in simulating the flows in immediate upstream and downstream locations with satisfactory results these studies however include a single or small number of watersheds and test only one regionalization method without comparing the performance with other methods in another study by nepal et al 2017b the transferrability of model parameters in two glacierized watersheds of eastern nepal were assessed using a distributed process based model j2000 the results showed that transferring model parameters from similar watershed showed good performance in the tamor river watershed even though the model was run in different periods for the target and donor watersheds however the selection of donor watershed was purely based on expert judgement making the methodology of watershed selection inapplicable in other watersheds this study therefore attempts to fill this research gap by assessing performances of four different regionalization methods principal component regression pcr random forests rf physical similarity ps and spatial proximity sp in a relatively large sample of 23 watersheds located throughout nepal the gr4j modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier rainfall runoff model perrin et al 2003 was used in this study due to its simple structure parsimonious nature and wide use in regionalization studies arsenault et al 2019 lebecherel et al 2016 oudin et al 2008 yang et al 2020 the model has also been tested in few watersheds of nepal with varying performance bharati et al 2019 nepal et al 2017a b pokhrel et al 2014 for representing the snow processes the cemaneige snow module valéry 2010 was coupled to the gr4j model referred to as gr4j cn hereafter the study aims to answer the following research questions i how does gr4j cn model perform in watersheds of nepal ii how does widely used regionalization methods perform for simulating daily hydrograph and flow duration curve in ungauged watersheds of nepal and iii does using multiple donors improve efficiency of donor based methods 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study region includes 23 watersheds covering a wide range of geographical regions across nepal fig 1 nepal lies in the central part of the himalayan region extending 885 km east west and 145 248 km south north the country has a sharp contrast in elevation and slope between the southern lowland plains and northern mountain peaks the elevation of the country ranges from 50 m to 8848 m within a short latitude band resulting in large climatic variations throughout the country all five principal groups of world climates recognized by köppen geiger classification system can be observed in nepal with temperate climate with dry winter and hot summer being the dominating type karki et al 2016 precipitation in nepal is highly governed by the indian summer monsoon with its duration and intensity decreasing from east to west and north western disturbances bringing rain to the north western mountains during the winter karki et al 2017 the post monsoon season in nepal generally starts the receding limb of the hydrograph that goes uninterrupted majority of times even during heavy rainfall rees et al 2004 the main criterion for selection of watersheds was the availability of hydro meteorological data it was ensured that the hydro meteorological data spanned the same period to negate the effects of non stationary climate on regionalization performance watersheds with good quality data from years 2000 2015 were chosen however few watersheds with 2 3 years of fewer data were also retained to have more informative content the watersheds are small to medium sized with drainage area spanning from 147 km2 to around 7000 km2 the study watersheds also consist of 12 nested watersheds a sub watershed within a larger watershed with single level of nestedness i e having only one upstream or downstream gauging station the sub watersheds overlap around 17 68 of the total area in the nested watersheds the average annual precipitation of the watersheds ranges from a 1000 mm to around 3600 mm with a median amount of 1700 mm 70 85 of total annual rainfall in the watersheds is contributed by the yearly monsoonal rainfall average daily temperature in the selected watersheds ranges from 2 04 c to 20 62 c with a median temperature of 11 64 c similarly the median minimum and maximum temperature ranges from 0 83 to 21 68 c in terms of land use majority of the watersheds are forested with an average areal coverage of 51 80 likewise grasslands and croplands account for 16 and 15 of the total watershed area on average 2 2 data description the input data required for the model are daily precipitation daily potential evapotranspiration daily average air temperature and daily discharge for model calibration and validation data from ground stations maintained by department of hydrology and meteorology nepal dhm were retrieved for precipitation temperature and discharge watershed average precipitation was computed using thiessen s polygon method schumann 1998 similarly potential evapotranspiration was calculated using oudin s formula oudin et al 2005 apart from input data for rainfall runoff model a database containing various physio climatic properties of the watersheds was developed for use in regression based as well as ps method table 1 the properties that could be potential factors for controlling the streamflow generation processes and hence act as an indicator of the hydrologic regime in the watersheds were selected the properties selection was primarily based on literature review whereas some of the properties were added due to its greater significance in the study area the topographical attributes used in the study are catchment area km2 average elevation m and average slope derived from digital elevation model dem by shuttle radar topographic mission srtm with a resolution of 30 m similarly long term annual mean of watershed averaged precipitation mm monsoon contribution computed as the percentage of monsoon precipitation to average annual precipitation and aridity index atlas 1992 were used as climatic descriptors under geologic and geo morphologic variables the fraction of area covered by each geologic classes were estimated from simplified geologic map of nepal prepared by department of mines and geology nepal dmg average depth to bedrock values were extracted from soilgrids v2 0 global dataset hengl et al 2017 and were watershed averaged drainage density was obtained as the ratio of total length of streams in the watershed to the total area the topographic wetness index twi which is usually used as a proxy for soil moisture storage in the catchment beven and kirkby 1979 was computed as the logarithmic ratio of upslope area and local slope the fraction of area covered by various landcover classes were extracted from the landcover of hindu kush himalaya hkh dataset uddin et al 2015 prepared by international centre for integrated mountain development icimod we also extracted three remote sensing based vegetative indices the normalized differene vegetation index ndvi didan 2015 normalized difference snow index ndsi hall et al 2016 and leaf area index lai myneni et al 2015 from temporal and spatial averaging of modis v6 0 products finally we extracted fraction of sand silt and clay in each watershed from the soil map produced by international maize and wheat improvement centre cimmyt in collaboration with soil science research centre nssrc under nepal agricultural research council narc 3 methodology 3 1 hydrological model the gr4j is a lumped conceptual model with four free parameters and two stores for production and routing phases the model in its basic form lacks the snow processes which is dominant in most of the watersheds selected in this study hence the cemaneige snow module valéry 2010 a 2 parameter snow accumulation and melt model based on degree day approach was linked with the gr4j model the coupled gr4j cemaneige gr4j cn model was implemented in r software environment using the airgr package coron et al 2022 2017 table 2 shows the parameters of gr4j cn model and their search ranges the total watershed area was discretized into five elevation bands of equal area using the hypsometric curve extracted from the dem the input temperature data were extrapolated for each band using a constant lapse rate of 5 2 ckm 1 following kattel et al 2013 the parameter values were kept same for all elevation bands and the runoff from each band were separately summed up to get the total runoff at the outlet meaning no inter routing between the elevation bands was adopted 3 1 1 model calibration and validation the model was run in daily time scale from 2000 to 2015 16 years for most of the watersheds with exception in some watersheds that had 2 3 years of less data as discussed earlier a split sample approach was adopted with the first 70 as calibration period and remaining 30 as validation period the first year of the run period was used for model warm up to ensure adequate storage states were achieved the widely used nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 metric was used as objective function and the optimization problem was formulated as the minimization of 1 nse value nse value can range between and 1 where a value of 1 corresponds to a perfect match between modeled and observed data 0 indicates that the model predictions are as accurate as the mean of the observed data and negative nse values indicate that mean of observed data is a better predictor than the model due to utilization of squared errors in its formulation the nse metric has been known to be more biased towards high flow than the low flows despite its drawbacks nse metric was adopted in this study to make the results comparable with similar regionalization studies there was a possibility of using different objective functions to target specific flow signatures however studying the effects of objective functions in regionalization process was beyond the scope of this study apart from the nse metric the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 was also computed since it is a metric that represents the overall trade offs between different flow quantiles similarly volumetric efficiency ve criss and winston 2008 was used to assess the efficiency of the model for reproducing the volumetric water balance the calibration process employed automatic optimization using the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua optimization algorithm duan et al 1993 1992 implemented in the sceua function of the rtop r package skøien et al 2014 the lower and upper bounds of the parameters are required to limit the search space for model parameters which were chosen as shown in table 2 the initial values were set as the mid value of parameter range and all other arguments of the sceua function were set to the default values although different studies show that the effect of equifinality wherein different set of parameters yield similar model performance beven 2006 doesn t affect the regionalization results arsenault and brissette 2014 qi et al 2022 we repeated the model calibration ten times for each watershed this produced 10 different optimal parameter sets for each watershed with a total of 230 parameter sets for all the watersheds included in the study for each watershed the parameter set that resulted in highest nse score was then retained as final optimal parameter set to be used in regionalization 3 2 regionalization methods after obtaining calibrated parameters for all the watersheds using on site calibration os four different regionalization methods were compared in this study i principle component regression pcr and ii random forests rf belonging to regression based methods and iii spatial proximity sp and iv physical similarity ps under donor based methods since validation of regionalization results is not possible in real world ungauged watersheds a pseudo ungauged watershed approach was used where a gauged watershed was treated as ungauged by disregarding the observed discharge data in the modelling process all the regionalization methods were applied in a leave one out cross validation framework where out of 23 gauged watersheds one was assumed to be pseudo ungauged and its parameters were derived using different regionalization methods the results of the regionalization methods were compared with the results obtained from on site calibration and their performance was noted during both calibration and validation periods to obtain the regionalization performance in all watersheds this process was repeated by assuming each watershed to be pseudo ungauged in turn it is also worth mentioning that the performance of regionalization methods in calibration and validation periods doesn t necessary imply the same as for the gauged watersheds while in the gauged case validation period is used to test the temporal transferability of model parameters the calibration and validation periods in ungauged case have different meaning the results in calibration period refer to spatial transferability of model parameters since the calibration period is similar for gauged watersheds as well however the results in validation period are much more exacting since it denotes transferability in both spatial as well as temporal domain 3 2 1 principle component regression pcr the pcr is a regression analysis technique that is based on principal component analysis pca a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms correlated variables into non correlated principal components using linear combination it has been widely used as a pre processor for removing multicollinearity and redundancy problems in regression analysis instead of using raw physio climatic data as predictors the method utilizes the principal components obtained from the raw data and employs a standard multivariate linear regression based on squared residuals to predict each individual model parameters this method assumes that the physio climatic covariates are good predictors of model parameters and can be linearly related to the model parameter values the principal component regression was employed using the pls r package mevik and wehrens 2007 3 2 2 random forests rf the relationship between model parameters and watershed properties are often complex and highly non linear to account for this we implemented the random forest rf machine learning algorithm breiman 2001 it follows the concept of ensemble of random decision trees and can deal with both supervised classification as well as regression tasks a decision tree selects random independent variables and uses them to establish a relationship with the dependent variables the relationship is then validated in other samples and its efficiency is noted by aggregating the results of multiple decision trees the random forest can provide acccurate predictions with the ability to even deal with high dimensional data and small sample sizes biau and scornet 2016 the randomforest package liaw et al 2002 was used in this study to employ the rf algorithm the number of trees to grow was set to default value of 500 whereas the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split was set to p 3 where p is number of variables 3 2 3 spatial proximity sp in sp method potential donor watersheds are chosen based on its geographic distance from the ungauged watershed the method assumes that nearby watersheds are homogeneous in their hydrologic functioning and hence have shareable parameters oudin et al 2008 the euclidian distance dis t t d eq 1 was used in order to find the distance between ungauged watershed and nearby potential donors as 1 dis t t d x t x d 2 y t y d 2 where x and y represents the longitude and latitude of the centroid of watersheds in universal traverse mercator utm system whereas the subscripts t and d denotes target and donor watersheds respectively 3 2 4 physical similarity ps the ps method searches for the most similar watersheds to the target ungauged watershed by exploring the closeness in terms of watershed properties section 2 2 to assign equal weight to each watersheds characteristic we used a minmax scaling eq 2 to transform all the values within the range of 0 and 1 baez villanueva et al 2021 2 z f x f x min x max x min where z f is the normalized value x f is the value of the characteristic for watersheds f while x max and x min are the maximum and minimum values of the characteristic x over all watersheds to infer similarity among the watersheds we used a similarity index burn and boorman 1993 eq 3 which measures distance in the watershed properties space using absolute values given as 3 s t d m 1 n z t m z d m where s t d is the similarity index z t m and z d m are the normalized values of m th property of target ungauged and donor gauged watersheds respectively 3 2 5 multiple donors approach for the donor based methods a further experiment using multiple donors instead of single donor was conducted two different options for inferring parameters from multiple donors are parameter averaging and output averaging in parameter averaging individual parameters from multiple donors are averaged and fed into the model set up in ungauged watershed however this method is known to have lower performance primarily due to the same reason as for regression based methods wherein parameter inter correlation and structure is not accounted for the output averaging option resolves this issue by transferring full parameter set in turn from each donors producing an ensemble of model outputs which are then averaged to get the final hydrograph at ungauged watershed for averaging the inverse distance weighing idw method was adopted that assigns different weights to the donors based on degree of similarity or proximity the weightings are computed as w i d 1 d t d i 1 n 1 d t d where w i d is the weight for ith donor basin d t d is the distance between ungauged target and donor watershed in either the coordinate space for sp eq 1 or watershed properties space for ps eq 3 4 results 4 1 on site calibration performance the gr4j cn model was calibrated in 23 different watersheds across nepal using the sce ua automatic optimization algorithm and nse kge and ve metrics as goodness of fit measures fig 2 shows the summary and spatial distribution of performance metrics for gr4j cn model during on site calibration the model showed good performance in majority of the watersheds with a median nse value of 0 76 and 0 74 for calibration and validation period respectively average change in nse from calibration to validation was around 0 058 60 of the studied watersheds exceeded the value of 0 7 during calibration and 0 68 during validation similarly the model was able to achieve a median kge and ve score of 0 83 and 0 70 during the calibration period but the performance declined during the validation period reaching 0 73 and 0 66 respectively the model performance for all the watersheds declined from calibration to validation except in five watersheds where the calibrated model was a better fit in the validation period 4 2 regionalization performance fig 3 shows the comparative performances of on site calibration and four regionalization methods during calibration and validation periods the ps method outperformed other methods with a median nse of 0 66 during calibration and 0 67 during validation periods the method was able to exceed 85 of the median performance of a calibrated model other methods had comparable performances with median nse around 0 6 however donor based methods were found to be more robust than the regression based methods in the study area the rf method performed worst during the calibration period with median nse of 0 56 whereas pcr had the lowest median nse of 0 59 during validation period fig 4 shows the performance of calibrated and regionalized models for individual watersheds surprisingly for some watersheds such as watershed 120 and 438 all the regionalization methods were able to achieve good performance the performance of regionalization methods was generally worst in poorly calibrated watersheds it is not possible to outperform an optimized model during the calibration period since it is the most optimum result that could be achieved exceeding the optimized model s performance by other regionalization methods would imply that the optimization process was incomplete and non optimal parameters were found however in the validation period it is possible that the transferred parameters perform better than the calibrated parameters it was observed that while none of the regionalization methods could exceed the nse value achieved during on site calibration some of the regionalized parameters outperformed even the calibrated model during the validation period the parameters regionalized using ps method was able to outperform calibrated model parameters in 6 of the 23 watersheds during the validation period other methods had better performance than on site calibration in 3 different watersheds one exception to the better performance of ps method was in watershed 439 35 where sp method showed good results a separate ad hoc analysis of the watershed needs to be carried out for figuring out the proper reasoning behind this however a probable cause could be due to inadequacy of catchment properties that were selected for the study it is possible that the dominant controls of streamflow generation could be missing or complex limiting the applicability of ps method in the nested watersheds both the donor based methods identified the nested counterparts as the most suitable donor this is to be expected as they have overlapping areas and to some extent share similar physio climatic properties however in two of the upstream sub watersheds 680 and 286 the ps method found a donor other than their nested counterpart in these watersheds transferring the parameters from their corresponding nested watersheds as suggested by sp resulted in very poor performance while the ps method showed good results as shown in fig 4 overall the donor based methods were found to be more favorable than regression based methods for daily hydrograph simulation with the ps method being the most robust one furthermore ability of the regionalization methods to reproduce the flow duration curve fdc were also assessed using error duration curves edc the edc müller et al 2014 müller and thompson 2016 is computed as the ratio of predicted flow to observed flow at each exceedace probability and aids in visually identifying the prediction errors at different flow quantiles fig 5 shows the error in flow duration curves obtained from flow simulated using on site calibration as well as regionalization of model parameters a very interesting insight that the figure provides is for the results of on site calibration panel a during the on site calibration the model seems to have prioritized the high flows 50 exceedance while the low flows have been over predicted a behavior typical of the nse objective function that was chosen during the model calibration as in daily hydrograph ps outperformed other methods in capturing the flow duration curves although having poor predictability for extreme flows panel b the regression based methods rf and pcr were found to have under predicted all the flow quantiles in majority of the watersheds panel d and e 4 3 multiple donors approach for each pseudo ungauged watershed an increasing number of donor watersheds were used to predict daily hydrograph by averaging either ensemble of outputs or the individual parameter values fig 6 shows how including multiple donor watersheds effect the efficiency of donor based methods the output averaging method was found to be a better alternative than the parameter averaging option for improving performance of both the sp and ps methods using the parameter averaging option resulted in only a slight increase in the nse value with performance dropping as more donors were added for both the donor based methods the output averaging option was able to improve the performance of ps method with an increase in overall median nse from 0 63 using single donor to 0 69 there was an increase in performance up to 5 donor watersheds after which performance dropped slightly ultimately reaching a plateau as the number of donor watersheds were increased the sp method also showed gradual performance improvement with added donor watersheds and was able to reach a nse value of 0 67 when almost all the donor watersheds were used from 0 59 using single donor 5 discussion 5 1 hydrologic model performance the gr4j cn model performed well in simulating the runoff in majority of nepalese watersheds although no regional patterns of model performance were observed small sized watersheds generally exhibited poor performance one of the probable reasons for this could be the inadequacy of conceptual lumped structure of the model to represent the local scale processes occurring in these small watersheds the modeling results may also have been affected by the availability and quality of input data such as precipitation which was obtained from ground stations majority of which are situated in lowlands leading to uncertain estimates in headwater watersheds another caveat of the modeling results is the exclusion of glacier processes which might be significant in some of the study watersheds although nepal et al 2017a showed that including a glacier module improves the model performance of the gr4j model in one of the study watersheds the effect of adding this complexity in the regionalization performance could be a subject to scrutiny in future studies 5 2 regionalization performance the donor based methods were found to outperform regression based methods in majority of the watersheds out of four regionalization methods the ps method was found to be the most robust method for prediction of both the daily hydrograph and flow duration curve in ungauged watersheds of nepal this result is inline with other studies arsenault and brissette 2014 baez villanueva et al 2021 oudin et al 2008 where methods based on physical similarity approach outperform other methods the primary reason for this could be attributed to the fact that the donor based methods retain the inter relationship between the model parameters which is neglected in the regression based methods hannah et al 2005 showed that delineation of hydrologically homogeneous regions in the geographic space is difficult in nepalese watersheds which could also be linked to the poorer performance of sp method in this study there are however some outlier watersheds where the general results do not follow in two of the watersheds the sp method outperforms the ps method which could be an indication of complex processes occurring in these watersheds which are not adequately represented by the watershed attributes used in this study oudin et al 2010 similarly in nested watersheds both the sp and ps methods identify the corresponding nested watershed to be the most suitable donor in two of the watersheds however transferring model parameter sets from downstream nested watershed as suggested by sp resulted in very poor performance while donors identified by ps showed reasonable predictions this result could be taken as an indicator of the complex and heterogeneous runoff processes occurring within these watershed shin et al 2021 likewise using error duration curves edc it was observed that the ps method also led to better representation of flow duration curve than other methods additionally transferring parameters from multiple donors using output averaging option was found to increase the efficiency of donor based methods while parameter averaging option degraded the regionalization performance this result is consistent with other studies neri et al 2020 oudin et al 2008 yang et al 2020 2018 and further emphasizes the importance of transferring complete parameter sets instead of individual parameters the ps method was still the best method when using multiple donors with 3 5 donor basins as an optimal number inclusion of larger watershed sample however might alter the results of regionalization methods for example methods like sp that rely on the gauging density of the area and regression based methods such as rf that are data hungry might output improved results with the increase in gauged watersheds the regionalization efficiency is also dependent upon the performance of hydrologic model and hence comes with its inherent uncertainties in the modeling chain a threshold cut off ranging from 0 5 to 0 7 nse are usually recommended in regionalization studies oudin et al 2008 arsenault et al 2019 in order to exclude poorly calibrated watersheds however we opted to use all the watersheds given the limited sample size of study watersheds qi et al 2021 further studies could investigate the effects of varying model complexity yang et al 2020 and assess uncertainties arising from different sources of input data such as ground stations and satellite estimates baez villanueva et al 2021 in addition other potential extensions to this study could be to assess the effect of using different calibration options arsenault et al 2019 objective functions for model calibration to target specific flow quantiles golian et al 2021 and investigating the effects of parameter sensitivities on regionalization performance pool et al 2021 5 3 potentials of donor based methods the search for best donor watershed in order to assess whether the donors that were selected according to ps or sp method were the best donor i e donor yielding highest nse out of all the others in the study area we conducted an experiment where the parameters of all the gauged watersheds were in turn transferred to the pseudo ungauged watershed fig 7 shows the results of the experiment for many watersheds the best donor was different to that identified by the ps or sp method the figure also shows the regionalization methods outperforming calibrated model during the validation period in some watersheds with the best donor every watershed had the potential to reach at least 81 of calibrated model s efficiency during the calibration period and 70 in the validation period the median nse with the best donor was 0 72 and 0 77 for calibration and validation periods respectively these results imply a need for research on defining and understanding hydrologic similarities using a large sample watersheds a domain that haven t gained much attention after the early 2000s hannah et al 2005 kansakar et al 2002 in the study area 6 conclusions this study focused on the assessment of widely used model dependent regionalization methods for hydrologic simulation in ungauged watersheds of nepal firstly a gr4j rainfall runoff model coupled with cemaneige snow module gr4j cn was employed in 23 small to medium sized watersheds across nepal next physical and climatic properties were extracted from multiple local and global datasets for all the watersheds using these watershed properties and calibrated model parameters four different regionalization methods i principal component regression pcr ii random forests rf iii spatial proximity sp and iv physical similarity ps were tested for their performance in simulating daily hydrograph and flow duration curves the performance of regionalization methods for simulation of daily hydrograph and flow duration curve were tested for all the watersheds turn wise in what is called a leave one out cross validation technique the gr4j cn model was able to perform well in simulating daily flows in majority of the study watersheds with a median nse of 0 76 and 0 74 for calibration and validation periods respectively while the other methods showed comparable performance the ps method was found to be most favorable and robust for the study area exceeding 85 of the median nse value obtained with calibrated model a further analysis by including multiple donor watersheds was found to improve the performance of donor based methods when output averaging option was used instead of parameter averaging option to conclude the model dependent regionalization methods show promising results for hydrologic simulation in ungauged himalayan watersheds of nepal this study aims to provide a new

7628,study region the study region is 23 different watersheds across nepal study focus this study aims at assessing the strengths and weaknesses of widely used regionalization methods for simulating daily hydrograph and flow duration curve in a comparatively large sample of 23 medium to small sized watersheds across nepal we employed a deductive approach based on extractable watershed properties to test the performance of four regionalization methods principal component regression pcr random forests rf under regression based methods spatial proximity sp and physical similarity ps under donor based methods in a leave one out cross validation loocv setting new hydrological insights for the region the gr4j rainfall runoff model coupled with cemaneige snow module gr4j cn could provide good simulation for majority of the watersheds with median nse of 0 76 and 0 74 for calibration and validation periods respectively model simulation using parameter values predicted from different regionalization methods showed satisfactory results in majority of the watersheds for daily hydrograph simulation while there wasn t a single method that performed well in all of the watersheds the physical similarity methods was found to be the most robust visual comparison of errors in flow duration curve fdc also indicated physical similarity method as a better approach in ungauged watersheds of nepal further experiment using multiple donors using the output averaging option was found to increase the performance of donor based methods while the parameter averaging option resulted in a drop in performance the study provides a comprehensive assessment of regionalization methods and advocates the use of hydrological model regionalization as a promising tool for streamflow prediction in ungauged himalayan watersheds graphical abstract ga1 keywords cemaneige gr4j nepal regionalization ungauged 1 introduction continuous discharge time series provides indispensable information for a plethora of water engineering tasks such as water infrastructure development hydro energy production forecasting floods and droughts and designing protection measures water allocation watershed management and many more razavi and coulibaly 2013 however streamflow data is not readily available in every section of the river especially in the himalayan region hostile climate and complex topography makes it difficult to setup and maintain gauging stations leaving majority of the watersheds ungauged nepal et al 2017b panthi et al 2021 by definition an ungauged watershed is an area with nonexistent or poor quality of streamflow records sivapalan et al 2003 this definition can also be extended to watersheds undergoing significant changes since historical data might not reflect the hydrologic processes occurring within the watershed anymore he et al 2011 owing to the key problem of hydrological prediction in ungauged watersheds the international association of hydrological sciences iahs declared the period 2003 2012 as the decade for predictions in ungauged watersheds pub to streamline the research efforts worldwide for developing effective solutions to this issue sivapalan et al 2003 although prediction in ungauged watersheds was already a key topic of research in the past burn and boorman 1993 dalrymple 1960 the pub initiative led a massive surge in this research domain with contributions from all over the world blöschl et al 2013 guo et al 2021 he et al 2011 parajka et al 2013 razavi and coulibaly 2013 a wide range of hydrologic signatures such as mean annual flow peak flows low flows flow duration curves and baseflow index among others can be used to describe the hydrologic regime of a watershed nevertheless the full discharge hydrograph as the integrated measure of complex processes occurring in a catchment is the signature that contains the most information regarding the hydrologic functioning beven 2011 in an ungauged watershed depending upon the application it might be desirable to predict either the hydrologic signatures only or the full discharge hydrograph the former being easily extractable from the latter parajka et al 2013 a common strategy to predict hydrologic signatures in an ungauged watershed is to utilize the regional information available from gauged watersheds and transfer it to the ungauged watersheds in a process referred to as regionalization burn and boorman 1993 dalrymple 1960 for predicting most of the hydrologic signatures model independent regionalization methods are adopted that transfers the particular signature either from hydrologically similar watersheds or by establishing a relationship with the catchment s physical and hydro climatic attributes however when continuous hydrograph is required in ungauged watersheds model dependent regionalization is often considered in which parameters of a hydrologic model calibrated in gauged watersheds are transferred to model set up in the ungauged watershed blöschl et al 2013 razavi and coulibaly 2013 the regionalization methods can be broadly categorized into two groups regression based and donor based methods he et al 2011 the regression based method attempts to find a relationship between watershed properties and calibrated model parameters one of the widely used regression based methods is multivariate linear regression mlr wherein a linear regression model is assumed to sufficiently describe the relationship between model parameters and watershed properties merz and blöschl 2004 oudin et al 2008 song et al 2019 yokoo et al 2001 however this relationship is often complex and highly non linear and hence many studies have implemented non linear and machine learning based algorithms such as artificial neural networks ann random forests rf support vector machines svm etc to deduce the relationship baez villanueva et al 2021 golian et al 2021 heuvelmans et al 2006 saadi et al 2019 song et al 2022 unlike regression based methods donor based methods attempts to find a suitable donor gauged watershed s that is most similar to the target ungauged watershed and transfer full set of parameters from the donor the transfer of full parameter set keeps the inter correlation structure between the model parameters intact which is found to be a prominent reason behind higher efficacy of donor based methods than regression based methods wherein prediction of individual parameters disregard such correlation structure arsenault and brissette 2014 he et al 2011 oudin et al 2008 the selection of potential donor watershed is based on hydrologic similarity between the gauged and ungauged watersheds however inferring similarity between watersheds is not a straight forward task and has received wide attention throughout the world brunner et al 2020 toth 2013 wagener et al 2007 two approaches of selecting potential donor watershed are spatial proximity sp and physical similarity ps the sp method assumes nearby watersheds to be hydrologically homogeneous and hence transfers parameters from nearest watersheds to the ungauged watershed arsenault et al 2019 li et al 2014 swain and patra 2017 however efficiency of this method is known to be affected by density of gauging stations lebecherel et al 2016 neri et al 2020 yang et al 2018 in the physical similarity method watersheds with similar physiographic and hydro climatic properties are assumed to have similar hydrologic functioning while the physical similarity method is found to have greater success in many regions arsenault and brissette 2014 baez villanueva et al 2021 oudin et al 2008 it is also found to be dependent upon the selection and incorporation of appropriate watershed properties oudin et al 2010 pool et al 2021 in addition use of multiple donors instead of single donors have been found to increase the efficiency of donor based methods by averaging out the errors obtained from different donors arsenault et al 2015 mcintyre et al 2005 qi et al 2021 current methods of prediction in ungauged watersheds operational in nepal are incapable of yielding accurate predictions mainly because they are empirical relationships derived with only a few gauges and without incorporating the hydrological components such as land cover and soil characteristics panthi et al 2021 hydrologic processes in watersheds of nepal are highly heterogeneous hannah et al 2005 shin et al 2021 rendering prediction in ungauged watersheds a challenging yet vital task in these watersheds most of the research conducted in the pub domain are model independent or statistical methods that are used to predict specific flow signatures rather than the full hydrograph and are yet to be applied in a sufficiently large sample to obtain generalizable results chalise et al 2003 müller and thompson 2016 panthi et al 2021 rees et al 2004 only a handful of studies involving model dependent regionalization methods have been employed with their limitations and research gap bastola et al 2008 marahatta et al 2021 nepal et al 2017b shrestha et al 2007 for example shrestha et al 2007 assessed the transferability of a physically based distributed model based btopmc blockwise use of topmodel with muskingum cunge routing in eight watersheds located in different physiographic zones of nepal their results showed that the model parameters could be transferred with reproducibility in runoff volume base flows as well as annual variations likewise marahatta et al 2021 set up a swat model in glacierized budhigandaki watershed of nepal and tested the potential of calibrated model parameters in simulating the flows in immediate upstream and downstream locations with satisfactory results these studies however include a single or small number of watersheds and test only one regionalization method without comparing the performance with other methods in another study by nepal et al 2017b the transferrability of model parameters in two glacierized watersheds of eastern nepal were assessed using a distributed process based model j2000 the results showed that transferring model parameters from similar watershed showed good performance in the tamor river watershed even though the model was run in different periods for the target and donor watersheds however the selection of donor watershed was purely based on expert judgement making the methodology of watershed selection inapplicable in other watersheds this study therefore attempts to fill this research gap by assessing performances of four different regionalization methods principal component regression pcr random forests rf physical similarity ps and spatial proximity sp in a relatively large sample of 23 watersheds located throughout nepal the gr4j modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier rainfall runoff model perrin et al 2003 was used in this study due to its simple structure parsimonious nature and wide use in regionalization studies arsenault et al 2019 lebecherel et al 2016 oudin et al 2008 yang et al 2020 the model has also been tested in few watersheds of nepal with varying performance bharati et al 2019 nepal et al 2017a b pokhrel et al 2014 for representing the snow processes the cemaneige snow module valéry 2010 was coupled to the gr4j model referred to as gr4j cn hereafter the study aims to answer the following research questions i how does gr4j cn model perform in watersheds of nepal ii how does widely used regionalization methods perform for simulating daily hydrograph and flow duration curve in ungauged watersheds of nepal and iii does using multiple donors improve efficiency of donor based methods 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study region includes 23 watersheds covering a wide range of geographical regions across nepal fig 1 nepal lies in the central part of the himalayan region extending 885 km east west and 145 248 km south north the country has a sharp contrast in elevation and slope between the southern lowland plains and northern mountain peaks the elevation of the country ranges from 50 m to 8848 m within a short latitude band resulting in large climatic variations throughout the country all five principal groups of world climates recognized by köppen geiger classification system can be observed in nepal with temperate climate with dry winter and hot summer being the dominating type karki et al 2016 precipitation in nepal is highly governed by the indian summer monsoon with its duration and intensity decreasing from east to west and north western disturbances bringing rain to the north western mountains during the winter karki et al 2017 the post monsoon season in nepal generally starts the receding limb of the hydrograph that goes uninterrupted majority of times even during heavy rainfall rees et al 2004 the main criterion for selection of watersheds was the availability of hydro meteorological data it was ensured that the hydro meteorological data spanned the same period to negate the effects of non stationary climate on regionalization performance watersheds with good quality data from years 2000 2015 were chosen however few watersheds with 2 3 years of fewer data were also retained to have more informative content the watersheds are small to medium sized with drainage area spanning from 147 km2 to around 7000 km2 the study watersheds also consist of 12 nested watersheds a sub watershed within a larger watershed with single level of nestedness i e having only one upstream or downstream gauging station the sub watersheds overlap around 17 68 of the total area in the nested watersheds the average annual precipitation of the watersheds ranges from a 1000 mm to around 3600 mm with a median amount of 1700 mm 70 85 of total annual rainfall in the watersheds is contributed by the yearly monsoonal rainfall average daily temperature in the selected watersheds ranges from 2 04 c to 20 62 c with a median temperature of 11 64 c similarly the median minimum and maximum temperature ranges from 0 83 to 21 68 c in terms of land use majority of the watersheds are forested with an average areal coverage of 51 80 likewise grasslands and croplands account for 16 and 15 of the total watershed area on average 2 2 data description the input data required for the model are daily precipitation daily potential evapotranspiration daily average air temperature and daily discharge for model calibration and validation data from ground stations maintained by department of hydrology and meteorology nepal dhm were retrieved for precipitation temperature and discharge watershed average precipitation was computed using thiessen s polygon method schumann 1998 similarly potential evapotranspiration was calculated using oudin s formula oudin et al 2005 apart from input data for rainfall runoff model a database containing various physio climatic properties of the watersheds was developed for use in regression based as well as ps method table 1 the properties that could be potential factors for controlling the streamflow generation processes and hence act as an indicator of the hydrologic regime in the watersheds were selected the properties selection was primarily based on literature review whereas some of the properties were added due to its greater significance in the study area the topographical attributes used in the study are catchment area km2 average elevation m and average slope derived from digital elevation model dem by shuttle radar topographic mission srtm with a resolution of 30 m similarly long term annual mean of watershed averaged precipitation mm monsoon contribution computed as the percentage of monsoon precipitation to average annual precipitation and aridity index atlas 1992 were used as climatic descriptors under geologic and geo morphologic variables the fraction of area covered by each geologic classes were estimated from simplified geologic map of nepal prepared by department of mines and geology nepal dmg average depth to bedrock values were extracted from soilgrids v2 0 global dataset hengl et al 2017 and were watershed averaged drainage density was obtained as the ratio of total length of streams in the watershed to the total area the topographic wetness index twi which is usually used as a proxy for soil moisture storage in the catchment beven and kirkby 1979 was computed as the logarithmic ratio of upslope area and local slope the fraction of area covered by various landcover classes were extracted from the landcover of hindu kush himalaya hkh dataset uddin et al 2015 prepared by international centre for integrated mountain development icimod we also extracted three remote sensing based vegetative indices the normalized differene vegetation index ndvi didan 2015 normalized difference snow index ndsi hall et al 2016 and leaf area index lai myneni et al 2015 from temporal and spatial averaging of modis v6 0 products finally we extracted fraction of sand silt and clay in each watershed from the soil map produced by international maize and wheat improvement centre cimmyt in collaboration with soil science research centre nssrc under nepal agricultural research council narc 3 methodology 3 1 hydrological model the gr4j is a lumped conceptual model with four free parameters and two stores for production and routing phases the model in its basic form lacks the snow processes which is dominant in most of the watersheds selected in this study hence the cemaneige snow module valéry 2010 a 2 parameter snow accumulation and melt model based on degree day approach was linked with the gr4j model the coupled gr4j cemaneige gr4j cn model was implemented in r software environment using the airgr package coron et al 2022 2017 table 2 shows the parameters of gr4j cn model and their search ranges the total watershed area was discretized into five elevation bands of equal area using the hypsometric curve extracted from the dem the input temperature data were extrapolated for each band using a constant lapse rate of 5 2 ckm 1 following kattel et al 2013 the parameter values were kept same for all elevation bands and the runoff from each band were separately summed up to get the total runoff at the outlet meaning no inter routing between the elevation bands was adopted 3 1 1 model calibration and validation the model was run in daily time scale from 2000 to 2015 16 years for most of the watersheds with exception in some watersheds that had 2 3 years of less data as discussed earlier a split sample approach was adopted with the first 70 as calibration period and remaining 30 as validation period the first year of the run period was used for model warm up to ensure adequate storage states were achieved the widely used nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 metric was used as objective function and the optimization problem was formulated as the minimization of 1 nse value nse value can range between and 1 where a value of 1 corresponds to a perfect match between modeled and observed data 0 indicates that the model predictions are as accurate as the mean of the observed data and negative nse values indicate that mean of observed data is a better predictor than the model due to utilization of squared errors in its formulation the nse metric has been known to be more biased towards high flow than the low flows despite its drawbacks nse metric was adopted in this study to make the results comparable with similar regionalization studies there was a possibility of using different objective functions to target specific flow signatures however studying the effects of objective functions in regionalization process was beyond the scope of this study apart from the nse metric the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 was also computed since it is a metric that represents the overall trade offs between different flow quantiles similarly volumetric efficiency ve criss and winston 2008 was used to assess the efficiency of the model for reproducing the volumetric water balance the calibration process employed automatic optimization using the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua optimization algorithm duan et al 1993 1992 implemented in the sceua function of the rtop r package skøien et al 2014 the lower and upper bounds of the parameters are required to limit the search space for model parameters which were chosen as shown in table 2 the initial values were set as the mid value of parameter range and all other arguments of the sceua function were set to the default values although different studies show that the effect of equifinality wherein different set of parameters yield similar model performance beven 2006 doesn t affect the regionalization results arsenault and brissette 2014 qi et al 2022 we repeated the model calibration ten times for each watershed this produced 10 different optimal parameter sets for each watershed with a total of 230 parameter sets for all the watersheds included in the study for each watershed the parameter set that resulted in highest nse score was then retained as final optimal parameter set to be used in regionalization 3 2 regionalization methods after obtaining calibrated parameters for all the watersheds using on site calibration os four different regionalization methods were compared in this study i principle component regression pcr and ii random forests rf belonging to regression based methods and iii spatial proximity sp and iv physical similarity ps under donor based methods since validation of regionalization results is not possible in real world ungauged watersheds a pseudo ungauged watershed approach was used where a gauged watershed was treated as ungauged by disregarding the observed discharge data in the modelling process all the regionalization methods were applied in a leave one out cross validation framework where out of 23 gauged watersheds one was assumed to be pseudo ungauged and its parameters were derived using different regionalization methods the results of the regionalization methods were compared with the results obtained from on site calibration and their performance was noted during both calibration and validation periods to obtain the regionalization performance in all watersheds this process was repeated by assuming each watershed to be pseudo ungauged in turn it is also worth mentioning that the performance of regionalization methods in calibration and validation periods doesn t necessary imply the same as for the gauged watersheds while in the gauged case validation period is used to test the temporal transferability of model parameters the calibration and validation periods in ungauged case have different meaning the results in calibration period refer to spatial transferability of model parameters since the calibration period is similar for gauged watersheds as well however the results in validation period are much more exacting since it denotes transferability in both spatial as well as temporal domain 3 2 1 principle component regression pcr the pcr is a regression analysis technique that is based on principal component analysis pca a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms correlated variables into non correlated principal components using linear combination it has been widely used as a pre processor for removing multicollinearity and redundancy problems in regression analysis instead of using raw physio climatic data as predictors the method utilizes the principal components obtained from the raw data and employs a standard multivariate linear regression based on squared residuals to predict each individual model parameters this method assumes that the physio climatic covariates are good predictors of model parameters and can be linearly related to the model parameter values the principal component regression was employed using the pls r package mevik and wehrens 2007 3 2 2 random forests rf the relationship between model parameters and watershed properties are often complex and highly non linear to account for this we implemented the random forest rf machine learning algorithm breiman 2001 it follows the concept of ensemble of random decision trees and can deal with both supervised classification as well as regression tasks a decision tree selects random independent variables and uses them to establish a relationship with the dependent variables the relationship is then validated in other samples and its efficiency is noted by aggregating the results of multiple decision trees the random forest can provide acccurate predictions with the ability to even deal with high dimensional data and small sample sizes biau and scornet 2016 the randomforest package liaw et al 2002 was used in this study to employ the rf algorithm the number of trees to grow was set to default value of 500 whereas the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split was set to p 3 where p is number of variables 3 2 3 spatial proximity sp in sp method potential donor watersheds are chosen based on its geographic distance from the ungauged watershed the method assumes that nearby watersheds are homogeneous in their hydrologic functioning and hence have shareable parameters oudin et al 2008 the euclidian distance dis t t d eq 1 was used in order to find the distance between ungauged watershed and nearby potential donors as 1 dis t t d x t x d 2 y t y d 2 where x and y represents the longitude and latitude of the centroid of watersheds in universal traverse mercator utm system whereas the subscripts t and d denotes target and donor watersheds respectively 3 2 4 physical similarity ps the ps method searches for the most similar watersheds to the target ungauged watershed by exploring the closeness in terms of watershed properties section 2 2 to assign equal weight to each watersheds characteristic we used a minmax scaling eq 2 to transform all the values within the range of 0 and 1 baez villanueva et al 2021 2 z f x f x min x max x min where z f is the normalized value x f is the value of the characteristic for watersheds f while x max and x min are the maximum and minimum values of the characteristic x over all watersheds to infer similarity among the watersheds we used a similarity index burn and boorman 1993 eq 3 which measures distance in the watershed properties space using absolute values given as 3 s t d m 1 n z t m z d m where s t d is the similarity index z t m and z d m are the normalized values of m th property of target ungauged and donor gauged watersheds respectively 3 2 5 multiple donors approach for the donor based methods a further experiment using multiple donors instead of single donor was conducted two different options for inferring parameters from multiple donors are parameter averaging and output averaging in parameter averaging individual parameters from multiple donors are averaged and fed into the model set up in ungauged watershed however this method is known to have lower performance primarily due to the same reason as for regression based methods wherein parameter inter correlation and structure is not accounted for the output averaging option resolves this issue by transferring full parameter set in turn from each donors producing an ensemble of model outputs which are then averaged to get the final hydrograph at ungauged watershed for averaging the inverse distance weighing idw method was adopted that assigns different weights to the donors based on degree of similarity or proximity the weightings are computed as w i d 1 d t d i 1 n 1 d t d where w i d is the weight for ith donor basin d t d is the distance between ungauged target and donor watershed in either the coordinate space for sp eq 1 or watershed properties space for ps eq 3 4 results 4 1 on site calibration performance the gr4j cn model was calibrated in 23 different watersheds across nepal using the sce ua automatic optimization algorithm and nse kge and ve metrics as goodness of fit measures fig 2 shows the summary and spatial distribution of performance metrics for gr4j cn model during on site calibration the model showed good performance in majority of the watersheds with a median nse value of 0 76 and 0 74 for calibration and validation period respectively average change in nse from calibration to validation was around 0 058 60 of the studied watersheds exceeded the value of 0 7 during calibration and 0 68 during validation similarly the model was able to achieve a median kge and ve score of 0 83 and 0 70 during the calibration period but the performance declined during the validation period reaching 0 73 and 0 66 respectively the model performance for all the watersheds declined from calibration to validation except in five watersheds where the calibrated model was a better fit in the validation period 4 2 regionalization performance fig 3 shows the comparative performances of on site calibration and four regionalization methods during calibration and validation periods the ps method outperformed other methods with a median nse of 0 66 during calibration and 0 67 during validation periods the method was able to exceed 85 of the median performance of a calibrated model other methods had comparable performances with median nse around 0 6 however donor based methods were found to be more robust than the regression based methods in the study area the rf method performed worst during the calibration period with median nse of 0 56 whereas pcr had the lowest median nse of 0 59 during validation period fig 4 shows the performance of calibrated and regionalized models for individual watersheds surprisingly for some watersheds such as watershed 120 and 438 all the regionalization methods were able to achieve good performance the performance of regionalization methods was generally worst in poorly calibrated watersheds it is not possible to outperform an optimized model during the calibration period since it is the most optimum result that could be achieved exceeding the optimized model s performance by other regionalization methods would imply that the optimization process was incomplete and non optimal parameters were found however in the validation period it is possible that the transferred parameters perform better than the calibrated parameters it was observed that while none of the regionalization methods could exceed the nse value achieved during on site calibration some of the regionalized parameters outperformed even the calibrated model during the validation period the parameters regionalized using ps method was able to outperform calibrated model parameters in 6 of the 23 watersheds during the validation period other methods had better performance than on site calibration in 3 different watersheds one exception to the better performance of ps method was in watershed 439 35 where sp method showed good results a separate ad hoc analysis of the watershed needs to be carried out for figuring out the proper reasoning behind this however a probable cause could be due to inadequacy of catchment properties that were selected for the study it is possible that the dominant controls of streamflow generation could be missing or complex limiting the applicability of ps method in the nested watersheds both the donor based methods identified the nested counterparts as the most suitable donor this is to be expected as they have overlapping areas and to some extent share similar physio climatic properties however in two of the upstream sub watersheds 680 and 286 the ps method found a donor other than their nested counterpart in these watersheds transferring the parameters from their corresponding nested watersheds as suggested by sp resulted in very poor performance while the ps method showed good results as shown in fig 4 overall the donor based methods were found to be more favorable than regression based methods for daily hydrograph simulation with the ps method being the most robust one furthermore ability of the regionalization methods to reproduce the flow duration curve fdc were also assessed using error duration curves edc the edc müller et al 2014 müller and thompson 2016 is computed as the ratio of predicted flow to observed flow at each exceedace probability and aids in visually identifying the prediction errors at different flow quantiles fig 5 shows the error in flow duration curves obtained from flow simulated using on site calibration as well as regionalization of model parameters a very interesting insight that the figure provides is for the results of on site calibration panel a during the on site calibration the model seems to have prioritized the high flows 50 exceedance while the low flows have been over predicted a behavior typical of the nse objective function that was chosen during the model calibration as in daily hydrograph ps outperformed other methods in capturing the flow duration curves although having poor predictability for extreme flows panel b the regression based methods rf and pcr were found to have under predicted all the flow quantiles in majority of the watersheds panel d and e 4 3 multiple donors approach for each pseudo ungauged watershed an increasing number of donor watersheds were used to predict daily hydrograph by averaging either ensemble of outputs or the individual parameter values fig 6 shows how including multiple donor watersheds effect the efficiency of donor based methods the output averaging method was found to be a better alternative than the parameter averaging option for improving performance of both the sp and ps methods using the parameter averaging option resulted in only a slight increase in the nse value with performance dropping as more donors were added for both the donor based methods the output averaging option was able to improve the performance of ps method with an increase in overall median nse from 0 63 using single donor to 0 69 there was an increase in performance up to 5 donor watersheds after which performance dropped slightly ultimately reaching a plateau as the number of donor watersheds were increased the sp method also showed gradual performance improvement with added donor watersheds and was able to reach a nse value of 0 67 when almost all the donor watersheds were used from 0 59 using single donor 5 discussion 5 1 hydrologic model performance the gr4j cn model performed well in simulating the runoff in majority of nepalese watersheds although no regional patterns of model performance were observed small sized watersheds generally exhibited poor performance one of the probable reasons for this could be the inadequacy of conceptual lumped structure of the model to represent the local scale processes occurring in these small watersheds the modeling results may also have been affected by the availability and quality of input data such as precipitation which was obtained from ground stations majority of which are situated in lowlands leading to uncertain estimates in headwater watersheds another caveat of the modeling results is the exclusion of glacier processes which might be significant in some of the study watersheds although nepal et al 2017a showed that including a glacier module improves the model performance of the gr4j model in one of the study watersheds the effect of adding this complexity in the regionalization performance could be a subject to scrutiny in future studies 5 2 regionalization performance the donor based methods were found to outperform regression based methods in majority of the watersheds out of four regionalization methods the ps method was found to be the most robust method for prediction of both the daily hydrograph and flow duration curve in ungauged watersheds of nepal this result is inline with other studies arsenault and brissette 2014 baez villanueva et al 2021 oudin et al 2008 where methods based on physical similarity approach outperform other methods the primary reason for this could be attributed to the fact that the donor based methods retain the inter relationship between the model parameters which is neglected in the regression based methods hannah et al 2005 showed that delineation of hydrologically homogeneous regions in the geographic space is difficult in nepalese watersheds which could also be linked to the poorer performance of sp method in this study there are however some outlier watersheds where the general results do not follow in two of the watersheds the sp method outperforms the ps method which could be an indication of complex processes occurring in these watersheds which are not adequately represented by the watershed attributes used in this study oudin et al 2010 similarly in nested watersheds both the sp and ps methods identify the corresponding nested watershed to be the most suitable donor in two of the watersheds however transferring model parameter sets from downstream nested watershed as suggested by sp resulted in very poor performance while donors identified by ps showed reasonable predictions this result could be taken as an indicator of the complex and heterogeneous runoff processes occurring within these watershed shin et al 2021 likewise using error duration curves edc it was observed that the ps method also led to better representation of flow duration curve than other methods additionally transferring parameters from multiple donors using output averaging option was found to increase the efficiency of donor based methods while parameter averaging option degraded the regionalization performance this result is consistent with other studies neri et al 2020 oudin et al 2008 yang et al 2020 2018 and further emphasizes the importance of transferring complete parameter sets instead of individual parameters the ps method was still the best method when using multiple donors with 3 5 donor basins as an optimal number inclusion of larger watershed sample however might alter the results of regionalization methods for example methods like sp that rely on the gauging density of the area and regression based methods such as rf that are data hungry might output improved results with the increase in gauged watersheds the regionalization efficiency is also dependent upon the performance of hydrologic model and hence comes with its inherent uncertainties in the modeling chain a threshold cut off ranging from 0 5 to 0 7 nse are usually recommended in regionalization studies oudin et al 2008 arsenault et al 2019 in order to exclude poorly calibrated watersheds however we opted to use all the watersheds given the limited sample size of study watersheds qi et al 2021 further studies could investigate the effects of varying model complexity yang et al 2020 and assess uncertainties arising from different sources of input data such as ground stations and satellite estimates baez villanueva et al 2021 in addition other potential extensions to this study could be to assess the effect of using different calibration options arsenault et al 2019 objective functions for model calibration to target specific flow quantiles golian et al 2021 and investigating the effects of parameter sensitivities on regionalization performance pool et al 2021 5 3 potentials of donor based methods the search for best donor watershed in order to assess whether the donors that were selected according to ps or sp method were the best donor i e donor yielding highest nse out of all the others in the study area we conducted an experiment where the parameters of all the gauged watersheds were in turn transferred to the pseudo ungauged watershed fig 7 shows the results of the experiment for many watersheds the best donor was different to that identified by the ps or sp method the figure also shows the regionalization methods outperforming calibrated model during the validation period in some watersheds with the best donor every watershed had the potential to reach at least 81 of calibrated model s efficiency during the calibration period and 70 in the validation period the median nse with the best donor was 0 72 and 0 77 for calibration and validation periods respectively these results imply a need for research on defining and understanding hydrologic similarities using a large sample watersheds a domain that haven t gained much attention after the early 2000s hannah et al 2005 kansakar et al 2002 in the study area 6 conclusions this study focused on the assessment of widely used model dependent regionalization methods for hydrologic simulation in ungauged watersheds of nepal firstly a gr4j rainfall runoff model coupled with cemaneige snow module gr4j cn was employed in 23 small to medium sized watersheds across nepal next physical and climatic properties were extracted from multiple local and global datasets for all the watersheds using these watershed properties and calibrated model parameters four different regionalization methods i principal component regression pcr ii random forests rf iii spatial proximity sp and iv physical similarity ps were tested for their performance in simulating daily hydrograph and flow duration curves the performance of regionalization methods for simulation of daily hydrograph and flow duration curve were tested for all the watersheds turn wise in what is called a leave one out cross validation technique the gr4j cn model was able to perform well in simulating daily flows in majority of the study watersheds with a median nse of 0 76 and 0 74 for calibration and validation periods respectively while the other methods showed comparable performance the ps method was found to be most favorable and robust for the study area exceeding 85 of the median nse value obtained with calibrated model a further analysis by including multiple donor watersheds was found to improve the performance of donor based methods when output averaging option was used instead of parameter averaging option to conclude the model dependent regionalization methods show promising results for hydrologic simulation in ungauged himalayan watersheds of nepal this study aims to provide a new

7629,study region this study was conducted in xiangjiaba reservoir located in the jinsha river china s upper reach of the yangtze river study focus large channel type reservoirs are characterized by significant runoff deep water and narrow and long channel shape creating unique hydrodynamic and thermodynamic conditions for their eco environmental systems however the hydro thermal processes of this type reservoir are not fully known a large channel type reservoir was selected to investigate the macroscopic processes through a field survey and employing a three dimensional 3d hydro thermodynamic model new hydrological insights for the region the reservoir experienced a seasonal varying thermal stratification with a vertical temperature difference of 9 c meanwhile a conjoint flow pattern was detected consisting of an upper layer warm water flow and a lower layer circulation which was very different from the lakes wind induced pattern when the reservoir was stratified the inflow warm water on the thermocline could produce a shear effect promoting vertical mixing and further contributing to hypolimnion shrinking the reservoir experienced a water age increase during the non stratification period with the near dam age being 20 days the trap effect of the lower layer circulation retained the cold water in the hypolimnion during the stratification period and the water age reached 115 days the presented varying flow pattern and transport timescale have essential effects on the eco environmental systems providing practical insights into managing water quality and aquatic environment in reservoirs graphical abstract ga1 keywords macroscopic flow patterns thermal stratification water age large channel type reservoir data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction reservoir plays an essential role in flood control water supply and power production when a reservoir is built in a river the thermodynamic conditions are commonly altered by increasing the water depth slowing the water flow and extending residence time li et al 2020a 2020b morovati et al 2022 thus vertical thermal stratification frequently occurs the stratified water columns are portrayed as a region of sharply varying temperatures metalimnion delineating an upper isothermal region epilimnion from a relatively static deeper region hypolimnion becker et al 2010 this vertical water column partition significantly affects the reservoir s entire aquatic ecology including water quality eutrophication nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics chen et al 2009 for example due to the stratification the surface bottom connectivity is suppressed giving rise to a nutrient rich but colder hypolimnion and a nutrient poor but warmer epilimnion read et al 2011 additionally the enhanced stratification can lead to increased phytoplankton aggregation in the epilimnion posing a significant threat to water quality paerl et al 2009 therefore it is paramount to understand the thermal structure evolutions for the comprehensive optimal management of reservoir water quality previous research on the thermal stratification and mixing process in natural waters has mainly focused on lakes or lake type reservoirs characterized by weak flows zhang et al 2014 2015 liu et al 2020 in subtropical or tropical monomictic lakes or reservoirs the stratification on a seasonal cycle of the water column results from the competition of the turbulent mixing events primarily driven by wind induced momentum noori et al 2019 and air water heat exchange saber et al 2018 the stratifying effects of surface heat input in summer and spring outweigh vertical mixing developing a stabilized regime of strong stratification this continues until autumn when the reservoirs commence losing heat to the atmosphere then the stratification is eroded under the combined impact of wind stress and heat loss inducing fall turnover events subsequently vertical mixing typically persists throughout the winter until the following early spring when surface heat input resumes recovers in recent decades dam constructions have caused significant changes in fluvial systems worldwide dudgeon 2000 pedroso et al 2014 with 63 of very long rivers in the world being influenced by reservoirs grill et al 2019 as a result the channel type reservoirs are formed based on the original river channel type reservoirs differ from lakes and lake type reservoirs in multiple ways mainly reflected in the geometric shapes and hydrodynamics li et al 2013 the channel type reservoirs retain the river channel shape i e the water depth and width are much smaller than the length given the larger inflows in such reservoirs the hydro thermodynamic process is more complex than the lake however most existing studies have focused on the correlation between the inflow elements e g discharge temperature and the stratification characteristics such as duration and strength becker et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 shi et al 2023 which are not adequate for understanding the influence of the inflow on the thermal regimes and flow patterns in the reservoir the inflow tends to affect the reservoir hydro thermodynamic process by producing a density flow regulating the reservoir thermal regimes the difference in inflow reservoir water density drives the density currents chung et al 2009 franca 2017 munoz et al 2020 mainly induced by the water temperature and sediment concentration difference usually the inflow with sediment is denser than the reservoir water which tends to produce an underflow chung et al 2009 in a stratified reservoir when the inflow water is less dense compared to the bottom water while denser than the surface water the interflow occurs in that case the vertical thermal structures are affected by the density currents in multiple aspects i e the thermal structure is not altered by the interflows but it is shifted from stratification to a mixed type by the underflows song et al 2009 ceng et al 2016 dam building could cause a significant decrease in suspended sediment concentration which has become the most crucial factor for sediment reduction sun et al 2021a and 2021b in a cascade reservoir system the incoming and reservoir sediment is significantly reduced by upstream dams and the effect of temperature induced density flow could become more critical chen et al 2015 chen et al 2016 shi et al 2022 until recently the research on the complex hydro thermodynamic process driven by the temperature induced density flow is more concentrated in the lake or sub reservoir lake type reservoir details are found in the researches conducted by woolway and simpson 2017 and simpson et al 2021 for the windermere lake in the uk and studies on sub reservoirs in the three gorges reservoir by yang et al 2015 and gao et al 2018 in these studies i e lakes and sub reservoirs the flow patterns are primarily driven by inhomogeneous water temperature distributions in spatial coates et al 1993 webster 2006 li et al 2020a 2020b however in a large channel type reservoir the water flows and the thermal structures are influenced by the combination of barotropic and baroclinic effects xie et al 2017 therefore the previous results from lakes or lake type reservoirs cannot be applied to the large channel type reservoirs and the hydro thermodynamics in such a sizeable channel type reservoir are not fully documented this research s primary objective is to investigate the macroscopic hydro thermodynamic processes in a sizeable channel type reservoir through a field survey and a 3d hydrodynamic model a detailed exploration of the reservoir on the water temperature velocity and water age as well as their spatial characteristics is carried out the interactions between hydro and thermo dynamic processes are analyzed and the seasonal variations are studied including the changing flow pattern thermocline decline and the bottom water age 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site located in the jinsha river as the upper reach of the yangtze river the xiangjiaba xjb reservoir categorized as a sizeable channel type reservoir was chosen as the study site in this study the jinsha river has abundant hydroelectric resources the hydroelectric energy in the river stretch is 1 12 1011 w the highest of china s thirteen planned hydropower dams four hydropower stations downstream of the jinsha river were built i e the dams of wudongde baihetan xiluodu and xiangjiaba shown in fig 1a from upstream to downstream the combined installed capacity of these dams is around 4 48 1010 w which on an annual average produces 1 91 1014 w h the xjb hydropower station was officially put into operation on july 2014 xjb is the last reservoir in the cascade of the jinsha river with a large canyon shape located in the subtropical zone 28 6441 n 104 3928 e as shown in fig 1b it is a typical channel type reservoir with a dam height of 162 m which controls a watershed area of 45 88 104 km2 with a multi year average discharge of 3810 m3 s the normal water level of the xjb has been 380 m since its impoundment in 2012 with a corresponding storage capacity being 49 78 108 m3 the xjb has a considerable backwater length of 160 km and the reservoir s water depth has increased from 10 m upstream to 120 m downstream as it approaches the dam thus the inflow spans through multiple regions i e the riverine transitional and lacustrine zones when subjected to heat exchange the shallow waters in the riverine zone could reflect the meteorological forcing more immediately and sensitively than the deeper waters in the lacustrine zone leading to the inflow reservoir water temperature difference 2 2 field measurement and data collection to understand the thermal regimes of the large channel type reservoir and its environmental and ecological impact we set 6 monitoring points xjb01 xjb06 shown in fig 1b along the reservoir to measure the water temperature c turbidity fnu and chlorophyll a ug l profiles in the spring season 2021 05 the ysi exo2 multi parameter water column profiler was used for profile monitoring the profile time was adjusted to allow the sondes to be submerged in the water progressively and avoid strong disturbances to guarantee that the measurement was not affected by the probe s response time the discrepancy in density between the inflow and reservoir water was used to determine the hydrodynamics water temperature suspended sediment and mineralization were mainly used to determine the water density in the given freshwater reservoir herein the water temperatures and conductivity for both inflow and reservoir were measured on a monthly cycle through ysi the reservoir s water mineralization was derived from the linear equation reported by lyubimova et al 2014 and tishchenko et al 2019 the field measured sediment datasets were reported in detail by yin et al 2016 but they only concentrated on the flood season for the lack of sediment data in the dry season the measured turbidity in april and may was chosen to invert the sediment concentration and the regression relationship between them can be found in ji et al 2010 the hydrological datasets including water temperature water level and inflow outflow discharge were observed at the xiluodu and xiangjiba hydrologic stations http www ctgpc com cn sxjt sqqk the meteorological elements including air temperature and wind parameters see table 1 were observed at suijiang station http www cma gov cn the position of both hydrologic and meteorological stations is shown in fig 1b all of the above hydrological and meteorological data were measured in 2014 and used for model simulation in addition the vertical temperature profiles in xjb02 xjb05 and xjb06 see fig 1b were monitored monthly in 2014 utilizing a thermistor sensor these data were used for model verification 2 3 density difference calculation the density flow which has a considerable impact on the hydrodynamics in the reservoir is induced by the inflow reservoir density difference the difference in this fresh reservoir is mainly brought about by the spatial discrepancy of water temperature or suspended sediment as well as the water mineralization herein at any given temperature t the water density ρ t is computed using eq 1 martin et al 1999 1 ρ t 1 t 288 9414 t 3 9863 2 508929 2 t 68 12963 1000 the water density induced by the sediment concentrations ρ s is derived as the following shi et al 2022 2 ρ s ρ w 1 ρ w ρ s o l i d h the water density induced by the water mineralization ρ m obeys the following law lyubimova et al 2014 3 ρ m ρ w 0 702 m where ρ w and ρ s o l i d are the water and sediment density kg m3 respectively h and m are sediment concentration kg m3 and the mass concentration of dissolved salts kg m3 2 4 model description and set up 2 4 1 3d hydro thermodynamic model after the impoundment of the xjb the water depth increased and the water surface width expanded for most deep river type reservoirs in the yangtze river basin the vertical scale 100 m is much smaller than the longitudinal 100 km and lateral scales 1 km for such a small aspect ratio depth width depth length the shallow water assumption is valid which means that the vertical momentum equation is reduced to the hydrostatic pressure relation therefore vertical accelerations are assumed to be small compared to gravitational acceleration and are therefore not taken into account 3d flow and thermal conditions were simulated employing delft3d flow packages to solve the rans equations for incompressible fluids over whole depth under the hydrostatic and boussinesq assumptions the convection diffusion equations were also solved for water and material transport delft3d flow packages have been widely used in lakes rivers and reservoirs to address produce the hydro thermodynamic processes with high accuracy dissanayake et al 2019 2020b de carvalho bueno et al 2021 morovati et al 2022 this model took into account the baroclinic effect on density flow a significant hydro thermal dynamic factor in reservoir investigations we used k ε turbulence model to predict the vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity we also utilized the alternative direction implicit adi technique to solve the equations with second order precision in time and space the velocity and water temperature distributions could be derived by executing this model the study region encompasses the xjb s mainstream which has a total length of 160 km see fig 1b horizontally the study area adopts an orthogonal curved grid with a cell size being 150 m longitudinal 80 m lateral in the vertical direction due to the steep bed slope v shaped valley in the study region the σ coordinates would produce numerical errors in the positions of the density iso surfaces cornelissen et al 2004 therefore the z coordinates were employed in the model in total 50 vertical layers were used with thicknesses of 3 m based on the size of the grid cell a time step of the 30 s was set in this model two open boundaries were set including the inlet and outlet boundaries fig 1b the inlet boundary was located downstream of the xld dam fig 1a it was established by the daily average water temperature and flow discharge see fig 2a b and table 1 observed at the xiluodu station the outlet boundary near the xjb dam was defined by using the water temperature and water level fig 2a b and table 1 measured at the xjb station for the real settings of water intakes and spillways of the dam a total of 8 intakes with their intake height ranging from 342 m 357 m 12 upper holes top elevation is 354 m and 8 middle spillway holes bottom elevation is 342 m for releasing flood discharge from a height range perspective the intakes and spillway holes are basically overlapped consequently we set two huge 3 d gates one is set from the riverbed to 342 m and the other is from 357 m to the water surface so that a big mouth 342 357 m can be left for discharge under this hypothesis we think the combined effects of both intakes and spillway devices have been considered due to the both the water intakes and spillways setting in the middle upper layer 342 357 m 3 d gates were used to splice into intakes in the model the riverbed was assumed to be an impermeable slip boundary and the manning equation was utilized to model the bed friction see table s1 in the supplementary material sm file since the water level is regulated variably so do the shorelines to maintain the mass and momentum conservation in the developed model a wetting drying algorithm was used to define the model boundaries deltares 2014 in addition the meteorological condition has a crucial impact on the water motions and thermal regimes by providing external forces the wind stress and surface heat flux were taken into account in this model the heat flux was computed based on the excess temperature heat model at the air water interface modeling the effect of a thermal discharge deltares 2014 according to this model the heat transfer coefficient mostly depends on the water temperature and wind speed the wind stress impact on the water surface was considered in the developed model see table s1 in the sm file thus we collected the daily meteorological data at the suijiang station fig 2c d and table 1 2 4 2 water age model the retention time of the inflow water was described using water age different from the overall retention time v q the water age was a local concept and the age in the reservoir can be unequal at different layers in the water age model the conservative tracer was used to mark the inflow water the water age of the tracer was set to zero when the tracer was first introduced into the reservoir and it increased with time unless the tracer flowed out of the reservoir the surrounding water usually has a greater retention time than the inflow water entering the reservoir so that the water transport path can be intuitively distinguished wu et al 2016 thus water age was an excellent predictor of the flow pattern and thermal structure water age was calculated from the tracer concentrations and its age concentrations the transport equations used to calculate these concentrations are as follows deleersnijder et al 2001 4 c t u c w c z d h c z d v c z 5 α t u α w α z d h α z d v α z c 6 a α c where the variables c α and a are the tracer concentrations age concentrations and water age respectively u u v and w denote the velocity components in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively d h is the diffusivity value in the horizontal direction and d v is the diffusivity value in the vertical direction is the hamiltonian operator x y the water age model herein was constructed by altering the typical advection diffusion components in the code packages in accordance with eq 4 6 where the changed codes can be seen in the data availability section 2 5 model calibration and validation the in situ measured temperature datasets collected at the sample locations depicted in fig 1b were used for model calibrations and validations to determine the correctness of the simulations the mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse are utilized 7 m a e i 1 n x o b s i x mod e l i n 8 r m s e i 1 n x o b s i x m o d e l i 2 n fig 3 shows the water temperature verification at three monitoring points along the mainstream including xjb02 xjb05 and xjb06 the location of these monitoring points is shown in fig 1b the predicted vertical temperature profiles follow relatively close to the field measured ones with high accuracy attributed to the thermocline placements relative to field observations for the majority of the observation sites mae 0 18 1 15 c rmse 0 19 1 20 c fig 3 to further validate model s accuracy both surface and bottom water temperature results at the xjb06 are compared with measured data see fig 4 for mixing and stratified periods as seen the developed model tends to underestimate surface temperature over the stratified period greater accuracy is attributed to the mixing period in both surface and bottom locations the corresponding mea and rmse values at the surface layer are 0 63 and 0 80 respectively and for the bottom layer are 0 57 and 0 79 respectively these well validated results shown in figs 3 and 4 indicate that the developed 3d hydro thermodynamic model is capable of reproducing the seasonal changes in thermal stratification and water temperature 3 results 3 1 physicochemical property 3 1 1 density difference in reservoirs the flow field is greatly influenced by the density flows which are caused by spatial distributions of the water temperature or suspended sediment franca 2017 munoz et al 2020 in this study the temperature induced sediment induced as well as mineralization induced density differences are calculated respectively fig 5 for the former the temperature difference between inflow and hypolimnion water in the reservoir is considered this is mainly due to a large temperature difference between inflow and hypolimnion water in the reservoir during the stratification period fig s1 which would be a primary factor than the inflow surface one in driving density flows for the latter the sediment and mineralization derived by the conductivity difference between the inflow and reservoir waters is considered where the sectional sediment concentration and mineralization in mean are collected for both inflow and reservoir waters in the yangtze river the suspended sediment concentration has decreased severely over the last decades due to the large number of dams being built within the jinsha river s catchment while the thermal processes in those reservoirs are significant sun et al 2021a and 2021b consequently the average density difference induced by the sediment 0 01 kg m3 calculated by eq 2 is far lower than that induced by the temperature 0 48 kg m3 calculated by eq 1 as shown in fig 5a from the perspective of a season the density difference shows significant seasonal variations as shown in fig 5b during the dry season the sediment induced density difference calculated by the turbidity data fluctuates around 0 01 kg m3 the corresponding temperature induced density difference ranges from 0 1 kg m3 to 1 kg m3 in the xjb in the dry season shown in fig 5a which is far greater than the sediment induced density difference during the flood season as shown in fig 5b i e june october the sediment induced density difference increased slightly and ranged from 0 01 to 0 05 kg m3 however the temperature induced density difference in this season rose sharply and the maximum value can be 1 50 kg m3 dozens of times as much as the sediment in addition in this freshwater reservoir the mineralization dissolved salinity is relatively small with conductivities between 320 and 410 μs cm for both the upper and lower reaches fig s2 the induced density difference calculated by eq 3 is on the order of 0 01 kg m3 significantly smaller than the density difference due to temperature figs 5a and 5b moreover the spatial conductivities are presented in figs 6s 6x with evenly vertical distributions in upper reach xjb01 xjb03 vertical difference 0 3 7 μs cm and slight variation in lower reach xjb04 xjb06 vertical difference 7 22 7 μs cm as a result we have assumed that there were no significant salinity gradients based on this small vertical difference in the reservoir water column and therefore no density gradient to summarize we concluded that the xjb s thermal regime is the most influential factor regulating the hydrodynamic process 3 1 2 spatial environmental and ecological indexes in spring the spatial environmental and ecological index profiles including water temperature turbidity and chlorophyll a are shown in fig 6 the profiles xjb01 xjb06 are measured along the reservoir from the upstream to the downstream in the spring season the position of these measured profiles can be seen in fig 1b during this season the temperature is stratified in the lower reach xjb04 xjb06 see fig 6d f while mixed uniformly in the upper reach xjb01 xjb03 see fig 6a c of the xjb in the lower reach the seasonal thermocline developed at around a depth of 55 75 m where a weak diurnal stratification occurs randomly in the upper depth of 0 20 m due to the measured time of the day the turbidity in the reservoir is relatively small within 10 ftu the vertical profiles change from the nearly uniform structure in the upstream fig 6g i to the weak stratification in the downstream fig 6j l similarly the conductivity profiles measured along xiangjiaba reservoir show consistent trends for either upstream mixing or weak downstream stratification field observations in this season reveal that the vertical distribution of chlorophyll a is basically consistent with thermal structures in the upper reach see fig 6m o but not downstream however the chlorophyll a in the downstream xjb04 xjb06 see fig 6p r is always more abundant in the surface layer which seems consistent with the temperature of the water surface fig 6d f this is related to the thermal structures where the downstream experienced stratified condition while the mixed condition dominated the upper reach in addition the reservoir presented higher temperatures than shallow regions upper reach these combined effects would explain higher chlorophyll a distribution in the surface layer mullin et al 2020 3 2 hydrothermal dynamic process 3 2 1 longitudinal vertical cross sectional thermal structures to analyze the thermal structures in this reservoir the longitudinal vertical distributions of the water temperature in the xjb are sorted from january to december in fig 7 and the corresponding flow patterns gray arrows are depicted in this figure as well as shown in fig 7 the thermal regimes in the xjb show seasonal variation features i e the vertical temperature structure is stratified from april to august while mixed uniformly in other months from january to march fig 7a c although the temperature difference exists between the inflow and reservoir waters fig s1 the generated water temperature gradients in the vertical direction of the reservoir are relatively small 0 15 c m gray et al 2020 this is mainly due to the formation of underflow and unidirectional flow these macroscopic hydrodynamic processes tend to promote water mixing in the reservoir song et al 2009 ceng et al 2016 from april to august fig 7d h a tangible pattern i e thermal stratification is observed according to the spatial evolution of the water temperature in april the inflow water temperature is warmer than the reservoir middle lower water fig s1 fig 7d so that the inflow water floats above the thermocline of the reservoir as a result the maximum vertical temperature gradient can be higher than 0 15 c m resulting in temperature stratification in the reservoir in this season the thermal stratification stretches from 60th km to 150th km 90 km away from the dam covering a broad range within 60th km to upstream the water depth gradually decreases and more water channel features are presented and thus the thermal buoyancy induced stratification disappears with the continuous increase in inflow temperature from may to june the temperature of the surface water temperature rises while the temperature of the bottom remains almost unchanged the vertical stratification is strengthened and its range is enlarged in the longitudinal direction due to the increase in the surface bottom temperature difference since july the thermal stratification has been alleviated i e the epilimnion is thickened while the hypolimnion is compressed and the stretch of the thermal stratification along the thalweg is decreased from 100th km to 150th km 50 km to dam front this is due to the great inflow discharge in the flood season 104 m3 s see fig 2a inducing strong vertical turbulence and making the hypolimnion water mix fast with that in the upper layer this turbulent behavior is enhanced again in august with increasing flow discharge leading to further weakening of thermal stratification with the hypolimnion water shrinking in both vertical and longitudinal directions in september fig 7i the stratified thermal structure recesses with its spatial reach shrunk to none in the following months fig 7j l the inflow temperature was closer to the reservoir water and the reservoir achieved a mixing state 3 2 2 longitudinal vertical cross sectional flow patterns velocity profiles along the thalweg of the xjb are illustrated in fig 8 throughout the year the velocity magnitude is relatively small in the lower reach of the xjb lacustrine zone however from the downstream to the upstream the velocity increases as the water depth decreases especially in the upstream xjb riverine zone the flow rate is magnified dozens of times the macroscopic flow patterns in the large reservoir depend closely on the thermal regimes as the duration of velocity stratification overlaps with the temperature stratification by a large margin the flow field in the reservoir shows seasonal variations a typical flow pattern is found consisting of an upper layer warm water flow in the epilimnion overflow and a lower layer circulation in the hypolimnion which occurred mainly in the stratification periods and occupied 51 in an annual cycle fig 8 m underflow and unidirectional flow are also remarkable flow paths accounting for 7 and 41 fig 8 m respectively persistent underflow conditions mainly occurred before the long stratified periods during which the inflow temperature was slightly lower than that of the reservoir during other mixed periods the upper and lower layers experience almost identical velocity as a result downward flows occupy almost the entire reservoir in the first two months of the cooling periods january and february the upstream inflow tends to intrude into the reservoir s lower layer this is because the inflow water with low temperature is slightly denser than the reservoir s surface water in this season underflow and unidirectional flow are predominant fig 8a b since march the inflow water temperature has gradually increased when the temperature is greater than the reservoir water the reservoir provides denser water than the inflow water thus floating on the reservoir in the form of a downward buoyant flow meanwhile a clockwise circulation in the hypolimnion is generated fig 8c h from the seasonal scale this circulation structure is not stable but a process of formation development and extinction among them in the formation stage march april the circulation structure is formed initially with the increasing water temperature in the longitudinal direction its influencing range can be traced back to the middle or even upper reach of the reservoir where the hypolimnion water is transported to the 60th through the circulation in may june as the inflow water temperature continues to rise the enlarged water temperature discrepancy between the inflow and the reservoir further stabilizes this flow structures and the water transport scopes of the circulation are further expanded to the 30th km i e as far as 120 km away from the dam in july the circulation in the hypolimnion shrunk for both the longitudinal and vertical directions and gradually disappeared in august this is due to the intensified turbulent diffusion caused by the great inflow discharge fig 2a after september the surface bottom velocity difference decreases with the enhanced turbulent mixing induced by the sharp upstream inflow discharge as a result the flow is unidirectional in the reservoir fig 8i l to summarize although the calibrated and validated 3d model could well reproduce the spatial and seasonal distribution of thermal stratification the macroscopic flow patterns during the stratified periods are established only on the basis of the performed computational experiments however this kind of flow consisting of a surface overflow and hypolimnion circulation or reverse flow in the bottom layer was inferred or estimated in several references such as in kala reservoir li et al 2014 and xiluodu reservoir xie 2018 3 2 3 water age distributions in the longitudinal vertical plane water age at any location is utilized to depict the elapsed time for water parcels from the inflow different from the turnover timescale i e the ratio of reservoir volume v to inflow discharge q sun et al 2021a and 2021b the water age is a local concept and the age in the reservoir can be unequable at different layers especially when the water temperature and flow are stratified the retention time of the surface and bottom layers would have a significant discrepancy fig 9 shows the monthly average water age in the longitudinal vertical plane the same thalweg positions and periods as fig 8 the water age in the riverine zone is homogeneous throughout the year however the majority of the reservoir s areas are deep enough to exhibit mixing and stratification patterns in the varying seasons during the mixing period in autumn and winter as shown in figs 9a b and 9i l the water age near the dam is less than 20 days which can also be estimated according to the turnover timescale v q the water age in the hypolimnion layer rises gradually during the stratification period which is greater than the epilimnion layer in the spring and this trend remains constant until summer see fig 9c h this phenomenon is due to the combination of the thermocline induced hindrance and hypolimnion circulation loops in this season which have an obstructed effect on the vertical water exchange to be specific the water age in the upper layer in this season is small but increases downward longitudinally with its age value following the turnover timescale v q this is mainly because the inflow water enters as a buoyant surface flow which flows on the thermocline without hindrance however affected by the hypolimnion circulation in this season the cold water in the lower layer is trapped as a result the bottom cold water age will accumulate severely no longer consistent with the turnover timescale in march the circulation initially forms in the lower layer and the bottom layer s water age can be up to 60 days see fig 9c with the circulation development the bottom water age continues to increase see fig 9d h and can be up to four months in june see fig 9f after july as the inflow discharge increases significantly the vertical turbulent mixing is intensified so that the high age deep water layer is gradually compressed and completely disappears until august in brief the ranges of the lower layer water age are basically consistent with the corresponding flow circulations while the age of the upper layer follows the path of surface warm water movement 3 3 seasonal variations of water temperature and age in typical regions a transition from the river to the xjb exists since it is categorized as a channel type reservoir with a large longitudinal scale the hydrodynamics and water temperature along the reservoir show different seasonal spatial variations in this study we select the typical regions i e the riverine transition and lacustrine zone the positions can be seen in fig 1b to analyze the spatial difference between the thermal structure and water age in the xjb as shown in fig 10 and fig 11 as shown in fig 10 a c the vertical water temperature distribution is relatively uniform throughout the year in the riverine zone in contrast in the lacustrine zone the stratification occurs from april to august and the thermocline position shifts downward correspondingly from the surface and bottom water temperatures perspective as shown in fig 10 d f the surface and bottom layers temperatures in the riverine zone basically coincide throughout the year in the lacustrine the surface and bottom layers temperatures separate from the beginning of april and coincide with the end of august the maximum discrepancy in this period can be up to 8 70 which occurred in mid july the water temperature in the transition zone is in a state of weaker stratification i e shorter stratified duration and advanced maximum surface bottom temperature difference in june 7 35 in addition for the lacustrine zone of xjb a thick thermocline with dual layers is produced mainly in may july the rising surface water temperature during the heating periods promotes the generation of the upper thermocline layer which is primarily affected by meteorological factors such as great solar radiation and high air temperature meanwhile the large inflow discharge in this season increases the shear stress on the thermocline making the upper hypolimnion cold water participates in the turbulence energy transfer thus the hypolimnion scope shrinks and a lower thermocline is formed in the reservoir with the further inflow discharge increase in flood season the cold water in the hypolimnion is involved in turbulence which would be entrained to the metalimnion or epilimnion until the down cline disappears the dual thermocline phenomenon is the combination of both net air water heat exchange and epilimnion buoyant warm flow a comparison of the water ages in three zones shows that the riverine water age is stable at about 2 days throughout the year mainly due to the small water depth the large flow velocity and rapid renewal in the water column see fig 11 however the lacustrine water age begins to stratify in mid march and can last until the end of august specifically as depicted in fig 11f the surface water age is small throughout the year in contrast the bottom water age increased almost linearly from 38 days in mid march to a maximum of 115 days in mid july with an average growth rate of approximately 0 67 days day highlighting that a low water exchange occurred between the bottom and surface during this period since mid july the bottom water age sharply reduced and basically coincided with the surface water age 5 days in september during this period the bottom water age dropped severely at a rate of 2 21 days day this was mainly due to the inflow discharge increase during the flooding season enhancing the vertical turbulent mixing and breaking the stratified structure to renew the bottom water overall by comparing the riverine transition and lacustrine water temperature and age we can conclude that the stratification duration surface bottom temperature difference and the bottom water age renewal are varied significantly with the water depth increase along the reservoir 4 discussion 4 1 role of the inflow on the hydro thermal processes in the reservoir in general reservoirs are regarded as semi natural water bodies gozdowski et al 2022 but they differ from lakes in multiple ways li et al 2013 mostafa et al 2021 previous research has found that in a stratified lake the thermal stratification is influenced by surface heat flux and wind stress which further contributes to the development of the flow circulations stevens et al 1996 ulloa et al 2018 ishikawa et al 2021 the wind induced component is frequently transient and has a tendency to cancel out in the mean but the thermally driven component i e the baroclinic effects is more constant wu et al 2021 in addition to surface heat flux and wind stress this study found that in large channel type reservoirs the inflow temperature and discharge can also be dominant factors affecting the thermal structure and flow patterns three sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate address the potential forcing mechanisms by separately eliminating the wind induced momentum m1 surface heat flux m2 and inflow m3 while holding other forcing components constant see table s2 for parameter settings fig s4 s9 shows the results of the thermal structure and flow patterns with hypothetical situations m1 m3 obtained by the hydrodynamic model in the case of m1 the wind stress was not taken into account and was set to zero thus the hydrodynamics in this scenario was mainly driven by the surface heat flux and inflow flux the impact of the wind induced surface momentum fluxes can be evaluated by comparing the results in base m0 and m1 slight discrepancies exist between these two scenarios m0 and m1 for example the alteration of the thermal regimes is limited on the surface layer fig s4a b and s5a this is because the wind induced mixing is usually confined in the topmost layer the frequency of occurrence of the unidirectional flow and the potential underflow are decreased and increased respectively fig s9 and this discrepancy is mostly seen in december fig 8 and fig s6 however the wind driven mixing is expected to have a small impact on the xjb due to multiple reasons firstly the narrow channel reservoir s shape provides less effective surface area for wind stress secondly the mountain on both sides of the reservoir has a certain shielding effect on the wind resulting in mild wind speeds 99 of the values 2 5 m s fig 2c thirdly the reservoir lacustrine zone is mainly characterized by the deep waters water depth 100 m and the wind cannot overturn the whole water column in the scenario m1 without wind the water temperature structure in the vertical direction fig s4b as well as the thermal stability sst fig s5g are generally close to the base case m0 including the duration strength and evolution of the stratification correspondingly the flow patterns in m1 fig s6 are similar to that in m0 during both mixing and stratified periods i e featured a unidirectional flow or a potential underflow during the mixing period combination of the epilimnion overflow and hypolimnion circulation during the stratified periods fig 8 and fig s6 this suggests that wind stress plays a minor effect in forming the thermal stratification and driving the flow patterns in case m2 the surface heat flux is set to zero hence its effect on the hydro thermal processes can be obtained by comparing it with m0 changes in surface heat flux have a trifle influence on the thermal structure and this influence is enlarged during the mixing period fig s4a c this is because both lower radiation and air temperature in this period fig 2d reduce the net heat flow leading to negative buoyancy fluxes and lowering the surface water temperature fig s5b moreover given no surface heat flux the flow patterns are altered into the potential underflow in this period except for the flood season september and october see fig s7 on the contrary the positive surface flux during the stratified periods could raise surface water temperature and thus enhance thermal stability fig s5h however the thermal structure i e thermocline position stratified duration see fig s4c and flow patterns dominated by epilimnion overflow and hypolimnion circulation see fig s7 in m2 showed remarkable resemblance with the base run m0 suggesting the surface heat flux has a relatively limited influence on the hydro thermal processes case m3 contained purely inflow driven barotropic discharge and baroclinic temperature dynamics as both the wind induced surface momentum flux and surface heat flux are set to zero the thermal structure in this scenario fig s4d showed great resemblance with the m1 and m2 as well as the base run m0 suggesting the inflow flux plays an essential role in the thermal structure from fig s8 the spatial distributions of flow patterns in m3 during the mixing period showed a slight distinction from the other cases m0 m2 mainly reflected in the presence of the underflow or unidirectional flow however during the stratified period a common phenomenon can be found i e the flow currents featured an epilimnion overflow and hypolimnion circulation in the simulations m0 m3 this further confirms the dominance of inflow flux in driving the flow patterns 4 2 thermocline descent during the stratification period the pycnocline thermocline in the xjb is a region between the upper and lower layers with elevated density gradients in the vertical directions which could develop as the water column in the lake reservoir stratifies during spring and summer noori et al 2019 it initially forms near the surface but tends to move downward as the stratification strength increases as shown in section 3 2 figs 10b and 10c previous scholars have extensively demonstrated that lakes thermocline decline was affected by wind induced currents and vertical thermal convection meanwhile the relevant empirical formulas between the thermocline decline rates and the influencing factors are established pollard et al 1973 imboden et al 1995 however the thermocline decline in the river type deep reservoirs is influenced greatly by the water flow demonstrated in section 4 1 but this research is rare the development of the thermocline in the xjb is depicted in fig 12a by a contoured map of the buoyancy frequency squared i e n 2 n 2 g ρ ρ z which is calculated from the density profiles ρ z fischer et al 1979 simpson et al 2021 significant stability gradients n 2 10 5 s 2 are observed in the upper water of the xjb after late march or early april and a more intense gradient n 2 10 4 s 2 is formed just below the surface and rapidly dropping to the elevation of 340 m water depth 35 m thereafter this thermocline slowly deepened from april to august with a high gradient interface with a value of 5 10 4 s 2 the inflow warm water is restricted on the stabilized thermocline during the stratified period fig 7d h and the flow currents in the reservoir are stratified into two layers i e an upper layer warm water flow and a lower layer circulation in hypolimnion fig 13b the upper layer experiences a greater velocity than the lower layer shown in fig 13a thus a shear layer is generated to enhance the turbulence induced diffusion and further increase the mixing of upper and lower layers derived from the model velocity data in fig 12b we show a corresponding contoured map of the shear squared i e s 2 u z 2 v z 2 where u and v are the longitudinal and cross sectional velocity components respectively the color scale is the same as the n 2 plot so that the identical colors correspond to the order unity of the richardson number i e r i n 2 s 2 tanimoto et al 2020 simpson et al 2021 high gradient regions in n 2 and s 2 have a tendency to follow each other as they decline over time throughout the stratification phase but the occurrence of high s 2 is visibly more sporadic in time than the continuous progression of n 2 these graphs of n 2 and s 2 indicate a thermocline in a condition of borderline stability with shear peaks triggering mixing events the shear layer is just located on the thermocline where the turbulent energy dissipation ε and the vertical eddy diffusivity both vary inversely with the richardson number ri as shown in figs 12c and 12d during the formation phase of the stratification the ri increases from 100 to 103 correspondingly the ε drops from 10 7 to 10 11 w kg and the d v drops from 10 2 to 10 6 m2 s this suggests that the turbulent energy is dissipated slowly and the turbulent diffusion is inhibited due to the strengthened buoyance force and vice versa during the weakness phase in this stratified process the shear stress induced by the surface bottom velocity difference will have entrainment on the upper hypolimnion layer as a result the upper hypolimnion layer will be a part of the metalimnion or even epilimnion and the hypolimnion scope is shrinking fig 8c h therefore the thermocline descends in the stratification period moreover during the weakening period of the stratification july august with rising inflow discharge the warm overflow in the epilimnion evolved into a buoyant jet and the flow velocity difference between the upper and lower layers is magnified sharply fig 13a thereby the shear stress is enhanced the thermocline is deepened and the hypolimnion is compressed or even disappears due to being withdrawn directly in upper surface intake the epilimnion becomes the main channel for the warm surface flows directly affected by the rising inflow water temperature the epilimnion water which is carried by the surface plume warms faster than the hypolimnion the expanded temperature difference stabilizes the vertical stratified structure and maintains the stable surface flow under these circumstances the water in the epilimnion is renewed rapidly while in the hypolimnion it can be retained for a long time 4 3 ecological implication both the thermal structure and the macroscopic flow patterns are highly correlated with the water age distributions fig 9 during the mixing periods the water flow is either unidirectional or potential underflow allowing the upstream water to flow straight and unimpededly forward into the reservoir without stratification in this period the water age shows substantial uniformity in the vertical direction and its magnitude is similar to the estimation of v q however during the stratified periods the thermocline is formed as a barrier to hinder the water exchange between the lower and upper layers thus the water age shows distinct discrepancies at different layers i e with a low value in the surface layer and a high value in the bottom layer fig 9 meanwhile the water flows in the reservoir are featured by an overflow and a lower circulation on the one hand the inflow warm water behaved as an overflow probably contributing to vertical thermal stratification ishikawa et al 2021 enhancing the thermocline and its hindering effect on the other hand the surface mixed layer is flushed preferentially by the overflow pilotti et al 2014 i e the warm buoyant flow has a minor exchange with the layer below correspondingly the cold water is stuck retained in a hypolimnion loop due to the trap effect of the lower layer circulation and has little exchange with the upper layer water given the combination of the thermocline induced hindrance and circulation loops the cold water in the hypolimnion layer retained largely and water age in this layer can reach up to 115 days in july the hydro thermal processes not only affect the water renewal in the reservoir but can also be relevant for variations of the water environmental indicators affected by large flow velocity and strong vertical turbulence in the riverine and the transition zone xjb01 xjb03 indicators such as turbidity fig 6g i conductivities fig 6s u and chlorophyll a fig 6m o in the water column are mixed uniformly however the water environment becomes heterogeneous due to the increasing stratification duration and strength downward the stratified water column can affect the water quality biological productivity and functional phytoplankton composition and community in the reservoir mullin et al 2020 shilei et al 2020 in the lacustrine zone these indicators including turbidity fig 6j l conductivities fig 6v x and chlorophyll a fig 6p r are stratified in the vertical direction at the lower part of the hypolimnion circulations the water flows upstream ward which can transport bottom water upstream ward as far as 100 km fig 8 which has potential influences on nutrients transport and ecological system especially benthos habitats in addition the macroscopic flow patterns can be associated with algal growth if the inflow water is the primary source of nutrients for the reservoir for example the nutrients from the inflow water can be delivered to the photic zones which are expected to boost phytoplankton growth macintyre et al 2006 rueda et al 2007 accompanied by deep water and relatively low flow velocity in the lacustrine zone a relatively static water environment is provided for the growth of phytoplankton also the thermocline formation restricts the vertical nutrient exchange in the water column so that some nutrients may accumulate in the reservoir surface layer combined with the suitable water temperature the chlorophyll concentrations in the surface layer are higher fig 6p r 5 conclusions by developing a 3d numerical model and using measured data the hydro thermal processes in a sizeable channel type reservoir xjb were explored findings contributed to the existing studies by providing new insights into how hydro thermal processes including thermal stratification and macroscopic flow patterns occur in large channel type reservoirs serious thermal stratification was found in the reservoir from april to august with the maximum surface bottom water temperature difference being 9 c meanwhile a conjoint flow pattern induced by the warm inflow was detected consisting of an upper layer warm flow and a lower layer circulation which was very different from the wind induced pattern in lakes herein the varying seasonal inflow flux played an essential role while the wind stress and the surface heat flux played minor roles mainly when the reservoir is stratified the inflow warm water on the thermocline could produce a shear effect promoting vertical mixing and further contributing to seasonal hypolimnion shrinking the water transport timescale through the reservoir was influenced heavily by the thermal stratification and flow pattern when the stratification was absent the flow was unidirectional the water age was uniform vertically and increased along the reservoir however when the water column was stratified vertically the hypolimnion cold water was trapped severely by the lower layer circulation with the bottom age value being up to 115 days variations in the water timescale would potentially affect the eco environmental system e g serious residence time in hypolimnion suggests a lack of fresh water for a long time this may lead to anoxic conditions and impede sediment released nutrient exchange in the long run the reservoir water quality will be degraded during the stratification and the benthos abundance will be affected ecologically from a hydrothermal point of view our findings provide theoretical and practical support for managing water quality and the aquatic environment in the reservoirs in our simulations we quantified the impacts of the external forces on the large scale hydro thermal processes of the reservoir through averaging in a long time scale we smoothed over the smaller time scale mechanisms e g thermal convection and wind induced internal waves however they will contribute to the evolution of instantaneous flow patterns and thermal structures their inclusions would be a valuable step in developing a high fidelity numerical modeling for example non hydrostatic simulations although the present research brought new insights regarding the qualitative interpretations of the macroscopic flow patterns to ecological indicators section 4 3 the relationships between hydro thermodynamic processes and ecological dynamics are complicated and quantifications of the contribution to phytoplankton dynamics are required in the future it is therefore recommended to extend this model to an ecological hydrodynamic model so as to illustrate the response of dissolved oxygen nutrients and phytoplankton to the hydrodynamic behaviors credit authorship contribution statement lidi shi conceptualization methodology validation data curation formal analysis resources

7629,study region this study was conducted in xiangjiaba reservoir located in the jinsha river china s upper reach of the yangtze river study focus large channel type reservoirs are characterized by significant runoff deep water and narrow and long channel shape creating unique hydrodynamic and thermodynamic conditions for their eco environmental systems however the hydro thermal processes of this type reservoir are not fully known a large channel type reservoir was selected to investigate the macroscopic processes through a field survey and employing a three dimensional 3d hydro thermodynamic model new hydrological insights for the region the reservoir experienced a seasonal varying thermal stratification with a vertical temperature difference of 9 c meanwhile a conjoint flow pattern was detected consisting of an upper layer warm water flow and a lower layer circulation which was very different from the lakes wind induced pattern when the reservoir was stratified the inflow warm water on the thermocline could produce a shear effect promoting vertical mixing and further contributing to hypolimnion shrinking the reservoir experienced a water age increase during the non stratification period with the near dam age being 20 days the trap effect of the lower layer circulation retained the cold water in the hypolimnion during the stratification period and the water age reached 115 days the presented varying flow pattern and transport timescale have essential effects on the eco environmental systems providing practical insights into managing water quality and aquatic environment in reservoirs graphical abstract ga1 keywords macroscopic flow patterns thermal stratification water age large channel type reservoir data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction reservoir plays an essential role in flood control water supply and power production when a reservoir is built in a river the thermodynamic conditions are commonly altered by increasing the water depth slowing the water flow and extending residence time li et al 2020a 2020b morovati et al 2022 thus vertical thermal stratification frequently occurs the stratified water columns are portrayed as a region of sharply varying temperatures metalimnion delineating an upper isothermal region epilimnion from a relatively static deeper region hypolimnion becker et al 2010 this vertical water column partition significantly affects the reservoir s entire aquatic ecology including water quality eutrophication nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics chen et al 2009 for example due to the stratification the surface bottom connectivity is suppressed giving rise to a nutrient rich but colder hypolimnion and a nutrient poor but warmer epilimnion read et al 2011 additionally the enhanced stratification can lead to increased phytoplankton aggregation in the epilimnion posing a significant threat to water quality paerl et al 2009 therefore it is paramount to understand the thermal structure evolutions for the comprehensive optimal management of reservoir water quality previous research on the thermal stratification and mixing process in natural waters has mainly focused on lakes or lake type reservoirs characterized by weak flows zhang et al 2014 2015 liu et al 2020 in subtropical or tropical monomictic lakes or reservoirs the stratification on a seasonal cycle of the water column results from the competition of the turbulent mixing events primarily driven by wind induced momentum noori et al 2019 and air water heat exchange saber et al 2018 the stratifying effects of surface heat input in summer and spring outweigh vertical mixing developing a stabilized regime of strong stratification this continues until autumn when the reservoirs commence losing heat to the atmosphere then the stratification is eroded under the combined impact of wind stress and heat loss inducing fall turnover events subsequently vertical mixing typically persists throughout the winter until the following early spring when surface heat input resumes recovers in recent decades dam constructions have caused significant changes in fluvial systems worldwide dudgeon 2000 pedroso et al 2014 with 63 of very long rivers in the world being influenced by reservoirs grill et al 2019 as a result the channel type reservoirs are formed based on the original river channel type reservoirs differ from lakes and lake type reservoirs in multiple ways mainly reflected in the geometric shapes and hydrodynamics li et al 2013 the channel type reservoirs retain the river channel shape i e the water depth and width are much smaller than the length given the larger inflows in such reservoirs the hydro thermodynamic process is more complex than the lake however most existing studies have focused on the correlation between the inflow elements e g discharge temperature and the stratification characteristics such as duration and strength becker et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 shi et al 2023 which are not adequate for understanding the influence of the inflow on the thermal regimes and flow patterns in the reservoir the inflow tends to affect the reservoir hydro thermodynamic process by producing a density flow regulating the reservoir thermal regimes the difference in inflow reservoir water density drives the density currents chung et al 2009 franca 2017 munoz et al 2020 mainly induced by the water temperature and sediment concentration difference usually the inflow with sediment is denser than the reservoir water which tends to produce an underflow chung et al 2009 in a stratified reservoir when the inflow water is less dense compared to the bottom water while denser than the surface water the interflow occurs in that case the vertical thermal structures are affected by the density currents in multiple aspects i e the thermal structure is not altered by the interflows but it is shifted from stratification to a mixed type by the underflows song et al 2009 ceng et al 2016 dam building could cause a significant decrease in suspended sediment concentration which has become the most crucial factor for sediment reduction sun et al 2021a and 2021b in a cascade reservoir system the incoming and reservoir sediment is significantly reduced by upstream dams and the effect of temperature induced density flow could become more critical chen et al 2015 chen et al 2016 shi et al 2022 until recently the research on the complex hydro thermodynamic process driven by the temperature induced density flow is more concentrated in the lake or sub reservoir lake type reservoir details are found in the researches conducted by woolway and simpson 2017 and simpson et al 2021 for the windermere lake in the uk and studies on sub reservoirs in the three gorges reservoir by yang et al 2015 and gao et al 2018 in these studies i e lakes and sub reservoirs the flow patterns are primarily driven by inhomogeneous water temperature distributions in spatial coates et al 1993 webster 2006 li et al 2020a 2020b however in a large channel type reservoir the water flows and the thermal structures are influenced by the combination of barotropic and baroclinic effects xie et al 2017 therefore the previous results from lakes or lake type reservoirs cannot be applied to the large channel type reservoirs and the hydro thermodynamics in such a sizeable channel type reservoir are not fully documented this research s primary objective is to investigate the macroscopic hydro thermodynamic processes in a sizeable channel type reservoir through a field survey and a 3d hydrodynamic model a detailed exploration of the reservoir on the water temperature velocity and water age as well as their spatial characteristics is carried out the interactions between hydro and thermo dynamic processes are analyzed and the seasonal variations are studied including the changing flow pattern thermocline decline and the bottom water age 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site located in the jinsha river as the upper reach of the yangtze river the xiangjiaba xjb reservoir categorized as a sizeable channel type reservoir was chosen as the study site in this study the jinsha river has abundant hydroelectric resources the hydroelectric energy in the river stretch is 1 12 1011 w the highest of china s thirteen planned hydropower dams four hydropower stations downstream of the jinsha river were built i e the dams of wudongde baihetan xiluodu and xiangjiaba shown in fig 1a from upstream to downstream the combined installed capacity of these dams is around 4 48 1010 w which on an annual average produces 1 91 1014 w h the xjb hydropower station was officially put into operation on july 2014 xjb is the last reservoir in the cascade of the jinsha river with a large canyon shape located in the subtropical zone 28 6441 n 104 3928 e as shown in fig 1b it is a typical channel type reservoir with a dam height of 162 m which controls a watershed area of 45 88 104 km2 with a multi year average discharge of 3810 m3 s the normal water level of the xjb has been 380 m since its impoundment in 2012 with a corresponding storage capacity being 49 78 108 m3 the xjb has a considerable backwater length of 160 km and the reservoir s water depth has increased from 10 m upstream to 120 m downstream as it approaches the dam thus the inflow spans through multiple regions i e the riverine transitional and lacustrine zones when subjected to heat exchange the shallow waters in the riverine zone could reflect the meteorological forcing more immediately and sensitively than the deeper waters in the lacustrine zone leading to the inflow reservoir water temperature difference 2 2 field measurement and data collection to understand the thermal regimes of the large channel type reservoir and its environmental and ecological impact we set 6 monitoring points xjb01 xjb06 shown in fig 1b along the reservoir to measure the water temperature c turbidity fnu and chlorophyll a ug l profiles in the spring season 2021 05 the ysi exo2 multi parameter water column profiler was used for profile monitoring the profile time was adjusted to allow the sondes to be submerged in the water progressively and avoid strong disturbances to guarantee that the measurement was not affected by the probe s response time the discrepancy in density between the inflow and reservoir water was used to determine the hydrodynamics water temperature suspended sediment and mineralization were mainly used to determine the water density in the given freshwater reservoir herein the water temperatures and conductivity for both inflow and reservoir were measured on a monthly cycle through ysi the reservoir s water mineralization was derived from the linear equation reported by lyubimova et al 2014 and tishchenko et al 2019 the field measured sediment datasets were reported in detail by yin et al 2016 but they only concentrated on the flood season for the lack of sediment data in the dry season the measured turbidity in april and may was chosen to invert the sediment concentration and the regression relationship between them can be found in ji et al 2010 the hydrological datasets including water temperature water level and inflow outflow discharge were observed at the xiluodu and xiangjiba hydrologic stations http www ctgpc com cn sxjt sqqk the meteorological elements including air temperature and wind parameters see table 1 were observed at suijiang station http www cma gov cn the position of both hydrologic and meteorological stations is shown in fig 1b all of the above hydrological and meteorological data were measured in 2014 and used for model simulation in addition the vertical temperature profiles in xjb02 xjb05 and xjb06 see fig 1b were monitored monthly in 2014 utilizing a thermistor sensor these data were used for model verification 2 3 density difference calculation the density flow which has a considerable impact on the hydrodynamics in the reservoir is induced by the inflow reservoir density difference the difference in this fresh reservoir is mainly brought about by the spatial discrepancy of water temperature or suspended sediment as well as the water mineralization herein at any given temperature t the water density ρ t is computed using eq 1 martin et al 1999 1 ρ t 1 t 288 9414 t 3 9863 2 508929 2 t 68 12963 1000 the water density induced by the sediment concentrations ρ s is derived as the following shi et al 2022 2 ρ s ρ w 1 ρ w ρ s o l i d h the water density induced by the water mineralization ρ m obeys the following law lyubimova et al 2014 3 ρ m ρ w 0 702 m where ρ w and ρ s o l i d are the water and sediment density kg m3 respectively h and m are sediment concentration kg m3 and the mass concentration of dissolved salts kg m3 2 4 model description and set up 2 4 1 3d hydro thermodynamic model after the impoundment of the xjb the water depth increased and the water surface width expanded for most deep river type reservoirs in the yangtze river basin the vertical scale 100 m is much smaller than the longitudinal 100 km and lateral scales 1 km for such a small aspect ratio depth width depth length the shallow water assumption is valid which means that the vertical momentum equation is reduced to the hydrostatic pressure relation therefore vertical accelerations are assumed to be small compared to gravitational acceleration and are therefore not taken into account 3d flow and thermal conditions were simulated employing delft3d flow packages to solve the rans equations for incompressible fluids over whole depth under the hydrostatic and boussinesq assumptions the convection diffusion equations were also solved for water and material transport delft3d flow packages have been widely used in lakes rivers and reservoirs to address produce the hydro thermodynamic processes with high accuracy dissanayake et al 2019 2020b de carvalho bueno et al 2021 morovati et al 2022 this model took into account the baroclinic effect on density flow a significant hydro thermal dynamic factor in reservoir investigations we used k ε turbulence model to predict the vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity we also utilized the alternative direction implicit adi technique to solve the equations with second order precision in time and space the velocity and water temperature distributions could be derived by executing this model the study region encompasses the xjb s mainstream which has a total length of 160 km see fig 1b horizontally the study area adopts an orthogonal curved grid with a cell size being 150 m longitudinal 80 m lateral in the vertical direction due to the steep bed slope v shaped valley in the study region the σ coordinates would produce numerical errors in the positions of the density iso surfaces cornelissen et al 2004 therefore the z coordinates were employed in the model in total 50 vertical layers were used with thicknesses of 3 m based on the size of the grid cell a time step of the 30 s was set in this model two open boundaries were set including the inlet and outlet boundaries fig 1b the inlet boundary was located downstream of the xld dam fig 1a it was established by the daily average water temperature and flow discharge see fig 2a b and table 1 observed at the xiluodu station the outlet boundary near the xjb dam was defined by using the water temperature and water level fig 2a b and table 1 measured at the xjb station for the real settings of water intakes and spillways of the dam a total of 8 intakes with their intake height ranging from 342 m 357 m 12 upper holes top elevation is 354 m and 8 middle spillway holes bottom elevation is 342 m for releasing flood discharge from a height range perspective the intakes and spillway holes are basically overlapped consequently we set two huge 3 d gates one is set from the riverbed to 342 m and the other is from 357 m to the water surface so that a big mouth 342 357 m can be left for discharge under this hypothesis we think the combined effects of both intakes and spillway devices have been considered due to the both the water intakes and spillways setting in the middle upper layer 342 357 m 3 d gates were used to splice into intakes in the model the riverbed was assumed to be an impermeable slip boundary and the manning equation was utilized to model the bed friction see table s1 in the supplementary material sm file since the water level is regulated variably so do the shorelines to maintain the mass and momentum conservation in the developed model a wetting drying algorithm was used to define the model boundaries deltares 2014 in addition the meteorological condition has a crucial impact on the water motions and thermal regimes by providing external forces the wind stress and surface heat flux were taken into account in this model the heat flux was computed based on the excess temperature heat model at the air water interface modeling the effect of a thermal discharge deltares 2014 according to this model the heat transfer coefficient mostly depends on the water temperature and wind speed the wind stress impact on the water surface was considered in the developed model see table s1 in the sm file thus we collected the daily meteorological data at the suijiang station fig 2c d and table 1 2 4 2 water age model the retention time of the inflow water was described using water age different from the overall retention time v q the water age was a local concept and the age in the reservoir can be unequal at different layers in the water age model the conservative tracer was used to mark the inflow water the water age of the tracer was set to zero when the tracer was first introduced into the reservoir and it increased with time unless the tracer flowed out of the reservoir the surrounding water usually has a greater retention time than the inflow water entering the reservoir so that the water transport path can be intuitively distinguished wu et al 2016 thus water age was an excellent predictor of the flow pattern and thermal structure water age was calculated from the tracer concentrations and its age concentrations the transport equations used to calculate these concentrations are as follows deleersnijder et al 2001 4 c t u c w c z d h c z d v c z 5 α t u α w α z d h α z d v α z c 6 a α c where the variables c α and a are the tracer concentrations age concentrations and water age respectively u u v and w denote the velocity components in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively d h is the diffusivity value in the horizontal direction and d v is the diffusivity value in the vertical direction is the hamiltonian operator x y the water age model herein was constructed by altering the typical advection diffusion components in the code packages in accordance with eq 4 6 where the changed codes can be seen in the data availability section

correctness of the simulations the mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse are utilized 7 m a e i 1 n x o b s i x mod e l i n 8 r m s e i 1 n x o b s i x m o d e l i 2 n fig 3 shows the water temperature verification at three monitoring points along the mainstream including xjb02 xjb05 and xjb06 the location of these monitoring points is shown in fig 1b the predicted vertical

and stratified periods as seen the developed model tends to underestimate surface temperature over the stratified period greater accuracy is attributed to the mixing period in both surface and bottom locations the corresponding mea and rmse values at the surface layer are 0 63 and 0 80 respectively and for the bottom layer are 0 57 and 0 79 respectively these well validated results shown in figs 3 and 4 indicate that the developed 3d hydro thermodynamic model is capable of reproducing the seasonal changes in thermal stratification and water temperature 3 results 3 1 physicochemical property 3 1 1 density difference in reservoirs the flow field is greatly influenced by the density flows which are caused by spatial distributions of the water temperature or suspended sediment franca 2017 munoz et al 2020 in this study the temperature induced sediment induced as well as mineralization induced density differences are calculated respectively fig 5 for the former the temperature difference between inflow and hypolimnion water in the reservoir is considered this is mainly due to a large temperature difference between inflow and hypolimnion water in the reservoir during the stratification period fig s1 which would be a primary factor than the inflow surface one in driving density flows for the latter the sediment and mineralization derived by the conductivity difference between the inflow and reservoir waters is considered where the sectional sediment concentration and mineralization in mean are collected for both inflow and reservoir waters in the yangtze river the suspended sediment concentration has decreased severely over the last decades due to the large number of dams being built within the jinsha river s catchment while the thermal processes in those reservoirs are significant sun et al 2021a and 2021b consequently the average density difference induced by the sediment 0 01 kg m3 calculated by eq 2 is far lower than that induced by the temperature 0 48 kg m3 calculated by eq 1 as shown in fig 5a from the perspective of a season the density difference shows significant seasonal variations as shown in fig 5b during the dry season the sediment induced density difference calculated by the turbidity data fluctuates around 0 01 kg m3 the corresponding temperature induced density difference ranges from 0 1 kg m3 to 1 kg m3 in the xjb in the dry season shown in fig 5a which is far greater than the sediment induced density difference during the flood season as shown in fig 5b i e june october the sediment induced density difference increased slightly and ranged from 0 01 to 0 05 kg m3 however the temperature induced density difference in this season rose sharply and the maximum value can be 1 50 kg m3 dozens of times as much as the sediment in addition in this freshwater reservoir the mineralization dissolved salinity is relatively small with conductivities between 320 and 410 μs cm for both the upper and lower reaches fig s2 the induced density difference calculated by eq 3 is on the order of 0 01 kg m3 significantly smaller than the density difference due to temperature figs 5a and 5b moreover the spatial conductivities are presented in figs 6s 6x with evenly vertical distributions in upper reach xjb01 xjb03 vertical difference 0 3 7 μs cm and slight variation in lower reach xjb04 xjb06 vertical difference 7 22 7 μs cm as a result we have assumed that there were no significant salinity gradients based on this small vertical difference in the reservoir water column and therefore no density gradient to summarize we concluded that the xjb s thermal regime is the most influential factor regulating the hydrodynamic process 3 1 2 spatial environmental and ecological indexes in spring the spatial environmental and ecological index profiles including water temperature turbidity and chlorophyll a are shown in fig 6 the profiles xjb01 xjb06 are measured along the reservoir from the upstream to the downstream in the spring season the position of these measured profiles can be seen in fig 1b during this season the temperature is stratified in the lower reach xjb04 xjb06 see fig 6d f while mixed uniformly in the upper reach xjb01 xjb03 see fig 6a c of the xjb in the lower reach the seasonal thermocline developed at around a depth of 55 75 m where a weak diurnal stratification occurs randomly in the upper depth of 0 20 m due to the measured time of the day the turbidity in the reservoir is relatively small within 10 ftu the vertical profiles change from the nearly uniform structure in the upstream fig 6g i to the weak stratification in the downstream fig 6j l similarly the conductivity profiles measured along xiangjiaba reservoir show consistent trends for either upstream mixing or weak downstream stratification field observations in this season reveal that the vertical distribution of chlorophyll a is basically consistent with thermal structures in the upper reach see fig 6m o but not downstream however the chlorophyll a in the downstream xjb04 xjb06 see fig 6p r is always more abundant in the surface layer which seems consistent with the temperature of the water surface fig 6d f this is related to the thermal structures where the downstream experienced stratified condition while the mixed condition dominated the upper reach in addition the reservoir presented higher temperatures than shallow regions upper reach these combined effects would explain higher chlorophyll a distribution in the surface layer mullin et al 2020 3 2 hydrothermal dynamic process 3 2 1 longitudinal vertical cross sectional thermal structures to analyze the thermal structures in this reservoir the longitudinal vertical distributions of the water temperature in the xjb are sorted from january to december in fig 7 and the corresponding flow patterns gray arrows are depicted in this figure as well as shown in fig 7 the thermal regimes in the xjb show seasonal variation features i e the vertical temperature structure is stratified from april to august while mixed uniformly in other months from january to march fig 7a c although the temperature difference exists between the inflow and reservoir waters fig s1 the generated water temperature gradients in the vertical direction of the reservoir are relatively small 0 15 c m gray et al 2020 this is mainly due to the formation of underflow and unidirectional flow these macroscopic hydrodynamic processes tend to promote water mixing in the reservoir song et al 2009 ceng et al 2016 from april to august fig 7d h a tangible pattern i e thermal stratification is observed according to the spatial evolution of the water temperature in april the inflow water temperature is warmer than the reservoir middle lower water fig s1 fig 7d so that the inflow water floats above the thermocline of the reservoir as a result the maximum vertical temperature gradient can be higher than 0 15 c m resulting in temperature stratification in the reservoir in this season the thermal stratification stretches from 60th km to 150th km 90 km away from the dam covering a broad range within 60th km to upstream the water depth gradually decreases and more water channel features are presented and thus the thermal buoyancy induced stratification disappears with the continuous increase in inflow temperature from may to june the temperature of the surface water temperature rises while the temperature of the bottom remains almost unchanged the vertical stratification is strengthened and its range is enlarged in the longitudinal direction due to the increase in the surface bottom temperature difference since july the thermal stratification has been alleviated i e the epilimnion is thickened while the hypolimnion is compressed and the stretch of the thermal stratification along the thalweg is decreased from 100th km to 150th km 50 km to dam front this is due to the great inflow discharge in the flood season 104 m3 s see fig 2a inducing strong vertical turbulence and making the hypolimnion water mix fast with that in the upper layer this turbulent behavior is enhanced again in august with increasing flow discharge leading to further weakening of thermal stratification with the hypolimnion water shrinking in both vertical and longitudinal directions in september fig 7i the stratified thermal structure recesses with its spatial reach shrunk to none in the following months fig 7j l the inflow temperature was closer to the reservoir water and the reservoir achieved a mixing state 3 2 2 longitudinal vertical cross sectional flow patterns velocity profiles along the thalweg of the xjb are illustrated in fig 8 throughout the year the velocity magnitude is relatively small in the lower reach of the xjb lacustrine zone however from the downstream to the upstream the velocity increases as the water depth decreases especially in the upstream xjb riverine zone the flow rate is magnified dozens of times the macroscopic flow patterns in the large reservoir depend closely on the thermal regimes as the duration of velocity stratification overlaps with the temperature stratification by a large margin the flow field in the reservoir shows seasonal variations a typical flow pattern is found consisting of an upper layer warm water flow in the epilimnion overflow and a lower layer circulation in the hypolimnion which occurred mainly in the stratification periods and occupied 51 in an annual cycle fig 8 m underflow and unidirectional flow are also remarkable flow paths accounting for 7 and 41 fig 8 m respectively persistent underflow conditions mainly occurred before the long stratified periods during which the inflow temperature was slightly lower than that of the reservoir during other mixed periods the upper and lower layers experience almost identical velocity as a result downward flows occupy almost the entire reservoir in the first two months of the cooling periods january and february the upstream inflow tends to intrude into the reservoir s lower layer this is because the inflow water with low temperature is slightly denser than the reservoir s surface water in this season underflow and unidirectional flow are predominant fig 8a b since march the inflow water temperature has gradually increased when the temperature is greater than the reservoir water the reservoir provides denser water than the inflow water thus floating on the reservoir in the form of a downward buoyant flow meanwhile a clockwise circulation in the hypolimnion is generated fig 8c h from the seasonal scale this circulation structure is not stable but a process of formation development and extinction among them in the formation stage march april the circulation structure is formed initially with the increasing water temperature in the longitudinal direction its influencing range can be traced back to the middle or even upper reach of the reservoir where the hypolimnion water is transported to the 60th through the circulation in may june as the inflow water temperature continues to rise the enlarged water temperature discrepancy between the inflow and the reservoir further stabilizes this flow structures and the water transport scopes of the circulation are further expanded to the 30th km i e as far as 120 km away from the dam in july the circulation in the hypolimnion shrunk for both the longitudinal and vertical directions and gradually disappeared in august this is due to the intensified turbulent diffusion caused by the great inflow discharge fig 2a after september the surface bottom velocity difference decreases with the enhanced turbulent mixing induced by the sharp upstream inflow discharge as a result the flow is unidirectional in the reservoir fig 8i l to summarize although the calibrated and validated 3d model could well reproduce the spatial and seasonal distribution of thermal stratification the macroscopic flow patterns during the stratified periods are established only on the basis of the performed computational experiments however this kind of flow consisting of a surface overflow and hypolimnion circulation or reverse flow in the bottom layer was inferred or estimated in several references such as in kala reservoir li et al 2014 and xiluodu reservoir xie 2018 3 2 3 water age distributions in the longitudinal vertical plane water age at any location is utilized to depict the elapsed time for water parcels from the inflow different from the turnover timescale i e the ratio of reservoir volume v to inflow discharge q sun et al 2021a and 2021b the water age is a local concept and the age in the reservoir can be unequable at different layers especially when the water temperature and flow are stratified the retention time of the surface and bottom layers would have a significant discrepancy fig 9 shows the monthly average water age in the longitudinal vertical plane the same thalweg positions and periods as fig 8 the water age in the riverine zone is homogeneous throughout the year however the majority of the reservoir s areas are deep enough to exhibit mixing and stratification patterns in the varying seasons during the mixing period in autumn and winter as shown in figs 9a b and 9i l the water age near the dam is less than 20 days which can also be estimated according to the turnover timescale v q the water age in the hypolimnion layer rises gradually during the stratification period which is greater than the epilimnion layer in the spring and this trend remains constant until summer see fig 9c h this phenomenon is due to the combination of the thermocline induced hindrance and hypolimnion circulation loops in this season which have an obstructed effect on the vertical water exchange to be specific the water age in the upper layer in this season is small but increases downward longitudinally with its age value following the turnover timescale v q this is mainly because the inflow water enters as a buoyant surface flow which flows on the thermocline without hindrance however affected by the hypolimnion circulation in this season the cold water in the lower layer is trapped as a result the bottom cold water age will accumulate severely no longer consistent with the turnover timescale in march the circulation initially forms in the lower layer and the bottom layer s water age can be up to 60 days see fig 9c with the circulation development the bottom water age continues to increase see fig 9d h and can be up to four months in june see fig 9f after july as the inflow discharge increases significantly the vertical turbulent mixing is intensified so that the high age deep water layer is gradually compressed and completely disappears until august in brief the ranges of the lower layer water age are basically consistent with the corresponding flow circulations while the age of the upper layer follows the path of surface warm water movement 3 3 seasonal variations of water temperature and age in typical regions a transition from the river to the xjb exists since it is categorized as a channel type reservoir with a large longitudinal scale the hydrodynamics and water temperature along the reservoir show different seasonal spatial variations in this study we select the typical regions i e the riverine transition and lacustrine zone the positions can be seen in fig 1b to analyze the spatial difference between the thermal structure and water age in the xjb as shown in fig 10 and fig 11 as shown in fig 10 a c the vertical water temperature distribution is relatively uniform throughout the year in the riverine zone in contrast in the lacustrine zone the stratification occurs from april to august and the thermocline position shifts downward correspondingly from the surface and bottom water temperatures perspective as shown in fig 10 d f the surface and bottom layers temperatures in the riverine zone basically coincide throughout the year in the lacustrine the surface and bottom layers temperatures separate from the beginning of april and coincide with the end of august the maximum discrepancy in this period can be up to 8 70 which occurred in mid july the water temperature in the transition zone is in a state of weaker stratification i e shorter stratified duration and advanced maximum surface bottom temperature difference in june 7 35 in addition for the lacustrine zone of xjb a thick thermocline with dual layers is produced mainly in may july the rising surface water temperature during the heating periods promotes the generation of the upper thermocline layer which is primarily affected by meteorological factors such as great solar radiation and high air temperature meanwhile the large inflow discharge in this season increases the shear stress on the thermocline making the upper hypolimnion cold water participates in the turbulence energy transfer thus the hypolimnion scope shrinks and a lower thermocline is formed in the reservoir with the further inflow discharge increase in flood season the cold water in the hypolimnion is involved in turbulence which would be entrained to the metalimnion or epilimnion until the down cline disappears the dual thermocline phenomenon is the combination of both net air water heat exchange and epilimnion buoyant warm flow a comparison of the water ages in three zones shows that the riverine water age is stable at about 2 days throughout the year mainly due to the small water depth the large flow velocity and rapid renewal in the water column see fig 11 however the lacustrine water age begins to stratify in mid march and can last until the end of august specifically as depicted in fig 11f the surface water age is small throughout the year in contrast the bottom water age increased almost linearly from 38 days in mid march to a maximum of 115 days in mid july with an average growth rate of approximately 0 67 days day highlighting that a low water exchange occurred between the bottom and surface during this period since mid july the bottom water age sharply reduced and basically coincided with the surface water age 5 days in september during this period the bottom water age dropped severely at a rate of 2 21 days day this was mainly due to the inflow discharge increase during the flooding season enhancing the vertical turbulent mixing and breaking the stratified structure to renew the bottom water overall by comparing the riverine transition and lacustrine water temperature and age we can conclude that the stratification duration surface bottom temperature difference and the bottom water age renewal are varied significantly with the water depth increase along the reservoir 4 discussion 4 1 role of the inflow on the hydro thermal processes in the reservoir in general reservoirs are regarded as semi natural water bodies gozdowski et al 2022 but they differ from lakes in multiple ways li et al 2013 mostafa et al 2021 previous research has found that in a stratified lake the thermal stratification is influenced by surface heat flux and wind stress which further contributes to the development of the flow circulations stevens et al 1996 ulloa et al 2018 ishikawa et al 2021 the wind induced component is frequently transient and has a tendency to cancel out in the mean but the thermally driven component i e the baroclinic effects is more constant wu et al 2021 in addition to surface heat flux and wind stress this study found that in large channel type reservoirs the inflow temperature and discharge can also be dominant factors affecting the thermal structure and flow patterns three sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate address the potential forcing mechanisms by separately eliminating the wind induced momentum m1 surface heat flux m2 and inflow m3 while holding other forcing components constant see table s2 for parameter settings fig s4 s9 shows the results of the thermal structure and flow patterns with hypothetical situations m1 m3 obtained by the hydrodynamic model in the case of m1 the wind stress was not taken into account and was set to zero thus the hydrodynamics in this scenario was mainly driven by the surface heat flux and inflow flux the impact of the wind induced surface momentum fluxes can be evaluated by comparing the results in base m0 and m1 slight discrepancies exist between these two scenarios m0 and m1 for example the alteration of the thermal regimes is limited on the surface layer fig s4a b and s5a this is because the wind induced mixing is usually confined in the topmost layer the frequency of occurrence of the unidirectional flow and the potential underflow are decreased and increased respectively fig s9 and this discrepancy is mostly seen in december fig 8 and fig s6 however the wind driven mixing is expected to have a small impact on the xjb due to multiple reasons firstly the narrow channel reservoir s shape provides less effective surface area for wind stress secondly the mountain on both sides of the reservoir has a certain shielding effect on the wind resulting in mild wind speeds 99 of the values 2 5 m s fig 2c thirdly the reservoir lacustrine zone is mainly characterized by the deep waters water depth 100 m and the wind cannot overturn the whole water column in the scenario m1 without wind the water temperature structure in the vertical direction fig s4b as well as the thermal stability sst fig s5g are generally close to the base case m0 including the duration strength and evolution of the stratification correspondingly the flow patterns in m1 fig s6 are similar to that in m0 during both mixing and stratified periods i e featured a unidirectional flow or a potential underflow during the mixing period combination of the epilimnion overflow and hypolimnion circulation during the stratified periods fig 8 and fig s6 this suggests that wind stress plays a minor effect in forming the thermal stratification and driving the flow patterns in case m2 the surface heat flux is set to zero hence its effect on the hydro thermal processes can be obtained by comparing it with m0 changes in surface heat flux have a trifle influence on the thermal structure and this influence is enlarged during the mixing period fig s4a c this is because both lower radiation and air temperature in this period fig 2d reduce the net heat flow leading to negative buoyancy fluxes and lowering the surface water temperature fig s5b moreover given no surface heat flux the flow patterns are altered into the potential underflow in this period except for the flood season september and october see fig s7 on the contrary the positive surface flux during the stratified periods could raise surface water temperature and thus enhance thermal stability fig s5h however the thermal structure i e thermocline position stratified duration see fig s4c and flow patterns dominated by epilimnion overflow and hypolimnion circulation see fig s7 in m2 showed remarkable resemblance with the base run m0 suggesting the surface heat flux has a relatively limited influence on the hydro thermal processes case m3 contained purely inflow driven barotropic discharge and baroclinic temperature dynamics as both the wind induced surface momentum flux and surface heat flux are set to zero the thermal structure in this scenario fig s4d showed great resemblance with the m1 and m2 as well as the base run m0 suggesting the inflow flux plays an essential role in the thermal structure from fig s8 the spatial distributions of flow patterns in m3 during the mixing period showed a slight distinction from the other cases m0 m2 mainly reflected in the presence of the underflow or unidirectional flow however during the stratified period a common phenomenon can be found i e the flow currents featured an epilimnion overflow and hypolimnion circulation in the simulations m0 m3 this further confirms the dominance of inflow flux in driving the flow patterns 4 2 thermocline descent during the stratification period the pycnocline thermocline in the xjb is a region between the upper and lower layers with elevated density gradients in the vertical directions which could develop as the water column in the lake reservoir stratifies during spring and summer noori et al 2019 it initially forms near the surface but tends to move downward as the stratification strength increases as shown in section 3 2 figs 10b and 10c previous scholars have extensively demonstrated that lakes thermocline decline was affected by wind induced currents and vertical thermal convection meanwhile the relevant empirical formulas between the thermocline decline rates and the influencing factors are established pollard et al 1973 imboden et al 1995 however the thermocline decline in the river type deep reservoirs is influenced greatly by the water flow demonstrated in section 4 1 but this research is rare the development of the thermocline in the xjb is depicted in fig 12a by a contoured map of the buoyancy frequency squared i e n 2 n 2 g ρ ρ z which is calculated from the density profiles ρ z fischer et al 1979 simpson et al 2021 significant stability gradients n 2 10 5 s 2 are observed in the upper water of the xjb after late march or early april and a more intense gradient n 2 10 4 s 2 is formed just below the surface and rapidly dropping to the elevation of 340 m water depth 35 m thereafter this thermocline slowly deepened from april to august with a high gradient interface with a value of 5 10 4 s 2 the inflow warm water is restricted on the stabilized thermocline during the stratified period fig 7d h and the flow currents in the reservoir are stratified into two layers i e an upper layer warm water flow and a lower layer circulation in hypolimnion fig 13b the upper layer experiences a greater velocity than the lower layer shown in fig 13a thus a shear layer is generated to enhance the turbulence induced diffusion and further increase the mixing of upper and lower layers derived from the model velocity data in fig 12b we show a corresponding contoured map of the shear squared i e s 2 u z 2 v z 2 where u and v are the longitudinal and cross sectional velocity components respectively the color scale is the same as the n 2 plot so that the identical colors correspond to the order unity of the richardson number i e r i n 2 s 2 tanimoto et al 2020 simpson et al 2021 high gradient regions in n 2 and s 2 have a tendency to follow each other as they decline over time throughout the stratification phase but the occurrence of high s 2 is visibly more sporadic in time than the continuous progression of n 2 these graphs of n 2 and s 2 indicate a thermocline in a condition of borderline stability with shear peaks triggering mixing events the shear layer is just located on the thermocline where the turbulent energy dissipation ε and the vertical eddy diffusivity both vary inversely with the richardson number ri as shown in figs 12c and 12d during the formation phase of the stratification the ri increases from 100 to 103 correspondingly the ε drops from 10 7 to 10 11 w kg and the d v drops from 10 2 to 10 6 m2 s this suggests that the turbulent energy is dissipated slowly and the turbulent diffusion is inhibited due to the strengthened buoyance force and vice versa during the weakness phase in this stratified process the shear stress induced by the surface bottom velocity difference will have entrainment on the upper hypolimnion layer as a result the upper hypolimnion layer will be a part of the metalimnion or even epilimnion and the hypolimnion scope is shrinking fig 8c h therefore the thermocline descends in the stratification period moreover during the weakening period of the stratification july august with rising inflow discharge the warm overflow in the epilimnion evolved into a buoyant jet and the flow velocity difference between the upper and lower layers is magnified sharply fig 13a thereby the shear stress is enhanced the thermocline is deepened and the hypolimnion is compressed or even disappears due to being withdrawn directly in upper surface intake the epilimnion becomes the main channel for the warm surface flows directly affected by the rising inflow water temperature the epilimnion water which is carried by the surface plume warms faster than the hypolimnion the expanded temperature difference stabilizes the vertical stratified structure and maintains the stable surface flow under these circumstances the water in the epilimnion is renewed rapidly while in the hypolimnion it can be retained for a long time 4 3 ecological implication both the thermal structure and the macroscopic flow patterns are highly correlated with the water age distributions fig 9 during the mixing periods the water flow is either unidirectional or potential underflow allowing the upstream water to flow straight and unimpededly forward into the reservoir without stratification in this period the water age shows substantial uniformity in the vertical direction and its magnitude is similar to the estimation of v q however during the stratified periods the thermocline is formed as a barrier to hinder the water exchange between the lower and upper layers thus the water age shows distinct discrepancies at different layers i e with a low value in the surface layer and a high value in the bottom layer fig 9 meanwhile the water flows in the reservoir are featured by an overflow and a lower circulation on the one hand the inflow warm water behaved as an overflow probably contributing to vertical thermal stratification ishikawa et al 2021 enhancing the thermocline and its hindering effect on the other hand the surface mixed layer is flushed preferentially by the overflow pilotti et al 2014 i e the warm buoyant flow has a minor exchange with the layer below correspondingly the cold water is stuck retained in a hypolimnion loop due to the trap effect of the lower layer circulation and has little exchange with the upper layer water given the combination of the thermocline induced hindrance and circulation loops the cold water in the hypolimnion layer retained largely and water age in this layer can reach up to 115 days in july the hydro thermal processes not only affect the water renewal in the reservoir but can also be relevant for variations of the water environmental indicators affected by large flow velocity and strong vertical turbulence in the riverine and the transition zone xjb01 xjb03 indicators such as turbidity fig 6g i conductivities fig 6s u and chlorophyll a fig 6m o in the water column are mixed uniformly however the water environment becomes heterogeneous due to the increasing stratification duration and strength downward the stratified water column can affect the water quality biological productivity and functional phytoplankton composition and community in the reservoir mullin et al 2020 shilei et al 2020 in the lacustrine zone these indicators including turbidity fig 6j l conductivities fig 6v x and chlorophyll a fig 6p r are stratified in the vertical direction at the lower part of the hypolimnion circulations the water flows upstream ward which can transport bottom water upstream ward as far as 100 km fig 8 which has potential influences on nutrients transport and ecological system especially benthos habitats in addition the macroscopic flow patterns can be associated with algal growth if the inflow water is the primary source of nutrients for the reservoir for example the nutrients from the inflow water can be delivered to the photic zones which are expected to boost phytoplankton growth macintyre et al 2006 rueda et al 2007 accompanied by deep water and relatively low flow velocity in the lacustrine zone a relatively static water environment is provided for the growth of phytoplankton also the thermocline formation restricts the vertical nutrient exchange in the water column so that some nutrients may accumulate in the reservoir surface layer combined with the suitable water temperature the chlorophyll concentrations in the surface layer are higher fig 6p r 5 conclusions by developing a 3d numerical model and using measured data the hydro thermal processes in a sizeable channel type reservoir xjb were explored findings contributed to the existing studies by providing new insights into how hydro thermal processes including thermal stratification and macroscopic flow patterns occur in large channel type reservoirs serious thermal stratification was found in the reservoir from april to august with the maximum surface bottom water temperature difference being 9 c meanwhile a conjoint flow pattern induced by the warm inflow was detected consisting of an upper layer warm flow and a lower layer circulation which was very different from the wind induced pattern in lakes herein the varying seasonal inflow flux played an essential role while the wind stress and the surface heat flux played minor roles mainly when the reservoir is stratified the inflow warm water on the thermocline could produce a shear effect promoting vertical mixing and further contributing to seasonal hypolimnion shrinking the water transport timescale through the reservoir was influenced heavily by the thermal stratification and flow pattern when the stratification was absent the flow was unidirectional the water age was uniform vertically and increased along the reservoir however when the water column was stratified vertically the hypolimnion cold water was trapped severely by the lower layer circulation with the bottom age value being up to 115 days variations in the water timescale would potentially affect the eco environmental system e g serious residence time in hypolimnion suggests a lack of fresh water for a long time this may lead to anoxic conditions and impede sediment released nutrient exchange in the long run the reservoir water quality will be degraded during the stratification and the benthos abundance will be affected ecologically from a hydrothermal point of view our findings provide theoretical and practical support for managing water quality and the aquatic environment in the reservoirs in our simulations we quantified the impacts of the external forces on the large scale hydro thermal processes of the reservoir through averaging in a long time scale we smoothed over the smaller time scale mechanisms e g thermal convection and wind induced internal waves however they will contribute to the evolution of instantaneous flow patterns and thermal structures their inclusions would be a valuable step in developing a high fidelity numerical modeling for example non hydrostatic simulations although the present research brought new insights regarding the qualitative interpretations of the macroscopic flow patterns to ecological indicators section 4 3 the relationships between hydro thermodynamic processes and ecological dynamics are complicated and quantifications of the contribution to phytoplankton dynamics are required in the future it is therefore recommended to extend this model to an ecological hydrodynamic model so as to illustrate the response of dissolved oxygen nutrients and phytoplankton to the hydrodynamic behaviors credit authorship contribution statement lidi shi conceptualization methodology validation data curation formal analysis resources
